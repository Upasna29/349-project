The game also introduces the homing attack that is forced on you and drops every bit of speed you've gained so far.\n\nDespite what has been said about the level design, Zone 4 takes a few steps towards the right direction but it doesn't stop the game from falling on its face, you also have the terrible floaty physics and the poor (re-)designed bosses to also thank for that.\n\nThe music however is great and with the beautiful visuals are very reminiscent of the classic Sonic games are by far the strongest points of this product which thankfully don't collapse with the disappointment of the game. Even the 2.5D models are great other than Sonic's model itself oddly enough.\n\nWhat makes this game bearable is the fact that it's a average platformer game when you don't compare it to its far superior prequels, the length is very great for its price and the online time attack where you can compete against other players that can have you playing for hours to see who can break and exploit the game to the finish line the fastest.\n\nThe game is by all means worth the £6 but you're better off spending a bit more of that money to buy games like DuckTales Remastered and/or Sonic 4 Episode 2, despite them having lower scores on gaming review sites they're superior in everyway.","February 14, 2014","false","40.0"," 113 of 164 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","113","164","2","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Raiyen/recommended/202530/","Raiyen","Defenestration","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Raiyen/","426 products in account","What did you like best about Sonic 2? Was it the original, varied and yet level design? The clever bosses that never repeated an idea? The game design which is involved and challenging, but still only uses one button? Well, you better go play Sonic 2 and 3 then, because this steaming pile of refuse does the exact opposite of everything I mentioned.\n\nThe Sonic sprite is rendered with a shader﻿ to have only the three tones of blue in his Sonic 3 sprites that clashes with everything else in the game including other images of Sonic which are shown with normal shaders.\n\nThe art design is recycled from previous games wholesale with tweaks to upscale it believably to modern resolutions. And I don't mean like Sonic 2's Emerald Hill Zone compared to Green Hill Zone, Splash Hill Zone straight up lifted the tileset from Emerald Hill and there isn't a single new enemy desgin until you get to the third zone.\n\nThe boss designs are also copied shamelessly from the Megadrive games. I will grant Sega that there is purpose in revisiting the classic Ball and Chain Robotnik from Green Hill Zone Act 3 as it is one of the most iconic bosses from that era of gaming. I vocally sighed when I saw the boss of Casino Street Zone (just what you think it is, with a twinge of Carnival Night) was the Neon Claw Robotnik from Casino Night Act 2.\n\nIf that's not bad enough, they completely missed the point of the bosses as well. Oldschool Sonic bosses were great in how they were a quiz of the mechanics taught in the zone. With Ball and Chain, you had to have paitence and basic use of the platform to reach Robotnik and avoid damage. Claw forced you to use the spin dash to go up the walls to avoid him grabbing you and sucking out your rings. Both of the aforementioned things can be completely ignored with the basic application of the homing attack, begging their inclusion at all. They do go into a different and new attack pattern after 5 hits, but why not do something FULLY original if that's your goal?\n\nThe addition of the homing attack adds nothing to the game other than removing any semblance of game design based challenge based upon platforming. There is still plenty of hard work to do though; fighting the incredibly buggy, awful physics (it is possible to *walk* around a loop with no momentum) and puzzles.\n\nYes, I said puzzles. Someone that developed this idea thought that placing a puzzle that completely forced you to a stop until you light up a specific set of torches that lowers a wall to allow you to continue in a franchise where speed and flow are *paramount* was a good idea.\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME FOR ANY REASON. The fact that it was ever considered shippable is insulting. If you want a good modern Sonic game, vote with your wallet for Generations.","July 18, 2013","false","2.6"," 33 of 45 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","33","45","0","6"

Now.. Onto the review.\n\nSonic The Hedgehog 4 really really does not live up to the standards of the original Sonic games on the Megadrive/ Genesis. Quite a big letdown..\n\nThere's quite a few problems I noticed as soon as I started playing... The spindash is really really REALLY slow, even when rolling down hills and after using a speed booster, and many times Sonic just...stopped right in the middle of rolling, unrolling if you go over a ramp or an edge, which left me too slow to make a jump a few times. The physics just do not work well at all.\n\nI only played Splash Hill zone til completion and some of Casino Street, and both just feel like a copy of Greenhill Zone and Emerald Hill Zone combined (but not as good) and Casino Night Zone from. The first boss battle is even the same as the end of Green Hill Zone with Dr Robotnik (now Eggman) in his Egg Mobile-H with the swinging ball.. There's too much rehashing old ideas, which the original games never really did.\n\nFor the fastest hedgehog, he sure has gotten slower.... Things just really don't feel so inspired. The levels look nice, sure, because graphics, but just.. C'mon, make some new levels and don't just heavily reference the old ones to the point they're almost-but-not-quite the same...\n\nThis isn't Sonic The Hedgehog Remastered, it's meant to be a continuation to Sonic and Knuckles.

At first I did. I saw all the nostalgia they're trying to recreate the feeling old Sonic levels with new technology and graphics. It felt like there was nothing new. The more I played, the more it felt like there was a freshness to the old 2D platforming of Sonic. For those who have never played the old Sonic games, they are labyrinth levels that you need to make it to the end. Along the way you collect rings. These rings let you take damage without dying. The rings go spraying everywhere when you get hit. If you have no rings, you will die when you get hit. The game is single player only and offers controller or keyboard support that you setup out of game.\n\nIt feels the same as the original games and not much has changed control wise. There is still one button controls. The one button will make you jump while you're standing or running. If you hold down and push the jump button you will perform a spin dash when you let go of the down. When you are running, you can press down to roll into a ball to kill enemies. New to the series is what I feel is a game changer. A mid air lock on dash. Just hit the jump button in mid air and Sonic will immediately dart to whatever he has targeted. Usually the closest enemy, spring board or item box. This is a game changer because it adds constant momentum that is easy and more efficient than a spin dash that takes a second or so. Just jump and dart in mid air. Its easy and efficient. Not just that, but attacking enemies in the air turns into platforming. It feels like a lot less time wasted gaining momentum. With this new mechanic, I can see why Tails wasn't included in this first episode.\n\nThe game looks great. It has detailed backgrounds and bright vibrant colors. There are four main areas, each with three levels and a boss fight. Each area has a theme from a previous Sonic game. There is no new territory. Consider it a best of rather than a new album. With that said, Sonic 4 takes them in interesting new directions every so often unique to Sonic 4. One level features a lot of cannons that Sonic can hop in and control where he shoots out. Another level has Sonic in a mine cart and keeping his balance on rolling boulders. You'll see Sonic in the dark carrying a torch, lighting things on the wall to open doors and activate platforms. It all feels fresh, even if it steps away from the Genesis. There are still classic Sonic tropes like using pinball flippers, bouncing off bumpers, going through loops, swinging from vines, using zip lines (Sonic Advance) and so on.  There are a few moments of going underwater. While underwater, Sonic just moves slower. He can't actually swim.\n\nThe items feel limited to the ones found in Sonic 1 and 2. You can get temporary invincibility, ten rings, an extra life, super speed shoes and a bubble shield that lets Sonic take an extra hit.\n\nEven with only 4 areas to visit, there are still 13 levels (not including boss fights). Each level is around five minutes to complete. I hate to say it, but it feels like a full length Sonic game, even if this is only episode 1. It runs around the three hour mark. The boss fights evoke nostalgia. Their patterns are like the original games, but they add new twists.\n\nSonic 4 does a good job of utilizing Sonic's speed. A lot of the previous 2D games had you go at your own pace, but Sonic 4 has you chased by boulders, crushing walls, running after Dr. Robotnik in boss fights. These reasons for Sonic to run feel engaging more than typical exploring the levels. It offers a variety.\n\nSince you are collecting rings, if you complete the level and have more than 50 rings, you'll see a giant ring to jump into that sends you to the bonus stage. Even the bonus stage feels good. Its a take off of the original Sonic 1 bonus stage, but this time you get to control the rotation of the level while Sonic is just stuck in a ball. There are barriers that need coins to pass through. At the end of each bonus stage is a chaos emerald.\n\nAs you progress, you will unlock levels and areas as you progress. So if you get stuck on a level, you can skip it. After each level it gives you a choice to jump to the next unfinished level. That just feels odd. While its helpful to have level selection, I'd much rather progress to the next level instead of getting asked.\n\nWhile this might be a departure from the old Sonic games, it adds new life to what was a stale franchise if you include the Genesis and Gameboy Advance platformers. The challenge feels good, its more difficult than the other old school games.","November 11, 2014","true","6.0"," 32 of 45 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","32","45","0","0"

Ultimately I am recommending this game because I enjoyed my time with it despite it having a fair number of flaws. I will explain further ahead, I just wanted to get this out of the way first.\n\nSonic the Hedgehog 4 is the sequel to the critically acclaimed classic, Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (& Knuckles), a game that, in my opinion, did not require a sequel. Because of how successful Sonic the Hedgehog 3 (& Knuckles) was, it's almost guaranteed that Sonic the Hedgehog 4 will be disappointing to any long-term Sonic fan in some way or form, but that isn't to say that the game is a complete disaster, it's actually quite fun if you can overlook some of the bad features it has, which I will cover next.\n\nRight off the bat you will see that this game does not play like any other 2D Sonic game in the past, there is barely any sense of speed and the physics actually feel worse than those in the first and original Sonic the Hedgehog. Spin dashes often slow down your momentum rather than increase your speed and jumping feels very clunky most of the time, this can be especially frustrating on the Casino Street Act 2 stage where you have to use careful platforming to jump across a bridge of moving cards.\n\nPoor physics aside, the levels and stages are fun to play for the most part, but they are sadly just rehashes of previous levels from the older Sonic games, just branded with new names. Splash Hill for example is the same as Green Hill, Casino Street is a mix of Casino Night and Carnival Night, Lost Labyrinth is naturally very similar to Labyrinth from the first game and Mad Gear is Metropolis from Sonic the Hedgehog 2. The boss fights are also rehashes of bosses from the same levels they are almost direct clones of. Sonic the Hedgehog 4 as a sequel was essentially expected to have some new levels, unique areas and boss fights, but there are none of the above featured in this game. Everything will feel familiar but different, and unfortunately not in the good way like Sonic Generations was able to accomplish.\n\nWhat this game (or Episode, as Episode II is supposedly better and I haven't gotten to it yet) lacks is originality, something that all the old games managed to achieve so effortlessly, with all levels and bosses feeling unique despite being so limited at the time, so ultimately as a sequel, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 is a disappointment. As a standalone Sonic game however, it can be a fun experience if you take it for just that and not the "successor" to one of the best games ever made, similar to Doom vs Doom 3 as the first example that comes to mind.\n\nYes, this game has a lot of problems and lacks originality, but I still found it to be fun and I enjoyed my time with it, that is why I'm ultimately going to go for "yes" as opposed to "no". Long-term Sonic fans, take it from another seasoned Sonic the Hedgehog player, you are most likely going to be disappointed, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that you won't enjoy it at all, it takes a little bit of adapting to get used to the the new feeling of movement in this game, but once you get the hang of it, it's a fun to play.\n\nSo that's about it, you will either enjoy your time with this or you won't. In the end, my advice is to play it and judge it for yourself.","May 29, 2015","true","10.5"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","0"

It was perceived as being bad likely because it changed the formula of the classic Sonic games and people didn't like that. Had it not been titled "Sonic 4," a lot of the negative reception would be diminished considerably, since many simply didn't think it was a worthy successor to the classic games. You have to look at a game both as part of a series and individually in order to have a valid opinion of it, and that's exactly what I plan to do in this review.\n\nTo begin with, I like the visuals and art style (although cel-shaded Sonic looks a bit odd). The music is enjoyable, despite what some have said, and the level design is definitely on par with the classic games, albeit slightly more linear. Of course, one of the major additions this time around is the Homing Attack, a move that many felt didn't work in a classic-style 2D Sonic game. In my opinion, it's just as well-implemented as in many of the other recent 2D games, like the Rush series and Generations on 3DS. Now onto the physics. Literally EVERY REVIEW I have seen of Sonic 4 mentions the physics being poor or "floaty." I myself didn't have any issues with the physics, as they work well with the level design and benefit the player in most cases just as they did in the Rush series, whereas the physics in the classic Sonic games would often lead to frustrating and unnecessary hits or deaths.\n\nMoving on, the bosses are generally pretty easy, although the final boss is relentlessly difficult. The Special Stages are all ♥♥♥♥ing insane, and the last one is quite possibly the cheapest, most unforgiving Special Stage I have ever had the misfortune to play in a Sonic game. I've tried again and again with no luck, so if anyone has some incredible strategy to beat it, please let me know. Anyway, the Zones themselves are actually pretty creative (especially Casino Street, with the various playing card elements) despite being mainly based on level tropes from the classic Sonic games, but aren't really memorable, with the exception of Mad Gear Zone. That ♥♥♥♥ is epic.\n\nOf course, as with the classic games, there are a few cheap deaths and unfair tricks in the game that can become incredibly frustrating, but nothing too big besides the aforementioned final boss and Special Stages. Overall, it's actually a decent game. Maybe it's not a real sequel to the classic Sonic games, and maybe it's flawed, but it's still enjoyable and holds up as an individual game. If you want a true Sonic 4, go buy Sonic Advance, but if this review hasn't convinced you to at least give this game the credit it deserves, then I don't know what will.","February 17, 2014","true","8.0"," 32 of 54 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","32","54","0","0"

By now we're all familiar with legendary mis-steps like Sonic 2k6, Sonic Boom, and Shadow the Hedgehog: The Game. Then there's other games like Sonic Unleashed, Sonic & The Black Knight, Sonic Heroes, and so on and so forth. It's like Sega isn't interested in having Sonic games be about..well..just running fast and jumping on stuff. There needs to be a hundred dozen gimmicks, special abilities, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ friends(tm), and dramatic game-design changes.\n\nI don't know what's best for Sonic, I just know what I like. My favorite games are the 16-bit titles, Sonic Generations, and bits & pieces of the other 3D games (haven't played enough of Colors to form an opinion on that). You're probably thinking: "He likes the earlier games, it must be nostalgia." Maybe it is. So what's a better way to play on my nostalgia than by making a Sonic 4? For starters, they should've just done nothing at all.\n\nEpisode 1 is comprised of 4 zones with three acts a-piece, 7 special stages, and five boss battles. It's a tad on the lean side I guess, but it overstays it's welcome very early on. The first thing that sticks out to me is the poor level-design. Splash Hill Zone is very messy, with a lot of walls, springs, and corridors. It feels awfully claustrophobic for a zone that supposedly takes place outside. Casino Street Zone is mostly just flashing lights and things to bounce off of. The second act features a ton of cards that can be flipped for bonus lives, that's all I can remember about it.\n\nLost Labyrinth Zone is where I was stunned to silence. Act 1 features silly boulder balancing and not much else. Act 2 has Sonic running around in near complete darkness, with only a torch to guide his way. There are also a couple cruddy mine cart sections. Why would Sonic Team create an act where players can't see much of anything? When the concept is thoroughly flawed, no implementation can save it. All I can remember of Act 3 is these weird rooms. Sonic is trapped underwater, and the room has to be tilted, but not too quickly or else he'll get impaled on spikes. This is just no good, no darn good.\n\nMad Gear Zone is a rip-off of Metropolis Zone. I knew I was going to be in for a good time, because Metropolis Zone is my least favorite in Sonic 2. Somehow Sonic Team managed to make it more annoying, with a bunch of mantis robots, exploding starfish, and grinding gears. By this time I just wanted it all to end.\n\nThe final zone is merely a boss-rush, followed by a climatic encounter straight out of Sonic 2. Eggman mixes it up a bit with the boss having a second form and a last ditch final attack. It's the hardest part of the game, though I probably died more times on the first act of Lost Labyrinth. Apparently you can't use the d-pad on the boulders, it's analog or fall off and die.\n\nThe special stages are supposedly based on Sonic 1, except with all of the simplistic wonderment and unique design stripped out. Ever play the arcade game Cameltry? You maneuver a ball by rotating a maze. It's a really fun game. Sonic 4's bonus stages are the same way, except with all the fun stripped out. Worst of all, there's this horrible lullaby that sounds like it came from an infant's toy. Sonic 4 suffers from uncharacteristically awful music, and the special stage tune is the cherry on top.\n\nThe most damning thing I can say about Sonic 4, is that all it does is poorly rip off its superior prequels. If you're familiar with those games you'll recognize everything that happens here. You're seeing all of the same stuff, except it's poorly arranged, with terrible physics, sloppy controls, while looking and sounding positively ghastly. This is a title specifically made to cash in on gamers like me, who are nostalgic for the early games, before ridiculous anime plots and half-baked concepts became the norm. Sega loves to sell their entire Sonic Steam library for a pittance, so you probably already own this game.\n\nIt's evil, don't touch it!","November 17, 2014","false","3.1"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

Continuing where Sonic 3 and Knuckles left off on the Sega Genesis many many years ago, it reveals what happens next in Dr. Robotniks evil scheme, and you're in control of Sonic to stop it.\n\nThe first episode has five levels that you can play in, each with three acts. Sadly, none of these stages are memorable at all.\n\nAt all.\n\nThe level design, however, is nice. It's nothing special, or memorable. One thing I'm upset about and several others are as well, is the abundance of speed boosters. The physics are also very strange as well.\n\nThe music is... ok. However, the sound kit they used to construct seems like it would be a mediocre disco kit from the 90's. The sound effects are nice, though.\n\nA problem many have with this game is not that it's a bad game, but that it's title is Sonic 4. And I too have this problem. I would only recommend this title to Sonic fans. If you're just looking for a fun platformer to pick up and play, this is not the game that you are looking for. All in all, this game is ok.

To satiate the thirst fans of the franchise crying out for a return to the original trilogy. What is still considered to be one of the best games to date by many. But the mark is missed by a want to set the game apart.\n\nThe visuals are adequate and pleasing, but are not remarkable or noteworthy. It looks like a derivative cash in on Sonic The Hedgehog 2's success, yet manages to be less inspiring. While vibrant and varied, it still somehow manages to feel soulless. On top of that, the characters themselves seem to have a cell shaded sheen to them that clashes with the rest of the game and ends up looking awkward.\n\nControls are different from the original games this title was meant to bank on. In order to keep momentum, one must hold in the direction you intend to run in. The spin dash does not gain traction and ends up being the worse option to gain speed in the long run. It's only useful for a short burst if you're looking not to get hit by enemies (which, by the way, seem to be quite scarce and poorly placed). Otherwise the homing attack happens to be your best choice for a speed boost. The stages themselves, though, did feel decently designed and were loyal to the original Genesis games. I, myself, ended up finding more enjoyment in the special stages, though.\n\nFor the audio, much of sound effects, and it almost felt like the soundboard itself, was lifted from Sonic The Hedgehog 2. This would have been awesome if the music wasn't so forgettable. Nothing truly outstanding, unlike the game from which inspired all its audio.\n\nTrue, I have been quite negative, but don't take that as a reason not to play this game. It's still a decent experience worth giving a try. Once you get past the different controls, you can enjoy the game much like you would in the original Genesis titles. If you go into this knowing it's not those games, but instead and game on its own inspired but not completely copied, you can find enjoyment in playing it.","December 5, 2013","true","22.1"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

This is a really good Sonic game. The game took old concepts for levels and created something fresh and new. With platforming puzzles that would use old mechanics in a brand new and interesting way.\n\nAfter 10-15 years of bare bones, turn your brain off Sonic gameplay. I feel the audience for Sonic just didn't want a game like this. Episode 1 will actually challenge you a little bit. You'll find platforming puzzles, because Sonic is a platformer. A shocker to some, I know. I feel that's the main reason why people preferred Episode2 over Ep1. Ep2 looks gorgeous and is completely brain dead.\n\nAlso it's worth noting, the nitpicks about the physics and earning speed are misguided. The physics are 90% the same and there's no meaningful difference between this and the classics. Earning speed is also a talking point parroted by people who didn't want to take the time to figure out what was really bothering them. For example, who complained the spindash in Sonic 2 took the 'earning speed' element out of the game? The real reason why it didn't feel like a Genesis Sonic game was the save system:\n\nThis game was designed to be played through once without having to replay levels. There's no muscle memory or memorization of level layouts, unlike there was in Sonic 1-2.","November 23, 2014","true","4.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

Hit the button too early or too late = instant death. This feels more like a QTE than a Sonic game. The first boss doesn't really have a pattern. You simply stand to the very edge of the screen and time your attacks.\n\nThis game looks like a Sonic game, but it certainly doesn't feel like one at all.","December 28, 2014","false","0.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

It's more like a rehash of old ideas, to be repackaged and sold to younger, more gullible newbies. More than that, this PC version seems to be a 1:1 conversion of the iPad game, with touch and accelerometer controls stripped out, and keyboard/X360 controls shoved in. The Special Stages are particularly evident of this, with their weird "rotate the map to guide Sonic through" mechanic (which wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the timer).\n\nSpeaking of acceleration, and other concepts of physics, don't expect to find any here. Momentum, inertia, all of these things have given way to the designer's favourite force of motion, namely "drag". And it's a really big one. It takes a million years for you to build up any speed, which is a PITA when dealing with precision platforming that depends on you being able to move quickly. To remedy this, the design team has plunked in a little in-air dash mechanic, which works if the auto-targeting dealie hasn't already locked onto something a whole astronomical unit of distance away.\n\nVisually, the game looks shiny, but didn't Megaman 9 and 10 do just fine without needlessly updated graphics? I mean, the design team decided they were going to fudge the model shaders on Sonic to give it that "16-bit/256 Colour" look, but why not just run the full mile and go for the plain 2D sprites? Who needs three dimensions in a side-scroller unless you plan to charge more for...oh wait. Nevermind.\n\nThe sounds and music are awkward, too. Like someone got ahold of some genuine Genesis/Mega-Drive hardware, played around with the sound processor, and instead of using it, he went with modern software and DEP to approximate the Genesis sound. The results are a fuzzy, buzzing mess, not unlike someone having tossed a hornet's nest, some lit firecrackers, and a couple of xylophones into a bin bag, shook it up next to a microphone, and hoped for the best.\n\nOverall, the offering here is pretty much what you'd expect from Sonic Team nowadays. They took something nice and simple, and added as many afterthoughts as they could before the launch date. It's a bit like a five-year-old being given free rein to make his own pizza for the first time. The result is what was once a nice cheese & pepperoni pizza, now topped with a gallon of chocolate sauce, a metric ton of jelly beans, a whole birthday cake, lit sparklers, McDonald's entire supply of double cheeseburgers, and a jar of maraschino cherries. He takes one bite of it, decides he doesn't like it, then shoves it off and says "Here, I made this for you".","January 18, 2015","false","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","1","1","2","0"

You can gain speed but it is so easy to lose it, whether it's because of the rather bad level design or the forced homing attack segments of the stages.\n\nDespite the pace Sonic is capable of reaching, his animations make him look slow and sluggish. On top of this, using the homing attack on an enemy makes you unable to immediately chain in another, meaning there is a forced delay between each enemy hit.

The game is completely functional...but that's all. It's slow, the physics are wrong, the music is just atrocious (Sonic has always had fun, if sometimes cheesy, music. The 16bit songs are video game classics, what happened here?), Sonic always seems to have this weird...sheen on him. It sort of feels as if this was outsourced to a team who had played all the Sonic games beforehand but weren't there at all to make them. It feels like a cheap chinese knock off. Give it a go if you can get it for cheap, it is fully functional in the regards that, yes, it works...but it lacks SO much. Not to mention it's short so getting only Part One would only increase your dissatisfaction. This could have been the ultimate love letter to fans but instead we got cheap plastic non-sense.

Collecting all seven chaos emerald allows Sonic to transform into Super Sonic on the main levels.\n\nIn addition to the story, there is a small number of achievements to add to the experience. Some are unlockable just by playing the game, while some are quite difficult. There is also a leaderboard feature for those who want to compete with the best.\n\nHere is how I would rate the game:\n\nGraphics: 7/10 - Not to much of a fan of the "3D" Sonic sprite, or some of the enemy sprites. Otherwise graphics are nice.\n\nMusic: 7/10 - A good, simple and old-school Sonic soundtrack. Would deduct some for Casino Street music and final boss music, which sounds a bit like a ripoff from Sonic 2.\n\nControls - 10/10 - Controls are simple and easy to master.\n\nGameplay - 8/10 - Gameplay is good. Most levels are possible to beat at the first try, but often more rewarding paths can be found if you know the level. Deducting some points as some levels feel more streamlined than others, and the fact that you can sometimes die from getting hit by an enemy in such a way that you fall into a death trap and get squished.\n\nDifficulty: 7/10 - Certain aspects of the game require numerous tries, which I think makes it good. Certain annoying enemies as well as death traps make it more difficult to reach the special stages. Some of these stages can also be quite difficult to beat. Not to mention the final boss.\n\nI have enjoyed playing this game so far, and would recommend this over of Sonic CD, as it is possible to replay all stages as you want in Sonic 4.\n\nFinal rating 7/10\n\nCrimsonR\n\n***SPOILER!***\n\nCollecting the 7 chaos emeralds and defeating the final boss does not unlock a final battle. Instead, it just reveals a cliffhanger as Metal Sonic is shown, with the words "to be continued" (in Episode 2). Decided to deduct a point on the final rating for this, as collecting the chaos emeralds only to allow invulnability feels a bit wasted.

Sorry.  The princess is in another castle.  Bahahaha VIDEO GAME JOKEZ.\n\nMan, I really wanted to like this game because, yeah, I like Sonic.  He's really only worked in 2d, though (I didn't care for Sonic Adventures, personally).  When I saw this a few years ago I was like oh man, exciting!  A new, potentially good sonic game!  And then all of the disappointment.\n\nThe two biggest factors as to why I don't recommend this game: the engine and the level design.  Graphics are a close third.\n\nThe engine is just kind of meh.  Sonic feels very bulky, heavy and slow in this game.  More than once I've stood on a hill and, after losing momentum, could not actually finish climbing said hill.  I had to go back, get a running start and then run up.  It didn't feel very sonic like and it very much breaks pacing/immersion/fun.\n\nHowever, the level design is what kept me from wanting to finish.  It's just kind of meh overall, like a  bland cut/copy/paste of what a marketing person thinks a sonic game should look like, having looked at the statistics and level design of previous games.  It feels very soulless, much like the New Super Mario brothers series.  Sure, it looks similar to the original Sonic games but it lacks it's own character or creativity.  You can usually safely call where a spike trap will be, for example, because  the placements are so obvious.  That's not bad, necessarily -- you should be able to tell where the pitfalls are going to come up -- but they're predictable in the way that makes the game boring.\n\nWhat really broke my spirits, though, was the third level: the ♥♥♥♥ing water level.  Water levels always kind of suck in Sonic, but in the past I at least appreciated their unique-ness as they did some cool things.  This one doesn't.  One stage has a massive pain in the ♥♥♥ puzzle where you light specific torches at specific times in order to make platforms rise and fall, but the torches burn out so quickly that Sonic's slow, impercise ♥♥♥ can't easily get onto these ledges before they disappear.  I personally was stuck on one part of a stage for a good 5-10 minutes just trying to get Sonic to do what I wanted him to do.  That's not a good game.  Worse still is the boss fight for that stage, which is a race to catch and damage Robotnik.  Except, you know, the race involves very specific jumps while water is rising.  Of course the water slows you down, and at that point why even bother?\n\nNo, I had a pretty bad time with this game and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you really wanted to see how to ♥♥♥♥ up a 2d sonic game.  It just doesn't do much right.  Even Sonic Colors -- a game I also do not like -- was designed better than this.  I really want to like it, but it's just not very good.  If you want a good Sonic game, go check out Sonic Generations instead.","August 16, 2014","false","1.8"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rednavi/recommended/202530/","rednavi","Rednavi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rednavi/","1558 products in account","This is literally one of the worst Sonic games I've ever played, probably worse than Sonic 06 only because that game is so bad it's good, had hilarious glitches and it has a nice soundtrack unlike this... thing. Where to start?\n\nMUSIC:\n\nThe music is awful and uses really bad instruments and boring melodies. There's only 2 or 3 good tracks in the entire game and even then they're all only a handfull of seconds long, which means you'll listen to the very same loop over and over and over and over.\n\nYou would think that's fine because it's a Sonic game after all, you're supposed to finish stages fast. Well? How about the last stage which is a boss rush that can last 8 minutes with ease? And it has two different songs, both terrible and 15 seconds long if not less.\n\nA bit of trivia about the songs. The standard boss song at the beginning of a boss stage is actually an unused song from Sonic 3D blast. You would think SEGA being smart enough to ditch it back then would mean something but NOOOOO! They had to bring that song back from the graveyard and put it here just to make this game even worse.\n\nGRAPHICS:\n\nCan't complain and don't give 2 hedgehogs about what people say about how sonic looks like. Could be worse, he could be Sonic Adventure DX glossy but he's not. Not like that saves this game from being utter crap.\n\nPHYSICS:\n\nKinda funny when you see Sonic fans raging about physics when they talk about this game huh? Yeah I me-NO! IT IS NOT FUNNY! The physics are terrible and it ruins the whole purpose of the game. You don't make a Sonic game with terrible physics, it just doesn't work like that. WHY WOULD YOU DO THIS???\n\nWhy does it have to be like this? Why couldn't you just freaking copy paste the physic stats from the older games? You guys copy pasted pretty much everything else. None of the stages are original, none of the bosses are original, gimmicks are barely interesting if they are even new to begin with.\n\nEverything's pretty much based on the first two games yet they decided to try something new with the only thing they were supposed to keep intact or at least try to as much as possible. Acceleration is crap, spin dashing is useless, momentum barely exists and can be cancelled with ease.\n\nLEVEL DESIGN:\n\nSonic has the homing attack... in a 2D game. That's all you need to know to see where level design will go but let me give you a small explanation about how to design your own Sonic 4 EP I stage!\n\nBoring start -> random hills -> chain of enemy appears! -> homing attack a few times -> BOOSTER -> BOOSTER -> jump\n\nAdd tons of cheap deaths and pits to the equation to make things more unbearable. There isn't as much exploration as in the old games and most of the branches are pretty much "Do this jump/homing attack chain right or else you fall to a longer section of the stage". Last stages can be quite cheap.\n\nBOSSES:\n\nBoring copy pastes from older games. They try to keep things fresh with pinch versions of them but their HP is so low you rarely see them doing anything worth to get worried about. Many of them also have several seconds of forced waiting doing nothing, which kills the pace of the game dramatically.\n\nACHIEVEMENTS:\n\nThey're all doable and most of them are actually pretty fair. The one that requires you to clear the E.G.G. STATION ZONE without taking any damage (Boss rush) is actually fairly challenging, mostly because of some cheap hits you may get across the 8 minutes it can take to get it done.\n\nThey're all fair until we talk about Enemy Hunter, which requires you to kill ONE THOUSAND enemies. A number you will most likely never reach before getting the other achievements. I think my main issue with this achievement is not that it forces you to grind for them wasting your time but rather that it forces you to play this game even more.\n\nOne would think getting the other achievements would be enough punishment but nooooo! You gotta grind for those kills. And the worst part is that it seems to be glitched so you have to get the 1000 kills in one single run of the game. If you close it? BAM! The kill count resets.\n\nOVERALL:\n\nI basically forced myself to fully complete this game, don't ask why, I probably secretly hate myself. I only played it today again after what? Six months? Because I wanted to 100% the game to write a review about how painful it was to kill all those 1000 enemies. Why would I 100% a game I hate so much? So you don't have to! I'm like the Jesus of the Steam reviews! I suffered for you so you don't have to suffer what I went through! Seriously don't try to 100% this game, it only brings pain and nightmares and it's not worth losing 10 years of your lifespan just to get one game fully completed.\n\nI would recommend this to Sonic fans only but the truth is that even they should not play this abomination. I am a damn Sonic fan since the very first game and I hate this game so much is not even funny.\n\nTO SANIC 4 EP I SOCIAL JUSTICE WARRIORS:\n\nThis game is horrible and is not acceptable just because it was the very first Sonic game you've ever played. Don't tell Sonic fans why this game is good (Or even dare to say better than the classics) because you just have no idea what you're talking about. This isn't about opinions, this is about FACTS.\n\nThis game TRIED to be like the old games and failed. This game is not trying to add anything new to the genre or franchise. Fans don't hate change, what fans hate is a horrible game, and oh boy, is this one heck of a horrible game! It's barely a decent platformer and a terrible Sonic game with lousy controls and bad level design. There's no way I would ever defend this game.\n\nYOU'RE YEARS LATE WITH THIS REVIEW, BUDDY:\n\nShut up, not like you're paying me or anything.","May 25, 2014","false","12.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","4"

After playing this game a few more times my opinion has changed. While the music could've done without the synthesizer, some tracks are pretty good like Splash Hill Zone and Super Sonic. I'm still not too fond of the rehashed level designs and ideas, but the game is still fun to play through. Sonic 4-EP 1 uses the Sonic Rush engine which is fine, however putting an engine like that into a console/PC game without the boost makes the game feel extremely awkward. The physics are the worst I've ever had to put up with in a Sonic game. Sonic's acceleration is way too slow, and he uncurls from the spindash as he goes into the air. Also the spindash is extremely useless in this game as well as in EP 2 so I wouldnt use it. I know this review makes me sound like I'm bashing down on this game, but it's actually not too bad.

Splitting my opinion into 5 different categories\n\n\nStory: Eggman or whatever you want to call it is VERY EVIL and he´s doing VERY EVIL things. so you are sonic and must stop it. the end. 4/10\n\nGameplay: The adittion of the homing attack helps. Level design makes you barely even touch the buttons sometimes. Physics are horrible,but after some time you get used to it. The game itself is not very hard,exept the final boss. also you will stack up on lives very easly. 6/10\n\nGraphics: It´s a mixed bag. they look nice but after some time they hurt the eyes a little bit. They are decent... but not for a 2010 game. I personally just care of the graphics if they look good,and this game gets a check. 7/10\n\nSound: As any Sonic game,the music is always a good part of the game,and this is no different. They sound very nice and they are decently composed. The best part of the game. Keep in note also that they did not catch my ears. I don´t renember them besides Splash Hill,as it´s the first level. 8.5/10\n\nLevel Design: Worst part of the game. The level design isn´t very good. As I stated before, there are parts you barely have to press a button. They give you waay too much lives,the designs aren´t original at all, as most bosses and levels are almost the same thing as Classic´s sonic counterpats. Of the for levels of the game(yes,four!) only one is original and it´s the best the game can offer. of all the 5 bosses,only 1 is original. very bad sega,very bad. 3/10\n\n\nFinal toughts:\n\n\nIt´s a good game? Yes and No\nI recommend it? If you  are starting with the sonic series,waste your money on something like the classic sonic games,sonic adventure series or even sonic generations. However,if you find this game in a bundle and you really are a hardcore sonic fan like I am,you´ll probably find some enjoyment out of this game.\n\nFinal score 5.7/10\n\n//Migas","March 15, 2014","true","8.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

People complain that it plays like a Genesis game.... which isn't that the point?? Lets be honest, Sonic the Hedgehog is a title that should have been retired in the 90's. The moment this franchise hit the 3D consoles, it began to suck more than a gay porn star. Yet Sega loves to double down on terrible 3D Sonic games, pumping them out like rabbits, and for an equally bizarre reason there is a section of the fan base that eats it up. In fact, the worse the game, the more these people defend it, "Cuz its da SAWNIK!"\n\nSo when I heard that someone at Sega green lit a throwback title, I was ecstatic! And this game hits the mark right on the head. If you loved the well built, simplistic style of the very original Sonic title, then this game is a true homage to it.\n\nRIGHT: Obviously, someone did their homework here, because this game is everything that the original Sonic was, just with a nice 3D rendered facade. You play as just big Blue himself against Robotnik in four worlds broken up into four stages just like the original title. (3 stages + Boss Stage) Run the three levels, grab some "emwoads", trash Robotnik at the end, hit the canister, and let the little creatures out. Pure, simple, and classic. And while Sonic halls haunch just like he did in the original, he maintains a good pace, rather than flying around the screen like an ADD three year old on a sugar high. Bonus rounds are also a throwback to the first game, with the rotating maze except now you can control the maps rotation rather than hitting speed up and slow down buttons. Super sonic also makes an appearance unlike the original, but doesn't break the game play like he did in other titles. Level design, music, and even some of the boss designs are all taken from the first game with great care and detail.\n\nWRONG: While everything in this game is a delightful trip down memory lane, for some reason the developers decided not make Sonic also look traditional.... No we get the current incarnation Sonic, complete with his long hair, bracelets, green eyes and "hip hop" attitude. Though to be fair, he thankfully doesn't pepper you with insipid banter like he does in recent games, but it still irked me they decided to keep that awful design. This also extends to Robotnik, who is once again called "Eggman" because we simply MUST comply with the Japanese who think naming people after food items is just the END of comedy, and is also packed into the ugly red track suit that looks like a Richard Simmons yard sale leftover. And why? Was anyone seriously thinking that if they didn't keep the crappy current designs that we weren’t going to recognize them? Or more likely it was a pathetic ploy to try and gain a few "SAWNIK" fans to download it.\n\nRegardless, this game is very much worth a download if, like me, you grew up playing the classic Sonic titles. It gets everything right from the original, lush backgrounds, great music, classic looking enemies, rings, loops, springs, and of course "SAWNIK"!","September 4, 2014","true","5.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While it may look like a Sonic game, and sound a bit like a Sonic game, it fundamentally lacks the core components that made the original Genesis-era Sonic games so good: tight, responsive controls, and blazing fast speed.  Sonic 4 lacks both.\n\nControlling Sonic feels sluggish and muted, like he's stuck in molasses.  That's an apt description for the game's speed, too, because even at Sonic's utter fastest you feel like you're barely poking along, the blurring legs of his full-out sprint matching in no way the pathetically slow rate at which the scenery moves.  Not only that, but Sonic retains almost no momentum, slowing down rapidly the moment you take your fingers from the controls.  At first I thought this had all been done to make it easier to see upcoming hazards - a problem in earlier Sonic titles - but the game's zoomed in, over-large view of its new scaled-up art means you get an even smaller view of the world around you than in previous titles, not more.  It makes the whole thing feel claustrophobic, slow, and frankly un-Sonic-like.\n\nI can't recommend this game.  It's one of the most disappointing Sonic titles I've ever played.","June 6, 2014","false","0.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

While I understand that they may be trying to go for a "throwback" to the older games, it is definitely not executed as well or as smoothly as the original games. If you want throwback, I'd recommend you actually buy Sonic 1, 2, 3, and Knuckles as Genesis Classics here on Steam.\n\nThe music is extremely generic and got annoying after a while, especially for the fact that some of the songs sound like remixes or rearragements of Genesis tracks rather than new material.\n\nRemember that the above is my sole opinion.

Sonic 4 ep 1 is clearly influenced the most by Sonic 2, which is my favorite Sonic game for the Genesis anyway so many of the bosses and level designs are taken from that game specifically and that is certainly not a bad thing.

Sonic essentially has no horizontal momentum at all within this game, and is able to immedately stop moving left/rightward as soon as you stop pressing any movement keys. In addition, Sonic has all the initial acceleration of a snail when moving from a complete stop. Those two things together make what should make a simple, fast-moving platforming game annoyingly hard to control, and in sharp contrast to the real Sonic games which have fluid and natural controls, where the character momentum feels right. If it wasn't for the controls, the game would otherwise be decent but completely charmless.\n\nIf you want to play a Sonic game that'll satisfy your nostagia but actually has decent controls, just play Sonic Generations instead of this.

It's a bad game on its own merits.\n\nThough it certainly is insanely far from a true classic series game. I mean, when every stage in the game is a rehash of a Sonic 1 or 2 zone (and thus entirely unoriginal, something the original series was not) then obviously it's playing off nostalgia fuel. But it doesn't play like those games. It relies on gimmicks instead of level design. Literally every single act barring the first is built around a gimmick. The physics are also all wrong, too; not remotely similar to the classic games, and playing more like the 2D bits of the modern sonic stages in Generations (see the problem there?).\n\nBut I wouldn't care if the game was any good by itself. But... it's not. There's an out of nowhere difficulty spike at the second act of the second zone (and only near the end). Which would matter if you didn't already have 50 lives by that point because the game showers you in them, removing any sense of difficulty. Dying becomes annoying and tedious more than anything. Some of the gimmicks, also, are pretty bad. Mad Gear Act 3's, especially. Since a lot of it requires you to learn where to jump since screwing up once = instant death. Yup. Good job with that one.\n\nAnd let's not get started on the boss design. Well for one every single boss is a carbon copy of a Sonic 1/2 boss, or at least starts out that way. And the newly added bits to the later three are all awful. No, instant-death crusher traps in a sonic boss are not good. No, a sonic advance 2 styled running boss with the occasional impossible to dodge attack is not cool. And no, making Sonic 2's final boss even more tedious and unfair is not cool. Seriously, that thing has broken hitboxes and takes a bloody eternity.\n\nThe game doesn't have particularly good presentation, either. A lot of the graphical elements clash, and the music is the first time I've ever found a sonic soundtrack actively bad. It's just... horrible music. Truly terrible.\n\nThere's... nothing really to recommend here, at all. I didn't expect a great game but I didn't even get a decent one.","August 26, 2014","false","9.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I played this game a whole lot. The gravity is way off, you'll stick to walls while standing horizontal. If you stop holding forward in mid air you will suddenly stop. There is no intertia whatsoever. This includes the classic spindash. The stages are reimagined versions of stages from Sonic the Hedgehog 2. Some of them are pretty cool but many of them are somewhat boring. You only get 4 with 3 acts per stage plus 4bosses, a boss run followed by the final boss.  Being a sonic game it does have a decent replay value but you probably won't want to.\n\nIf you really must know why I'm disappointed, you should take a look at DIMPS other sonic games. Sonic Advance series is very good and the Sonic Rush series is very good. So what the heck happened here? Like seriously? A step backwards. Sonic 4 Episode 2 improves it minimally.

It promised to bring the franchise back to its roots, but it failed.\n\n\nI'm not saying this game is horrible, it just doesn't feel like a traditional (classic) Sonic title.\n\n\nIssues with the game:\n\n- The level designs feel way too linear -\n\nThere are way too many large bottomless pits in stages, boostpads that make you go fast, springs that lead to eachother. It almost makes the game feel like an autoscroller at some points. Many of the level's designs are completely uninspired, they're basically rehashed from the first 2 Sonic Games.\n\n- Splash Hill Zone is your average Green Hill Zone-ish level. This Stage's boss is based off of Green Hill's.\n- Casino Street Zone is basically Casino Night Zone. It almost feels like a carbon copy of the zone from Sonic 2 at some points. Again, this Stage's boss is based off the one seen in Casino Night.\n- Lost Labyrinth is a Labyrinth Zone-ish stage. Nothing much to say here, many of the features from Labyrinth Zone are present here. This stage's boss is based off the one featured in Labyrinth Zone. Noticing a pattern?\n- Mad Gear is basically what would happen if Scrap Yard Zone and Metropolis Zone had a baby, as it feels like both of their level designs have been combined together. Not that its a bad thing. The boss here is based off of Metropolis' boss.\n- E.G.G Station is the final stage in the game. It consists of a boss gauntlet, and then the big bad, recycled straight from Sonic 2. The final boss is Sonic 2's final boss.\n\nThe only thing that makes these bosses different, is that after the fourth hit, they turn into a more powerful version of the original boss. For example, Splash Hill's boss starts flinging the ball towards you.\n\nI was rather disapointed to see that there where no new level themes for Sonic 4: Episode 1. Like, come on Sega, you're calling THIS a sequel to Sonic 3 and Knuckles?\n\nI'll give it that this was only Episode 1, but even Sonic 3 had more level content than this, and that game contained only half of what was planned.\n\n- The Graphics -\n\nNow, this complaint only applies to the PC version. (No, this isn't about Sega not choosing Sonic's classic design).\n\nSonic's model looks way too shiny. I think this issue is a PC exclusive one though, I don't remember it being as shiny when I played the WiiWare release, though I'll have to check that later.\n\n- The Music -\n\nPretty mediocre, especially the soundfont. I know this has been said to death before, but it sounds like a bunch of cats.\n\nNone of the melodies really stuck to me, it just felt way too generic and unoriginal.\n\n\n\n- Stuff I can get behind -\n\nThat aside, just because most of the content in this game is unoriginal, or has been used in previous games doesn't mean this game isn't fun to play.\n\nIf you don't consider it a sequel to Sonic 3 and Knuckles, its a decent (modern) Sonic game by itself. While the physics don't match those of the genesis games, they're by no means bad.\n\nWhile the level design can get tedious at times, it's still enjoyable. Not the best, but it could be worse.  It could be Bubsy\n\nIf you just want a game to play casually, or are just bored, then Sonic 4: Episode 1 is probably a good choice. Otherwise, just play something else.\n\nIf you want to pretend this game never happended, Sonic Retro has tons of rom hacks and fan games that could easily be considered better then this, so check that site out if you want to.\n\n\n\n","March 15","false","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","1"

The game consists of 4 different worlds with 3 stages each and boss battles as always, and also you can collect rings and enter secret stage to try and collect 7 Chaos Emeralds so you can transform yourself into Super Sonic form. While game may be a bit short for like 2-3 hours long it’s still acceptable. The problem with this game is only it’s physics mostly.  Hardcore fans will grab it and newcomers are also welcome.

To me, this game does not cover either of those and that says a lot. This would have to be the third time I have seen a Sonic game screw up.\n\nWhy is it bad?\nLook, I'm not directly saying it is bad because of the plastic graphics and clunky controls. It's the overall Presentation: Enemies from old titles returned and boss fights from Sonic 1 and 2 (not the episodes, I mean the first titles) have also made a return and to be honest, that disapoints me because it's already something I have seen. Where is the new ideas? Oh wait, they saved that for Sonic 4 Ep 2.\nBut that is only just one of my problems. My biggest problem with this game is that you need JAVA to run it in the first place. That's right, you heard me right, you need JAVA to play this game. Now I've had seriously bad expirence with JAVA from the past with adware poping up eveywhere and viruses making their way into the system undetected. Is it worth installing JAVA to play this game?

A Sega character who started off on the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis, this guy has been in games for over 20 years, rescuing small animals from the evil Doctor Robotnik. The original trilogy were a great bunch of games, and still makes Sega plenty of cash through numerous collections, but not all of the games released since then have been so popular, with several considered to be truly bad. More recently, the series has been returning to quality games with Generations and Colors.\n\nStory\nThis game strips away a lot of the clutter that the series has added over the years. Once again, it is just Sonic, Robotnik and a hoard of Badniks (the robots that contain many of the captive animals). Once again Robotnik is causing trouble, and Sonic aims to stop him from taking over.\n\nPresentation\nThe graphics in this game obviously want to get you right in the nostalgia. You will see a lot of stuff you remember from the classic games, only now in a much higher resolution. Level style, enemies, special levels, all are little more than updated versions of classic content. I won't deny that it looks pretty, but it would have been nice to see some more new content during the levels rather than rehashed tiles. A problem I did have was some flickering occurring on the background objects.\n\nSound wise, this starts off with the classic SEGA! intro jingle which I'm sure many fans will remember. And from there, it goes onto mostly forgettable tunes, though some updated classics exist in the soundtrack. The sound effects stick to the classics as well, with everything in the levels making the sounds you would expect.\n\nControls\nPlaying with an XBox 360 controller, I have to say these work well enough. You move with the left analog stick and jump with the A or B button. Later on, you can transform to Super Sonic, which is mapped to the Y button. Other than pausing the game with Start, nothing more is required to play this game. It also has acceptable controls for keyboard, using the arrow keys and Space bar.\n\nGameplay\nEach Zone is remixed from classic levels, with most of them sure to be familiar to long time players of the series. You have Splash Hill in the style of classic Green Hill levels, Casino Street which takes Casino and spring based levels, Lost Labyrinth with the expected ruins and water, and Mad Gear which brings back the mechanical base levels. There is also E.G.G. Station, which consists of a boss run and final boss fight in Robotnik's typical space base, and the Special Stage, which is the seven levels containing the Chaos Emeralds, and based on the special levels from the original game.\n\nEach of the 4 main Zones has 4 Acts with the final Act always having a boss fight against Robotnik. Most of these fights have been taken from previous games, but since each fight is split into two sections where Robotnik tries new tactics, at least you won't be expecting everything.\n\nDespite each Zone having a main theme, most Acts will each have a gimmick to set them apart from other levels in the game. One level will have you running through dark ruins with a burning torch to light your way, another will have you shooting yourself from cannons, a third will have you escaping from a giant cog. This will keep the levels from being too repetitive despite many of the gimmicks being featured in older games.\n\nLifespan\nBeyond the main levels of the game you still have the seven Chaos Emeralds to collect, with all seven unlocking Super Sonic as a playable character, as fans would expect. Within this game, he is playable in the regular levels, a feature that hasn't been part of the series since the original Mega Drive games, with other titles giving him his own special level to complete at the end of the game. There is also a total of 12 achievements to unlock during the game if you are interested in such things.\n\nWhile this game might not be to the same standard as the classic trilogy, it is still a decent game for the series, and worth playing through if you enjoy the Sonic games.","July 30, 2013","true","1.7"," 17 of 41 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","17","41","0","3"

It doesn’t suck like most of the more recent games (looking at you Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric, Black Knight, and Secret Rings >_>), but it doesn’t copy everything from the past Sonic games. It copies a little, with the side scrolling and level theme borrowing. Then they spiced up his classic look and gave him the homing attack which is the best thing they could have done for the 2D Sonic series. Although the game is great, it does have its flaws. One of these flaws is very tight controls. Sonic games usually do have tighter controls of most games but thats because of the speed aspect. But no. in this game you stop on a DIME. This is super annoying and makes you overshoot or undershoot your position. Also the jumping is hit or miss. You move to the exact location of where you moved and stop. It can be good for tricky platforming but other times you just won’t move. Don’t know if this is a legit problem or if it’s because I’m playing with a keyboard on PC but whatever. The level design is amazing. They are fast paced fun and have enough difficulty to make them challenging. The four main areas are Splash Hill, Casino Night, Labyrinth, and Scrap Brain (not actual names except Splash Hill). The bosses are even better. They put a spin on the classic Sonic bosses that the zones were based off of. The controls are a little weird but again, I’m using a keyboard. The last thing besides the story that I am going to talk about is the music and it is definitely is Sonic quality music. It sets the scene and provides an upbeat fast paced tone that matches the level so well. Some of my favorite tracks are from the new Casino Night Zone and the new Labyrinth Zone. The last thing left is the story. This is literally “Oh no! Eggman stole the animals! Time to go save them and keep Eggman from destroying the world.” A modern touch on a classic formula that is sure to please any Sonic fan. I can't wait to buy the second episode.\n\nOverall I give this game a 7.5/10","December 14, 2014","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Scratch that, here's a better remark- I could get a 2CV to speed faster than Sonic!\n\nIn its defence, however, the levels are non-linear, many of the old sounds have been tweaked a bit for higher fidelity and, the in-level baddies actually serve as decent trip-ups as you lumber down the hills like the Giant Boulder of Death.\n\nI like what they tried to achieve but, they would've been better off making it more like the races from Sonic Adventure 2.","December 20, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ricky1487/recommended/202530/","Ricky1487","Ricky Arcana","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ricky1487/","180 products in account","This game had a LOT of potential when it was announced, and I was even excited to try it after I tried the demo. Of course, though, at this time, the Sonic series wasn't doing too hot. I hate to say it, especially since I grew up with the older Sonic games and liked all of them, but Sonic 4 Episode 1 reminds me of why I should look more beyond the demo.\n\n+++Pros+++\nThe only things I can really talk about have catches to them, and that is that Sega cares about their audience and listens to them (the old Genesis games being the prime of Sonic's existence) and this game tries to honor that, and as well, there's a lot of throwback to Sonic 1 & a little bit of Sonic 2.\n\n---Cons---\n-Annoying physics. This is the huge game-breaker for me, and why most of the game isn't as good as it could be. I don't like Sonic immediately stopping on a hill, and when I morph into a ball and roll down the hill, I don't really feel a nice pick up in speed. It's also quite obvious sometimes when you get hit and lose your rings. Sometimes they'll fall right in front of you and you can pick them up, while other times they fly off and frustrate you as you try to hold on to one ring.\n\n-Stupid collision detection. It may not be obvious in the first couple of zones in the game, but in the second half you'll notice it more, especially in the labyrinth zone. You will get hit from a distance and sometimes your attacks on the bosses don't do anything.\n\n-The final boss's execution is horrendous. I didn't like having to be forced to fight the first four forms of Eggman before going to the finale. They could've cut that out and made a "Boss rush" mode out of that. I also hated how it was just a massive endurance fight (you have to hit him like 30 times before you finally beat the game), and the reason I didn't like that is because of the physics and collision detection. Had the physics & collision detection been improved, along with not having to go through the 4 incarnations, I would've enjoyed it. It shouldn't be forgotten that the final boss is practically the final boss of Sonic The Hedgehog 2.\n\n-Throwbacks and references to older games is usually a good thing, a nice refresher while playing a newer game. However, Sonic 4 Episode 1 relies far too much on concepts from Sonic 1 & 2 and it doesn't really go its own path. 2/4 zones are inspired from Sonic 1, and 2/4 zones are from Sonic 2. Also, the bonus stage is essentially from Sonic 1, with an added time limit and ring gates. I feel Sonic 4 should've gone, make its own zones, and then have Sonic 1 & 2 references in those zones.\n\n-Collecting the emeralds ends up being absolutely pointless. There's no showing off Super Sonic in the ending, and you don't even get to fight any bosses with him. You just fly through the levels and get a faster clear time with him.\n\n-Replayability is slim. They have leaderboards where you can aim for best scores/time in each stage, but I didn't feel as compelled to replay the levels.\n\n-Game is short, can beat in maybe 3-4 hours with all the emeralds, MAX. The only reason I have more is because Steam didn't save my save game when I switched PCs. That, or future me went crazy and decided to get the rest of the achievements.\n\n-Price tag. It might just be me, but $10 for 3-4 hours of video game entertainment in this generation is poor quality, especially when the android version is only $3...\n\nDon't spend your money on this game, even on a sale, or if you really want to check out this game, buy the mega hits collection. That way you'll get some great Sonic games too and not feel as jipped.\n\n\n*Note: When I wrote this review, I have not completed Sonic 4 Episode 2, so this review has no bias towards that.","January 2, 2015","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is that Dr. Eggman is at it again, trying to capture little woodland creatures, destroy Sonic and build EggmanLand (originally called Robotropollis/Robotnikland in the US Sega Genesis Sonic games). The graphics are a 2D world with models being in 3D and set from a 2D perspective (a graphic type known as 2.5D) and the music and sounds are great fitting the retro revival with a Sega Genesis sound limitation. The gameplay is the same old Sonic the Hedgehog 2D high speed platforming. Sonic's abilities are the Spin Dash and the Homing Attack, which work responsively. The main complaint is the physics engine, which I will say is bad, but the solution is simple: NEVER LET GO OF THE CONTROLL STICK/D-PAD!!!! The verdict is that this game is a good attempt to bring Sonic back to his 90's Genesis roots, but falls a little short.

For something made to be a sequel to Sonic 3 and Knuckles (or just Sonic the Hedgehog 3, but they were meant to be one game), it really doesn't feel similar. This is the first Sonic game as far as I know to have NO MOVEMENT AFTER YOU LET GO OF A DIRECTION. The caps might have been unnecessary, sure, but seriously, the fact that Sonic keeps moving after you let go of the button has always been a big part of the controls. Without that, it almost doesn't even feel like a Sonic game. It takes getting used to. As of the time I'm writing this I've finished the game with 4 chaos emeralds and it still feels totally wrong to me.\n\nI mentioned the chaos emeralds already, so I'll explain that now. The emeralds are in special stages, which you get to the same way you did in Sonic the Hedgehog. If you have 50 rings or more when you get to the end of a level, a giant floating ring will appear. If you're quick, you can jump in and go to a special stage. The special stages are like the ones in the original as well, except you control the whole level instead of Sonic. You have to rotate the level and let the weird physics do the rest. They're hard, though. Maybe not the first one, but after that they get very challenging, each in its own way. This would be fine if you could unlock each one to play later if you fail, but you have to go all the way through a level where you haven't already got an emerald before you can get another chance. It's stupid, it's frustrating, and it wastes your time. If it was done well, I would totally say the special stage is good replay value, but unfortunately it just isn't this time.\n\nThe music is good and a lot of the sound effects from the Genesis games are reused, for those who care. The graphics look a bit odd--maybe even sloppy, if you don't mind my boldness--but they're not bad and they work. The level design isn't very good in the beginning, and that comes back near the end. A lot of themes from Sonic 1 and 2 were reused here, which is a nice touch for people who played those.\n\nI don't like this nearly as much as the Genesis games and Sonic CD, but it's still decent and I'm looking forward to playing more of Episode 2 (right now I've done the first level and finished Episode Metal). To be honest, I'm slightly relieved to be finished with this game. I have three emeralds left, and I'll go back for them eventually, but for now I think I'll move on to something else.","June 29, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Using the homing attack, instead, gets you at max speed in less than a second without having to charge it. However, using the homing attack as an attack is useless and is often the slowest option to move across an enemy laden screen. The homing attack is also a burden to use when the reticle decides to not track an enemy as long as it occasionally does.\n\nThe physics, oh god... They're terrible and unintuitive and inconsistent. It feels like you're walking through six inches of mud, and you stumble into corners of ledges. Sometimes you don't stay in a ball long enough in the air, which proves problematic when anything aerial is hard to control in the first place and there are enemies you almost hit, but have hit you instead. Sometimes you walk up the wall 30 feet, backwards, with no input, and sometimes you struggle to hop up a small incline. Suffice to say, precision is not this game's strong suit.\n\nThere are miscellaneous strange choices involved in this game's creation, too. Why do acts' title screens look like the Chilean flag? Why does the mouse cursor stay visible in fullscreen mode when there are no mouse controls? Why are pictures of required inputs on menus not replaced with whatever you're really supposed to press, as opposed to the colored rectangles that represent whatever controller's buttons this game originally played with? How does a 2D game have camera issues?\n\nIt's a mediocre port of a cousin of a Sonic game. The art's ok, the music is middling, the character animations are student level, the 3D models are mildly unsettling. It's frustrating and unsatisfying, especially the achievement to beat the final area with no hits taken.

Mainly the last boss. I really enjoyed this game though. I'll definitely play Ep. 2. I didn't feel any spot was so difficult I couldn't progress and the bosses weren't so difficult I felt like giving up. Even though I died a lot on the last boss, I felt like each time I attempted, I learned something new such that I could progress further.\n\nThe graphics were well done, even though I didn't like the cartoony look on Sonic. It didn't look like he fit in with the rest of the environment really. His animation seemed a little "off" when doing a normal walk too, but that didn't detract from the gameplay.\n\nIt's been a while since I've found a game I really enjoyed that I could just pick up and go without a learning curve (which I dread). There was something that I was unfamiliar with, and that was the "homing attack", where you can actually target enemies. It's actually very well thought out and makes the game more enjoyable and interactive. The old sonic games you just went really fast without much control. With the homing attack, as you speedily run through the level, you go faster and further by using the homing attack because it allows sonic to interact with enemies, and objects as you're running.

I feel a bit ripped off in that Sega split Sonic the Hedgehog 4 into two episodes, with only 4 main zones each (well there's the extra episode for Metal Sonic if you buy both Episodes I & II); game physics are not always superb (I kind of got used to it though myself); and probably the thing that bothered me the most about the game is they reused too many of the same boss battles from previous games (with only slight alterations).\n\nOverall I would recommend Episode I (and Episode II for that matter).

The answer is yes, and here's why:'\n\n*EDIT* The listed "7 hours played" is incorrect. I forgot to close the game when I ran errands, and should actually be ~1hr. This included all acts, the final zone boss, and completion of 2 special stages.\n\n-Terrible physics/sense of speed. You are sometimes (often) able to stop halfway up a vertical incline, run up said inclines from a dead stop, coming to a dead stop mid-air if you stop pressing forward, going into the "ball" mode slowing you down, boost pads have a set speed that will slow you down if passing through them.\n-Poorly thought-out level design. One example is the Casino zone has a section where you are required to shoot yourself out of a cannon, onto a field of rotating platforms (which are off-screen and you cannot see) that are constantly changing from being solid to death traps.\n-Clipping/collision issues with enemies/objects. It happens irregularly, but I have had Sonic drop BEHIND the spring-pads, get pushed away from Bosses into the instant-death gimmick of that fight (Hidden Temple boss inparticularly).\n-Unreliable "lock-on" mechanic.\n-Sonic's 'walk to run' animation is about 60% unfinished, and has you walking up until the very last second your "run" turns into a "super run".\n-*EDIT*The special stages are garbage.\n\nOne positive of note (which isn't without problems either):\n+The background & level graphics are higher quality & mesh together better than the 360/PS3 versions, where it was obvious most of the assets are 2d. The background elements of the "Mad Gear" levels are the exception, as much of the fore-ground/interactable objects are indistinguishable from background ones (the gears you run on, for example).\n\nPlay the demo (if there even is one on Steam, I don't actually know) if you actually get the itch to play this.

Especially in terms of the physics and control. As long as you stick to this, you'll find a fairly enjoyable game. It's pretty good, but not truly the real Sonic 4 it could have been. The reasons for this notably boils down to three issues in particular: Use nostalgia, progression, and level design.\n\nFirst off is the appeal of nostalgia, it was unfortunately far too heavily use. With too much borrowing from previous games with the Sonic 1 style bonus stages, and nearly every boss being a rehash with minor tweaks at critical health. The level themes were all very close too in style to previous games, which made it felt more of a reimaging than a sequel.\n\nHand in hand with the nostalgia overload, the game was extremely conservative in the progression department. The bosses as mentioned above were a certainly a major notable case. However, lots of finer details are also affected by this as well. Gone are items introduced in Sonic 2 and 3, leaving only basic ones introduced in Sonic 1… namely just Shields, Power Sneakers, Ring and 1-Up monitors. Although not exactly bad simplifying things to focus on gameplay, it definitely is odd to have the first three progress in complexity and item count to have it go back to square one…\nAlongside this, the game doesn’t really introduce anything new to the series to give it that “Sonic 4” feel. The only new aspect added was the homing attack, which certainly met with mixed reactions. Though it does at least give it that new feel and gives it a progression between the classic series and the modern series putting in the homing attack.\n\nFinally, the level design in the game is often quite questionable at parts. The first level is fantastic, along with the third… but just about every level after these two has quirks with them. Often you’ll find horribly booby trapped, cheap tricks, or heavily gimmicked sections RIGHT before the signpost… which means if you need rings for the bonus stage you can pretty much forget it unless you have the level memorized like the back of your hand. Now that’s not bad to put a challenge for the player right before the exit… but there are good ways to do it and then there are bad ways to do it.\nAnd if the traps before the signpost weren’t enough to keep your mind busy, you’ll likely have noticed how many times you came across cheaply placed enemies that offer not a challenge, but instead only frustration. Jumping on a spring or running through a speed booster shouldn’t result in an immediate collision with an enemy for instance.\nThen we have Mad Gear 3…  certainly an experience.\n\nHowever despite these shortcomings, I still find myself coming back to the game from time to time. It’s enjoyable, and is simple fun like a classic game should be. It has enjoyable graphics (though the shading is a bit of an unusual choice for the characters compared to the scenery), is challenging, and is a lot of fun to be Super Sonic again in a game instead of it being a story element. It may take a little to get used to it initially, but definitely worth a look into if you want a classic game experience.","March 5, 2014","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If so, then why does he go extremely slow in this game? It's like there is no point in doing it.\n\nThere is also a really annoying principal with this game where you have to do the stage within 5 milliseconds or something to simply unlock the next level. I got 3 mins on my first try, 2mins 28 on my next, 1min 51 on my next SERIOUSLY, WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO PLEASE YOU?! I've finished the level in an acceptable time, what more do you want from me? Isn't that what Sonic is about? Anyway, I would do that, IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE HORRIBLE HIT DETECTION! I spent 30 seconds on trying to jump up a hill, I spent a minute trying to jump up another hill.\n\nOverall stats are that I have been playing this game for an hour on the same, first damn level trying to get a target time which isn't displayed to me.\nJust a horrible, horrible game.","June 24, 2014","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can play Sonic 2006 with a bunch of friends and laugh how bad this game is, but Sonic 4 is just boring. Just boring...\nLater in the game you can unlock Super Sonic. It's a little bit more fun because of the higher speed, but then you will jump and try to control and lose all your momentum or just stuck in a looping at 90° or 180°.\nThis game looks a little bit like the old Genesis games (Sonic 1, 2, 3&Knuckles), but don't get fooled, it's completly different.

This has worked to a disadantage however in the sense that it just shows how much this isn't a classic sonic game, sure its 2D and there are a lot of nods to past games (and i mean a lot) but thats as far as it goes.\n\nFor those who are interested i am about to list reasons for this but for those who arent i will just say that it is a reasonable 2D sonic game but it certainly is not worthy of being called sonic the hedgehog 4. It was fun to play up until the last boss which i have been attempting to beat for the past ten minutes or so at the time of writing and still have not managed it. it is a nice nostalgia trip but not a great game in itself merely an ok sonic game and it really varys from peson to person as to whever or not it is what they are looking for.\n\nNow for details\nPositives\n\n. It serves well as a nostalgia trip so for those who are looking for that kind of thing then yes this game has it in spades.\n\n. Fun gameplay for what it is, it is nothing like the old games at all but it is not terrible and yes despite thinking that the game is not worthy to be called Sonic the Hedgehog 4, i still think it is fun\n\n. Super Sonic is available in normal stages and the chaos emeralds can be collected from special stages which i always like to see. Collecting the Emeralds used to be the only reason i played sonic games when i was younger so i shall not complain about that.\n\nNegatives\n\n. The games physics are certainly not like past sonic games and it is most notable in the games speed. by this I mean that there is none, unless you hit a speed boost. this makes the game feel very artificial as whenever you start to move fast you know it is not because of your own actions (i.e. rolling into a ball on a slope like in sonics 1-3) some people may have no problem with this but having played this straight after the classic games it was a notable difference.\n\n. The presentation of the game overall may look nice enough but it certainly has flaws. an example of this could be sonics animations, his slowest running speed is walking pace which makes the game feel incredibly slow as it takes so long for sonic to actually start to run. Also the music is forgettable except for tunes like the supersonic tune and boss battle music as they are so short and on a constant loop that the notes are carved into your very soul.\n\n. There are so many nods to the past games that it really doesnt feel like it is even its own game, all stages are not inspired by previous games but actually feel like they have been taken from previous games and given a makeover, there really is not an original stage in the whole game (original gameplay ideas and puzzles yes but not a lot). this is the same for boss battles as well as they really are just taken from previous games and given new attacks to fight you with. Really not original in the slightest\n\n. Final Point, This is a small nitpick of mine but i feel it is worth noting. the description claims that this game continues the story of the classic games, this really is not true. while the classics where light on story sonic 3 and sonic and knuckles has small scenes scattered throughout the game to give the player and idea of what is happening (like eggman betraying knuckles for the master emerald and knuckles then proceeding to help you) this game has none of that and as a result has no story. so how does it continue from the classic games if it gives the player no idea as to what is actually happening? like i said more of a nitpick but worth noting.\n\nSo my final thoughts are that if it is a nostalgia trip you are looking for or just a short and fun sonic game then yes pick it up. however if you are looking for "Sonic the Hedgehog 4" this is not it, it is nostalgia and no more and really fails to envoke the "style" if you will of the classic games. Sonic 4 episode 2 certainly fixes some issues of this game and i would reccomend that over this.","November 19, 2014","false","8.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/16-bit/recommended/202530/","16-bit","16-Bit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/16-bit/","57 products in account","When you go into the game, go in without expectations and above all, don't keep trying to compare it to the previous three.  Especially in terms of the physics and control. As long as you stick to this, you'll find a fairly enjoyable game. It's pretty good, but not truly the real Sonic 4 it could have been. The reasons for this notably boils down to three issues in particular: Use nostalgia, progression, and level design.\n\nFirst off is the appeal of nostalgia, it was unfortunately far too heavily use. With too much borrowing from previous games with the Sonic 1 style bonus stages, and nearly every boss being a rehash with minor tweaks at critical health. The level themes were all very close too in style to previous games, which made it felt more of a reimaging than a sequel.\n\nHand in hand with the nostalgia overload, the game was extremely conservative in the progression department. The bosses as mentioned above were a certainly a major notable case. However, lots of finer details are also affected by this as well. Gone are items introduced in Sonic 2 and 3, leaving only basic ones introduced in Sonic 1… namely just Shields, Power Sneakers, Ring and 1-Up monitors. Although not exactly bad simplifying things to focus on gameplay, it definitely is odd to have the first three progress in complexity and item count to have it go back to square one…\nAlongside this, the game doesn’t really introduce anything new to the series to give it that “Sonic 4” feel. The only new aspect added was the homing attack, which certainly met with mixed reactions. Though it does at least give it that new feel and gives it a progression between the classic series and the modern series putting in the homing attack.\n\nFinally, the level design in the game is often quite questionable at parts. The first level is fantastic, along with the third… but just about every level after these two has quirks with them. Often you’ll find horribly booby trapped, cheap tricks, or heavily gimmicked sections RIGHT before the signpost… which means if you need rings for the bonus stage you can pretty much forget it unless you have the level memorized like the back of your hand. Now that’s not bad to put a challenge for the player right before the exit… but there are good ways to do it and then there are bad ways to do it.\nAnd if the traps before the signpost weren’t enough to keep your mind busy, you’ll likely have noticed how many times you came across cheaply placed enemies that offer not a challenge, but instead only frustration. Jumping on a spring or running through a speed booster shouldn’t result in an immediate collision with an enemy for instance.\nThen we have Mad Gear 3…  certainly an experience.\n\nHowever despite these shortcomings, I still find myself coming back to the game from time to time. It’s enjoyable, and is simple fun like a classic game should be. It has enjoyable graphics (though the shading is a bit of an unusual choice for the characters compared to the scenery), is challenging, and is a lot of fun to be Super Sonic again in a game instead of it being a story element. It may take a little to get used to it initially, but definitely worth a look into if you want a classic game experience.","March 5, 2014","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the most part, the group does a good job of recapturing the feel of the older games. However, the game suffers from awful and nonsensical physics, as well as stiff, wonky controls even on a gamepad. The music is surprisingly forgettable, save for a few tracks. The level design is unique and expansive, though there are quite a few unfair traps and obstacles, especially in the later levels.\n\nIf you're just doing a regular playthrough of this game, you won't have too much of an issue with the awful physics and controls, and you'll even have a good time with the open-ended levels and unique art style. If you're trying to 100-percent this game...well, you might want to start taking anger-management classes. Recommended for normal playing, NOT recommended for anything other than one and done.\n\nNote: I forgot to mention the homing dash. Gives you a nice little distance, even if the targeting is quirky. It's the one addition to the Sonic formula that I would love to see revisited and expanded upon, as it really helps you regain control of Sonic's momentum.

Sonic has decided to part with Tails and go on a new adventure himself in a new land. In the meantime Dr. Eggman has decided to take out Sonic after enhancing his machines.\n\n• Characters: 7/10\no Sonic and Dr. Eggman return in the game however there arent any new characters or any other returning characters however the enemies have changed dramatically from what they've been in other games and offers a fresh new look and feel to the sonic series.\n\n• GamePlay: 9/10\no Just like any other Sonic game, you go through different zones with different acts and a boss battle at the end. A lot of the familiar features and abilities from past Sonic games have been re-introduced along with the fact that Sonic can now use the homing attack (which was a unique skill in the Adventure series) in the game. The gameplay has a bit more puzzle aspects compared to the other 2D games. Just like any other sonic game you have check point posts where if you die you can come back to rather than starting all over again - you will also be able to collect chaos emeralds to eventually become Super Sonic to reach new heights like the other games.\n\n• Graphics: 10/10\no Sonic the Hedgehog 4 uses a new engine for its visual design. Completely going off the usual 2D 16 bit retro area style - the developers decided to rework the original engine in modern light. The game's far more fluid in motion than any sonic game that has been out. The visual designs are nicely done with everything from the appearance, lighting to the texture. Absolutely one of the most gorgeous looking games to be made with a appealing and colorful tone.\n\n• Sound: 10/10\no Sonic the Hedgehog 4 uses a reworked audio/sound system which brings back a lot of the old tunes from the older games but remakes them with a better bitrate and quality.\n\n• Music: 9/10\no Sonic the Hedgehog 4 uses completely new sound track and offers little to no remixes from the older games (most of which are just the usual themes you would expect such as clearing a act). Despite that fact it still has and uses similar style to the old industrial tech tunes we are so familiar with the older sonic games.\n\n• Length: 5/10\no Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode 1's main fault is the length. Although there are 5 zones with 3 acts each - you can easily finish the game within 2-3 hours. Of course there is time attack to make your records better but that isnt really appealing.\n\n• Replay Value: 7/10\no Despite the fact that the length of the game isnt as much - the level designs are nicely done and offer different paths like the older games. You also have the option to play the special stages again which you have completed. You also have the option to directly fight a boss of a zone rather than going through a set of acts before having a chance to fight them.\n\n• Player Value: 9/10\no Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode is an amazing sequel with what they've done adding a Sonic in a colorful and vivid world, amazing fluid visuals, a upbeat Soundtrack, and amazing re-telling of Sonic's fight against Dr. Eggman. However despite that it still has its faults such as the fact that the game's length is a bit of a lowside and the lack of some key Sonic characters missing out. Regardless this game is still a nice addition to the hardcore Sonic fan and any fan of the platformer/adventure genre.","December 30, 2013","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a bit of a mixed bag. But overall it's alright. Let me elaborate:\n\nThe game's story is pretty much classic, Eggman's an ♥♥♥ and turns animals into robots, so I'm not really gonna talk about it.\nThe gameplay is your standard Sonic. A 2D platformer where you run fast and jump on enemies. But there's something else going on here. Sonic, for one, has his homing attack and spindash, where he didn't in Sonic 1. But it's the physics that are a bit off. Sonic stops in mid jump if you let go of the stick, and he randomly uncurls from his spindash and jumps. It's a bit annoying, but I never really found it a hinderance.\n\nThe graphics are eh. Sonic, the enemies and Eggman are all in 3D, almost cel-shaded models, while the backgrounds and such are 2D. Honestly it looks okay, but it's not Sonic Generations. The graphics aren't really a major concern in Sonic games.\n\nAnd now the music. UH. WTF. Seriously, I don't get what they were thinking here. I guess it must have been attempting to replicate the music and sound system of that of the Genesis/Megadrive, but it sounds really weird and off, despite there actually being some memorable tunes in there.\n\nHuh. I can't really say much else about this game. It is a flawed gem. A flawed, cracked, ground up gem. But I guess I would reccomend it, since it was the first game to be good since the dark ages of Sonic Heroes through Sonic Unleashed, but it was Sonic Colors that brought us out, not this.","December 30, 2013","true","8.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Normally, that would be okay, especially since the entire game is based off of the first three Sonic games, however Sonic 2 had the worst Special Stages out of the three, imo.\n> Almost unpredictable bosses that spontaneously switch attack patterns causing you to die much more times than neccessary for your first playthrough.\n> The final boss is probably THE most frustratingly tedious and repetitive thing in the entire franchise, let alone the game itself.\n\nVisuals\nI don't usually like to judge a game for it's graphical qualities so it doesn't really factor in my opinion, but I'd like to just point it out incase you might.\n> Character models are super bloomed and look like plastic.\n> Foreground scenery and on-stage objects look like cardboard, with the exception of the waterfalls in Splash Hill Zone...\n\nThat all being said, I think the only redeemable factor in this game is that the music, although not the best, definitely fits with what the game is trying to be.","January 3, 2014","false","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For something made to be a sequel to Sonic 3 and Knuckles (or just Sonic the Hedgehog 3, but they were meant to be one game), it really doesn't feel similar. This is the first Sonic game as far as I know to have NO MOVEMENT AFTER YOU LET GO OF A DIRECTION. The caps might have been unnecessary, sure, but seriously, the fact that Sonic keeps moving after you let go of the button has always been a big part of the controls. Without that, it almost doesn't even feel like a Sonic game. It takes getting used to. As of the time I'm writing this I've finished the game with 4 chaos emeralds and it still feels totally wrong to me.\n\nI mentioned the chaos emeralds already, so I'll explain that now. The emeralds are in special stages, which you get to the same way you did in Sonic the Hedgehog. If you have 50 rings or more when you get to the end of a level, a giant floating ring will appear. If you're quick, you can jump in and go to a special stage. The special stages are like the ones in the original as well, except you control the whole level instead of Sonic. You have to rotate the level and let the weird physics do the rest. They're hard, though. Maybe not the first one, but after that they get very challenging, each in its own way. This would be fine if you could unlock each one to play later if you fail, but you have to go all the way through a level where you haven't already got an emerald before you can get another chance. It's stupid, it's frustrating, and it wastes your time. If it was done well, I would totally say the special stage is good replay value, but unfortunately it just isn't this time.\n\nThe music is good and a lot of the sound effects from the Genesis games are reused, for those who care. The graphics look a bit odd--maybe even sloppy, if you don't mind my boldness--but they're not bad and they work. The level design isn't very good in the beginning, and that comes back near the end. A lot of themes from Sonic 1 and 2 were reused here, which is a nice touch for people who played those.\n\nI don't like this nearly as much as the Genesis games and Sonic CD, but it's still decent and I'm looking forward to playing more of Episode 2 (right now I've done the first level and finished Episode Metal). To be honest, I'm slightly relieved to be finished with this game. I have three emeralds left, and I'll go back for them eventually, but for now I think I'll move on to something else.","June 29, 2014","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But overall, SONIC 4: EPISODE I is a good game.\n\nThe game hasn't got much story, but then again neither did the original games. Each zone is made up of three acts and a boss. Nothing special there. The levels themselves are pretty much 3D rendered remakes of original Sonic levels, such as Green Hill, Casino Night and Metropolis. Nothing too special there either.

I still enjoy 3D, but most of the time they are just too boxed up, with not enough room to move. 2D levels, however, offer more paths to be placed in a smaller area, allowing exploration to become a bigger component in this game.\n\nFinal Verdict:\n\nA great little case of faint nostalgia at a relatively cheap price. Definitely worth the money!\n7/10","June 26, 2014","true","20.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a very nice-looking game and the music is superb, but that's where the compliments finish I'm afraid.\n\nWhen I first heard about this game's development I was understandably excited. Like many, I grew up with Sonic and his adventures on the Mega Drive. So an old-style 2D Sonic game with modern graphics sounded just the ticket. This does not feel like an old-style Sonic game. It feels like a less-than-average platformer that would've been only slightly impressive back in the 16-bit era. The physics are appaling for a Sonic title. Any kind of momentum you might build up, whether on land or in air, is lost the instant you release the direction button; kind of strange for the fastest mascot in the world.\n\nIt makes me wonder who exactly tested this game and if they ever even played any of the original 2D titles. It amazes me that somebody actually thought, "okay, this game is finished and plays perfectly, we can't improve on this in any way." Well, they were wrong.\n\nFor newcomers, this is a pretty average side-scrolling 2.5D platformer and you will probably get some enjoyment from it, if you can tolerate the physics. For those trying to find some nostalgia, you will find it most definitely in the soundtrack and the level design, but most definitely not from the handling.\n\nIt's novel, if nothing else. Episode II is far, far better with its nicer visuals, slightly more original soundtrack, creative level design and, most importantly, a gameplay style closer to that classic mid-90s Sonic feel than anything within the last 15 years, easily. Buy that instead.","March 26, 2014","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It doesn’t suck like most of the more recent games (looking at you Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric, Black Knight, and Secret Rings >_>), but it doesn’t copy everything from the past Sonic games. It copies a little, with the side scrolling and level theme borrowing. Then they spiced up his classic look and gave him the homing attack which is the best thing they could have done for the 2D Sonic series. Although the game is great, it does have its flaws. One of these flaws is very tight controls. Sonic games usually do have tighter controls of most games but thats because of the speed aspect. But no. in this game you stop on a DIME. This is super annoying and makes you overshoot or undershoot your position. Also the jumping is hit or miss. You move to the exact location of where you moved and stop. It can be good for tricky platforming but other times you just won’t move. Don’t know if this is a legit problem or if it’s because I’m playing with a keyboard on PC but whatever. The level design is amazing. They are fast paced fun and have enough difficulty to make them challenging. The four main areas are Splash Hill, Casino Night, Labyrinth, and Scrap Brain (not actual names except Splash Hill). The bosses are even better. They put a spin on the classic Sonic bosses that the zones were based off of. The controls are a little weird but again, I’m using a keyboard. The last thing besides the story that I am going to talk about is the music and it is definitely is Sonic quality music. It sets the scene and provides an upbeat fast paced tone that matches the level so well. Some of my favorite tracks are from the new Casino Night Zone and the new Labyrinth Zone. The last thing left is the story. This is literally “Oh no! Eggman stole the animals! Time to go save them and keep Eggman from destroying the world.” A modern touch on a classic formula that is sure to please any Sonic fan. I can't wait to buy the second episode.\n\nOverall I give this game a 7.5/10","December 14, 2014","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This really just isn't an enjoyable or interesting game.\n\nThe levels feel like an uninspired, inferior, re-tread of the original game (which I hadn't played in years). There are many hidden traps that are impossible to avoid unless you already know the levels and it doesn't in any way encourage you to build up speed, particularly in levels where the entire screen is dark except a small area around Sonic which are just frustrating.\n\nThe game itself feels slow. Despite the fact that the whole selling point of Sonic is his speed, his plodding acceleration in this makes it feel significantly slower than other platformers like Mario or Super Meat Boy.\n\nThere is still an annoying "life" system, even though this hasn't been relevant in any game outside of an arcade ever.\n\nThe graphics are not good. Sonic is a weird sort of cell shaded 3D that clashes horribly with the backdrops and enemies. If this came out on PS2 or from a one-person indie developer I would have complained about it looking bad. Considering it came out in the HD generation and is the flagship franchise of one of the biggest game studios in the world there's no excuse for this.\n\nI eventually gave up at a Robotnik boss fight that made you go through an entire level every time you failed it.

I have loved the Sonic franchise since I first learnt to actually control anything way back in the Mega Drive era, so the fact the Sonic team decided to continue on from those days was something I had to get in on! But we all know that the Sonic Team of recent years have let us down more times than they've given us anything wonderful. This game somehow lives in between the two.\n\nThe visuals, the style, it all harks back to the good old days, and it is wonderfully vibrant. Controlling Sonic though, it's not anywhere near as smooth as it was back then. Sonic feels jerky, and can feel like he has no momentum, though there are times when you manage not to notice this! I think they have hoped this lack of smooth control is made up for by using modern Sonic's new ability to make this sort of homing attack, somewhat negating the need for precise control. This being said, they seem to have enjoyed creating puzzle sections within a couple of the levels, requiring much more control than the game gives.\n\nSo much is in this game that should make it great, and nostalgic, and all that. And it sort of achieves this, sometimes. But it doesn't do it well. I want to love it, but the level designs are mostly either lazy or just plain poor. The real work seems to have gone into half cloning a few parts of levels from the 90s to make it familiar, which I find quite absurd considering this is Sonic 4. At no point in Sonic 3 did any of us go "Ah yes, remember this bit from Sonic 1?" It should be a continuation, bringing it into the modern world, but these attempted "homages" only serve to make you notice all the things they've changed about the way the game works, and how you don't like it in this setting.\n\nI'd recommend it I think, because it still has something there, something you can enjoy, but don't expect to get that feeling back, for some reason, although the game is following on from 3, they seem to have targeted it at the kids who would never have touched any form of Sega console and think they have only ever made games for Nintendo.","May 27, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/202530/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Sonic The Heghehog 4 - Episode 1 is a 2D platformer that came out in 2010, later came to Steam in 2012, and is a direct continuation of main trilogy of Sonic games. Sonic 4 project was supposed to have few episode-games, but it only ever reached two. It also should be noted that smartphone versions of this episode have some differences in it, mostly some of gameplay in some levels being different. More carts in mines, I heard.\n\nThough, it doesn't have enough of resolutions. You may want to play in windowed mode so it will not look ugly.\n\nBeing episode means that it's not a big game. You got world map where you can select one of the four main zones, each boasting 3 acts, each one using different new gimmick, plus serapate boss act. Plus final level. And plus seven special stages. Actually, if you cound all acts together, it's quite a decent lenght, not much shorter than what Sonic 1 was.\n\nAnd you know, when the game came out, the critizm was quite extreme. Fans were pushing, kicking and tearing apart Sonic 4 so hard, I actually started to belive that this game is a massive failure. Those videos that showcase inferior physics of main character were quite proving the point. The one where Sonic was standing on the vertical-part of a curve and refused to fall off. They also kept critizing the fact that it had Homing Attack move, the one where you home/zero at the enemy in front of you when you are in air.\n\nAnd with my very very low negative expectation, I was blown away that this game doesn't suck. It's true that the physics don't work as good as old title, think of Sonic Rush without boost. It doesn't have same rolling physics for sure, so it's more about running and jumping. And yes, the second zone, casino night, with all the pinball bumpers, was showing a weaker side of a game. But as I kept playing, I saw that level design was real nice. It still had few paths you can take. It still wasn't just "run and never jump". It even was introducing new gimmicks each act, like being underwater or getting into cannons that shoot you out, making each act more unique and showing that this game wasn't as lazy job as I was expecting it to be.\nAnd the biggest highlight of it was the second act of Labyrinth zone, which had darkness, Sonic holding light, switches, carts and even usual timed puzzle that platforming genre tend to have. That act is really unique and felt awesome, bringing something fresh to Sonic formula, that even fans themselves beated up badly. Shame that some of Sonic fans didn't play enough of other platformers to be able to figure otu that puzzle and were just complaining about speed and physics, disregarding level design and platforming. The first Sonic wasn't as fast as later ones and that is my favourite.\nThat, and homing attack is nice there too, with lines of enemies being placed in such way that you can access higher areas if you make use of this mechanics.\n\nBut it still quite a weak title, it feels like it didn't want to go too epic, was constraining itself. For example, bosses. They are like the classic Sonic 1 bosses, just eggman taking his time while doing something simple. With a twists. But it still feels on really simple side. At least they were combined in final level for boss rush and then final boss didn't dissapoint. This final boss is going to give you hard time like in all old platformers, killing you until you learn and master all the required tactics and then take him down.\n\nThen again, difficulty is uneven. For most of parts game is easy, with harder parts here and there. And final boss. Though, diffculty does grow slightly as you progress in levels.But my main complaint is lives system. Which is only needed so you wouldn't restart stages from scratch. The thing is, game showers you with lives. You get lives for 100 rings. Then you get life if you finish act with around 100 rings or so, as you will get huge score. And then the second act of second zone throws so many at you at once. Let's say, if in the videogames universe there was market for lives, this game would have make it collapse due to huge inflation.\n\nYou also can collect 7 emeralds. They change ending slightly, teasing with what was coming for Episode 2, and they also allows you to transform into Super Sonic. At least, thankfully, transformation is placed on serapate button this time around, so you don't have to worry about accidently transforming into him if you don't like it.\nSpecial Stages are a twist on Sonic 1 formula. You still find Sonic rolling in a maze. But this time around, you control the rotation of maze itself. It was quite hard, but interesting. Much better than Special Stages in Sonic 1 for sure, with additional elements to it too.\n\nGraphics are your usual 2.5D deal. Background are 2D, objects are 3D. They do have simplistic shading that puts many away, but it's fine.\nMusic, on other hand, is less fine. I can like it for what it is, but if you think of it as trying to emulate music in original Sonic titles, then it comes off as a stereotype, carricature. It's not pretty, abuses same drums and has repetitive tracks. Especially one boss music, which is only few-seconds long or so. I still like them, some even have tense mood that originals tended not to have, but quality is not on the same level.\n\nAnd that said, physics still do get in the way. Mostly, when you need precise platforming. You have to get used to Sonic stopping suddenly when you release buttons. Being like a tank. On two legs. And jumping one. Yea, Homing Attacks help. And yea, less momentum based, as rolling off the slope still slows you down, like in most modern 2D Sonics. But eh. Still fine platformer.\nThough, there is some cheap enemy placement. Like, in darkness level, the first enemy you encounter pops out in front of you, giving a bad impression for whole level, being afraid of other cheap placement. But it's quite rare, actually. That, and rings system of health in Sonic games always made it feel that it's alright to get hit occasionally.\n\nI am not really sure that I can recommend to those who aren't into Sonic. And even then, only those Sonic fans who aren't just there for speed may enjoy this one. It doesn't even feel like proper trilogy continuation, there is no plot or throwback to past events. You just kick Eggman for no reason.\nPerhaps I liked it because I had very low expectations. Was expecting a bad game. Horrible one. And I sure can see why people would have made it sound like it, as it was hyped a lot, as continuation to everybody's beloved trilogy.\n\nThink of it as, let's say, Sonic 2D spinoff that would be developed exclusively for smartphone. Yes. Something like that. It's pretty cool this way.","June 12, 2015","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sometimes during the game you can actually stick onto hills and stand there instead of fall off, but these glitches usually don't happen very often if you're running through the level.\n\nSonic 4 Episode I also reuses the same concepts for levels that have been done in previous classic Sonic games. Splash Hill Zone is just Green Hill Zone from Sonic 1, Casino Street Zone is just Casino Night Zone from Sonic 2, Lost Labyrinth Zone is just Labyrinth Zone from Sonic 1, and Mad Gear Zone is just Metropolis Zone from Sonic 2, E.G.G Station Zone is just Death Egg Zone from Sonic 2. Not only does this game reuse levels, it reuses the same enemies and doesn't add any new ones or new ideas and concepts to the old ones. Most bosses are also the same bosses from the previous games, but they do add a new second phase to each boss. For some reason, Sonic's shading just looks odd, it looks like someone turned the contrast up on Sonic's textures too much and now it's light blue. It's pretty strange since it seems like only the PC and Xbox 360 versions are like this and the graphics in any other versions of the game aren't like this. The music in this game would be good if it weren't for the bad synths they used for the music. I think they were trying to emulate the sounds of a Sega Genesis, but massively failed. The synths sound almost like dying cats and because of that, it does lower the quality of the music.\n\nThe fact that this game is called “Sonic 4 Episode I” annoys me because this game just doesn't feel like an actual Sonic 4, because of the physics and the rehashing of levels in previous Sonic games. If you're expecting a full sequel to the original Sonic trilogy, you will be disappointed. But, if you aren't expecting a full sequel to the trilogy and want to take the risk of buying this mediocre game, then buy it.","March 16, 2015","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Using the homing attack, instead, gets you at max speed in less than a second without having to charge it. However, using the homing attack as an attack is useless and is often the slowest option to move across an enemy laden screen. The homing attack is also a burden to use when the reticle decides to not track an enemy as long as it occasionally does.\n\nThe physics, oh god... They're terrible and unintuitive and inconsistent. It feels like you're walking through six inches of mud, and you stumble into corners of ledges. Sometimes you don't stay in a ball long enough in the air, which proves problematic when anything aerial is hard to control in the first place and there are enemies you almost hit, but have hit you instead. Sometimes you walk up the wall 30 feet, backwards, with no input, and sometimes you struggle to hop up a small incline. Suffice to say, precision is not this game's strong suit.\n\nThere are miscellaneous strange choices involved in this game's creation, too. Why do acts' title screens look like the Chilean flag? Why does the mouse cursor stay visible in fullscreen mode when there are no mouse controls? Why are pictures of required inputs on menus not replaced with whatever you're really supposed to press, as opposed to the colored rectangles that represent whatever controller's buttons this game originally played with? How does a 2D game have camera issues?\n\nIt's a mediocre port of a cousin of a Sonic game. The art's ok, the music is middling, the character animations are student level, the 3D models are mildly unsettling.

Of course, though, at this time, the Sonic series wasn't doing too hot. I hate to say it, especially since I grew up with the older Sonic games and liked all of them, but Sonic 4 Episode 1 reminds me of why I should look more beyond the demo.\n\n+++Pros+++\nThe only things I can really talk about have catches to them, and that is that Sega cares about their audience and listens to them (the old Genesis games being the prime of Sonic's existence) and this game tries to honor that, and as well, there's a lot of throwback to Sonic 1 & a little bit of Sonic 2.\n\n---Cons---\n-Annoying physics. This is the huge game-breaker for me, and why most of the game isn't as good as it could be. I don't like Sonic immediately stopping on a hill, and when I morph into a ball and roll down the hill, I don't really feel a nice pick up in speed. It's also quite obvious sometimes when you get hit and lose your rings. Sometimes they'll fall right in front of you and you can pick them up, while other times they fly off and frustrate you as you try to hold on to one ring.\n\n-Stupid collision detection. It may not be obvious in the first couple of zones in the game, but in the second half you'll notice it more, especially in the labyrinth zone. You will get hit from a distance and sometimes your attacks on the bosses don't do anything.\n\n-The final boss's execution is horrendous. I didn't like having to be forced to fight the first four forms of Eggman before going to the finale. They could've cut that out and made a "Boss rush" mode out of that. I also hated how it was just a massive endurance fight (you have to hit him like 30 times before you finally beat the game), and the reason I didn't like that is because of the physics and collision detection. Had the physics & collision detection been improved, along with not having to go through the 4 incarnations, I would've enjoyed it. It shouldn't be forgotten that the final boss is practically the final boss of Sonic The Hedgehog 2.\n\n-Throwbacks and references to older games is usually a good thing, a nice refresher while playing a newer game. However, Sonic 4 Episode 1 relies far too much on concepts from Sonic 1 & 2 and it doesn't really go its own path. 2/4 zones are inspired from Sonic 1, and 2/4 zones are from Sonic 2. Also, the bonus stage is essentially from Sonic 1, with an added time limit and ring gates. I feel Sonic 4 should've gone, make its own zones, and then have Sonic 1 & 2 references in those zones.\n\n-Collecting the emeralds ends up being absolutely pointless. There's no showing off Super Sonic in the ending, and you don't even get to fight any bosses with him. You just fly through the levels and get a faster clear time with him.\n\n-Replayability is slim. They have leaderboards where you can aim for best scores/time in each stage, but I didn't feel as compelled to replay the levels.\n\n-Game is short, can beat in maybe 3-4 hours with all the emeralds, MAX. The only reason I have more is because Steam didn't save my save game when I switched PCs. That, or future me went crazy and decided to get the rest of the achievements.\n\n-Price tag. It might just be me, but $10 for 3-4 hours of video game entertainment in this generation is poor quality, especially when the android version is only $3...\n\nDon't spend your money on this game, even on a sale, or if you really want to check out this game, buy the mega hits collection. That way you'll get some great Sonic games too and not feel as jipped.\n\n\n*Note: When I wrote this review, I have not completed Sonic 4 Episode 2, so this review has no bias towards that.","January 2, 2015","false","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However, the final product comes across as lazy and rushed. The game doesn't have an original bone in it's body. All of the levels and 4 out of the 5 bosses are near copy-paste jobs from Sonic 1 and 2. The games artwork isn't at 1080 resolution, so setting the game at a lower native resolution actually makes it look better. The sound effects are also taken from previous games, and the music mimics a Sega Genesis vibe, which doesn't really match the revamped "HD" look of the game.\n\nBut the biggest problem is the games utterly floored momentum physics, whether your running, jumping or rolling, if you stop holding the direction you're traveling, you will stop. This sets up the awkward situation where the player either needs to lock themselves at a full speed run, or stop completely. There is no middle ground. It also makes platforming more difficult than it needs to be.\n\nIf you are looking for a Sonic experience on the PC, this game would have to rank near the very bottom of the list. It's not a BAD game per se, but it is extremely average.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/16-bit/recommended/202530/","16-bit","16-Bit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/16-bit/","57 products in account","When you go into the game, go in without expectations and above all, don't keep trying to compare it to the previous three.  Especially in terms of the physics and control. As long as you stick to this, you'll find a fairly enjoyable game. It's pretty good, but not truly the real Sonic 4 it could have been. The reasons for this notably boils down to three issues in particular: Use nostalgia, progression, and level design.\n\nFirst off is the appeal of nostalgia, it was unfortunately far too heavily use. With too much borrowing from previous games with the Sonic 1 style bonus stages, and nearly every boss being a rehash with minor tweaks at critical health. The level themes were all very close too in style to previous games, which made it felt more of a reimaging than a sequel.\n\nHand in hand with the nostalgia overload, the game was extremely conservative in the progression department. The bosses as mentioned above were a certainly a major notable case. However, lots of finer details are also affected by this as well. Gone are items introduced in Sonic 2 and 3, leaving only basic ones introduced in Sonic 1… namely just Shields, Power Sneakers, Ring and 1-Up monitors. Although not exactly bad simplifying things to focus on gameplay, it definitely is odd to have the first three progress in complexity and item count to have it go back to square one…\nAlongside this, the game doesn’t really introduce anything new to the series to give it that “Sonic 4” feel. The only new aspect added was the homing attack, which certainly met with mixed reactions. Though it does at least give it that new feel and gives it a progression between the classic series and the modern series putting in the homing attack.\n\nFinally, the level design in the game is often quite questionable at parts. The first level is fantastic, along with the third… but just about every level after these two has quirks with them. Often you’ll find horribly booby trapped, cheap tricks, or heavily gimmicked sections RIGHT before the signpost… which means if you need rings for the bonus stage you can pretty much forget it unless you have the level memorized like the back of your hand. Now that’s not bad to put a challenge for the player right before the exit… but there are good ways to do it and then there are bad ways to do it.\nAnd if the traps before the signpost weren’t enough to keep your mind busy, you’ll likely have noticed how many times you came across cheaply placed enemies that offer not a challenge, but instead only frustration. Jumping on a spring or running through a speed booster shouldn’t result in an immediate collision with an enemy for instance.\nThen we have Mad Gear 3…  certainly an experience.\n\nHowever despite these shortcomings, I still find myself coming back to the game from time to time. It’s enjoyable, and is simple fun like a classic game should be. It has enjoyable graphics (though the shading is a bit of an unusual choice for the characters compared to the scenery), is challenging, and is a lot of fun to be Super Sonic again in a game instead of it being a story element. It may take a little to get used to it initially, but definitely worth a look into if you want a classic game experience.","March 5, 2014","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is an utter miserable pile of dump. It shouldn't be considered the 4th entry in the legendary Sonic 1,2,3&K series.\n\nWhy is this game terrible?\n\nThe graphics. Sega. What is wrong with 16 bit? Why didn't you follow in Capcom's footsteps and give Sonic the Megaman 9 nad 10 treatment? The graphics are so bland. It'd have been 100% better if the game was faithful to it's older Genesis series. The resolution is much too zoomed into sonic, too. The Genesis graphics in sonic 123 were beautiful and awe inspiring! This game includes ♥♥♥♥♥♥ rehashes of old Sonic levels, and not done well at that.\n\nThe music. You can tell it was inspired by the older games, and you can hear them trying to work the Genesis' gritty soundchip into the game. But it falls flat on it's face. It's possible to emulate a Genesis soundchip on something that isn't a Genesis, and it can be done very well, too. Sonic 4 Ep 1 fails to deliver any memorable music at all. Each act has it's own variation, I'll give them credit for not being lazy in that aspect, but it still doesn't sound catchy, or even good. The soundtrack is a shame to it's predecesors.\n\nThe control is halfway decent, and it feels clunky at times. The level design is literally just ripped from older 2D Sonic games but warped in such a way that makes the game slow paced and not fun to play. New gimmicks are introduced but they feel very...well, gimmicky. It doesn't detract from the game's miserable level design, it's just thrown into the mix because Sega thinks we won't notice The game isn't even challenging, by the Casino Zone Act 3, I had about 30 lives extra lives thrown at me like candy on halloween. The game being episodic is also stupid. Episode 2 is better, but it's not by much.\n\nDon't buy this terrible game. Instead, go cleanse yourself with the Genesis versions. Or if you are looking for a newer Sonic game that is actually amazing, check out Sonic Generations.\n\nWhat is GOOD about this game?\n\nIt's better than Sonic 06. That is about it.","February 17, 2014","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a very nice-looking game and the music is superb, but that's where the compliments finish I'm afraid.\n\nWhen I first heard about this game's development I was understandably excited. Like many, I grew up with Sonic and his adventures on the Mega Drive. So an old-style 2D Sonic game with modern graphics sounded just the ticket. This does not feel like an old-style Sonic game. It feels like a less-than-average platformer that would've been only slightly impressive back in the 16-bit era. The physics are appaling for a Sonic title. Any kind of momentum you might build up, whether on land or in air, is lost the instant you release the direction button; kind of strange for the fastest mascot in the world.\n\nIt makes me wonder who exactly tested this game and if they ever even played any of the original 2D titles. It amazes me that somebody actually thought, "okay, this game is finished and plays perfectly, we can't improve on this in any way." Well, they were wrong.\n\nFor newcomers, this is a pretty average side-scrolling 2.5D platformer and you will probably get some enjoyment from it, if you can tolerate the physics. For those trying to find some nostalgia, you will find it most definitely in the soundtrack and the level design, but most definitely not from the handling.\n\nIt's novel, if nothing else. Episode II is far, far better with its nicer visuals, slightly more original soundtrack, creative level design and, most importantly, a gameplay style closer to that classic mid-90s Sonic feel than anything within the last 15 years, easily. Buy that instead.","March 26, 2014","false","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's difficult to know where to start with this review. Although I would recommend this game based on the slightly above mediocre graphics I also don't recommend the game based on it's gameplay. It's definately a spiced up remake of the classic Sonic games from the Sega Mega Drive Classics - the Sonic games which I used to play on the old Sega Genesis console as a kid - but it's no where near as fun nor easy to control, instead you find some of the levels annoyingly frustrating and often get stuck because the worlds are now build in 3D graphics.\n\nAlthough it was a great concept and cool design I felt as though this game needed more work. I'm only giving it a good review because I did get it when it was on a super sale so I at least didn't waste too much money on it.\n\n5/10","March 9","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Those purists who'd have you believe that because it doesn't rank up to the classic of yesterday but sorry, guys. It does.\n\nI haven't played a NEW Sonic Game since Dreamcast first hit the market over a decade ago.... and even then it was just the demo at the Blockbuster but the transition to 3D threw me off and apparently led the series downhill.\n\nThis is exactly what a Sonic game is. It's light hearted fast paced platformer and though the sound track isn't anything compared to the classics, it still has a bit of that nostalgiac charm that harkens back to childhood yester years. Honestly. I know I had the stupidest grin on my face for the 30 minutes I just played.\n\nMy one qualm I have about this game is the controls do feel a bit clunky at certain times and it might be a learning curve.\n\nAside from that, I would recommend this to Sonic lovers, platform enthusiasts, Motorheads (the term means speedfreak :P) and to parents looking to pass the torch from one generation.

Nearly nothing is right, the speed, level design/features, controls, physics, bosses and more.

You can play Sonic 2006 with a bunch of friends and laugh how bad this game is, but Sonic 4 is just boring. Just boring...\nLater in the game you can unlock Super Sonic. It's a little bit more fun because of the higher speed, but then you will jump and try to control and lose all your momentum or just stuck in a looping at 90° or 180°.\nThis game looks a little bit like the old Genesis games (Sonic 1, 2, 3&Knuckles), but don't get fooled, it's completly different. Do you remember the horrible (sometimes hard) special zones in Sonic 1? Well in this game the special zones are similar, BUT now you control the stage and not Sonic. It's just... bla.

Exactly how everything should look, and how the Sonic team would have made it look in 1991 if they could. It's too bad that the picture is too zoomed in for the player to take in all the wonderful polygons. Or plan, or see where they're going.\n\nSound: it's OK in a generic sort of way. It sounds like a TV show showing game footage that's obviously supposed to be Sonic but has been changed enough to avoid copyright infringement concerns. The Sonic 1 feel is there, but the tunes fall flat.\n\nMechanics: Sonic loses momentum immediately whenever you stop pressing the D-Pad. This change from the Genesis games results in jerky motion with no flow, and is the primary reason I had to quit playing. The perfectly fluid, intuitive physics of Sonic 1-3 has been replaced with something that defeats the point of Sonic's concept.\n\nI was going to buy Sonic Generations but went with this because it was cheaper and I assumed it would play basically the same.

Also don't expect to go too fast in this game.\n\n7.7/10","January 18","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Those purists who'd have you believe that because it doesn't rank up to the classic of yesterday but sorry, guys. It does.\n\nI haven't played a NEW Sonic Game since Dreamcast first hit the market over a decade ago.... and even then it was just the demo at the Blockbuster but the transition to 3D threw me off and apparently led the series downhill.\n\nThis is exactly what a Sonic game is. It's light hearted fast paced platformer and though the sound track isn't anything compared to the classics, it still has a bit of that nostalgiac charm that harkens back to childhood yester years. Honestly. I know I had the stupidest grin on my face for the 30 minutes I just played.\n\nMy one qualm I have about this game is the controls do feel a bit clunky at certain times and it might be a learning curve.\n\nAside from that, I would recommend this to Sonic lovers, platform enthusiasts, Motorheads (the term means speedfreak :P) and to parents looking to pass the torch from one generation. Honestly, on that last part, I can't wait to show this game to my niece.\n\nCheers!","March 11","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're close minded and really only care for the first 3 sonics, stick with them.\nIf you're willing to give the game a chance despite it having all of 2 problems, then i'd say get it on a sale. 4.99 is a good price i'd say. $9.99 is pushing it.

Episode 1. Yeah the Sonic 4 saga is episodic, not my idea. Well its not like there were that many.... at all. But anyway lets press on\n\nWell lets cover the story: Dr. Eggman is once again up to no good and wants to take over the world and sonic won't have that. Thats it, very pretty much the entire plot so onto the gameplay!\n\nSo sonic has now gone back to his 2D roots in this game as he speeds through NOT-Green Hill Zone (Splash Hill Zone), NOT-Casino Night Zone (Casino Street Zone), NOT-Labyrinth Zone (Lost Labyrinth Zone) and NOT- Scrap Brain/Metropolis Zone (Mad Gear Zone). While the level themes my be reused the level design is all original like Splash Hill has vines to swing on, Casino street has card and cannons, Lost Labyrinth has minecart and the wonderful torch puzzle and Mad Gear has gears, gears and more gears... The Bosses are all previous creations like the swing ball eggman and the... Death egg Robot that by the way takes place in NOT-Death Egg Zone (E.G.G Station Zone). Well Sonic himself sports his modern design and can still jump on enemies, do nthe spin dash and do the homing at.. wait sonic doesn't homing attack in the classics. Yeah, they added in the homing attack witch means there will be the usual chain of enemies, (theres plenty of them as well). The homing attack just feels unnessisary at times,, did we really need it? Another thing that bothers me is that sonic just feels weightless at times. With just a little speed you can scale up a cliff no problem at all and when t=you let go off the d-pad sonic stops almost dead in his tracks like hes got magnets on the bottom of his shoes. thats not how it should be! Sonic also cant pick up speed by rolling anymore witch sucks the biggest balls as well. The levels themselfs can also feel a bit linier at times, especially in lost labyrinth. Also,  ♥♥♥♥ the physics    ♥♥♥♥ the physics        ♥♥♥♥ the physics, okay there not that bad but Sega could've done a much better job. So overall a mixed bag in gameplay.\n\nIn terms of graphics i think the game looks passable. some of the levels can look really nice especially lost labyrinth. the music is a mixed bag however, while some of the songs can be good to listen to with their mega divey feel, others can either be forgettable or more REPETETIVE! Im looking right at you boss themes!. One more nitpick is the amout of speed boosters in the levels. i'm not kidding their EVERYWHERE!!!!!!!!! Wheres the momentum based platforming?? What the ♥♥♥♥ sega! And for ♥♥♥♥s sake la7y off the ♥♥♥♥ing springs!!!\n\nSo overall is Sonic The Hedgehog 4: Episode 1 worth the £5 price tag. Well, it depends on if you are a hardcore sonic fan. If you're just getting into the series I don't recommend this, but is you are a sonic fan and are curios like I was then by all means have a shot, but I my opinion Episode 1 had so many missed opotunities and I think that its weakness.\n\nSCORE: 4/10\nPROS:\nGood Graphics\nOkay Music\nCONS:\nBleak Level Design\nOff-Putting Physics\nNo New Stage Themes\nWeightless Control\n\nReviewed: FEB 2016\n","February 18","false","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The level design, the characteristics, the way the game feels, and the physics. This game does just about all those things wrong, and I'm certainly not the first one to think so. So instead of that, I'm going to talk about Episode Metal on Sonic 4 episode 2, which unlocks if you own this game which I purchased in a recent sonic bundle. Now that game uses the physics from the much superior but still not amazing episode 2 and has revamped and harder levels of episode 1. You also play as Metal Sonic, who is clunky and pretty lame compared to sonic. I disliked Episode Metal because it reminded me how bland this game was, and I had only a twinge of fun playing it. I'd say if you're a platformer fan you might get something out of it, but if you're looking for a good sonic game, my go to game is Sonic 3 and Knuckles or Sonic CD. These new games don't have the same strife.

It's difficult to know where to start with this review. Although I would recommend this game based on the slightly above mediocre graphics I also don't recommend the game based on it's gameplay. It's definately a spiced up remake of the classic Sonic games from the Sega Mega Drive Classics - the Sonic games which I used to play on the old Sega Genesis console as a kid - but it's no where near as fun nor easy to control, instead you find some of the levels annoyingly frustrating and often get stuck because the worlds are now build in 3D graphics.\n\nAlthough it was a great concept and cool design I felt as though this game needed more work. I'm only giving it a good review because I did get it when it was on a super sale so I at least didn't waste too much money on it.\n\n5/10","March 9","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My favorite game was Sonic 3 & Knuckles but sadly Sonic 4 is a HUGE disappointment.\n\nThe physics and controls are not the same as the previous games, they try to behave the same but they kinda... feel fake.\n\nLevel design isn't that great either, in fact it tries to imitate most design and content from the previous titles, including the boss fights, where's the originality in that? Each title always had something new and fresh.\n\nLength of the game it's too short, yeah I know it's just 1 of 2 episodes, but that strategy was just to cash in on the same game twice.\n\nOverall, this game wasn't clearly designed by the original team behind the previous games (I should appreciate more info about this).\n\nIn resume:\n\nPROS:\n* Well... Sonic?\n* Nice 3D visuals\n* 2D Gameplay\n* No cutscenes\n* No new characters to fill yet more the Sonic universe.\n\nCONS:\n* Fake physics & controls regarding the previous titles.\n* Nothing significantly new in gameplay.\n* References of old games takes 95% of the game, I might as well play the old ones then...\n* Too short, only 5+Special Zones, Sonic 2 has 11+Special.\n\nIf you want a modern sonic game that is good go get Sonic Generations instead.\n\nPS: I don't dislike the game, I find it OKAY-ISH, but i can't really recommend it as a sequel to the old ones.","June 2","false","12.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
