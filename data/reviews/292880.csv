It has above average voice acting throughout. Story is cute - Robin is actually a GIRL so she can get away with more because all the guards are searching for a man. Though there are wanted adds all over for her (guess the guards are oblivious to those) so, in addition to the HO scenes, you're looking around for those wanted posters and ripping them up. :D As she recruits her merry men, she gains skills from them. Is that boulder too heavy to lift? Ask Little John to help. Need something pick pocketed? Call on Will Scarlet. And, of course, she has her own arrow abilities! There are also archery tournaments that test your mouse aiming skills. I normally dislike those kinds of things but, in this case, I found myself enjoying them and entering every competition I could. Regardless of all my good words, wait for a sale if you're interested in a purchase. It's a fairly short game, with no achievements or cards. And it's not "connected" to steam so no chatting with friends or pic taking while playing. I also found that every time I exited the game, steam would show it was still running so that was kind of a pain. But considering all the stinker HOs out there, I was pleasantly surprised by this gem. Hidden Object and Robin Hood fans should give this a try!","May 16, 2015","true","3.6"," 44 of 44 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","44","44","2","3"

If you are an adult who enjoys hidden objects games, you will find no challenge in either the puzzles or the archery mini game.  That aside, for children of ages 7 to 13, this is a pretty cute game.  The protagonist is a female and the story is set in the Middle Ages and draws on some of the Robin Hood lore, so it has appeal for both boys and girls.","May 14, 2014","true","5.9"," 27 of 27 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","27","27","0","0"

However, the more difficult mini-games can be skipped after a few seconds.\n\nAs an addition to the traditional HoGs, the game brings a basic questing system and special abilities that you can use to progress throughout the story. And of course, a hint system is always available to be used in case you get stuck.\n\nRobin’s Quest is a fun game that I enjoyed playing quite a lot and I recommend it mostly for the story line and the warm feeling of the scenes.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","November 9, 2014","true","3.2"," 21 of 21 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","21","21","0","0"

The game is done well, the graphics match the story and are pleasent to the eye. The gameplay and interface seem to work pretty well no real complaints there either. However, once I got going into the game it's clear that the game is designed for children 12 and under. The HOG were pretty simple and short and the puzzles were all very easy, probably except one and that was more time consuming then hard. If you have children under 12 it is highly recommended. It's a fun diversion for adults without much pressure involved if you really need to play a Robin Hood game.  My time in the game is five hours but had quite a bit of AFK time there. This is probably finishable in 2 hours, 3 tops. Give it a total thumbs up for children though and give it a rating of 7 for them.","March 7","true","5.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","2"

It's just a little too short, there are too many segments in which the next step is utterly obscure (with little or no help from the hints), and the kid-friendly setting and story, while nice enough, are lacking in atmosphere and suspense. There are also very few actual puzzles, so progression and hidden object are the main challenges.

It may sound cartoonish, but it’s fun, and this is what matters.\n\nThe difficulty also points towards a kids’ game. None of the puzzles pose any real challenge, although some of the hidden object scenes can be downright devilish. Every visited place offers small secrets to explore in the form of posters and collectible gold, but these serve no real purpose other than satisfying completionists: there are no extras, not even a high score table.\n\nStill, Robin’s Quest is a great little adventure recommended for everyone regardless of age. It’s just an enjoyable title for a low price.","January 25, 2015","true","3.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","6","7","2","0"

It's a little easy, but not outrageously so.    Many of the HOB/PnC games have so much counter intuitive backtracking that all you do is click Hint.  This game has managed to make you want to play it and if you even try a little you should find yourself using Hint sparingly.

It's colourful, easy and has a happy-go-lucky feel to it.\n\nThe first person is Robin Hood, a young woman who was imprisoned with her husband. She has to escape the prison, help the town citizens with their problems (mostly getting their gold/items back from mean leaders), gather up her merry men by collecting their pardons so they are free to roam the town, free her husband and confront the evil Prince John.\nThere is a lot of backtracking as you unlock companions with abilities as you progress and so have to go back to use them. There is a map, but it's completely useless and does not tell which areas are completed nor can it be used for teleporting.\nThe areas themselves have an Area Cleared sign when it has been cleared.\n\nThe game mostly has a Robin Hood-era feel to it with items and music, but some wtf-things stood out. Yin yang and statue of Vishnu? Really?\n\nBoth the hidden object games and the other mini-games are really simple, the archery contest adds a little to the game, though this also is fairly easy. You have 5 hints available, in the form of a jar of fireflies, and should you use all of them, you can wander around collecting more fireflies to get more hints. Hints can be used both in puzzles and to figure out in which direction you need to go next.\n\nGood game for children as a sort of introduction to both Robin Hood and HOGs. Might be worth its full price for children, but adults will want this on sale as it gets too easy.","May 19, 2015","true","2.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Otherwise, the only times i needed th hint system was to clean each area by finding the hidden gold.

Just putting in another thumbs up for the game and the voice acting in particular -- some of the guard conversations reminded me a lot of the original Thief, which was very cool. Definitely worth getting at the sale price if you like hidden object games.","July 7, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is a cute little game, with a fun story line, accompanied by appealing graphics and audio.  The character voices are funny, and the music is pleasant without feeling monotonous.\n\nUnfortunately I beat the entire thing in 2 hours, including all the optional archery contests except one that was bugged.  I got it on a super sale and paid less than two bucks, but I would have been disappointed if I'd paid the normal price for it.","July 8, 2015","true","2.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having a female protagonist is a nice change from the traditional story, and the story is pretty straightforward. On the downside, the only real challenge is finding all of the wanted posters and gold caches. Then again, on the upside you can go back and keep searching after you've won the game. All in all, it's a quick, relaxing experience. (The only reason my timestamp is over 2 hours is that I had just started the game and had to run an errand.)","February 27","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A bit on the easy side, but at least not frustrating.\nAs a female take on Robin Hood, you recruit the famous members of the Merry Men gang by helping them win pardons, in return for their skills as contextual abilities.\nGreat voice acting, especially on the main character Robin.\nArt is pretty good, and the UI is polished with excellent user experience.\nSide objectives like collectibles.\nOptional side games (archery competition) to offer a break from the quests. Because there's quests.\nThe game helpfully marks a scene as "area clear" when you've solved all puzzles and found all secrets in it. If it hasn't, you're missing something.What I didn't like\nLow resolution (garbled, blurry if played fullscreen).\n4:3 screen. Making it fullscreen on a widescreen monitor will stretch the game horizontally rather than add black bars, distorting everything.\nI didn't find much difference between Casual and Advanced modes of difficulty.\nThe archery side game is just one stage that's repeated in all the "competitions".\nHaving to play it windowed makes the objects in HO scenes harder to find.\nAll in all an excellent little HOG/adventure mix. About 4.5 hours worth of play. For the asking price, definitely recommended.","May 4","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not exceedingly long, I think I finished in around 3 hours, but the voice acting is excellent, and there's a few things it does that aren't done elsewhere.  The hidden object scenes are pretty crisp, and while you'll occasionally run across something that takes a little longer to find than normal, it's not because it was difficult, typically, but more that it was just getting glossed over.  I had a good time playing it, and that's all I really ask out of games.","May 4","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I liked the music, it was very soothing and it didn't become annoying to listen. Story-wise, the usual rescue someone and save the world, and graphics wise, while not as great as other popular hidden object games, the art is still appealing. I had one slight problem though. There isn't a graphics option to change the resolution so the game was displayed in a square in the middle of my screen. Other than that, not much to say about it negatively.","May 15","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
