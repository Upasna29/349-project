I have also completed every Assassin's Creed game to date on PC. This is my personal opinion, being very picky, and coming from the perspective of a long time Assassins Creed fan;\n\nPORT WISE\nI can say that it runs MUCH better than AC Unity does. I have a GTX 780 ti and everything is always perfectly smooth with all settings maxed out (at least 50-60 fps). I would get ridiculous random stutters on AC Unity. (Unfortunately, because these are console ports you won't be getting much more than that.)\n\nFor the first time in an AC game I feel Ubisoft has actually put forth effort with regard to the PC port (Unlike every other developer, I'm looking at you, Bethesda). Unfortunately these days the gaming industry is more aimed at consoles. However they have actually removed mouse lag/mouse acceleration so navigating menus, moving camera around etc is more responsive. AC Unity was a headache to navigate around. Not surprising as they received ALOT of backfire from AC Unity last year.\n\nThe user interface could be toned down a bit. It has definitely been improved since AC Unity however there are some things that are just not needed/should be implemented in a different way. For example the detection ring around the character, enemy levels above their head etc.\n\n\nGAMEPLAY WISE\nPretty much the same as any other Assassin's Creed game. Small improvements are made with regard to navigation, combat and stealth. The rope launcher feels like its needed as the streets are wider. Combat feels more responsive and fast paced. However it still feels like a constant 'click fest'. Stealth is made more simple with a simpler cover system. HOWEVER I believe the enemy detection system requires an overhaul. Silently kidnap an enemy, and suddenly 10 enemy carriages appear from nowhere and chase you down. Same with killing an enemy via a ranged weapon. Every enemy in the area is suddenly aware of your presence.\nWith regard to side content, I honestly believe they should stop adding in 'stuff to do for the sake of stuff to do'. There are alot of icons on the map and most if not all of these activites require you to 'kill/kidnap this enemy'. I wish they'd bring back old school Assassination contracts.\n\nSTORY WISE **SPOILERS**\nIt seems to be the same protocol every year for Assassins Creed in regard to the story; create a likeable, humorous protagonist that defeats the bad guy (Since ACIV at least).\nI can say that I believe Jacob and Evie were not introduced very well. Start up a new game and you're all of a sudden assassinating enemies as Jacob. We don't know where he's from, what his motives are or what situation he's in. Its hard to describe.\nI feel I do not always agree with the motives and feelings of the protagonists. Yes, they are freeing slaves, liberating London etc but I think it takes more than that to make you want to progress further.\n\nYou need to feel the emotions the protagonist is feeling. These characters have no motivation at all other than simply 'going after the bad guy because he is bad', which is lazy character development. Ezio, Edward and even Connor were perfect examples. They weren't simply 'going after the bad guy', they had realistic goals/motives. As much as Jacob and Evie are 'likeable' characters, there is simply no character development, the protagonists do not 'learn anything new' from their adventures, and their stories are rather abruptly ended. But YES they are somewhat likeable.\n\nAt the start of the game we are introduced to the big bad guy, Crawford Starrick, that is trying to control London and 'must be killed'. So without hesitation Jacob and Evie go after him and eventually kill him. They are thanked by the queen and the game ends. WTF? No epic plot twist or cliffhangers? Come on Ubisoft, this is the most boring, unexciting and predictable story yet. As much as I hate to say it, but even AC Unity had a more exciting story.\nThere are characters that COULD have been interesting/memorable like Henry Green, but unfortunately only have a few lines of dialogue.\n\nOnce again I believe the modern day story is lacking. You can tell that Ubisoft is simply trying to appeal to a wider audience by almost ditching the modern day story. On a positive note, I am glad they decided to include Juno in the storyline this time. But they really need to step up their game in regard to the modern day story. Give us a character to control, don't throw these 5 minute cutscenes at us.\n\nBOTTOM LINE\nI do not feel like an Assassin anymore. Instead I feel more like a gang leader or a street thug in a 'beat em up' game, which I think is wrong. In my opinion, Ubisoft needs to stop and think to themselves 'Okay, what does being an assassin actually mean?'. Assassins are supposed to hide from the general public. Instead we are openly starting gang wars. Assassins are supposed to be feared. Every enemy treats you like they are not scared at all. Taunting/intimidating you as you walk by. Remember that time in AC2 when you killed Uberto Alberti in open public? Everyone was shocked. Civilians were terrified. Assassinations need to be like that.\nAssassins are also supposed to be a 'brotherhood'. Where were all the other assassins in London?\n\nThis is a great Assassins Creed game and I recommend it. Unfortunately, because its one of Ubisoft's best selling franchises, they feel the need to release annually which results in similar recycled content each year. Ubisoft really needs to go back to the 'core' of the franchise and make an effort to appeal to long time fans, NOT just always 'casual gamers' every year.\n\nI don't understand why so many people think AC Syndicate "made up for what AC Unity did wrong". On the technical side, yes, it runs much smoother. But gameplay and story are still the same standard. Unmemorable characters with no development, anticlimatic story, same graphics, very similar gameplay.\n\nSo YES, I recommend Assassin's Creed Syndicate. But don't expect huge improvements or anything revolutionary.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read.","November 22, 2015","true","27.9"," 623 of 680 people (92%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","92","623","680","26","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/368500/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The Assassin’s Creed series has been on a slow and steady decline ever since 2010's Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood, with each yearly release becoming slightly more disappointing than the last - the only exceptions being Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and Assassin's Creed Rogue, which were arguably better pirate games than they were Assassin’s Creed games. Things finally came to a head last year with the release of Assassin's Creed Unity, which was so broken and bug-filled at launch that Ubisoft gave away some of its DLC for free as an apology.Thankfully Assassin's Creed Syndicate stops that trend by stripping away much of the excess baggage that the series has picked up and returns the franchise to its early roots in the new setting of Industrial Era London.\n\nAssassin’s Creed Syndicate sees the time-jumping, historical series take its first real leap from the Medieval Age into 1868’s Industrial Revolution-era, Victorian London. With the Assassin’s Order in England’s capital all but wiped out, the city is under the control of Templar Grand Master Crawford Starrick, who influences and controls all of the city - from its medicine and finance to its industry and criminal underworld. There is also finally some progression in the modern day story that seems to have stalled since the end of Assassin's Creed III. This time around they take the form of infrequent cut scenes that last just long enough to be insightful and add something to the overall plot, but never so long that they outstay their welcome.\n\nFor the first time in the series, Syndicate provides two playable characters in the form of twins Evie and Jacob Frye, who have contrasting personalities and motives for disobeying orders from the Brotherhood in order to head for London. Jacob plays the part of a lovable rogue; suave, sarcastic and at times hot-headed, he wants to take back the city and fight the Templars head-on by forming a rival street gang called the Rooks. Evie is a much more devout Assassin and sees the greater picture as she remains focused to her primary objective of finding a missing piece of Eden which is rumored to be in London, while at the same time constantly tidying up the mess her brother makes.\n\nBoth protagonists are extremely likable characters for very different reasons, and you are free to switch between the pair throughout much of the game, as you take on side missions and open world objectives with whichever sibling you please. The main story missions are different, however forcing you to play as one twin or the other depending on which of their goals the mission is working towards. This works extremely well in keeping the story feeling fresh by providing an ever-changing dynamic, also allows you to learn more about each sibling individually, and adds weight to their opposing viewpoints. As a pair the dialogue they share is extremely well written, and by playing as both, you are in the unique position of being able understand both sides of their relationship - which is laced with sibling rivalry and often ends in disagreement.\n\nSyndicate’s main story missions seem longer than in previous titles, and whilst each one is basically asking you to perform tasks that we have already been doing for years, the characters and story help them all appear surprisingly unique. There’s also a feeling that the developers have allowed much more freedom to approach missions any way that you want, with far fewer missions causing an instant fail for being spotted. One of the best new additions that further increases the feeling of player choice is the introduction tactical choices before some of the larger assassination missions. If you wish you can ignore these options completely and run in and try to take out every guard in sight before fighting your target to the death, but quite often the best and most rewarding choice it to the follow the game’s lead by stealing a key, kidnapping a person who can get you next to your target, find a secret passage, or even pose as a dead body in order to get up close without being detected.\n\nSimilar to previous games in the franchise, outside of the main story you can take part in many side objectives that help to reduce the Templar control in that district of the city. These missions take the form of much more repetitive objectives than the main story missions, but the way that they are linked into the overall story works far better than in previous iterations. It made much more sense to be fighting gang bosses, hijacking cargo and liberating children from the oppressive factories than climbing towers to light a torch has done in the past.\n\nThe game’s supporting cast of characters is larger than it has been previously, and all of them are a joy to encounter, offering memorable missions that range from escorting Benjamin Disraeli’s wife through the most dangerous part of London, stealing uniforms for Frederick Abberline, and hunting occultists whilst dressed as Sherlock Holmes. There’s a far greater sense of fun to Syndicate than we have seen previously from a series that has sometimes taken itself a little too seriously, which helps keep the game interesting throughout.\n\nThe story's main antagonist, Crawford Starrick, is one of the more fleshed out villains that the series has seen, and is the type of enemy that you will love to hate. At times he remains surprisingly calm despite his grip on London loosening with each defeat, and at others he is filled with murderous rage, but whichever mood you find him in, he’s always interesting to watch and plays the role perfectly.\n\nUbisoft Quebec have done a brilliant job of recreating London and many of its most well-known landmarks, and found fun ways to incorporate them into different missions throughout the story. Each area of the city has a different look and feel to the next; poorer areas such as Whitechapel feature muddy streets and a skyline filled with large chimneys bellowing thick black smoke into the air while the more upmarket Westminster has tree lined roads and the Houses of Parliament. The whole city feels alive and full of things for you to discover and do.\n\nThe addition of the horse and carriage plays a large role in how you navigate around the huge open world, and whilst this is by far the quickest form of travel, they aren’t as fun as using the new rope launcher which acts as both a grappling hook to scale buildings faster and as a zip line to cross London’s wide streets.\n\nPerhaps the biggest plus point in Syndicate is how simplified it is. Gone are the ridiculous chests that required the use of a second-screen app to open, and both the multiplayer and co-op have been removed completely. That may be a negative to some, but it seems clear that the focus of development on just the core single player element has helped provide a much more polished and stable game this time around.\n\nThe controls for the game feel like they are much more refined too, with far fewer instances of your character trying to climb over objects that you intended to walk past and moments of being stuck to walls. There’s also a much smaller choice of weapons to use in combat. Gone are the weapon wheels that enabled you to carry multiple short and long ranged weapons. In its place you choose one main weapon for each protagonist for short range combat, and long range projectiles can be switched between throwing knives, pistol or smoke bombs.\n\nAssassin’s Creed Syndicate is thankfully a fine return to form for the franchise. The combination of an interesting and diverse cast of characters and the entertaining and compelling story sit perfectly in the beautifully recreated 1860’s London. It doesn’t do everything to solve all the series’ problems, but by taking a step backwards and removing much of the excess baggage that the series has accumulated over the years of annual releases, Syndicate has become the best Assassin's Creed since Brotherhood.","January 1","true","99.9"," 393 of 425 people (92%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","92","393","425","16","5"

Not perfect, not a best game since ac2, but pretty great. City is vast, detailed and beautiful. Main characters are charming and make a good duo. Gameplay, as always, somewhat the same, somewhat new and interesting(first time I saw rope launcher I thought "Oh, they're making it easier, that'll kill parkour, this series is done for!", but 5 minutes later I found myself joyfully zipping and zapping on that thing all over the place). Quality of the story is subjective, but I enjoyed it. A step back from epic battles and world-shaking revolutions felt nice. Modern time storyline is still told through CG cinematics, but actually kinda matters this time. The game looks gorgeous too, just as good as unity, but optimized a bit better this time, haven't encountered any terrible fps drops or a single bug.\n\nYou could've skipped Unity, but you should buy Syndicate.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InAmberClad/recommended/368500/","InAmberClad","InAmberClad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InAmberClad/","2094 products in account","Let's start this recommendation with a bit of background information about my history with Assassin's Creed. It's important, yes, yes it is.\n\nI loved Assassin's Creed, ever since the first game, the one where you play as the weird monkey, I mean monk, Altair. You climb from building to building, start beating up people, stabbing them, jumping around, the bread and butter formula of Assassin's Creed.\n\nAssassin's Creed 2 took this system to a whole new level, with the introduction of Ezio, whom in my opinion, is still the best character in the entire series. Then came Brotherhood, Revelations, 3, Liberation, etc etc, it's all the same formula with slightly different changes per game. For instance, the Twin Blades in AC2, the Hookblade in Revelations, and the usage of recruits in Brotherhood.\n\nThe series, was awesome.\nHOWEVER, the Assassin's Creed did get plagued by several things, but mainly, Uplay, or as I'd like to call it, U-♥♥♥♥♥-play. It's horrible, AC2 was "DRM-ed" with having a constant connection to the servers, only problem being was that the servers happily cut off connection every 10 seconds, causing you to get booted from AC2.\n\nANYWAY. After that massive screw over by Ubisoft with Unity, I decided to boycott the entire series. Microtransactions? ♥♥♥♥♥♥ performances even on my GTX970? Yeah, I was done with the AC series. Till Syndicate had a 40% sale, and I figured, hey let's give this game another chance!\n\nAnd I'm glad I did, for the first few hours anyway.\n\nLet's talk about Graphics.\nIt's amazing, it's beautiful, and London is one huge city to explore. Most importantly, it runs on Ultra settings with my 970, something Unity failed to do even with 4x Titan Xs. Yeah, the optimization for this game is nicely done (after two weeks anyway).\n\nNow moving on to Gameplay..\nIt's typical Assassin's Creed, you jump, you fly, you go left and right, you stab people. Except now, they make you choose between a stealth character or a brawling character. Some like the AC combat system, I personal prefer the stealth elements. Both characters share the same EXP pool, so you can switch between them as and when you like.\n\nBy the way, controls are dumb-ed down, you just hold one button to fly across the map. There's no elements such as  near fall, or any other more complicated buttons to press for that matter. It's literally a babi-ed Assassin's Creed, there's no more complexity that the older games delivered.\n\nHow about the story?\nIt's, once again, a typical Assassin's Creed story. Assassin's trying to over throw Templars. It's been the same thing since the first game. Although I do hate the inturruptions between the real world and the London world, YES THAT ANNOYING MID SEQUENCE THING IS STILL THERE. Why didn't they bring back the Black Flag system beats me, it worked.\n\nAudio?\nThe music is medicore at most, upon launching most AC games, you'll instantly get drawn to the menu music. Personally, I felt that Syndicate's music is a lot weaker compared to the other AC games. AC1's Credits Song, AC2's Venice Rooftops, AC:B Master Assassin and even AC3's Main Theme, all of these had a lasting impact on the player because of the nature of the piece. Sadly, Syndicate's music doesn't deliver that tier, the music is good, but it won't stick with you.\n\nMultiplayer?\nFirst Unity removed the AMAZING multiplayer experience started by Brotherhood. Gone were the days where you tried to assassinate another Assassin while at the same time, running away from your own Assassin / Templar.\nThey threw in Co-Op instead\n\nThen Syndicate removed Co-Op.\nYep.\nWhat Multiplayer?\n\nWhat about the microtransactions in this game?\nFk off Ubisoft.\n\nThis is a slight Yes to recommending this game since it IS Assassin's Creed, and it IS fun for a while (at least).\n\nPros\n- Not Unity\n- It's a DECENT Assassin's Creed\n- The story is alright\n- Game is really, really well optimized\n- It's Not Unity\n- Did I mention it's not Unity?\n\nCons\n- Micro-♥♥♥♥♥-transactions\n- Dumb-ed down controls\n- Medicore Soundtrack\n- No Multiplayer\n- Did I mention Micro-♥♥♥♥♥ transactions?","December 6, 2015","true","15.0"," 383 of 474 people (81%) found this review helpful 144 people found this review funny","81","383","474","144","26"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thessianfox/recommended/368500/","thessianfox","Philippa Eilhart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thessianfox/","124 products in account","Syndicate represents the first step in the right direction for Ubisoft after the recent disappointments in the Assassin's Creed series, improving upon the core gameplay and taking the franchise to new heights. It became my favorite Ubi game, and in my opinion the best of AC yet. Beautiful, immersive, vivid Victorian London that's very fun to explore with more polished mechanics and some new elements thrown into the mix. I must also mention the game's great voice acting, and its sublime soundtrack, contributing to the setting's appeal. The side activities are entertaining, and its combat feels smooth and very satisfying, with both protagonists. Despite each other's different strengths and their showcased individuality, both Evie and Jacob are fun to play as, and their skills are yours to select. Evie is without a doubt the more compelling of the two as a well-written protagonist, and her calculated stealthy style really suits her and her path towards her endgame goals. The twins' dynamic, however, mostly stemming from their differences, is very fun to watch.\nGiven Ubi's past mistakes, perhaps the most pleasant surprise about ACS is that its PC version does not disappoint - not only it looks gorgeous, but it's one of the best I've played this year; some hiccups here and there - minor things that patches will certainly take care of soon, but overall optimized and runs well within one's hardware limits, and I have a mid-range rig.\nA fun game with a refreshing choice in protagonists, moderately intriguing main storylines with a few history icons as associates, and a rich setting that can easily draw you in with its stunning sights and enjoyable activities.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/368500/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2816 products in account","Assassin’s Creed Syndicate is an action adventure game developed and published by Ubisoft, releasing in October 2015 for the PS4, Xbox One and PC. This is the 9th game in the Assassin’s Creed series so far. The game is run using the AnvilNext 2.0 engine, which was used in AC Unity and Rainbow Six Siege.\n\nFor the game play, most will probably be already well aware of what to expect from an Assassin’s Creed game. You play as one of two playable characters, Evie and Jacob Frye.  A new, welcome mechanic to the game is a rope launcher, allowing the characters to quickly scale larger buildings and to create their own zip-lines for easier travel between buildings too. The combat system is at its best again with a very easy to use control set.  The game is set in London, and you are able to freely roam the city completing all kinds of quests, finding collectables and locating treasure scattered around the world. Whilst the game play is considered the same as the rest of the games, I still really enjoyed it.\n\nGraphically, Syndicate looks gorgeous, I sadly was not able to run the game at 4k, but was able to push all of the graphics up to max on 1440. The City of London just looks amazing. The textures are of all high quality, animation is almost seemly showing on all of the characters. It is a huge improvement over the previous entries to the series. Voice acting is spot on with the classic London accent on all characters found throughout the game.\n\nYou should not expect a challenging game when playing Syndicate, as long as you stick to the areas of London that is within your level range, you probably won’t die at all. You can challenge yourself by going to the higher level zones before you should, but I found myself to getting completely overrun by more powerful enemies quicker than normal. The game’s skills trees are very well designed to let you build your two characters to specialise in different trees. I went for Evie being the more stealth oriented character and Jacob the more hand-fisted of the two. I really liked having the option of the two characters as it lets you choose the right head for the job you have been tasked to do.\n\nLike I said above, the city is jam-packed full of things to do, gang wars, freeing laboured children, finding rare wine or searching for treasure. There are hours of content to be found after you complete the game, with plenty of side quests to take on as well. This was one of the few Assassins’ Creed games that I actually really enjoyed doing the optional tasks in.\n\nI have been playing Syndicate for about 50 hours so far. The main story only takes about half of that. I wouldn’t say there is a huge level of replay ability in this game, as the story is linear and the lack of any difficulty options means you can’t replay the game in a sort of New Game + mode. Although I am very happy with the amount of hours I have put into the game so far and not many people about the amount of content on offer in this game.\n\nThankfully I didn’t have any technical problems. I wasn’t able to run at 4k, because it is simply too taxing at this moment in time. But the game ran as smooth as butter at 1440p in 60 fps. The game is very well optimized and loading times are almost none-existent. I played with a controller and I would suggest you do to as the combat system just matches up well with it.\n\nTo sum up, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate is one of the better games in the series, coming close to Black Flag as the best.  The characters are probably the most loveable of all of the series so far, with Evie being the first female protagonist. The game has plenty of content, and shows off extremely high production values in the graphics and sound departments. The lack of any technical problems also counts as a major positive for the AC series too given past releases not being so smooth. As with all recently released games in this series, you should expect a premium price tag, and this is no different at £39, 99. If you can wait it out another few months you can probably get it for £30, but I would say the game is even worth it at full price right now.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

Syndicate is the first in the series I have actually, legitimately enjoyed in almost all regards. Part of this is due to a bit of personal bias - Victorian London has always been a favorite setting of mine and it's here in beautiful, meticulously detailed glory. But aside from that, the actual gameplay is improved, specifically with stealth and traversal. Botching a stealth kill doesn't automatically alert everyone and their mother within a 20 mile radius, and the zipline lets you avoid having to ponderously pick your way up every single building facade if you don't want to. Furthermore, each sidequest can be completed through a number of different methods, and there's not an overwhelming amount of stupid collectibles. And while the story itself is merely okay, the characters you meet and play as are all pretty charming and even legit funny. Syndcicate seems to be all about removing all the series' barriers between you and fun, and it's definitely working for me.","December 6, 2015","true","34.4"," 95 of 119 people (80%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","80","95","119","13","3"

We don't need a carbon copy of Ezio, but sadly Ubisoft can't make any other set of characters as interesting as the ones in the Ezio trilogy. They aren't bad but they aren't great either\n\nBut gameplay-wise? This is where the game truly shines. I haven't experienced this kind of feeling with an AC game since I played AC2 after playing the first one.\n\nThe game takes the best bits from Unity and makes them better, like the new to the series stealth system, parkour system, customization, skills, and some resemblance to the combat (blocking at the exact time is not important tho, and the combat feels more arcade-button mashing style, way faster than any AC game)\n\nThe combat may feel clunky at first, but for me it was an acquired taste. The parkour however, feels as fluid as ever and the new grappling hook is a really nice addition in my opinion, and if you don't enjoy it you can avoid it without problem.\n\nI also think the new missions are designed way better, I have not finished the game yet, but the missions make way more sense, are more interesting and way less repetitive than the first games. No more endless tale missions, there is an immense variety of stuff to do, and every type of mission requires a different aproach, you're not going to try the same thing inside a factory than aboard a boat.\n\nThe thing is, the stealth is implemented way better in this games than in previous ones, the mission design is more open and interesting and the navigation through the world is fluid, also taking into account the carriages.\n\nThe game is chaotic and it doesn't take itself too seriously,that is a really fresh change that the franchise needed.\nFor the people like me who likes the modern story, the game is a small step but in the right direction, there are just 10 minutes worth of cinematics, which kind of sucks, but it means that Ubisoft knows that the modern day storyline is necessary to keep a lot of old fans buying the games.\n\nSo, in the end, it is not the perfect AC game. it has its problems, but the gameplay is really well designed and it really shows that the developers are walking towards the right direction, in a way (if you don't b*tch a lot about every little mistake you might find just for the ♥♥♥♥ of it) it could be said that this is the return of the franchise...\n\n(sorry for bad english, not my native language)","November 20, 2015","true","48.0"," 77 of 99 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","77","99","4","4"

In the past games, there have also been bugs and glitches. Some were very frustrating, and others were just design flaws. However, assassin's creed takes a grip on you. It tells you "just one more assassination mission. Just one." Well, you're not longer an assassin in this game. Now you're just some criminal.\n\nI can look past the repetitive fetch-quests that litter the game. In past assassin's creed titles, fetch quests meant a unique dagger or sword that employed unique animations. It meant an outfit that looked very different from everything else. It meant real bonuses, payments for your hard work. This game doesn't reward you in the same way. Did you finish tediously leaping about gardens, trying to find pressed flowers for someone? Good. Here's a new color for the outfits you already have. Did you finish collecting bogus music boxes? Oh good, here's an outfit that looks like someone forgot to color it. It even glitches on its own - and in the case of this outfit, they treat the glitching as a feature, not a bug.\n\nIt doesn't motivate me to move on to another fetch-quest.\n\nI can look past the wonky controls. In past titles, it could mean odd camera angles that make things difficult because forward command suddenly becomes right, or left, or down. Or it could mean running past a ladder and suddenly your character does a 90 degree turn and starts to climb it. But the controls have always been a problem for the assassin's creed franchise. The freedom you get with how you can move through the game, also limits the paths you can take while doing so. That's fine, if perhaps annoying.\n\nI can look past a lot of things.\n\nAnd now there will be some spoilers. You should not read further if you're senstive to such. I am not revealing story plots here by definition, but some characters will be revealed (they're not surprises, so it shouldn't matter) and some gear (which you'll get almost at the very beginning).\n\nRight off the bat, yes bat, as in batman - you get batman gear. Batman gear, really? You get this rope launcher thing that allows you to zip across roofs. And you get it by looting it off of a bad guy. Right after you take it to Graham Bell (yeah I know) you get a quest where it can be used. Upon your return, your sibling and mister Bell explains that they just so happened to get their hands on another one. Aright, you think. So myself and the bad guys have rope launchers.\n\nNo you don't. You and your sibling does. Because apparently, the bad guys in this game think rope launchers are impractical, so no one but you and your sister has them. In spite of you looting off of a low level boss type. The lowly gang leader has one, but not the templars? Please stop hurting my narrative, Ubisoft.\n\nAssassin's creed have always been about alternative stories to explain historical events. Ezio had a gun, and a flying machine! But you could accept that. The story explains how and why they work. I question the rope launcher - because I don't get it. How does it launch? Gun powder? But it has an infinite number of shots. Not even connor could use his ropes an infinite number of times, and his were so short that they were retrievable. Is the launcher using gas? How? By what technological marvel during 1868 is it propelling this thick metal arrow that for some reason can fasten to anything, AND hold your weight?\n\nThe parkour skills are there so you can be able to traverse buildings and alike with relative ease. Yet this is not enough? You get a rope launcher? Ubisoft is crazy for fetch quests. How about making it so you have to put up ropes and lines yourself, which you can use thereafter to traverse buildings? Why a rope launcher? How does thi fit in? I mean what's in the next assassin's creed game? A jetpack during ww1? How about a teleporting device during ww2 and your own UFO by the Vietnam war? It's not a big issue, but it contributes to lower the score of this game.\n\nYou meet five famous individuals (at least as far as I have played) leaping about London at the same time, handing out quests like they're candy at halloween. It's too much. I mean, when Da Vinci popped up in Ezio's story, assassin's creed was really balancing on the knife edge of credibility already. You could accept it historically though, because Da Vinci was involved with Medici, and so is Ezio. Da Vinci did have theories on flight, so you can buy that idea as well. But in this game? No... Just no. Charles Darwin, Graham Bell, Karl Marx, Charles Dickens, Florence Nighingale... All mashed into 1868 London and all just happen to have numerous quests to dish out to you, the leader of the Rooks - a criminal gang?\n\nAnd then there's the bogus quest stories, like events where I am supposed to chase someone whom I can see is being fast forwarded in order to escape me. Not even joking, this was an old man and he outruns me, an assassin trained parkour expert, in the prime of my youth and at my physical peak. Really? He just outruns me, like that? If you don't chase him, he slows down to the normal hobbling of an old man, but if you get close, he's fast forwarded. This is unacceptable for a modern game. Hypnotism? Again - not joking here. It's not only hypnotism, hypnotism I can handle. The change of someone's behavior through methodical influence during hypnotism has been documented, if not proven. But this isn't clinical hypnotism, but cartoon hypnotism. Pendulum in the street and everything. Ghosts? No, really. I am not joking. They have ghosts. Am I playing Assassin's Creed: Scooby Do goes to London? What on earth possessed Ubisoft to allow such a corruption of their own franchise?\n\nAnd talking about assassin's creed. What about the actual creed that assassin's follow? Where you simply aren't allowed to kill innocents? In this game, if I shoot two civilians with a gun, I desynchronize. However, if I hijack a carriage as if this was GTA 1860, I can run over the entire population with no consequences.\n\nAnd the population; non believable drones walking back and fourth, occasionally stopping to stab one another to death. Yep, that's apparently common in London 1868. Maybe that's why no one really cares if you gun down a dozen people in the street. I mean - not even the middle ages when you played Altair was this bloody. You build up your own team that has absolutely zero function for you as an assassin. If you do bring allies, they will always ruin you being an assassin. You can even hire street kids to do your bidding. However, these are special street kids, who enjoy living in the gutter, stealing to survive. How do I know? Because after you've recruited them, you can get items from them. What items do the street kids have you ask? You'd think a pocket watch. Maybe someone stole a purse with a few cash in them? You'd be gravely mistaken. These kids are sporting 60 units of metal, 50 units of cloth, which they willingly give to you. Now, I know what you're thinking - how much is a unit? Well I don't know. But I do know one of them handed me 5000 cash, which is enough to say... Buy a bar in the game. Or several weapons. Or refeill your gear numerous times. This street kid hands it over with a smile on his face though. Totally believable and doesn't ruin your immersion one bit.\n\nNo. It ruins several bits. Several bits and some bobs in fact.\n\nIt's... I... There are no words for the atrocity that this game is. At first I thought; well, I paid good money for this game. I am at least going to finish it. After all, I did pay for it. But then my logic kicked in and I thought; so, if I finish this game, I will have both lost money AND time? You can always get more money. But you can never get more time. Time is the only finite resource in your life, of which you will always have less and less and less.\n\nSo no. I won't finish this game.\nAnd neither should anyone else.\n\nDon't buy this.","December 7, 2015","false","47.6"," 295 of 453 people (65%) found this review helpful 65 people found this review funny","65","295","453","65","22"

Ubisoft knows they messed up last time and while I am actually in the minority that really enjoyed Unity, I was not blind to it's problems, mainly its optimization problems. In terms of story or gameplay that's all up to the individual if they enjoy that or not, (which I personally enjoyed quite a bit). However the most important thing a game, especially on PC, needs is stability and that is what Syndicate has that Unity lacked. I have a Nvidia Geforce 750Ti and have graphics set to medium quality and so far have stayed at 55 to 60 Fps through fighting, climbing, and just roaming around the large map filled with impressive visuals and large amounts of AI. I have not come across any gamebreaking bugs as of yet (doesn't mean they might not be out there). The gameplay actually reminds me a little of GTA: San Andreas with the gang gameplay, taking over neighborhoods and being able to recruit a posse of gang members to help you fight.  I would say this game is a very good addition to the AC franchise and is worth trying out.\n\nEDIT: I am also using an i7 processor and installed the game on an SSD.

And I was allured by the idea of using a gang to dominate london's streets.\n\nAfter AC3, which left me with a disappointment so big that I skipped on buying Black Flag, which in turn ended being one of my favourite assassin's creeds after I decided to play it in my brother's account. I deeply regret this, because the theme of pirates and plunder turned out to give Kenway a much better story than his grandson.\n\nThis one caught me by surprise, from the start they throw you into one of the missions of jacob and evie, working for the creed. A clever way to present how the Frye twins charge at their problems and to give you a glimpse of their personality. Jacob is a "clever bloke" cocky, and headstrong who wants to bring london back to the hands of the assassin's even if they have to become a gang itself, not that worried about the creed, but more focused on destroying the opposition, Jacob ends up giving a lot of trouble to the templars.\n\nMeanwhile Evie is a more collected but far from calm dutiful assassin, who wants to follow up on the lead that her father had on the Shroud of Eden, an artifact recovered by Edward Kenway and hidden in London making the story feel like a follow up to Black Flag's, which just makes it even more enjoyable.\n\nThe enemies this time aren't as strong as their leader, which appears with every few assassinations to remind you how much of a evil gentleman he is, giving you a small glimpse of the templar side from time to time. Some of the templars aren't as memorable as in other games, but one of the best things about this game is that every templar that you must kill comes with a set of tools that you can follow to kill him in a cool way, or do it yourself, making it feel like how the hitman games gave you alternatives to enter and assassinate your target.\n\nWhat this game lacks a bit is more important support characters for the Twins, there's no "la volpe" or the courtesans, or even the thieves from venice in AC2, and there's no manager of the gang, the rooks, which made the rooks seem more like a helping hand for you rather than something to get sad or invested in when they die during a mission.\n\nBut let's talk about mechanics a bit. This game adds carriages and the "hookshot" as I like to call it, that give you a different way to maneuver around. The carriages allow you to stay on top of them while a rook from your team drives for you, letting you fight your enemies or even jump to their carriage, kick them out and steal theirs, all of this seamlessly! it's an amazing work for sure. Back to the to hook, you can use it to easily reach other buildings in a faster way, giving you an alternative to just going through the building, and making it much easier to travel not only vertically, but between buildings, giving the tools to go from the river thames all the way to the top of the big ben in a much easier and quicker fashion. it's so enjoyable to just waltz around with these that you'll probably catch yourself strolling around london looking for more secrets rather than making the templar assassinations.\n\ntl;dr\n\n+Good Protagonists that actually make strong impacts in London\n+Lovely craftmanship of London and its Victorian Era of innovations and advancements.\n+Fight on top of carriages seamlessly and hijack the opponents carriage while you move away from the police!\n+Great maneuverability vertically and horizontally between the gothic architecture of the Victorian Era using the Grappling Hook.\n+A Moving Train Base with all your accomplishments decorating the walls!\n+An enjoyable story with references to the best past AC Games.\n+AMAZING Soundtrack full of violins packed with that london feel!\n\n-Lack of support characters related to your gang, making you not worry what happens to your gang when you use them in combat\n-Villains don't come around that often to give you that needed edge against the templars.\n-They still talk about the animus and the not so interesting story of shaun and rebecca, but just with videos, making it much better than having to play with desmond like in previous installments.\n\nOverall I had a blast with this game, The soundtrack is packed with accordeons and violins, that add a certain sherlock-esque, that just nails the london feel so well. Fighting is really enjoyable and rather than just being a prince of persia esque fight like in the early ac games, its focused on combos and killstreaks from punching people in the face, I strongly recommend you to play it if you were a fan of the series and wants a throwback to those good times of ezio, they made the right choice on not doing a multiplayer, letting them focus on adding more content to the main game.","December 13, 2015","true","44.9"," 44 of 54 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","44","54","2","2"

Actually the franchise is died after AC4 so i went into it expecting unity 2.0, but what I got ohhhhhh boy was so much more, it's fast paced action and nice story . Jacob and Evie are such a warm welcome back to the series, the implementation of two characters gives us the gamers more......personality, the chemistry and development between the two is impeccable. The gameplay on the other hand is also fantastic, a bit overwhelming at first but after you become numb to it, it's amazing!! Where once I was concerned that the technology would ruin this franchise it only added to it, grappling hooks (which at first I was worried about), trains, carriages, revolvers, etc. All added something that assassins creed needed. In all this year was the shake up this franchise needed the only flaw is....take a guess...... The modern story.... But I honestly don't think it will get any better in games to come, but that aside the game puts life into a dying franchise and definitely adds an apology for unity.","May 20","true","365.5"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","33","39","0","0"

It plays like Unity.\n\nI'm writing from Memory 04, which so far has given me the game's hookshot tool, but hasn't given me more than a glimpse at the piece of Eden or whatever it is they've insisted is For Great History this time around.  The hookshot is actually pretty cool.\n\nWe now have skill trees, which I'd feel inclined to roll my eyes at, except it really does instill this feeling of growth, that your character(s) are going from rookies to experts.  I'm not sure I care for the progression though, as it's kind of convoluted with levels.  Could've just done skills, I think, and the gear you can find/craft is available by level, which is frustratingly artificial.\n\nWe do not have ships.  I feel like one of the very few who liked the ships, so it bears mention and is probably a pro to most players.  And hiring your gangthugs is kind of unintuitive - they aren't very smart and will spoil their share of mission objectives by killing foes or running jack-stupid through an enemy base you're trying to infiltrate.  Without the gang, most the game's various areas feel pretty cool (and are surprisingly not ruined by the Hookshot, as was my other fear).\n\nCharacter switching is unexpectedly disappointing.  You have to go into the pause menu and arbitrarily tap some key, to see the portrait change.  It then dumps you from the start menu (even if I'm just trying to buy the other character some skill or gear), or it will tell you with no explanation that you can't switch to this character right now.  GTAV did this better, and seemingly without effort.  And they're supposedly meant to be different by having separated end-game skills but to be honest I can barely see the difference when I'm trying to find it.  In the narrative sequences I find myself liking the characters, but I still feel like this was a gimmicky response to some meaningless criticism I never bothered to look into.  "We want to play both genders!" just isn't something I can imagine rational people belting out that often.\n\nSpeaking of GTAV, the horse-drawn carriages are okay.  They're the thinnest replacement for cars I've ever played - I mean, you can even crash and ram things with your horses and literally you can take your coach in reverse.  It's a car.\n\nAlso returning from Unity is Ubisoft's Moneywagon Spendly Goodtimes™, allowing us to fork over yet more cash in order to suffer less of a grind.  None of that's necessary - you can operate just as well without forking over that cash, just with slower progression.\n\nAnd while I just can't believe I'm saying this, since I abhor most online game crowds and implementations, I really do miss Unity's Co-Op.  I think they should've included it but, I guess there wasn't much payoff.  All those little club activities were pretty lame, but the rest of it was ridiculously fun, and satisfied my vanity of being a ninja and running around on top of buildings like it ain't no thang.  Now I can only do that from the solitude of my keyboard.\n\nAll around, this game probably won't unseat other AC entries from being your favorite, but it isn't lacking of much that we've come to expect.  If you're trying to hold off on buying this, you should because at this stage, our Season Cashtickets aren't worth anything and Ubi still has to smooth out some of its launch flaws.  (A few of the missions so far have very clearly not been playtested, and these usually get fixed in the first couple months if I recall.)\n\nAnd if you're new to Assassin's Creed, go ahead and buy an earlier, cheaper entry into the franchise to see if you like it as much as those youtube videos.  Most of these games, being annual episodes of a not-quite-cohesive storyline, are pretty similar to one another by now.  Unimaginative purists will shriek about their sacred assassins not being pirates, but basically if you like pirates I recommend Black Flag.  If you like not-pirates, I recommend Unity.  And if Unity's not cheap enough, I still have a soft spot for AC2 / Brotherhood, but just note that those are pretty dated titles.","November 21, 2015","true","51.6"," 49 of 67 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","49","67","4","1"

The Victorian era is one of my favorite historical settings and AC's London does it justice. Even if the story ends up being terrible (it's fine so far, and has a decent amount of humor to boot), the city is magnificent and I'm really impressed with the number of moving parts--boats, carriages, trains, factory machinery, and so forth.\n\nImportant note: if you have a graphics card with only 2 GB VRAM (I have a 2 GB Nvidia 960), it might be worth your while to try going over the memory threshold shown on the graphics options screen. When I tried this with GTA V, the game stuttered, but when I try this with AC: Syndicate, the game shrugs and says "Eh, why not." Of course there are limits, but with a little experimentation I was able to get the game to run very smoothly and still show textures that aren't blurry messes (which they are on Low). Maybe Ubisoft sandbagged it a little to avoid a deluge of complaints. Whatever the reason, it's worth fiddling with the settings.\n\nEdit: Additional technical info: playing at 1920x1080, Intel i7-4790K @ 4 GHz.\n\nUpdated info after 70 hours: Well, I'm getting close to finishing the story missions and everything I said above still holds. Since I've already said plenty of nice stuff about the game, here I would like to point out a few nitpicks.\n\nMuted outfit colors: The in-game outfit artwork shows vivid reds and dark blacks, but the actual colors you can use with your outfit are toned down. This is the Victorian era, friends, let us get fancy.\n\nHelix credits: I don't mind paying for good DLC, but Helix credits seem like a raw deal, particularly since they only buy things that should be covered by difficulty sliders. It's as though you bought a calculator but had to pay extra to use the trig functions. It wouldn't be so bad if you got a lot of them for a couple bucks, I guess, but these prices are eye-popping and jaw-dropping. So I haven't bought any.\n\nMission glitch: I found one mission (going slumming, literally, with a wealthy lady) would not complete properly for me--the game would freeze with a perpetual "saving" icon when the mission ended. It turns out you need to get her home before she stops talking. Easy enough to get around once you look up a workaround on the Internet, but it really should work properly.\n\nTypefaces: Overall, the typefaces you'll see on in-game signage are what you'd want and expect, but there are a couple signs in there that were apparently designed in Microsoft Word using whatever font was handy, and whenever I see one it's like finding a 1979 penny in my pocket and being rudely yanked back into modernity.\n\nStill, it's a great game all in all.\n\nUpdate after 82 hours: There is a really annoying bug on replays of kidnapping and Templar hunting missions: the game may fail the mission immediately after loading it. Then it will reload, and maybe it will work or maybe it will fail again. It seems to load properly eventually, but I've seen it reload 4 or 5 times before working. Annoying. Then again this is the first Assassin's Creed game where I've been motivated to go back and replay missions to complete all the side requirements, so I guess I'll just have to hope they patch it.","November 19, 2015","true","99.5"," 61 of 88 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","61","88","3","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/volt615/recommended/368500/","volt615","Volt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/volt615/","405 products in account","Assassin's Creed SyndicateSyndicate is another Assassin's Creed game set in 19th century London.  I say another because not much has changed from the previous titles.  You get a third-person action-adventure RPG with the same basic fighting skills and controls as any other Assassin's Creed game.  What does Syndicate give you?  A step back on a new engine.\n\nWhat's ImprovedSyndicate is designed on the same engine as Unity and looks very much the same as Unity did last year only without the poorly opimized gameplay Unity had upon release (fixed four months later).  You get a new gadget to play with early on in the game, the grappling attachment to the assassin's blade.  Syndicate also takes a step back to older styled combat after fans complained that Unity was overly simplified which provides a steeper challenge, especially if you wander into an area a few levels higher.\n\nWhat's UnimprovedI found navagating the city worse than Unity.  Unity for the most part was very decent except trying to jump off a fence or going into a window.  Syndicate's controls with a keyboard and mouse are worse. I can be climbing and trying to shimmy right with the "D" key pressed and Jacob shimmys left!  In just over 12 hours of gameplay, I have had this happen several times while trying to navigate support beams under bridges and the train stations.\n\nAnother area I found disappointing was the lack of stats on gear choices that Unity introduced.  I rather enjoyed having so many options to load my character up with to attempt a stealth vs full on kill everything mission.  Syndicate takes another step back to the quest rewards and crafting gear with very limited options other than those found on outfits.\n\nCo-OpOne aspect of Unity I really enjoyed was the Co-Op club activities I played with my 12 year old son.  We had a blast and as a result I have over two hundred hours in Unity which is double what I have in any other AC game and up to 5 times what I have in the older AC titles.  I was very disappointed that the Co-Op club activities were abandoned in Syndicate this time around as I found that to be one of the most redeeming qualities of Unity.\n\nThe StoryThe story is good, not great.  It is the familar obtain the pieces of eden at any cost from or before the templars use them to destory the world with corrupt power. The best part of the sotry is that you get to play as two people.  The interaction between the twins (Jacob & Evie) really help to push the story along and make it fun. For the most part you can choose who you want to play with the exception of the story line which will force you to play one or the other at times.\n\nGraphicsGraphically Syndicate looks as great as Unity did, maybe just a bit better.  The engine runs smooth although the system requirements are extremely steep.  Running triple SLI with 3x gtx 980s my frame rate will take a hit with everything on max settings but that may be in part due to a lack of sli support.  On a good note, the game still looks great on lower/mid cards such as a gtx 960 on low settings. Syndicate definitely looks better than Unity did on low settings.\n\nProsBetter combat\nBetter optimized graphics\nFun interaction between twin characters\n\nConsControls are worse\nNo Co-Op club activities\nLimited stats to build your character\n\nRecommendationI was very disappointed in the absence of the Co-Op club activities, the poor control issues, and the lack of stats on gear for character custimization.  But in the end Syndicate does provide that very familar AC game experience if not over familar.  Syndicate is ejoyable although do not expect to spend several hundred hours in this title like you may have with AC IV Black Flag, AC Rogue, or AC Unity.  The content of ship battles, exploration, and Co-Op activities are just not there.","November 20, 2015","true","104.5"," 41 of 57 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","41","57","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/368500/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","TL;DR Version:\nPros:\n+ Better optimized than Unity when it launched. However, Syndicate is on par with post-patched Unity.\n+ While not a primary focus, there is an actual modern day story, complete with cutscenes. Unlike Unity.\n+ London is an awesome place to explore. The zip-line upgrade really takes away some of the frustration and slowness of climbing the immense structures.\n+ Upgrades and crafting are included here, as they were in Unity.\n+ Horsedrawn Carriages are fun to drive around.\n+ No Initiates, No Companion App. Microtransactions are still here, but they are optional and mostly worthless. However, they can help those who do not have a lot of time/patience for gathering crafting resources or in-game currency.\n+ A new leveling system that includes three distinct skill trees. You can customize both characters, but with the amount of skill tree points you get, the characters do not vary much in the end.\n+ Radically different side missions than in any of the other titles.\n+ A lot of famous historical characters to meet and complete missions for.\n\nCons:\n- Bland main characters in comparison to the rest of the Assassin's Creed franchise. It would've been best if Ubisoft continued to focus on building just one character up. The Templars and historical characters are more interesting than the main ones.\n- Bland split storylines. Jacob will be out for blood, while Evie wants to find Pieces of Eden. There are two separate storylines running all the time, but neither of them come across as fulfilling or in-depth.\n- Still not as optimized of a game as it should be.\n\nLong Version\nAfter the fiasco that was Unity, I openly boycotted Ubisoft. As such, I didn't preorder Syndicate. After reading reviews that stated that this game was better optimized than Unity, I dropped my boycott and bought Syndicate. In my personal experience, the optimization in Syndicate is on par with post-patched Unity. With settings on full ultra, minus Gameworks, I average 40-50 FPS in open world London, but get horrendous FPS tears that drag me down to 10-17 FPS out of nowhere. Specs in profile. I may need more RAM.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's focus on the game itself. When it came to story and gameplay, I loved Unity (once they removed the Companion App and Initiates). In fact, Unity replaced the Ezio trilogy as my favorite AC game thus far. I found that Arno and Elise were characters with great depth. Unfortunately, I don't feel that Jacob and Evie live up to any prior assassins. Ubisoft have taken the polar opposite elements of assassins, battle and stealth, and divided them up into two separate characters; Jacob is best at combat, while Evie is best at stealth. In doing so, they've also divided the story; Jacob is out for blood, while Evie is focused on finding Pieces of Eden.\n\nIn dividing the game, plot, story, and characters this way, Ubisoft have failed to create two intensely interesting characters and instead settled for two mediocre ones. I thought that I would really love Jacob and his sarcasm, and Evie and her intelligent wit, but they both come off rather bland and two dimensional. As well, instead of one really great storyline, you get two that are as equally as disappointing and not as strong as they would be if Ubisoft had just focused on one main character and one main story.\n\nSyndicate plays mostly the same as Unity since it's on the same engine, but the controls are back to that of Black Flag and Rogue. There's a crafting system to craft upgrades to carry more medicine, darts, ammo, etc., and also for weapons, armor and outfits. There's a newly introduced zip-line upgrade that lets you scale tall buildings in a single bound, which is a great time saver.\n\nThe side missions are entirely unique to Syndicate, you'll be liberating child slaves, hunting Templars, taking over gang headquarters, competing in carriage races and more. The main missions themselves are also fun and fairly innovative for the series, although since the story is so underwhelming they're not as satisfying to complete.\n\nOverall, I do recommend Syndicate. Above all, the game actually works, London is a fun place to explore, and Ubisoft have actually integrated some awesome ideas into the game. It's just a shame that the main characters and dual storylines are lackluster. I found myself more drawn in by side characters such as Henry Green; I kinda hope we get a spin-off title for him, like Freedom Cry for Adawale.\n\nRating: 4.5/5.0 - Excellent, highly worth playing.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","November 24, 2015","true","28.2"," 30 of 40 people (75%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","75","30","40","4","3"

Without doing those two things you may run into issues that myself and others have ran into which range from buildings not appearing, graphical glitches everywhere, some textures looking like it's straight up Missingno from Pokemon. However with the drivers + no MFAA the game runs flawlessly!\n\nI guess since this is a review I should also add in my general early thoughts (2 hours in). The game itself feels like a step forward in terms of art design and the way it handles side quests. Opening up a map doesn't seem overwhelming anymore. You just have 5 or 6 clear objectives in every section of the map. It's not 1000+ little collectibles marked all over. The pacing is on point. The story is also quite good so far, I especially love the skill tree added in. Gameplay wise it seems to be a step back. Unity went for a more open ended mission structure (Syndicate could still go this way considering how early into the game I'm in) where you were given a target and a general location and all you had to do was figure out a way to kill the target. This one seems to lead you down a direct path to your targets leaving little creativity to how you dispose of targets (So AC1-4 style). It also feels like the combat is a step back. It's a counter fest again. So if you're down with the old gameplay style for another entry then it's fine.

When you think London in the middle of 1868, London is in the middle industrial revolution and it is only 75 years away from French revolution. However it feels like a thousand years has passed, because it completely changes people how they live.\n\n\nStory  Introducing two main protagonists, Jacob and Evie, they will fight back free up London using their street gangs. Jacob and Evie have to gather people to take down the Templars.\nI won’t spoil the story but I can tell you that you’ll learn many of historical stories which are a lot more interesting than your school.  Starring Charles Darwin, Karl Max, Alexander Graham bell, Queen Victoria and many more Syndicate manages to deliver a cohesive and satisfying tale.\n\n\nGameplay  The gameplay has been polished a lot, seems like the developer has learned a lot from the previous series.\n\n\nCombat\nIn Syndicate, developers also revamp the combat system. Back then, London, in 1868, is the time of concealed weapon. Back in the time, 70 years before was Medieval time period. Weapon was to have a sword, axe, and etc. But now in London 1868, London is not possible to do that. Therefore the combat is more to street combat style where everything has been brought into close quarters. Syndicate focuses on melee combat, with Jacob and his street gang pulling enemies into fist fights on the city streets. Combat is no less brutal than in previous games, but bringing fights between you and your enemies closer allows for some seriously cool-looking cinematic kills. They are faster and more brutal than ever. Thanks to weapons like the brass knuckles.\n\nCountering, Chain kills, Double kills, Enemy shields, Disarming, Hiring, Cinematic kills, Weapon toss, Variety of projectiles, and etc have been brought back. But, combat using the hidden blade like in Assassin Creed 2 or brotherhood has not been brought back. It’s only being used for the finishing move.\n\nNavigation\nLondon buildings are taller and wider than any features in the series before.  Syndicate introduces the rope launcher (a tool that probably the game changer of the game), which lets Jacob and Evie rapidly ascend to high ledges and create ziplines across wide gaps to help them quickly get around these larger spaces. Player can use it almost in any building that they want.\n\nThe way how you switch your character is just like GTA V, you can freely switch whenever you want from the Menu. You are in open world; it is your choice to play whether you want to play as Jacob or Evie. However, within the main sequences/chapters, whichever you want to refer to, this world will alternate between the two depending on the story what you want to tell. In addition, what make it more fun is the perks/upgrades is different within each other.\n\nStealth\nWhistling is also back, is just as useful as ever, as we found when we used it to lure a gang member to our hiding spot for a quick, clean kill from cover.\nThe Hood toggle works beautifully. While you are in the stealth mode you will always have your hood on. When you are walk freely or not in the stealth mode, you can have your hood away.\n\nVehicle\nThis is the big part of Syndicate. Thinking of London in 1868, London has “The Carriage”. The player can steal the vehicle and even hijack it. Player also can ride on it; hide in it and even fight on the top. The carriage is a powerful tool for the player to navigate freely. But be aware that enemy can also use it to against you.\n\nStreet Gang\nJust almost like in Brotherhood series where you can hire your Assassins brotherhood. Instead of that, in Syndicate you can hire your gang to fight with you.\n\n\nGraphic  As you explore the magnificence of London city in the 19 Century, it makes you want to pack up your stuffs immediately and fly to London. Sky-high towers, stone walkways line the financial center, galloping horse carriage, red-box telephone, homeless burn fires in trash cans in alleys, stations bustle with passengers and passing trains, London feels alive. It’s breath-taking.\n\nThe character design is really sharp. Looking at the white silky smooth beard of Charles Darwin in the highly detailed graphic makes you want to try to pull his beard or burn it.\n\nThe lighting in this game is absolutely amazing. Everything looks believable, they are using HDR effect to slowly blend in the darker place to the brighter place; you can see from indoor to outdoor, the outdoor is very bright. As you are going out, the brightness will slowly blend in to normal brightness. In other hand, from brighter place to darker place, you can from outdoor to indoor; the room started with very dark lighting and slowly blends in to normal brightness. Honestly, this is one of best looking open-world; everything looks amazing, the buildings, the shadow, the texture, the detail, are astounding.\n\n\nSound System  Talking about music, because in Assassins Creed 3 the music was almost dead all the time. In Syndicate, as player move throughout the city, you will hear different ambient music. For instance, in the street you could hear people playing violin, or, if you are in the pop music place, you could hear pop music. It is really nice to have this idea in the game because it reflexes different feeling where you are in. Thanks to Austin Wintory, a great grammy-nominated Journey composer for creating awesome music background for Syndicate. You are not far from Jesper Kyd.\n\n\nReplayability   Both the story missions and the open-world activities work better than previous series. It isn’t perfect, but with such a beautiful city, a genuinely likeable cast of characters, and many improvements to both stealth and combat this feels like a step in the right direction for Assassin’s Creed. You can stick with this game for hundreds of hours to finish it on 100% sync memories.\n\n\nProblems  1.	Some random crash and freeze screen sometimes happens.\n2.	To running on 60 fps with everything on maximum setting, you really need strong pc specs. Even if you are running on GTX 970 or AMD R9 380 GPU with core i5 6600K CPU, you probably still need to struggle lowering down the display setting.\nTaking core i7 is highly recommended and gets the higher GPU probably.\n3.	Currently SLI is not that beneficial.\n\nHopefully they will release next patch soon to fix all the problems.","February 3","true","28.7"," 28 of 37 people (76%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","76","28","37","7","0"

I like it a lot. The main characters are great and London looks great. My only gripe is that some textures, bricks for instance, look better on some buidlings than others which is odd. If everything had the same texture clarity i think it would look better (even if it is a little blurry). Anyway, if you like Assassin's Creed this is a great game. This is, of course, just my experience and it does seem like some others are having some issues, but I just wanted to throw in my two cents worth. Honestly, I have been able to run Unity day one and Arkham Knight day one on this laptop (it never fails to impress me how much it can do), so maybe I am just a lucky guy. I am sure a lot of small issues wil be fixed with the inevitable Nvidia graphics driver that'll come out later today (hopefully this helps people with there problems). Anyway, back to my positives again, I like this game a lot so far and it runs far better on day one than Unity ever did.\n\nEdit: I've fiddled around a bit and got it to run at 1080p with low everything, FXAA and maintain around 35FPS is anyone is curious","November 18, 2015","true","50.4"," 107 of 177 people (60%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","60","107","177","10","22"

The story that normally takes place in the "real world", as in out of the animus, is entirely cut scenes and uncontrollable.

It's honestly difficult to blend in, the mechanic doesnt work well.\n\nEverything in the story is predictable and boring and you play two characters who are as deep as paper.\n\nThe typical assassins creed glitches are infuriating.\n\nThe home base, which you normally build up, is automatically updated and renovated after some missions.

But I wish I didn't buy it. Not worth it.\n\nNo puzzles of any difficulty, no stealth of any difficulty, no combat of any difficulty.

Is it perfect, no but It Is definitely way better then last years launch and a successful entry into the Assassin's Creed Franchise.\n\nThis time around you get to play as two assassin's named Jacob and Evie who are twin brother and sister, and the location of the game is London during the Industrial Revolution, the story has some really good moments between the two being both funny and emotional, Jacob and Evie do tend to fight alot as they both have their own objectives to pursue and different ways of doing so, Jacob is more brash and likes to rush in and just fight and blow things up, while Evie is more smart and stealthly in her approach. The Templar this time around is Crawford Starrick who is the owner of Starrick Industries and the Grand Master of the British Rite of the Templar Order. I loved his personally as he reminded me alot of Charles Lee from Assassin's Creed III, he has great lines in the story and is also good at the piano as one scene shows. Also there are so many Historical Figures in this game, Charles Dickens, Karl Marx, Charles Darwin, Queen Victoria and even Alexander Graham Bell and they all work well in the story.\n\nLondon is absolutely huge and has so many things to do in it, from the so many collectibles like Chests, Secrets Of London, Royal Letters, Beer Brands and Historical Posters to the Conquest Activities like Gang Wars, Bounty Hunts, Child Liberations and Gang Strongholds. The games parkour system has also been improved on since last year and you have a new Rope Launcher which makes travelling from building to building a breeze, there is also Horse and Carriages that you can even race with or just use to get around with. There is also tons of customization with your Outfit, Weapons, Assassin's Gauntlets, Pistols and so much more.\n\nNow for the Technical side of things, yes this game runs alot better then last years game and It looks very beautiful too, however to get a mostly good experience which for me was 60FPS! at 1080p with a few FPS drops here and there for most if not all the time, you will have to turn Gameworks off, It shouldn't be in the game because simply it does not work well at all, secondly turn your Anti Alising down to MSAA 2X + FXAA, I could not use TXAA because It Is part of Gameworks and MSAA 4X + FXAA was simply killing my FPS which annoyed me because I didn't understand why at 1080P using a GTX 980 Ti the game could not keep a 60FPS on that setting, I don't know if it is the fact that the game is demanding or is that setting badly optimized, but everything else was on Ultra, I just wish that the settings put in the game actually worked, why bother puting them in there if they don't.\n\nOverall I enjoyed Assassin's Creed Syndicate, the game did run alot better then Assassin's Creed Unity, the game looks beautiful, the story and characters were really interesting, the soundtrack to the game is beautiful and well done, and the gameplay in general is quite smooth and there is plenty of customization. I would recommend it to you but just play around with the Graphical settings to see what works best for you and keep Gameworks off.","December 26, 2015","true","74.7"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","20","24","2","1"

This game is so much enjoyable. There are so much things to do in it's super amazing open world. Full of awesome side quest activities itself. After a long time A real Assassin's Creed title released between us. Finally Assassin's Creed is back with an masterpiece. Well, the comeback was definately real. In Assassin's Creed, Ezio Auditore was my most favorite hero. He was a real legend. I really miss him badly. But the incoming of Jacob Frye, just filled up the lacking for Ezio Auditore. Now Jacob Frye is my most favorite hero. He looks damn cool and handsome. Specialy with Edward's outfit. That really suits him. I just love his personality.\n\nWell, developers worked really so hard for it's open world. It's open world seems too big for roaming and riding. They putted the whole London in this. Detailed every buildings, vehicles, obstackles, environment. The environment feels damn fabulous. Just a real feel of Victorian Era. Specialy at night, the city with only golden lights feels remarkable and heart touching. Well this was something. When i reach at the top of the Big Ben, i can see the whole city with just golden neons. So much beautiful. The designed Big Ben amazingly. Just looks like genuine one. Well that was my dream to see London at night from the top of the Big Ben.\n\nThat feels really incredible that Assassin's Creed appeared the era of machines and technology. The generation begins here. Great to see trains in this game. Epic show begins now. Too much actions on the rooftop of the train. Feels much more than epic.\n\nIn those early games of Assassin's Creed, our hideout was in buildings. But in Assassin's Creed Syndicate, our hideout is in the train. This is too unique as hell. I really do appreciate them for their new unique thoughts. Well, there is many more things to be explored. This is much more than i expected from them.\n\nCombating seems really enjoyable. They featured many types of skills for better striking. well they also featured a new system of upgrading your skill level by gaining XP. This is gonna make your gameplay more interesting and cool.\n\nThey featured too many rewards for us. You can unlock them by completing it's ruquirements tasks as they have mentioned. Rewards like Brace Knucles, Cane Sword, Belt Designs, Gauntlet Blade Designs, Outfits, Crafting Meterials, Colors for your outfit, Capes for Evie and many more things to unlock.\n\nYou can buy extra things from E- Store for your better gameplay. Like for Assassins and Gang Members, You can say Rooks. You need Helix points to buy from E- Store. Well, it is really hard to earn Helix points\n\nOptimization of it's seems pretty well. But you cant say perfect. I am getting FPS drop for few times. Like on Daylight site and Crowd areas. But it's not gonna make it bad. It's not so much bad as you are thinking. It's good. My configuration is Intel Core i5 4690K, RAM 8GB DDR3, R9 Vapor-X 290 4GB GDDR5 and um playing on Ultra High settings. Getting cool FPS. Locked at 60 FPS. CPU usage stays normal as usual. Nothing happening bad.\n\nIf you ask me about bugs, i would love to say that Assassin's Creed Syndicate is totally fresh and clean masterpiece. I didn't get any kind of bugs yet. No Bugs, No errors, No Stuttering, No crashes. Just a perfect game.\n\nPros :::\n1. Good optimization\n2. Amazing story with epic ending\n3. Excellent and incredible open world\n4. Full of side quest activities\n5. Ultimate herous like Jacob Frye and Evie Frye\n6. Highly detailed and polished open world interior and exterior\n7. A super amazing game without any kind of bugs\n8. Such fabulous and epic skills for Combating.\n9. Super excellent and mind blowing graphics quality, just realistic\n10. Perfect perkour\n\nCons :::\n1. Controlling system just sucks. So hard to free run.\n2. Adjustment of settings isn't highly featured for better experience on gaming.\n3. Full of crashes.\n\nNow, it's time to rate this game,\nGameplay : 10/10\nAction : 10/10\nCombat : 10/10\nGraphics Quality : 10/10\nControlling System : 2/10\nSoundtracks : 5/10\nStory : 10/10\nProtagonists : 10/10\nCharacters : 10/10\nAtmospheric : 10/10\nOpen World/Perkour : 10/10\nOptimization : 4/10\nSo they should have set soundtracks better, maching with gameplay atmospheres. Those are boring for me, but as they are victorian theme so no hard feelings. But controlling for free run down and up really sucks. It's too much disturbing to jump to next place and climb up. I need to press pretty much times like Shift+W+E. Shift+W+E, this way for free run down just ♥♥♥♥ed me up.\nAnyway Assassin's Creed Syndicate is my second best and perfect game for me in this year. Well first is Life is Strange. Just finished the whole game for second time. Ending is really epic and outstanding. I have to say that Assassin's Creed Syndicate is one of the best games of Assassin's Creed series. Gonna vote it for Game of the Year. UBi, This game is nothing but mind blowing and masterpiece.

Set within London in 1868 during the Industrial Revolution, the story follows twins Jacob and Evie Frye as they navigate the corridors of organized crime during the Victorian era and fight against the established order, controlled by the Templars. The game retains the series' third-person open world exploration as well as introducing new traveling systems and refined combat and stealth mechanics. Unlike its direct predecessors but like the first two main games in the series, Syndicate does not feature any multiplayer gameplay. Assassin's Creed Syndicate marks the first time in the series where you can freely switch between two different protagonists. It is also the first main entry in the series to feature a playable female protagonist. Male lead Jacob Frye is meant to be more of a hot-headed brawler, specialized in close combat, while his twin sister Evie is strong in stealth and relies on her intelligence and wit. The Assassins' main weapons this time around include brass knuckles, a compact revolver, a cane sword and the traditional Nepalese curved kukri knife and combat is faster-paced than before. Additionally new travelling systems make their debut in the game, such as a rope launcher which allows the you to rappel up structures as well as create a zip-line between buildings, and carriages, which can all be piloted or simply occupied by you, and trains. London in the game is approximately 30% larger than Paris in Unity and consist of seven boroughs: Westminster, the Strand, the City of London, Whitechapel, the Thames, Southwark and Lambeth. Overall I think Assassin's Creed Syndicate is a massive improvement and perhaps the best AC game since AC II not just because of the gameplay and the story, but also the port. It runs very smoothly and the graphics are just beautiful, I suggest you play around with the settings to get the best performance possible. It hardly has any game breaking bugs or glitches that can prevent you from being able to complete certain missions. If your getting an AC game I suggest you go for this as it will absolutely blow you away without a single doubt at all!.","November 25, 2015","true","227.7"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","23","31","5","1"

Very enjoyable if you ask me.\n\nEdit:- I've finished the main story and added more info in story and characters, gameplay and present day  section.\n\nReview:\nPerformance:-\n\nAh, everyone's interested in this after Unity fiasco. I can assure you while this is not a super glorious port like Gta V, Mad max or MgsV, this game runs much better and smoother than Unity. My current setup i5 3450, Gtx 660 and 8gb ram. I'm getting 35-45fps in open world with textures set to high, all settings to low, fxaa and vsync is off at 1080p. At same settings I got 20-30fps in Unity and also lots of stuttering, freezes and framedrops which is not very common in Syndicate.\n\nFor all those folks getting bad performance, a word of advice : turn down gameworks. Pcss ultra is a performance killer which takes like 20-25fps alone compared to high/medium shadows. Hbao+ is kinda ok, but txaa tanks performance as well. Do this and you won't have any problems of having 40fps etc. on 980ti or similar killer rigs.\n\nStory and Characters :-\n\nMy favorite aspect in games in general and my most likable part in this game. The story is quite good but the thing that I love most is the light hearted tone. The interaction of Jacob and Evie are enjoyable to watch as they behave like real brothes and sister. There are a lot of jokes in the game, for example when the last assassin of London(won't spoil his name) says about a templer, "He is known to vanish before your very eyes",  Jacob says, "Shall we make him vanish for real?" I'm still at sequence 3, so I can't give you impressions about other intricate things but will update the review later. There are lot of interesting historical characters you'll meet. I think you know the names of already from the historical characters trailer of this game.\n\nEdit:- The story is much, much better than Unity. Although at times, it might feel like something is left to be desired. The ending was quite nice too. I'd love more games on the twins and Henry.\n\nGameplay and Combat :-\n\nThis is what people always complain about being the same. I can't deny that it does not change much but if that happened it won't remain assassin's creed anymore. In this game the gameplay defining changes include the rope launcher. It's not like just cause's grappling hook. It works like batman's grapple in arkham games except that this one can be used as zipline for building to building traversal as well. It does not take away from parkour but it actually complements in nicely. Great addition, if you ask me.\n\nCombat system is one of the things that like. It's fast and brutal and feels fun unlike clunky and slow combat of Unity. However to some people, it might feel like button mashing or being too fast. You can't change weapons mid combat. Weapons work like outfits as you have to assign one in inventory. No hidden blade combat is there.\n\nNow to stealth. Cover system is better than Unity. It's a soft cover system as opposed to Unity's hard cover. The crouching mode and change to hood is considered annoying by some, but I don't mind it. Hoods made sense in AC1 because it was needed to blend in with scholars who also wore hoods. Since then, for once, we are using proper clothing to blend in which actually makes sense.\n\nCrowd events are present just like Unity. Crowds are thinner. Even though it was done to help the performance, it makes sense historically as there was no revolution in London. So there was no need for people to flock the streets.\n\nCarriages are a good addition too. Mobile hiding spot, fast way to reach places, a great tool to fight enemies as well. It does not handle perfectly but you will get used to it.\n\nEdit:- Two switchable characters with 3 unique skills for each really freshens up gameplay. Adds some replayability as well.\n\nThe assassinations are much enjoyable this time. Each one providing stealth opportunity, assistance opportunity to better infiltrate the targets as well as providing an unique kill option, fulfilling all of its conditions will reward you with a cutscene of the assassination.\n\nPresent day:-\n\nThe modern day story, hated by some people but to me,  it's one of the most important aspects of the series that differentiates it from other open world games and holds the games together. I have both good and bad news for the present day fans. Bad news is, it's still cutscenes only. Good news is, it moves the story foward unlike Unity. There are cutscenes after a number of sequences and they are all action packed unlike Unity where you just listen to Bishop talking. Overall it's enjoyable.\n\nEdit:- The ending was badass. There is a epic fight scene. The ending left me hyped for ac 2016,  almost a cliffhanger, if you ask me.\n\nBugs and glitches:-\n\nIn my 4 hours in the game, I encountered one glitch. In a cutscene, I got the invisible character glitch, I could hear them talking, feel them moving but except Jacob, the character model of other 2 characters wasn't showing up. And in an another cutscene, I got a framedrop to 10 fps. These are the only issues I faced so far.\n\nConclusion\nIf you are a dedicated fan, definitely buy it. Even with a sub par performance, I'm loving this game. If you are not, then buy it if you have a good mid range righ at least, something like 960 or so. 4gb vram is recommended but not mandatory. The game is really good and enjoyable. It's the fresh wind ac needs to bring back it's glory after the fiasco of Unity.","November 20, 2015","true","67.7"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","23","31","0","5"

There are no more swords. Not a lot of customization to the characters compared to the rest of the games. There was even an option to buy IG money. THIS IS A SINGLE PLAYER GAME WHY DO I NEED TO BUY MONEY. :l\n\n~Edit~\n\nSince quite a few people actually took a look at my review I feel like I should explain a bit more as to what I stated above.\n\n-Regarding the backstory for the characters, it just felt very rushed compared to other AC games. You jump right into the action with both characters, and with previous AC games, it was not like that whatsoever. Some people might've liked this fast pace change, and I'm sure (maybe) that you learned a bit more about the characters throughout the game, but in my -short- time of playing, I only got a taste of there witty banter towards each other and others.\n\n-I should also throw in, whilst it does say that the two characters have preferred roles (one a brawler and the other more stealth oriented), I didn't feel that difference at all.\n\n-On weapons and equipment, it makes complete sense (excluding the obvious assassin equipment) for the time period. Ubisoft did a good job with that. It's just that the combat with the weapons given to us were just unimpressive, again, compared to the previous AC games. I'm an assassin with access to a vast amount of weapons, so why are my only options a khukri, a cane sword, and some gauntlets? The additions of having a pistol wasn't that bad, however.\n\n-There was a severe lacking of outfits that you could obtain (comparing it from the last game), but I guess something to keep in mind is that you're also playing with two characters. Managing both of the characters loadouts just became ennoying. Now, you can purchase some more outfits as a DLC... :l\n\n-I think the fact that Ubisoft has a feature to buy IG money (I don't know if this has changed) is a bit poor, considering that this is a singleplayer game.\n\nDo I recommend this game at full price? No. Do I recommend it if it ever goes on sale? Yes.\n\nBecause whilst I do address some issues about this game, Ubisoft really tried and suceeded to give us a better game from AC Unity. It still feels like an AC game. The combat is still fun. (it however felt better in Unity, refer to my statement about weapons). It still has -some- interesting story to get invested in. It's an alright game. I'd like to say I interested to see what Ubisoft has in store for us for the franchise in the future, but I'd rather much prefer that they take there time on the next one. (We got a spoiler about Syndicate nearly a month after Unity, whilst there was still issues being patched on Unity. :l)","November 24, 2015","false","3.1"," 112 of 195 people (57%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","57","112","195","6","0"

Yes, London is big, but that's it really. 6 hours in, and I've conquered 1/4th of London, and am just starting on the last row of skills.\n\nThe grappling is great.\n\nCombat is fine.\n\nEvie and Jacob have almost the exact same skill trees, except for 3 skills each the other doesn't. I've basically built the two the exact same.\n\nThe interplay between the two is great, even if it's very much a caricature (Jacob is the simple man, Evie is the more thoughtful woman, etc). As the two are essentially the same in terms of play, I just play Evie except for the occaisional mission in which you have to use Jacob.\n\nThis is the first Assassin's Creed that injects some humor throughout. It's a nice touch, and a nice break from the traditional seriousness of the franchise.\n\nI hate the train. :D It's so damn slow. Get those fast travel points as soon as you can.\n\nDifficulty wise, this is probably the easiest AC yet, though that seems to partly be due to overleveling, and even a level's difference in a fight has a large effect.\n\nMy gang is overleveled too, I guess. I don't really use them unless the story throws them into the fray on its own, and in those moments, my gang basically kills everything in a matter of seconds. :/\n\nOverall, I'm enjoying it. Largely in part to the two main characters; I just enjoy the two of them. Haven't really enjoyed the main character in an AC game since the (younger) Ezio days. We've had some gawd awful AC protagonists since then (bottoming out with Connor). Jacob and Evie are a refreshing change.\n\nOnly had one crash. Was transitioning from the map back to the game, and it just froze in an all white screen. The only weird issue I encountered was when I was in a kidnap mission, everytime I restrained my victim, an invisible wall would spring up, preventing me from walking forward (and, in fact, would push me backwards). I got around that by facing in the opposite direction I wanted to walk, waited for the victim to try to break free, restrained victim, and then turned around and walked. It's only occurred the one time in a kidnapping mission. All the others I've done had no issues.\n\nOverall technical side of the port seems great.\n\nParkor controls are just as good (and bad) as always.\n\nAt this point in the game, I'd give it a 9/10. They haven't really done much to change the AC formula, but after a long string of ACs that I didn't particularly enjoy (from a characters/story perspective), this has been a fun ride so far. It might be coloring my opinion a bit, and it's quite possible that once this initial euphoria of actually enjoying an AC story/characters again fades, I'd really be around an 8/10.","November 19, 2015","true","31.3"," 34 of 53 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","34","53","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MUGARO/recommended/368500/","MUGARO","418","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MUGARO/","253 products in account","TL;DR Damn close to 10/10, possibly my new favorite in the AC series\nI was very critical of Unity.  The story was unfocused, Arno had very little character development and just felt like an Ezio copy.  The gameplay was changed for the worse, I only remember 3 characters (including the main playable) and it was too crowded.\n\nSyndicate feels like a true AC game, better than the Ezio trilogy.  The best part is having two characters makes for more to go off of for them.  Jacob is a fighter & takes the most action, but his weakness is that he causes the most chaos.  Evie is the stealth character that is much smarter & applies critical thinking to situations, but at times doesn't take enough action to help out.  Having the character flaws isn't bad, they both make up for it with a yin/yang mix as twins.\n\nThe villains this time are FAR more memorable.  Each character got so much more development and much better blue screen deaths than in the past.  Having each character's role outlined (ie: the banker, the scientist, the doctor, the transporter, etc) makes their missions, motives, character traits far more memorable.\n\nThe actual assassination missions were the best.  Not since AC1 have I looked forward to actual Templar assassinations, but that was because AC1 had ♥♥♥♥♥♥ gameplay elsewhere other than the assassinations.\n\nThe music is incredible, by far the best since AC2 & Brotherhood's soundtrack but actually I'd say even better.\n\nHere are my complaints:\n\n-At the beginning, the Mentor named George lectures the twins about staying away from London.  They disobey him and he's never heard from again.  I was expecting him to show up in sequence 4 or 5 with his monacle broken & jowels flapping.  I was disappointed.\n\n-The main villain, Crawford Starrick, is a really good presence & very well acted.  However, literally every scene but the final sequence has him in his office assigning other people to do dirty work.  He never does any actual fieldwork or has any interaction with them face to face.  Granted, you can say "Well, London was completely under his control so he didn't need to leave his office", but tha'ts weak.\n\n-The sidequests have very little payoff.  I only did them for fun.  Hell, I cleared out a huge chunk of chests & collectibles for fun, but that was just me enjoying the game.  There really is no actual payoff to it unless if I was achievement hunting, which I'm not on Ubiplay garbage.\n\nAnyway, great game, worth the $20 I spent it on.  Hope the one in 2017 is even better.","April 11","true","33.4"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

After ACIII, I became completely desinterested in this series, yet I somehow continued playing it. After slugging through Unity (on PS4 no less), I was done... then ACS was on sale very short after release and the reviews said, the game is not that bad...\n\nWell, for the first few hours, it isn't. It's quite competent. It looks really nice, runs well, if you have the PC that can run it, plays a bit better than the games before it in the series. But then you get into the completely pointless story, that doesn't engage you in any way. Cardboard cutouts of characters interacting with each other to no point. A shoehorned love plot, that has not earned its right to be in the game (suddenly one main character has feelings for another guy... but we're not shown why or how it happened. It just happens).\n\nThe main story arc can be explained in maybe two minutes. The rest is filler. There's no twists, no turns. Just "kill that guy" and find the MacGuffin. Nothing else... but it's stretched to a good 10 to 20 hours (if you focus on the story).\n\nThe last two or three memories are THE worst, though. Suddenly, you get contacted by some guy... that sort of wants to play a game with you and your enemies. It's 4 missions, or so, of complete filler, with mission designs directly lifted from the open world ♥♥♥♥ you're tasked to do to free London anyways. And in the end, he "betrays you" and you kill him. Completely out of the blue. No real connection to the rest of the game. Seems like it was supposed to be DLC, but it wasn't good enough to sell on its own, so it was boxed with the game.\n\nAnd climax makes you play f*cking GTA taxi missions, for gods sake. And for what? Some irrelevanat dialogue of a guy you only met once before and you'll never meet again, about stuff that doesn't matter in the game at all. Only for him to give you some plans.\n\nSome missions forbid you to do the stuff you do all the time... like kill people. Why? Doesn't tell you... in some missions, it doesn't even tell you that, beforehand. You just fail, if you kill... only then you know. Some "additional mission incentives" make you not kill Templars. That goes against what the Assassins do. WHY would a 100% sync make me NOT kill them? No reason given. This doesn't happen often, but it stands out.\n\nI was actually getting angry at the game in the end. It was such lazy mission design. None of it stood out. The story, the missions, everything was lazily thrown together to meet the deadline of christmas. Given, it works a lot better than Unity did on release... but I think Unity was, at least to some degree, a better game with a more engaging story (and that says a lot, since I didn't like Unity that much, either)\n\nThe endboss is... boring... I'll leave it there.\n\nSo... in the end, save you some money. Rather get Black Flag, Brotherhood or AC2. All of those games are miles better than Syndicate, run better on older hardware, and have much better mission design. Though some flaws noted here are present in those games as well.","January 17","false","28.5"," 42 of 70 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","42","70","2","7"

Combat is challenging yet satisfying. No longer the insane kill count you could get with III, Black Flag, or even Unity some times. Now you have to be cautious with who you pick your fights with.\n\nRope launcher is one of the funnest tools I've every used in a game. I feel like a mid century Spider-Man swinging around London, and yet, its inclusion doesn't break the gameplay, or negate the free running aspect. Speaking of which, is far more fluid than before. You still get parts where you jump to somewhere you did not want to, but no where near the clunkiness of Unity. The have ironed out the bugs, and given it a more fluid feel, and it is a huge improvement.\n\nCharacters are engaging. I have only played with Jacob so far, but the quips he makes as you play throughout the game always seem to make me chuckle. Evie is alright, but I need mroe time playing with her to really flesh out her character. Jacob being more reckless and aggressive, Evie being the voice of reason, and tactical.\n\nGang wars are enjoyable, and feel great with combat system, and recruiting rooks, and fighting blighters is easily one of my favorite parts of this.\n\nOf course, no doubt everyone is curious about the performance, especially with the debacle of Unity. The game performs flawlessly in that aspect. I have a\nGTX 980 and factory clock\nIntel i5-4690k at stock clock\n16GB of RAM\n\nAnd it runs the game so, SO smoothly. Im getting a MINIMUM of 60fps, and easily go upwards into 85-90 in the less intensive parts of roaming. No glitches yet, no horryfiying faces, and though they may be there, I have yet to see them.\n\nAll in all, this is a great addition to the franchise, and adds several new gameplay elements without being to over the top. 60$ may be a little much for the game, since it is essentially the same formula, but if you enjoy the franchise this is worth picking up.\n\n**Old Review**\nGood so far. Characters seem enaging enough, and the navigation is better. No glitches yet, and the frame rate is stellar. Pulling 60 fps constantly with a 980/4690K combo.","November 19, 2015","true","60.1"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","14","19","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aps97/recommended/368500/","aps97","[ARX]AnthonyPS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aps97/","140 products in account","I just finished both the main story and Jack The Ripper DLC so here's a review for both of them. Note that I can't say everything that I need to write in the review since the word count is very limited so don't solely rely on my review.\n\nMain Story\nIt's the first Assassin's Creed series that is set on the Industrial Revolution Era. It's always lovely to explore new important historical times in Assassin's Creed with their great attention to details. I am not a history nerd myself so I can't judge how detail are they on the depiction of 19th century London but it is already quite impressive and satisfying like most Assassin's Creed series before.\n\n1. Bugs?\nThis is a very common thing to think before purchasing a newly released game. AC: Syndicate was no longer a new game and the hype was already dying when I finished the game, but bugs can still be found. All of the bugs won't jeopardize your missions but it will prevent you from finishing certain missions if it happens on the wrong place and the wrong time (e.g your character hold on to nothing in the middle of the street and unable to move)\n2. The Story\nBeautifully written but has little explanation as usual. Almost all Assassin's Creed series post Assassin's Creed Revelation has a lot of plot holes that are left unexplained because of massive difference in era between characters. You need to find out certain things by yourself if you haven't played the series before. The story is not new-user friendly and it is confusing (e.g you won't know who's Otso Berg without playing AC: Rogue). The point is, you're controlling twin Assassins called Jacob Frye and Evie Frye, coming to London to cleanse the city from Templar's imperious control and like usual, to find a piece of Eden.\n3. New features\nThe very first noticable change is the weapons. You will no longer use swords/axes/spears/flintlock rifles anymore but you will be given kukris/cane swords/brass knuckles as a melee weapon of choice instead. The firearm is obviously replaced with many different types of revolvers since it was booming in this era. So now you'll be able to shoot 2/6/8 in a row rather than having to reload for a long time after every shot, with your enemies capable of the same thing. You'll have to dodge bullets much more often compared to the flintlock era. Melee combat system is improved with its easy combo patterns and multi kills animations which looks really cool. The second most noticable difference is the way you travel around the map.  Previous Assassin's Creed series are dominated by parkours to travel around the map quickly, but now it's changed by a rope that can be shot from your gauntlet and carriages. You can climb buildings in no time and can zipline to any climbable objects, while roads are dominated by carriages. The game also have new gang war feature, two playable main characters, friends loyalty level, perks, unlimited eagle vision, massive skill tree, character level, and many other things.\n4. Is it worth it?\nTerribly overpriced, but yes. It's better to wait for a discount, though. The gameplay is worth more hours than Unity with its territorial gang war system and you can still play some short missions from Queen Victoria even after you finished the main story. The performance does not need to be questioned. It runs well on 50-75 fps on my laptop on max settings. I did not experience any fps lock.\n\nJack the Ripper DLC\nVery short main story but a lot of side missions. Unlike the main story where the side missions are limited to Child Liberation, Templar Hunt, Gang Stronghold, and Bounty hunts, the DLC has a lot more interesting choices. But still, there are much more negative sides for this DLC. FIrst of all, the weapon is only limited to low level brass knuckles. I started the DLC after I finished my main story with level 10 equipments, and I got a level 7 equipment on the DLC, with level 11 enemies. You will do very little damage to enemies since they are focusing on the new 'Fear' feature where you can spook your enemies so that they will flee battle. The massive downside is the bug. There are bugs everywhere both in main and side missions that WILL prevent you from finishing it. For example, your character will keep crouch-walking without you being able to control it, important AIs freezes in the middle of the mission, or the most annoying one, you will tend to accidentaly kill the NPC that you're supposed to kidnap, not kill, where it will trigger the freezing AI bug and you can't interact with it anymore.\n\nThis review is far from detail but I did explain the main points it as best as I could. I already lost 4 reviews due to word limitation bug so I won't risk writing something too long anymore. Thank you for reading!","January 4","true","39.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","2"

They introduced leveling into the game. While that isn't so bad in and of itself - they made enemies that are higher level than you practically invincible badasses that'll take a hundred or more hits to kill and will also kill you in about two hits. Oh, and to make it better the levels of enemies are just randomly distributed around the city. So.. you're walking along, and totally own a group of random level 2 thugs. Walk a block over, and suddenly you're fighting the exact same thugs.. except now they're level 9 and will utterly own you without question and without the player having any chance at all. Exactly what AC games needed - an MMO leveling scheme.","November 20, 2015","false","54.2"," 124 of 228 people (54%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","54","124","228","12","11"

Some will say that this was a highlight in the storied gaming series, and it certainly felt entertaining and refreshing for its time. Since playing and completing Brotherhood, I've longed to play another Assassin's Creed game despite varied successes.\n\nI contemplated purchasing Assassin's Creed: Black Flag, but decided against it purely in opposition to its selling point: its naval exploration and combat focal points. I wanted a return to the exciting combat and incredible settings that Brotherhood (and many subsequent games) have aspired for.\n\nThat was my first mistake.\n\nI had also wanted to give Assassin's Creed: Unity a chance... but decided against it due to overwhelmingly negative peer review. Still, the idea of a co-operative Assassin's Creed game is promising.\n\nI decided that I had waited long enough. I had heard that Assassin's Creed: Syndicate attempts to capture what made Brotherhood so great. (You might even argue that Jacob Frye is emulating Ezio Auditore a little too much.)\n\nThat was my second mistake.\n\nI went ahead and purchased the gold edition for the game with having put a little time and research into the product. I came in with relatively low expectations due to repeated failures in Ubisoft's past, but was pleasantly surprised by the prologue. Jacob and Evie Frye are fascinating characters and genuinely enjoyable to play for the most part.\n\nHowever, this is not only an Ubisoft game, it's an Assassin's Creed game. What bugs and glitches I experienced at first were minor, at best, until the big one came. My hardware should have little trouble running this game on decent settings, yet despite that, I reached the infamous "Stage 3" train scene and fight.\n\nThis stage is known to cause immediate crashing, to which it has done to me aplenty. I cannot pass it, and in some cases, cannot even load to the main menu as a consequence of where my progress stopped.\n\nNow, I dislike the idea of "thumbs down"ing a game due to a performance issue I cannot resolve on my part... However, in this case, I make an exception. It is an issue many have experienced and Ubisoft has not yet addressed with patching. Until this problem is resolved, I cannot -- in good faith -- recommend this game to my friends or the general public.\n\nAlas... I had looked so forward to it.","January 27","false","4.1"," 35 of 62 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","35","62","5","2"

The freerunning mechanics have been made over complicated and unrealistic, and the optimization for the game is terrible. The cloak is locked to 30 FPS regardless of what you do and it does not support SLI. It may say it supports SLI but it doesn't. Only like 10% of your additional GPU(s) will be used, if any at all.\n\nThe game is an Assassin's Creed simulator, not anything like the previous epic stories of Ezio and Altaïr. Jacob and Evie are interesting characters but with little to offer overall. Initially you're forced to put different skills into the skill tree for each of the two characters, but eventually you'll have all the skills (potentially before reaching 40% of game completion) except for the ones locked to each character.\n\nThe NPCs in the game are a lot better, and it makes a good impression of creating a lively and vibrant world. It actually appears like every NPC is doing their own thing like normal human beings. But this doesn't compensate for the overall lack of emphasis to the story. Other characters are interesting but they die so soon and the ones that don't are the ones you don't really get to know either.","November 28, 2015","false","21.9"," 34 of 61 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","34","61","0","3"

Ok, I admit that I was never "out of love" with the series at all, but there were definitely some games in the franchise that were way better than others. I tend to see the positives, much more than the negatives, unless those negatives far overshadow the others.\n\nAnd with Syndicate, that's just not the case. Likeable player characters, likeable NPCs finally, as well as a decent story make this one of my favorites since the AC2, Brotherhood, and Revelations trio that I judge all AC games against. Yeah, I thought those were the best 3, but I still like the rest of the franchise as well. Even Unity, which I got well after all the dust had settled and was able to play pretty much trouble-free except for some minor inconsequential issues.\n\nSyndicate makes me love the series again, though, like I did back when the best ones came out. Even though Syndicate has dumbed down a lot of the combat, it's still fun and exciting to undertake, rather than dread it, and even the finishing moves are kinda cool, although a tad repetitious after awhile.\n\nIt's a fun game, feels like Assassin's Creed again, and I just love the history and ambiance that I can just immerse myself into. I love reading all the history, and like AC2, Brotherhood, and Revelations, I'm intrigued enough to start researching into the history on my own to read more about it. I've always loved reading about other time periods, and AC: Syndicate is pretty amazing.\n\nMusic is great, graphics look amazing, the character detail is phenomenal, and the architecture is really cool to climb on and sightsee from. Unless I just haven't come across them in the game, I do miss the crimescene investigation mechanic from AC: Unity that was a lot of fun. What little investigation is to be done in Syndicate is just a follow-the-dots type (dumbed-down) process that leaves a lot to be desired.","February 26","true","56.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

So to be able to play you have to remove the MFAA option. If not, some building (the first one we have to go up to) will not be displayed at all, and some terrain texture or wall texture will be transparent or sipmply buggy scanlines...\n\nHave they only tested their game before puttig it online? I doubt it it...\n\nAlso there is a huge FPS drop rate every time the camera is moving from side to side.\n\nI ma also playing in french. The voice acting is not bad, but the mobs voice acting is in english while the reste of the voices are in french there for that limit a lot the possibilites of immersion fror french people and certainly foor others too.\n\nThe keyboard is totally useless as it breaks the smoothness of the movements of our caracter (imagined for a console with analogic stick)\n\nThe gameplay is way to easy to dodge now, every time a punch or a firearm is used against you will have a notice with a big letter to hit being then able to dodge everything.\n\nRight now I am not sure the game is worth it's 60 euros but as I have not finished the scenario  yet.\n\n[EDIT 2 with gamepad] So, this second part is the final review for the introduction, after having issues with nvidia MFAA, keyboard/camera/fps issues. I have now tested with a gamepad and the game finally give all what it had to give in the first hour of gameplay.\n\nNow with a gamepad the camera is correctly sync, no more fps drop, all fine. the action is quite repetitive but it is the start of the game so...

Ubisoft is finally approaching towards the right path after the Unity mishaps. This game itself is quite enjoyable to play but it isnt perfect. There are many aspects that makes this game quite good, but there had been shortcomings which were not pleasant (maybe they'd be avoided in the next game?). I've listed a few things below which I'd like to see in the next game, if there is one.\n\nSPOILER ALERT.\n\nPros:\n-Performance is quite stable in my rig.\n-Great detailing of the architectural structures and the overall open world map.\n-Like the idea of skill development and upgrading the gang, finance and other aspects.\n-Good story line and characters.\n-Fighting with the Blighters felt quite challenging at the beginning, which is good.\n-Like the idea of new gadgets, i.e. rope launcher, voltaic bomb.\n-Introducing fight clubs and other activities were good, but it could be better esp. the carriage racing.\n-Like the idea of having backup from the Rooks, but there is always room for improvement in their intelligence.\n\n\nCons:\n-The story is too short! 9 sequences?! Why? It feels too abrupt.\n-The stories of the main characters could have been developed in a much better way, again the pace is too fast! I guess no one can beat the character build up of Ezio Auditore da Firenze.\n-More open world interactions, like getting into buildings, shops etc like in Unity. Getting into the great British structures, landmarks etc would have been good.\n-Maybe I'd like to craft the items that I actually want to use, and not craft every single thing on the menu?! Why should that matter for full synchronization of the game?!\n-Expected the associates to be more helpful and have significant roles in the storyline than to provide schematics, rewards from petty theft etc.\n-No present world interaction. Some previous games like Brotherhood, Black Flag had some but still it wasnt enough. It would be good to incorporate Shawn, Rebecca, Galina etc as playable characters. Plus, I'd like to know more about the identity of the initiate. Why is he even helping the Assassins?\n-Side missions felt too easy and predictable.\n\nI'm not saying that the game isnt good, I'm only suggesting the things that could have made my experience of playing this game even better.","December 27, 2015","true","102.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

The ability to switch between two main characters is a nice addition. You can play either Jacob or Evie for most of the time. The story missions will force you to be one of them, but it's ultimately your choice for everything else. There are a lot of side activities, side missions, chests, collectables, and community events.\n\nJacob and Evie share weapons and have similar skills, but they spend skill points independently and each character gains a skill point whenever you gain one point, meaning you can have two completely different strengths. However, most of the skills will be acquired by each character near the end of the game.\n\nThere are outfits with unique bonuses for each character, gang skills that provide benefits for you and your gang, and crafting upgrades to increase the effectiveness of secondary items.\n\nAmbient noise occupies your speakers for a large part of the time as you traverse the rooftops, but missions and activities keep the music flowing.\n\nThe distances between buildings and their sheer size have introduced a new method of travel, the grappling hook.\n\nI only have one negative note for this game, more music during lengthy explorations.","May 4","true","49.1"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

Picked it up on sale and was thoroughly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.\n\nIt reminded me hugely of the Ezio trilogy, arguably the best Assassin's Creed games. The world feels perfect to travel across, the player characters are likable with each of them having their own goal for the creed.\n\nThe level up system is far better than the terrible idea in Unity where you must play through the missions and reach certain sequences before you could even get basic Assassin abilities. You can level up in any way in this game, unlock loads of brilliant abilities. Likewise with upgrading your gang ("The Rooks") and your gear.\n\n98% in the main game (enough for me, not bothered about 100%) and 100% in the Jack the Ripper DLC which was absolutely bloody fantastic, albeit very dark (no complaints, worked incredibly well).\n\nLike the older AC games, especially the Ezio trilogy?

Through out the game you are working on taking out the templars that control the streets of London. Your main goal is to take out Crawford Starrick and take control of London for yourselves.\n\nThat's pretty much how I saw the game at least.\n\nAssassins Creed Syndicate brings back parts of previous Assassins Creed games that haven't been seen for a while. The game is very entertaining for the most part, but can get to the point where it starts to drag on in the end. You gain experience through out playing the game that allow you to increase your combat skill, add additional perks to each character and unlock new items to use upon reaching new levels and completing sequences. You also have to look for items throughout London to upgrade you gang by giving them better weapons, horse carriages to drive around the city, and just making the stronger in general. The game includes a lot of the fighting style and combat mechanics as Unity and a few from Rogue.\n\nAesthetics, the game looks... well... decent. I'm not able to run it on the highest of settings but I can run it decently and it looks okay. I think they could have done a way better job on how this game looks even though it's during the "steampunk" era. Like Black Flag that game was absolutely gorgeous, this game is honestly kind of a let down to me personally when it comes to graphics but it still looks amazing and is fun to play.\n\nAll in all or TL;DR:\nThis game is fun and has a lot of exciting moments in and brings a whole new feel to the Assassins Creed Franchise in my opinion kind of like how Black Flag and Brotherhood change the series as a whole. I would recommend this game to anyone who is just looking for a really fun game to play that might take them around 40 - 50 hours to complete in total. I rate this game a solid 8.5/10 overall gaming aspects but for an Assassins Creed game it gets 9/10 from me. Nothing will ever be better than Black FLag and Brotherhood to me.

All of the complaints about the dullness of the combat system have come home to roost in the rotting ravenry that is this series.","March 26","false","9.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Which I'm 100% fine with. I have all settings maxxed but I set Shadows to High and Antialiasing to FXAA. I found that by setting the Shadows to High that made the frame rate WAY better. Now the gameplay is great, the new fighting system is fun and fast to learn. The new Free Run Up and Free Run Down is nice but some people think Ubisoft is pandering to the noobs. I believe it makes it easier and somewhat funner. But if you go back to playing another Assassin's Creed game you'll find yourself trying to play Syndicate style cause the systems are so different. Eagle Eye can now be used while walking for as long as you want versus being stationary and moving. Also the dynamic of Jacob and Evie are really cool. They're easily the best characters so far in a Creed game. They make me hope and wish that Ubi uses these characters again. You can switch on the fly between Jacob and Evie by pressing the Start Button and then clicking the R3 analog stick. All in all it appears Ubi has in fact learned alot from the Unity incident.","November 19, 2015","true","5.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Well, if you have played the previous ones and hate the controls, movement, story, yearly releases and whatnot, buy this. Once again Ubisoft proves to the world that AC is just another disaster under the publishers wings.\n\nQuick summa summarum:\n\n\nGame is set on victorian era London and you have to play as a dimwitted duo of Assassin Legacies (trust me, not assassins anymore. Gentle blend of brawling and the league of extraordinary gentlemen). The setting itself is fun and interesting, but it is not alive. The pedestrians walk aimlessly up and down the roads and after couple of hours you just start spotting the red guys who need to go. Walk close, press X, deal is done.\n\nCons\n- The game is graphically satisfying, but falls short on delivering it.\n- Remember the sticky slime-things you could buy from bubblegum machines in your youth? Meet our designer of controls.\n- Story is not immersive, it falls short and it has nothing to do with anything, the last time Ubisoft delivered something new and fresh was 2004. The story is like watching the Kardashians after DMT.\n- You can actually purchase in-game boosters for single player game.\n- Did I mention the controls?\n- The in-game crafting system and upgrading yourself as you go is like playing Farmville on Facebook. You shouldn't bother, and after a few accidents you realize there really is nothing more to be done, except waiting.\n- Overall quality of the product is not that good.\n- No multiplayer support but still they introduced micro-transactions to the game. (Not that it would be good to have one)\n- Repetitive gameplay and mission mechanics, feels like doing the same thing for 15h.\n\n\n\nPros\n\n+-0\n\n+ Graphics are fairly good\n+ Animations are fairly good, although sloppy and laggy\n\n\n\n4.5/10, wouldn't recommend if it's not on -70% sale.","February 17","false","11.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I've used Steam's streaming to broadcast my playing to some friends. Every friend I've shown the game to so far has taken an immediate liking to it.\n\nI highly, highly recommend this game.\n\nI took a gamble considering the previous Ubisoft releases over the past couple years and their ever-declining quality. Watch_Dogs was supposed to be my jam, and the game was so terrible to play on PC, it killed me inside. AC Unity and FC4 both disappointed me highly.\n\nAssassin's Creed Syndicate is definitely living up to my hopes of what an Assassin's Creed game should be. The movements are much more fluid. The cover system is much more intuitive. Stealth is highly highly enjoyable.\n\nThere's "I wanted to move here" bugs occassionally, but on the whole, movement has been intuitive the entire time.\n\nThe story is highly enjoyable compared to AC Unity, and I would rank it up there with AC Brotherhood or Revelations in terms of quality of story. Amazingly enjoyable, but not necessarily the best story hands-down.\n\nThe gameplay in this game is easily my favorite of all the Assassin's Creed series.\n\n10/10 Would recommend being Victorian age Spiderman again","November 24, 2015","true","39.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

After about an hour more of testing the game seems to be running smoothly.  Upon my first few minutes with the game everything seemed fine until I exited the factory in the beginning to the alley.  After I entered the alley way I was greeted to a slide show of 3 frames per second.  Prior I was doing no lower than 38fps inside the factory (I was playing at 4K Ultra with no AA or Occ.)  The game was also freezing as I entered and exited the pause menu.\n\nSpecs:\n\nIntel i7 4790k @ 4.36ghz\nMSI 4G Gaming Edition GTX 970 in 2 way SLI\nRipjaws Trident X 16gb @ 2400mhz\n(Played on a Samsung 1tb 850 Evo)\n\nTests:\n\n1st Test: Disable SLI and drop down to 1080p Low, No AA, No Occ.-  Solid 60\n2nd Test: Re enable SLI and stay with the same settings- Solid 60\n3rd Test: Up the settings to 4K Low- 40 - 50 fps (No AA, No Occ)\n4th Test: Up the settings to 4K Ultra (No AA, No Occ)- 38-50fps\n5th Test: (This was after I slept and jumped back on) 2K Ultra, High Shadows, MSAA 2x + FXAA, No Occ. 50-60fps\n\nIt appears that this game's first few launches are bad but it works itself out.\n\nUbisoft still has some work that must be done but all in all this is WAY better than Unity, both in story, characters and performance.  Syndicate seems almost reminiscent of the Ezio games.

It seems as if there is always something to do as you walk across the London streets.

The other characters that you meet along the way are also very nice. I enjoyed the connection Henry Green and Evie had with eachother, they would be a great couple :). There is only one thing I didn't quite like with the story. I wished we would have met Starrick at least a few times before the battle.

Ubisoft learned from Unity's failings, and has crafted an AC game that is as much fun as any AC has been since Brotherhood or Black Flag. I have played every main AC game, and completed them all, except for AC3 (which was a debacle) and Liberation, which I just lost interest in.\n\n1868 London (and a quick jaunt to 1916!) is a wonderful place to explore. Sure, it's really a Dickensian nightmare, but it feels so real! I really did feel like I was walking through a living city, something I haven't felt since Revelations' Constantinople. The city is the sort of place you want to just wander around and look at! Trafalgar Square, the Tower, Piccadilly Circus, Parliament; all of these are places to go and marvel at!\n\nThe gameplay is likewise fantastic. The fighting is as fluid as it's ever been, and despite having all the same AC fighting issues as the rest of the series, it's still a blast to fight your way through a group of Templars. My only complaint is that choosing your fist as a weapon has been removed from the engine. That means those poor Bobbies are getting gutted just for doing their job. It's not as bad as the bar "fight" from Unity, but a lack of a fist option seems silly, when really, sometimes you just want to knock the guy down.\n\nThe only real gameplay issue I have is the carriage driving. Apparently, horses in Victorian London were pretty damned tough! I can race down the sidewalk in a carriage, knocking over iron-lamp posts with impunity, and the horses are cool with that. There are only a few missions requiring the use of a carriage, and I despised them all. Thankfully, they're quickly done, and mostly easy.\n\nI am 50 hours into this game. I've completed the main storyline, the Queen Victoria missions you get after that, and am now in the midst of the 1916 missions. The 1916 mission, set in and around Tower bridge, are probably several hours worth of play, on their own, and a fascinating look into the death of the Victorian/Edwardian world.\n\nAnd you know what? There's more to come. The Last Maharajah missions are coming, and the Jack the Ripper DLC.\n\nI spent $120cdn on this game. I can honestly say, I have not spent money this well on a game in many, many years!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaeCry/recommended/368500/","JaeCry","JaeCry >>CSGORamboPot.com<<","http://steamcommunity.com/id/JaeCry/","76 products in account","Assassin's Creed Syndicate\nSyndicate is another Assassin's Creed game set in 19th century London. I say another because not much has changed from the previous titles. You get a third-person action-adventure RPG with the same basic fighting skills and controls as any other Assassin's Creed game. What does Syndicate give you? A step back on a new engine.\n\nWhat's Improved\nSyndicate is designed on the same engine as Unity and looks very much the same as Unity did last year only without the poorly opimized gameplay Unity had upon release (fixed four months later). You get a new gadget to play with early on in the game, the grappling attachment to the assassin's blade. Syndicate also takes a step back to older styled combat after fans complained that Unity was overly simplified which provides a steeper challenge, especially if you wander into an area a few levels higher.\n\nWhat's Unimproved\nI found navagating the city worse than Unity. Unity for the most part was very decent except trying to jump off a fence or going into a window. Syndicate's controls with a keyboard and mouse are worse. I can be climbing and trying to shimmy right with the "D" key pressed and Jacob shimmys left! In just over 12 hours of gameplay, I have had this happen several times while trying to navigate support beams under bridges and the train stations.\n\nAnother area I found disappointing was the lack of stats on gear choices that Unity introduced. I rather enjoyed having so many options to load my character up with to attempt a stealth vs full on kill everything mission. Syndicate takes another step back to the quest rewards and crafting gear with very limited options other than those found on outfits.\n\nCo-Op\nOne aspect of Unity I really enjoyed was the Co-Op club activities I played with my 12 year old son. We had a blast and as a result I have over two hundred hours in Unity which is double what I have in any other AC game and up to 5 times what I have in the older AC titles. I was very disappointed that the Co-Op club activities were abandoned in Syndicate this time around as I found that to be one of the most redeeming qualities of Unity.\n\nThe Story\nThe story is good, not great. It is the familar obtain the pieces of eden at any cost from or before the templars use them to destory the world with corrupt power. The best part of the sotry is that you get to play as two people. The interaction between the twins (Jacob & Evie) really help to push the story along and make it fun. For the most part you can choose who you want to play with the exception of the story line which will force you to play one or the other at times.\n\nGraphics\nGraphically Syndicate looks as great as Unity did, maybe just a bit better. The engine runs smooth although the system requirements are extremely steep. Running triple SLI with 3x gtx 980s my frame rate will take a hit with everything on max settings but that may be in part due to a lack of sli support. On a good note, the game still looks great on lower/mid cards such as a gtx 960 on low settings. Syndicate definitely looks better than Unity did on low settings.\n\nPros\nBetter combat\nBetter optimized graphics\nFun interaction between twin characters\n\nCons\nControls are worse\nNo Co-Op club activities\nLimited stats to build your character\n\nRecommendation\nI was very disappointed in the absence of the Co-Op club activities, the poor control issues, and the lack of stats on gear for character custimization. But in the end Syndicate does provide that very familar AC game experience if not over familar. Syndicate is ejoyable although do not expect to spend several hundred hours in this title like you may have with AC IV Black Flag, AC Rogue, or AC Unity. The content of ship battles, exploration, and Co-Op activities are just not there.","January 1","true","5.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dooMarine/recommended/368500/","dooMarine","Player","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dooMarine/","78 products in account","PROS:\n✔Syndicate has no perfomance issues and contains no gamebreaking bugs. A big step forward after disaster of 2014 called Assassin's Creed Unity\n✔Designers did their best in recreating London of Victorian Era. City is looking quite alive and historically accurate. And this magnificent views from sync points\n✔Concept of two characters is a fresh idea for the franchise. Moreover Evie and Jacob are one of the most interesting characters in the series since Ezio and Haytham. Now take a look at the dull and cliched character of Arno\n✔New fight mechanic removes big swords and axes and adding a fast and light weaponry. Combat itself is looking more impressive and playing much faster now\n✔Comfortable shooting mechanic. In Unity I can barely hit someting with pistols with such clunky controls. And here shooting mechanics is nice and easy\n✔Grapling hook is a blast! Since the buildings are much bigger now, devs added a mean to reach the top of it much faster\n✔Assassinate missions are designed in Hitman style. You need to plan your assassination and there are multiple ways to complete your task. I am so glad devs actually returning to the concept of the AC1\n✔A lot of working RPG elements. Syndicate has working and balanced levelling system. Compare it to the grind disaster in Unity\n✔Music. Austin Wintory did a great job on Syndicate soundtrack. It fits the game perfectly\n\nCONS:\n✘Plot is WEAK. Yes, there is a lot of well-written characters here. Look at Frye twins for example. But the story itself feels dull and stupid. Character motivations is unclear and there are a lot of weak spots in this plot. And modern storyline is pathetic\n✘Missions are WEAK. Dont get me wrong. They are well done in design terms. But they so dull and unrealistic. Sometimes they just break the whole immersion in the game world\n✘Graphics looks downgraded after Unity. But I guess this is a part of optimization\n\nSummary:\nIf you still feel dissapointed in Assassin's Creed franchise after Unity release, try Syndicate. Of course it is still a pretty standart AC game, nothing unusual. But it is pretty solid though.","February 13","true","33.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Syndicate combines the good looking graphics and enormous city of Unity and the attention to detail and interesting game mechanics of Black Flag.\n\nWe see the return of the Whistle, we can also carry bodies and hide them or put them in a particular spot to attract attention. Combat has been refreshed and while at the first few levels its a little bit boring, it gets much more interesting later on as you aquire new skills and combos.\n\nThe game offers a variety of activities stretching from Fight Clubs, Carriage races to Templar Hunts and Gang Wars.\n\nThe story 6 hours into the game appears to be much more immersive and connected to the Real Life stuff - something that was missing in Unity.\n\nThere are no game breaking bugs in the game but it is far from perfect optimisation.

So I definitely recommend it. Although if running on lower reolution than monitor's native textures tend to flicker but I quickly changed when it gave me the option to. Another quick thing is that for some reason on my R9 270 it says I have to update my drivers yet when I go to update drivers it says it's at the latest version I think this game was made first for NVIDIA Graphics cards. EDIT: Ignore the last thing I said there actually was an update just not on the app but I had to go on the website and I updated and I think it runs about 3-10 fps better.","November 19, 2015","true","32.0"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","13","24","0","0"

This game is the new coming of mighty Assasins Creed series and its well made and fun so far. Thing worth to mention is that game is very very demanding especially if you want to play it on solid 60fps. I have GTX 980Ti GPU and Intel Xeon e3 1231V3 CPU and i can manage very solid +60fps with good quality eye candy but people with lower powered gear should consider twice if solid 60fps is their goal with decent looking game. I really recommend this game since it has great and interesting story with good game mechanics and glorious graphics plus that semi-well done optimization. Its on sale now and if you were Assasins Creed fan like me before the Unity, you are definately going to enjoy this one like good ol AC games in the past.\n\n9/10 would buy this again even at full price.

The Victorian London setting brings a certain degree of comedy and sarcasm to each of the characters featured in the story. In turn this makes for an entertaining experience and leaves you begging for more.\n\nThe two new Assassins fit the game perfectly and are certainly inline with the likes of Ezio and the Kenways. The brother and sister relationship between the two make for great banter and bring variaty to the gameplay. Although at times it can feel like Jacob is the prefered Assassin in the story. Both are badass and deserve another game.\n\nThe game runs smoothly at a constant 60fps (that is with most 'Nvidea Gameworks' features disabled) and certainly outshines the performance of Unity. There are minor bugs here are there, but nothing to distract from the game world. To put it best, it's The Animus. It's not perfect by any means, however that's simply AC for you.\n\nUbisoft are taking a step in the right direction but it is another AC game. If that's what you're after, you'll love it as I have done. If you're looking for something different you may be a tad dissapointed (although London does offer it's own unique experience). I really hope that this amazing game isn't outshadowed by the shaky release of the previous game, Unity.\n\nPros:\n- Victorian London (Vast open city with great detail)\n- Interesting Combat (Fist to Fist, Kuncle Dusters, Canes)\n- Playable Assassins (Jacob and Evie Frye)\n- Interesting use of London (Queen Victoria, Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Sherlock Holmes Outfit, Jack the Ripper)\n- Collectables (Secrets of London are fun to find via Database Images)\n- Villans are truly British.. I mean... Evil\n\nCons:\n- Minor Bugs\n- Clothing Physics (30 fps)\n- Too Easy (For an experienced AC player)\n- No Multiplayer\n\n\nUPDATE: The Jack The Ripper DLC is really something amazing. However there does seem to be a large number of performance issues around it, which is a massive shame.","December 12, 2015","true","58.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Wonderful experience. Had enough of nice cutscenes to tell a decent story. Nice to be able to swtich character most of the time. I loved Elise from ACU, and Evie Frye didn't disappoint either. Did I mention pretty as well? AC series has such strong female characters. Nice to have a happy ending (in contrast to ACU). The ending brought a tear to my eyes. Alas, all good things will come to an end ... a memorable end, though. Will remember Elise & Evie for a long time. :) Technically, this PC version is sound. Had a few occasions where the game either hangs or have some glitch. None too bothersome though. Restarted and everything's fine again. This game is much more optimized and bug-free then ACU. Nice to have automatic saving too (while RPGs often require you to do tedious manual saving every now & then). Well, the animation of the fighting action impressed me too. The character models are nice. The crowds are there on the streets, making London a lively city. Was not able to buy Helix & XP points with real money though. Just got an error message.

The game sidelined the main quest in favor of a ridiculous amount of Ubi outpost/tower challenges, which made it quite similar to Assassin's Creed Brotherhood. I was surprised how demanding some of these challenges were, especially if you aimed for the optional mission objectives. The traversal was improved compared with last year's Unity, and the charismatic pair of main characters were also a clear improvement compared with the pale main character in that game.","January 23","true","9.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It runs a whole lot better than Unity. I've played 30 mins so far, ran around to check out the graphics and controls (in crowd, too).\n\nI'm using GTX 780Ti (3GB VRAM), 8GB DDR3 (2133 Mhz), i7-2600k 3.4 Ghz (OC to 4.2 Ghz) and all settings are maxed out, except for PCSS-Ultra shadows (I'd need 400 MB more VRAM for that)\n\nGraphics settings give you a slider, it explains what settings do what exactly. However the game autodetects settings on start, NVIDIA experience suggested max settings, and works.\n\nIt does burn the GPU but there must be a lot less draw calls passed on to the CPU per frame, it stays relatively cold (as opposed to Unity when the PC wants to take off) Visually, it looks nice, the combat seems improved, but can't say much about that yet, as I'm about to actually start discovering London.\n\nIf you had doubts like I did - compare your specs with mine and decide. Seems like weaker systems can handle it on lower settings easily. I might write another review about controls and gameplay as I play the game.\n\n","November 19, 2015","true","33.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I like the story line so far, and i can say for sure that this is one of those storylines where you care about the main characters. So far i am not too happy about the combat system, but that is more like a personal opinion. Personally i prefer the old combat system, where everything was a little bit ''easier''. Syndicate takes Assasins creed to the next level, because the choices you make in combat does matter, and you can indeed end up dead if you choose wrong.\n\nThe Graphics are ok. Just like any other assasins creed game, i dont really see a big difference in graphics, but hey, that might just be me being stupid. My game did also end up crashing 1 minute into the game, but it did not happen again. Maybe this just had something to do with the launch. I am also getting a lot of loading lag spikes whilst driving a carriage, but i dont really prefer the carriage so it does not matter to me.\n\nI will for sure finish the campaign and try to master the combat system so i can have some fun, but i dont see myself playing a lot of hours after the main story.\n\nSo as an assasins creed fan, is it worth buying?\nYes it is. You can for sure get a lot of hours of fun gameplay and interesting Main quests.\n\nSo is it worth getting today? Should i pay the full price?\nI would say no. The game has some stuff that i simply not prefer and do not like compared to other assasins creed games. I suggest looking up some gameplay and story on youtube before buying the game for its full price.","November 21, 2015","true","22.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

The melee combat is much faster paced and the takedowns are incredibly over the top, I bashed a guy in the head with a cane and he did a full flip and then I hit him again to kill him, they're cool looking none the less but it's a little too over the top at times.\n\nJacob and Evie are probably my all time favorite protagonist's out of all AC games, I played Rogue and I felt that Shay was an amazing character to play as but running around as Jacob or Evie is much more enjoyable this time around.\n\nThe customization is nicely done, they still offer micro transactions like they did in Unity but it feels much less forced now, I've been able to quickly get the equipment I want by just playing the game the way I want to, I don't feel forced to buy a package of in game money so I can upgrade my weapon. So that's good!\n\nOne thing that bothers me is the lack of inventory and equipment, you're only able to equip your weapon in full combat as well as the hidden blade which really bothers me, the whole point of the cane sword is to have a weapon concealed in an average cane but you don't even get to see it! You fight someone and then you take the cane out of your coat pocket and then put it back in after the fight is over, I would like to be able to walk around with the cane hanging out in my hands like in the screenshots but nope. Maybe they'll fix it in an update.\n\nAll in all Syndicate is great, it runs well, it's gameplay is great, London is incredibly fun to be in, the characters are well rounded and have a good sense of humour, and the addition of being able to walk around the city with a gang following you is very cool, feels much like Peaky Blinders the game (Great show if you haven't watched it already!)\n","November 22, 2015","true","25.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

At first the combat felt a bit "spammy" since you do have to mash attack a lot, but you also have to mix in stuns and dodges.\n\nThe parkour has been changed a bit too, you can now "freerun down" meaning that instead of leaping out towards whatever ledge may or may not be reachable, you jump or climb down the side of whatever you're on. This is something I didn't even really realize the game needed, but it is an awesome change.\n\nThe story uses two characters, the Frye Twins that you can freely switch between when in the open world but for missions it will force you to play as one of them, some of the main missions force you to play as both of them as they simoltaneously do different parts of the same mission. I think the whole character swapping thing is a cool idea but it feels forced, like they included that feature just for the sake of having it rather than it being core to the gameplay.\n\nOverall this is a solid game that runs really well (i5 4440, GTX 980, 8GB RAM) on all but maxed settings, as usual, the Nvidia game(doesn't)works stuff murders your framerate (having all the nvidia stuff turned on will eat a solid ~15 fps if not more) but with those turned off it runs great and still looks good.\n\nSeems like between Unity and the even bigger ♥♥♥♥♥how that was Arkham Knight Ubisoft finally realized how to make a good PC port.","November 26, 2015","true","6.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The setting is nice and atmospheric, the free-running flows nicely in most cases and the killing is fun. Even though conquering london was pretty generic I still enjoyed those missions and did all of them. The story is alright, nothing to write home about.\n\nNow, the negative: What the hell is wrong with the ports for PC of this franchise? All the AC creed games I have played have had severe technical issues on PC. This title is no different and with no patches in sight, I am dismayed and hope I will never purchase another game from this franchise again even though I'm a sucker for it. The game crashes and often freezes on my GTX980 and i5 for 10s of seconds at a time, the screen tearing is horrid even with v-sync on and no amount of third-party tinkering fixed it for me.\n\nAfter all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I had to endure to finish this game I can't possibly recommend anyone else to go through the same.","January 4","false","35.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I got into AC recently starting with Black Flag and then the Ezio Trilogy and the movement is flows really well. Some vets may not like it but you use more buttons now for the free running as opposed to Black Flag/Rogue where you use only 1 button to free run. This uses 2 for the free running whether you want to go up or down so you should have more control on your movement. The story is not the greatest since it's relatively safe so it's not the greatest story in the world but it makes up for it with some of my favorite main chartacters in an AC since Edward Kenway and Ezio Auditore. Jacob and Evie Frye are an awesome brother and sister duo with Jacob being the less serious brother who prefers loud and proud and building up a gang and Evie being more serious with the Assassin and Templar business and prefers being stealthy and healthy. Jacob and Evie are incredibly likable and the 2 together in cutscenes I always have a chuckle with Jacob's sarcasm and not giving a crap about Templar stuff and Evie trying to be serious and get him to get it together. This is a very light hearted AC not as serious as previous titles so I like the change in direction the story takes. Not to mention. London looks beautiful in this game,  The PC Version runs really good on my PC as well, so it's very well optimized. I would definitely reccommend Assassin's Creed Syndicate if Unity gave you a bad taste or if you haven't played an AC game in a long time.","March 18","true","107.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

What I loved about the game is that you had historical characters such as Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Alexander Graham Bell and more. The storyline ain't at all times hipped but there are those moments where you go waaah. Levelling up to gain skill points and gaining new weapons and accessories makes you enthralled. Even when you complete the storyline you still get extra side missions. Ubisoft have made the time and effort to create an amazing Assassin's Creed game. If you haven't purchased this game, than damn you!!\nAn absolute elegant, sumptuous Assassin's Creed game that rewards serious stealth and brisk reactions.\nThe best AC yet IMHO!","December 20, 2015","true","50.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

Player can play as he/she wants, allows much freedom in playstyle and how to approach missions. Fantastic openworld environment and stunning scenery.\n\nGame runs very smooth on my GTX980ti. Runs with all graphic settings maxed out including all Nvidia Gameworks features with more the 60FPS. Uses more then 4GB VRAM when maxed out so you'll need a card with enough VRAM to cope with that. So people with a GTX980 (or lower specs) have to lower some graphic settings.\n\nMissions and game play are more diverse then the previous AC Unity game. Also being able to play female and male is a nice bonus. Yes you play both :-)\n\nI did not have any bugs so far, probably there will be some like every game has, but overall nothing to worry about. Make sure latest Graphic card drivers are correctly installed. Better do a clean driver install and let the ingame settings overrule the driver settings.\n\nHoping this was useful for someone.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evil745/recommended/368500/","evil745","President Evil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evil745/","394 products in account","ehh..  So here is My review...  I completed game with 93% synchronization.\n\nGood Things:\n+few new things like wrope attachment to hidden blade. easier way to get to roof.\n+carriages. Grand Thief Carriages.  You can hijack carrages drive trought London like crazy. You can throw darts to other carriage horses, so they become wildy. [kinda fun]\n+Graphics are real good better than unity.\n+Many Different types of Enemy and Ally units.\n+Eagle Vision is better [too good]\n+I like Trains. yes i actually like assassins base on train. That is good idea.\n+ Volt Granades is good thingy\n+Story lane it self is pretty good. ww1 mission is the best of all\n+End Fight is AWESOME!\n\nNow bad Things:\n- 1st I hate the most. Free Run SAFETY! WHY! UBISOFT WHY! Why need something like that?! I you need to follow someone or quickly escame, or you want quickly cross thames. All the time Jacob/Evie stops at stops at the edge. Then Shows sign on screen  [shift+w+e] i pressed once, twice! nothing at third time they dicide to jump water or if you on roof they jump whatever they like.\n\n-Climbing to walls is not challenge anymore. If we go back to Eczio games AC2 part2 where Rosa Teach Eczio how to jump up to walls wihile climbing. [Here the link-https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UILXQ3OnwSM] Then in Syndicate you can jump up to wall most inpossible heights. That make game too easy, and not realistic. And when you get wrope attachmet, just jump from one building to anothet like spiderman.\n\n-Targeting. I like wrope gun, but to shoot wrope need to point spot where you want shoot wrope. So i sit on building in front of me is Helix fragment. I want to get it.  I have to shoot wrope to other building to collect it. Sounds Easy.But when you try to point wrope to place you need. 60% times he/she shoot it else where. ok here another example. when you chasing Carriage and you all you need is quickly pull urself to front building roof. I pull camera up a little, and pressed R to shoot wrope, but she/he shoot wrope to other building who is behind somewhere, plus you cant to detach so quickly. So badguys escaped and mission failed.\n\n-combating is boring and annoying. If you remember old Conor days AC3 or Black Flag, how you can steal enemy weapons or pick them up from dead body. NOW YOU CAN'T YaaaaaaaY! In combat you can't: throw sand or dirt in oponent face, you can't taunt, you can't, steal their weapons, you can't hang them, you can't do multikils more than 3 guys, can't use guys as meat shield, you can't block [ at least i don't know how]. Now What you can: you can punch them face, you can stab them, you can quickly finish them using F key, you can dodge from bullets using F key,and  you can breeak blocks [logically]. some fights 1v1 may take more than 5-8min with random bad guy on street.\n\n- You can't jump on place. if Helix fragment is right above ur head and you need only jump a little tiny bit, to collect it. but you can't...\n\n-Crowd event thieves: same as Unity thieves are bad at escaping. In unity they was averige age man who steals wallet and slowly clumsy try to run away. In syndicate they are changed. In place of average man they are old womans, who steals purse, and same way clumsy try to escape. But  then mighty Assasin Jacobs do the body slam on that old woman to the ground and take back stolen stuff.\n\n-and there still is some bugs. like looting same chest 2x. After saving women on street from criminals she suddenly turns in big strong baldhead, who still talks in womens voice. Or killed person but he stand up and start to walk away foward. Once was raining man from clear sky, they fall and died. and other little bugs...\n\n-Maybe I'm wrong, but there is a waaaaaaay mutch english humor. Each cut scene Jacob and Evie insulting each other with cheep jokes. This made me skip many cutscenes.\n\n-still pay to quick boost your hero, still pay to get in game cash. You can pay real money to get healix cash and get better stuff in fast way...\n\n-and i don't get it Why need somekind skill trees... WHY! old Assassin creeds was so good without somekind skill trees. The best was old fashon way. Get stuff and new skills when you get further in campaign missions.\n\nFinal Summation:\n\n*If you are fan of all Assassin games have played all of them. Then you will be happy to know Syndicate is better than unity, but still one of worst assassin games.\n\n*But If you are new to assassin games then go and try this game it is not bad for those who don't realy know all story lane.\n\nMy own game rating is 6/10stars it is playable but not good enought. Definitely not worth 59.99$ That is a BIG NO.  19$- 21$ maybe but Not 59,99$.","April 5","true","53.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"

Both games are dull, boring and uninspired.  I keep trying to like them.  I keep trying to finish them.  And in the end, I just can't because the substance that makes a game fun just isn't there.\n\nThen again, I loved all the games through Black Flag, including ACIII, so maybe I just have different tastes.  I'm also not a city person, so being stuck in the same city, where every rooftop looks pretty much like every other rooftop, is just plain boring to me.  In ACI through Black Flag, I always felt like I was discovering new places and meeting new people until the end of the game.  A few hours into this game, and it feels like I've seen all there is to see, even when I go to new areas.  The missions are repetitive, the side quests lackluster, and the characters wooden.  Altair had his arrogance, Ezio had his charm, Connor had his anger, and Edward had his ambiguous morals, and all these characters had their traits and their transformations linked to their stories.  Evie (is that even her name?  I can't even remember) and Jacob (which I only remember because it's written in the game description) are so generic they're interchangeable and forgettable.  There's no backstory, no compelling reason for them to fight the fight they're fighting, and it makes for a dull tale.  I'm actually more than a few hours into the game, and I'm probably just going to give up on it because I don't care.  I'm not interested.  It's almost a chore - I should finish this game just in case there's something interesting that springs up - rather than a compulsion.\n\nSo in short, is this a bad game?  No.  Is it an interesting game?  Also, unfortunately, no.  And that's why I just can't recommend it.","June 3","false","52.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chairmanxyz/recommended/368500/","chairmanxyz","Chairman_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chairmanxyz/","126 products in account","I basically wrote a long post about this in the discussion forums but I'll sum it up here. Syndicate is a brilliant Assassin's Creed experience, though it leaves something to be desired. First of all, they really did a fantastic job dropping everything that was tedious and broken in Unity. The activities are fun and not time consuming or draining. Collectables are actually useful and most things you find just while playing so there'd no need to go running off too often specifically looking to get collectables that do absolutely nothing to improve your character.\n\nSpeaking of characters, they are very well written, at least the dynamic assassin duo that are the Frye twins. If you're worried about another Arno, you know the guy who followed the creed the the T and refused to be practical and sensible when feeling and emotions got involved, worry not because the Frye's are the exact opposite. They have some great, interesting dialogue written for them and they do not grow stale or predictable. I especially loved the way Evie became more and more of abadass as you used her more. I was actually torn between who to take out in the open world at times because they're both equally powerful characters in their own ways.\n\nThe world is stunning! London is captured in the usual Ubisoft splendour, that is to say no detail is left out and everything is meticulously rendered as it would have looked in this 1800s industrial powerhouse. Carriage combat is fun and an extremely quick, and often more reliable method of transport. Coupled with the addition of the grapling hook, you'll find yourself preferring to zoom across the city in minutes rather than fast traveling in favour of taking in the sights.\n\nNow, the only negative thing I have to add to this already lengthy, rambly review is that the villians really pulled the short stick this time around. It's been some time since Ubisoft has produced a game with did all four of the big ones well, that is combat, 'protagonists', 'antagonists', and worldspace. This game is no exception because as you might of noticed, the only thing I haven't praised yet are the antagonists, the good old Templar Order we know and love. In this game you're introduced to the great Templar Order's English Rite, said to be the most powerful, influential, and oldest sect of their ancient empire. Naturally, you expect their leader Crawford Starrick, to appropriately radiate the amout of power, cunning, and intellect required of someone in charge of such a gem. Unfortunately, this is not the case. Starrick is an interesting villian in his own right, however he is very much a cliche comic book, bond villian. I won't get into too much detail but let's just say chasing after this man isn't as thrilling and exciting as I'd have liked from an AC game, and after finishing the main story ark, I find myself wanting more from this villian who had so much more potential.\n\nAll in all, I put in a nice chunk of time into this game and I thoroughly enjoyed it. With a pretty interesting cliff-hanger I'm more than excited about next year's entry where the modern day is sure to be back in full force!","December 6, 2015","true","64.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

I like the time period and the new "gang" system which is a spin on your pirate friends from black flag. I also think the grapling hook taking away most of the wall climbing is awesome too because it keeps the game at a quicker pace and the combat has been improved slightly.\n\nOn the other hand most of the "side missions" are all the same 4-5 missions just slightly harder to give weight to their arbitrary level system. The twin switching is pointless due to the fact that with in the first few hours you will find out that one fits your style of playing more and you will never willingly play the other. also the story goes at such a breakneck pace your head will spin right off.","January 12","false","13.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

No FPS drops, fluid 60 FPS. I have not played Unity nor Rogue yet, but this is the game AC fans have been waiting for on PC. Stunning visuals (and then again, I'm on medium), London is H U G E and quite accurate with the layout.\n\nHookshoot is a really cool, new mechanic. You can zipline through London real quick and enjoy the views. Train hideout is genious, serves better as a Fast Travel point most of the time. Combat it good, combat rings are great, liberation mission (though Bounty Hunter missions are the least enjoyable for me) are well thought, not very easy, but not frustratingly hard to get all constraints.\n\nStill on sequence 4 so not much I can tell you about the story, plus I lack Unity (and perhaps Rogue) background on the Present-Day storyline to completely grasp it. Charle sDickens and Darwin's missions and story are fun and entertaining. Can't wait for Jack the Ripper DLC and idk when you play The Last Maharajah. Outfits are cool, plus have perks depending on which previous assassin (or assassinette [?]) you choose.\n\nPlus Evie Frye is gorgeous. 11/10 Would fantasies with Evie being my grilfriend again, anytime.","November 19, 2015","true","39.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"

The GPU load will often go between 80% and 90% but so far no area (regardless of what was happening on the screen or the weather) made the fps dip under 60. I have no idea if this scales down to lower end cards very well or not, but for my particular use case I'm not dissapointed (the game looks the part for what it's squeezing out of the graphics card). I will duck points for the top tier features nuking the performance though, and lack of more lightweight AA options such as SMAA. A choice between FXAA and 2xMSAA+FXAA is hardly a choice. Bugs and glitches have basically been nonexistent (only one graphical bug in 7 hours of playing, a minor one at that and zero gamebraking bugs or anything immersion breaking). Overall I'd rate the technical aspects somewhere along the lines of a 7.5/10 since at the time of writing the physics are locked to 30fps and it really doesn't look good when the rest of the game is running at 60fps. I hope they'll fix that soon.\n\nGameplay- it's pretty much the most refined AC game I played yet (I haven't played Unity mind you). Traversing London is very enjoyable, the place is huge and I barely scratched the surface of it. The option to play as either Jacob or Evie (save for some character specific missions) is a very nice touch and I like being given a choice here. The combat can actually be hard and you're not an unstopabble killing machine, at least not in the beginning. This makes the upgrades actually meaningful, and as a result the combat gains a lot here. I'd rate it at something along the lines of 9/10\n\nAudio- Excellent, it really gives almost a tactile feeling to what you're doing in game. The voice actors do a good job (at least from what I can tell) and the music is nice and appropriate.\n\nOverall I find the game very enjoyable and apart from that 30fps physics lock there have been no technical difficulties that would take away from that enjoyment. It might be that Ubisoft learned from their mistake with Unity and released a better polished product or they just got better in implementing their technology. In any case for what it is now I can without a doubt recomment this game, with just a word of warning that you need a beefy machine to run it.","November 20, 2015","true","27.2"," 23 of 45 people (51%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","51","23","45","2","2"

As a result, I didn't expect Syndicate to be fun when I purchased this game, I simply bought it because I had the money at the end of the year and it was on sale (sort of). However, in my opinion, Syndicate is the best AC game so far. The game really emphasizes the personalities of Jacob and Evie, how their goals differ, how they argued and competed in a sibling rivalry way, and this really touched my heart. Ubisoft really stepped up their game (literally) and put in effort in the development, which is something that I have never felt in Unity. I liked their idea of liberating the city in another way, the blackbox kills, the city of London with her bustling engines and carriages, and their most interesting side missions involving historical figures yet (even though this has been done before in previous games, Syndicate did the best job). It seems like Ubisoft has finally realized their failure in the present-day storyline and has chosen to deviate from it quite a bit in Syndicate; to many this is even worse but to me it showed me that Ubisoft has realized their mistake and is now trying to fix it by using only short cutscenes instead of meaningless playthroughs, and this is a good start (cutscenes still show instereting story).\n\nI was so drawn into this game that I completed the game in merely two days (two days, but I have 24 hours on record in two days), and I am by no means saying that the game itself is short even though it can be made longer. For me, the ending is not amazing, but it is by no means bad at all unlike IGN's review. As a fan, I dare say that I have moved on from Ezio, and that Jacob and Evie are my new favorite assassins. And yes, the Season Pass is worth the money for many reasons.\n\nPros:\nCharacter development\nStory\nEvie's outfits\nNew & fast paced combat system\nUnique and cool-looking weapons\nGood graphics\nCarriage riding and chasing\nTwo playable and (mostly) switchable Assassins\nCity liberation missions\nAssociates of the Brotherhood\nTwo types of NPC's: Aggressors and Protectors\nYour gang that fights for you\nSibling rivalry\nRope launcher\nNew leveling system and skill tree\nBadass, mobile Assassin Hideout\nSmoothed parkour/free running\nAmazing background music and soundtracks\nKidnapping people\nBig yet useful world (unlike ACIII's frontiers)\nBritish accents\n\nCons:\nJacob's outfits\nNo co-op\nCan only wear hood when crouched/stealthed\nMicrotransactions still here even though not necessary\nPoorly managed weapon rewarding system (missions unlock weapons w lower stats)\nNo significant difference in the skill trees\nEvie's cape's animation (didn't notice until I saw other reviews, but yes it is like 20fps)\nMinor glitch in the inventory where they mark some equipments as new items even though I have had them for a while\n\nOverall, 9/10. Best AC game so far, good story, strong characters, new level systems, weapons, and skilss. Definitely would recommend. Season pass is worth it (for the first time).

The mechanics are a good mix of the best of Unity and Black Flag making the game feel more responsive and updated with the good stuff from Unity (run down button thank you!) while retaining a lot of what worked in Black Flag.\n\nIve not played enough of the story yet to fully comment but 8 hours in and its so far compelling and gives a sense of purpose that was lacking from Unity.\n\nWhile Jacob is fun and has a good sense of smart ♥♥♥ humor. Evie is the real star of the game. From her voice acting, to character design to her animations, she stands out among the lineage of Assassins. She looks very commanding when leading the gang and ordering them to attack, her stealth kills are great and her cane sword animations add finesse to counter Jacob's brute force tactics. Combined they are absolute stars. The interplay and the cheeky sibling rivalry chemistry is well done by the voice actors.\n\nLondon is just massive and epic in scale. Where Paris was big and cramped, London's "Modern" feel is well designed, from the wide streets that look just on the cusp of beign populated with Model Ts to the tall buildings that dwarf even the tallest cathederal in previous games.\n\nAll in all a good addition to the series and not at all dissapointing like Unity. If you are a fan of the series its worth the money. Here is hoping for more good characters like Evie and Jacob.","December 12, 2015","true","49.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It fixes many of the bugs of the last ones and London, which has been recreated, looks amazing and is a joy to explore. The gameplay is fun and exciting the new grappling hook makes getting around London so much fun. The new characters are great Jacob and Evie are my faviortite assassins since Ezio and there voice acting brings them to life so well. And with the large amount of content you get your moneys worth (espically if you are a completionist like me). Despite all the great things this game brings to the table it has its issues, one of the main things being that it changes NOTHING in the AC formula. This game is almost exactly the same as all the previous AC games and that is really disappointing the age old issues still appear here as well; the wall climbing is not fixed meaning there are times when jacob/Evie make a movment wrong and get caught or killed and this is extremly anoying, also the world content is very much the same thing over and over (I have also heard they ruin the end but I am not there yet). Overall this game is great despite all its flaws and is well worth getting!","November 27, 2015","true","71.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This has such a good mix of fun, systems and style. This game is a lot of fun to play. Fighting is more brutail, more bare knuckle. Less style than swordplay of the previous. Story is great so far. The time period is one of my favorites, and the fact that your home base is a moving train adds an element of immersion. Being able to even sit back and watch the sights was a cool treat as well. The gameplay is great. Less buggy and more stable than Unity. The rope launcher is awesome. It's nice to kill a templar surrounded by others blinded by smoke and zooming out of there in a moments notice. It's more automatic and adds to the excitment. And latesly the timescale is a welcome change. It was odd in previous games to have to set the time of day via the options.

I was really glad when Ubisoft decided to retain the "Unique Kill" mini-requirements, allowing some more cool looking assassination cut-scenes if you know what you're doing, as well as allowing the player to just forego them and go with another strategy. (Just in case you might want to just directly head to the traget or just outright distch stealth and go kill everyone in the target area.) Although, the return of the "optional objectives" is still a majestic pain in the ♥♥♥♥.\n\nSecond, the battle system. The ever so powerful counter attacks combined with the new, powerful spammable stun attack makes things pretty easy, with only the fast pace of the fights being the only challenge, as you will still have to time your counters, stuns, and combos.\n\nThird, the story. Ubisoft finally improved from their previous hijinks with Unity, and made gold material with Syndicate's story. That said, you might want to buy the game yourself if you ever want to find out, as I do not want to throw around spoilers like misplaced christmas gifts.\n\nFourth, the level grinding. Just go find a fight club around levels 5-8, keep winning it, and you'll reach level 10 in no time. I actually reached level 10 before sequence 4, complete with the necessary equipments.\n\nFor now, this is all I can say about the game. And I sincerely did not regret buying it.","December 4, 2015","true","94.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frostrck/recommended/368500/","frostrck","FrostRCK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frostrck/","59 products in account","First of all, let me start by stating that I have beaten the game (all the story missions and boss battles, but not all the side missions) and I have never felt so compelled at writing a review for a game, but Syndicate is different.\n\nAs an AC fan who has played every single AC game except for Rogue, I lost a lot of respect for the AC franchise after Unity due to its poor character development, crappy storyline, and glitched gameplays. As a result, I didn't expect Syndicate to be fun when I purchased this game, I simply bought it because I had the money at the end of the year and it was on sale (sort of). However, in my opinion, Syndicate is the best AC game so far. The game really emphasizes the personalities of Jacob and Evie, how their goals differ, how they argued and competed in a sibling rivalry way, and this really touched my heart. Ubisoft really stepped up their game (literally) and put in effort in the development, which is something that I have never felt in Unity. I liked their idea of liberating the city in another way, the blackbox kills, the city of London with her bustling engines and carriages, and their most interesting side missions involving historical figures yet (even though this has been done before in previous games, Syndicate did the best job). It seems like Ubisoft has finally realized their failure in the present-day storyline and has chosen to deviate from it quite a bit in Syndicate; to many this is even worse but to me it showed me that Ubisoft has realized their mistake and is now trying to fix it by using only short cutscenes instead of meaningless playthroughs, and this is a good start (cutscenes still show instereting story).\n\nI was so drawn into this game that I completed the game in merely two days (two days, but I have 24 hours on record in two days), and I am by no means saying that the game itself is short even though it can be made longer. For me, the ending is not amazing, but it is by no means bad at all unlike IGN's review. As a fan, I dare say that I have moved on from Ezio, and that Jacob and Evie are my new favorite assassins. And yes, the Season Pass is worth the money for many reasons.\n\nPros:\nCharacter development\nStory\nEvie's outfits\nNew & fast paced combat system\nUnique and cool-looking weapons\nGood graphics\nCarriage riding and chasing\nTwo playable and (mostly) switchable Assassins\nCity liberation missions\nAssociates of the Brotherhood\nTwo types of NPC's: Aggressors and Protectors\nYour gang that fights for you\nSibling rivalry\nRope launcher\nNew leveling system and skill tree\nBadass, mobile Assassin Hideout\nSmoothed parkour/free running\nAmazing background music and soundtracks\nKidnapping people\nBig yet useful world (unlike ACIII's frontiers)\nBritish accents\n\nCons:\nJacob's outfits\nNo co-op\nCan only wear hood when crouched/stealthed\nMicrotransactions still here even though not necessary\nPoorly managed weapon rewarding system (missions unlock weapons w lower stats)\nNo significant difference in the skill trees\nEvie's cape's animation (didn't notice until I saw other reviews, but yes it is like 20fps)\nMinor glitch in the inventory where they mark some equipments as new items even though I have had them for a while\n\nOverall, 9/10. Best AC game so far, good story, strong characters, new level systems, weapons, and skilss. Definitely would recommend. Season pass is worth it (for the first time).

I do need to note that I did skip Unity (I played Rogue instead) and there might be issues/positives which I dislike/like that are present in Unity.\n\nPROS:\n+This is the most Assassin's Creed game to date. It's a sandbox and there's stuff to do in it. It reminds me a lot of Brotherhood, but with more in it.\n+Combat has clutter cut out and looks brilliant as ever.\n+Graphics are good. It looks like London.\n+The new "zip-line" gadget which channels Batman is a welcome addition. I'm guessing somebody at Ubisoft really wanted the Hooksword to come back and meant halfway with this.\n+The banter between Jacob and Evie is good. They share lines of dialog which resemble actual brother and sister conversations.\n+For the majority of the game you can play as either Jacob or Evie without having to change, but, as you'll see below, this is a con when examined below the surface.\n\nMIXED:\n+/- All the historical figures in Syndicate were shoved in at the last minute. I am most certainly not the first to point this out, but it's so obvious and must be pointed out more. They all have thier moments, very bizarrely timed moments (except for the one from WWI and Karl Marx, who can best be described with a neon sign above their heads), but none have a central role to the story, such as Leonardo Da Vinci did in previous games. In an uncanny cycle, each historical figure shows up and knows Jacob and Evie, which is weird the first time and dreadfully unnerving for the rest since they are supposed to be a part of a secret order of assassins. It sucks because many of them can be outright cut out of the game and be replaced with just ONE of them. Like Leonardo, that single figure could be a mentor/friend to the assassins twins.\n+/- Also, every single other character in the game other than Jacob and Evie feel tacted on. Yes, I mean EVERY other character. They are simply there to fill a reputation grind role. Oh, and if it wasn't for one good line of dialog between Ned (the transgender character) and Jacob, Ned would have been the most token character of the bunch; yet, if there was going to be a token character, it'd actually be Karl Marx, who's contribution to the game and plot are far less. It's funny because all of these characters have unique voice actors and some artist put their work into making them all look different, but, again, like the historical figures, each character has a moment here and there and each can be replaced by just one.\n+/- There aren't enough side missions when conquering London. Sure, there are enough to make it fun, but I feel like there should have been more considering there's a scene set in... Well look below, it might be a spoiler, but it won't be if you actually think about it.\n\nCONS:\n-No co-op. You'll understand why this is a major issue because....\n-....the difference between playing Jacob and Evie is almost nill. Both have 3 perks which are exclusive to that character and, as I discovered when unlocking them, the only good ones are with Jacob because they relate directly to combat. Evie's relate to stealth, yet stealth has never been difficult or important in Assassin's Creed, which is a tad ironic if you think about it.\n-There are collision bugs here and there. Within the first 10 minutes of playing, I managed to accidental get Jacob stuck in the ground.\n-The chases in this game are utter garbage and poorly designed. Tell me if this sounds logical: A child below the age of 10, a woman w/ heels who was hypnotized, and a man who did not have a head start can OUTRUN Jacob for several minutes. It doesn't.\n-Ubisoft, please... STOP IT WITH THE FRIGGIN' FUTURE STORY! I do not care for those two idiots who helped Desmond and Lucy. They aren't well written. They aren't important. They aren't fun. THEY ARE BLOODY USELESS! I thought the future plot in Rogue was bad, but Syndicate takes the cake because it really, REALLY feels stitched on to an otherwise okay plot set in London.\n-Okay, this might be a little spoiler. You have been warned. Anyway, at one point you see a tear in the simulation (damn you real world!) that leads to a future setting: World War I. Sounds good, right? It isn't, because it's SOLE purpose is to, you guessed it, tie in MORE future stuff. Remember that woman from AC3? Juno was her name, and she's now some machine spirit in the internet. She shows up, explains what she's done (aka stuff you already know and don't care about) and you kill the Sage from AC 4: Black Flag again. That's it. There's no purpose for going to World War I other than getting more terrible exposition you already know from a character nobody cares about.\n\nIn conclusion, the majority of issues that I personally had with this game can be summed up as: Ubisoft, stop it with the future ♥♥♥♥ because nobody likes it.","February 1","true","30.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

The new combat and movement systems work great (having a hookshot is something I've wanted in an AC game for a while), and even after finishing the 20 hour main story, there's plenty of fun to be had. Despite this, the story is kind of meh in comparison to the Ezio and Kenway Family trilogies.\n\nDefinitely not Game of the Year by any means, but I definitely got my money's worth with this game. 8/10.","December 14, 2015","true","21.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/frostrck/recommended/368500/","frostrck","FrostRCK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/frostrck/","59 products in account","First of all, let me start by stating that I have beaten the game (all the story missions and boss battles, but not all the side missions) and I have never felt so compelled at writing a review for a game, but Syndicate is different.\n\nAs an AC fan who has played every single AC game except for Rogue, I lost a lot of respect for the AC franchise after Unity due to its poor character development, crappy storyline, and glitched gameplays. As a result, I didn't expect Syndicate to be fun when I purchased this game, I simply bought it because I had the money at the end of the year and it was on sale (sort of). However, in my opinion, Syndicate is the best AC game so far. The game really emphasizes the personalities of Jacob and Evie, how their goals differ, how they argued and competed in a sibling rivalry way, and this really touched my heart. Ubisoft really stepped up their game (literally) and put in effort in the development, which is something that I have never felt in Unity. I liked their idea of liberating the city in another way, the blackbox kills, the city of London with her bustling engines and carriages, and their most interesting side missions involving historical figures yet (even though this has been done before in previous games, Syndicate did the best job). It seems like Ubisoft has finally realized their failure in the present-day storyline and has chosen to deviate from it quite a bit in Syndicate; to many this is even worse but to me it showed me that Ubisoft has realized their mistake and is now trying to fix it by using only short cutscenes instead of meaningless playthroughs, and this is a good start (cutscenes still show instereting story).\n\nI was so drawn into this game that I completed the game in merely two days (two days, but I have 24 hours on record in two days), and I am by no means saying that the game itself is short even though it can be made longer. For me, the ending is not amazing, but it is by no means bad at all unlike IGN's review. As a fan, I dare say that I have moved on from Ezio, and that Jacob and Evie are my new favorite assassins. And yes, the Season Pass is worth the money for many reasons.\n\nPros:\nCharacter development\nStory\nEvie's outfits\nNew & fast paced combat system\nUnique and cool-looking weapons\nGood graphics\nCarriage riding and chasing\nTwo playable and (mostly) switchable Assassins\nCity liberation missions\nAssociates of the Brotherhood\nTwo types of NPC's: Aggressors and Protectors\nYour gang that fights for you\nSibling rivalry\nRope launcher\nNew leveling system and skill tree\nBadass, mobile Assassin Hideout\nSmoothed parkour/free running\nAmazing background music and soundtracks\nKidnapping people\nBig yet useful world (unlike ACIII's frontiers)\nBritish accents\n\nCons:\nJacob's outfits\nNo co-op\nCan only wear hood when crouched/stealthed\nMicrotransactions still here even though not necessary\nPoorly managed weapon rewarding system (missions unlock weapons w lower stats)\nNo significant difference in the skill trees\nEvie's cape's animation (didn't notice until I saw other reviews, but yes it is like 20fps)\nMinor glitch in the inventory where they mark some equipments as new items even though I have had them for a while\n\nOverall, 9/10. Best AC game so far, good story, strong characters, new level systems, weapons, and skilss. Definitely would recommend. Season pass is worth it (for the first time).

Not only is this game an insult to the senses in every way imaginable, the gameplay, the story, the recycled characters most notably Jacob Fry who is just a mix of Edward Kenway and that guy from Watchdogs no one remembers. The creators with Ubisoft at the helm have seemingly grown tired of anything that resembles quality or joy in their products and rather is scarily close to turning into Stalin of the game world, a position currently inhabited by their self-proclaimed enemy and biggest competitor - EA. They ♥♥♥♥ all over their users with the most notable example with Unity in which they released an unfinished product at full price, and only offering compensation several months later after a massive backlash extremely rarely seen among consumers, but forcing customers wishing to accept the peace offering that they could not anytime in the future sue Ubisoft over Unity.\n\nAnd with this stinking pile of garbage they have not only put together a cliche-filled, gameplay-broken, lazy approach to gaming by taking the standard template they seem to just be recycling for every annual game, but they have more importantly completely "forgot" to optimise it after release since it after all was a much better release than Unity in that it was actually playable upon release. UBISOFT - this has been said way too many times already that it borders on customer service cliché, but I have a sincere hope that there is still some good people left at your companies who believe the magic and beauty in beautifully crafted games. That games are not only a way to pass the time and shoot some bad guys, but that can enlighten and broaden ones minds and transport oneself to a different world, a different time. I must believe that is what the creators of AC 2 were embodying when they created what is, in my opinion not only the finest AC game to be released, but one of the best sci-fi games of this generation. You got everything right: the location, the story, the gameplay, the sidemissions, the graphics, the music - and most importantly, you respected your audience in delivering something to be proud of, and something you felt your audience deserved. For those responsible for that piece of art - I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart.\n\nAnd to those who have become mindless robots churning out what has - UNFORTUNATELY - become a yearly tradition of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ all over audiences, I will never forget, but I still have hope you will redeem yourself before this franchise finally runs out of steam. Finally, I just want direct my attention to the head of Ubisoft - Yvet Guillemot (or how its spelled). You sir are responsible for what have befallen this beloved and excellent franchise, and you will ultimately have to answer to all those fans you have dissapointed time and again, and who miracelously come back for more every single year, myself being one of them, because they still have hope that the franchise might one day be great again. Chances that you'll ever see this I release is close to none. But hopefully, when enough people complain and force your eyes open, you will see what you have become.\n\nI hope for that day.\n\nVERDICT: 6/10","February 9","false","32.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","2","4","2","0"

There’s no beating around the bush here. No softening the blow. Combat in Assassin’s Creed is a miserable, tedious affair. As much as I love running across rooftops and scaling towers and just feeling like a badass assassin, I just can’t get over how lame the combat remains after all these years.\n\nI realize it probably hasn’t changed much because Ubisoft sees Assassin’s Creed as its big, annual cash-cow. Why fix it if it ain’t broke? But that’s a dangerous mentality. People will start losing enthusiasm over a series that comes out every year when all that changes, in any meaningful way, is the setting.\n\nWith games like Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor out now, which borrows some from the Assassin’s Creed formula but improves exponentially on its combat system, there’s really only so long that Ubisoft can continue putting off a combat overhaul.\n\nAnd if the publisher/developer is worried that more casual fans would be put-off by a more demanding and engaging combat system, they could easily have difficulty modes like many other games (though this risks making the hard mode just frustrating rather than hard.)\n\nI just imagine an Assassin’s Creed, with its big, beautiful open world, pared with the combat of Shadow of Mordor or Dark Souls, and my heart weeps. Because as I play Syndicate I just can’t get over how easy and boring the combat is, how lacking the enemy variety is, and what a shame and waste that is for gamers and the game’s designers alike.\n\nTime to shake things up. Time to really make a change with this franchise. The only game in the series I’ve seriously enjoyed in years was Black Flag—a truly wonderful pirate game. But even that entry could have benefited greatly from combat that was as compelling as its ships and setting.\n\nMaybe next year? While lots of high scores might assuage any doubts Ubisoft has about the franchise, I can’t help but see interest waning from down here at ground level. Certainly I can’t see how such high scores are even being given out to a game that has been widely critiqued for the same failures year-over-year.\n\nEven just fixing combat would probably make critics go crazy with hype. The reward is worth the gamble.","January 5","false","25.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

This is my first Assassin's Creed game so I didn't have experience coming into it from previous games. The game play overall was really interesting. It was fun to pick skills and such though it was a little disappointing that by the end I had gotten all the skills for Evie and Jacob. However, the various mini-games were fun diversions and especially liked the Fight Club. Other notable things were encountering some fun characters from history, HQ on a train and the immense feel of London.\n\nWhere the love came was from Evie. I thought she was really well written and definately the most interesting character between the twins. I really enjoyed the interactions between the two but Evie seemed so much more interesting and fleshed out.\n\nI didn't find the controls as game breaking so a bit sluggish here and there.

Who doesn't love roaming through Victorian London for hours on end? Much better than visiting the real modern city. It looks great.\n\n- Karl Marx is hilariously represented here as some kind of liberal democrat. I loved those side missions despite the ridiculous historical inaccuracy. Hardly a complaint, though, because no serious person learns about history from video games.\n\nCons:\n- It's way too easy. One of the few times I died was when Jacob hit a tree and fell off his zipline. I was hoping for some proper battles in the gang wars, but I finished most of them in less than 30 seconds, usually without even getting hit. It is particularly easy when playing as Evie; most of the enemies died after one or two throwing knives. Maybe I levelled up the characters and the Rooks too fast? I doubt it, because the gang battles with recommended levels of 9/10 were just as easy.\n\nThe fight with Starrick is also too easy, for a final boss fight. It took me longer to catch the Spring Heeled Jack in the Charles Darwin side missions than it did to beat Starrick.\n\nOverall, I like it, enough that I'll buy the Jack the Ripper DLC soon to squeeze a bit more out of it.","May 10","true","73.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

The game just gives me the Assassins Creed Syndicate splash screen, and doesn't even load the game. I tried everything. I've tried reinstalling it on my main drive. I tried verifying game cache. I've tried all the advice I can find online, my computer meets the system requirements. I know this isn't just me because it's happening to many people.\n\nAs far as I'm concerned I shouldn't even be spending hours trying to fix a problem when I'm the one buying the product that I expect to work when I purchase it and not have to spend hours trying to fix it, then shortly after I find out there is no fix. (That may vary)\n\n\nCongratulations on being one of the laziest game publishers/developers ubisoft, really fantastic job.  You possibly wasted 65 of my precious Dollars , and many hours of my time. because of your lazy attitude towards your customers.\n\nIf this is how you treat the continued loyalty of your customers and fans of the Assassins Creed franchise I honestly hope Vivendi completely buys you out and runs you into the ground.","June 3","false","0.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197963541953/recommended/368500/","76561197963541953","Rüdiger Rügenwalder","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197963541953/","158 products in account","Biggest AC fan from the beginning, played the first games like crazy. Quality started to decline dramatically with Revelations and hit a low with Unity. That brings us to Syndicate.\n\nI had huge hopes for Syndicate. It seemed like they were trying to improve a lot of things. The gameplay did actually improve quite a bit. It's like the Assassin's Creediest Assassin's Creed in that matter.\n\nHowever, the story is hard to follow, because you don't get emotionally attached to the main characters a lot. They're trying to pull of the same things over and over again, but they just aren't pulling through. The problem with the series is that they try to get so much detail by adding open houses, a lot of foliage and decoration and a lot of historical facts. They fail to add detail to the characters and especially the people surrounding you, though.\n\nTake Black Flag as an example. The Jackdaws crew was just there. You neither had to find a steerer, a cannoneer, a carpenter nor the bloody Spanish cook, that was mentioned in the book. Image you would've had to actually put together a crew and take actual care of your men or women. The same goes for the rooks in Syndicate. You have a couple of important persons on your team, but they're too distant like the other captains in Black Flag and it's not like you'd actually care about that fat lady in the chair.\n\nAlso, you don't get attached to the main characters. In Assassin's Creed III you had at least a little attachment to Connor. You saw his parents, you saw him growing up, you experienced his childhood horrors and his relentless way of becoming an Assassin. Sure, you cannot top Ezio in Assassin's Creed II. You experienced the whole process of him growing up from a cocky teenager who didn't know anything about the world to a caring and calm adult. Whilst you knew every single one of your allies by doing stuff with or for them. The recent AC titles lack this sort of dedication to the main characters.\n\nThen there's just too much content. Ubisoft emphasises the amount of playable content in the latest AC games, starting with Black Flag. According to Ubi, you were able to spent 80 hours in Black Flag until completion. Well, but do you want to? At least 40% of the completion rate is just farming chests and other collectibles. This part became even bigger in Unity, where you could find almost ten different items throughout every single district. In my opinion that is no content at all. It doesn't affect me, my playstyle, the story line or the character development. If you're on the first playthrough and try to get full sync in the missions, you can make it through Black Flag in 16 hours and that is fine. But advertising and fooling players into buying the game through a cheap trick like posing collectibles for content won't make for a great game.\n\nAnd finally the technical part of Syndicate. Making a game that's full of details and that has sophisticated graphics is one thing. Making a game that can be run on a normal PC or console with a smooth experience is another. Not being able to play a game on full settings has been used for ads once, especially with Crysis. But that time is long gone. I've been trying to run Syndicate on a 4x3,5ghz processor, 16gb HyperX Fury and a GTX980 and I'm actually getting bluescreens. Bluescreens? That was the first bluescreen I've ever seen on the new Windows! Even on medium graphics it's just slow, buggy and glitchy. Especially horse carriage missions are horrible. Just like in Watch Dogs, the game cannot load the next parts of the map fast enough.\n\nWell, Mr Smartass, can you even make a game that meets your tremendous demands? Yes, you can. Take the Mass Effect series for example. Mass Effect 3 looked pretty good at that time and it ran smoothly even on a ♥♥♥♥ing laptop. I've played the demo at the CeBit a couple of months before the launch of ME3. All they offered us were ASUS gaming laptops, but you were able to push settings to max and get your full 60fps without the computer even getting loud. And you were attached to all those charakters throughout the entirety of the series. You will remember Admiral Anderson, Liara and Garrus for the rest of your life, wont you? But you'll have forgotten about Jacob and Evie long before you play your last games.\n\nYou don't need the best graphics, the best story or the best gameplay to make a great game. All it takes is a good idea and the best you can do out of it. The latest games of this series however, Assassin's Creed Syndicate included, just lack passion and heart. And if you know a little about the development of these games, then you know why.","June 4","false","19.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kasser/recommended/368500/","kasser","Kasser","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kasser/","196 products in account","I have finished the main storyline, some side quests, around 30 hours gameplay time and I levelled up the character to level 9 (highest is 10).\n\nWhat's impressive+ Detailed city landscape of London during the Victorian Era.\n+ You get to meet some famous figures that are rarely seen in Video Games such as Charles Dickens.\n+ The ending song "Underground" is really good.\n+ The grabbling hook is useful and fun to use with the high towers in London\n+ The twin heroes (Jacob and Evie) have better personalities than AC3 and AC:Unity.\n\nMeh (could have been better)- Stealth mode is more improved here. However, all what you can do in Stealth mode is crouching. Could have been improved with more moves like taking cover and do a quick roll between covers. Or simply ditch the Stealth mode away since AC was never about being sneaking slowly.\n- Driving carriages is good for reaching far objectives in London. It is however not that fun to drive. The chase scenes are awkward and unrealistic.\n- The weapons and fighting style is probably the weakest in the whole series. It feels unresponsive and when surrounded by too many enemies it just become a mess and random.\n- The Skills Level Up menu is probably a new thing to this series (not sure if this was in Unity). You now earn XP to unlock points and assign them to a specific skill. However, this feature is completely unnecessary. It simply means the assassins in this game are unskilled. They could've just improve the characters every new chapter just like Edzio or Altair when they unlock new weapons or new skills.\n- Microtransactions. While you really don't need them, but the idea of pay-to-win in a single player do annoy the player and takes him out of the experience.\n\nThe Bad- The game feels like it is missing a plot. If you want to play it for the plot, just watch the ending straight away and skip the game.\n- Too many repititive side-missions. In order for your "gang" to control an area, you will have to do 4 kinds of missions again and again: Kidnapping a wanted gang member, assassinating a templar officer, freeing enslaved children or simply killing every gang member in a specified area. You get to repeat this process dozens of times. The only challenge here is that some enemy gangs can be on a level higher than you which they will be able to inflict higher damage on you and they will have longer health bar.\n- The Train Hideout does not feel as impressive as AC2 hideout or as useful as AC4 ship. A huge missed oppurtinity here.\n- Weak cast of side-characters on both the Assassins side and the Templars.\n\nPerformanceThe game has been played on GeForce 780 GTX (3GB of GDDR5) with i7, 12 GB of RAM and Windows 10. I tried the game on both 1080p and 2k resolutions. The game do not maintain 60fps easily as I had to lower some graphical settings. Meanwhile, Witcher 3 (another open-world game) do run better on my machine. I think the game is not optimized. However, it do run better than AC:Unity. I also had multiple crashes that usually happen after the end of a chapter or some quests.\n\n\nFinal wordsHave you ever tried copying ideas in Art class from the next guy? AC Syndicate feels just like that. It tries to copy features from other games like Arkham Series, Far Cry, Hitman, GTA and so on. Ubisoft should have taken its time and re-perfected the Assassin formula just like they did with AC2.\n\nIf you are new to Assassin's Creed, avoid this game and get one of the older ones (I recommend AC1. AC2, AC4).\n\nIf you did not like Unity then you would say the same to this game.\n\nIt is safe to watch the ending and skip this game.","June 5","false","31.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

It felt like they moved the slider from 0 to 10 and deliberately decided to stop around 7 this time and not to do a game as good as they could and should have done it.\nThe interiors, for example. In the previous game, Unity, you could enter almost any building. In Syndicate the whole center of London is just copy/pasted boxes a la GTA III instead of houses with detailed interiors with the exception of mission related buildings. Which are few.\nThe graphics certainly are amazing, the architecture is significantly better looking and more interesting to climb and explore compared to GTA V, but if you compare it to Unity, it's definetely a step back. The controls are typical for AC series and that's annoying that developers fail to make an enjoyable combat mechanics for the 9th bloody time. For example, I was aiming my revolver at the charging enemy and just as I was ready to shoot game switched me to melee mode and I had to use a quickshot with a separate button. The story is abysmal. No character development, no twists, uninspired cameo appearances of Marx, Dickens and few other historic figures become a boring routine. You're just told from the start that Assassins are good, Templars are bad, and you stab them in their backs one by one til the end credits roll.\nBut I've managed to get a good deal of enjoyment out of Syndicate. However I cannot recommend this game. You see, Ubisoft is company with attitude, bad attitude that is. And I hope that the deepest most unpleasant place in Hell is reserved for them. Every once in a while game stops working. For no apparent reason. The horrid U<don't>play service is like a gatekeeper which stands in front of you every time you launch the game and flips a coin to decide if it's gonna let you play or not. And as I type these words, the game freezes on splash screen forever 'cause The Dreadful Crimes DLC broke it and Ubisoft are in no hurry fixing the issue.\n\nP. S. I'll change my rating to positive when I'll be able to play the game again.","May 29","false","146.5"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","10","20","2","0"

That whole freerun+E=Down and freerun+Space=up is just a f*cking mess. I miss being able to jump where I want, whether I kill myself or not let me have FREEDOM!\n\nBut the worst part is the "stealth" (which they claim). There's no f*cking stealth.

This is the worst pc gaming experience,  steam is great but uplay is just terrible. Ubisoft dosent think before they make a pc game.\nFirstly it NEEDS to be on your c: drive to work, or even launch (I figured this out after 3 separate hour downloads )\nSecondly if you can get past the first issue your graphics cards NEEDS at least 3gb of ram and ubisoft determines how thoes are distributed so for example if you have a msi gtx 960 with 2gb expect to play on the lowest setting and get about 3fps, which is just unplayable. How is this when the same card can handle everything else out there at 60fps with settings on ultra ( fallout 4, mgs 5 phantom pain , witcher 3 for ex.) It just a waste of money unless you have both a large C: drive and a graphics card with 3gb or more.\n\nLastly I can't believe how many good reviews this got for the two reasons mentioned about it took me hours to figure this ♥♥♥♥ out because no one will give an honest review. Eff uplay and eff ubisoft I'm not giving them even a dime of my money anymore. It seems there only focused on getting your money and not the product their pushing out which is subpar and shotty.

They both like to state incredibly contrived logic like "Don't let personal feelings jeopordize the mission" despite the fact that the only reason they are in London is because they disobeyed their superior and botched their other mission.\n\nAlso the Henry x Evie romance is the absolute worst forced romance I have ever seen in a game. And Henry himself is just about the most ♥♥♥♥ing useless and unneeded character in any game. He exists to create tension for Evie, that is literally it. And he ends up being the one who "Saves" both Jacob and Evie in the most convoluted manner imaginable.\nA character who is supposedly immortal gets stabbed by Henry, now he's all of a sudden mortal? ♥♥♥♥ off Ubishit.\n\nCombat is so incredibly easy on everything but enemies who are at least twice your level, and then they only kill you in one hit, they don't get new gear or better at fighting, they just take longer to kill and instantly gib you if you fail to press the counter button after the game flashes a big yellow "I AM GOING TO ATTACK" signal above their head. And that brings me to my first actual complaint; Why the level system? It's fine to do that with the main character, gives us some progression, but giving enemies metric asstons of health doesn't make your combat harder or better, just slower. And blocking off areas of the game with simply "harder enemies" doesnt ACTUALLY stop people from doing these missions that you are trying to keep us from doing. Which ends up being for no reason at all because we can't equip certain items that we got as rewards for these "difficult" missions until we reach an arbitrary "level" which only increases once you have spent enough "experience" to buy skills.\n\nThat being said, Victorian London looks ♥♥♥♥ing amazing, and the clothing is pretty awesome to look at, though why Jacob is incapable of wearing a hood AND standing up is ♥♥♥♥ing beyond me.\nThe weapons are all pretty cool, but the clean and smooth combat animations of AC 2 are long and dead, and replaced with overexagerated choppy animations where you end up teleporting either yourself or the enemy within a certain distance in order to see the same execution animation for the 1200th time.\n\nThe story is the same copypasta bull**** that you've seen for like 5 times now. Templars bad, Assassins good, kill templars to prevent them from getting another made up piece of Jesus memorabilia, kill enough Templars so you can get to the big bad Templar who usually isnt actually a bad guy and is trying to use Jesus memorabilia to make the world a better place, kill him anyway, then dont use Jesus memorabilia because it's "Too dangerous". The Fuc*ing End.\n\n\nTLDR: ♥♥♥♥ Story, ♥♥♥♥ Characters, ♥♥♥♥ Combat, ♥♥♥♥ Game\nBut hey, at least the game is playable this time around amirite?

The zipline fix for the weak parkour is only useful to go up a building, rather than crossing over building to building which is just bad. It is slow and clunky.\n\nNow onto the story and characters. They're bad. The present is pretty much missing so far from my playthrough (I'm on Sequence 6 [last mission] of 9 and have only seen I think 4 cut scenes that are only a few minutes long) Ubisoft seems to be trying to fire back at the SJWs and saying "see. we're equal" by having a male and female character, but if you think about what is said about the characters and look at what they're doing the characters are confused with each other, don't grow, and overall defocus, but if you take into account both the story that we see and the mechanics what you'll see is that the developers over-compensated and gave Evie more brutal finishers, more of a variety of finishers, a love interest, a possible one, while her activities in the past are what are important to those in the present. Further the Mary Sue qualities mixed with them ripping on Jacob which are idiotic because they're not thought out (which is doubly bad since that is the criticism evie has of Jacob) which ends up saying things that tries to make the player sympathetic to horrible things/people or just does make sense when you're looking at what is actually happening.\n\nUbisoft, overall, did a diservice to the franchise in whatever their goal was. It runs and looks better than Unity which isn't hard, but that probably as a lot more to do with its stripped down nature than anything they did special while the option to switch between Evie and Jacob might seem appealing it makes little sense in the game world and all elements of the game would have been better, by how much I don't know, if they cut Jacob out as a playable character, transfered his missions to Evie, and cut all of the "Clean up Jacob's mess" missions.\n\nI reccomend to get this game if you really want to see what's happening in the universe or want another map for AC stuff, but considering it isn't numbered and isn't a main series title, and can be said to be fairly lacking I say give it a pass if you're looking for inovation, cleaner mechanics, a good story, because they're not here... If you're new to the series I recommend getting an earlier game rather than this one, but if you want to start here it is neither a great nor terrible experience... just not worth $60 imo for what they did and a sub-par entry overall in the series.","December 3, 2015","true","61.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

NOTE: AC4BF hanya memiliki perairan yang luas tapi tidak dengan daratannya dan itu adalah hal yang diharuskan untuk game tsb which is pretty boring menghabiskan banyak waktu di kapal,\n+ GANG, adanya system gang membuat game ini SEDIKIT lebih berwarna, walaupun ini bukan hal baru, karena ACR-pun memiliki hal seperti ini, ubisoft membangkitkan kembali dengan beberapa hal YANG SEDIKIT berbeda walau terkadang membosankan dan USELESS tapi ya ini mengingatkan akan game Assassin's Creed favorite gue (ACR).\n+ UNLOCKABLE SKILL, EQUIPMENT, dan WEAPON yang bervariasi (banyak)\n+ KERETA KUDA. untuk hal ini ga akan gue jelaskan dan lo harus mencobanya sendiri, LOL\n+ MAIN dan SIDE MISSION yang cukup banyak untuk diselesaikan, JIKA dilihat dari HARGA game... hal ini sangat diperlukan dan juga REPEAT-ABLE\n\n- AI yang belum stabil, hal ini membuat gue cukup pusing dan kerepotan terutama untuk membuat walkthrough , dan ini AMAT SANGAT MENGGANGGU (butuh PATCH baru)\n- USELESS 100% Sync. semua challenges yang ada pada game ini disetiap missionnya terlalu mudah untuk diselesaikan dan cukup boring karena variasi yang sedikit (judul yang berbeda, dengan cara yang sama), 100% sync (disetiap MAIN dan SIDE MISSION) dapat diselesaikan dalam FIRST TRY dan lo tidak perlu walkthrough untuk hal ini, kadang gue pun menyelesaikan challenges nya tanpa gue sadari.\n- BANYAK MISSION, VARIASI SEDIKIT. yang gue rasakan adalah seperti memainkan mission yang SAMA dengan JUDUL BERBEDA bahkan hingga posisi musuhpun sama, perbedaan jumlah musuh akan membutakan lo pada hal ini, tapi jika lo sedikit lebih detail dan mengulang setiap missionnya puluhan kali dengan ratusan RESTART lo akan menyadari hal ini.\n- STUTTERING STUTTERING STUTTERING STUTTERING STUTTERING , ini BENER-BENER mengganggung dan ngeselin terutama untuk freeze 4-10 detik, ngga ada FPS drop, hanyak STUTTERING yang gue rasakan bahkan ketika gue sett semuanya di LOW. WTF. DO SOMETHING UBISOFT!! (NOTE: gue menggunakan patch v1.21, dengan i5-4690k - 8GB RAM - GTX 780 Ti SC edition)\n- ENDING dalam story yang "UDAH GITU DOANG?"\n- EFEK pada SKILL, gue hanya merasakan sedikit perbedaan SEBELUM dan SESUDAH semua skills ter-unlock. bahkan gue merasa tidak ada perbedaannya sama sekali setelah gue unlock.\n- MISSION BUGS / GLITCHES. gagal tanpa sebab ketika lo mereplay missionnya (yang gue temukan hanya pada SIDE MISSION) adalah HAL TERKONYOL yang pernah ada, dan lo perlu menunggu 3-7 kali agar lo bisa memulai mission nya.\n- TERLALU BATMAN.\n\nya itulah pengalaman yang gue rasakan ketika memainkan game ini ratusan jam (wasting my time). mungkin pengalaman yang lo rasakan akan berbeda dari gue karena sesungguhnya setiap orang memiliki komponen PC yang berbeda dan pemikiran yang berbeda.\nsayangnya karena masalah STUTTERING yang benar-benar mengganggu gue, gue harus memberikan rating NEGATIVE untuk game ini, mungkin setelah masalah ini teratasi atau dengan menculnya PATCH baru yang berhasil meng-FIX STUTTERING ini gue akan mengubahnya review ini menjadi RECOMMENDED (POSITIVE). MUNGKIN!\n\noverall, apakah game ini layak untuk lo beli? TERGANTUNG, gue hanya akan memberi masukan: BELI GAME INI KETIKA SEDANG DISKON 30-50%. trust me! untungnya gue beli saat 40% OFF jadi ya ga rugi-rugi banget walau ngerasa rugi.

Was overall an enjoyable story of where I became attached to the characters inside that game. Despite my disappointment of the overall game mechanics AC Syndicate makes up those mistakes and has given me faith into another Assassin Creed game. The story is quite refreshing, but I do believe it fell rather short. Many of the sequences in the game felt anti climatic towards there position in the game and I believe that some of the characters that were introduced into the game like Miss Nightingale only came into the game about 3 or 4 times depending on your mission agenda. The voice acting on the other hand was much like assassin creed revelations. It was outstanding and I felt the need to really care about Evie and Jacob Frye. I grew attached to the twins and I do hope that the next Assassin Creed game will bring in a new Dynamic of displaying two assassins. They do not have to be twins but it would be nice to have two personalitys to play to. AC Syndicate is a breath of fresh air and am looking forward to the next Assassin Creed. I do recommend you sink in as many hours into the game as possible :P","December 3, 2015","true","45.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The game itself runs fine: I get around 40 - 60 FPS in the open world (with no stuttering) on the high preset on an R9 280X, which is decent (could be better mind you, but I've played worse). There are some drawbacks, however: graphics settings are pretty limited (e.g. no anisotropic filtering, anti-aliasing is limited to nasty FXAA and MSAA combinations, can't turn off any of the post-process stuff), special/Gameworks graphics settings are nearly broken on Radeon (and apparently some Nvidia) cards and some cloth physics are limited to 30 FPS, which sounds anal as hell but you'll know exactly what I mean when you play it.

They completly scraped the idea of a Multiplayer both coop and versus.. And i got to say this is one of the better Assassins creed games.. Clearly seens as there lack of focuse haven't take place here and the singleplayer has a big world for you to enjoy.. With exploration, Plenty of interesting missions.. Small side tracks to take on.. Even the upgrade has interesting features..\n\nOnly thing I dont seem to like is this whole GANG.. Idea.. Not that its bad just that.. Your never declared leader of that gang.. You never talk to anyone in charge of that gang.. That gang kinda just exist.. And you all of a suddenly after beating up a guy got everyone following you with no cutscene or even voice over explaining why they suddenly went.. Yea he's our leader..  And this is freaking the hell out of me.\n\nOther then that.. The combat has been vamped up a bit.. Adding level.. And health bars and gone away from this.. Press E to kill ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.. you can still one shot Low lvl people or with stealth.. Also the Stealth system is diffrent.. Better? Worse? It's depends on what it ask of you.. Some times its awesome.. Sometimes your seen even tho you clearly are hidden..\n\nTwo playable main characters.. They are a little diffrent but in general i felt almost the same playing them.. They got some special skills only they can pick and some extra dmg with specifc weapons..\n\nI like this game.. It's a 7/10.. Could been a 8/10 perhaps even a 9/10 if they had a good coop.. I know if they added a coop perhaps the game be broken as unity.. but i still want it.. And this story had potential as you play as two characters.. And both characters are pretty much involved in every cutscene and mission.. Just that you become the one you accepted the mission as.. Some missions are specific for the character but not that many..  Still if you liked Assassins creed games before.. Like blackflag, Brotherhood.. THen this will probedly spark something you like as well..","December 3, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The story is more developed than the last few AC games, and the different parts and actors around the city map are nicely tied together into the 1870's theme. Victorian London fits the AC fmechanics like a glove.\n\n--The movement/fighting mechanics are the same as what you're used to. Nothing new to learn.\n--New side activities that can be done and repeated over and over at any time which help to earn money and level-up skills quickly. This includes boxing, carriage racing, hijacking supplies, destroying cargo, robbing trains, and a few others.\n--Good character development and voice acting. It's easy to like the characters you'll be playing.\n--Familiar historical figures to interact with.\n--Trains and trains stations.\n--A much needed grappling hook gun to make getting around easier and faster.\n--This takes place in Victorian London and it actually looks like Victorian London.\n--A good number of outfits and upgradeable gear to choose from\n\nEven without turning on the game breaking highest of the high super graphics settings, the game still looks pretty good. You play as either the sibling male or female characters Jacob and Evie Frye, mostly choosing which one you want at any given time - though there are a number of missions where you don't have a choice. Jacob is more of a witty brawler and Evie is methodical stealth, though if your a casual gamer it won't make much difference to your play style. You'll end up playing the one you like to look at and listen to the most and still come away satisfied that you haven't missed anything.\n\nUnlike AC3 which lacked a bit in the city department, London feels fully stocked and without filler buildings that are obviously fillers, and it has plenty of decent options of moving around the map how you choose other than fast travel. The addition of a Spiderman-like grappeling hook gun found in the main story is very easy to use and a welcome time saver to teadiously climbing up tall buildings to try and overcome the distance of running everywhere.\nThere's plenty of prompts as you move about and fight to indicate what's going on, what you can do, and where to go. You won't waste those few precious hours of free time after work each night just trying to figure out what the game wants from you.\n\nSome historical figures are thrown in and offer some side missions. They feel more like extended cameos than necessary content, but it's a nice diversion if you need one. Ubisoft's political and ideological slants are there as always, but it could have been much worse. The little jabs they take are mostly in the written text content of the collectables menus and not in the spoken character dialouge.\n\nYou main base is on wheels - a train - and it's constantly moving aorund the city. You can fast travel to it whenever you want.  The trains and carriages around town are a really nice change to the series. If you're feeling adventurous you can easily hijack a carriage, pull up next to an enemy carriage, shift to the roof of it, and jump around between the two vehicles as you duke it out with the bad guy. There's a number of little fast paced Hollywood bits like this to keep it interesting, but you can take it or leave depending on how you feel.\n\nThe map is divided into boroughs which you conquer like previous AC games. Do all the side pieces (takeover a stronghold, rescue people, etc) and you'll finish up with a gang war to take to borough. You'll fight the goons in the boss fight and then take on the boss, but you have the choice of taking the boss out before the final gang war which makes it easier on you.They progress in difficulty, and if you do even just a few or the varied side missions and activites a number of times (particularly the boxing ring) you'll earn decent money and level up at a rate that fits the story as you play it, allowing you to stay just a little bit stronger than your next objective.\n\nI was worried about stability, but I didn't find any major bugs or game breaking problems. I know this has been a problem for some people.\n\nPeople have rightly pointed out that Ubisoft seems to have dumbed the difficulty down, but for the casual gamer who enjoys the AC franchise, there's a lot here to keep you happy.","December 4, 2015","true","45.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The overall world is great, i live in London and I feel they really nailed the atmosphere and astetic however in terms of gameplay Syndicate really falls down.\n\nThe AI is terrible, it's truley awful. You can engage a guy in combat and less than 100 meters away thier friends wil not notice the fight. You can throw dynamite near a group and they will not flinch, explode it and others are not alerted unless it's in thier field of view. Guns work almost the same because the AI has almost no reaction to sound.\n\nAdded to this when guards are alerted the do very little to hunt you down and quickly revert back to passive state, you kill 3 guys they will be alerted for a short period of time and then quickly act as if nothing happened.\n\nThe AI is so broken that it destroys challenge and immersion for me, the things I have metioned have a huge impact on gameplay.\n\nAlso I feel that variety in stealth is very limited, you cant do as much as a game like black flag so it makes gameplay stale.\n\nThis wouldn't matter so much if the story was interesting but it really isn't, there is almost no decent story. Characters are generally flat and thier motivations limited to being very shallow. I liked AC4 because of Edward kenway as a character, he was genuine and funny. Evie and Jacob are dull and uniteresting, for example they go to London on a whim, no reason or explanation.\n\nHonestly It's just not a fun game, maybe for the first few hours but then you realise how flawed and dull this game actually is, theres no gameplay, lack of focus and other than it's visual assets a generally dull game.\n\nI spent £24 in a sale, but honestly I wouldn't even call that value for money.","February 14","false","12.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The story is more developed than the last few AC games, and the different parts and actors around the city map are nicely tied together into the 1870's theme. Victorian London fits the AC fmechanics like a glove.\n\n--The movement/fighting mechanics are the same as what you're used to. Nothing new to learn.\n--New side activities that can be done and repeated over and over at any time which help to earn money and level-up skills quickly. This includes boxing, carriage racing, hijacking supplies, destroying cargo, robbing trains, and a few others.\n--Good character development and voice acting. It's easy to like the characters you'll be playing.\n--Familiar historical figures to interact with.\n--Trains and trains stations.\n--A much needed grappling hook gun to make getting around easier and faster.\n--This takes place in Victorian London and it actually looks like Victorian London.\n--A good number of outfits and upgradeable gear to choose from\n\nEven without turning on the game breaking highest of the high super graphics settings, the game still looks pretty good. You play as either the sibling male or female characters Jacob and Evie Frye, mostly choosing which one you want at any given time - though there are a number of missions where you don't have a choice. Jacob is more of a witty brawler and Evie is methodical stealth, though if your a casual gamer it won't make much difference to your play style. You'll end up playing the one you like to look at and listen to the most and still come away satisfied that you haven't missed anything.\n\nUnlike AC3 which lacked a bit in the city department, London feels fully stocked and without filler buildings that are obviously fillers, and it has plenty of decent options of moving around the map how you choose other than fast travel. The addition of a Spiderman-like grappeling hook gun found in the main story is very easy to use and a welcome time saver to teadiously climbing up tall buildings to try and overcome the distance of running everywhere.\nThere's plenty of prompts as you move about and fight to indicate what's going on, what you can do, and where to go. You won't waste those few precious hours of free time after work each night just trying to figure out what the game wants from you.\n\nSome historical figures are thrown in and offer some side missions. They feel more like extended cameos than necessary content, but it's a nice diversion if you need one. Ubisoft's political and ideological slants are there as always, but it could have been much worse. The little jabs they take are mostly in the written text content of the collectables menus and not in the spoken character dialouge.\n\nYou main base is on wheels - a train - and it's constantly moving aorund the city. You can fast travel to it whenever you want.  The trains and carriages around town are a really nice change to the series. If you're feeling adventurous you can easily hijack a carriage, pull up next to an enemy carriage, shift to the roof of it, and jump around between the two vehicles as you duke it out with the bad guy. There's a number of little fast paced Hollywood bits like this to keep it interesting, but you can take it or leave depending on how you feel.\n\nThe map is divided into boroughs which you conquer like previous AC games. Do all the side pieces (takeover a stronghold, rescue people, etc) and you'll finish up with a gang war to take to borough. You'll fight the goons in the boss fight and then take on the boss, but you have the choice of taking the boss out before the final gang war which makes it easier on you.They progress in difficulty, and if you do even just a few or the varied side missions and activites a number of times (particularly the boxing ring) you'll earn decent money and level up at a rate that fits the story as you play it, allowing you to stay just a little bit stronger than your next objective.\n\nI was worried about stability, but I didn't find any major bugs or game breaking problems. I know this has been a problem for some people.\n\nPeople have rightly pointed out that Ubisoft seems to have dumbed the difficulty down, but for the casual gamer who enjoys the AC franchise, there's a lot here to keep you happy.","December 4, 2015","true","45.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The game itself runs fine: I get around 40 - 60 FPS in the open world (with no stuttering) on the high preset on an R9 280X, which is decent (could be better mind you, but I've played worse). There are some drawbacks, however: graphics settings are pretty limited (e.g. no anisotropic filtering, anti-aliasing is limited to nasty FXAA and MSAA combinations, can't turn off any of the post-process stuff), special/Gameworks graphics settings are nearly broken on Radeon (and apparently some Nvidia) cards and some cloth physics are limited to 30 FPS, which sounds anal as hell but you'll know exactly what I mean when you play it.

They completly scraped the idea of a Multiplayer both coop and versus.. And i got to say this is one of the better Assassins creed games.. Clearly seens as there lack of focuse haven't take place here and the singleplayer has a big world for you to enjoy.. With exploration, Plenty of interesting missions.. Small side tracks to take on.. Even the upgrade has interesting features..\n\nOnly thing I dont seem to like is this whole GANG.. Idea.. Not that its bad just that.. Your never declared leader of that gang.. You never talk to anyone in charge of that gang.. That gang kinda just exist.. And you all of a suddenly after beating up a guy got everyone following you with no cutscene or even voice over explaining why they suddenly went.. Yea he's our leader..  And this is freaking the hell out of me.\n\nOther then that.. The combat has been vamped up a bit.. Adding level.. And health bars and gone away from this.. Press E to kill ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.. you can still one shot Low lvl people or with stealth.. Also the Stealth system is diffrent.. Better? Worse? It's depends on what it ask of you.. Some times its awesome.. Sometimes your seen even tho you clearly are hidden..\n\nTwo playable main characters.. They are a little diffrent but in general i felt almost the same playing them.. They got some special skills only they can pick and some extra dmg with specifc weapons..\n\nI like this game.. It's a 7/10.. Could been a 8/10 perhaps even a 9/10 if they had a good coop.. I know if they added a coop perhaps the game be broken as unity.. but i still want it.. And this story had potential as you play as two characters.. And both characters are pretty much involved in every cutscene and mission.. Just that you become the one you accepted the mission as.. Some missions are specific for the character but not that many..  Still if you liked Assassins creed games before.. Like blackflag, Brotherhood.. THen this will probedly spark something you like as well..","December 3, 2015","true","11.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is unique, because you can switch between two characters most of the time and you are given a batman like grapple tool... What more could you ask for right?\n\nThis game is also less tedious than the other assassin creed games I've played. It's not like there's over 70 view points. It's not like you have to kill guards all the time, etc.\nThis is one of those games that looks amazing, has a great story which may even teach you a thing or two, is historically accurate, has decent combat which you for the most part cannot just faceroll ( at least not until you get the best gear in the game...) and even has enough rpg elements without feeling like a grind...\n\nI usually get bored of ''tripple A'' titles in less than 40 min. This is one of the few games I've played for about 50-70 hours and gotten 80% completion in. And after all that, I can confidently say it was worth the time.\n\n","December 20, 2015","true","44.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Everyone is saying that unity was bad and this is the lifesaver, but thats what they said with unity, and no doubt they will say so again with thier next game. Plus I'm annoyed that they took out multi-player, it was a funny experiment which I thoroughly enjoyed. I've got a decent computer which all the others worked fine on, but this one was a killer. Its 34 gigs and I live on the edge of the world with the crappiest internet, it took me three solid days to dowload, with nothing running in the backgound, and for what. A ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game running on 10fps.\nAlso I have a general annoyance with the whole franchise. This is NOT a stealth game, although it is thought of as one, trust me, it isn't. You are basically an omnipotent being, you can climb faster, fight better, withstand more damge then any normal person could take and suddenly heal whenever you are walking down the street and not beating up petty street thugs, which were minding thier own bussiness until you came along and killed them. Now everything I just listed is basically in every modern AAA game today, and thats fine, I like it that way. But when you pretend a wolf is a sheep you can't just put wool on it and expect people to feed it grass in a petting zoo. No, it shouldn't be the character that is good, it should be the player, back in the dawn of videogames people enjoyed failing, they enjoyed dying horribly at the final boss then starting  again from scratch, and what do we have? Twelve year olds that still haven't had their first growth spurt looking up cheats because the couldn't demolish the boss in 10 seconds and therefore gave up. So the CEO's of today's leading videogame maker companies sat down and thought to themselves "Hmm, I better make this game easy or no-one will play it, oh! I know! We'll give the main character badass climbing and fighting skills that would take several decades to master then make him/her 19 years old!"\nNow call me a turd and put me in the catergory of "Yet another one of those old farts who can't let go of the original thief trilogy and and mock the new game." But the thing is I'm fifteen, and I didn't even know those little jewels existed, infact I only discovered them after finishing the reboot and thinking what a great game it is before searching it up online. Then I found the original games and took my opinion on a sharp round-about before going in the other directoin. Why? Because I realised that those old things  were better. They understood the concepts of stealth, no, they invented the concepts of stealth, they didn't make you omnipotent, you couldn't throw yourself off  a four story high building and expect to survive, you couldn't kill everyone with a single slash, and above all they did not give you gadgets such as a weird gun thing to go from one end of the map to the other. No, you were as good as dead the minute you abandoned the stealth approach, you couldn't say balls to the wall and start slaughtering everyone in the room the minute you were discovered.\nSo if you've read all the way to the bottom of my review  you can now see why I am not utterly amazed by this giant hoax unlike millions of other people, and know the reason why the assasins creed syndicate will never make it on to my all time favourites shelf.\n\nAlso there's no ships. );","December 13, 2015","false","4.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I guess... Now hear me ramble...\n\nAssassin's Creed\nThe first game, was amazing, with never before seen freedom of movement, it looked fantastic and the concept was very original. Yet the game felt like a... proof of concept, fantastic for a demo, but I wasn't ever on the edge of my seat... It turned out to be quite repetitive and only had a mediocre story. Still... I completed it, searched for all the damned flags... I don't know why, but I did.\n\nAssassin's Creed II\nThe second game, was groundbreaking in it's own way, but the story was again quite superficial and the Desmond storyline already started to annoy me. I got tired of the first civilization, the pieces of Eden, all that stuff. Finished it and finished Brotherhood and Revelations as well, just to be sure I got everything out of Ezio.\n\nAssassin's Creed III\nAC3 was a bit less enjoyable. It was getting prettier and the controls became a bit more refined and a few new additions made it worth playing. The main problem was again the story... especially the Desmond stuff...\n\nAssassin's Creed IV: Black flag\nBlack flag certainly made waves... har. Sailing the Caribbean and plundering ships, was really fun at first, but after a few hours this also became quite repetitive, this sadly is no Sea Dogs. The story was mediocre again, Kenway was superficial and cliché, but a welcome improvement to AC3, I must say... No Desmond storyline anymore... sort of... exiting the Animus however was annoying yet again. Still, the pirating made the AC series feel more interesting again. I must say that battling the legendary ships was pretty fun!\n\nAssassin's Creed: Unity\nAfter the black flag... the black sheep... Unity... and yet... for some reason this really capture my attention. I didn't have any bugs, no technical problems and a DLC for free, so I didn't have reasons to complain. I think it still looks amazing, much better than Syndicate for some reason... And as a plus, outside of the Animus, there was little to nothing to be done, great! The piece of Eden crap was also less intrusive and apart from making the rest of the game very easy, it didn't really have that much of a negative effect on my experience. The facial animation was sublime, the mocap worked like a charm and the actors could really have supplied this game with a boost... if only the story and the dialogues were any good. Sigh... Another wasted opportunity... I'll come back to this game when the DLC gets cheaper. I really don't want to spend more money on a few more generic missions, but I'd like to spend more time in that gorgeous city... Oh and I wished one of my Steam friends had played it cause the co-op missions are a blast with good players!\n\nAssassin's Creed: Syndicate\nFrakking Syndicate... I've completed 7 AC games with mixed feelings... still I would prefer to rant about this game than to play it... bad sign. The story is... absent... isn't it? Characters are paper thin; they don't have any motivation, their dialogue is stupid, etc... Oh... I did like that top hat...\n\nThere was no need for technical innovation in this game, Unity is gorgeous, the engine proved to work... well... after a few updates... There's no change in game mechanics; Unity's were sublime... Did they spend that production money on the same brilliant art direction? Syndicate looks artistically less refined than Unity... so I guess not. Yes they built a new city... great... but Paris looked more impressive, much more detailed and more diverse... so where did the money go? Story? Nope... Level design? (From what I can tell so far) Hell no... Oh yeah... the carriages... that must have set them back a few pennies...sigh\n\nIt's likely Ubisoft's way to get some of the money from Unity back... no innovation, no big investments this time… maybe they really only worked on it for a year... Unity probably cost a hell of a lot of money ($150 million) and had a disappointing release (still in my opinion it was (at least technically) as much a milestone as 1, 2 and 4. Syndicate... isn't at all). But if Ubisoft released this to cover some losses, all fine by me. But I just wished they spent a bit more attention on story and character development... Just imagine what could be done in this period... Of course... then I remember friends of mine saying they don't really watch the cinematics... don't really care about the story... etc... the main audience will be happy with the action, so no matter what city AC is set in, it will sell... so why invest more... ?\n\nI'm not happy about that though... it has SO much potential... the framework is close to perfect! The writers and director from say "The last of us" would make this game a juggernaut!\n\nSigh...  I hope they rearrange their priorities a little bit... Make it a more story centric game... they could still push in as much free running as they want... I especially hope the next AC game doesn't have anything to do with the pieces of Eden... Why not simply use the Animus technology to get first hand accounts of important historical events and sell it as historical adventures? I just hope they get the story problems solved before they ever make Assassin's Creed Japan. Because not making it, would be less damaging to me than making a bad one.

Last year I gave a very heated and long review to the terrible game Assassins Creed Unity, and this year I will be giving a review of Syndicate. I had so much hype for Unity and almost none for Syndicate, I almost didn't buy it. So you can imagine my astonishment when I found out it was an extrodinary game. It gave me everything I wanted from an Assassins Creed game and more. It's so insanely fun, with a suprisingly long story and a giagantic map that I promise you'll get lost in. I just completed the campaign (no spoilers) and it was awesome. It wasn't anything extrodinary but the plot was, I would put it "very good" not amazing. You get so used to the rope launchers and the horse drawn carriages that you forget what the other AC's were like with out them. In fact, I just closed out of Black Flag and Unity to see how it felt in comparison. Terrible. The answer is terrible, it feels terrible to not have the equipment that you do in Syndicate. The combat was awesome, it was fluid, hard but not ridiculously hard, this time you can actually dodge bullets instead of just  being a meat sheild (looking at you Unity) and the weapons are so creative. Your fists, which are actually really fun to play with and they have awesome new takedown animations for, the cane sword which is pretty badass just from the name alone, and then, my personal favorite was the Kukri knife, which ended up being something I played with almost the entire game. Even after finishing this game, I feel like I've  barely scratched the surface, you can conquor burrows of London, which is something I did within the first 3 hours, but trust me, it doesn't feel rushed or short or anything. Even when there aren't any missions you can go to my personally favorite burrow, the Thames and run from ship to ship blowing them up! Get this game, you really should. It gave me everything I wanted from ACU. Think of it as Assassins Creed Unity 2.0, if this game had been released a year ago then their would be a hell of a lot more people playing it.","November 28, 2015","true","55.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Jacob and Evie's different personality and play style offers so much more experience than previous games. The parkour was somewhat the same as unity, although this time they added the grappling hook (not to be confused with the hook blade of course) for easier navagation, since in the late 1800s, roads are wider. At first I thought that would just killed the entire parkour experience AC fans loved so much about, and even though i understand why the grappling gun was neccessary and that it's just a game, I still find it weird at times how this physics defying tool can exist in victorian london. But trust me, without it you will be miserable in this game. I just think the game developers can come up with a more realistic/ better navagating tool for that period, or at least limit the features like gliding upwards with your hand.\n\nThe covering system/ stealth mode is quite nice, although since they got rid of the "enter cover" button i sometimes am not sure if i am in cover or not, but trust me, it does not affect your stealth play one bit, in fact it's an improvement. And one of the things i like about this newly installed AC game is the enter stealth mode feature. Wearing a hood all the time makes you look more suspicious doesn't it? especially in an era where its not a fashion trend. So they added the feature where jacob and evie will only put on their hood when you're entering stealth mode, jolly good!\n\nIssues with the game:\nI'm playing this game on my MSI GS60 gaming laptop, i got a intel core i7 6700 HQ cpu and an Nvidia GTX970m with 16 gs of vram. I thought this is more than enough to play the game, but I encountered some problems when launching the game.\n\nIssue 1: Full screen/ windowed problem.\nMy screen supports 4K, but as you gamers know playing on 4K requires much more than what I have, so when turn the resolution down to 1080p, the game wont let me enter full screen, to fix this simply click on the diplay option and select "borderless fullscreen"\n\nIssue 2: Frame rate drop\nNow i know this is a graphic demanding game, but come on I got a GTX970m.... sigh oh well i will admit gaming on a laptop, you win some you lose some. But to fix this issue just turn off ambient occlusion, you really cant tell much of the difference, and set your anti aliasing to FXAA. Overall, depending on your gaming rig, if you are like me, or close to mine, set your graphic preset to high instead of ultra, gaming on ultra for this game you probably need a better gaming rig than what i have.\n\nIssue 3: ACS auto select GPU as integrated GPU\nSo like i said I got a GTX 970m, but my integrated GPU is of course ♥♥♥♥♥ier, a intel HD 5000 or something like that. After I install the new Driver from GeExperience for my GPU, ACS suddenly uses my integrated GPU. son of a ..... anyways, to fix this, just find nvidia control panel on your computer, select manage 3dD settings, program settings, and then select ACS as the program you want to customize, and then underneath it select your prefer graphic processor as "high performance nvidia processor". It worked for me. Also like to point out all my other games like Fallout 4, ACU, Far cry 4 have no issue with this, so maybe its something to do with the game. I have no idea.\n\nIssue 4: Game crashes/ stopped working after a while....\nAll i can say for this, is to play the game as admin, locate your game in your steamapps file, right click on ACS icon, play as admin, ever since i did that, no crashes for 2 hours of gameplay. so..... yay....i guess....\n\n\n","March 11","true","88.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Thank you ubisoft for actually listening to feedback and putting an effort into a PC Title you deserve my dollar for this one and i hope the rest of your upcoming titles have the same effort put into them.\n\nPros:\n-The story starts off with abstergo but so far i have played it, all the abstergo ♥♥♥♥ that nearly made me die of boredom in previous titles is all cutscenes that dont take long and puts you straight into Jacob and Evies shoes right afterwards. No 4 hour long origin story which takes 7 chapters just to start wearing the assassin gear.\n-Very good textures and Lighting (occassional render pop ins and low res textures however it is open world and the scale of the world makes up for it)\n- Performance is solid (GTX 980 - I7 4790k - 8GB RAM) i run it on ultra highs besides having PCSS off and using base high shadows, HBAO + and not ultra, and TXAA x2. it seems the main performance eaters are the gameworks options so i have to turn them down a little or have them completly off like PCSS because it isnt worth the fps drop\n-Setting is amazing i really enjoy seeing London packed full of carriages, trains and people everywhere in a packed enviroment with tall buildings all close together.\n-Even the music just fills the game with more charm and goes well with the setting (Im from England so minor bias here)\n-Characters are so much better than in some recent AC games in my opinion with obvious weaknesses and strengths and just overall charm in cutscenes\n-Combat feels more fast paced and more challenging than previous titles where enemies seem more agressive and can block at any time. No more counter spam and then just LMB to kill everything which got boring as hell eventually\n-Customisation feels solid with many tiers of items like belts, capes, outfits, colours, gear, firearms and weapons to change with and upgrade\n-Zipline is a great addition and saves time and hassle but also is awesome to use when you jump into a carriage or assassinate people from it\n\n\nCons:\n-Really jarring low fps cloth textures like on jackets or capes of your character which i hope can be fixed with a patch because it is noticable\n-Cannot change motion blur in setting, when you use the carriage or zipline there is a huge amount of motion blur\n-You only get 3 choices of main weapons: Kukri, Cane, Knuckle Dusters. There are lots of variations but i would have liked to see maybe two handed weapons or just swords and other kinds of knifes for example\n- To follow on from that ^ would have liked to have the options of rifles instead of just a pistol, enemies use them however you cannot pick them up off of dead enemies\n\nOverall im pleased Ubisoft have paid attention to their mistakes and feedback and have changed for the better. i would say for the effort into putting out a solid port for PC and it is quite a fun, charming game on top of that it deserves a buy. I understand skeptisism because its ubisoft and i hated what they did last year but if they carry on like this i hope they earn the trust they once had back because they have proved they can make a solid title in what was a very terminal series.","November 21, 2015","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Jacob, while predictably cocky and sarcastic is still funny and likable, and Evie, the more serious of the two, is herself prone to moments of charm and levity. They're also superbly animated. It's not often a facial expression in a game will elicit an intended laugh, but it did here more than once. I liked both characters a lot, especially in the scenes they shared with one another.\n\nThe twins are often at odds with each other, too: Jacob wants to loosen the stranglehold of the Blighter gang and kill Templars, and Evie wants to hunt for a 'Piece of Eden,' a magical doohickey that grants eternal something-or-other. For most of the game, they're basically interchangeable to play: save for a few high-level abilities they have identical skill trees. Only near the end of the game do they really begin to feel distinct. Jacob is more of a brawler, Evie more focused on stealth, and crafting or unlocking gear like sneakier outfits or deadlier weapons can complement their respective toolkits. You can switch between them whenever you want in the open world, while story missions can only be performed by one or the other.\n\n:: FINAL VERDICT :: 66%","March 2","true","49.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

As I made my way across Westminster, zipping between rooftops with my rope launcher, a notice popped up indicating I was approaching a bounty hunt. The objective was simple--kill an important member of my rival gang--and I decided the children could wait a bit longer. I was in and out of the mission in under a minute after dropping hanging barrels on gang members, throwing down a smoke bomb and taking out the leader with a gun to the head. I ziplined out, stopping only once more to change my outfit to one that held more throwing knives, before dropping by a black market stall for a refill and dashing towards the factory.

Since I finally finished the game to 100% completion, I thought now would be a good time to write a quick review.  After the Unity debacle, it was a pleasant surprise to see Ubisoft get this one right.  There were still a few in game glitches (people floating off the ground, ladder rungs not directly attached to a wall, etc.) but nothing that was game breaking to me.  Overall the graphics are gorgeous, and the game is able to maintain good framerate on relatively high settings (running on single NVidia GTX980 card), with no hitching, lagging or stuttering.  Only once did my character get stuck (under a dock jumping into the River Themes) and couldn't get out.  But fast travel got me unstuck.  The only other glaring bug (at least for me) was that unlocking certain items late in the game like cloaks and outfits) caused the game to have a brain fart and crash.  But reloading the game put me right back where I was supposed to be with the new items in inventory.  As I have stated, some minor annoyances, but nothing I couldn't live with.  I don't believe that any AAA title you play nowadays (as complex as they must be to make) are going to be completely bug free.\n\nThe only thing I wish for was that Ubisoft put more into the story.  The number of story missions didn't seem to be any more in number than the side missions, and they tended to be very short at that.  In my opinion at least they moved in the right direction as far as the technical aspects and playability of the game are concerned.   I am now waiting for the season pass stuff to be released so I can jump back in.\n\nI know some people were wishing for a multiplayer feature, which as I understand Ubi decided against so they could concentrate on getting the single player aspect right.  Perhaps with the next Assassin's Creed game, they can maintain the same level of quality but expand on more story and multiplayer.\n\nOverall, I'm glad in light of all the positive reviews I saw on Steam from day 1, that I did not have to wait for a bunch of bug fixing patches and was able to buy the game right away.   I highly recommend this game for anyone who is a fan of the Assassin's Creed series.\n\nIf anyone from Ubisoft reads this review, all I can say is keep up the good work.  But don't forget that there is always room for improvement.  I feel, as I'm sure other gamers do, that I would rather wait for higher quality, playability, and a story that I can get into, versus an early-released, bug-riddled piece of eye candy.","December 11, 2015","true","444.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game manages to capture the good of the previous installments as well, getting rid of most of the unnecessary crap added since AC2.

Playing on ultra settings at 50+ fps smooth, no stutter (with a gtx 980 ti, intel i7-6770k, installed on a samsung evo 850 series SSD).\n\nGameplay: Enjoying the zipline mechanics, although they need to improve it because occasionally, I can't find a target to hook the zipline to even though I'm close enough. Progression in the game seems fine, I enjoy the stealth mechanics. The movement mechanics feels a lot like the older games (pre-AC unity) so it feels fast but sometimes unresponsive. It's quite frustrating when Evie/Jacob doesn't move the way you intend them to. Finally, I like the idea of a train being used as a base but it brings about many glitches, namely being positioned too far from your mission checkpoint.\n\nOverall, I think it's alright to get this game. If you really like the Assassin's Creed franchise, do get this, especially if it's on sale. If not, it's worth skipping this, I think Ubisoft needs to take time to properly improve the series. It's becoming repetitive and much like Call Of Duty (non-treyarch ones).\n\nP.s If you liked Ezio's character, you might like Jacob's >.>","May 15","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","0","0","1","2","0"

Fighting's become a lot easier than it was in Unity, bit too easy if you ask me, escaping a fight, though, is now kind of a challenge. I'm not sure if it was intentional, but enemies can apparently shoot through walls. Which is not cool. At all.\nThe city is gorgeous and climbing Big Ben actually beats sneaking around inside Notre Dame. The carriages are rather fun, too, until you get to the carriage races, which are based less on skill and more on luck and get very frustrating VERY quickly. My favourite part of the game though, was meeting historical figures, because those in 19th century England are better than Leonardo da Vinci in AC 2.","June 5","true","41.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I think. right now, until the day in the future that they actually solve my problem, I cannot recomend this game to anyone on Windows 10 PC.\nRight now, I feel like Im at a Casino sitting at a broken machine that just sucks in my hard earned money ... But in this case, no fancy lights and sounds... Just a logo of silence.","May 30","false","0.7"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","3"

Here are some of my pros and cons of the game now that I've played it more. I believe this review could really determine your choice on buying this game or not if you'll just stand the length of it. NO MAJOR STORY SPOILERS FOR AC SYNDICATE. I'M SPOILER FREE!!!\n\nPROS:\n-Gameplay\nThe gameplay by far is a major improvement from any other Assassin's Creed game. Instead of the copy-and-pasted "run up buildings and stab people" formula the AC series is used to, Assassin's Creed Syndicate offers more complex combat, parkour, and traversal systems.\n>COMBAT\nCombat has been made easier than Assassin's Creed Unity but not as simple as AC3, as I'm sure many of you should remember. If you have not played any previous AC games, this new combat system will be extremely easy to understand, as it includes having a strategy. A strategy as in "Should I stun this guy and bring him and his 3 friends for an epic multikill, or quick shoot all of them" There are many varietys in ways you could bring your enemies down.\n>PARKOUR:\nParkour hasn't changed much from Unity. The Free-Run Up and Down is still an option but the only major change in parkour, and I mean MAJOR change is the Rope Launcher. Ah the rope launcher. The latest hidden blade/gauntlet modification that made you the Batman of the 1800's. Except it doesn't. Unlike the speculation of many, the rope launcher is not directly ripped from the Arkham Games (you wouldn't believe me if I told you many thought this was the case) The Rope-Launcher doesn't zoom you up a building, it's almost like a rappel in which you hop on the sides of the buildings to your destination. This tool has made synchronization easier by lessening the hassle of climbing up those big dome buildings.\n>TRAVERSAL\nWays to travel throughout the massive open world of AC has massively changed. What used to be horses are now carriages, what used to be the Jackdaw is now a huge array of multiple steamboats. I know that's not even extremely close to a good analogy but regardless. Trains and steamboats all follow a path that goes to pretty much where you want it to go. All you have to do is wait. Maybe shoot some Blighters off of their enemy boats, or manage your gear and gang upgrades from you train hideout. Yeah, that's right, a TRAIN hideout. All those other hideouts the Assassin's had, Masyaf, Monteriggioni, the Homestead, an island, and wherever it was you hid in Unity, don't even compare to a TRAIN hideout. Carriages are pretty cut and dry. You hop in them and start riding around. Almost like a horse. Except for the fact that you can fight on the roofs of the carriages and wage battle with uncoming Blighters as they endlessly try to climb the sides to end your life. And then the carriage stops and Blighters and policemen are shooting at you and your stationary cart and climbing the carriage sides, AND trying to gut you while you flick them off like flies. Think of it as a zombie movie. The movies that have the main hero stand atop some rubble and fire all his rounds into a horde of zombies. Cool right?\n\n-GRAPHICS AND ANIMATIONS\nI've paired these two together so I wouldn't have to make two seperate categories. I don't know the full details of my rig but my gpu as of today is a MSI GTX GeForce 760 2GB. It sucks I know please don't hate. But the thing is, I can play this game on the *VERY HIGH* graphics settings pretty well. I recieve constant 45-50 fps and rarely have massive fps drops. Though once I get at least 2 hours into playing the game I start the drasticaly lose frames. Cutsenses lag and and animations are choppy, BUT THAT'S BECAUSE I'M AN STUBBORN LI'L ♥♥♥♥ WHO WON'T TURN THE GRAPHICS DOWN BECASUE I HATE FUZZY TEXTURES MAKING ME THINK I'M BLIND!!!! All I have to do though is restart the game and it goes back to normal.  But yeah if you have a nice rig going on, graphics should work great for you. This game has some of the best video game graphics I've seen this year on PC, and I'm not just kissing ♥♥♥ here. The facial features on the characters, the placement of facial hair, the detail that goes into the outfits and buildings. It's almost like looking at an actual person. This uses the same engine as AC Unity, and I can definetely see some recycled animations from Arno, but hopefully it shouldn't bother you too much. Also the new hood-up and hood-down system, also known as the new Stealth system, has arose some conflict in players saying they want to hood to be toggleable. But there isn't really a difference between Jacob with a hat and Jacob with a hood. The only animation that is different is that stealthy Jacob crouches. But otherwise, they both share animaitons. Leap of Faith, combat, sprinting, and parkour animation is all the same. So if you like the hooded Assassin look better, just hold down the sprint key and everything's fine.\n\n-CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT AND STORYTELLING\n(I won't spoil any of the story in this segment, I promise) The main characters are amazing. I can't even think of another word for the Unstopable Frye Twins. Jacob and Evie have a slight charm and humor to them that contrasts them from any other Assassin. Every single time Jacob spoke, I couldn't just not laugh at the sarcasticness and ignorance of his lines, and the tired but stern lines of his sister Evie putting up with his nonsense in a cute manner. The other characters that you meet throughout the game are also as exciting and full of wit. Everyone's character development, even the villian's, make this Assassin's Creed totally differrent by adding a great sense of humor alongside the action packed story. In fact, by Sequence 3 I had already got so attatched to the characters, that when a glitch occured that accidentely killed Evie, I was extremely sad. Like a new level of sad. You probably won't know what it's like to see the body of one of your favorite characters folded on the street curb, trampled by a horse. What was this glitch you might ask. Well I'll tell you.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n-ANIMATIONS AND BUGS\n(This will probably be the only category under cons, because me being a casual gamer, I haven't found anything extremely wrong with the game, just some things that may bug you if you buy it)\nAnyways...this glitch I was talking about. As I stepped off the carriage that Evie was riding in with me, I focused my camera angle on what was ahead of me but not behind me. I heard a whipping noise, than a neigh. I turned around to see the carriage I had taken zoom away, leaving behind the trampled ragdoll of Evie. The game then desynched me saying that "My ally was dead" or "Target Dead". I forgot. Leaving me heartbroken, the game then decieded to set me back to a position that I had played at least 5 min before and I had to redo everything. I'm sure there are many other bugs that I haven't found but I hope you enjoyed my story. ALSO. Another thing that may bother you is that Jacob and Evie, while in combat or assassinations, will use their right hands to stab their enemies. And it looks like they're using a hidden blade too. This only bothers me so much because as I recall, they only used their gauntlet blade for stuff like that. I've also noticed that no blade extends from the right sleeve. It looks like they are doing some sort of martial art death punch beacuse when the wrist makes contact with the enemy a spurt of blood spills out of the enemy. I don't think Ubisoft is going to fix this either because it's integrated into the cutscenes. I don't know if this will bother you so much that you won't buy the game, but just a warning.\n\n\nWOW YOU MADE IT THROUGH!!! GOOD JOB!!!!!\n\nFINAL RATING--------9.2/10\n\n\nSHOULD YOU BUY THIS? YES!\n\nSHOULD YOU HAVE PREORDERED THIS INSTEAD OF SAYING IT WAS GOING TO SUCK BECAUSE OF UNITY? YES!","November 19, 2015","true","42.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The graphics are superb, the performance is great, smooth as butter, and the story is compelling, because of the twins and the setting, that is the beautiful city of London and the Victorian time period. Combat mechanics are simple and fun, as always. Free run has been refined, and everything that is to expect from an Assassin's Creed game is there. I recommend it if you are an Assasins Creed's fan or this is your first Assassins Creed game. The experience is vastly superior on PC compared to PS4 or Xbox One, and my GTX 780 delivers a good performance, and uses only 4GB of RAM! For ultra details you'll need at least 4-5 GB of VRAM. Is playable on a GTX 780 with the highest details, but you'll see a lot of pooping textures and stuttering, but is three times better than the PS4 version. I play at high details, and the detail is sueprior too to consoles and with a frame reate superior to 40 fprs outside and 60 fps inside.\n\nOverall, I recommend this game. Is fun and interesting. Great and scalable graphics, great performance. There's microtransactions, but they are not necessasry and just pay-to-cheat. Not a downside in my books. Just ignore them.\n\nNow, I hated Assasins Creed III and that may explain why I'm so happy with Syndicate. No, I don't consider Black Flag part of the normal Assassin's Creed experience because of the ship and pirate stuff. More as an spin off, a  pirate game. I come from playing Assassins Creed III which I don't recommend, and this is a big upgrade on everything.\n\nShould you play it? Yes. It is worth full price? For me, yes, because I haven't played a good street based Assassin's Creed ever since AC II. But if you have played all past Assassin's Creed games there's no hurry on getting on the Syndicate wagon. This is the same as always, but way better.","November 18, 2015","true","35.9"," 11 of 26 people (42%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","42","11","26","3","1"

I'm refunding this game a second time sadly and I'm no longer gonna play AC games on the pc, sadly. It's just too much of hassle going through the troubleshooting steps when the game should work right when you load it up, just like every other steam game I own. I did buy the game on the ps4 though, and it's really fun if you still like assassin's creed games since 2. I haven't played much of Black flag or unity yet, but the main characters here seem to be way more likable than Connor who seemed way to bland to me.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis GAME DOES NOT WORK. this is infuriating because I went through an hour trying to get this game to run with different troubleshooting steps and  the game simply crashes at the startup screen. I've never had an issue where I've purchased a game before only to not work with the exception of Games for Windows Live games. I got this for half off from a sale and I really do want to play this game because I've played and see in it grow from the beginning up till black flag so far. If Ubisoft doesn't provide a fix soon, I might have to sadly return the game because spending hours trying to run it just isn't worth my time. This is how pc game was like before the steam era, but for the most part now you should easily be able to just simply download the game and run it (as long as you have the recommended or higher specs).","December 5, 2015","false","1.1"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","0"

Is the price reasonable? yes it is for $60.95  but the DLC Season pass is unacceptable . This is the main problem the microtranscation has got to stop at this generation , unlike star wars battlefront this game contents a lot of content which isnt repetitive and highly ripped for the season pass. So hows the FPS? Its a constant 60fps compared to unitys 40 but the graphics is somewhat demanding even for a high end so i suggest mid range computer to stay away!! Some people will have crashing and fps issues , i suggest check out the forums and steam pages for help as i have no problem.\n\nWhats good and new?\n- Victorian London Era setting\n- Interactive enviroment\n- New horse carriage transportation\n- The revolver pistol\n- Stealth Mechanic\n- Same unity fighting Mechanic\n\nIf you love unity you would like this game as its so similar in many ways , however if u miss the classic assassins creed counter attack rampage then maybe u might pass this. Its good but i might finish fallout 4 .

Full of so many bugs it isn't even funny anymore (like yeah the first one was, and you get around it by killing the boss before you get to the train bridge where it freezes. But after that it's all down hill). Don't waste your money on it because Ubisoft doesn't seem to care enough to make the right patches to fix / make sure to put out a quality game before releasing.\n\nLet's face it, Black flag was like the golden era and everything after has just been the down fall. I got so annoyed with the game I re-installed counter strike  instead (which I was surprised to see people still play).\n\nHere is the break down.\nPlot: semi ok, but then again I didn't get very far in the game due to bugs so I can't fully give a yay or nay.\nGraphics: graphics are good but only if you love lag. They didn't design the game right and it loads too much as you ride so it slows down. Also something is seriously buggy in the cut scenes.\nCombat: Good combo moves and not a game where you can just run all over killing everyone. Some foes are harder to beat at an early level.\nReward system: Similar to other AC where you level up as game goes on. Rewards are good and give you specials which is cool for each twin.\n\nover all rating 2 out of 5 stars (the extra star is for finally having a female lead character other than that silly side Chinese game).","January 2","false","9.5"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

Do I really need to keep going on?\n-The lamps don't look as good as they do in the order 1886.

We've got ourselves a Zipline Grapple Hook.\n-Can't use the Zipline Grapple Hook like Spiderman.\n-Evie and the other one both say they'll take on the mission in the cutscene. In the mission it's just one of them.\n-Loading screen looks better than the ACTUAL GAME.\n-Combat SUCKS. The older AC Games had combat that made you an action hero with swords, this just feels like your stabbing someone in the hands for a finisher move.\n-Instead of even trying, the outside animus areas are LITTERALLY CUTSCENES. VIEWED FROM A CAMERA. Wow, Ubisoft, you've realised your mistakes. Instead of trying, you just gave up.\n-UPlay.\n-Uplay rewards for this game suck.\n-Unput lag on everything but a analog stick. Way to limit my options.\n\nPros:\n-Game looks wonderful. Especially that loading screen.\n-Zipline Grapple Hook.\n-We can finally crouch. FINALLY. IT TOOK US SEVERAL GAMES TO ACHIEVE THIS.\n-Animations are phenominal.\n-Finally, no outside of animus areas that drag on.\n-Character can wear a top hat.\n-Characters look and sound amazing.\n-Sound design is much better, but some is stolen from Black Flag.\n-Finally, a chest opening animation that isn't lazy! It's a miracle!\n-Finally, some new animations! It's a miracle!\n-Carriages.\n\nOverall, if you're going to still get this game, just get it on console or if you've got a hand-me-down PC from TotalBiscuit.\nAnd a hand-me-down controller from TotalBiscuit.","March 2","false","10.1"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","14","1","7","0","0"

Then the game loading again, then red again, Even I restart the game cannot avoid this stupid bug. I cannot abort this memory either, since ESC does not work. I do not think Uibsoft really cares about the comment secion here. They just want to make money. The game such as Assassins' Creed cannot be produced so fast. Yet, for the sake of money, they produce it annually. Then, what I get is boring story lines, graphic bugs and loading bugs. Plus, one of the main character is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid and annoying. He is Jacob Frye. He can be an Assassin? That is hilarious. What he can do is only to kill people. He does not have or respect memory. He is stupid. But Ubisoft sets up a such character.

I really like the setting of Victorian London and Ubisoft didn't disapoint.They always do a fantastic job at detailing the world while also teaching you a bit about historical characters and events. The gameplay is also more along the lines of 2, were you have to take strong holds aroudn the map in order to unlock items/money.\n\nJacob and Evie are likeable enough (still no match for Ezio) and I enjoyed their story line. Although I still don't care for the modern junk they put in every game, it's just an annoying side part of the game in my eyes, I'd rather AC series didn't have it at all. Luckily the main quest did not have much of it, unlike some of the privous outings that overdid it (AC4)\n\nOne thing that really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off was the horse racing (and any time you had to run from AI which is quite alot) and the rubber band effect. If you've played any racing games, you know what I'm talking about. In Syndicate, there is no outrunning the AI, they are faster then you and they can aim very well and shot you from behind where you can't get them. Very frustrating.\n\nEvie also becomes super strong late game with her invisability cloak plus throwing knife upgrades making missions a walk in the park. Just throw a knife to the head and enemies are instantly dead (even level 10) all from being invisible. Not that it's that hard with Jacob either but at least you have to put some effort in sneaking and positioning.\n\nFinally the final boss fight + ending is super lame. It's like Ubisoft rushed the final 10-15 mins or so of the game. Anyway if you like AC this is still quite an ejoyable run. Definately better then AC Unity, though this one like Unity crashed on me every time I took a stronghold and the custscene would finish. I conquered the strongholds first so after that it ran fine.\n\n","March 21","true","40.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both during the Industrial Revolution and the Present time.\nAwesome visuals with huge architectural and historical buildings.\nNarration was splendid, and humourous.\nMissions were creative, for example, it wasn't always the same old assassination methods. The Unique Assassination worked wonders.\nCharacter were created beautifully. Jacob and Evie had that sibling rivalry most of us can relate to. Which is nice.\nFighting was improved with the double, triple and quadraple kill.\nGangs were okay, with upgrades and all. But I still prefer Brotherhood's "gang". Which are of course Assassins and not some random Roots.\n\nCons:\nMovement still isn't all that smooth, like free running. It's good, but it could be way better.\nFunny NPCs that spawn in places that there were no entrances, (Unless they're freaking Assassins as well)\nWhy do they have Helix Glitches???? Unnecessary items to collect again in the AC franchise.\n\nAll in all, I would still recommend this game! Cheers","January 23","true","36.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was one of the games I was excited about along with Fallout 4, which is also superb. Now when I first started it up there were some framerate issues so I tweaked around wuth the settings, now it's all smooth. The missions are good, and the combat along with the vehicle combat (Go on roof, shoot etc.) is also really good (although I enjoy the vehicle a little bit more, cuz Mad Max) so overall the system is good. Another thing, you have the option to take the game seriously or not, and really, although the missions are fun, and the stealth is really cool, fooling around rammin into people is of course just silly entertainment, so don't be scared to sidetrack and goof around a bit. I like the gang concept along with the upgrades and the skill points, plus I've played Watch_Dogs before, and I also like that game, graphics don't matter to me that much so I don't care about the E3 scale down, I just care about the gameplay. And some of the mechanics such as train surfing and skill points etc. also came into this game, so I'm used to this system, and really it's a nice system. The stealth is (as I mentioned before) good, I like using it, it's comfortable, really.","November 24, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They just jumped in the story not knowing why are they doing what they are doing. Cutscenes are ♥♥♥♥ing everywhere and it takes down playability. It was one of the best things in AC2 and 3 and 4 and even Unity to see what drew them to become assassins and the cutscenes where farely short but held a great message. Really only thing what to do is to do the same missions over and over, collecting small ♥♥♥♥ everywhere and progressing way to complicated. Also the modern day story is just too vague and not that imersive, one of the main things I do miss in AC, some people like it, some dont. I dont like just watching some cutscenes and expect to actually call it a game.\n\nGraphics are nice, Getting good performance at high settings, even though I have a min spec comp. Some issues earlier but it sorted itself out.\n\nGameplay is kinda cool, but knowing actual factual history, women were not even allowed to drink or smoke, not allowed to vote, so how the ♥♥♥♥ are they the hardest enemies? It may sound miso♥♥♥♥ingIdontknow but Ubisoft, dont cater to ♥♥♥♥ing Femfreq or ♥♥♥♥ like that. It takes down on the whole francise and the game isnt developed freely.\n\nOther than that, very repetitive, cool ♥♥♥♥ and good graphics, no microtransactions or buy to win or multiplayer, seems that Ubi actually improved from Unity. I do want to recommend the game, but only to the extent if you do like the series, you do like the game. Idd give it something along the lines of 9 GFX, 7 Story and 6 Gameplay, so around 8/10","November 19, 2015","true","32.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

The only reason it existed is because Ubisoft Montreal got a excellent feedback about Sea battle in AC3 and they found they have no fresh idea anymore so they just improved sea battle and re-released it as AC Black Flag, seriously it should never be considered as a formal AC game because the Assassin orgnization in that game in beyound ignorant. By the way I enjoy sea battle just as much as you do, but they should not add it into AC because assassin is not pirate and Black flag is a total failure.","November 24, 2015","true","29.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Sure you have to solve specific quests with a specific character, but you are allowed to have more control of your favor character.\nI like the new and fresh idea of driving through the town, explore the inside of a building and have a very unique aproach to a quest.\nIt feels much more like an assassin, to have control of your personal playstyle.\nAlso i have to admit that shootings become very strange in here.

Evie looks to take over where her father left off and find the shroud before the templars do.\n\nWhile you play as the two characters you meet historical figures in London such as Karl Marx, Charles Darwin, Charles Dickens, Alexander Graham Bell, and even Queen Victoria. You can go on side quests for these figures, who will reward you with new weapons, money, schematics, and materials. You can also do activities such as fight clubs, cargo hijacking, child labor liberations, strongholds, and templar hunts.\n\nAssassin's Creed Syndicate feels less like Unity and more like a classic Assassin's Creed game. It runs smoothly and renders well. Looks great and feels great.\n\nOnly thing that i would say that i didnt find enjoyable is that the combat can become repetitive at times.\nOverall I would give this an 8.8/10","December 12, 2015","true","46.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game runs smoothly, whith minor bugs here and there, which is essential for any game release. I am running the game on max settings (except PCSS Ultra and HBAO+ Ultra) on a desktop with an Intel i7 CPU, NVIDIA 980 GPU (4GB), and 16GB RAM, with pretty stable 60FPS.\n\nThe main characters in Assassin's Creed Syndicate are fantastic! I absolutely love their personalities, and they are defiantly competitors to the character we all know and love, Ezio Auditore Da Firenze. Jacob and Evie Frye have a houmoristic and great relationship, which makes it fun to watch every cut-scene.\n\nThe gameplay is something different from the other Assassin's Creed games, but I like it. It is nice too see that Ubisoft take chances by changing the gameplay of the series, which makes it more fun for us to play the new game. Ubisoft has taken a step away from the usage of swords in combat, which makes the combat in this game feel fresh and new. They have also added the new "hookshot", which gives the game an even more fresh feeling, bcs it gives you a new way of traveling around.\n\nI could write about this game the whole day, but I think you guys get the point by now.

I would strongly recommend this game. The combat feels good - I can only describe the game as walking around in Thomas Shelby's shoes from Peaky Blinders (on Netflix) mixed with a hint of Spiderman. The hairwork looks a bit lacking, especially compared to The Witcher 3... But other visual aspects of the game look great! I honestly, hate the whole buy it on Steam then activate it through Ubisoft! I didn't realize I had to do that for the DLC as well and sat there wondering why my extra content wasn't working despite Steam telling me that it was installed and paid for!\n\nThere have been plenty of moments of hilarity where I'll be walking down the street and all of a sudden a horse & carriage will randomly start spiraling/spinning/clipping out of control destroying everything and everyone in the streets in a terrifying whirlwind. Those would be the "acceptable" times for the game to bug out in my opinion. In the "unacceptable" times, I've had game quests literally break on me. Forcing me to restart from a check point or even canning the quest and restarting the game. The idea behind having basically two skill trees to play with in Evie and Jacob is nice.. But all in all it is a mute point. Because leveling is extremely easy to do in the game and each tree doesn't have unique enough options in my opinion to even really be of "much" value by the time you hit level 10.\n\nPros:\nGraphics +\nStory +\nAtmosphere +\n\nCons:\nQuest Bugs -\nMovement Bugs -\nSteam/Ubisoft Integration -\n\n\nOverall:\n8/10","January 2","true","30.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/apocaruff/recommended/368500/","apocaruff","Apoca","http://steamcommunity.com/id/apocaruff/","222 products in account","While I do recommend the game, there are a few annoyances. Not the most promising way to begin a review, but oh well.\n\nFirst, I'm not a big fan of the combat system. The Features List boasts a new dynamic fighting system, but to me it felt sluggish and weak. I much prefer the feeling that I got from the combat system in Black Flag. That system felt more intuitive and it looked much better (in my opinion).\n\nSecond, progression felt slow. By itself, that might not be a big issue. However, with the frequency in which "get micro-transactions" is pushed on you, I felt like the progression of gear, items, etc... was purposefully slowed down to encourage the purchasing of these microtransactions for XP boosts, resources, and money. I simply don't like paying for a game, only to be constantly pushed towards spending more money. Especially when the amounts it's asking to spend add up quickly to much more than what the original game cost me.\n\nThird, the Thames feels like a frogger game. Again, by itself that's not too big of an issue. It's fun jumping from boat to boat. It creates an interesting moving landscape to fight and explore on. HOWEVER, when you remember how amazing ships and water were in Black Flag, this system is pretty pale in comparison. Yeah, they're both two different games. But if you played Black Flag and came to this game, it'll feel like you (And Ubi) are taking two steps backwards.\n\nFourth, The carriage system is kind of interesting, but gets boring fast. Once you've tried out the various types of carriage and have done a few of the carriage-based activities, you end up feeling like you've done it all. Which isn't too big a deal, because you've got the completely impossible hook gun thing. You end up feeling more like a gadget-base superhero than an Assassin. But it is fun being able to shoot a zipline between long distances to get around the various smokestacks and other tall structures of London.\n\nAnd that brings me to the Fifth, I didn't feel like an Assassin except for very infrequent instances. The game is still fun, but it doesn't feel like much of an assassin game. More like a "Gangs of New York" game. If you play as Jacob's sister, it feelts a tad more like an AC game, but it's still kind of weak.\n\nSixth, the gang features, despite being a big part of the game, end up becoming repetitive. Once a take control of a territory, that's it. Maybe things change later in the game? But so far, you claim an area and cannot invest, improve, or anything of that sort. After I claimed a couple of territories, I ended up thinking, "What's the point?" and I sort of lost interest in it (and by proxy, the rest of the game).\n\nSo, six 'big' issues with the game. However, I still enjoyed my time. The setting is fantastic, the game looks amazing, and it's still pretty fun. Honestly, if I could go back and tell myself the issues I had with the game, I wouldn't buy it for $60. I'd wait until it's on sale or something. Here's to hoping that the next AC game will be more like Black Flag in terms of features and combat, while also implementing the improvements seen in Syndicate.","December 23, 2015","true","12.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Other than that the cloth physics are atrocius, it's probably just my PC but my cloth physics run at a almost constant 15 FPS, which annoys the Sh*t out of me, but enough about the Negatives, My Positives are that it's the first completely open world/city Victorian game, which I would love to see more games cover this time period, as I think it's really cool. <---(Opinion) Secondly I liked the variety in apparel, I felt it could have had more, but it shows that Ubisoft is taking steps in the right direction.

I love stealth games and play them alot but this is a beat em up at best the stealth here is almost none existant taking out 10 guys at one time. I will admit the start of the game is a challenge but level up abit and by level 3 - 4 you can easly take out a pack of level 10s no problem.\n\nCompaired to past games i have to join crowed in saying while it does hold up against other past titles, it by no means an improvement by an stretch. i switched of almost all hud bar the weapon counter just to make it more challenging.\n\nHow ever i do recommened atleast a one play through just for story sake while its very obvious what is going to happen i love the detail into the characters. Make them fun and amusing. Plus i love the DLC of jack the riper Its what the main game should have been like. all and all id say its a solid game with flaws but if you can look past that you can easily get 15- 40 hours depending if you rush the story or do a few side things.","January 1","true","10.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
