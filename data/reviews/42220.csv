It feels a little bit cliched being like the fourth setting in large castle or mansion like thing (treasure in the royal tower, black moore manor, and castle maloy), but still keeps an origonal tone when outside of the castle. you feel as if the monster could be near you at any moment outside of the castle. Although the German accents were a little cheasy, at most times they were very humerous so it didnt really bother me. the one thing I wish I could change about this game was the story and plot. When compared to many other games to the series, the plot just didn't live up to the great mystery plot twists and creative stories in the other games. I would suggest this game to anyone who enjoys casual games, mysteries or has played previous nancy drew games. I give it a 7/10 but only as a nancy drew fan. coming from the veiw of a more serious gamer or someone who isn't much of a casual game player, 6/10","December 2, 2013","true","14.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It really captured the "Mystery" feel of interviewing suspects, gathering clues, and trying to piece together who-done-it.\n\nI will mention that there was a *lot* of backtracking and re-visiting suspects. And occasionally you had nothing obvious to do, because you needed to be in a specific location to witness a specific event -- so wander around until something happens.  Another negative is that the game has several challenges that aren't properly integrated as Steam achievements -- and no indication of what they are until after you have finished the game.\n\nBut if you are like Nancy Drew, this one is one of the better ones from that series.\n\n\n","December 21, 2014","true","14.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The Captive Curse was good, the only problem I had with it was it had a little too many puzzles. I like puzzles, but not if you have to do one every 2 minutes. Also, it was very long and tiring, with a lot of hopelessly wandering around. Overall I would say a 7/10.

The puzzles in this game were a bit more challenging compared to games like Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake and The Final Scene. It was also really unique to be able to earn money by playing the game Raid -- very interesting how the creators went about it. Also, compared to the classic, the colors are a lot more vibrant and really draw you in. The only thing that I found frustrating was the well puzzle, without a spoiler, you're looking at spending half and hour to a full hour trying to figure this puzzle out. I wouldn't recommend playing this game if you're just starting to refresh your sleuthing skills or if you're new to the Nancy Drew games. The more recent games such as Captive Curse have really stepped up their game with making things more challenging and difficult for players. Other than the well puzzle and possibly getting confused with the passageways, this a pretty interesting mystery game to play.","June 5, 2014","true","5.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I couldn't really get into the plot, and found it rather boring at times.  There wasn't enough going on in the game, and to me there wasn't enough suspense.  The characters were interesting, but a little frustrating to deal with at times.  Also, the game didn't feel like it flowed very well.  It was almost as if they tried too hard with the story.  I would only recommend this game to an experienced Nancy Drew player who has played many of the games before, just so they could add it to their collection.  Otherwise, to me it wasn't really worth it.","January 13, 2014","false","8.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

You also have to talk to people or do things in the exact right order to "trigger" something to happen. Generally had to talk to people way too much (sooo boring!) and had to check over the same areas over and over again to see if I had triggered the right sequence of events to move forward.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Icewolfer93/recommended/42220/","Icewolfer93","sensitivestoic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Icewolfer93/","66 products in account","The Captive Curse is the 24th (of 31 as of December 2014) installment within the Nancy Drew point and click adventure game series. Within this game you assume the role of amaranthine sleuth Nancy Drew and investigate rumors of a mythical monster that has terrorized German grounds, specifically Castle Finster, for as long as many residents can remember. Recently the monster has emerged from the castle woods with a penchant for destruction; causing fires and destroying private property. Markus the castle’s owner has pleaded with Nancy to step in and find out the truth behind the creature before the castle is closed for good.\n\nNancy Drew adventure games are not your typical triple “A” open world RPG or FPS. As the genre mentions it is a “point and click adventure game” where one searches for clues, solves puzzles, questions suspects, and unravels a larger mystery through deductive reasoning. The game is not designed to be an engrossing universe or narrative, but rather for me, is designed as a light-hearted story for anyone of all ages. It serves as a nice break from larger games and is easy to simply kick back to, relax, and enjoy. The plot-line of these games typically takes about 7-12 hours to unravel, depending on your sleuthing skills.\n\nThis game in particular had a great Germanic atmosphere, weaving tales from Grimm’s fairytales and mythical folklore into an intriguing plot. However, its dialogue, scripting, and voice acting falls a little bit flat for me. If this is your first time looking at the Nancy Drew game series, I tend to recommend some of the more classic titles, which are in my opinion, of higher quality and contain better narratives (keep in mind though that their graphics and game engines may be a bit more dated, being from the earlier 2000s). To understand if you might like these games I recommend checking out the more iconic titles: The Curse of Blackmoor Manor, Ghost Dogs of Moon Lake, or Treasure in the Royal Tower. During the summer or holiday sales these games are easily $2-$5 on Steam so just wait until then and you can check out these games as a nice cheap break from the usual. Happy sleuthing.\n","December 27, 2014","true","21.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has the right amount of puzzles, story, and dialogue. It's in a somewhat predictable setting - spooky castle with a dungeon and a creepy forest outside. I'm a bit of wimp when it comes to anything borderline scary so I was a little tense during some moments of the game (mostly the end). It's definitely "scarier" than other games in their series, but that's just my personal opinion, nothing too frightening, of course.\nGraphics are good (made in 2011, Her Interactive's more recent games have improved graphics)  but my main complaint is that the game is not formatted for widescreen.\nOnly major frustration: rearranging f*cking Renate's purse. EVERY SINGLE TIME I would wake her up. The only obnoxious and unneccesarily difficult "puzzle" in the game. 7/10","May 11, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This one was extremely average. Some of the characters were fun, but some of the voice acting was very off. The puzzles were okay.\nThis was one of those games where it's very hard to know what to do next half of the time. In the better Nancy Drew games, the plot flows and you'll have a pretty good idea of what to do next. This was simply not one of the better ones.\nThat being said, I expected it to be much worse than it was. It was decent. The story was fun and like I mentioned earlier, it had some solid characters.\nI just bought this games because I didn't have it, and it was the only cheaper one one Steam that I hadn't played. It satisfied my craving but if you're new to Nancy Drew and want one of the better ones, look elsewhere. I'd personally suggest The Curse of Blackmoore Manor, Shadow at Waters Edge, or Ghost of Thorton Hall.","May 31, 2015","true","22.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only downside here is the lack of a game map/fast travel...it took a it to know where in this castle I needed to go. Hints aren't "too much" either (there are walkthroughs online for anyone who gets stuck).\n\nSlightly lower AV quality than newer games, but the voice acting is great in this episode--you travel to Bavaria!\n\nAll-in-all, for a ND, 8/10","August 29, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought this game was going to be really corny and the characters looked silly, but i was intrugued by the German castle setting and i love point and click puzzle games which are so hard to find! I wasn't expecting much from the game and i was very pleased. Some of the puzzles i ended up looking up clues for online, but found if i would of just tried a little more i would of gotten them. But overall i found them challenging and fun. I liked many aspects of the game, which i think really sold it to me.\n\nA little spoiler here* When i first entered the game my boyfriend(Nancy's) called me on my cell phone and it really put me in Nancy's shoes!  I ended up really growing found of the characters some of the dialoge made me LOL, which is rare for me to laugh :). I loved the setting I really hope I get to see all the characters again especially Lucas! Also many aspects such as using and reusing tools where just really well done.

Captive has a great plot and intriguing characters with enjoyable puzzles that aren't too hard to complete. There's a fantastic setting with oh so many places to explore (I got lost like 10 times in the castle). The only complaint I would have is that it is far too simple to figure out who the culprit is. Other than that, this one was very much enjoyable and it easily ranks among my top three of these games (Deception and Shadow at the waters edge being the other 2)","May 3","true","6.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
