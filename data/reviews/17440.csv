This is quite an expensive expansion with a twenty dollar price tag, on top of you being required to pay the twenty for SPORE™, even though this is not a DLC, but a standalone game.\n\nThis game has a total of 84 new creature parts which is 24 parts more than advertised, 48 new colors, 24 new animations, and 2 new testing area backgrounds.\n\nNew parts:\n12 heads\n12 eyes\n12 arms\n12 legs\n12 hands\n12 feet\n12 details\n\nNew Colors:\n12 completed styles\n36 partial styles (6 in each coat, detail, and base)\n\nNew Actions:\n6 actions in every category\n\nNew test run area backgrounds:\none good\none bad\n\n\nA total of 158 extras, so they each cost about 13 cents. There's nothing added to the main core of this game, just the parts, which add some, but not a lot of extra creating time. BUT, the parts are pretty cool and let you finally build those adorable alien rabbits and killer crocodile flying space creatures you've always wanted to build.\n\nGet this if it’s on sale, you use creator heavily, or if you absolutely just love the SPORE™ franchise.\n\nAnything done in SPORE™ Creepy & Cute Parts Pack will show up in your copy of SPORE™\n\nCurator page:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/6857919/","November 30, 2013","true","65.7"," 118 of 143 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","118","143","4","0"

This one is going to short and simple. This expansion pack for Spore has very unique and interesting new parts and skin designs. Adding more creativity to the game. Sadly, that is all this expansion has to offer, I do think they could of added more. Considering the price, it's a rip off, do not waste $20 on this. Wait for it to go on sale for $10 or lower for a deal worth making.\n\n5.5/10","April 21, 2014","true","73.1"," 57 of 73 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","57","73","0","3"

Now that that's out of the way...\n\nOkay, here's the deal. I love Spore. Like, a LOT. So, when it went on sale a while back, I decided to re-buy it (I owned the disc version, but lost the code, so I basically didn't own it). DLC was only like, $5, and I played Galactic Adventures (I loved it, but that's a review for ANOTHER day). Honestly, it was hardly worth the $5.\n\nSo if you don't know, the Creepy & Cute pack adds some new creature parts and patterns, but that's it. The arms and legs are literally all bug parts, so nothing I want to use there, some cool new other bits, though. For patterns, some feel "Creepy" like one pattern that looks kind of like muscles, and not so much cute (though it does add a feather pattern, sort of, which is awesome because I love building birds in this game). It doesn't really add too many parts, and quite a few of them feel like they should be part of the game already.\n\nThe other problem is that it ONLY adds creature parts. No new clothes, no building, no new anything. Also, the new animations are only in the test drive mode. They're cool to watch, but would be even cooler to see in game. Oh, and another thing that bothers me (But isn't a deal breaker by any means) is the fact that because of how the expansions worked pre-steam, Steam tracks my hours while playing Creepy & Cute, but not the actual game, which means I have to play without my extra parts if I want steam trading cards.\n\nOverall, don't waste $20 on this expansion. If you have $20 burning a hole in your wallet, and you already own Spore, try out Galactic Adventures. It's pretty awesome, if I do say so myself (owned the Expansion for Disc, so yeah. I plan on getting it on a sale or something).\n\nTL;DR: Doesn't really add a whole lot. Not worth $20, though might be worth it if it's on sale.\n\nDon't forget, THIS IS REVIEW OF THE DLC, NOT THE GAME. I love Spore, man!","January 28","false","24.2"," 47 of 58 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","47","58","3","0"

You need the SPORE base content to launch it, but it is counted as it's own game you can launch, and not technically a DLC.\n\nThe SPORE: Creepy & Cute Parts Pack has a bit of extra content that makes the game creepy & cute, and SPORE franchise fans would enjoy the small but unique addition this pack gives to the game. It's not a whole lot, but it's good in it's own right.\n\nI would recommend getting the SPORE: Creepy & Cute Parts Pack on sale when the SPORE games are bundled for a fraction of their regular price. Since the three SPORE games on Steam are so similar to each other, getting the bundled discount when they are on sale is the best way to save your money and get all your money's worth too at the same time.","March 8, 2015","true","1.9"," 26 of 30 people (87%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","87","26","30","3","0"

On another note, for some odd reason, you can launch the game through this, I don't know why you wouldn't just launch it through SPORE.\nAnyway, definately recommended!","June 9, 2014","true","0.1"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","23","28","0","0"

Other than that, the Creepy and Cute Parts Pack (C&C going forward) adds over 100 new parts for your creatures, buildings, and vehicles, including your soaceship in the space stage. Is it worth it, though? Well, if you want more variety than the already vast offerings of the original Spore, than this might be for you. In my opinion though, wait until it goes on sale as a bundle with either Spore and C&C, or if you own the original, wait until the dlc goes on sale. As of writing this, Spore and C&C are on sale as a bundle for $30, and the C&C's normal price is $20. In this case it is not worth it in my opinion, wait on a better sale. Don't get me wrong, Spore and C&C are wicked fun, but all this adds is another level of customization, and as previously stated, there is already an incredible amount built into Spore itself.","July 3, 2014","true","42.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","2"
