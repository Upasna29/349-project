There is a lot of sudoku freeware that does it so much better so why waste your time on this.... oh the 'adventure game' aspect right?\n\nWell that blows even harder than the sudoku part, basically you solve 'mysteries' and do detective 'work' by solving the stupidest and simplest of sudokus and each one you resolve gives you another 'clue'. Nonsensical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and the biggest insult is the game dares to charge you money for this half baked concoction of adventure/puzzle/sudoku 'game'.","July 30, 2014","false","0.2"," 39 of 42 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","39","42","0","2"

I started the story mode on normal difficulty, skipping most of the text to get to the puzzles I want. Most of the time, the grids were only missing 1 or 2 numbers a box which made it seem kind of redundant for a challenge.\n\nAfterwards I decided to go into free Play, and tried to play a "Hard" sudokuball puzzle, I was able to complete it in about 20 minutes which disappointed me being a sudokuball puzzle. Essentially solving one of the 3x3 grids made the rest of the puzzle just fill in the blanks.\n\nAs a detective game, there isn't even any challenge, just solve the sudoku and you pretty much solve the game.\n\n3/10","May 16, 2014","false","1.0"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","0"

And, well, it definitely IS Sudoku stretched out across a globe but that's really all it is and the new viewing angle doesn't serve any purpose but to make it harder to read the board. It doesn't change the game to be anything but a sloppier version of this already well established thing. The abundance of hand holding also becomes rather annoying, as though it's great for those new to Sudoku there's no way to disable it as far as I could find, and it basically becomes this catch all safety net where you can just try combinations until they turn gold and lock in place signally that you got it right.\n\nThere's a story (of course there's a story, why wouldn't there be in a Sudoku game?) but I'm pretty sure I'd have a more enjoyable time reading over the Clue instructions a couple dozen times than listening to these odd, clay-like mannequins reciting tired murder mystery cliches and making banal small talk. When the best part of your game is that one of your character seems to be wearing a wig made of Cheetos then you've pretty much left me at rock bottom trying to cling to anything that's even remotely amusing.\n\nI used to think that it was pretty impossible to screw up a Sudoku game. Sudoku is such a well understood - thing - that there's not really much more for you to do but make the pen and paper logic puzzle digital. But Sudokuball is that first time for everything. It's presentation is unnecessarily tedious to decipher, low resolution, allows no space for writing down potential numbers, and forces you to use some obnoxious Sudoku training wheels. It managed to make me kind of hate Sudoku, a game I've loved for years but in this form left me reaching desperately for my coffee table book or any of the dozens and dozens of better video game adaptions. That's pretty bad any way you slice it.","December 17, 2014","false","1.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","1"

I wanted it to be good, but it's baaaaad.\nOn the surface it's a little like Safecracker or Puzzle Agent in the, you're a detective of sorts, solving sudoku over puzzles to unravel some mystery, shenanigans. However, the comparison stops there.\nThe resolution options are low, medium, high, wide. I mean come on. What century is this?\n\nOk, so I only messed around in story mode for a short while but the story was pretty uninvolving if I'm honest. The controls are a bit dodgy too. I dropped my mouse sense to 800dpi and it was still difficult to get levels and puzzles to lock into place.\nThe final nail is that the puzzles are laughably easy. Maybe it gets harder later on but I soon grew bored of facing yet another grid where there's really only one square to solve.\n\nIt just feels a bit lacking. More could have been done with this.\n\nAnd then it hit me. How can you get a simple click and drag control system so wrong? The only possible explanation is that this game was never designed to use a mouse as an input device. The evidence starts to mount up and now I feel like an actual detective. The resolution options, of course! This game was never built for PC. It was built for a smartphone, that's why the cutscenes use still images and have no voice acting.\n\nIt all becomes clear. This is a half-arsed mobile port and suddenly, the price tag that seemed reasonable starts to feel like a massive ripoff.","May 18, 2014","false","0.8"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

There are few bugs but easy to fix, just go to main menu and replay, so it's fine by me. The main story is like standard detective novel with nothing surprising at all. Do not expect this game for story, just enjoy sodoku puzzle.","July 23, 2014","true","3.9"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

There's few gamemodes within Sudoku in Story mode:\nClue find - Regular Sudoku without time limit, fill the big square with ? marks.\nInspection - Fill the entire Sudokus(9 big squares, 81 tiles) several times Within time limit.\nLockpick - Fill the center tile with correct number(4 wrong number to fail), Within the time limit.\nChase - Fill the tile with red footprint. Taking more time = more tiles to deal with.\n\nThe ball rotation with RMB is hard to control, thus it would frustrate you in timed levels.\nOther than that, control is quite generic for sudokus(number keys and - key work and recommended)\n\nI've been a fan of connected sudokus(those are connected at corners), but in Main Story mode they haven't fully used its goodness.\nIn Classic mode it's used well, and plays better than 4 minigames Story mode offered.\n\n7/10, Get it only if you like Sudokus. If you're detective fan, there are better games around.","May 16, 2014","true","1.6"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"
