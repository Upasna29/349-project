This game really manages to find the sweet spot in terms of difficulty and mechanics. It also feels really modern while staying true to the old school roots of the genre. The controls are super smooth and they really couldn't be more responsive. The graphics are also smooth and nothing ever feels confusing. I really like the simplicity of the art style as well. The soundtrack is awesome and very appropriate. Everything just blends really well with this game and feels refreshing. If I'd have to point out a downside it would be the tutorial which isn't necessarily the best. But the game gives you enough feedback for you to figure out all the details of what's going on. Finally, just check out the feature description, there seems to be something here for all sorts of fans of the genre. It really is glorious to see all this shmup greatness running at 60fps in HD. It would be a sin not to give this one a shot if you're into bullet-hell.","March 18, 2014","true","16.9"," 43 of 45 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","43","45","0","0"

You've seen tons of them at the arcades, the japanese gaming industry pumping out thousands of them, even indie developers like ZUN making ENTIRE SERIES of them. The thing is, that's because they are brutally challenging, aesthetically pleasing, and reward high risk gameplay and daredevil flying, so a lot of skill and high reactions are required. Danmaku Unlimited 2 is perhaps one of the purest examples of such a thing. It's the Bullethell shooter genre distilled into a two-flavoured package.\n\nI say that because DU2 actually has two modes of play. Both are exactly the same game, and the upgrades and progressing you unlock (oh yes there's that too) apply to both modes, but each mode changes the core mechanics of the gameplay.\n\nIt's not immediately obvious from the outset, so here's a rundown. You have Burst mode, and Classic mode to choose from when you start a game. Classic Mode is your average Bullet-hell style shooter. You have a ship that's pretty mobile, it has a tiny little hitbox (that nice glowing core on your ship, don't let bullets touch it!), and you can shoot your guns. Your primary fire (Z, or X on a 360 pad) is your wide area rapid fire shooting, and your secondary fire  (X, or A on 360 pad) is your Focus ability, which most STG fans will know is where your fire goes to a narrow path straight ahead and is concentrated, all point items on screen are sucked towards you, and movement is slowed allowing for more precision movement. This allows you to weave in and out of the beautiful bullet patterns to "Graze" your ship along bullets. Grazing increases your score multiplier and also powers up your "Trance" ability (C, or Right Bumper on 360 pad), which is the same between both modes - a quick wipe of all bullets CURRENTLY on the screen, and your power is massively increased, allowing you to destroy enemies rapidly, also causing them to drop very high value point items... for a limited time of course. Once Trance runs out, it has to recharge. In Classic mode, it automatically recharges over time.\n\nIn BURST mode on the other hand, you still keep your regular primary fire as normal, but your Focus ability is changed to a "Beam" ability. It has all the benefits of the usual Focus mode, EXCEPT that you don't fire again until AFTER you release the button, and ONLY if your Beam gauge is full, sort of like a mini Trance power! The Beam power is STUPIDLY powerful, and wipes out bullets it shoots too, so FANTASTIC for getting out of a tight spot. However you can only actually fire with it if the gauge has enough power in it, and hte more power, the longer it fires for. How do you build up the guage for the beam? You collect point items! Simple yes? Trance is exactly the same in BURST mode, except that in THIS instance you can ONLY build your Trance gauge up if you graze bullets. It does not automatically refill this time. You actively have to put yourself at risk to get it back so you can save yourself in a pinch.\n\nHere's where Danmaku Unlimited 2 really shines. At its core it's pretty bog-standard STG format, with a few little twists (like Burst Mode for example), but it is a game entirely built around risk and reward, ESPECIALLY with the Burst Mode. The closer you are to enemies when you destroy them, the more your multiplier is built up, and the higher value pointitems they drop. The more bullets you graze, the higher your score, the quicker you get back your Trance gauge. The better you do and the further you get, the more 'XP' you get, which grants you more points to spend on upgrades to make your ship ever more powerful.\n\nIt's devilishly hard, and a lot of fun... and that's not even mentioning the ASTOUNDING soundtrack by BLANKFIELD. Give it a listen, it's pulse-pounding, adrenaline-fuelled metal and it is GLORIOUS. It's just a terrible shame it's so pricey at $9.99!.. but then you do get the soundtrack for the previous game in the series, the sadly iPhone only "Storm Strikers". Oh well!\n\n(I think there's a Danmaku Unlimited 1 as well, but that's again iPhone only... and may actually be Storm Strikers, I don't know. I can find VERY little details on both Storm Strikers and Danmaku Unlimited 1!)","October 13, 2014","true","1.5"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","41","43","0","0"

In the course of gaming for nearly three decades, I've played many shmups since Space Invaders on the Atari, but have only begun to truly appreciate them in the last year - better late than never!  With developers like Cave, Treasure, Raizing, Seibu Kaihatsu, and many more - there is an enormous wealth of quality titles to experience and yet, Danmaku Unlimited 2 holds an important position within the genre in my estimation as a relatively "new" player.  While those many other games are awe-inspiring on a number of levels, they are largely geared toward the very practised player and require a level of skill that can be offputting to somebody who is trying to gauge their interest.\n\nDanmaku 2 has the perfect balance of accessibility and ramping difficulty.  The mechanics of the game are very clear, and the hitbox of the player ship is obvious and visible.  The visuals are crisp, clean, and colourful, without creating any visual confusion, and the music is fanastic and sets a great atmosphere.  I feel that Danmaku Unlimited 2 is the perfect "training course" to the greater arena of shmups, and by investing time into this game, my skill level has increased by leaps and bounds in the other games.  Still, it's plenty challenging in its own right, and I've yet to 1-continue complete the game on any skill level above normal.  I find it a sublime rush to play on the hardest difficulty - with the excellent soundtrack blaring on full blast through my headphones, the screen rotated vertically (Tate) and my arcade joystick sat on my desktop, I often experience a feeling while playing DmkU2 that may resemble so-called "battle calm" - a tranquil trance-like state of absolute focus and heightened response where time seems to slow down and greater reflexes allow dodging through seemingly impossible bullet-hell situations.  I can't honestly say I've really experienced anything similar in other gaming genres, and it feels awesome - that's why I find myself becoming avid about shmups!  Danmaku Unlimited 2 is a brilliant game, and it blows me away that it's developed by a one-man development studio - I recommend that you pick it up straight away!","March 18, 2014","true","1.7"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","1"

What it isn't is groundbreaking, or genre defining. What it is, however, is a master class training program into danmaku shoot 'em ups, and it does it so well i challenge anyone to deny they've improved their skills while playing.\n\nYou may have seen games such as Touhou Project, recent Cave titles, or general Japanese Doujin releases and thought "it looks amazing, but i would suck" - this game is for you! DU2 lets you get used to things, before making you work - something a lot of these styles of games lack. I've been playing "Danmaku" games for years and was pleasantly surprised at how configurable this title is, and how much it wants you to get better.\n\nThis game is one of the most configurable Shoot 'Em Up's on the market - it goes from easy peasy, to OMFGWTF just happened in a few clicks - catered to your needs, and all the while throwing bullet patterns at you that you will recognise in other such games. Training ;-)\n\nDanmaku Unlimited 2 makes you a better shmupper by design, so if you are so inclined, you'd be stupid not to play it.\n\nBTW, it has a great soundtrack too!

Veteran danmaku won't have a problem with this,but do buy for the music.\n\nThis game is practically the oasis of a desert of poorly optimized and graphically subpar danmakus on Steam.\n\nThe gameplay doesn't differ from any other Danmakus. But since it's a genre it should not try to be different since there's little room for change. Think of FPS games.\n\nI really liked the leveling system in the game. It's pretty fresh and it gives me a reason to go back and play it. Pardon me as I inflate my ego by stating that I beat the game on extreme on my second try. Which to be honest is a pretty troubling thing for me. Spending money on bullet hell only to play it for an hour and never touch it again because there's no reason to.\nBut do not use this as a basis of your judgement on the difficulty of the game. I have an unhealthily long log of Danmakus that I've beaten on the highest difficulty so I guess I can be considered a veteran.\nThis game isn't hard nor is it too easy. It's perfect for beginners-above average\nYour arsenal contains of the usual projectiles in which you'll hold on to the button the entire time you're playing.\nThen there's the bomb which will convert all incoming enemy project into point orbs.\nThen there's the laser which will destroy any projectile that it can reach.\n\nThe graphics are surprisingly smooth and clean. Seeing as how I was greeted by a small window for settings when I first started the game I immediately had my expectations lowered. People who played a lot of the other Danmaku will know what window I'm talking about. *Looks at eXceed , Acceleration of Suguri etc.*\nDon't get me wrong,those game are fun in their own aspect.\nAlso keep in mind that this is a mobile port... The very thought of playing a bullet hell on a mobile phone terrifies me.\n\nThe soundtrack really took me by surprise. The first stage music started off lightly with a few acoustic fingerstyle strums before pleasantly transitioning into heavy metal. Metal is unjustly underused in bullet hells and I really hope to hear more of it.\n\nSo buy it if you're:\nnew to Danmakus\nfamiliar with Danmakus\nvet of Danmakus\n\nRather,just buy the game if you appreciate a good game with good music.\n\n\n*If you're wondering what's 'Danmaku -弾幕-', its literally barrage.","March 31, 2015","true","16.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","9","9","3","2"

The pattern and level designs play a lot like what you'd expect from a Cave game (medium speed static boss patterns, lots of aimed shots from small enemies, big guys who cancel bullets when dead), though with some slight Touhou influences (bosses divided up into spell-cardish patterns, grazing for score), and some really clever and creative pattern designs that just feel really fun to play on a fundamental level. The stages also feel really expertly crafted with a lot of risk/reward desicions and a great sense of pressure.\n\nThe aesthetics are also quite nice. The graphics look great in motion, and the environments and effects are pretty colorful. The music is also top notch, done by a doujin/indie group called Blankfield/Warinside that do heavy metal arrangements of classic video game tunes. Their stuff is lot heavier than most video game heavy metal, but still very melodic and catchy.\n\nIf you've played any Cave or Touhou styled bullet hell shooters, you probably have an idea of what to expect here, but the execution is really top notch to the point that I'd recommend it over some Cave games.","March 21, 2014","true","2.2"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","2"

I could be mistaken with my points.\n\n- The tutorial is a bit of a joke. Unless of course, it's intentionally sparse, and part of the fun is figuring stuff out.\n\n- Considering how there isn't a focus fire button, and you have to get particularly close to the bullets for the graze to register, grazing is hard as balls in this game. If you're an agressive grazer like I am, it might be a little frustrating.\n\n- The stages feel a little long, the enemies a little too indistinguishable from one another, and wave progression barely identifiable (That's a crap ton of clouds!). The pretty backgrounds don't offer much in the way of landmarks, so it's hard to get a sense of how far into the wave you are at times. And because you don't have that extra bit of information to rely on to remember stage patterns, you gotta either play reactively (which is terrible for serious scoring), or memorize enemy patterns (which is a bit of a chore since the stages can get quite long). The music's pretty good, but in light of how you can't get cues from the music because it doesn't really sync with stage crescendos, which hampers with the gauging of progression as well, it isn't as enjoyable as it could've been.\n\n- The "unlock more power-ups for your ship as you play" mechanic is interesting in theory, introducing a sense of persistence in the game, but good god, do I hate flying a gimped ship that requires grinding to power up. I mean, if the entire arsenal weren't locked behind an arbitrary currency system, and you could gimp your own ship for higher score multipliers, that might've been a more engaging experience.\n\nIt's a pretty game, sounds really good, and has kinda interesting bullet patterns and mechanics, but these were a couple of things that kinda bothered me. There are a few minor technical ｎiggles (Dammit censor, that's an actual word), but nothing terribly major.\n\nBut seriously though, playing through every round in one sitting does feel like a drag.","March 21, 2014","true","2.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Not to mention the bullet patterns are very creative (I especially enjoyed the 3rd boss) and keep you on your toes.\n\nThere were complaints of native 360 pad detection, but I had no such issue.\n\nCoupled with a nice fitting OST, you can't beat $4.99 especially at the 20% discount right now as I type this.\n\nI'd say it's worth at least $8-10.\n\nThis will see more hours from me.","March 18, 2014","true","3.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This Authentic Japanese Doujin Shooter's Qualities will appeal to many gamers"\nIntroduction - My Story  When I saw this game and dashed through its content, I thought it looked quite familiar and when I decided to watch its trailer and after that, I immediately wanted to buy this game. Watching the trailer seemed to spark something lost in my memories I have forgotten. After buying this game and then afterwards playing it, I was never so happy to find other games similar to the ones I had played during my childhood.\nPlaying Danmaku Unlimited 2 has relived my memories from years ago of playing my favorite Arcade Style & Scrolling Shooter series Raiden and other Japanese shmup games.\nNow that you heard my story, why should you buy this game now?\n\nThe Game Changing Elements    Introduction:   For beginners & newcomers this is a great choice for a Bullet-Hell Genre. You can and will rapidly adjust to your game play by the upgrades and difficulty that helps adjust with YOUR OWN GAMING STYLE. There will examples like Side Shooting or even Homing Rockets for you to choose depending on what you may prefer.\nGraphics:   The Graphics of this game are amazingly exploding in 60fps HD quality, being quite appealing to the eye. Along with a Smooth & Beautiful Background that doesn't distract you from enjoying the game and if the Mirror Background does happen to disturb you at all, then you can always disable it in Options. Otherwise, the graphics won't be distracting at all during Gameplay.\nControls:   Your Controls are very Swift and can be changed to your handling. Using only the Arrow Keys for Movement and Z - Primary Fire, X - Secondary Fire or Beam, and C - Trance Mode as default controls.\nDifficulty Mode:   As for the Difficulty Modes, they are very Forgiving and No Hassle to change. I'm a veteran with this genre of gaming, but yet always choose Easy/Medium first to get used to the game first (Same goes to almost any game I play, I'll either start with Easy or Normal. Also, because I want to enjoy the game first), later switching over to "Impossible Difficulty" and had no trouble... With some practice first, of course. At times it can certainly be fun and challenging.\nGame Modes:   There are 2 Different Game Modes being Classic & Burst Mode. The only differences between those 2 modes are your Secondary Fire and Trance Mode; For Classic your Secondary will be fired in a different position from your Primary Fire and appear to home in on your Target/s until you go up the screen at a certain height and the Trance Mode Bar will automatically fill up by itself. In Burst Mode you will have a Beam as your Secondary; The once charged will unleash FURY UPON YOUR ENEMIES and even wipe away any bullets upon its path. However, the Trance Mode Bar in Burst Mode does not fill up automatically.\nBullet Patterns:    Creative Bullet Patterns are something that must be payed attention closely as you play multiple games for your benefit studying them; while some patterns are easy to follow and others require a few glances to understand its nature. The harder the difficulty the more complicated the patterns will turn out. Figuring the patterns out are also key, "To Increasing your score by Glazing Bullets, therefore increasing Multiplier".\nUpgrading System:   Now the Upgrading System, while some games back then offered multiple ships with certain stats changed and different weaponry or items also; Danmaku offers an upgrading system allowing you to adjust what you prefer like Firepower over More Lives. You get more points throughout the game as you play and Rank Up. Upgrades will include 3 Different Weapons, Lives, ADS (Amount of Hits you can take in 1 Life) etc.\nMusic:   The Music by BLANKFIELD is out of this World. I'll admit I have never heard of them before, but very glad I did and without their work this game would have never had such amazing music to ease your game playing. Intense Gameplay & Roaring Music... Without one of them, we would be missing a huge element.\nOh, and it's Only $5 and Really Helps the Developers + BLANKFIELD as thanks for this game.\n\nConclusion  Overall, I really like to thank the developers for creating such an incredible game and for letting me experience my childhood once more :P.\nI would definitely be interested in a sequel to a clearer story as many others aren't sure as I am to what those Allied Fighters' purpose was after they took off with you in the beginning of Stage 1 with you and later on 1 got destroyed during combat? You will not see them again later on in the game after that occurring event.\nI thought that later they might help you out, but I guess they didn't so I would like to know their purpose. Until then that part will remain a mystery to everyone.\nI brought this game for $7.50 (At the time it was still $10, but for 25% off) and I didn't regret one cent, as this was truly a great game that I have enjoyed playing. I also had fun writing this review :)\n-Regis","September 20, 2014","true","5.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/collision22/recommended/280560/","collision22","Bonus!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/collision22/","39 products in account","Given the high praise this game received, particularly as a smart phone game, I was curious to check it out on the PC. Sadly, I fell rather disappointed by this game, and consider it to be severely lacking. Even among independently developed games it can’t measure up.\n\nThe game itself seems okay at first sight. You get a modifiable fighter plane with weapons — straight shot, homing shot, wide shot — that you can mix and match. There are two scoring modes, Burst and Classic, and four difficulties each. Following STG convention, the game has five stages, with mid and end bosses, and if you finish the game on one credit on at least hard’, you’ll face a ‘true last boss’ as well. As a bonus, there is a boss rush mode, and a free play mode for those who like to credit feed through the game.\n\nWhile Danmaku Unlimited 2 follows the STG formula in broad strokes, it sadly goes awry in many, many areas. Let me describe some of the problems I’ve had with it one by one:\n\n1) The music is incredibly bland and does not synchronise with the action on screen at all.\n\n2) There are very few sound effects, not even for basic actions like shooting.\n\n3) The shield system is poorly thought out. If effectively acts as a life bar, meaning that you can take several hits. However, if you slip, you lose the ship. This seems needlessly punishing. As I'll describe later on, there are situations where it's easy to trip up due to design flaws of the game.\n\n4) Bullet visibility is pretty poor. While you can tell bullets from the background, there is not enough contrast. Have you ever wondered why in Cave games the bullets have garish colours, while the backgrounds may even seem a bit washed out? Here, bullets and background are often in similar colors. This problem might have been prevented had there been actual background images instead of mostly static colors.\n\n5) Further, I am not fond at all of how some of the bullets overlap. There are instances where smaller bullets move underneath larger ones, so while you focus on avoiding the larger ones, you may get hit by a small bullet that just emerged underneath it.\n\n6) In many STGs, there is a dead zone around turrets, meaning that if you’re getting close, they won’t fire. In Danmaku Unlimited 2, this is not the case, which means that as you move past a large space ship, you may just get hit without expecting it.\n\n7) What I also find very unfortunate is that smaller enemies don’t get invincibility frames. Particularly in stage 5 it may happen that you get hit because you didn’t memorise yet that you entered a part of the stage where a swarm of small enemies enters from the side. Those deaths through collision punish players who have not yet memorised a stage, and are a sign of poor game design, in my opinion. A good counter example on Steam is Crimzon Clover, by the way, where enemies that fly into the screen can’t hit you for a few frames.\n\n8) Overall, the difficulty is really uneven. Some boss patterns in later levels are laughably easy, just to be followed by much trickier ones. In a carefully balanced STG I expect something different.\n\n9) I strongly dislike that I have to unlock game features. This means that you start out with an underpowered fighter, and have to earn in-game currency (thankfully no IAP), to unlock more lives, continues, or more powerful weapons.\n\n10) There seems to be a bug: When you 1cc the game, you end up at the title screen, but you don’t unlock any achievements, or get any of your in-game currency. However, if you then enter a new mode, and exit prematurely, then the game records your progress.\n\n11) Minor quibble: I would have appreciated if the game let me skip the credits.\n\n12) The high score boards are hacked, which is always unfortunate, as it shows a lack of support of the developer.\n\n13) The scoring system is poorly thought out, since a few successful actions completely negate the entire rest of the game. Some people are upset because in Cave games it is often the case that you score more in stage 5 than in the entire rest of the game, even though stage 5 normally is a lot longer and has a lot more enemies, so it’s pretty much justified. In Danmaku Unlimited 2, though, your score depends on something like a minute or two of play time in total.\n\n*** added ***\n14) The achievements with point values seem broken. I just reached 1 billion in total,  but it didn't activate.\n\n15) Some bullets, like the hexagons, are incredibly poorly designed. Those only harm you if you get hit by the center, meaning that the hitbox of your ship can safely sit on a large part of the area of those bullets. Another example are the large bullets in the last phase of the stage 5 boss. However, those have no demarcated center. Just like with the other bullets, if you don't know this, then you think those boss patterns are a lot more difficult than they are.\n\n16) The transition from iPhone to PC should have led to changes in the control setup. On the phone, the speed of the ship is relative to the speed of your finger. In this version the ship has a relatively high default speed, and to slow it down, you have to use the burst shot. This is fine in Classic mode, since that shot is available without limit. However, in Burst mode, you can only slow down by activating a burst shot with a separate gauge that has to be filled. If the gauge isn't high enough, the ship does nothing at all. This means that some boss fights, where you have to weave though tight patterns, are incredibly tedious, and take a lot longer than they otherwise would.\n\nConsidering all those issues, some minor, some large, I simply cannot recommend Danmaku Unlimited 2. There are other STGs of much higher quality available on Steam, or on consoles. My personal recommendation on Steam is Crimzon Clover: World Ignition, which is also independently produced, and one of if not the best STG around.\n\nI'd recommend this game to people who think that touch screens are a superior input alternative for STGs, those who think that superplayers can dodge rain, and those who consider Touhou to be the pinnacle of this genre. Danmaku Unlimited 2 is not the bullet hell you need, but the one you deserve.\n\n2/10","January 6, 2015","false","7.5"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","56","18","32","4","3"

This is a bullet-hell 2D shooter, the kind where your screen gets flooded by death and you're expected to survive and get a high-score. While lacking in style, DU2 has the fundamentals down pat, is sufficiently challenging, and can be quite entertaining.\n\nI forgot the plot to this game. It was probably too dramatic and complicated for me to understand.\n\nTo start with, DU2 has an upgrade system. It's a little unique in that while you eventually get more points to distribute, you never get enough to max out anything. Your options include increasing your firepower, your ADS (shield), and additional lives & continues. Extra survival sounds nice, but taking damage will severely penalize your score. Unless beating the true boss reveals the best ending since -insert your favorite videogame ending here- I'd consider investing elsewhere. Most of your "upgrades" are going to come the old-fashioned way, playing through the game again and again until you figure it all out.\n\nThere are two modes of play, burst and arcade. I'm going to refrain from speaking too much on the scoring systems. If I understood anything at all I'd have scored trillions of points. If I had to guess, I'd say getting a high-score involves lots of staying close to bullets, knowing when to trigger the hyper ability, and keeping that multiplier high. Burst mode is probably a bit easier to figure out, since you can use a wicked laser to build up the multiplier. Arcade mode is easier though, mainly because holding down the fire button provides a homing shot, allowing you to focus almost entirely on dodging stuff.\n\nHonestly, there's not much else to say. Danmaku Unlimited 2 doesn't really throw any curveballs. Once you understand the basics, it's all a matter of dealing with the increasing intensity of enemy fire. Each of the five stages has the standard mid-boss/boss setup, and the bosses themselves are multi-form behemoths with the occasional gimmick. Like I said, this game doesn't do much to stand out in terms of visuals. This can be considered a good thing however. Not everybody wants to play a shooter, where all of the characters are little girls, and they're fighting an army of giant crocodiles over the world's supply of rice cakes.\n\nDanmaku Unlimited 2 delivers exactly what you'd expect out of a quality 2D shooter. It's probably sitting in your Steam library right now, alone and unloved.

Danmaku Unlimited 2 is a rare experience that offers a very good balanced learning scale which brings you into the easy but still exciting play in the early stages and challenging but passable feel in the later, basically train you in the middle of play, hence it's very good especially for newcomers in this genre.\n\nYou got three different type of weapons: Focus destroys enemy faster but only shoot in a narrower spread so you need to navigate better through all the bullets. Track and Wide are more suitable for newcomer because you can be almost anywhere in the screen to destroy enemy, although both are weaker than Focus. You can gain and use experience to upgrade weaponry, add armory layers, or increase life and continue counts.\n\nWhat makes DU2 really exciting is Burst Mode with its risk rewarding mechanism which encourage you to (1) Destroy everything while flying close to the enemies - it gives you more orbs to charge your laser gauge faster (2) Flying as close as possible with enemy's bullets (which called grazing) which not only increasing your score multiplier but charges Trance Gauge as well. Both laser and trance can be utilized to gives you overwhelming attack which able to clear bullets when it gets activated, valuable tricks to get you out from most tight situations. You need to make use every tricks of these risky mechanisms to the fullest to challenge into the global leaderboard.\n\nThe presentation in HD is beautiful, all the bullet patterns highlighted clearly and the ship/enemy design is very cool, although you may need a vertical screen to enjoy the view in its fullest (I just rotate my monitor lol) and the blood pumping progressive metal soundtrack from BLANKFIELD is amazingly BAD ♥♥♥. Enough said.\n\nOverall DU2 is a very exciting shmup especially with its Burst Mode risk reward mechanism and offers a very good balanced learning scale which is very good for newcomers, really great gameplay experience with a beautiful HD presentation and full adrenaline soundtrack. Very recommended even though you never play Bullet Hell before.\n\nNB: Thanks for (◕‿‿◕) for gifting this awesome game (yes it's his actual username)","January 5, 2015","true","10.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Enough said.\n\nOverall DU2 is a very exciting shmup especially with its Burst Mode risk reward mechanism and offers a very good balanced learning scale which is very good for newcomers, really great gameplay experience with a beautiful HD presentation and full adrenaline soundtrack. Very recommended even though you never play Bullet Hell before.\n\nNB: Thanks for (◕‿‿◕) for gifting this awesome game (yes it's his actual username)","January 5, 2015","true","10.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peachmoon/recommended/280560/","peachmoon","RM щ(ﾟДﾟщ)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peachmoon/","196 products in account","A rock-solid piece of classic shooting action, in a modern package. Anyone who likes the gameplay of a Cave shooter or one of the many main-series Touhou games will feel right at home here.\n\nGameplay comes in two flavors, the Classic style with regular and focused shooting modes, and the Burst style with a bullet destroying laser in place of focused shooting. There is no slow movement mode so the player must be extra careful while manuvering through the many concentrated bullet curtains.\n\nThe scoring system goes unexplained in the game's built-in tutorial, so I'll give a brief overview. Classic style has point items and multiplier items drop from defeated enemies that must then be collected before they fall off the screen, with them being collected when they touch the large circle surrounding your ship. The Burst style has automatic pickup of all items dropped, but requires the usage of the laser weapon to obtain multipliers, with enemies only dropping them when destroyed by the laser weapon. The Burst style also quadruples your multiplier while the player has activated DU2's Trance Mode, which while available in both styles and upgrades all dropped point items to the highest level, only has the quadrupling boost in the Burst style.\n\nThe game features a ranking system, where by playing the game and levelling up you are awarded points to distribute amongst your ships weapons, shields, extra lives, and available continues. The only complaint I have about this system is that you cannot reduce available continues to Zero, slowing down the ability to restart the game for the one credit clear (1cc) fanatic.\n\nDifficulty wise, the game starts out easy and gradually getting harder as you go along, but with an extreme jump between the 4th and 5th stages. I personally found the 5th stage boss to be incredibly easy in comparison to its stage, but I imagine that the developers saved the difficulty for the true final boss that I am unable to even face at present due to being bad.\n\nOverall, I reccommend this game to anyone who enjoys shmup gameplay. Storywise the game has almost nothing going for it, with the remnants of a planned story remaining in the game just to add some spice to the game's opening act.\n\n[Cleared Burst Mode on Normal using continues to complete final level, Cleared Classic Mode on Easy without using continues]","March 23, 2014","true","7.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Yes !\n\nDanmaku mean "Rain of bullets" in Japanese (or something like that), it's a "new" kind of Shoot 'm Up. You're very powerful generaly, and fast. But you've to deal with bullets, a lot of bullets, OMG bullets EVERYWHERE !\n\nThe game isn't easy (good point), musics are delicious and goes very well with the action (very good). Graphics aren't very beautiful, but clear and I like the color pallet (good point as well).\n\nYou can choose two game modes (burst and classic), you can buy some upgrades for your ship or lives/credit. I don't like that much upgrades in Shmups, IMHO those kind of games may be played with only 1 credit and without starting with bonus : the game will be more more more fun :-) But I can ignore this step, so watever.\n\nBurst mode bring a beam (button 2) and the Trance mode (button 3). When activated the beam can "broke" bullets, you're safe using this. The Trance mode make you powerful.\nClassic mode bring an alternate shoot (button 2) and The Trance mode as well (button 3). No beam in Classic mode, but the Trance is better : more powerful and safe (small bullets disapear when activated).\nI personnaly choose the Classic mode.

The controls are super tight, allowing for pin-point movements of your ship between waves upon waves of bullets. The hitbox of your ship is obvious and phantom hits are very very rare. Bullet curtains from mini bosses and bosses are obvious (and on some occasions very beautiful), however navigating the plethora of neon projectiles will take multiple attempts.\n\nThere aren’t any gimmicks with the gameplay, simply shoot enemies and avoid bullets. You’re super weapon charges over time or after an enemy kill. When it reaches 100% you can unleash a devastating beam of energy that temporarily removes all projectiles and deals massive damage to enemies in it’s path. You get a multiplier to your score based on how many bullets “near-miss” you, that is come within centimeters of your ship without hitting you. You also get bonus points for how close you are to an enemy when you destroy them. For those going on a high score run, it pays to live dangerously.\n\nBosses are another area in which this game shines. Bullet patterns the bosses force you to dive through are spectacular and very beautiful. Each boss requires a few playthroughs to understand their attack patterns through each phase. As you advance through the game the number of phases a boss increases, making a untimely bullet hit or ship loss even more costly.\n\nThe icing on the cake is the price point. $4.99 on Steam or from the developers own site is all you have to pay for this excellent game. This game is perfect for beginners (you can reduce the difficulty to beginner levels) or veterans (you can increase the difficulty to rage-inducing levels). No matter your bullet hell playing level, you will enjoy this game.\n\nSee more of the review at: http://www.skepticalminotaurgames.com/danmaku-unlimited-21","October 7, 2014","true","2.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I play shmups every day, it's my main genre, and Danmaku Unlimited 2 is really worth it.  The developer definitely understands what makes a shmup fun to play.\n\nSome good items:\n\n1) The game mechanics and scoring system is explained in a tutorial.  No need to scrounge shmup forums just to learn how to score correctly.  It's also pretty open ended in execution, leaving lots of room for experimentation and pushing you luck for a little more juice.\n\n2) Bullets have great color contrast and stand out well from the background.  Coupled with some interesting bullet patterns, it's makes navigating attacks satisfying and fun.  Oh, and Hibachi dishwasher on level 4! (for those who are familiar with it)  :D\n\n3) The difficulty selection makes a noticeable difference.  For those who want an easy mode, yeah it's here.  Or crank it up for some balls to the wall challenge.\n\nSome things I'd like to see in updates:\n\n1) Unlike the shot buttons, movement keys aren't configurable.  I need to run a 3rd party app just to trick the game into accepting the configuration I want to use.  This is a common problem with doujin shmups so I'm mostly used to it by now, however an in-game config would be handy.\n\n2) Arcade mode isn't a true arcade mode, as you can still carry over extra shop purchases to the next game.  A real arcade mode that starts the player over completely from scratch every game, with level design balanced around that constraint and a separated score list, would be a nice addition.","March 20, 2014","true","17.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has incredibly responsive controls, a rockin' soundtrack, patterns that are very hard to learn, and an absolutely fascinating combo system. You either get up close and personal to the baddies, risking death for a larger multiplier, or you stay back and earn a wimpy-dimpy high score. The Burst mode is another twist, where getting close to enemies now gives you meter for a giant laser beam. Said laser will proceed to wipe out almost every bullet it hits, and give you a multiplier based on that.\n\nDU2 is also abound with customization. You got the standard wideshot, focused shot, and tracking shot for your ship, and you can spend points to upgrade their effectiveness. The way you level everything up is nice as well. As you progress through the game (and inevitably die), you'll rank up and that gives you points. These points can be spent on the three addons, giving your ship more hitpoints, more lives, and continues. Points are never lost, only spent, and can be retracted to spend on different parts. At the rank of Major, I prefer having full life points and as many lives as I can. DU2 allows for intense customization options, and lets you personalize your playstyle to a great degree.\n\nI'd say this is the best $5 I've spent on a game in a very long while, and is well worth it.\n\nUpdate : Finished the game.\ni hate this game so hard, but it's so good.","April 15, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Some other games like Ikaruga and Luftrausers have thrown some unique modern twist on the genre and come out the other end for the better. But as far as traditional, no-frills attached, pure shmups go we haven’t been too lucky and Danmaku definitely comes out sitting atop those that have tried.\n\nIt is exactly what it appears to be, a bullet hell in the vein of the genres heyday like DonPachi and Blue Wish Resurrection (in fact, you might think you’re playing the latter at first). What separates it from many of the manic shooters that have appeared on Steam is that it is largely pattern recognition. Some might disagree but for me this is what makes a bullet hell enjoyable, complicated but recognizable patterns that after spending enough time with the game you begin to memorize until you can run through the whole thing easily enough, and jump to the next level of difficulty. Repeating the process.  Though the game still requires twitch reflexes at times (and let’s face it sometimes luck as well, unless you’re a bullet hell god) I rarely if ever found myself getting hit and feeling like it was the game being impossible. I always felt like if I did get hit it was completely my fault for parsing the pattern wrong or simply reacting slowly, and that’s what makes a game like this fun.\n\nThe game also sports a really solid difficulty curve. Rather than starting and staying hard/easy, or suddenly jumping there is instead a clear and obvious progression. With the first level being manageable for anyone with at least a passing interest in the genre, working its way slowly up to the final confrontation that lives up to the “bullet curtain” term.\n\nFrom a gameplay systems standpoint it’s pretty standard fare. The combo system works as games in the past have combining grazing bullets and simply racking up combos. One distinct difference is the game is engineered to make you WANT to use your “bomb” instead of saving them. Not a bomb in the traditional sense and instead a supercharge (that recharges as you fire/pass time depending on mode) to your weapons that neutralizes the currently on-screen projectiles and grants a brief boost to your combo multiplier. There is also a system of “ranking up” where you can then put gained points into increasing weapon damage, continues, etc, but anyone who spends more than an hour or two with the game will quickly reach the max rank so it’s quite unimportant. Though it certainly helps you get familiar with the game by making the early levels much easier.\n\nIt has an attractive if generic sci-fi, top-down shooter aesthetic and perhaps more importantly conquers another shmup hurdle with the bullets being clearly defined. With a few exceptions the bullets are a contrasting color to the backgrounds meaning you almost never get hit with a rogue shot that your peripheral vision didn’t see meshing with the other on screen colors. It also has some fantastic music that while not my favorite soundtrack in the genre definitely gets you in that “zone” such games strive to achieve and mixes well with the associated encounters.\n\nLong story short I think anyone who enjoys classic shmups needs to pick Danmaku Unlimited 2 up. It’s probably the first in the genre to come to Steam that I can see myself putting significant time into, trying to master it, instead of just being a passing interest.","March 30, 2014","true","10.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, every hit reduces your shield a notch (this can be upgraded), so you tend to see the ADS as an extension of your "lives," and you lose your score multiplier only when you actually lose a life. (So you lose your multiplier on the 3rd or 4th times you get hit, which is sort of silly.)\n\nThe RPG system, where you gain power the more you grind at it, is also something I think is poor; it's a shmup, you should have access to more-or-less everything from the start.\n\nThat said, the soundtrack is rather nice, and the bullet patterns are pretty good. The thing that keeps me from wanting to recommend this is that there are free flash games which provide a similar feel and experience, which are almost as polished as this game.

It's a shoot-em-up (shmup) with an sleek, modern visual style, and a great soundtrack.  Bullet patterns have a good variety and feel fun.  The bullets are easy to see against the background.  The many slow-to-medium-speed bullets  create patterns which look harder to weave through than they actuallly are, which makes them look (and feel) great.  The enemy designs and color scheme are a little monotonous (there's a lot of metallic gray in this game).

What DU2 makes up for however, is an upgrade system very akin to Beat Hazard, in that the more you play, and the better you score, the higher a rank you will achieve, and the more points you will have to upgrade various elements of your ship.\n\nMy only complaint however is to do with the audio -  a minor issue.\n\nI feel the heavy guitar fits the setting of the music, but I feel like it's too much, and can become bland, or jarring to a degree - a little melody here any there could have really made this soundtrack more memorable. Secondly, the SFX seem slightly lacking, I've yet to tweak the audio settings, but at default, it's as if your ship has no firing SFX, putting more focus onto the BGM which doesn't particularly help, and could possibly break immersion.\n\nOther than that, you get a very good experience for your money, the game feels, and DEFINITELY looks the part, so I see no reason why I shouldn't recommend this to anyone.","July 3, 2014","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You usually don't hear music this good in a shmup.  It's easily my favorite OST at the moment.  I can't overemphasize how many points that's worth, in a genre centered around visceral appeal combined with a little brain overload.  The music is important, and DU2's music gets you pumped as heck.\n\nThat said, I have mixed feelings about the actual shmuppery.  Don't get me wrong, I recommend it, because it's fun.  The scoring is simple to wrap your head around, the game itself is relatively straightforward and the patterns are nice, etc.  The bullets are chunky and bright and easy to read, in nice colors.  But the game uses a leveling system that ends up being pointless after you play for a few hours and hit max level.  It just becomes an extra screen to mash through after each playthrough.  And they don't give you enough points to max out more than one shot type, or to have more than one level in each if you want all of them.  So, why even have you level up?  Why not do different ship types?  The shield system also feels pretty noobish.\n\nAll that said, though, the game is still a lot of fun to play, and the stages and bosses have some patterns that are really fun to dodge.  The game also gets ridiculously difficult on higher settings, so there's some longevity to it.","July 5, 2014","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The genre had a long life from the earliest days of arcades, to the golden age of the mid-ninties, and to its relative dawn in the late-nineties to early 2000s. Many classics have left their mark, and many would also say that virtually all innovation has been squeezed out of the genre. Only a few pockets of the faithful, and in rare cases a handful of new converts, remain. One of them, myself.\n\nDanmaku (弾幕, literally bullet curtain or curtain fire) is a Japanese term for "barrage". A sub-genre of shmups, designed for those not faint of heart. Certainly one of the most inhospitable and unwelcoming videogame genres, apart from its already niche appeal.\n\nBut along comes Danmaku Unlimited 2, and revitalizes my long lost love. Never would I actually have foreseen that I would call a Danmaku "accomodating", but that's what this is. It's a tiny, elegant shmup, that allows for plenty of trial runs and a simple, persistent RPG customization that can be outfitted for offense or survivability. All of this is wrapped-up in great minimalist visual design and absolutely bangin' soundtrack. Seriously, I bought the soundtrack.\n\nBe forewarned, this is still not a game that anybody not familiar with the genre can just waltz right into. Sure, you can start with this, and it's a very good one. I can't imagine anyone interested in trying the genre, today, who wouldn't be starting in the deep-end, regardless of which game they start. But it may be harder to see what's so nicely done in Danmaku Unlimited 2 without a pre-existing appreciation.","July 11, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

YES!\n\n-=TL;DR=-\nDanmaku Unlimited is an extremely well crafted vertical shooter that nails controls, difficulty, bullet patterns, graphics and sound design. While a bit difficult due to its bullet hell nature, the game is argurably (and often noted as) accessible to the non-danmaku player - the kind of person that would play shmups ocassionally, but generally not these types. The presentation of DU2 is of top-notch quality, most especially the soundtrack and sound design, and video options even include screen rotation, though, not my 2560x1080 resolution.  Danmaku Unlimited 2 is a pefect buy for shmup/danmaku fans, and a solid introdution for the non-fans, especially at a low price. I knew immediately within the first minute of gameplay that this game was excellent.\n\n\n-=Gameplay=\nFirst off, the options screen provides options to change prize drop visibility, trance mode (super attack) sound cues, screen rotation, most notably the ability to change from X-Input (Xbox 360) or D-Input (DirectInput, the standard of controllers before X-Input), as well as the sound/music options seen in most games (why the hell you'd turn that down is a matter of sin). I've read that the game doesn't support arcade sticks, which is insane, but I would think a X-Input or D-Input stick would work, at least with something like JoyToKey\n\nMain game modes are Arcade and Bonus. Arcade makes the player ship move in a consisten speedt and provides a beam weapon that can cancel bullets and is refilled either by time orbs (I can't tell). The player has a choice of chosing a Focus (Straight) shot, a partial straight and homing shot, and a spread shot. Classic plays more like Exceed 3rd, where the ship moves quickly in its standard shot, and moves slowly to help you carefully dodge and shoots semi-homing bullets in a narrow line, which causes more damage. The Bonus mode offers a Boss Rush and a Free Play mode where you can choose to practice on any level. While most shmups's replayability comes from practice and and doing One Credit Clears (callled 1CC, beating a game w/o continues), the replayability comes in the form of a level up system, which gives you points to improve your weapon type, beam weapon (ADS), Burst attack, lives, and continues after winning or loosing the game. Points for levels are granted regardless if you win, so you are not at a complete disadvantage if you loose, though, most Shmup players will be fine with the standard weaponry.\n\nThe hitbox is clear and quite forgiving as I've had the edge of bullets actually touch the box itself and the bullets are drawn, colored, animated, and used perfectly to give a player an idea of where the bullet is going and where you need to dodge. This is important, as grazing bullets on your sprite is handy in scoring multipliers and points. The bullets are flashy, but not distractedly so, and as long as you focus on the pattern and your location, you should do well. More bonuses are rewarded when you kill enemies with in the circle around your ship which is the point blank range, the same area points are absorbed into when the fall down the screen.\n\nUnless there is some missing/idle cutscene I skipped, there's no story here, and that's how I like it.\n\n-=Presentation=-\nI'm a sucker for cyberpunk/spacepunk/sci-fi-punk style games, so I automatically love the sharp vector look mixed with soft lighting effects. and bright, but non-offensive blue, pink, and green hues. The appearance may be rough for epilieptics, and maybe a little overwhelming if you not used to this genre, but I feel there is a certain crispness and color selection of the bullets that is just right. Though, the game doesn't reach my high native resolution, so the graphics look a bit off compared to what I think it should look like.\n\nThe sound design is perfect. The instrumental techno-metal soundtrack is very similar to Exceed the 3rd: JPBP which is exactly the type of music needed to get you pumped and ready for the bullet chaos. It is exactly my style of music, and I bought the digital soundtrack of CDBaby (can be found on iTunes as well). There's not too much noise beyond explosisions of ships, some bullets/patterns, the perfectly low "click" from grazing bullets, the "ping" from collecting points and you don't have to deal with dialogue or annoying chatter - if you're not a fan of shmup dialogue or the Japanese schoolgirl chatter common to these games, you don't have to deal with it.\n\n-=Conclusion=-\nEverything about DU2 is solid and of great quality. The Steam reviews are 100% postive according to Enhanced Steam. The game is a must-buy for shmup/danmaku fans. I really want to see non-bullet hell fans give this game a shot on easy or normal difficulties - they need to feel how and why shmup fans like myself are so into these type of games.","June 29, 2014","true","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I believe the developer worked soley on iPhone games before this one and you can definitely tell.  I found it difficult to navigate around the playing field at times and felt claustrophobic on more than a few occasions.  This is a shame, because it's not how you should feel when you're playing a shmup - the bullet patterns should make you feel like you're threading the needle down a narrow canyon, not like you're trapped inside an elevator.  Adding to this complaint, the ship speed felt slow to me.  You couldn't zip around and avoid bullets if you needed to, and then slow down using a focus-fire mechanic, there seemed to be no change in speed of your ship when you switched to focus.\n\nI started playing the game on "Normal" difficulty and felt challenged.  This is a good thing - when I say challenged I mean to say it was really difficult.  There were two difficulty levels above "Normal" and I was pumped to check them out.  After beating the main game I jumped right into "Extreme" (hardest) difficulty expecting to get my socks blown off...unfortunately, that didn't happen.  Extreme was nearly the same difficulty as Normal was, just with a few added bullets here and there, but the patterns were largely the same, and if you had figured them out on Normal, adjusting to Extreme wasn't that much bigger of a deal.\n\nUpgrade mechanics - this I didn't like.  The game has an "Upgrade" mechanic in it.  Basically it seems you're supposed to grind the game out quite a bit before your ship is fighting at its full potential.  I think that's stupid.  There's no reason I should have to throw myself at enemies with an underleveled ship numerous times and die in the process before I can have all my unlocks earned.  That's not to say this mechanic *can't* work - it's just that DU2 doesn't fit this style of gameplay.  Example - one of my favorite shmups of all time is Tyrian, it has an upgrade mechanic and it works beautifully as you can upgrade in-between levels and there are numerous paths and levels you can go down.  DU2 is one path, five levels, and you're supposed to grind those same levels out for awhile until your ship's weapons are upgraded and you have all your lives and all your continues available.  No thanks, all or nothing please, this half-way attempt was detrimental to the player's experience.\n\nThe music was good, although I did wish there was more of it.  Each level had a song and there was a "boss" song that repeated at every boss fight except for the final boss.  It was good and unique for a shmup - metal, sounded kind of like Animals as Leaders or Between the Buried and Me or something.\n\nThere are two gameplay modes - Normal and Classic.  Normal is the developers take on a scoring system I guess, but I didn't really like it and stuck to classic mode.  The only difference that I really saw was that instead of a "Focus Fire" mode you had to charge up a beam cannon that lasted only a limited time as well.\n\nOverall I like what the developer was going for here but the above mistakes prevented the game from being a standout (especially the sprite-sizing and claustrophobic feeling).  That's not to say I wouldn't recommend it, I do, but I would only recommend it for fans of the genre.  There are better titles to play (especially for new players) and I would recommend starting there before grabbing DU2.\n\nWith all that said, DU2 is a fine addition to a shmup fan's catalogue and I'm sure you'll have some fun going through the game a few times.","August 27, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are better titles to play (especially for new players) and I would recommend starting there before grabbing DU2.\n\nWith all that said, DU2 is a fine addition to a shmup fan's catalogue and I'm sure you'll have some fun going through the game a few times.","August 27, 2014","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great visuals, great music, patterns and stages are really fun, not to mention how nice it is to be able to customize your ship's shots/lives/continues.\nOnly drawback for me is that the ship is quite slow with no way of modifying its speed, and some bullet patterns on higher difficulties are clearly designed to be dodged with the very swift movements that you can make on a touchscreen. Nothing game breaking, but because of this limitation you sometimes find yourself in quite a bind if you aren't careful and prepared.","August 21, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The genre had a long life from the earliest days of arcades, to the golden age of the mid-ninties, and to its relative dawn in the late-nineties to early 2000s. Many classics have left their mark, and many would also say that virtually all innovation has been squeezed out of the genre. Only a few pockets of the faithful, and in rare cases a handful of new converts, remain. One of them, myself.\n\nDanmaku (弾幕, literally bullet curtain or curtain fire) is a Japanese term for "barrage". A sub-genre of shmups, designed for those not faint of heart. Certainly one of the most inhospitable and unwelcoming videogame genres, apart from its already niche appeal.\n\nBut along comes Danmaku Unlimited 2, and revitalizes my long lost love. Never would I actually have foreseen that I would call a Danmaku "accomodating", but that's what this is. It's a tiny, elegant shmup, that allows for plenty of trial runs and a simple, persistent RPG customization that can be outfitted for offense or survivability. All of this is wrapped-up in great minimalist visual design and absolutely bangin' soundtrack. Seriously, I bought the soundtrack.\n\nBe forewarned, this is still not a game that anybody not familiar with the genre can just waltz right into. Sure, you can start with this, and it's a very good one. I can't imagine anyone interested in trying the genre, today, who wouldn't be starting in the deep-end, regardless of which game they start. But it may be harder to see what's so nicely done in Danmaku Unlimited 2 without a pre-existing appreciation.","July 11, 2014","true","3.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The many slow-to-medium-speed bullets  create patterns which look harder to weave through than they actuallly are, which makes them look (and feel) great.  The enemy designs and color scheme are a little monotonous (there's a lot of metallic gray in this game).

Patterns feel intelligent, and although beautiful you probably won't get much time to admire them! It's exactly as fast-paced as you want, and each difficulty feels notably more challenging.\n\nAs someone who is somewhat challenged, the upgrades really make life easier.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GracedbyAutumn/recommended/280560/","GracedbyAutumn","Graced by Autumn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GracedbyAutumn/","800 products in account","There’s something to be said about the doujin shmup scene, especially when it comes to accessibility and difficulty curves. Indeed, the sheer size of the challenge laid out before would-be bullet hell players often proves itself to be the greatest obstacle that separates those who develop a fondness for games of the genre and those who don’t. While the sub-genre has always possessed a high entry-barrier that no doubt contributed to its limited appeal outside of Japan in the past, those games that hail from the doujin variety tend to stand out in particular. With Danmaku Unlimited 2 Doragon Entertainment seeks to recreate that iconic doujin experience. For the most part, they succeed.\n\nIf Danmaku Unlimited 2 has an in-depth story, it isn’t presented in the game. Like most shmups, Danmaku Unlimited 2 puts narrative to one side and gives its full, undivided attention to the gameplay experience alone. While each of the game’s five stages provides some degree of context for the action, it’s clearly the case that this isn’t a story-driven game.\n\nThe driving force behind Danmaku Unlimited 2 stems from its well-polished, highly-refined core gameplay. A typical scenario begins with the player gunning down countless enemies as they appear at the top of the screen, all the while avoiding the beautiful but deadly hail of bullets sent the player’s way. Defeating enemies causes scoring items to appear and fall towards the bottom of the screen. The final phase of each level is indicated by a boss, who throws a series of different bullet patterns at the player in sequence, switching to the next pattern each time the player inflicts a certain amount of damage upon the boss. Dealing with such heavy densities of enemy fire can prove troublesome, but that’s where ‘Trance’ comes in. Destroying one’s opponents charges the Trance Gauge. When the gauge is full, Trance can be activated, converting bullets in the player’s immediate vicinity into scoring items and also enabling the player to unleash more powerful attacks than before.\n\nThe enemy placement within each level has been well-thought through. Weaker enemies are often clumped together, prompting the player to mow them down in quick succession to boost their score, while stronger enemies like to hide at the top of the screen, peppering the player with bullets and forcing them to take evasive action. However the bullet count consistently remains quite low, particularly for a game seeking to emulate a doujin shmup. It isn’t made any more challenging by the fact that the bullets also tend to move rather slowly. Those two factors lead to the game feeling somewhat easier than what one might initially expect, which could be a good or bad thing, depending on one’s past experience with bullet hell games. Players who are no strangers to the conventions of the genre are more than likely to find themselves underwhelmed even on higher difficulties, which is a shame, considering that those are the people most likely to possess the strongest appreciation for the doujin shmup.\n\nBefore setting off to battle; either from the start of the game or from any stage of the player’s choosing via ‘Free Play’; one may choose from one of two modes. ‘Burst Mode’ provides the player with a potent beam attack which can be used for going on the offensive, or for clearing a path through enemy bullets. The advantages afforded to the player by having such a tool at their disposal are offset by their inability to generate scoring items by killing enemies through the use of normal fire: accurate, efficient use of the beam attack and Trance become the only means of guaranteeing a high score. ‘Classic Mode’ offers up more a traditional bullet hell experience that those already acquainted with the genre should feel right at home with, in which attacks of any sort are adequate for creating scoring items.\n\nThe beam attack and Trance are both well-conceived mechanics. They can double up as additional defensive measures for those getting to grips with the action, while also serving as means for securing additional points, for individuals already on top of things.\n\nPlayers operate the Senko fighter, a versatile craft capable of undergoing numerous upgrades to suit the situation as necessary. Playing the game in any mode earns the player experience. Accumulating experience will gradually allow the player to progress in rank until they hit the top and become an Ace. As rank increases so too do the player’s options to outfit the Senko with the capabilities of their choosing. Players can opt for three different forms of attack for their fighter, in addition to the beam attack. It’s possible to take multiple forms of attack for the sake of versatility, or to focus on upgrading one in order to support a specific playstyle. Those willing to forego the luxury of having extra lives and credits at their disposal will find themselves able to maximize their offensive capabilities. This upgrade system gives players a chance to experiment and find a playstyle that works for them, while also lending the game additional replayability. It’s a nice touch, and one that feels original but still has its place in a bullet hell game.\n\nDanmaku Unlimited 2 is a visually stunning 2D piece – the graphics are easily some of the best seen in a bullet hell game in recent times. The cyan/purple colour palette gives the game’s environments an ‘otherworldly’ look, but not one that feels too far-fetched. Ships have a bold, coloured outline that makes them stand out, even when the screen is literally filled with explosions and scoring items. The centralized HUD also makes a difference: it’s nice not having to take yours eyes too far from the action to glance at some game-critical info. A cyan-coloured dot marks the player ship’s hitbox, which still remains easy to spot in the midst of a heated battle, thanks to the trail it gives off. Unfortunately the same can’t be said about the game’s audio. Most; if not all; of the music quickly gets repetitive. The sound effects themselves are surprisingly weak, and don’t have any real impact, with some explosions being barely even audible even at higher volume levels.\n\nOverall Danmaku Unlimited 2 is a fairly enjoyable game that’s likely to find the most favour with those caught in the middle-ground. Long-time veterans of the genre might find the experience a little too light, but for the uninitiated and anyone with only a moderate degree of bullet hell experience, Doragon Entertainment’s love letter to fans of the doujin shmup delivers an entertaining package that; generally speaking; knows and understands at least part of its audience.","February 1, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

No worries, and No dissapointment there.\nSoundtrack is by the group BLANKFIELD, who also did a bunch of Touhou cover songs.\nCheck them out on youtube. They're good.\n\nGameplay and Graphics? Nailed it. Smooth, and beautiful.\nNot overwhelming to watch, although still difficult, "Lunatic"/Extreme mode isn't impossible. Dodging and Grazing are pretty easy to do... but not so easy you can get cocky.\n-note: I haven't conquered this game yet, so I might eat my words while swearing at the end boss.\n\nI liked how it kept the classic controls of direction keys, z for fire x for focus/slow, and c for "trance" (or bomb on other games).\n\nConfig options allow for different screen resolutions, windowed, etc.\nI was rather impressed by that. Unlike "Exceed: Gun Bullet Children", this game didn't need any modding or file editing to work. So, fret not... should fire up and run like a dream on install.\nOr at least it did for me.\nand for a Steam game to work without having to troubleshoot issues... is a miracle.\n\nHas controller support!

That's about the only con I can find to this game is it lacks a story and dialogue and characters.

After experiencing bad luck on the shmup front, Danmaku Unlimited 2 reminded me why I dig the genre.\n\nThe controls are tight, the music is fantastic, and the visuals are adequate without being distracting or of a low quality. I wasn't able to activate surround sound, despite the options seemingly giving me a choice, and I would've liked to see icons for the 360 controller, but those are nitpicks.\n\nBasically, if you dig shooters, give this a spin. With multiple modes and difficulty levels, I think I'll be spending a lot of time with Danmaku Unlimited 2.\n\nNote: I played for around 30 minutes and made it to level 3. In other words, it's fun for short blasts and probably great for marathon sessions as well. Also, I wanted to add this if you were wondering why Steam shows I played 0 hours.","December 2, 2015","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I kinda wish this game had a 2 player mode with support for local play (playing together on the same PC via keyboard, so both fighters are controlled by the same keyboard), and enough pilot levels so you can max out all your stats.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GracedbyAutumn/recommended/280560/","GracedbyAutumn","Graced by Autumn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GracedbyAutumn/","800 products in account","There’s something to be said about the doujin shmup scene, especially when it comes to accessibility and difficulty curves. Indeed, the sheer size of the challenge laid out before would-be bullet hell players often proves itself to be the greatest obstacle that separates those who develop a fondness for games of the genre and those who don’t. While the sub-genre has always possessed a high entry-barrier that no doubt contributed to its limited appeal outside of Japan in the past, those games that hail from the doujin variety tend to stand out in particular. With Danmaku Unlimited 2 Doragon Entertainment seeks to recreate that iconic doujin experience. For the most part, they succeed.\n\nIf Danmaku Unlimited 2 has an in-depth story, it isn’t presented in the game. Like most shmups, Danmaku Unlimited 2 puts narrative to one side and gives its full, undivided attention to the gameplay experience alone. While each of the game’s five stages provides some degree of context for the action, it’s clearly the case that this isn’t a story-driven game.\n\nThe driving force behind Danmaku Unlimited 2 stems from its well-polished, highly-refined core gameplay. A typical scenario begins with the player gunning down countless enemies as they appear at the top of the screen, all the while avoiding the beautiful but deadly hail of bullets sent the player’s way. Defeating enemies causes scoring items to appear and fall towards the bottom of the screen. The final phase of each level is indicated by a boss, who throws a series of different bullet patterns at the player in sequence, switching to the next pattern each time the player inflicts a certain amount of damage upon the boss. Dealing with such heavy densities of enemy fire can prove troublesome, but that’s where ‘Trance’ comes in. Destroying one’s opponents charges the Trance Gauge. When the gauge is full, Trance can be activated, converting bullets in the player’s immediate vicinity into scoring items and also enabling the player to unleash more powerful attacks than before.\n\nThe enemy placement within each level has been well-thought through. Weaker enemies are often clumped together, prompting the player to mow them down in quick succession to boost their score, while stronger enemies like to hide at the top of the screen, peppering the player with bullets and forcing them to take evasive action. However the bullet count consistently remains quite low, particularly for a game seeking to emulate a doujin shmup. It isn’t made any more challenging by the fact that the bullets also tend to move rather slowly. Those two factors lead to the game feeling somewhat easier than what one might initially expect, which could be a good or bad thing, depending on one’s past experience with bullet hell games. Players who are no strangers to the conventions of the genre are more than likely to find themselves underwhelmed even on higher difficulties, which is a shame, considering that those are the people most likely to possess the strongest appreciation for the doujin shmup.\n\nBefore setting off to battle; either from the start of the game or from any stage of the player’s choosing via ‘Free Play’; one may choose from one of two modes. ‘Burst Mode’ provides the player with a potent beam attack which can be used for going on the offensive, or for clearing a path through enemy bullets. The advantages afforded to the player by having such a tool at their disposal are offset by their inability to generate scoring items by killing enemies through the use of normal fire: accurate, efficient use of the beam attack and Trance become the only means of guaranteeing a high score. ‘Classic Mode’ offers up more a traditional bullet hell experience that those already acquainted with the genre should feel right at home with, in which attacks of any sort are adequate for creating scoring items.\n\nThe beam attack and Trance are both well-conceived mechanics. They can double up as additional defensive measures for those getting to grips with the action, while also serving as means for securing additional points, for individuals already on top of things.\n\nPlayers operate the Senko fighter, a versatile craft capable of undergoing numerous upgrades to suit the situation as necessary. Playing the game in any mode earns the player experience. Accumulating experience will gradually allow the player to progress in rank until they hit the top and become an Ace. As rank increases so too do the player’s options to outfit the Senko with the capabilities of their choosing. Players can opt for three different forms of attack for their fighter, in addition to the beam attack. It’s possible to take multiple forms of attack for the sake of versatility, or to focus on upgrading one in order to support a specific playstyle. Those willing to forego the luxury of having extra lives and credits at their disposal will find themselves able to maximize their offensive capabilities. This upgrade system gives players a chance to experiment and find a playstyle that works for them, while also lending the game additional replayability. It’s a nice touch, and one that feels original but still has its place in a bullet hell game.\n\nDanmaku Unlimited 2 is a visually stunning 2D piece – the graphics are easily some of the best seen in a bullet hell game in recent times. The cyan/purple colour palette gives the game’s environments an ‘otherworldly’ look, but not one that feels too far-fetched. Ships have a bold, coloured outline that makes them stand out, even when the screen is literally filled with explosions and scoring items. The centralized HUD also makes a difference: it’s nice not having to take yours eyes too far from the action to glance at some game-critical info. A cyan-coloured dot marks the player ship’s hitbox, which still remains easy to spot in the midst of a heated battle, thanks to the trail it gives off. Unfortunately the same can’t be said about the game’s audio. Most; if not all; of the music quickly gets repetitive. The sound effects themselves are surprisingly weak, and don’t have any real impact, with some explosions being barely even audible even at higher volume levels.\n\nOverall Danmaku Unlimited 2 is a fairly enjoyable game that’s likely to find the most favour with those caught in the middle-ground. Long-time veterans of the genre might find the experience a little too light, but for the uninitiated and anyone with only a moderate degree of bullet hell experience, Doragon Entertainment’s love letter to fans of the doujin shmup delivers an entertaining package that; generally speaking; knows and understands at least part of its audience.","February 1, 2015","true","10.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
