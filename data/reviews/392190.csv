The controls were fantastic the haptic feedback on your racket hand when you swing is what makes this game awesome.\n\nPros:\nGreat control scheme\nHitting the tennis ball people is a lot of fun\nCons:\nNot a lot of content. I played this game for about half an hour and really felt like I experienced all there is to experience. I cant see myself playing this anymore then I have.\nNo AI you hit the ball then teleport across the court and hit it back to yourself\nNo way to freely move. I had to hit the ball near where I wanted to teleport to get there, a means of teleporting to a specific location would improve this game a lot.\nPrice\nTLDR:\n\nOverall this game is fun put it is definitely not worth the $20 I have requested a refund but I would gladly repurchase this game and change this review if the price is lowered and when an AI is added to play against similar to WII Tennis.","April 6","false","0.5"," 30 of 31 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","30","31","0","0"

I was wrong. I played it for five minutes and ran out of things to do. Additionally, the one thing that it does, it doesn't do well. If you swing too fast, the racquet passes through the ball. You cannot put any type of spin on the ball, and it just doesn't seem like the ball is going in the direction that it should. Overall, it's cute, and I would probably pick it up for about $2.99. However, it definitely isn't worth the current price, or even the sale price for that matter.","May 6","false","0.1"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

For those of us who play non-VR tennis, there are some problems: any kind of racquet-head speed results in missing the ball, so you have to swing very slowly. Adjusting the grip (even to an Eastern grip) causes the ball to fly into the bottom of the net. The length of the racquet is wrong on the backhand side, so you miss way more than you should. You can't slice, or put any kind of spin on the ball. If you try to put topspin on the ball, you just hit a lob that goes 10 meters up.\nI could continue, but those are some of the issues I have.","May 5","true","9.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
