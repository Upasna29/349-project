This is truthfully one of the craziest indie game I've played in a long time, with a gameplay that is so simple but yet so addictive!\n\nTo put it short, you control a sinusoidal wave with your mouse, modifying its lenght and height as it suits you to catch all the coloured circles scattered around.\n\nThe content is massive, more than a 100 levels for the campaign, and as much in the challenge mode.  Waveform will suit any kind of gamer, casual or hardcore. A bottle of aspirin is highly required if you aim to 100% complete every single level available !\n\nThere's even a survival mode with leaderboards, just in case you want to prove you're a better wave rider than the rest of the world.\n\nAlso, thumbs up for the best ending level in the history of Wavelenght gaming.\n\nI strongly recommend this game!\nTotally worth its full price.

You control the amplitude and wavelength of an orb to run through a gauntlet of space objects. The control aspect is quite intuitive with a mouse, but getting the waveform to follow just the right path is more than tricky--it's downright difficult.\n\nWhat I didn't realize after completing Pluto is that there are many other planets to be completed.

You move its path.\nAnd its path, as the name implies, is a waveform.\nVertical mouse dragging causes the trough and valley of the wave to change, horozontally dragging changes the steepness of the line.\n\nThis is very hard to control, but in this case, that's a good thing. The controls work. They're not jerky, they're not too fast or too slow, every mistake is your own. But unlike in some other games, I feel an incentive to learn and adjust to the system.\n\nIt also looks pretty large as well. The first planet has 8 levels, so I'd assume that's standard and there are 9 planets. So you get 72 levels with the game, and if you feel like getting the DLC (which I did, simply because it was also on sale and $0.14 at the time I bought it), you get about 8 more.\n\nEven when you're done with the levels there's still a high score board to work at. Upon clearing a planet you unlock an unlimited mode for it. I'm not sure what the difference between Pluto unlimited and Mercury unlimited is, but if I were to guess I'd say each planet has slightly different mechanics.\n\nAll in all I think this could be one of those weird little gems with a bit more work put into it. For less than a dollar though, I definitely recommend it. For that price you'd get 4 runs at it in an arcade, but here you're getting full access.","November 4, 2015","true","1.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

At constant speed, when the frequency increase, the wavelength will decrease.\n\nIn this game, you have to modify the wavelength and amplitude and guide the particle to collect light orbs in order to score points. Thus, you're playing a Displacement-Distance (s-d) graph game. Where amplitude (a) and wavelength (λ) will be playing as the main role of the game.\n\nThe bigger the amplitude, the shorter the wavelength, the faster the particle will travel throughout the wave.\nVice versa, the larger the wavelength, the smaller the amplitude, the slower the particle will travel throughout the wave.\n\nBasically this concept is easy to understand with this Waveform Simulator, however to modify the wavelength while the particle is traveling at super speed will be tough and challenging for some players to master this game.\n\nI love Physics, that's why I bought this game.","April 14, 2015","true","3.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Admittedly some of the features introduced can be quite obnoxious (particularly wormholes) but it's a genuinely enjoyable challenge of skill and timing.\n\nThen you get to the last set of planets and are immediately gated by obnoxious requirements. You see, at each level you are scored a percentage, which awards you a number of stars rounded down to the lowest ten e.g. 79% = 7 stars! Can you see where this is going? Waveform ultimately turns into an obnoxiously grind-fest wherein you're playing the same level over and over to scrap an extra few points out to potentially have enough stars to unlock another level or two. This star requirement is present throughout the game but it really ramps up towards the end.\n\nHonestly it's quite a fun game, but I can't imagine actually finishing it. Probably the perfect tablet game for killing time as you gather those last few stars at a glacial pace over the course of a few weeks.

Prepare to miss a ton of stuff and/or die nine out of ten times.\nThere's literally no room for experimentation and when what you're supposed to do isn't immediately clear (which is often) you're generally punished for trying to figure things out. Combine that with how frustratingly precise the waves you need to make are a lot of the time and the end result is just a tedious mess of a game.

And this really is as pure of a game as I've played in a long time.\n\nYou have a small ball of light trying to traverse the cosmos (various maps set against a back drop of space) by way of a sine wave. You control its travel by altering the sine wave...move the mouse up / down and the amplitude (height) grows / diminshes...move the mouse left / right and the frequency increases / decreases (how steep it goes up / down). Hit power ups, multipliers, and various other typical point scoring devices to get a high score and progress from map to map. Dodge black matter and various other space based hazards otherwise you lose points / fail the map.\n\nThe basic gameplay structure (points based map completion) is old hat, but the mechanic of controlling  something via manipulation of a sine wave is unique and utterly appropriate for the simple premise of the game. Combined with a an excellent soundtrack (which somehow manages to combine a light hearted sound with something suitable to wandering through the depths of space) you'll find yourself smiling as you play this wonderful game.","June 26, 2015","true","2.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

That's it. Despite the simplicity of the premise, the game plays surprisingly well, and has way more effort put into levels, art, music, and even writing, than one might expect from something with such a minimalist concept. Achieving 100% on all levels must be incredibly frustrating, though.\n\nP.S.\nOn Linux, the game froze a few times on my computer (mostly when alt-tabbing and opening Steam overlay). Running it in a borderless window rather than full-screen seemed to alleviate that problem. If you take a look at the forums, some people have reported similar issues with Windows, too, as well as gave some solutions on how to mitigate them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zirune/recommended/204180/","zirune","zirune","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zirune/","992 products in account","Waveform is a perfect example of a unique idea done right. The gameplay is executed flawlessly, the style is unique, and there is certainly plenty of meat to the game. The only real downfall is that it seems to be undedicated to a single audience; it seems to be and plays somewhat like a puzzle game yet is at times extremely fast-paced and incredibly difficult, two things which are generally not seen together. For what it does, Waveform is an amazing game, and one that many hours could be poured into.\n\nThe first hurdle newcomers to the game will encounter is the gameplay mechanics. Not because they're flawed and unplayable, but because they're different than anything else you've likely played before, meaning it can take an hour or two of trial and error to truly understand how to use it. It's honestly easier to see in Waveform's trailer than it is to explain, but to sum it up: You control a wavy line of light, and the only thing you can't do with it is slow it down. Your goal is to collect orbs and waves while avoiding various obstacles and using the environment to your advantage to change your path or the objects around you.\n\nThe second thing that will likely be offputting is the game's difficulty. Expect to have to repeat levels and sections of levels multiple times in order to simply pass the level, especially if it's a level that requires (near-)perfection in a certain section in order to succeed. When you finally do succeed, don't be surprised to receive a rating of 30%, either, as the game is quite stingy with its ratings, requiring practically flawless runs of an entire level to get the full 10-star 100% rating. Luckily, the game does have checkpoints and levels generally aren't terribly long, plus you don't need anywhere near the max number of stars to access the levels you need them to unlock. Still, you're likely to end up frustrated at times with Waveform, especially if you're the completionist type.\n\nOther than those potential issues and some others like repetitive audio, Waveform is a great game. It's very chill for the most part, unless you're going for 100% in every level or run into a difficult level or section. There are little bits of story after some levels that, while not exactly Mass Effect-level engrossing, are intriguing. Despite the difficulty, there will be few places where it feels like the mistakes you make are the fault of the game. You won't be able to find a game elsewhere like it, and it does what it does well, thus Waveform gets a strong recommend from me.","January 24, 2014","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's fresh gameplay is strangely addicting, and the speed and movement of the game allows for a lot of adaptability and logic from the player's end. The game doesn't have any crippling flaws. Whenever I messed up, it was my fault not the games. But the game seems to have a bit of a resentful attitude towards adequacy. When I got to the Mercury and Sun levels, the game continuously smacked me in the forehead, saying, "450 stars!? You call that good! Go back and get some more, you ingrateful fool!". For most of those levels, I'd continuously roll my eyes as I'd scroll back to Pluto and Neptune to replay levels I had already beat just to continue playing the game. If this doesn't bother you or you're rather the perfectionist, this game is perfect for you. I'd just advise caution to people who like to keep their casual games... casual.","June 18, 2015","true","5.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A game that can stay fresh the whole way means something.\nSimple to control. It started out a bit hard to figure out the controls, but after a few beginner levels it was so satisfying to play.\n\n\nCons: Levels are blocked with pre-requisites, so I reached the final world only to realize that I needed a certain amount of stars (In-game overall score) to progress.

On top of that, it has a "very positive" rating on Steam. , I was pretty surprised that this was on sale for such a low price. "Those reviews have got to be wrong then", I thought.

When I saw the price, I thought, "this must be junk". Then I noticed the Metacritic score (81 from reviewers)... so I went to Metacritic and discovered that users gave it a 7.8 rating. On top of that, it has a "very positive" rating on Steam. , I was pretty surprised that this was on sale for such a low price. "Those reviews have got to be wrong then", I thought. Turns out I was the one in the wrong!\n\nThis is a very well thought out (and very very tricky!) puzzle game. It isn't a game I could sit and play for hours - but that isn't because the game is bad. It is actually a cracking game! And it is likely the best 15 pence I have ever spent on a game. You "simply" move the mouse to increase/decrease the frequency and the amplitude of the waveform, in order to pick up little blue orbs, go through gates, avoid black bricks, and retrace predefined waveform snippets.\n\nI give this game 7.5 out of 10.\n\nGet it now, while it is on sale. :) You won't be disappointed. :D","June 24, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game runs fantastic on linux, and offers a huge amount of content for those who become enamored with its simplistic formula: hidden levels, endless mode, challenge levels, chase sequences, and mechanics exclusive to levels are used to great effect.\n\nThe initial campaign has a solid pace (for the beginning), with new aspects being spinkled in frequently and gradually becoming more difficult, and should last around 8 hours. However, towards the late game, you will be required to grind to gain access to the game's later levels if you score below a certain threshold consistently, as I did. Fortunately it's not too much of a chore to do so, since your skill at the game will allow you to easily ace the earlier levels.\n\nAll in all, Waveform is stellar if you can afford the pricey 19 cent pricetag. It'll lure you in with its bargain, and pleasantly surprise you with its quality.","June 26, 2015","true","8.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Every few levels, you're dealing with new mechanics, whether it be a threat, or a new way to move, on top of the already existing mechanics. Once you get past a few sets of levels, it becomes harder and harder to focus on adjusting your wave when you're dodging well...many things.\n\nThe soundtrack is well done and sortof puts you into a trance. It's really enjoyable and I'd listen to it for ages. The game itself offers a lot of interesting gameplay for it's low, low price.

The basic concept here is you need to match the wave to a shape that collects all the orbs while avoiding what appeard to be black holes or space debris. The game ahs allot of levels one for each planet in our solar system and DLC for those super keen but overall it falls a bit flat with repitiion. Not bad for short sessions or time killers.

You're controlling the path of a little orb by manipulating a wave. Collect orbs and score high.\n\nThis game is however, anything but simple. Every few levels, you're dealing with new mechanics, whether it be a threat, or a new way to move, on top of the already existing mechanics. Once you get past a few sets of levels, it becomes harder and harder to focus on adjusting your wave when you're dodging well...many things.\n\nThe soundtrack is well done and sortof puts you into a trance. It's really enjoyable and I'd listen to it for ages. The game itself offers a lot of interesting gameplay for it's low, low price.

It's a great game to play while listening to your own music or a podcast, in that way, it is quite relaxing. The difficulty increases as you progress, but it's a lot of fun to go back to the first levels and realize that even though they are the same levels, the player has improved considerably and gained a lot of skill with no need for any type of ingame mechanics. In a way it's you, the player, the one who's leveled up. And that's something I really appreciate and find interesting.\n\nHowever, the game gets repetitive soon enough. I had planned to see the end of the game, but right before the final stages, you basically have to go all the way back and get better scores in every level for you to be able to carry on. As I said, that can be fun to do once or twice to see how you have improved, but to do them (almost) all again?\nTo be honest, the game had already started to get quite tedious at this point and blocking the end behind a score didn't really help. Many casual players will probably see this as a burden, more than anything else. And I don't think Waveform appeals to a lot of hardcore players, as the reviews in steam show (as far as I can see not many have played more than an hour).\n\nSo to sum it up:\n\n+ very cheap price\n+ interesting and original concept\n+ natural progression of player's skills\n+ relaxing and slow paced: perfect if you want to listen to podcasts or music while playing\n\n- ending blocked behind score requirements, forcing you to play almost everything again\n- quite repetitive","April 19","true","8.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Simple yet effective, probably not going to Rule The Gameplaying World or anything but in this particular case the Metacritic score is pretty much right on the money. It can also be played with one hand, in case you're crippled or you like jacking off to waveforms.\n\nApropos of nothing, except for the stuff it relates to: I have a friend who actually does that (jacks off to waveforms), his name is Chumpy because he's a BIG TIME Chump and is getting deported from Canada due to trying to put his anatomy inside a wall outlet at Rogers Centre one time too many also he keeps calling it the C.N. Tower which aggravates the Prime Minister to no end. Anyway this is probably his favorite game because he's an Engineer and also a pervert and can move the waveforms around while also cranking his voltometer. He gets "amped up" for ohms. haha also that's why this game is called a "Simulation" even though it is in no fu­cking way a "Simulator" and whoever added it to the Simulator category should be forced to cosplay as Robby the Robot when Chumpy's around. But also this game simulates the mind of Chumpy pretty well so that's why it's a Simulation game. ok well bye","May 2, 2015","true","0.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

The price was taken down to a mere 24 cents. I decided to buy it.\n\nI'm quite pleased. Waveform is has a high level of good design for an indie game, and is more than worth the purchase -- even at its normal, non-discounted price.\n\nThe game looks quite complicated in the trailer, and to some extent, it is. Still, it's not as complex as it looks, for whatever that's worth.\n\nControls are actually quite simple. "You", or the little orb on the left which is moving right, travel in the shape of a sine wave. This is because you play the role of a photon, which behaves as a wave. (And a particle, but lets not get too sciencey) You increase/decrease your frequency by moving the mouse left/right, and you increase/decrease your amplitude by moving the mouse up/down. That's the full extent of the game controls, besides pause, of course.\n\nIn layman's terms, you follow a wibbly-wobbly line. Mouse left or right to make your wibble-wobble do a full wibble and wobble in less or more time, and mouse up or down to make the top of the wibble higher or lower.\n\nThis is a difficult mechanic to toy with, but the game has a gentle difficulty curve. The first level contains only light orbs -- doodads you collect to score points. The next few contain dark matter -- doodads you don't want to touch. Regardless, the game does a very good job of telegraphing what you need to do, and often, your goal of collecting light orbs coincides with a path that avoids all dark matter.\n\nOver the course of the game, you are introduced to more and more objects that you can interact with. Mirrors can be used to reflect your wave, orbiters can be used to collect light orbs in a wider radius, and wormholes can be used to warp past deadly clusters of bad stuff. These are just a few examples; the list goes on.\n\nThe game is also designed to appeal well to both the casual and hardcore audience. Casual players can find suitable challenge in simply completing the core levels. Hardcore players can find suitable challenging in gaining a 100% score in every level. The game doesn't end there either; it also includes "deep space modes", which are randomly-generated endless levels that challenge you to survive against harder scenarioes while collecting points and speeding up ever-so-slightly.","April 9, 2015","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The soundtrack was relaxing and the graphics had a nice, spacey feeling to them. Gameplay wise this game has a perfect difficulty curve, right when you have mastered one aspect and start to get bored, a new gimmick is introduced to keep you on your toes. While it is easy to complete all the diferent levels, it is extremely hard to get 100% in every single one of them, so people who were looking for a challenge won't be dissapointed.\nUltimately, I would have been willing to pay the full price for this game, it was definitely worth it, and for a meager 24 cents  it was one of the best purchases I have ever made.","April 13, 2015","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are cool too. But the best thing in my opinion, is that it never lets you get bored, there is always new stuff and interesting mechanisms around the corner as you progress.

It's nice, simple, and is pretty comforting to play after a day of action packed online shooters. I have to say I love it. It has a good difficulty curve (literally I might add), the music is relaxing, and for the price of a hamburger at a fast food joint (or 20 cents if you're getting it on sale) you really can't go wrong here. So far I haven't unlocked all the content, but I like what I see so far. I'll probably be updating this review as time passes, but it won't change the recommendation I give it. I'm not even half-way in, and I've spent several hours on this. usually indie games like this are super short, so I'm pleasantly surprised.","June 16, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Very relaxing and chill.\n+ Original idea.  I enjoy puzzle games and this one is unique.\n+ Beautiful graphics.  The visuals combined with the music is very soothing.\n\nVERY BIG CON:\n- There is no option to invert the controls! This makes it an issue for me, who likes to 100% the levels, and the counter-intuitive controls make it very difficult to do since this game is unforgiving.  It is beyond frustrating when I move the mouse up and expect the wave to go down, and then remember, oh, I can't do that in this game.\n\nI absolutely love music-based games (Waves, Every Extend Extra, Chime, Rez, Bit-Trip Runner, etc) and I am really sad that the controls in this game bother me so much.  It's almost a deal-breaker, but I will keep at it.  I cannot believe this game has been out for so long without an update to invert the controls.  Please fix this.  =[","March 21","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a very interesting concept and in the right frame of mind could be absolute heaven.\n\nYou are a dot following a wave up and down.  There are things that you want your dot to hit.  In order to hit the things, you have to alter the wave.   There are 2 ways you can control the wave.  I apologize if I misuse any terms as directly dealing with waves isn't part of my day to day life.\n\nThe X axis controls the frequency.  Left to right makes the wave go up and down slower.  Right to left makes the wave go up and down faster.  So if you go all the way to the left, your dot is bouncing up and down like a chihuahua on crack whereas all the way to the right would be like very slowly hitting a speed bump.\n\nThe Y axis controls the amplitude.  Top to bottom makes the wave move a smaller distance up and down.  Bottom to top makes the wave travel a father distance up and down.  So bottom to top makes it bounce up and down a lot farther and top to bottom makes it kind of squiggle in the middle of the screen.\n\nWith that being said, I only played it for a little while before it stressed me out.  Having to keep both frequency and amplitude in your head at the same time while things are flying by you is a lot to take in.\n\nI will definitely return to this game but it'll have to catch me on the right day and today is just not one of those days.  I would definitely recommend it if you are looking for a break from the norm or have a thing for physics.","November 9, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
