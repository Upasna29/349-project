Some of them were harder or easier to get into but in my opinion, Phoenix Force is a great way to start your journey with this kind of games.\nStarts very easy - with one enemy which you can learn about, then starts to add more of them with even more different and more complicated attacks. Some of the combinations are deadly and demand from player to avoid them cleverly and that's where most fun thing starts. Every phoenix in this game comes with up unique skill so that every player can find a one that will fit in his play style to beat every level. There are 200 levels in total (100 in normal game + 100 in challenge mode) but these are really short and easy to beat once you will get a grip of everything.\nIt's not a hardcore Bullet Hell game like Touhou, but it's a definitely worth to play if you want something easier from this genre.","November 28, 2014","true","7.1"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","1"

The different birds you unlock have different special abilities,  the bosses are varied and interesting. It's not bad game, it would be amazing for a free flash game or $1 mobile game.

In some levels you battle multiple bosses which is cool but also kind of seems like padding - but some combinations are very frustrating and make me wonder how much they play tested this game. In a good bullet hell game you die because you messed up, by throwing to random bosses together this game put you in situations you can't anticipate or escape from so it just becomes a game of spray and pray.\n\nThe devs are being rather greedy - if you can get this game cheap go for it, it's fun and will keep you entertained for a while.","March 13, 2015","false","1.3"," 26 of 41 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","26","41","0","0"

You can level up your Phoenix, and unlock new ones, but there isn't any feeling of worthwhile progression. I wouldn't recommend this game.\n\nDesign wise the game is based on a converted version of their previous free flash game.

For what it is, it's okay.\n\nGOOD\n\nThe second I saw Phoenix Force's artstyle I was in love.  It's a very smooth looking and neat artstyle.  All of the bosses are fairly unique looking and each one has its own attack pattern.  There are 200 levels which seem pretty significant at first but each level is only at most 30 seconds long.  Meaning you could play in bite sized intervals or go through every level fairly quickly.\n\nBAD\n\nDespite the great artstyle one extremely glaring flaw shows in it.  There are a lot of recoloured bosses.  Each one that gets recoloured has a slightly different attack pattern which might only catch you off guard once.  This game also has a... different view on what is difficult.  Instead of a single boss with a distinctive pattern, the game instead throws more than one boss at you.  It's difficult but a cheap way to raise difficulty.  With later levels having four bosses at once.  Since they do this many levels consist of fighting one boss, then that boss paired with another, then another boss.  I'm not expecting 100 unique bosses for every level but it feels kind of lazy padding.  Characters have little distinction between each other and it's likely you'll just be using the very first one just because he has the strongest bullet.  A little more interactivity would have been great, such as starting with the ability on cooldown and clicking when you want to use it.  Even if it had a longer cooldown.","December 16, 2014","false","1.1"," 13 of 24 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","13","24","0","3"

On the positive it is a clever game with a few good ideas, such as the incorporation of RPG elements and focusing the game on boss fights.  However, the game is hampered by a few issues that put it a step behind other, better, shoot-'em-ups like Crimzon Clover.\n\nThe first is the fact that there is no slowdown button.  There is no control button to slow your phoenix down to navigate the more complex fields of bullets.  Instead, the analog stick is pressure sensitive.  So, when you're using the lighter touch on the analog stick you're sacrificing maneuverability for movement safety, hoping you can maintain control.\n\nA second big problem is the way the game is structured.  Since you only have a single life per fight, if you get hit, you have to go through a continue screen that allows you to exit to the map or select another phoenix.  These menus are animated.  Overly-animated menus are actually a huge pet-peeve of mine because they add that 1 second that's just enough to be irritating between bouts.  On later fights where death is a regular risk, you will go through this a lot, especially due to the often imprecise controls.\n\nThirdly, there's the repetitive bosses.  You will fight the same bosses over and over, ad-nauseum, throughout the game.  As you move forward, many of these bosses with become harder.  Either their attack patterns will change, their bullets will move faster or start homing in on you, or you will see some combination thereof.  When the ideas for tough bosses run out, the game is padded out with fights against two bosses simultaneously, which is fine, but still repetitive.  After seeing the same skeleton boss over and over through the game it got pretty old.\n\nFinally, and arguably the most important, is this is a very, very simple game.  Unlike a lot of the best shooters ever made, Phoenix Force does little in terms of gameplay.  You auto-fire during the fights, so your job basically becomes "dodge the things".  The bosses all move the same way, waving left to right across the top of the screen, and while their attacks are varied, simply moving in a U-pattern following them and focusing attacks on them between their pattern cycles will win you just about every fight.  What I'm saying is, there is no really unique concept here.  There are a ton of bullet hell shooters on Steam now and given the quality of so many of them, I cannot justify buying this game unless you have all of the other good ones in your library already.\n\nNot to say Phoenix Force is a bad game, but in all of its simplicity and attempts to be a progressive experience rather than a flashy arcade game, it loses a lot of the fun factor so many other games in this genre have.  The reason people love games like Giga Wing, the Touhou shooters or the masterpiece that is Ikaruga is BECAUSE they are varied and challenging arcade-style experiences.  The lack of simple RPG elements does not make them lesser games, just as the presence of those elements in Phoenix Force does not make it great.","August 13, 2015","false","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaraKalat/recommended/332480/","MaraKalat","Mara","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MaraKalat/","1228 products in account","Vertical shooters are an interesting genre. They strip away any notion of exploration and (often) narrative to instead focus on delivering high speed action to the player.\nPhoenix Force goes a step further and gets rid of everything except the boss battles.\n\nThere's only an implied story in this, as a Phoenix you travel the world (like, Earth) continent by continent, fighting your way through 100 boss fights. For your troubles each victory gives you some upgrade tokens (proportional to the number of bosses were in the fight), some stages also give you direct stat boosts for your team or, most importantly, add a playable phoenix to the titular force.\n\nEvery phoenix controls roughly the same, you move your mythological bird around using the mouse (move it too fast and it will lag behind the cursor a bit) and automatically fires up at the boss or bosses that swerve around at the top of the screen. Once you get hit by a shot from a boss you're dead and immediately thrown back to the phoenix selection screen to try again. Losing is painless, quick and expected along your journey. Each phoenix has a neat special power to differentiate it though, from a fire wave that triggers every dozen or so seconds to bullets homing in on your enemies to being able to teleport around the map (with a short cooldown).\nThese powers do a nice job mixing up the gameplay, and I felt myself switching phoenix every now and then to chance my approach to a level.\n\nThe earlier mentioned upgrade tokens are used to increase the level of your phoenixes. Fortunately, they all level at the same time, which means that if you've levelled up your standard fire phoenix to level 9 and then get the ice phoenix it will also be level 9. All of them are always the same level, meaning you are always free to try a different approach or strategy. This is a great thing.\n\nUnfortunately, you don't really NEED to switch things up though. As with Japanese Danmaku (or 'Bullet Hell') games the primary concern lies in staying alive long enough to take down the boss. This means that mostly you'll just be swerving out of harm's way as the bosses shower you with projectiles of various types. The different phoenix powers mix things up, but not to a great extent.\n\nLevelling up a phoenix in your team (and, with it, the entire team) will raise its attack power and lower the cooldown period between skill uses if it has any. It's a completely linear and straightforward system, but it does mean that you can redo levels to get a bit stronger before tackling a level you're stuck at. Unfortunately failing a level does not get you a reward, which means it can be frustrating to try and fail a level a dozen times, it would have been neat to have at least something for the player's troubles. A victory gives 5-20 upgrade tokens, so just getting 1 token every time you lose would have been a pleasant gesture.\n\nAbout halfway through the game (just after winning your first battle against 4 bosses at the same time) you unlock Challenge Mode, which pits you against 4 random bosses you've beaten so far. This is the only extra mode the game has to offer, and I'm glad it's there, but it can be frustrating as well. You get upgrade tokens normally for each victory, but the main prize to aim for is the final phoenix, Lich, which is unlocked when you win 100 challenge fights. This is exactly as many levels as the campaign has. I made it through, but was thoroughly sick of them when I did.\nThe final phoenix definitely mixes things up though, and is arguably a lot harder to play as than the other 5. Its shots start off very weak, but gain strength every time you graze  (almost get hit by) a projectile. This was great fun, but it's unlocked so late that I was almost done with the campaign by then and I didn't end up using it much.\n\nAfter 100 campaign boss fights the game ends. You get a short slideshow of the phoenixes congregating around a magical tree of some kind (which, if the map you've been traversing is any indication, is apparently in Portugal). Did the evil boss monsters come from there? I don't know, maybe. There's no story here either to make things clearer.\n\nThere is one thing I haven't touched upon yet in this review, and that's the actual bosses. 100 boss fights sound ridiculous on paper, no game has 100 bosses, and this game is no different. Each continent (of which there are 4 in the game, I guess Australia and Africa don't have giant monsters floating over them? Good for them!) has four or so different types of boss that it introduces. Each boss has distinctly different attack types, which range from easy to dodge (fire breathing dragons, giant floating eyeballs shooting straight-lined lasers) to downright nefarious (harpies showering the screen with falling feathers, flying demons that alternate spewing out acid pools and smoke screens) as you traverse the continents. Design and variety of the bosses is pretty good, with every manner of flying mythological beastie being thrown your way as the game progresses.\nEach new boss type gets introduced in a one on one stage so you can get familiar with its attacks, but the rest are generally made up of different teams of bosses attempting to take you down. No level is quite the same, but some of them are pretty similar.\n\nPhoenix Force sets out to do a simple thing, deliver excellent vertical shooter boss battles with minimal surrounding hassle.\nIt achieves this, but could have done with some more variety in its battles and maybe some of that hassle after all (e.g. a deeper upgrade system).\nDefinitely recommending this though, make up your own mind if it's a game for you.","March 2, 2015","true","4.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's a very, very challenging game, and I absolutely recommend it.\n\nAs for the story, a group of phoenixes is tasked with defeating hordes of enemies, before they can reach a dying tree to revive it. 100 Levels, and 100 Extra Challenges (to unlock the 6th and last phoenix) offer hours of challenging bullet dodging and thinking of which phoenix to pick.\n\nFury, the starter phoenix, is able to elimite bullets directly in front of him, Cryo will freeze all enemies for a couple of seconds, Tupa is able to teleport around on the field, Gaia simply has homing shots (which will always attack the nearest enemy), Gast is able to summon a shield, and Lich gains orbs shooting along with it the more health it drains from the enemies.\n\nAnd with this force, you should be able to clear all the levels - but be prepared to get frustrated at some of the more tricky enemy types!","February 3, 2015","true","29.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/332480/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","First off. If you read my blog (all three of you) you're sure to see this exact but not quite review for the Desura version. I'm allowed to be lazy once in awhile...right?\n\nAnother 2D shooter, I'm guessing this was also a cell-phone port. The Phoenix Force travels the globe looking for minions of evil, and then blows them away. It's an adequate time-waster, something you can play for a few minutes and still make some progress. This game is 100 stages of boss-fights. Now that doesn't mean there are 100 bosses. There are several types, and each stage can have up to four of them on the battlefield.\n\nThe Phoenix Force consists of five different phoenixes. Auto-fire is constantly on and they regularly trigger their special ability (if they have one). Basically all you're doing is dodging bullets. Fans of scoring systems or even just points in general are left out in the cold. No matter how many enemy bullets you rub up against, or how close you are to the boss when it's defeated, there are no bonus points of any kind. Merely surviving is enough to earn a gold star, or a power-up, or a speed-up. The only points earned are experience, which you can cash in for a stronger bird. I went with the ice-phoenix. He has a name but I don't care. All I care about is that his special ability can freeze bosses for a couple seconds and slow down their attacks. The shield phoenix is also very helpful. At a high enough level it pops out a shield every 12 seconds.\n\nThat's the extent of the game really, just a lot of boss-fights. Due to the bite-sized nature of the game I stuck with it. The act of dodging bullets will always remain compelling to me. Perhaps it's a side-effect of the hundreds of 2D shooters I've played over the years. Hundreds? Really?! I mean, it definitely feels like hundreds sometimes. When you've got your face plastered onto the screen making those life or death millimeter-movements, everything starts to blend together.\n\nBut that's not all Phoenix Force has to offer! About mid-way through you unlock the option to fight random battles, 100 more of them. I know what you're thinking: "A hundred boss-fights!? That's 10 times 10!!!" Yep, it is a pretty big number. The game even awards a new phoenix if you win all 100 battles. In the Desura version there were 1,000 battle and no bonus phoenix. I can't imagine many people getting that far.\n\nStill, I have to give credit where it's due, some of the boss-fights are pretty neat. When every stage is self-contained, I guess it's a springboard to experiment with tons of combinations. Sure enough enemies can clutter the screen in bullets, but give them unique attacks that come from all different directions, and you'll see something that's rather impressive.\n\nLevel 100 is a very special case. A blue mummy fires yellow bullets that directly target the player, a pink mummy fires pink bullets that spread outward. A jolly green golem creates shields and throws stalactites with messy hit-boxes (they can sometimes kill you if they're close enough). A snake fires bullets that collide with other bullets to make bullet explosions. Side note: One day I'll do a shmup review and not even use the word "bullet", wouldn't that be astounding?\n\nAnyway, with all four of these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s firing at once, it's easy to get tripped up. I'll dodge the yellow, only to get hit with the pinks, I'll dodge both of those to get hit by the explosions. Worst of all is when I finally establish control, only to forget about those screwy stalactites. I died more times on this stage alone than one of those ridiculous hidden final bosses found in Cave shooters. Sure, a giant mecha-hornet can turn a screen hot pink and I'll die a dozen or so times, but this particular encounter from a random cell-phone game lead to more deaths, simply because it started beating me psychologically. I'd die near the end of the fight, then take 2-3 more deaths at the beginning of future attempts. In all fairness, Phoenix Force makes you restart the stage if you die. If you manage to get to one of those secret Cave bosses, you can (usually) continue as many times as you like and the boss (usually) doesn't regain health.\n\nThe Steam version looks to be a fair bit more difficult. Usually when a couple of bosses are defeated in a level it becomes a cakewalk. Now bosses up their frequency of attacks. Also, your weapons seem to do a bit less damage than before. This leads to longer fights cluttered with more danger. On the bright side, all of the phoenixes (phoeni?) level-up at the same time, so nobody is left behind and underpowered.\n\nSo Phoenix Force, eh..I suppose it's worth a look. This is one of many games I've received through purchasing indie bundles. It's guaranteed that I wouldn't have bought this game by itself, but now that I've played through it, I'd say it's worth my time.\n\nFYI - Even though I completed every stage of the Desura version, I had to replay level 100 to get the achievement for it (the rest unlocked when I loaded my save). It was even more difficult. Good times.","November 20, 2014","true","2.2"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","1"

The unlockable phoenixes do alter the gameplay to a degree, and do help on the harder boss combinations, but don't utilize different fire rates or fire patterns. Regarding the boss characters, there's only about a dozen of them with two difficulty variations, so over the course of 100 stages (200 if you count the "bonus" ones), the player is bound to see quite a bit of repetition, and little variety - even the last stage is hardly creative. Most of the stages can be beaten with the starter phoenix on the first go, or abused with certain characters.\nConsidering it only lasted for 8 hours, and most of it was just grinding the "bonus" stages, which had inconsistent difficulty changes, it's not worth the 8 Euros it's trying to sell itself as, instead, pick it up for free if that's a possibility, at least just for the trading cards, or for a dollar or so if you're generous.","December 27, 2014","true","8.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The one thing that drives me off the ♥♥♥♥en wall about this game is the fact that say you kill an enemy their attack is still active if they do it before they die, other then that the gameplays pretty solid but unfortinatly doesn't have much to offer other then boss fights.

You're in for 100 levels of straight dodging and shooting action, and on each level there are 1-4 bosses whom you must take all at once (no other enemies), while dodging each and every one of their attacks, that's right guys, one hit and it's all over and you have to do that level all over again.\n\nIf that's not enough, hurting a boss enough unlocks their second and third tier attacks, and downing a boss makes all the other still alive bosses nastier by pumping up their attacks slightly. So not only you're dodging like crazy, you want to shoot at the specific boss you think is the most pain in the butt and you really don't want to face last.\n\nThere are like a dozen bosses each with their very specific and distinct attacks, and of course it gets pretty frantic how they are combined with several out at once. On the other hand you get to unlock like five phoenixes with distinct specials as well, and to level them up. The game kindly allows you to improve them all at once and you can try any level with the phoenix you think is best for the job, so don't worry, you can't make wrong choices and gimp yourself. It's just you, the player, versus the bosses, good old-fashioned fun.\n\nFor bringing back old school fun and challenge, I give it 3 out of 4 phoenixes.

That alone makes this game not crap.\n\nNot enough info?  Fine...\n\nPhoenix Force is a bullet hell shooter with no trash mobs, only bosses.  The same handful of bosses appear in various combinations of one to four at a time, which can get a little repetitive.  Each boss gains new attacks as it takes damage, and when one falls the others attack faster, so you'll need to choose your kill order wisely.\n\nYou can choose from six phoenices to play as, though only the ice bird is any good.  The purple bird was especially disappointing given the requirement to unlock it.  That said, the developer has shown a willingness to listen to player feedback, so character balance could change.  The once weak earth bird, for instance, got a big buff shortly after the game was released on Steam.\n\nI'd say this game is pretty good, despite the constant boss reuse.  It got me feeling pretty wired, which I think is a mark of good difficulty.  The mythological motif is also a nice departure from the usual spaceships.

Other than those issues the game plays fairly well. A lot of extra padding with the way challenge mode works but nothing too awful that its unbearable. A good pick for people who prefer hard games.","August 24, 2015","true","7.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even then, it feels like a Boss Rush RPG, since you can go back to prior stages and grind for level-up points if your power level is too weak. I don't know if that's really the idea with shmups, but I'll give it a recommend because it has cute artwork, I like the semi-transparent player fire (Touhou influence?), and I guess it'd be fun on a mobile if I had one that would run it (though maybe only South America since handheld shmups are kinda awful to control). Can't get the hang of using Tupã's teleport, though, and I needed a friend to tell me that it was a teleport power in the first place (yay being thrown into the game without any kind of instructions to explain the autofire and autobomb).","August 2, 2015","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Don't be fooled by the graphics or control simplicity, the gameplay is awesome. For those who already played the game in a phone, this conversion is very good: better controls, higher difficulty but more rewards to improving your phoenixes.\nThis is not an easy game and there are no difficulty levels so take this into consideration before buying it.","December 23, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
