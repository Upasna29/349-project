While it was released in 2003 it has nothing to envy to current indies or more "aesthetic" games. It drives one of the most amazing an beautifully written stories I've ever seen, it's an amazing and original open world adventure game that will keep you hooked for many hours.\n\n*While the games is amazing, the port is old and it's engine doesn't play too well in post Windows XP machines without some tweaking.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/recommended/15130/","Sequekhan","Sir Auron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/","280 products in account","So here's this game I played several times on the PS2, and it is SO FUN. PC is no exception.\n\nPeople may have seen the camera on the box art back in the day and said to themselves "Ew! Camera in the gameplay, no way!" Sure the camera is sometimes a necessary part of the game, but combat and stealth are major gameplay elements that shouldn't be overlooked.\n\nThe story centres on Jade and Pey'j, in a strange world where half-animal people walk around on two legs and talk. For example Pey'j has a definite boar-like appearance. The world is under siege from the Domz armada, and the Alpha Sections are there to stop them. During an attack Jade discovers she's out of credits and her lighthouse shield power is cut off. In an effort to make some credits she takes on a photography job for the local science centre, and through a turn of events ends up working for a secret underground movement called the Iris Network.\n\nThe plot is fairly straightforward - you go on missions looking for evidence, once you find the evidence you take photos of it, and then you get the hell outta there. The missions are few and large, and the best way to approach it is to go sneaky stealth mode on everything. It is possible to attack your enemies too, but you will have a hard time.\n\nGameplay combat is all 3rd-person, but not all of it is melee. There are battles on the water inside your 'tugboat', and towards the end of the game there is even a spaceship battle, which I thoroughly enjoyed. Enemies hit hard in melee combat though, so it pays to grab all the health upgrades you can find. These can be manually distributed to your companion too if you think they need it. As already mentioned, subterfuge is your friend - you will have more fun with sneak attacks and trickery than trying to face-tank your way though the game.\n\nOther gameplay elements include speed-races to get your stolen credits back, minigames (that game in the Akuda Bar is badass hard), finding all the species to photograph for more credits, finding all the pearls for more vehicle upgrades. There are a couple of foot-chases too, to add whipped cream to an already delicious cake of a game.\n\nSo how delicious is it? Well the music is a blast for starters. It has a wonderful style to it, melodious and alien. Well-suited to the game. The graphics are a little bland but good - with a main character like Jade it makes sense there's a bit of a green theme to it. Voice-actors have been cast well, there is a lot of great voice-acting in the game and it helps to suspend disbelief, helping immersion and reinforcing our empathy towards the characters.\n\nHighly recommended to anyone that loves stealth, a great story, or just wants to try something new. The hours I've played it on PC are not representative of my total hours (PC and PS2). Worth it just for the soundtrack!","November 11, 2015","true","8.8"," 58 of 61 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","58","61","2","6"

Without spoiling anything, Jade and Pey'j are a memorable duo, heartwarming characters in general, and there's still plenty of mystery surrounding them. Jade and Double H were a fun team as well, and there seems to be a lot of untold depth to even the minor characters, namely anyone found in the Akuda Bar\n-The soundtrack\n\nThe bad:\n\n-The camera is sometimes wonky, especially on the PC\n-It's kind of an extension of the camera problem, but controlling the game's two vehicles can be frustrating in some parts\n-A little short, could have been one level/mission longer imo, but that's because I really enjoyed what I got\n\nThe ugly:\n\n-The fact that this game was a commercial failure, isn't well known even to this day, and its sequel has been in development hell but is well deserving of existing already\n\nConclusion: Play this game. It's charming, unique, and refreshing despite being over a decade old.","May 4, 2015","true","22.0"," 51 of 52 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","51","52","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/linomaster300/recommended/15130/","linomaster300","Honeymaster | Unorganized","http://steamcommunity.com/id/linomaster300/","104 products in account","Hands down one of the best Action-Adventure game ive played to this date, I loved the charecters and story and this review will tell you why I personally enjoyed each aspect of the game. (Ubisoft release BGaE 2 Please!) Before you question that I don't have the hours played on this game I have played the ps2 version and the HD remastered verson on the Xbox 360 and completed it on each platform.\n\nWhat does the game offer in terms of what genre it is\nThe game is an Action/Adventure game with elements of Stealth and puzzle solving. The game doesnt throw you into battles all the time and most battles you can avoid by running away. The stealth in this game is almost completely optional unless theres a drone in the room, this drone only targets intruders when spotted and will instantly kill you which enforces you to be stealthy. There are puzzles to solve and most of them are easy to do like for example you have to redirect light beams to go to a certain area to access the next area.\n\nStory\nWarning: This story is not set on the planet Earth, its a factional planet called Hillys\n\nWhen i first started playing I didn't know what to expect when i first played but the story grabbed me about how the population was threatened by aliens called the Domz and how they attack every so often. When you first get to play you are thrown into combat stright away and the game doesn't hold your hand when it comes to showing combat, it shows a small text at the bottom showing what you press to attack but thats it, the enemy won't wait. As you play through the game you realise that the so called protectors are your enemy and the rebel organisation is actually the good guys. There is 3 dungon like places you go into to sneak around gathering infomation about what they are actually doing and exposeing them for what they do. I could go into more detail about the story but I don't want to spoil the story\n\nMusic\nEDIT: I almost forgot about the music, ill tag it here\nThe music in the game is one of the best composed soundtrack. Each track suits the time it is played, an example when the main character gets depressed and the soundtrack suits it as they use viloin as well as low notes to express the feelings. There are other times but its worth to play a demo of this game or to play the game to get the full feeling for the game.\n\nCharecters\nThere is One main character that you control called Jade, she is the reporter and also an animal documenter (as thats a main way of obtaining units which is the currency of the game) and she looks after the orphans of Hillys and she has to leave them to do her missions which sets up the plot of the game. She has two companions throughout the game.\n\nThe first one, Pey'j is her uncle who helps looking after the orphans and is also a mechanic. He doesnt stay for long as he is captured at the factory when you are finding out about what the alpha sections are doing. Pey'j has a special ability which allows him to slam onto the ground which throws up enemys to allow you to attack them and use them as projectiles. After the main plot is developed Pey'j gets a field ability where he can cut through metal fences which allows you to access areas or to get further through the main story.\n\nWhen you save Double H at the factory he joins you as the other companion throughout the rest of the game and he helps you through the remainder of the game.  Double H has a specal abilty where he uses his hammer to throw up enemys just like Pey'j but he has a field abilty where he will charge head first (helmet equipped of course) to knock down metal barred doors.\n\nWhat was the final boss like\nObviously with a title like this i shouldn't need to tell you that there will be spoliers but i'll put it here anyway.\nSPOLIER ALERT\nSPOLIER ALERT\nI have warned you. Don't complain if I spoil too much.\nThe final boss was unique as it had you thinking on your feet as you attack, he steals your uncle which leaves you with yourself and Double H, after killing the clones of your uncle Double H is taken as well and you have to fight the clones of Double H by your self and the clones keep telling you that you should give up, which isn't a option. Adventually you will be weakened as the boss says and will reverse your directional controls regardless of your settings, you can not go into the settings and change them because the game will keep them reversed, im not sure if you can go into the game with reversed directional controls and for it to be flipped. This is unique as i havent seen any other final boss do this. If your a controller user (from the ps2 or xbox 360/PS3 games) you could flip the controller itself making it slightly easier. I will not spoil how the game ends, ill leave that to you\n\nWas there anything i didn't like?\nThere wasn't much I didn't like. I loved each part of the game. I guess that the most difficult parts would be when you had a drone in the room forceing stealth as it was in a difficult room where the guards are placed in difficult spots to get pass, for example placed at the doorway you need to get out at.\n\nDo I recommend this game\nDefently as it will give you hours of fun as the main game lasts for about 7 to 8 hours without getting all the collectables, if your a completionist then it would take about 11 to 14 hours tops to get everything.","April 8, 2015","true","24.1"," 33 of 33 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","33","33","0","1"

It's a puzzle-adventurer, very akin to The Legend of Zelda. A lot of the mechanics revolve around sneaking and not being detected.\n\nYou take the role of a girl named Jade, living on a planet that's beginning to be overrun with aliens. She is hired as a reporter for a rogue organization to spy on the government, as many people think the government and the aliens are in cahoots. There are moments that'll make you cry and leave you on-edge. Jade is a great protagonist, and you'll come to love every character. The graphics are a little dated (the game was originally on PS2, GCN and Xbox, so the resolution is pretty bad and there are quite a few graphical glitches.) The game makes up for this though, with amazing soundtrack, great story and thrilling gameplay. You'll definitely feel like a spy playing this game!\nI give this game a 9/10 (if it weren't for graphical glitches and sometimes monotonous battle system, it'd definitely get a 10/10)","November 10, 2014","true","6.3"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","18","19","0","0"

Although it gained some recognition in the past five years, this game is still one of the most underappreciated sparkling gems of this century.\n\nLong version:Beyond Good & Evil was praised by both the press and players alike, yet it is still a perpetual resident on any list that collects the best rarely known games from the past 10-15 years or so.\n\nAt first glance, these ratings are difficult to justify – after all, the game is a strange hodgepodge of various genres: puzzle, platformer, stealth, 3D brawler, treasure hunt, with some driving and racing on top.\nWhile these mixed-genre games rarely work, somehow the designers managed to keep all of these elements together in a tight knot. After getting used to the controls (a controller helps), we find a game with great mechanics, astonishing levels of large variety, and a small world that constantly offers some activity between the platforming stages, but not in a distracting manner.\n\nThe final selling point is the story: we follow the adventures of Jade, a reporter and caretaker of some recently orphaned children. She gradually gets entangled in the war between her home planet and the invading aliens, only to discover the sinister truth behind the attacks, the recent kidnappings, and her own past.\nDespite the serious nature of the story, both the aesthetics and the writing tries to be light-hearted and fun, giving a great sense of adventure even when you are discussing battle plans in the back room of a bar. The cast does a wonderful job of delivering some memorable lines, elevating Beyond Good & Evil into a classic status, recommended for anyone who never had the pleasure of playing it.","February 26","true","15.7"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","2"

Only things i understood about this game was:\n\n#1. Hit evil aliens in the face\n#2. Pig man is your friend.\n#3. Take photos of animals and things\n#4. Go around in a hovercraft.. somewhere.\n\nBack then, i only visited the Hillys City and never went forward from there. I played it maybe a couple of days, then, i forgot the game for a long time. At times i heard and saw something about the game, the upcoming sequal etc. But never i decided to playthrough it, even though i was always intrigued about it.\n\nUNTIL NOW. I saw Beyond Good & Evil in steam sale under 2 euros. There, in that moment,\ni decided finally to play it through.

It's just one of those golden oldies where the story, the feel and the gameplay are more important than having the latest shiney graphics (but boring repetative gameplay and zero depth). I bought this to relive the adventure (and to kill time waiting for part 2 ;)), and for the current price on sale I can only recommend everyone to do the same.\n\nYou take on the role of reporter Jade and her trusted pig buddy Pey'J, who must fight to uncover a conspiracy of global proportions taking place on their homeplanet Hyllis. The game sports RPG-like elements, since Jade has equipement that can be upgraded by collecting a special currency, blue pearls, which are collected by defeating enemies and minigames. Although the storyline is linear, (parts of) the world can be roamed freely in between missions, giving a great sense of freedom.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/15130/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nBeyond Good and Evil is Ubisoft's under-rated-masterpiece, it was first released on the PlayStation 2 on November 11, 2003. The beautiful Music was Composed by Christophe Héral.\nBeyond Good and Evil is by far the most beautiful, outstanding game I ever played on the PS2, and when I saw it was available on Steam I exploded. There are many games that we as gamers 'play and forget'. Beyond Good and Evil is one of the games I will never forget.\n\n\n-Video Review!-\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo3HgK_4kcQ\n\n\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory: Beyond Good and Evil's Protagonist is a bright young woman named Jade. Jade is an avid martial artist, photographer and investigative reporter. She has been staying with her 'Uncle' Pay'j (A pig/boar-like biped, whom is acting as Jade's Guardian) to help take care of orphans at their lighthouse home.\nJade and Pay'j are on the mining planet “Hillys”. Hillys is under siege by an extraterrestrial group known as the “DomZ”, the DomZ are skeleton-reaper-like-aliens whom abduct and drain the life from their victims. Recently a group known as “The Alpha Sections” have taken up residence on Hillys. The Alpha Sections have sworn to defend the population of Hillys from these devastating DomZ attacks.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511832142\n\nGameplay: You play the game as Jade, in a third person camera view, the game is broken down into two modes: combat mode and stealth mode. (Side note: There is much more to the game than that, sometimes you need to take pictures, solve puzzles, figure out riddles, play mini games, and have dialogue with other NPC's.)\nWhen in combat, Jade wields a special Bo Staff known as a “Jō”; Jade preforms strikes, flips, and power attacks while in combat mode. If you were unsuccessful in sneaking past enemies you can fight your way through many parts of the game. However there is definitely an emphasis on stealth rather than fighting.\nWhen in stealth, Jade sneaks and rolls, there are oftentimes alternative paths to sneak around guards, other times you need to distract guards by creating a diversion to take them away from their posts, while you sneak past.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511832150\n\nA final note I should make, is the console to PC port wasn't quite perfect; the camera angle is sometimes a little bit awkward, but you eventually get used to the limitations and controls; Beyond Good and Evil is still very playable.\n\nAchievements: There are no achievements in the game, however there are extra things to collect while playing. You can take pictures of all the animals in the game, and collect all the pearls, and find every M-disks.\n\nPrice: Beyond Good and Evil is priced at $9.99, my first play through I unlocked everything before beating the game (I took my sweet time about it, and it took about 9-11 hours) the game can easily take anywhere from 6-8 hours to complete.\n\nWhen I was younger playing this game on the PS2; I remember that I almost beat this whole game in a day. My parrents left the house in the late morning and I started playing Beyond Good and Evil, when they got back that evening I was still playing. Needless to say, they were not pleased with my binge-playing-habits.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=511832156\n\nConclusion: Seriously, just buy and play this game.\n\n------Edits and updates------\nEdit/Update August 29, 2015:\nSpelling fix, by Angfucious.

The story is good, the gameplay is great. It's a free-roam adventure, where you explore a small world and persue the story at your own pace. This game is unpretentiously fun.\n\nYour character is a reporter investigating a grand conspiracy theme. Gameplay centers around Infiltrating government and industrial sites to capture clues and unravel the mystery. There are stealth elements, too, and occasional combat. And a sort of internal achievement system that rewards you for capturing photographs along the way of rare fauna.\n\nBG&E has the best sidekick characters since Grim Fandango, and a similar smart sense of humor.\n\nIt's a console port, but the controls are decent, despite this. I finished the game with mouse and keyboard with no difficulty. The graphics are PS2-era, but they have a distinct style of their own.

Well, thanks to Steam I finally got a chance to try the game out for cheap, and MAN IS IT AWESOME! The game has a very intriguing storyline where, as Jade, you must use your skills as a photo-journalist...or a f***king ninja... to expose a sinister government ploy. "Uncover the Conspiracy. Capture the Truth." ALL the music in the game is just beautiful...seriously...DAT F**KING PIANO. Beyond Good&Evil also has a great visual style, which totally makes up for the graphical limitations of it's time. While playing through it, I just fell in love with the game. I loved all the interesting characters and it's whimsical tone, and I was very engaged in the story. I enjoyed Beyond Good&Evil IMMENSELY and it is easily one of my favourite games of all time.

That being said, it’s a good game. The combat is really fun, controls really well(outside of the flying parts) and it’s varied enough that it never really gets boring. The story, while not super amazing, is still pretty decent. There’s a lot they could have done with it that wasn’t done and with the namesake it has I really expected more out of the story. Even though the story was underwhelming the most standout part of this game, and the most enjoyable, is definitely the 100% believable female protagonist. It’s really nice to be able to play a woman who isn’t overly sexualized or a stereotypical manly, badass female. Unlike so many other female protagonist Jade is written like she’s a real, well rounded person. More writers need to play this game so they can learn how to write realistic characters, both female and male.","February 3, 2014","true","8.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Speculations about the sequel change frequently and make it all the harder to play this game time and time again. Not because it isn't fun, but because you want more - you don't want this to be all.\n\nBG&E is a game which I could pick up and play to 100% completion any second - and I would enjoy myself. I played it first on my gamecube and when it released on Steam it was an instabuy and an instaplay. Start to finish. And there was hardly any minute, nay second in which I didn't like what the game had to offer.\n\nBefore I get to the game itself, just a little insight into my perspective towards a special kind of games (feel free to skip):\nThis game reminds me of the good ol' Rareware. Back in the 90ies and early 2000's before they sold their soul to Microsoft. Games made with love, attention to detail, heart and (and I can't believe that this is a trademark that needs to be pointed out) color. Games like Banjo-Kazooie, Conkers Bad Fur Day and weirdly enough this Ubisoft-Game stick out to me not just gameplay-wise, but also visually. They are bright where they need to be and dark when it is necessary - but they always ooze charme and liveliness. And to be fair - in its catalog of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and unpolished games, Ubisoft does have some amazing titles - Child of Light and Rayman come to mind. All these aforementioned games fall into a special kind of category for me. They all feel different and distinct from each other, but still weirdly similar. They all share the high quality anyways. But hey, maybe that is just me.\n\nAbout BG&E itself:\nBeyond good and evil is an action adventure mix without any outstanding design decisions, but everything that is in the game, is very well implemented, while still being kinda basic. There is a simple combat system, which doesn't reach the levels of a spectacle fighter - reminiscent of Starfox Adventures. There is a stealth system, but it isn't as deep as the likes of Metal Gear, Splinter Cell or Thief. There is some sense of Open-World-Exploration, but please don't expect GTA or Skyrim. There is photography, but (sadly) no Prof. Oak to evaluate your skills regarding capturing Snorlax' butt on polaroid. And there are racing-sequences, which...well they are rather tight actually - I lik'em.\n\nThis game gives you a bit of everything in bitesized chunks and delivers a quite well presented story on the side. It is vast, but not intimidating. You can actually complete it 100% without doing a lot of unnecessary walking and searching - yet it feels rewarding. IMHO this is a game that you need to play to experience its appeal firsthand. Don't read about it, don't watch a Let's play - play it. It is really well polished, casts some memorable characters and, apart from the overall length of the game, does not leave much to be desired.","January 26","true","10.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It looks rather kiddy at first, but deals with some dark themes and plotlines, and also is rather frustratingly difficult at times. In many ways the definition of an award-winning flop, it's got a quirky style to it that you may or may not be on board with. Gameplay consists of platforming (which is solid), combat (which is bland), stealth (which is fun but frustrating), and driving/shooting (which is unpleasant). Nothing in the gameplay really stands out as exceptional, but the world and story are well-realized, even if the plot is sometimes overdramatic.\n\nFlawed, but charming and memorable. It's goofy and creative in its best moments, awkward and sloppy at its worst. There's a lot to like and enjoy, but plenty of moments that left me scratching my head. Difficulty was all over the place, with tricky parts not helped by the camera, but most of it was on the easier side. Despite what it has going against it, the quirkiness and setting were more than enough to drive my curiosity to the ending.\n\nI experienced some minor technical issues on windows 8.1, mostly just flickering textures, and a crash or two, but I didn't consider them enough of a bother to stop me from playing.

You could also work around the controller issue by mapping the buttons using a 3rd party software such as JoyToKey, but you can't make it analogue though. I played this on keyboard and mouse due to that limitation and it's not bad, I just would've liked to play on the couch in Big Picture mode.\n\nApart from those technical issues I could say that everything else about the game is good. The story and the characters are likeable and well-written. I particularly liked Uncle Pey'j, who is probably now one of my favourite sidekick characters in all games. Voice acting was pretty much spot on for each character, maybe little on a campy side with different accents and all that, but as long as it fits.. Same could be said about the music.\n\nI was a little worried that the early 2000s 3D graphics haven't aged well, but luckily my worries were in vain: Especially character movement and facial animations have stood the test of time and overall the game is still a pleasure to look at.\n\nI wasn't really a fan of the face to face combat sequences, which occasionally just turned into mashing fests with little to no idea which enemy I was targeting. Your character, Jade, also locks into enemies which can make her a bit hard to control in combat. Stealth sections were a nice change of pace though, and I didn't have too much trouble with the camera that seems to have been an issue for others.\n\nSolid fun for 10+ hours.

But hey, that's fine, because an excuse to promote this game is welcome.\n\nDon't be fooled by the somewhat retro graphics... this is a near perfect game.  It's a mixture of combat and steatlh, both quite satisfying.  The stealth elements are really good... you have to sneak past soldiers, though if your timing is good you can fight them or incapacitate them.  The situations get harder as you go; they can be quite tense.\n\nPlus there's, well, all kinds of stuff along the way: a chase scene, hovercraft battles and races, air hockey, photography.  None of these feel like "mini-games" (except maybe the air hocky, but it's fun)-- they add variety without taking you out of the game.\n\nPlus Jade is cute.\n\nGo buy it so they keep working on the sequel.","December 18, 2010","true","42.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

She can also gain a number of items and weapons that are integral to advancing and a lot of fun to wield.

I preordered it when nintendo power bragged about it. Was never regretting that one. This game is deep, and I mean DEEP. One of the first great conspiracy stories in video games, expertly told with an underground, veneer peeling vibe. Not to give anything away, but the light and colorful starting world goes far beyond itself, showing how everything truly is. As philosophical as the title book was (Nietzche, don't get much more philosophical!), this story hits pretty close.\nBut for you gameplay oriented people out there, this game is still good. It takes a bit of time to get used to antiquated controls and glitches, as this game was FAR smaller than most modern ones, but it created many of the engines later used. The camera support is very nice, the combat is fairly set up (but simple), but the majority of the game relies on caring about the world and the story, so if you like a good tale? Play this game.

The characters are surprisingly well-written. Jade, the game's protagonist, is notable as much for what she is as what she isn't. Jade is one of the few female leads that isn't overlty sexualized, often a problematic of video game writting. Rather, she is intelligent, strong, compassionate and unpretentious, a true everyman. In terms of gameplay, Beyond Good & Evil is a blend of action, adventure and stealth.

You sift through greyishrocks, and then you find a game so touching, and so chock full of variety you wonder why you were so lucky as to have found it.\nI will not go into detail on the story, the gameplay, as words cannot describe what a uplifting and amazing game BG&E is. Seriously this review is done. Buy it already.\n10/10","July 29, 2012","true","6.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Beyond Good and Evil is an action adventure game that I think everyone should play.  The PC version is probably the worst version, in my opinion, but even with that it is still worth buying.  The graphics hold up surprisingly well and look great.  Don't let the colorful graphics fool you though, the story is surprisingly mature.\n\nThe game has awesome/likable characters, a good story, a strong female lead who isn't over sexualized, the list goes on.  It isn't perfect though, especially not this version.  The game begs to be played with a controller, there are invisible walls all over the place which can be annoying sometimes and there are some bugs not in the console versions like the flickering graphics bug.\n\nOverall, this is a criminally underrated/underappreciated game that I think everyone should play.\n\nA-","December 23, 2013","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The gameplay is varied and exciting, the characters and world are wonderfully crafted, the plot is satisfying, and the music is profound. But it's greater than the sum of its parts, and most importantly, you truly care about what happens. The character development and writing are some of the best and most indelible in recent memory. Its exquisite mix of the whimsical and the sincere results in something beautiful and memorable. Highly, highly recommended.","June 23, 2011","true",""," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The cover art was intriguing, and the basic description caught my attention. However, the first few times I tried to play the game, I could not get through it because I did not have the patience to solve some of the challenges. Then one day in college, I picked it up over a weekend, deciding to play for the heck of it and to finish it once and for all.\n\nAm I glad I did.\n\nThe game immerses you in the story from the get-go, forgoing the typical long, drawn-out backstory. The characters are warm and engaging, and all of them, major and minor, are full of depth and life. This is the only game that can honestly make me say I was sad to leave the world when I completed it, and it is the only game I can pick up once every few months and play again, even though I already know the answers to all of the puzzles and where to find all of the hidden items. So imagine my heartbreak when my PS2 copy started to glitch each time I started a new file, and my joy finding that it is available on Steam for only ten dollars!\n\nThis game was well-thought out and developed, and I can say without a doubt that it is my favorite game. I am proud to own both the original PS2 copy and now to own it on Steam.","October 15, 2013","true","5.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It still looks great for a game over a decade old, the soundtrack is fantastic, the characters have a ton of personality, good voice acting, and the story is pretty engaging. The gameplay is really solid and has quite a bit of variation between combat, stealth, exploration, racing, minigames, etc. You'll probably only get 8-10 hours out of a playthrough but personally I prefer a short, focused game to one that it padded with 20 hours of tedious repetition.

Never managed to finish it back then, cue to my computer crashing. The new one couldn't handle the disc..\n\nBut now, steam has it, and I finally got to finishing it.\nGreat story, great gameplay, has some stealth, racing, photographing, good dungeons, puzzle solving, amongst other things. It has some camera issues though, you might get annoyed by the fact that the camera is a bit hard to handle sometimes.\n\nOverall, I've had a great experience. The story and characters are all great and well-made, and the gameplay is well done although you might think "photographing as a gameplay element, what?"\nIt is a bit shorter than many modern day games though, since back then you couldn't fit all that much onto a disc so it couldn't grow as massive as it wanted. (what I mean is, don't expect a 20 hour long odyssey from this, I got through the whole game in just 7 hours).\n\nFor those who may be wondering, this game does not have multiplayer, it is singleplayer only. Meaning no versus, co-op or other such things.\n\nHowever, it is a bit poorly ported to the newer OS-versions, meaning that it will probably not be fully functional straight-off. Graphical and sound issues are the most common problems, and for some users it doesn't even start. However, ti did start for me, and the graphics bugs I fixed by turning off "HW vertex processing" in the advanced settings of the game's startup menu. The sound issue I've heard is related to multi-core, and mostly fixed by telling the game to use only one core. Still, I would recommend that you turn on subtitles, just in case. (it doesn't always work flawlessly with the voice, occasionally some pieces have been known to disappear..)\n\nStill, though, a really great game.\nTo summarise, you should really consider buying this straight up, right now, if you don't mind a few problems, many which are quite easily fixed for some people.\n\nOf course, since these bugs vary from player to player I cannot know which ones you are going to have (for me only the graphical issues, along with some occasional missing sound in dialogue or music, were present. The repeating voice bug, was not) so therefore I will not take these bugs into consideration when rating this.\n\nIf I disregard the problems that arrived when getting this to newer OS, this would get a solid 9/10 from me.","February 23, 2014","true","47.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I got a second hand PS2 for my birthday, and my parents let me choose one game with it. I was totally new to video games and I had no idea which game I should choose, so I just let the store owner recommend me a game. And so Beyond Good and Evil it was. Luckily the game was in Dutch (my native language). I was around 10 years old back then, and I couldn't understand English. I started playing the game, not knowing what to expect at all. I remember that the game made a lot of impact on me. Of course, this could be because of the fact that this was my first game ever, but eight years later I can tell you that it wasn't just because of that. It was because of the astonishing music, the amazing atmosphere, and the feeling I got when I figured out how to complete a part of the game all by myself, after looking for a walkthrough on the internet. So now it's eight years later, I've probably completed over a hundred other games, great ones too, but Beyond Good and Evil always had a special place in my heart. I've replayed this game over 20 times, and a couple of days ago I bought the PC version too.

You need to fiddle with the game quite a bit just to run it on a modern PC. Cutscene sound is badly out of sync and I've only managed to partially reduce the issue by limiting the game to one CPU core and running external applications to launch the game. You will also need to disable HW Vertex Processing in advanced graphics options to get rid of the flicker. It also seems that gamepads are not supported, but the M&K layout works just fine, though it's not entirely intuitive.\n\nThe game itself feels very dates and doesn't seem to have aged well. The plot is ok, but not very fleshed out. A classic story of a protagonist with exceptional powers, the nature of which is only slightly hinted at at the end of the game itself. The world doesn't feel real.\n\nThe controls are clunky, Combat mechanics are pretty bad. It's mostly a game about sneaking with combat being an annoying afterthought, until you get to fight the final boss.\n\nOn the bright side, the checkpoints are reliably placed all over the place and you never have to backtrace to much.\n\nAs a whole, I would recommend to watch the plot summary on YouTube and play something much more mechanically enjoyable.","March 14","false","0.8"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","9","19","0","0"

The game is good in terms of plot, but once again, like Deep Space, I cannot give a thumbs up due to the controls on PC keyboard.  It became obvious that this is a controller game based on the way the character loses behind the shoulder pov and goes to side scroller type, making it extremely difficult to get the main character to perform as you want.  It doesn't mean it's impossible, it's merely frustrating as heck and required repeated plays in areas due to deaths that had nothing to do with fights.  I had to play the game in short bursts rather than enjoy it in consecutive sittings.  So you are warned about the controls before you choose to purchase the game to play with a PC Keyboard.\n\nPros:\n-Story\n-Length\n-Music\n-Jamaican Rhinos\n\nCons:\n-Keyboard controls\n-Changing camera pov\n-Last boss fight with reverse controls and never-ending repeated hitting in a pattern (I clocked 31 times in a row with no effect before throwing in the towel.  If I happened to have had 99 K-lives as suggested before going into the final battle, maybe I would eventually have seen the end).","March 5","false","14.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/recommended/15130/","Lintire","Lintire","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lintire/","194 products in account","Beyond Good and Evil is a 2003 Stealth Action-Adventure game developed by Ubisoft Montpellier, the studio behind the Rayman series and also responsible for original titles like From Dust. Montpellier, as a creative powerhouse, delivered Beyond Good and Evil to critical acclaim, but devastatingly poor sales have infamously seen the sequel perpetually delayed.\n\nThis is a horrible port, and you should not buy it.\n\nBeyond Good and Evil is not a perfect game. This is the only version of it I've played, so my experience is not all encompassing. However, I felt that most, if not all, of the problem with the game stemmed from what a horrendous port this is.\n\nIt controls absolutely awful, because for a game that is designed solely for gamepads, it dictates that you use the keyboard and mouse. Trying to steer Jade while clicking away in haphazard combos isn't fun at all, along with common mishaps like sticking to walls and desperately waggling the mouse in radial-based menus like an idiot.\n\nThere is no gamepad support for this game whatsoever, outside of using a clunky 3rd-party program like Xpadder. So that means when the game restricts you camera to a 2D plane, you just have to deal with it. When it decides to wrench your camera away for you for no apparent reason, you just have to deal with it. When you're desperately wrenching the mouse while janking the hovercraft with the WASD keys to get it around corners, you just have to deal with it.\n\nThose are just the control issues. Even after disabling a certain amount of options to get the game running at above a powerpoint rate (note: simply lowering the settings made the game perform even worse) I had constant plummets in framerate and constant graphical glitches. This port (not by Montpellier) makes Ubisoft's recent debacles look good.\n\nIt is, however, a decent game. The gameplay is shallow, and the amount of distractions in the disappointingly small hub-world one-note, but the game is carried by the amazing art style and music. The art style speaks for itself, and the music is worth tracking down if you can. While not sold on the game's cult classic status, the game is a solid casual Action Adventure that doesn't demand much in the way of attention and delivers on the premise plenty.\n\nI'm not recommending this, not because you shouldn't play this, but because you shouldn't play this version. Play the HD version, emulate a console version, by Jove even dig out a sixth gen system and track down a physical copy if you're truly dedicated to playing this game and seeing what the hype is all about.\n\nPlaying the Steam version of Beyond Good and Evil will only sour you on an already hard to sell game.","August 10, 2015","false","11.7"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Please read all of it before bashing it though. It seems like everybody and their mother claims this game to be one of the best and beg for a sequel. I disagree. I only finished the game for the first time, never played it before. Maybe if I played it when younger I'd have some nostalgic factor or something, but that wouldn't actually mean the game is good... because the game is just not that good.\n\nThe game, first off, is really, really simple, which isn't something I mean negatively. There's many simple modern games I enjoy, like Fable, so that isn't a bad point. The problem is that all of the simple "pieces" don't really work as expected. Before getting into the game, just a quick brush on graphics and such, though those don't really sway my opinion of a game. The graphics weren't bad, rough in places, but overall pretty decent for years back. The sound, on the other hand, was only okay. People seem to love the soundtrack, but all in all it was pretty average and had nothing exciting.\n\nThe only song that stood out to me was out on the sea early in the game, the peaceful one reused at the beginning of the credits. It was really nice and I loved that one. Besides songs, the dialogue was decent. Audio sync didn't really cause many problems for me, only once or twice.\n\nNow, onto the game. The characters were all lackluster. I didn't really care about any of them, even the kids. The only one I liked was Pey'j. Jade didn't really stand out as a special protagonist, though I did feel a little twinge at a couple places near the end (mostly due to Pey'j). The kids were really only used at the beginning and end... and the same goes for Secundo. And Double H was sooooooo annoying. I really, really hated him. His voice and style was the most generically annoying possible.\n\nWhen it came to the NPCs in terms of gameplay, it was a waste. They served virtually no purpose other than to move around a couple puzzles and to bash their special ability during combat. But they served to make combat more annoying. They just stood around, got attacked, and got pinned to the ground. I wanted to give them PA-1's, but I needed the health usually! Friendly fire made it worse, because they just stood in my way and often I would take off half a heart because they'd get hit.\n\nBoss fights weren't good except for the final two bosses. All of the others were so simple and easy that I beat them all in less than 90 seconds each, some even less than 1 minute, because most of them were usually bashing the same pattern without thought. The first boss you could even beat without being touched, and without any effort.\n\nThe controls in the game were pretty wobbly, usually because of the camera, which would bounce around. In most of the levels, the confines were relatively cramped, so the camera bounced all over for me. I'd be seeing through walls or the ground, and could barely keep things focused. If you walk near certain walls, the camera would jump 180 degrees, so during combat, it was even more terrible. I'd often end up hitting random things or thin air.\n\nStealth wasn't that special. It was semi-enjoyable, but in some places the controls and camera made it worse. In one level (I think the Slaughterhouse? Or the one before it), there was sneaking through a foggy area, but it took me several tries to get through. It was really simple in idea, but my camera got stuck and I was always looking into the ground and at Zoey, all in the fog, so I could see nothing. It kept moving even if I centered the camera, so I could barely see the enemies. Other places were relatively annoying too, and all in all it just wasn't that fun or special.\n\nThe story was pretty generic, really. Oh no, people are betrayed and getting abducted by aliens? That's pretty much all it amounted to the entire game, except for the last 5 minutes. But because I lost interest by that point, the last 5 minutes of revealings didn't make me care any more or want a sequel. The aspect of using a camera as a special spy was interesting at first, but everything was generally repetitive, so nothing special.\n\nLastly, exploration was a bummer. I expected there to be a bit more to the world. I didn't expect something crazy... but there really wasn't much at all. The 4 races, meh. The 4 looter's caverns, meh. I mean, I did them all, and they were okay, but not much else opened up in the world as the game progressed. Only a couple more dungeon-like areas, but most were short.\n\nAnd the biggest annoying part of that... the city. I really, really liked the looks of the city going into it at first. I expected it to open up more throughout the game and was excited about it. You get a city pass and I thought, finally! But you move like 50 more feet and hit another wall. So basically, for a decently-sized city, you get to explore none of it. They could have really made it bigger. A few alleys was really disappointing.\n\nAnyway, everything culminated into a disappointment. I'm not complaining because of overhyping; I'm just stating that the game was generally flawed in almost all of its aspects. I have absolutely no desire to replay it, while there are many other games I have replayed or will replay through the years.","January 13, 2015","false","14.3"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

If your GFX card is younger than 10 years, or you have more than one cpu core (including HT) expect lots of problems; such as slowdowns, texture glitches, and the sound being out of sync with the action/video.\n\nThere are lots of posts about this easily found with google. Two solutions often come up that help a little: 1) set CPU affinity to just one CPU core (done with taskman), 2) Set GFX features to manual and turn most things off (google for specifics). oh and you will never be able to get rid of the warning about your GFX drivers being too old.\n\nSteam does not know how many hours I've played because I start the game outside of steam with a .bat script, that tries to adjust some things for the game.

I really enjoyed it. The story, music, and world were a joy to experience and it's nice to play a game with the early aughts levity that you so seldom get in current games.\n\nNow, would I recommend this for the PC? ....Not necessarily, it is horribly ported. Every time I launched the game it said my graphics card drivers were out of date (they weren't) Apparently, if you run this on a newer machine, the game can't recognize your graphics card and will just pop that error up every time you launch. You can click through it to boot the game up, though. Before you do that, I would suggest going into the advanced settings (not ingame), going into the manual compatibility settings and disabling HW Vertex Processing: it's job is to bug your game out with random polygons and artifacts that make the game unplayable. From what I've read, this happens to a lot of people.\n\nAnother problem with the port, this game was designed for a controller, yet there's no controller support. If you're like me, you're going to need to faff about extensively with the control settings to get the game marginally comfortable to play. One thing that I couldn't fix was how both the mouse and WSAD keys sent the same commands when you're in a vehicle and it screws with the camera. All in all, while I got through the game fine enough, it felt like I was limping the whole way because of the poor controls.\n\nThe game itself, though, was wonderful. As I took in the music, characters, and setting of the game I was sad that this never got the trilogy it promised to be. It's got a little of everything in it, stealth, action, vehicles, mini-games, puzzles, NPC interaction; its really remarkable that all of this was in it way back in the early 2000's and I felt the experience actually aged quite well. The lightly cartoony look did the game well and avoided the "super realistic" games pitfal of looking and playing like ♥♥♥ now.

Featuring a sprawling explorable world and cartoony graphics, the game combines standard action-adventure mechanics with bits of  Metal Gear, Prince of Persia, and even a little Pokemon Snap. Combat is fairly bland, but the focus seems to be more on creating a cinematic experience than worrying too much about gameplay mechanics... and yet the voice-acting is wonky, character development is paper-thin, and the 3rd-person camera tends to be a bit stubborn. You occasionally get the feeling that Ubisoft Montpellier spread itself a little too thin on this one, but the game is over before anything really gets tedious.

The game's story is amazing backed up by emotional moments, compeiling characters, and the need to find out just who is really orchestrating the DomZ attacks and who is kidnapping the citizens of Hillys.  Furthermore is the graphics, I don't tend to focus on graphics much, but, Beyond Good and Evil deserves for its graphics to be praised for a world that draws you into it beauty and to this day has aged quite well.  And the music fits every mood rather it be a tough boss battle or sad cutscene.  Gameplay is also solid--Jade's movements in battle always feel smooth and well executed.  Perhaps the most interesting thing I thought about the gameplay was how it combined not just the action adventure of a Zelda game, but the stealth you would find in such as Metal Gear.  Now there are some issues with this game I should address but shouldn't stop you from playing the game.  One, is that the game has not been optimized for modern day pcs, in fact as soon as you start the game you are given an error that your 'Graphics Card' has not been updated to the latest version, but at least you can still play it.  Then theres problems with sometimes flickering graphics and such, and one of the worst that ruined a very important scene in the game near the end was at the middle of the cutscene the sound absolutely stopped (I had to reload an earlier save, turn on subtitles and go through it again just to hear them).  In other words this game is a straight out port of the pc version that has not been optimized for modern day pcs.  But even though it has issues with modern day pcs I found that it was still enjoyable as it was back when it was released.  I suggest Ubisoft releases a patch so that Beyond Good and Evil can run on modern day pcs better, much better.  If you can deal with the issues then you will certainly have a blast playing this overlooked great game.  However if you don't want to deal with the issues then I suggest you buy the HD version on Xbox 360 or PS3.\n","December 30, 2013","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I never played this game before, yet it felt like I was right back in the Ps1-Ps2 era of console gaming. This game does have a lot to it, and one of the really great things about this game that stands out almost right away is the soundtrack.\nThe combat system in this game is really fun, but it doesn't expand as much as it should of. I only found one Attack powerup, but maybe I missed a hidden one somewhere.\n\nThe game is still challenging at parts.\nThe only downside I had with the game was learning the hard way that there is no Autosave.

The game's story is amazing backed up by emotional moments, compeiling characters, and the need to find out just who is really orchestrating the DomZ attacks and who is kidnapping the citizens of Hillys.  Furthermore is the graphics, I don't tend to focus on graphics much, but, Beyond Good and Evil deserves for its graphics to be praised for a world that draws you into it beauty and to this day has aged quite well.  And the music fits every mood rather it be a tough boss battle or sad cutscene.  Gameplay is also solid--Jade's movements in battle always feel smooth and well executed.  Perhaps the most interesting thing I thought about the gameplay was how it combined not just the action adventure of a Zelda game, but the stealth you would find in such as Metal Gear.  Now there are some issues with this game I should address but shouldn't stop you from playing the game.  One, is that the game has not been optimized for modern day pcs, in fact as soon as you start the game you are given an error that your 'Graphics Card' has not been updated to the latest version, but at least you can still play it.  Then theres problems with sometimes flickering graphics and such, and one of the worst that ruined a very important scene in the game near the end was at the middle of the cutscene the sound absolutely stopped (I had to reload an earlier save, turn on subtitles and go through it again just to hear them).  In other words this game is a straight out port of the pc version that has not been optimized for modern day pcs.  But even though it has issues with modern day pcs I found that it was still enjoyable as it was back when it was released.  I suggest Ubisoft releases a patch so that Beyond Good and Evil can run on modern day pcs better, much better.  If you can deal with the issues then you will certainly have a blast playing this overlooked great game.  However if you don't want to deal with the issues then I suggest you buy the HD version on Xbox 360 or PS3.\n","December 30, 2013","true","11.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

None is extremly polished or hard but they all work well togheter without interrupting the flow of the game (something many modern games seem to have forgotten). The reporter theme is refreshing.

However, you can really feel a Zelda-like gameplay in a environment that is big enough to provide a sensation of "world" more than "guided map".

Platforming, stealth and combat are basic but satisfying, and what it lacks mechanically, it makes up for in content and character. Looks lovely even without the HD textures, boasts one of the all-time great orchestral soundtracks, a wealth of entertaining side-quests and mini-games, and the best photography mechanic since Pokemon Snap.\n\nAs an early 2000s port though, you'll need a lot of patience. From the menus right through to core gameplay and boss battles it's clearly geared for a gamepad, yet doesn't natively support one. I'd recommend trying Xpadder as a keyboard and mouse are frustrating at best, and in the case of the game camera, almost unuseable. Better yet, get the HD re-release from the PS3 or 360 markets.","February 16, 2014","true","12.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really, really wanted to give a try to one of the (as i heard) most underrated games in existance. But here's the deal.\n\n\nWhile gameplay and story wise is solid enough and aged decently, the main issue comes from being a terrible port. From custom settings not working to random flickering, to even ignoring any community fixes for some reason. This also includes ignoring control configuration, which is a big deal SPECIALLY on driving sections (And some areas require a lot of precission). The game isn't clearly designed for keyboard controls, and once you get in your vehicle you'll realize.\n\nI'll recommend this game.

Honestly you'll be saving to avoid the game crashing and losing progress as apposed to losing a fight. Dying in any room or fight usually just places you right before the encounter.\n\n- the most fighting you'll be doing in this game is against the camera. It's wonky, doesn't reset most of the time, and snaps you into awkward angles.\n- bugs. Jesus. This game is riddled with bugs. Sometimes its the AI partner freaking out but other times its more devious bugs like "ran out of memory" and you having to restart the game.\n- texture issues a plenty. I couldn't get the launcher to readjust and show me settings, so I had to live with my initial settings which had textures going bonkers throughout the whole game.\n- the cliffhanger...\n\nAll in all it's something I think everyone should check out.

Though arguably not as purely entertaining as that more popular predecessor, Beyond Good and Evil is a gem.\nRather than one gameplay mechanic that develops through the game, Beyond has several that stay within their simple controls for the game's entirety (pod racing, stealth, style-over-substance combat, etc). In spite of this party-box mentality, none of these segments feel dated or become tired, and serve up some genuine challenge and suspense as the game develops. The story is similarly easy-going, but is carried by memorably colourful characters, making the game's rare darker moments all the more affecting.\nOf course, it does have the hallmarks/clichés (depending on who you ask) of a PS2 game, and the city hub loses some of the life it once had with the passing years. Non-interactive characters in games have always been an awkward stumbling block (the ever-repeating lines, the passive stares, their jarring inferior animation), and Beyond is a case in point. A last-act collect-a-thon entry requirement that prevents you from reaching the climax is an eye-rolling sign of age, and the fact that it appears after what's easily the game's most powerful moment makes it's appearance all the more unwelcome. Actually carrying out this task, however, is an enjoyable showcase for the game's mechanical variety, and the open-world's now-quaint size is packed with interesting sights and exciting gameplay, which is always more important than sheer mileage.\nI'm not yet ready to load my belongings onto the "Bring BGAE 2" bandwagon just yet, but this is an excellent opener to an unfinished trilogy, holding up very well for a commercial disaster from 13 years ago.","March 18","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And 5$! That should be a convincing argument.\nYou get a lot of good game for every dollar you spent.\nWhat do they say about old stuff? Old but gold.

Just first hour in and I was surprised. I just don't like the fact that they will throw the plot at you at the very beginning in a very short narrative, but that's just me. :D This is the first time I'll be playing it, I hope there's more to this.","May 9","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Actually, there’s been a long time a game had not glued me behind my pc like this one. Although this may be true that some elements definitely make you notice it’s not a recent game, if you manage to ignore those elements, it’s somehow quite an entertaining experience. This game is well worth its price.","May 31","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
