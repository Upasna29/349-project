Hopefully Konami shall at least grace Steam with Harmony of Despair if the sales do well.\n\nLords of Shadow - Mirror of Fate is a great blend of the classic Castlevania mixed with the later Metroidvania exploration, all wrapped in a solid combat system.\n\nThe Pros:\n- Great atmosphere\n-Great art and music\n-Combat is fluid and rewarding\n-The pacing is pretty good.\n-Character designs and animations are pretty damn awesome.\n-Doesn't have all the QTE's breaking up combat. There are a few, but not as many as on the DS version.\n-Alucard with a whip, need I say more?\n\nThe Cons:\n-Sometimes suffers brief slowdowns when entering a new area, even with a top-notch gaming rig.\n-Hit registration and enemy invicibility frames can be really random and wonky.\n-The various character's combat styles aren't very unique aside from spells and subweapons.\n-As in classic Castlevania style: Expect plenty of B.S. deaths, so your patience may be tried.\n-Blocking system is good but needs reworking, not enough reward for timing a perfect block.\n-The controls are awkward at first and take getting used to. It is strictly keyboard, and doesn't offer much customization.\n\nOverall it is definitely worth a buy if you like 2.5D action platformers. The art is fantastic, and the combat has weight to it. Most of the flaws can be easily circumvented and the pros definitely outweigh the cons. Hopefully this isn't the last time Steam picks up another Castlevania.","March 29, 2014","true","5.7"," 59 of 68 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","59","68","0","3"

Whether you are a new or old player, this game is nothing short of a blast! The story is intriuging, the combat fun, and the graphics are brilliant (for being a 3DS Port)! I enjoyed how the gameplay consisted mostly of exploration and the very layed back atmosphere made it more enjoyable than stressful and overly intense.\n\nThis game in particular gives great nods to the past with certain key rooms and areas that remind me of the older games: something I really appreciated. Although Castlevania has had a facelift, the series is still thriving!\n\nNo matter who plays Mirror of Fate, I assure you that this title is an instant classic to be enjoyed for years to come!","October 31, 2014","true","18.7"," 31 of 34 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","31","34","0","0"

Castlevania: LOS - MOF has a great old school feel and does everything right.  The controls and combat are tight and satisfying.  Some of the boss battles (and also some of the "fodder" battles) you get a great feeling from victory.\n\nCheckpoints are located in good locations so as not to make the game too easy and also not to create massive frustrations.  There is very little back-tracking, mostly throughout the game you feel as if you are progressing.\n\nThe graphics are weirdly great.  During my playthrough I took a load of screenshots.  When looking through them afterwards they don't looks so great.  You can easily see some of the low-res textures used in the backgrounds and some of the polygons are very obvious.  The weird thing is whilst playing, the game looks so nice!  I attribute this to great graphics artistry and also there is a wonderful use of colours as you move through the game.  In some areas as you move through your environment the colours subtley change, it really is very nice!\n\nI'm personally not one for stories but I watched a little of the cutscenes which are beautifully drawn and animated.  I may go back and watch them in sequence in the library one time.\n\nI'd heartily recommend this Castlevania for anyone interested in this genre.","August 13, 2015","true","17.7"," 40 of 50 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","40","50","2","0"

It's actually pretty linear and any exploration you want to do with your new powers is completely optional.

It embodied everything i like about an action game. It had massive enemy variety, exploration, puzzles, challenge and story. The second chapter in the LoS series Mirror of Fate tries its best to maintain that original blueprint and succeeds while channeling its classic Castlevania roots while suffering graphically due to its original development being completed on the 3DS.\n\nMirror of Fate tells the tales of Simon, Trevor, and Alucard after the events of LoS. The story is broken into 3 acts where you will take control of one of the said characters but all the stories are actually intertwined. As an example if playing as Simon you may receive help from Alucard. In the second act playing as Alucard, you will find out why and how you helped Simon. This keeps the story interesting but too many hints are thrown around for a surprise ending like LoS. Overall the story is still good and best of all it feels like a Castlevania game.\n\nOne of the best things i like about the 3 characters setup  is the variety that each brings to each act. As you level you will unlock attacks which every character will use, but the differences are just minor movement or special abilities for each that keeps combat and exploration fresh throughout the game. As Simon you can carry axes and flasks of oil to set enemies on fire and he also channels the ability of a spirit who can be used as a shield, or a spirit of an archer who will attack when enemies are in range. As Alucard he can slow time, change into a wolf to climb certain walls and do more damage, but he can also turn himself into a mist and he has wings to jump higher. When playing as Trevor he carries boomerangs and electric shock grenades and his special abilities are using light magic which can regain health from attacks, or shadow magic which increase damage. This variety is one of the game's strengths as each act felt like a new game.\n\nCertain expectations come with a game bearing the name Castlevania and thats combat, bosses and exploration. I loved looking for secrets and exploring the castle and most of all when they are important as you will need each and every upgrade in order to defeat the bosses.Though the setting for Mirror of fate does not change drastically for each of the 3 acts, each individual character you play will approach each section differently making each act its own. The changes come with the enemy types and abilities your characters will learn. Most of the first act involves combat, the second introduces some puzzles and the third act most bosses, excluding the end, are done with QTE’s and there is also more platforming.\n\nEnemy variety and challenge continue to also evolve as you make your way thru the game. I never found the regular enemies outside a few challenging(damn puppets) but they will all keep you on your toes. In order to increase difficulty a lot of games will overwhelm you with numbers which then forces you into basic button mashing but Mirror of Fate avoids this trap. Instead it throws a small number at you and lets you use your skills you have learned more strategically. This makes the enemy encounters more of a dance than the normal chaotic hit x,x,x,x,x. Just as in the original LoS i was constantly looking at my abilities and bestiary for my best attack combos. This made combat super satisfying, fun and never frustrating.\n\nJust as everything else the bosses in Mirror of Fate come at you with a ton of variety and higher challenge. They all follow the rule of three and none seem to be unique(historically) but beating each was still super satisfying and of course beating Dracula had my hands sweating. I always am amused when the first boss, to me, was not only the hardest but the most unique of all the boss fights. Also if i kept track, when i did finish a boss i barely had any health left making for very tense encounters. One thing i did like a lot was the game allows you to leave a boss fight in case you feel overwhelmed and need to go level.\n\nUsually when i come to summoning up the negatives i have a few to list but in this case for Mirror of Fate the only negative to me was the graphics. While this was a HD version of the original 3DS release it still suffers from minimal colors, flat textures and it's basically just an upscale in resolution from the original. That being said, the framerate is solid, combat is fast and furious and it still looks ok. It just made me want a 2D Castlevania MADE for the PC.\n\nMirror of Fate maybe one of the best 2D action games i have ever played. It never was boring, or frustrating and its variety kept it fresh throughout the 18 hours i spent attacking, jumping, swinging, searching and leveling. An excellent adventure for a fan of the series or genre would enjoy.\n\nPositives\n\nCombat is excellent and satisfying\nThe enemy and character variety\nChallenging but fair Boss fights\nIntertwined story\nLengthy campaign\n100% completion reward\n\nNegatives\n\nThis is a port of the 3DS version which limits it graphically\nBacktracking can become a little annoying\n\nSide notes:\n\nI completed the game on my desktop PC with an Xbox 360 controller where i never had any problems. The game ran super smooth with a fast frame rate.\nI finished the game on Hard difficulty with 100% completion for the entire campaign. It took me 18hrs and i would say 2 hours was when i was lost or backtracking too many times looking for secrets.\n","November 13, 2015","true","21.3"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","22","28","0","1"

Because he's a  pain in the neck!\n\n+ great story\n+ great music, passable voicework\n+ fun, varied combat\n+ plenty of combos and abilities to obtain\n+ diverse enemies and bosses\n\n- controls somewhat imprecise (see next bullet point)\n- sluggish animations\n- graphics a little sub-standard (but this is a 3DS port)\n\nOverall, this game is quite enjoyable.  The story is told in 3 acts from 3 different characters' perspectives.  It's an entertaining plot and I liked the new twists on the old characters and backstories.  Combat is fun, exploration is rewarded, and bosses do a good job of keeping you on your toes.\n\nThe only real problem I had is that the animations, and therefore the controls, feel a little slow and clunky.  This is due to the fact that it uses 3D models with 2D gameplay.  Once you get used to it though, it becomes little more than a minor nuisance.  Also, even though it's HD (and it does look much better than the original) Mirror of Fate is a port of a portable game so the graphics will be uglier than most other modern 3D games.","January 25, 2015","true","9.8"," 21 of 27 people (78%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","78","21","27","12","0"

Gameplay wise, it differs alot from the first Lords of Shadow, instead of being a spectacle fighter, Mirror of Fate is a metroidvania in the strict sense of the word. That said, please be aware that the only games of the Castlevania series that I’ve played were Lords of Shadows and this one.\n\nAt its core it is an action adventure platformer in which you’ll find yourself backtracking to previous areas that you couldn’t previously access, and now you can because you have a certain ability or skill. The game is somewhat linear but there is alot of room for exploration which most often the not, rewards you with either more health, more magic, more ammunition or scrolls, which contain the last thoughs of fallen Brotherhood of Light soldiers.\n\nThe game takes place after the events of the previous game and lets you take control of Simon Belmont, Alucard and Trevor Belmont. The game is divided into three different acts and in each act you’ll play a different character, each one of them having their unique special abilities and weapons. There is some puzzle solving on the game, mostly on the second act and it is pretty good. It isn’t too hard nor too easy and this is coming from someone who tends to stay away from puzzle games and who doesn’t like doing alot of thinking.\n\nThe goodThe meat of the game, atleast for me, is the combat and the platforming. Platforming plays a huge role on the game, there are alot of areas filled with deadly traps and you need to have great timing to manage to get through. Combat is like the previous game, you start with very basic combos but as you make your way through the game and increase your level by earning experience, you’ll unlock more combos. Do not be deceived by the only two attack buttons. Not only you’ll unlock more combos as you progress through the game, but you’ll also unlock more weapons or upgrade your main weapon, allowing you not only to annihilate your enemies in new ways but also to access previously blocked areas and paths.\n\nAs it was the case with the previous game, you’ll be gradually introduced to new enemy types and each one of them felt unique on their own way to me. Bosses are also really well done, each one of them requiring you to adapt to a change in their attack patterns which helps keep the gameplay refreshing and challenging.\n\nThe somewhat badNow let’s talk about what I didn’t really like about the game. First of all, the fact that it is a 3DS port, even though it is in HD, doesn’t really help the game at all. The graphics look very dated with low resolution textures and on a 1080p monitor there are black bars on the sides. That said, I did find the cutscenes rather well executed with a cell shaded look to them, along the likes of Borderlands and Telltale games.\n\nEven though backtracking is something characteristic of metroidvanias, and even though I’m a huge fan of the genre, I tend to get bored when going back to places that I’ve already visited. It would be nice if a new type of enemy would show up in these ocassions. But considering that it took me around nine hours to complete the game (not 100% though) I guess it isn’t that bad at all.\n\nVerdictMirror of Fate is a pretty well executed metroidvania and I recommend it to any fans of action/adventure platformers with a focus on combat and exploration, even if you’re not a fan of Castlevania. It has enough enemy variety to make you rethink your attack strategy and it features some nice sections of platforming.","February 27","true","9.2"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","16","19","0","0"

The combat is good and most of the levels are designed well enough. However there are a couple of boss fights and very poorly designed levels that require hair pulling, frustrating precision to make progress and when you fail you're forced to repeat stuff you already did making you want to throw your controller across the room.\n\nIt's not required to play LOS 2, as they recap the story to date but it's a nice addition for the gothic horror fan and if you played LOS 1 to completion.\n\n7/10 Overall","June 8, 2014","true","17.5"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

It's a direct sequel to the first Lords of Shadow and takes place about 30 years after the ending of that game. There's a combo system with new moves to unlock as you level, secrets to find, and upgrades to collect, much like the old school Castelvanias. The music is amazing too.

And it seems I was partially right.\n\nThis new Castlevania plays like some of the older games, like a Metroidvania game.\nYou'll fight your away through the castle while solving puzzles and collecting better gear and upgrades. The game allows you to play as several characters and I expected every character to play the same way, but was pleasantly surprised that each of them had a different skillset.\nMirror Of Fate was also longer than I expected (maybe even a bit too long), with each chapter taking about 2-3 hours to complete.\n\nSome small annoyances were some of the checkpoints and the controls, which felt a big sluggish and unresponsive.\n\nThe graphics have been upscaled (and upgraded ?) from the original 3DS version but they still have that 'fuzzy', unsharp look. It doesn't look special, and I guess it doesn't have to be. The style fits the game and the cinematics - which have an entirely different style - were actually quite cool I thought.\nIf I had to rate it I'd give it a 7/10 so in my opinion it's absolutely better than Lords Of Shadow, even if that's partly because it's faster paced.\n\n[Rating: 71/100]","April 3, 2014","true","7.1"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","21","30","0","0"

After I played the first game- which I found to be a great first step albeit not without some noticeable flaws- I was looking forward to playing its sequels. And when I got to Mirror of Fate, it did not disappoint.\n\nWhereas the first Lords of Shadow was primarily a hack and slash beat 'em up with Prince of Persia style platforming, Mirror of Fate combines the combat of the first Lords of Shadow, the platforming of the original Castlevania, and the exploration of the Symphony of the Night-style Metroidvanias, mixing them all together to form a playstyle all its own.\n\n\nVisual Presentation: 2.4/3\n\nWhile not as visually stunning as its predecessor, the scenery in Lords of Shadow still does not disappoint. It manages to showcase a wide variety of areas within the castle, each with its own unique feel and artistry behind it, all of which is very well done.\n\nThe story, while not necessarily bad, is rather short and simplistic- and the only real "twist" to the game's plot is revealed in the opening cutscene. It's presented well enough, but if you're hoping for the story-heavy narrative that was presented in the first game, you will be disappointed.\n\nAlso, I would like to complain about the cutscenes... For some reason, the game has FMVs that are done in a completely different style from the main game and in-engine scenes; while they're not bad on their own, the contrasting style is a bit of annoying, being an unnecessary and jarring change- though not as bad as that of the DLC cutscenes in the first Lords of Shadow.\n\n\nAudio Presentation: 2/2\n\nThe flawless voice acting of the first game returns, and while there's not nearly as much of it, what is there hasn't lost a step, including Robert Carlyle reprising his role as Gabriel Belmont.\n\nThe music is wondrous, being ambient when it needs to be, and powerful when it comes to boss fights. For the most part, you have these quiet, eerie themes which add much to the atmosphere of the haunted castle, and it really picks up when it needs to. There's really not much to discuss here, I can't think of a single thing in this area to complain about.\n\n\nGameplay: 4.8/5\n\nAs mentioned in the opening comments of this review, Mirror of Fate seems to combine elements from all three styles of former Castlevania games, and blends them together into something all its own. The game is divided into three chapters (plus a prologue which only adds a few minutes to the game), each of which has you playing as a different character: Simon Belmont, Alucard, and finally Trevor Belmont.\n\nPlatforming at times is reminiscent of the original Castlevania games, whether you're jumping over pits of rancid water, using your whip to swing over pits too large to jump on your own, or climbing up the signature Clock Tower that so often tells you that you're near the end of your journey.\n\nBut mind you, you don't start out with all your abilities... Much like the more recent main series Castlevania games, exploration is key. While the main game can be quite short, there's plenty of hidden goodies to find in true Metroidvania fashion, although in some ways it feels more Metroid than 'Vania. What I mean by this is that you're not finding RPG-style equipment dropped by enemies and increasing your stats by leveling up, but rather, you instead can find health, magic, and subweapon increases scattered throughout the castle, all hidden to various degrees. The map system is an excellent aid for this, and even allows you to take notes to remind yourself to go back to an area you couldn't reach before.\n\nAnd finally, we have combat- while not nearly as varied as the original Lords of Shadow, the combat here is still quite solid, maintaining the direct attack/area attack style that was originally found in Lament of Innocence. Whereas in Lament of Innocence and Lords of Shadow, area attacks were meant to hit lots of enemies all around you, Mirror of Fate takes a slightly different approach due to its 2D sidescroller nature, and instead makes it so that area attacks are more focused around attacking both ground and air- while most area attacks will still leave your six exposed to enemies.\n\nEach character has two subweapons which are unique to them. While none of the weapons can be combined with magic as in Lords of Shadow, they can all be charged up to unleash more powerful versions of them. Some are redesigned versions of classic Castlevania subweapons- such as the axe, boomerang (cross), oil flask (holy water), and hourglass (stop watch), while two others are newcomers to the series in the form of bats and electric bombs. In classic Castlevania style, you collect hearts which serve as ammunition for these weapons, and for some reason do not heal you... People have been confused by this since 1987, I'm not expecting an answer now.\n\nIn addition to their weapons, each character has two unique types of magic, one defensive in nature and one offensive. Simon calls upon the power of a holy maiden to protect himself from attacks, or upon the power of an ancient warrior to fire arrows upon his foes. Alucard can transform into a mist to dash through enemies and drain some of their life force, and can turn into a wolf to increase damage. And finally Trevor can use the medallions from Lords of Shadow, allowing him to heal himself with attacks via light magic, or simply deal more damage through them with shadow magic.\n\nBoss fights are interesting and varied, and as with Lords of Shadow, they are the best part of Mirror of Fate. They represent the most powerful minions under Dracula's command, and eventually even Dracula himself, giving intense challenges and often blocking the path of the greatest rewards.\n\nFinally, quick time events have be drastically reduced from Lords of Shadow; no longer do they interrupt the flow of gameplay every time you need to perform a finisher, though they do still appear at a few points in the game, including a "boss battle" which is just one long quick time event sequence.\n\n\nFinal Verdict: 9.2/10\n\nAll in all, Mirror of Fate is a game that takes the best of the new and the old, and learns from the mistakes of its predecessor. While it doesn't bring anything particularly new to the franchise, it does make an effort to ensure that everything it does, it does well. It is an excellent game that I can see appealing to a large variety of fans, including those who enjoy action-adventure games, those who enjoy beat 'em ups, and those who enjoy platformers.","December 6, 2014","true","26.3"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

It feels like they tried to import the attacks from the 3d games, but those don't lend themselves well to the 2d format, mostly making combat very long and tedious.  Normally I enjoy Metroidvania type games a great deal, but in this case, they seem to have tried to port instant death falls into the format.  In classic Castlevanias, this is fine, because you aren't looking for a great deal of vertical exploration and any fall should be considered deadly.  Meanwhile in a Metroidvania where you're actually trying to look for unusual routes it becomes a punishment for exploration, as it does here.  Again, tedious.  Then of course, we get the Quicktime events.  I will never understand why people feel the need to cram these into games, especially ones that trigger when I have an unavoidable traversal of a section that already slows movement.  Boy howdy, mashing a button repeatedly to progress sure is fun to do over and over again.\n\nIts not a terrible game, its just not terribly engaging and has enough flaws that I eventually just got bored and decided to move on, and I say this as a person who's beaten Castlevania 3 and got 102% in SOTN.  All in all, its a shame because the artwork and soundtrack are beautiful, and they really did get the overall atmosphere spot on.","November 30, 2014","false","6.8"," 22 of 34 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","22","34","0","0"

Writing's not horrible and I was entertained with stoic leads throughout so all was well in the end. Gameplay-wise... well, I stand by what I said in the opening. Wailing at enemies with your whip and familiar secondary weapons/powers while contending with what is essentially an average platformer really doesn't gel well because you have this constant and clear separation between the two for the sake of simplicity. Bosses are one of the visual highlights, but they don't really break the mold of recognizing a pattern and exploiting it with extreme prejudice with a sprinkling of QTEs throughout. Metroidvania aspect suffers from smaller areas, although going for 100% character completion is still a lot of fun if you can be bothered to backtrack after the fact.\n\nIn the end I still rate Mirror of Fate a net positive, though. Why? HD update benefits the game immensely with its gorgeous gothic mood and proper controls uplift it considerably compared to original release, not to mention it was also a competent attempt at expanding this new Castlevania continuity. I, for one, am not too hung up on constantly comparing the reboot to the original series and can live with both existing just fine.","January 18, 2015","true","11.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

However, some of the visuals (see my recent screenshots for that) are pure eye candy for a gothic lover. The point in which these game shines is the combat and platforming: the game combines the 2D style of the original games and the combat system of the LoS trilogy in a great way.\nBut these game isn't perfect: the story is good enough to tie the two LoS games, but it's nothing that shines; the music is really forgettable and bland; there is no weapon difference between the playable characters (you will always have a whip, be it Simon's or Alucard's) and the boss fights are predictable.\nOverall, the fair price, responsive controls and sweet combat make for a great entry in my favourite video game franchise.\n\nSCORE: 82/100","April 2, 2014","true","12.1"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I completed this game on normal. Didn't go achievement or secret hunting.\n\nFirst off, some of the artwork still shines through, barely. Even with the 3DS roots. Seriously, if MercurySteam goes under, I hope the artists land on their feet. The games (non-3ds ones anyway) are gorgeous. In my opinion at least.\n\nAnyways I thought it was the worst of the 3 games, and I didn't love Lords of Shadow 2 (though I do tepidly recommend it, still). It's a bit unfortunate that for the narrative this game is so important to the others because it was a bit of a chore to play through. After the significant events tucked away in the first game's dlc, this game sets up the stage for the sequel (which pretty much fumbles it away, but whatever).\n\nThe game starts slow and is a quite a drag. Everything is so plain and drab and boring looking. Enemy variety is slim, and music is uninteresting.\n\nThe game gets better in the second act. You end up in the interior of the castle more, which is a much more interesting and visually engaging environment. There's also a smattering of puzzles (some of which can actually get a bit clever) and most of the enemy encounters actually become interesting to fight. You end up having to use your movesets in a smart way in order to get past guarding enemies or figure out what they are vulnerable to.\n\nI do greatly dislike, however, that when you level up, you learn additional abilities and extent your moveset, but you have to go into the menu to see what they are. Half of the time I couldn't be bothered. The series is known already for having hints be too prevalent, but it would have been nice for it to simply say "you've leveled up, try LT and X in the air". Or something..\n\nThe third act is worse than the second. You end up with some really boring encounter with bosses that have too much health in general. Yet they have repetitive attack patterns, and as they change up their moves when you deplete their health, the game effectively pauses and tells you exactly how to avoid it. It's really lame. These enemies are recycled too, so it really just becomes a chore when you see the boss 3 or 4 more times before reaching the end. Heavy use of "degraded boss" trope I suppose.\n\nThe last act also has a lot of "A for awesome" including two "Boss Fights" that are literally just an extended QTE. Very lame.\n\nPlay it if you want the full trilogy experience, but I wouldn't make it an obligation.","April 15, 2014","false","12.6"," 38 of 65 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","38","65","0","0"

Despite originally being made for a portable console, this game overexceeds in entertainment and action.  You can see the outstanding work that the makers really put into it like all the Lords of Shadow games.  The funny thing was I kept telling myself during the most of the game "I can't believe that this was originally a Nintendo DS game!!"  MoF is the 2nd game in the 3 part LoS series (taking place between LoS1 and LoS2).  You mostly play 3 characters at different times in the storyline.  You begin your jouney as Simon Belmont, then after his Act you play as Alucard, then after that you play as Trevor Belmont.  Technically it's 4 but playing Gabriel is only a tutorial.  MoF goes back to its 'Metroidvania' roots for the gameplay which is similar to SotN in terms of wide open castle exploration.  This is a good thing in terms of replay value for collecting all the power ups after finishing the game.  The artwork had an amazing port over considering again it was originally made for a portable console.  The music is FANTASTIC.  I would highly recommend this game for anyone who has enjoyed any of the LoS games, would like more depth into the LoS folklore, or miss yelling at your computer like the old days saying "YOU CHEATING @SS SONAVA B*TCH, F*CK UUUUUUUUUUUUUUU" accompanied by a middle finger and/or fist wave.

I originally avoided this one on 3DS because it was just so abysmal on such a low-res display.\n\nPlaying it in HD is far more impressive. the low polygon count and some textures obviously reflect its 3DS heritage, but overall the game looks pretty good. I did have some unexpected framerate problems in some spots, though.\n\nThe gameplay took some getting used to for me. I don't think it was until halfway or a third of the way through that I felt like the gameplay really clicked and I started understanding what I needed to do to fight enemies effectively. That, or the powers they give you just start becoming pretty good.\n\nCompared to the Metroidvania games, *ALL* of the actions feel sluggish. Especially climbing and jumping. Overall the game feels a little clunky and slow, but the combat system is interesting, especially as you start unlocking more moves.\n\nOne thing that didn't sit right with me though is the music in this game. I generally love Castlevania music, and I barely even noticed the music in this game. It seemed like there wasn't any most of the time, and what little was there didn't add to the setting of the game. Some epic boss fight music or just eery castle-crawling music would've been nice.\n\nEnemies also have a tendency to corner you in this game with no decent way to escape without taking damage, which is extremely frustrating.\n\nOverall, an OK Metroid experience.

It starts off with the weirdly rewritten and retconned storyline that messes with events that happened in Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse. Not wanting to spoil anything, but the big revelation of Mirror of Fate doesn't make sense in the context of established Castlevania lore. You may not care, but after 20 years of playing pretty much everything bearing the Castlevania name this just feels wrong to me and sets the stage for things to come.\n\nThe game is split into three acts, each seemingly based around the idea of pleasing one aspect of the fanbase. Act 1 is overall pretty basic, feeling a bit like the old NES/Gameboy titles, meaning you got limited movement options and only a limited amount of attacks at your disposal. It is also the only part of the game with the classic "Axe" subweapon. Act 2 is for the Symphony of the Night-fanboys, you get to play as Alucard and two of the major scenes are actually puzzle solving. Finally, Act 3 seems to be there for the Lords of Shadow-people with lengthy QTE-scenes and the combo system fully unlocking, allowing to do some serious damage to some of the most dangerous enemies in the entire game.\n\nWhile the focus of each act seems to differ, the tools used are pretty much the same. Each act plays kind of similar, you enter the Castle needing to find a couple of upgrades that allow you to either overcome enviromental hazards or unlock doors. I guess this was supposed to please the Metroidvania-crowd. The sad reality is that exploration isn't fun and the map-layouts are way too obvious when it comes to secrets. So whenever you get stuck on something like a new type of door that you can't enter because you need a certain ability chances are that a couple of hours ago you were in the exact same situation with one of the other characters. It kind of make sense to just grab all upgrades for a character and just get the missing "secrets" which are basically just chests that increase your magic, hp and ammo. Yeah, you don't level up like in all the Igarashi-games to get more HP and magic, leveling up in this game exclusively unlocks new "combos". Overall, the sense of accomplishment and the satisfaction you get from exploring the Demoncastle in the japanese Metroidvanias is pretty much non-existant in this title because the rewards are so underwhelming. You don't get new equipment or items either and there are no clever subsystems at work like the Soul-system in Aria of Sorrow. Besides, the maps are pretty straightforward often just empty halls and corriodors with the occasional thing haning from the ceiling that you can latch onto with your whip - not impressed by the leveldesign at all.\n\nOkay, so it may not be the best Metroidvania - surely combat and platforming are better than games from 20 years ago? I am afraid that ain't so - in fact, the controls in this one are super-weird. It took me two acts to get into the groove of the weird physics at work here. Particularly mid-air control is extremely "off" factoring in some kind of momentum - it's nothing like the original NES Castlevanias that had a very distinct jumping mechanic that forced you to do a jump and live with the results nor is it like Symphony of the Night that gave you much more control over jumps and even allowed you to correct mistakes by allowing double jumps and directing your character when falling. Mirror of Fate seems like a mix of these two entirely different mindsets of how to do jumping in 2D and doesn't feel "good" in the process. To make matters worse, the collision detection especially when jumping and grabbing on to things is VERY forgiving allowing you to hold on to ledges while the action actually looks like you would miss. You kind of auto-correct a couple of pixels once you are in the vicinity of a ledge. This looks and feels downright amateurish, it also makes some of the more complex platforming sections a bit of a chore because your characters often "stick" to ledges you don't want them to or they pull up on platforms eventhough you just want them to drop down or jump off to the side. Again, there is a weird mix going on between very forgiving and being kind of strict with collision detection at the same time, which ends in seemingly floaty and unresponsive platforming that has nothing on some of the classic levels of the Castlevania series.\n\nNeedless to say that combat suffers from not sticking to one design philosophy as well. Basically, you got the Lords of Shadow "spectacle fighter"-engine crammed into a 2.5D action-platformer. Which I am personally not enjoying, not only is the execution kind of weird and borderline unresponsive at times - you also get a ♥♥♥♥♥on of moves (18 in total) of which a lot serve no practical use. Without being able to properly combo/cancel from one move into another and (depending on the "power" of a move) the inability to stunlock/interrupt enemy attacks a lot of moves aren't viable in my opinion. Combat just doesn't feel right. Instead of fancy moves I would have prefered limited but practical attack options. Also, in order to justify combos all enemies have enormous amounts of HP. This is nothing like classic Castelvania where the majority of enemies yield after one or two hits, instead you wail on even the lowliest of creatures. It becomes tiresome and samey, there are only so many times that a ground attack into launcher into air combo move is exciting and cool, especially when there is no need to be fancy cause there is no benefit in style-killing trash. Obviously, somebody thought it was a good idea that pretty much all enemies can block your attacks too, and while they were at it they threw in "unblockables" that you have to dash away from or jump over (still getting hit more often than not because as mentioned before you can't exactly cancel out of certain animations adding delay between inputs and resulting in somewhat sluggish feeling).\n\nThat said, enemy variety as well as attack patterns are lacklustre and for whatever reason the Hunchbacks (or Fleas as they used to be called) show up way too much, adding some sort of unnecessary comic relief that I didn't care about.\n\nTo sum it up, controls, combat, exploration as well as lore is kind of borked in Mirror of Fate. It feels vastly different from pretty much all the (2D) Castlevania games before it and that is NOT a good thing in this case. Finally, and that is probably the most subjective part of this review: I am not a fan of the art direction, visuals, the soundtrack and voice acting. For some reason the cutscenes between levels are pretty cool looking, with a nice cel-shaded comic book look with some excellent textures and a very nice detailed look to them. But there is nothing like that in the actual game - instead they chose a very realistic look that just never really takes off making the game look a lot worse than it could have looked if they would have done it entirely in the aforementioned "comic style". Most areas look kind of bland without much detail and a lot of them feel the same - this is nothing like the colorful and vastly different levels and areas found in both classic Castlevanias as well as Metroidvanias. There is a lack of truly memorable setpieces, though the game shifts into a bit of a higher gear in the final act.\n\nLikewise, the music is hardly noteworthy (for the most part there isn't any real music playing) and doesn't even feature ANY of the classic Castlevania themes. In the end, this is like the one Castlevania that tried its hardest to be anything but a Castlevania. Being a fan of that series (mostly the old stuff when Castlevania was still a force to be reckoned with) I simply cannot recommend this to anyone that enjoys the classic Castelvanias or the Igarashi titles. It is not only a somewhat boring action-platformer with some seriously flawed mechanics, but more importantly a terrible Castlevania game not worthy of the name.

I like them linear:P Yet i decided to give this a try.\n\nThe game mechanics are pretty solid. Combat does get somewhat boring though, not much variety in the melee combat, although the secondary weapons are quite creative and fun to use. The story is an interesting aspect of the game - it's not necessary to understand either LoS or LoS2, but its a good filler.\n\nIt was a bit too long for my taste though, at just over 10 hours. For a metroidvania style, there isn't much fun in the backtracking part, and the storyline is somewhat linear still. But the art style and the environment are really impressive and makes for a great foundation for the game.\n\nAll in all, I'd recommend this game for more dedicated Castlevania fans.

Told in a reverse sequence of events, similar to Memento, the character development is minimal with only the short dialogues at the beginning, and towards the end pushing the narration forward. Some of the villains are quite imaginative, e.g. The Toy Maker, but there is not nearly enough enemy variety to keep the campaigh interesting, 8-10 hours can give you 80%+ game completition, with only returning to earlier parts of the castle for upgrades for higher difficulties or the punishing Boss Rush mode a reason to return for a second helping.\n\nManaging to shrink the whip heavy game-play to 2D is not easy, but this, along with the haunting soundtrack is where MercurySteam succeeds most. Sub-weapons return, and each of the three main characters, Simon, Alucard and Trevor each have their own abilities too. Whip abilities pass from one character to another as they level up, but unlike the other games it is linear rather than being able to chose your own moves. (This also makes no sense chronologically,)\n\nLevel design at times is alright, but whoever Dracula gets to decorate his castle should really invest in some good lighting and colours outside of grey, brown and black. Characters feel heavy, platforming is dense ledge grabbing, with occasional air dashing, jumping and whip swinging mingling with the common combat against Dracula's hoards. The game is dark, very dark. But the art design, at times, is Gothic, if a little flat and too constrained.\n\nI can't recommend this for anyone hoping this was a return to form the old-school CV ways. If you enjoyed LOS then it's worth a glance, but otherwise look elsewhere.\n\nMemorable Moment: The First Few lines Alucard spoke.

SPOILER: He later replaces his Beast Hunter whip with his father's Combat Cross. This guy has always been my overall favorite Belmont in all the franchise. Based on the "Castlevania Chronicles" incarnation of the character, Simon doesn't resemble a feminine bodybuilder. He actually looks like a MAN and not a WOMAN! He's got massive muscles, a tough attitude and a straight-forward determination to slay Dracula. The scottish accent they gave him made the character EVEN BETTER! This is my FAVORITE incarnation of Simon! He's got some really cool secondary abilities and wicked awesome attacks! Love it! SPOILERS:  He later finds the spirit of his mother that becomes his own "guardian angel" that blocks attacks against you (called "Spirit of Belnades"). Then he finds the spirit of a holy man who died in the castle and becomes a more offense-oriented "guardian angel" called "Spirit of Schneider" (another old school reference). They both fill the slots of what would've been special abilities of the other characters.\n\nAlucard\nVoiced by Richard Madden.\nA mysterious vampire determined to find a way of slaying Dracula forever. He roams the castle to obtain all of his lost abilities... or whatever is closest to them. His main weapon is the "Dark Pain" whip (Said to be made from metal close to the underworld and used by the most elite members of the Brotherhood. I've always thought that it was just too silly and the opposite of what they represent. I mean, how are you supposed to defeat Dracula with a demonic weapon? That's like fighting fire with fire!) and his sub-weapons include a Stopwatch (old school Castlevania weapon). He also has the ability to transform into a wolf and transform into mist (both old-school Castlevania references). His bosses are some of the TOUGHEST in the game! When you start out as Alucard he is pretty weak, meaning that you've got to find a way of out-doing your enemies until you've gained more levels and upgraded your abilities (once you've found them). He's more of an indirect fighter as opposed to the more head-on approach of Simon. Despite the difficult bosses, it is pretty fun to outsmart them.\n\nTrevor Belmont\nVoiced by Richard Madden.\nA knight from the Brotherhood of Light who is also Simon's father. Devastated by the truth the Brotherhood told him, he sents out to bring peace on his family name and end Dracula's horrible curse. SPOILER: He would later become Alucard. He is probably the strongest character in the game. He starts out with the ability to double-jump and slide down walls, and obtains much more. His weapon is the "Sub-Combat Cross" or "Trevor's Combat Cross". It is a replica of the original but has more practical uses than the aforementioned one. He also has some pretty cool sub-weapons like the bladed Boomerang and Electric Bomb. The Boomerang reminds me of a similar weapon used in "Castlevania: Bloodlines", which replaced the boomerang/crucifix from earlier and later games.\n\nDracula Gabriel Belmont\nVoiced by Robert Carlyle.\nThe main antagonist of the game. I felt that he was a fitting villain moreso than the lackluster Lords of Shadow from the previous installment. He is fought twice in the game: once as Alucard and again as Trevor (for the final fight). He can be a pretty tough fight for both characters. I never got past him on Hardcore difficulty for both Story and Boss Rush modes. SPOILER:The ending of the second battle is BULL*BLEEP*!!! There's just NO WAY a DEMONIC BEING can use a WEAPON OF GOD to kill a CHRISTIAN!! I was just venting like MAD when I saw the ending!\n\nThe Lost Soul\nVoiced by Michael Maloney.\nThe enigmatic being that haunts the castle and guides the way for every playable character in the game. SPOILERS:He turns out to be a spirit from the Mirror of Fate, hence why he guides the characters to their destiny. He's very vital to the game's story. I like to think of this character as a guardian angel (of sorts).\n\nGameplay\n\nStory Mode\nVery well done. Tells the story in an impressive blend of a 2D background with 3D characters. Simplistic animations that still keep you interested. The 2.5D gameplay gives us the feeling of a retro-Castlevania with the style of the modern 3D games. Sometimes, it can be confusing. You'll get stuck trying to figure out where you need to go on the map screen due to it's strange design. But after a while of playing, you'll figure it out eventually. There were some weird issues of enemies not disappearing after death and blocking the way, and the like.\n\nSoundtrack\nThe soundtrack would glitch out sometimes during the game. I kept thinking the music was repeating only to find that the song was meant to sound that way! After that, I was able to better tell the difference between glitch and intention in the music. While still on the subject of the music, despite having Trevor, Alucard, Simon and Dracula in the game, none of their themes from the original games were not included, much to my disappointment.\n\nBoss Rush Mode\nA REAL challenge for players! You're pitted against every boss in the game (from each character's story) and must defeat them all (without healing, refilling magic or regaining more sub-weapon ammo between fights). The damage you take as one character will carry over into the next boss fight. Intense and unrelentless, just how Boss Rush should be! If anything, this mode will entertain you longer than the Story Mode!\n\nDespite not having multiplayer, my brother & I kept feeling like a multiplayer mode (similar to "Castlevania: Harmony of Despair") should've been implemented.\n\nAchievements\nThese are throwbacks to the old school days. Some of them are references to the original NES Castlevania's. There are so many games with achievements that I'm not interested in, but this game's achievements actually made me want to play it more! One of my personal favorites is "Quick as lightning".\n\nConclusion\n\nPros\n+ Inclusion of great classic characters.\n+ Beautiful graphics upgrade with nostalgic 2.5D gameplay.\n+ Exciting and intense boss battles.\n\nCons\n- Horrible writing. Almost felt like they were trying to remake "Castlevania Legends" with all the horrible plot twists in it.\n- Oddly confusing soundtrack.\n- Still more unnecessary nudity and anti-God content.\n\nReplay Value\n4/5\n\nOverall Review Score: 6.8\nUnlike the others in the "Lords of Shadow" saga, "Mirror of Fate" is the ONLY installment that is worthy of the name "Castlevania"!\n\nAfterword\nI was impressed so much by this game. In all honesty, I'd much prefer the Castlevania franchise to continue in the vein of "Mirror of Fate".\n\nThank you for reading!\n- Oniell.","April 27, 2014","true","56.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

And I just realized: This is Classic Castlevania, let me explain: You are Simon/Trevor/Alucard (Dracula's Vampire Son), with a whip of leather/chain, that goes to defeat Dracula in a 2D castle. I didn't like the lack of characters, twelve character (Five of them only appear in the intro cinematic) and I do not count a description on the bestiary as a character. The main characters are, of course, Simon, Trevor Belmont, and Alucard. You play each Act with one of them. The other two characters are Dracula, the antagonist, and Gabriel Belmont, whom you play in the tutorial. And the last two characters are the Succubus, a boss who show a little bit of personality, and the Daemon Lord, a boss who appears like four times, and has more personalities than most.\n\nAs I said like seventy words ago, the bestiary has one paragraph for each monster and boss, which is nice, considering the giant amount of entries there is, but the problem/feature is that each monster has a scroll you have to find, also there are dead knights with a little story you can search for. The exploration consists of a lot of backtracking, as you gain new abilities, like in Act I (Simon) you change your leather whip to a chain whip with the abilities to swing on grappling spots (like in Super Castlevania IV, in which you also play as Simon) and many new areas are accessible. Or when you get the double jump in Act II (Alucard). Your arsenal consists of your whip, which every time you level up you gain a new combo, the subweapons, which run on ammo(you pick up ammo by enemies’ drop or breaking barrels), and two magics, which vary.\n\nAlucard was the best character by far, because he didn't breathe, so I could explore the water for more scrolls, his whip can swing from the ledges and chandeliers from the beginning, his magics are mist form (Default Q) which can dash-teleport, and if you do it through enemies you get your health back, and the wolf form (Default E) which causes more damage, he can also double jump and glide, he has claws for wall 2D wall-jumping. His subweapons are a time-slowing device and a bat-swarm (so you you can pretend you're Batman), and he can also take a skyline-like device to travel more.\n\nAt the end of the day, is it fun? Well yes, I enjoyed it, spend many hours on it, and I will recommend it to everyone who enjoyed Super Castlevania IV. You can't get really affectionate with the characters, since the only reason they have is revenge, but the combat is fluid, and the new skills fuse with exploration without you really noticing, except for one, which is almost crowbared in (Simon's Crossbow Ghost), but everything else made places I never thought of exploring accessible, so I like it.","April 4, 2015","true","83.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Helias/recommended/282530/","Helias","Black Puppet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Helias/","222 products in account","=HEADS UP=\nI had a review before this one about the game being good. This stays of course but i had to clarify some points and fix this old messy review that i made before.\n\n=INFO ABOUT THE REVIEW=\n1. This review might be a bit longer.\n2. This review is about my point of view and opinion. [If you disagree on a certain point or want to correct me: Be reasonable or i will ignore your comment.]\n\n=REVIEW=\nNow lets answer a question right at the beginning. Is the game good? Yes. Is the game enjoyable? For people that like games like Streetfighter and SSB probably.\n\nNow you are asking me: Why would you say such a thing? Shouldnt this be just the normal Castlevania just like the old times? Well yes you are right. This should be just like the old games and i sadly can say: It isnt. If i think of Castlevania i think of a Platformer/Bossrush with collectables you need to get further. In certain games they made the collectables into other things that you needed to progress but they were still there. You were involved into the story from the very beginning without actually knowing much about everything except if you have read much before playing about the game. So usually you were left at the beginning with your starterweapon to kill all that would stand in your way to reach your destination.\n\nIn this game it is most certainly just like i explained before with some bad little details to it. Well why am i saying little? There actually is a big bad detail to the game but that i will explain later. In this game there are three Storyarcs. In each Storyarc you play a different character what is totally fine. All three are easy to play and about the same except their powers. With each character you access a new part of the Castle to reach your destination that most of the time leads into Bossfights that are challenging. But they arent challenging because you have to watch out for their attacks like before.\n\nNow just shortly back to old Castlevania. If you remember correctly of how to avoid the enemy it was simply by actually avoiding your enemy. Now for those that dont understand: In the old games the Bosses were hard but easy to avoid. Their attacks were obviously predictable and only needed a certain amount of time and fails to get to the part of killing the boss. Sometimes you could avoid the boss so easily that you wouldnt even fail once. But dont get me wrong. It was not as easy as it might sound. You could avoid the boss easily but the Bossrooms were just as well sometimes Platforsections what made the whole fight into more than just: "You are trapped in tiny room. There is the Boss. Go kill". Sometimes the Boss used the Platforms himself. Sometimes the Boss got below the Platforms (and the screen) and tried to come up below you with an attack. Sometimes Platforms were the only thing you could use because the floor literally was lava. And sometimes just as well there were no Platforms what ment that the Boss had faster attacks that you had to avoid.\n\nBack to this game there is not much to say. "Dodge, Hit, Dodge, Hit, Dodge, Hit and Hit again". This is literally what this game is. It is a game for people that like Fightinggames but not for people that like Castlevania as what it was before. I mean i have seen other Castlevania games that were seriously just simple Fightinggames like Streetfighter or Mortalkombat. I just looked at them and they began to bore me to death. It was not what Castlevania was about. And yes of course you could say the same about Mario Kart and Hyrule Warriors (a game i still dont understand why it became so popular but that is a rant for another time) and you would be right. They were succesfull with what they were doing but then i ask you about the: Why?\n\nBecause it was fitting. Super Mario was playing in not so modern world but machines and cars would still be available in that point in time. Even big flying Pirateships as we saw in other games. It was fitting because the world was all about Fantasy and literally just a tad crazy in general. Going over to Zelda we have the same case. It was simply fitting (even though i didnt like it) and it would work in their world. But in Castlevania what is known to be a Platformer/Bossrush just like Metroid is (And no "OtherM" didnt change anything about that and i dont want anybody raging at me for mentioning it) it doesnt fit. It is simple as that. If you think what Castlevania is about can you see yourself and your character fighting a zombie in a Streetfighterstyle? I cant and that is the point.\n\nOh and i mentioned the collectables before. Well in the original as i stated before you had to collect them and go into the next stage. Sometimes in the games there even was a FINAL FINAL Boss right after the normal Final Boss. In one of the little Castlevania Stories that was available first on the GBA and then on the DS you had to collect certain things and use them at the same time to reach the actual Final Bonus Boss before killing the actual Final Boss. Killing the actual Final Boss would lead you to the normal Endscreen with Normal Ending. Killing the actual Bonus (I rather call it the End-)boss would lead you to the real good ending. Dont get me wrong: Both ending are good endings but in the one mentioned last you were sure that you had destroyed the Evil. It was a good feeling that you could achieve that.\n\nBut back to this game we have nothing like this. We have collectables but the only you got from them were upgrades of your 3 main stats that you needed to fight and survive. You didnt get new weapons, or trinkets that would do something. And that is about it.\n\n\nWould i recommend the game? Yes i would say so.\nWould i recommend the game to a Castlevaniafan? I would not.\n\nThis game is not like any Castlevania game i have played so far. This game is not a Castlevaniagame for me since there are so many elements missing that makes Castlevania what made Castlevania.\n\nIt was a horrible Night to have a curse.\nIt was also a horrible Night to play this game.","May 21, 2015","true","5.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

One thing to note on this game as the 2 big brothers it has, it's the huge attention to detail the developers had when developing the graphics, that even though are ported from a smaller console, the stages are very well created, with proper lighting, and even the smallest things like paintings or things on the walls are not repeated across the whole game.\n\n8/10","June 5, 2014","true","10.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I liked how it managed to capture some of the more cinematic fight mechanics of LoS 1 in spite being from a portable platform.

Being able to play different character sure was refreshing and attractive.\n\nStory wise, it is far superior to its predecessor. Perhaps because there is actually a Dracula now and our goal is to defeat him. The game WILL make you want to play Lords of Shadow 2; you are definitely going to want to know what happens to Gabriel and Trevor.\n\nGame wise, there is a lot to improve. Maps could be bigger and secrets could be harder to come by. Also the travelling across the map could be improved if the map was a single one as well. But remember, you are using three characters and they all have to discover their own sections.\n\nLike the first game, Mirror of Fate has an AMAZING soundtrack, i can’t stress that enough. Also it is beautiful even now that we are not exploring the outdoors like the previous game. But instead the castle looks dark and menacing with usual camera angles that will make you stop running and simply look and admire the background.\nCinematic were also pretty good, especially the boss fights during Act 3. Probably the 2 best fighting cinematic I have seen in a while.\n\nThe fighting was enjoyable; bosses were simple but at the same time not a walk in the park. If you go to play Lords of Shadow DLC, don't expect to find a boss like The Forgotten One, god knows that was painful enough. Also, midair dash, do i have to say more?\n\nFor 15$ you will get a good Castlevania experience, I would recommend you set the game at hardest difficulty from the start as well.","June 4, 2014","true","12.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game also controls like the LoS games. My main complaint is that the music is a slow, dull, repetitive set of maybe two or three songs (Was it more? I couldn't tell.); the music in the LoS series just doesn't compare to previous Castlevania games and MoF takes the cake for most boring soundtrack. I grew up with the NES, SNES, and PlayStation Castlevania games that had great soundtracks, so as someone that pays attention to game audio, I have high expectations when it comes to Castlevania games.

Some people keep saying "this is not castlevania" in comments I seeo n here, they think games have to always stay the same and be like "symphony of the night" well IMO I have not had as much fun with this type of game in many, many years and I am happy this game is here to enjoy. 9/10 from me!","March 30, 2014","true","36.8"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tankpig/recommended/282530/","tankpig","fart crap","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tankpig/","444 products in account","The second entry in the Lords of Shadow franchise, in my opinion, seems much more direct and tends to fix a couple of the flaws introduced in the first game. However, part of this could be due to the fact that this game is a different beast from the first. Like in my first review of Lords of Shadow, I'll go over the pros and cons.\nPros:\n-By far the biggest pro, in my opinion, is that this game feels much more in-line with earlier Castlevania titles outside of the Lords of Shadow franchise. It tries to be Symphony of the Night, and while it doesn't reach the caliber of that game, I do appreciate how the game takes notes from it and tries to incorporate aspects of it and even improves on it in a few regards, mainly giving you a better sense of direction and is much more plot-driven, which is probably the Lords of Shadow series' strongest point.\n-Unlike the last game, combat seems to be much less tedious and boring. They did away with the optional moves you have to unlock, and now you unlock them by levelling up, which is a much better decision. I also think they managed to make the magic system introduced in the first game have much better use in combat here, which was a gripe in my first review.\n-I understand this game was originally on the 3DS, and that shows in this port. However, looking at it from the context of the 3DS, the graphics manage to stand up pretty well in that regard.\n-I touched on it a bit earlier but I can't stress it enough: they made this game wayyyyyyyy less of a "where the ♥♥♥♥ do I go" game which the first LoS suffered from.\n-The nonlinearity of some parts of the game is a nice touch. Again, props for trying to be Symphony.\n\nAnd now, for the bad:\nCons\n-Trying to be Symphony. While this is a noble thing to do, I feel this game is trying to do it too hard. I'm going to mark this as a minor complaint though, since it is a good idea to try to be like a well-known and loved entry in the Castlevania series. I just feel the game could have accomplished more if it didn't stick to that too much.\n-While the battle system is much improved and actually more fun this time around, the pacing still seems to be a bit of an issue. Again, I feel it is much more improved than the first game, but it still bothers me a bit. Luckily it's much easier to skip seemingly "forced" battles. That's another mark off from this game, is that it tries to force you into a battle, but it is possible to skip. It's nice to have the option to run away from a battle, at least. (Note: I'm referring to cannon fodder enemies, of course you can't skip boss battles.)\n-Progression. I will say that I haven't beaten this game yet, and I've gotten to Act III. What I can say is that I know Act III is a little bit unnecessary, at least from a story standpoint, and maybe from a bit of a gameplay standpoint. It seems to me they got it mixed up from a story standpoint. Act III really should be Act I, with toned down difficulty, and then Act I or II could happen from that point on. It almost feels like filler.\n-Graphics, from a PC standpoint, are rather lackluster. You can definitely tell it's a 3DS game on a PC, and that's a bit of a disappointment. It would've been nice if they cleaned things up a bit for the PC port, but as it stands, I don't find graphics to really impact my enjoyment of a game, so I will consider this one a minor complaint as well.\n\nOverall, I'd say this game fares better than Lords of Shadow, as far as fun and enjoyment. Of course it still has problems, even some lingering from LoS, but I would rather play this over LoS. If you're a hardcore oldschool Castlevania fan and you want to play a LoS game, I would say just stick to this one since it seems much more in-line with how the oldschool games did things, while experimenting on being its own separate thing.","April 16, 2014","true","9.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's not a groundbreaking entry in the series, and it ultimately serves as a bridge from the original Lords of Shadow game to the second. However, this is a great example of what could be with a full-fledged, "metroid-vania" on next-gen consoles and perhaps PC (hopefully). If you comapre this game side-by-side with the other two LoS games, you might end up a little disappointed; this game should be viewed as a 'special entry' in the series as it was originally created for a handheld.\n\nThat said, it's still massively fun and looks gorgeous. Mirror of Fate is going to play in the vein of an old-school Castlevania with a new combat system implemented. There are a few QTEs that serve as a 'finishing move' and/or big boss battle sequences, but they aren't relied on so much that it hinders gameplay or becomes monotonous. The puzzle aspect of the game is prominent and there are some puzzles that will have you thinking for a bit, but there's really nothing that should stump anyone. Another difference in the core of this game that sets it apart from the other two is the leveling system, wherein instead of upgrading with a point system, you'll gain experience and be rewarded with a predetermined skill.\n\nAll in all, it's a nice Casltevania throwback adventure, but after all is said and done, it leaves me with a wanting for a more fleshed out adventure in a 'true HD' entry in the series. Mercury Steam has done a fantastic job in proving that the Castlevnaia name doesn't have to be confined to the 2D realm.

It should be noted that I am a big Castlevania fan and also that I still think it is sad and pathetic that this is the only "real" Castlevania game on Steam and is only barely that, but it is a good game.\nIf you are a true Castlevania fan than this is the only one of the three Steam games I could recommend playing.\nNot to say the other two are bad, just not the Castlevania experience you'd want.\nI will say that while I am a bit mixed on Mercury as a developer, this game further illustrates my growing foundness of the engine they use that I would like to see more of in the future, perhaps play with a bit myself if I could.\nI will say that if you are not familair with the new storyline of the Lords Of Shadow series reboot than this game is a mixed bag. Some say they where totally lost, but I disagree. To me you won't be totally lost in this game since it does a decent job of containing the story within itself. However it will spoil much of the ending to the first game.\nI know people will try and kill me for this, but I think this game's version of Alucard is better to the theme overall. Of course I prefer Ayami Kojima's version of him from the Igavania era, but I feel this new chap is more fitting to the vampire theme overall. He looks FAR more monstrous in his default appearance, but is still beautiful in my opinion.\nWhile this game is patthetic compared to some other games in the series and even to some fan clones here on Steam it is a good game that I enjoyed playing overall and more importanly it is a very solid port from the PS3/360/3DS versions.","June 3","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While I didn't like first Lords of Shadow all that much, apart from the stunning visual design and an intriguing, but porrly told story, its 2D sequel/side-story feels an improvement in almost every way. It's like most of the best things and few of the bad things from LoS put together in a 2D action adventure RPG platformer.\nWhile it does noticable, that the game was originally designed for portable devices with smaller screens and not very powerful hardware, MercurySteam still managed to create a very pretty game, which looks good even on big screen. There's less variety and chance for the artists to fully reveal their talant, where the game wants to look gothic and beautiful, it does it very well. Music, which was good, but slightly lost in desire to be "cinematic" in the original, felt more memorable and interesting here.\nFighting system is almost identical to the one from LoS, which means, that unlike many older 2D Castlevania games, there are not a *lot* of enemies on levels, but each enemy presents more challenge and a specific approach. I felt, that the fighting system actually felt more responsive and better working in 2D, than it did in full 3D in LoS, but maybe that's just me. Also, since there are 3 playable characters (+1 one in the prologue), each one has his own set of magic, secondary items and other helpful things or upgrades, which makes gameplay with each character a bit different, including the way you fight enemies.\nBig change from the original portable version of the game lies in the (welcome) removal of almost all QTE/button mashing sequences, which, sadly, also has a small negative. There are a few sequences and, technically, a boss battle, which works completely in QTE and with them being almost completely absent elsewhere, these sequences feel very alien and more of a weird annoyance, than anything else. But other than that, removal of QTEs and "mash the button to do a simple thing" moments is really nice.\nBiggest complaint I might have with the game is, surprisingly, the camera - something that, you'd think, cannot go wrong in a 2D sidescrolling game. Sadly, there are some weird choices - like chase sequences, where camera shows you more of where you came from, not where you're going and when you need to jump until the very last moment. Or the fact, that during the fights camera tries to helpfuly pan to the side, where the enemies are, and if there are enemies from different sides it tends to lead to hits from off-camera or player not being able to see some enemy at all.\nAnother complaint is almost ironic to voice. While I felt that Lords of Shadow should've been cut at least in half, that it was agonizingly long with lots of pointless padding, Mirror of Fate feels short. There are characters and threads that feel underdeveloped, some things are there probably just to tease Lords of Shadow 2 (which I haven't yet played) and, more importantly for a more Symphony of the Night-like Castlevania game, running around and exploring is so fun and exciting, and there's not enough of it. So while I hate the argument of judging the game by the time it takes to complete, I do wish Mirror of Fate has been longer, but quality longer, not padding longer. And when I feel that I can't get enough of a game, that probably means that I like it a lot.

It does everything right... So yeah, it's a 3DS port or something, but it's a rather full experience, with lots of content and GREAT gameplay... It's like a perfect combination of old-school feeling and modern game design.\n\nAlso, one I thing I love is that it doesn't have a million active keys like a lot of modern brawlers... Yes, there's quite a few but you can find a nice comfy set up on a keyboard so you don't need to worry about mis-clicking and finding the damn keys. That to me is a plus, since it's a problem which has really ruined a lot of other similar games.\n\nAnyways, for a port, it has, not only a lot of content, but a lot of extras and settings, which is good. Plus a very good menu with a list of moves and combos and enemies (and their info/weakness). It's really a very solid complete package. The game keeps it fresh by giving you 3 acts with a different hero each, albeit with similar attacks, but varied enough so it'll keep you happily progressing through. I haven't played any of the other Lord of Shadow games, so I'm not too aware of the universe's story, but the game did a competent job of introducing all characters and making the story understandable for a noob.\n\nIf I have one "complaint" it's that the graphics are obviously not as pretty as other PC games... But they're not jarring  either, in fact they're quite nice for a port (hence the quotations marks on "complaint"), I just kinda wish they made use of the full PC capacities, because as it is, it's pretty sweet, so imagine what could've been =P\n\nDefinetly recommended if you think you'd enjoy an old-school brawler spirit with a modern twist game.

As a person who's not usually fond of side-scrolling games, this has blown me away. The combat is a lot of fun, as you level up you unlock new moves/combos and EVERY single one has a use. The boss fights are insanely entertaining, although a little frustrating, a challenge is never a bad thing.\n\nI have found myself getting a little lost here and there, not noticing ledges I can jump up to and instead running around the lower floor looking for an exit. More than likey my own fault for simply not looking hard enough.\n\nGraphics are perfectly decent for the game, although strangely I found a few places in the game left me with some irritating lag...I'm not sure if this game should be run on a certain screen resolution or something, maybe the transfer from DS to PC hasn't been PERFECTED, even so, it's a minor hinderance and not a huge deal.\n\nNo rating yet, as I'm only about 20% through the game, looking forward to whipping my way through the other 80%!","April 3, 2014","true","1.9"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

This game is also suited for speedrunners.\n\nI think the value in this game is awesome even at full price which is like what 10 $ ?\n\nOne final note : Controller not recommended, but needed ( mandatory, a must have, no discussion here ).

Textures, while presumably improved from the 3DS version are still relatively low resolution and poly counts are quite low as well.  This wouldn't be a problem if the art design made up for it, but for the most you're running through rather drab backgrounds.

Much of it is re-orchestrated themes from the game's big brothers, but it still works and sets an appropriate tone for the game.  The cutscenes are thankfully 3D rendered and animated, with a cel shaded style I quite like.  I was dreading a slideshow or a "motion comic" given the game's origins and luckily that was unfounded.\n\nGameplay is fairly typical of a Metroidvania game.  Explore map, get new abilities and equipment to progress, run into stuff that you have to come back to access later.  Nothing is particularly new or novel, but it's all well done.

Overall, eveything is well paced with a good balance of combat, exploration, and puzzle solving.\n\nThere are few design choices that put a minor damper on the fun though.  For one, there's fall damage which seems like an oddly unforgiving choice.  It's not problem that often, but I just don't see a point to its inclusion.  Losing forward progress as a result of missing a jump is already enough of a hindrance.  The backtracking for powerups is also fairly tedious.  There are some teleporters here and there to speed things up, but you still spend a decent amount of time retreading old territory if you want all the powerups and "bonus" ending (trust me, not worth it).\n\nStill, overall I enjoyed the game and I'm glad I got it, but a big part of that is my interest in the Lords of Shadow universe. The game as a simple story, but it's well told and I liked how it expanded the fiction.  On gameplay alone, this doesn't hold up in comparison to some other recent 2D Metroidvanias, namely Guacamelee and Dust: AET.  To that end I would only recommend this to fans of the proper Lord of Shadow games or rabbid Metroidvania fans that have already played everything else available and want something new.

However, being a huge Castlevania fan, I m giving this game the benefit of the doubt. The story is really interesting, as with all the Castlevania games, so I didn't have a problem there. The graphics were really pretty and the design was asthetically pleasing. Well, except for Alucard; being my favorite character of the series, I was excited to know alucard was returning. After playing the game with him though, that is where my dissapointment began. Alucard looked unbelievably stupid, with a stupid outfit, and stupid hair, and a grey, blocky face. On top of that, the studio was lazy and gave him an identical move list and weapon to Simon, instead of a sword or something of the like. The I raelized that a lot of the gameplay was just frustrating, with bosses that were really awkward with the ported controls and 2-D platforming. I think the game was good overall, but I can't help but feel unsatisfied with it.

I'm a huge fan of the Castlevania series, although I've not played any of the Lords of Shadow games in the series until now, and Mirror of Fate was my first venture into this corner of the franchise. I knew, according from other reviews, that Lords of Shadow games are meant to be somewhat different to the rest of the series, but I was willing to give them a try to see if they captivate me.\n\nMirror of Fate is a smaller game that links the events of LoS 1 and 2, and unlike those games, it's a sidescrolling platformer for the most part, done in 2.5D (2-dimensional play but with 3D graphics). The first thing I noticed was how dull the visuals are. Most of the areas are just brown and grey, and most of the locations are just forgetable. The music is also barely noticeable at all. Nothing sticks out. Every area just feels the same.\n\nThe gameplay didn't really save it either. Most of it seemed quite repetitive to me. Enter room, fight baddies, climb a few walls, enter next room, fight more baddies, and so on. The combat doesn't know what it's trying to be. It uses the mechanics native to 3D games, such as parrying and dodging, but the whole game plays in 2D, meaning most times you have one enemy in front of you and one behind, and no matter which way you dodge, you get hit. Blocking is pointless, since you still receive tonnes of damage. So your only chance is to keep hitting the enemies and hope you kill them before your health bar depletes.\n\nI've fought a couple of bosses as well, and although they do provide some interesting combat situations, they have an overblown amount of HP, meaning you just have to chip away their enormous health bit by bit via the same technique.\n\nI eventually got stuck trying to ride an elevator platform that kept repeatedly getting destroyed by a gargoyle. After numerous unsuccessful attempts, I had to consult a walkthrough. Turns out there was some kind of a magical companion I had to find to help me with this section, except I've no idea where in the castle it is. The locations are all so boring and forgetable that it's no fun at all having to backtrack and re-explore them again (something that was fun with the previous Castlevania games). Once I've had enough exploring the same stone-grey areas, I decided to leave it there.\n\nMirror of Fate is not a bad game, but it lacks all the charm that made the Castlevania series so good. Every single aspect of it was a step down. Visuals, music, gameplay, even atmosphere felt subpar. It's by no means comparable to the likes of Symphony of the Night and Aria of Sorrow. I am starting to think that the only thing still left of the old gold Castlevania is the name.","August 25, 2015","false","3.4"," 20 of 42 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","20","42","0","33"

It featured large open levels with lots of space for exploration, hardcore 2d action, memorable characters, cheesy-but-still-cool gothic atmosphere.\nThat series is dead. There hasn't been a proper metroidvania in it for aeons. The game we are looking at now is Castlevania's dead, empty husk, an unholy mockery of once great series, rotten inside, yet still moving, animated by evli marketing wizardry.\nThe game plays like an insult towards everyone who loves metroidvania. Yes, it does feature getting upgrades, backtracking and searching for secrets. However, the game is divided into three chapters, each one so small that it becomes a travesty. You don't look for secrets, you just get the available power-ups, then go back to collect the previously unreachable chests. Other than that parody of metroidvania backtracking, the game is linear, moving from level to level.\nThe gameplay is basic and mindless: timed blocks and other feints are useless, you just button mash your enemies into oblivion. Puzzles are either rudmentary or tedious. Platforming parts are so easy they can be completed blindfolded. The story is an over-the-top fake-dramatic sausagefest: "you killed my mother! Also, you're my father! Also, *I*'m *his* father! Also, you killed *his* mother! Also, NOOOOOOO". Dialogues are written so badly that I don't even blame the voice actors for sounding like they are falling asleep reading  them. Clearly, not a single person in the development team gave a bite about the game, so why should they?\nIf you love what Castlevania used to be, avoid this soulless cash-grab. Play Ori and the Blind Fortest, Axiom Verge, Dust, Shantae, Cave Story... Or wait for Bloodstained to come out. Don't support this flogging of a dead horse. Castlevania isn't, and will never be what it used to be, let it rest in peace.","May 10","false","12.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

The game has a decent combat system, but the design overall for the game is pretty horrible compared to its prequel. There is just no camparison.\n\nDid I get burned by a CLASSIC game series AGAIN? (*ahem* Lords of Shadow 2*) YES.... most definitely yes.\n\nI just wish I could finish Castlevnia 2: Simon's curse. ♥♥♥♥ it has been 20 years when it was released on the NES ffs.\n\nIf you really love the Castlevania series, this game makes a mockery of it. SO ♥♥♥♥ing sad.\n\nFFS when are they going to get the original programmers involved in this series again? The only successful series in the modern era has been the prequel to this game. (Lords of Shadow 1)\n\nThis game is a shoddy attempt at a spin off from an ALREADY successful game. If you are  true fan of the series, I would NEVER recommend it. IN FACT, I am going to ask STEAM for a refund on the basis of its suckdom.\n\nI hope I get a refund, cuz this has happened before on STEAM where lackluster programmers and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ artists try to copy an already successful game. (*Ahem* Batman Arkham Origins Blackgate*) It is ♥♥♥♥ING SAD.\n\nFFS Simon has an IRISH accent in the Cutscenes when clearly this game was set in Romania/Transylvania from the original NES release!!! Are they just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ on the flames out of spite and jealousy of a masterpiece? I DON'T ♥♥♥♥ING KNOW... but alll I know is that I was fooled again into thinking someone actually cares about the success of this game series, and I was ripped off by a charlatan game team. Perhaps they are just using the name to rip off people that have a sentimental connection with the ORIGINAL concept of Castlevania. That is my best guess.\n\n♥♥♥♥ing posers are ruining this series.\n\nI am not saying that the programmers that created this game are ♥♥♥♥ing losers, but ♥♥♥♥ man.... they gotta do better than this to succeed in life.

This is especially apparent while jumping (which happens a lot), where you actually lose speed in the air rather than continue at the previous pace.\n\n...forcing you to manually put out markers for items and points of interest on the map. Maybe this was an acceptable solution when the game was released on 3DS, due to the touch screen, but IT SUCKS having to do it with a controller.\n\n...making the game save every time you close the map, adding load times for no reason whatsoever.\n\n...adding a level system but not putting it to good use. From what I can tell, there are no stat increases and the only thing you can actually gain from levels are skills.\n\n...reusing the idiotic concept from Lords of Shadow, where you're interrupted by freshly spawned enemies halfway through pulling cranks.\n\n...making you take fall damage, meaning you can and will die from falling or making a drop from too high up.\n\n...sending you back to the start of the area if you die, effectively resetting your exploration of the map and making you have to do it all over again. This + the previous concern = pure bullsh*t.\n\nAlso, I can't say I condone their decision to go with a boring 3D art style rather than gorgeous pixel graphics like the previous sidescrolling entries in the series.\n\nTo sum it up: Don't buy this game.\nIf you already have, do yourself a favor and don't waste your time playing it. Go play Symphony of the Night, Aria of Sorrow or some other Castlevania game that's actually good.","May 4","false","2.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"

But being a 2D game fixes some problems the predecessor had. For exmaple you do not need lock on a target which was not possible and also you won't have the problem that an enemy attacks you without you noticing because the camera does not show him.\nDuring the game you will play three different characters that have the same attack- and moveset but each one has his own items and magics. The game has very little story. Nevertheless it motivated me because I wanted to know what is going to happen.\nThe soundtrack is good but most certainly not as good as the ones from the older Castlevania games with themes like 'Bloody Tears' or 'Vampire Killer'.\n'Mirror of Fate' has very little freedom. It only exists in the way that you can decide whether you progress with the story or search for secrets which aren't hidden very well in most of the cases. Anyways I liked the idea of rewarding you with a cutscene for finding all the secrets. The only downside is that the cutscene is really boring.","April 6, 2014","false","12.9"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

If you had fun playing the other games in the Castlevania: Loads of ♥♥♥♥ series, go ahead and play this one too. While you're at it, stop reading this review and get a ♥♥♥♥ing lobotomy. This review isn't for you. This review is for Castlevania fans.\n\nThis game ill resembles a Castlevania title. The moment the game gave me a mother ♥♥♥♥ing quicktime event, I realized that my boi pussi had been violated by the fifteen dollar price tag. The combat system is full of combos that are seldom useful because button mashing is much more effective. It feels like they took the body of the Castlevania franchise, gutted out everything beneath the skin, and stuffed it with God of War. A good Castlevania game is like pulling a three day LSD bender on labor day weekend; everything around you should feel extremely lethal and you should be constantly moving.\n\nCastlevania: Mirror of Fat has a sluggish style that seems everything but natural. The linear direction of the game ruins the Metroidvanian element of a big, multi-directional map. It's also really confusing. How a game can feel both linear and confusing at the same time is beyond me. Perhaps it's because the map branches into multiple areas, but doesn't connect them as well as the previous games. Remember those giant ♥♥♥♥ing keyholes from SotN that could take you to the other side of the ♥♥♥♥ing map?

I got excited at the prospect of a new 2d Vania. This is what I get for not researching my purchase. why is there a cutscene introducing every single enemy? like why the ♥♥♥♥ do i have watch the camera hover on a zombie slowly walking towards me before i can kill it? is this the game's idea of hand holding. and the other dozenish Castlevania games I don't think we ever needed the camera to super zoom in on an enemy just for us to notice he's there.\n\nAnd the platforming. Like Castlevania used to be known for its platforming, now its that Prince of Persia/Uncharted bs where you're just slowly holding the joystick in the direction of the shiny platform. Why did that even become a genre fad? Not to mention the plot is ♥♥♥♥ing stupid. Which I mean I don't mind story in a CV game but if you're gonna try superhard to make it good then actually make it good.\n\nDo not waste your money.

It does not work. The game is riddled with lazy QTEs, bad combat mechanics, and obstacles that just feel forced. Briding the gap between LoS 1 and 2, this is basically Lords of Shadow's version of Alucard's origin story, and they make it pretty obvious. By the time the "big reveal" at the end played out, I had already figured it out hours ago and was just bored. There's also an extra cutscene for those who feel like wasting enough time on this game to complete it to 100%, but said cutscene does nothing to set up anything interesting.

Mercury Steam did some work on the metroidvania elements, but they feel very simplistic when the general level design lacks the organic and interconnective feeling in the previous games.\nThey implmented fall damage into the game to create some tension in platforming, but it also makes the linearity even more obvious that the developer wants you to play in the way they want you to play.\nAnd there's performance issue which is very bizarre. It seems the game has two framerate caps: 30 and 60. When your PC can reach a framerate above 60 on a certain setting, it gives you 60 FPS. When it's between 30 and 60, the game locks at 30 FPS. It is literally a very odd port choice\nFramerate cap aside, the game doesn't run very well. During some cutscenes and special effects, you will see some severe framerate drops. The game's graphics is not top notch. Such performance is kinda unacceptable.\n\nFirst impression:\n2D graphic looks pretty good. The music is very nice and dramatic. The environment is dark and fit the Castlevania universe that I'm familiar with. Also the game runs well. Some players reported crash issues, but honestly, my first start of the game was problem free.\n\nAnd here's the cons: The combat feels a bit sluggish and inresponsive. Just like its console counterpart, every hit animation feels powerful yet slow. It works well in 3D environment that requires you to think before attack. I'm not sure that is the case in 2D. The responsive and reflex based Castlevania combat in previous 2D titles like Symphony of Night is not here in my judgement.\nI heard the game features 4 different characters instead of one protagnist. Honestly, I didn't think it's an issue, but the game literally throwed two different characters, a long period of time jump (57 years later), a huge block of text explaining the story of the original Lords of Shadow which I haven't finished yet, and some disjointed plot point on me in my first 15 minutes. I can't say that the story is bad for now, but it certainly left me a bad impression about the storytelling.\n\nI recommend the game for now because we haven't seen a solid 2D Castlevania for a while and the game has potential to pull it off.","March 27, 2014","false","3.7"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","2"

Yes.\nIs it like C:SotN?  Kinda\n\nControls: The combat is snappy; I block when I want to and I attack when I want to with no lag.   Movement on the other hand...well, I can only describe as 'assisted'.  There is no lag, but turns and movements (not combat rolls) start almost with momentum, jumps are strangely high/far,  and if you don't quite reach a platform visually, the game corrects and counts you as grabbing a ledge.  Less of bad programming and more of "Assisted Platforming".  Yes, that is what I will call it.\n\nCombat:  Fighting is fun.  Especially the fist boss, the night watchman.  It pulls heavily from it's parent C:LoS's movesets and includes timed blocks and unblockable moves.  They add in the 'hearts' and secondary weapons of previous games, but it seems like there may not be many options and you are limited to 5 of each.  At least they are very powerful and not linked to up+attack.\nI would complain about the random uninterruptable animations that let enemies move through your strikes, but I think it is that way because a veteren brawler could march right through combats if all strikes had effect.  You get used to it.\nWhat you don't get used to is the vibration.  Near constant rumble (all on high) for everything including footsteps sometimes.  You are only safe during loading screens.  If I were of opposite gender or had a custom controller this may be more enjoyable, but I just turn it off.\n\nMusic/Sound:  Nothing noteworthy.  The sounds are not "HD" so do not fade well or have too much variety as they were limited by the Gameboy hardware.  The music sounds nice and is very dramatic, but is also missing at times and none of it is memorable.  Nothing like old Konami titles (which used to be their best features) .\n\nGameplay:  Exploration is limited but the 'metroidvania' feel is still there. . .Just missing some of the spirit, and that came from level design and map planning.  Shadow Complex got this right (and I would love to see that on steam) but others don't:  Just like a Feng Shui house needs 'circulation', so does a great metroidvania map in order to not feel linear.  Areas that interconnect.  So far the layout of this game is in chapters and in a line very similar to C:LoS.   So, some of the soul is lost.\n\n[A notable feature though is typing notes on the map!  A feature that I have been wanting for a great deal of time.  Very happy to see this in a game.]\n\nSo, It's linear then, right?  A bit, but you get a good sense of freedom from one simple thing.....you don't have to fight.  Sure, the camera suggests that you stay and fight, but you can easily just run past and continue exploring.  Well done.\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nFor the Metroid/Castlevania Enthusiasts, this is not a "Great" game.  But it is fun and worth your time, in my opinion.","September 10, 2014","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You stutter and lose forward momentum, this is awful for a platformer.\n- You die from fall height.  Coupled with the aforementioned jump feeling, this leads to many needless deaths.\n- Attacks have ZERO weight.  The whip cuts through enemies, it's like swinging at nothing.\n- YOU have zero weight.  The movement feels completely unsatisfying and empty.  You neither have the "heavy" movement of a Super Castlevania IV or the "smooth" movement of a Symphony of the Night.\n- The maps are disconnected.  Instead of giving you a big area to explore, you "explore" lots of small ones and move on (simply having a "square-based" map does not make you a metroidvania).\n- The "grab" animations are too long and repetitive.  If that will be your main means of finishing an enemy, you'd better make it fast, or interesting. Instead it's neither.\n\nI can't even use the "well it's a 3DS port" excuse, because there were so many (Igarashi-made) fantastic Castlevania's on GBA/DS.  This development team tried to take THEIR Castlevania and put it in the Igarashi formula and managed to miss every single mark of what made those games so satisfying.","May 13, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I haven't finished it, and I'm probably not going to, so maybe put an asterisk next to everything else I have to say.\n\nThe combat is largely tedious, they pretty much directly ported the combat for lords of shadow into a 2D game, so you have direct attacks that hit a quarter of the screen, and area attacks that do less damage and hit about half of it. Basically you'll be mashing the direct attack button a lot. I'm not sure why they decided to give you a block, considering every almost every attack you run into in the game is unblockable. You can parry normal enemies, but it's almost always simpler to steamroll them by spamming the same combo. The boss battles I played were fairly interesting in comparison, but not enough to redeem it.\n\nI have no idea why there's falling damage in this game. It barely comes up on the first pass, and when I was retracing for hidden items it's a simple matter to restore lost health at a font. It's just an annoyance. The platforming itself wasn't particularly enjoyable either. For the most part it's just moving from magnetic ledge to magnetic ledge, but there are definitely times when it's a trick to get your character to latch onto the chain whip point you want him to, for instance.\n\nThe plot is not very interesting, and frankly the game would be served better by a 1-2 minute scrolling text intro than the voice work and cutscenes it rams in your face.

Well it's not ugly but not incredible. It's an HD rescaling of a 3DS game... easy on the eye, but nothing incredible. Also, it's confined in Dracula's Castle, so there's not that much variety in terms of environment.\n\n- Sound & Musics :\n\nVery good voice acting, musics are alright. Nothing extraordinary though.\n\n- Gameplay :\n\nAgain, it comes from a 3DS game, so it's more barebone than the original Lords of Shadow. It still is kind of nice, although having three campaigns with always the same weapons kinda make sitting through the whole game a bore... and that to me is the biggest problem with this game.\n\n- Storytelling :\n\nI would say it's important to understand the event of LoS 2 if there wasn't a big recap in that last game. It's somewhat interesting... but nothing very motivating.\n\n- Length :\n\nI'd say the length's okay with the three campaigns, but after doing that there's not much else to do : you got the boss rush mode which I never tried because... I didn't really enjoyed any bossfights, they all seemed "meh" to me. On a go I could see the reason for this game's existence, but on PC... well...\n\nCONCLUSION :\n\nYou may want to pass on this one unless you're a big fan of the first LoS game, or maybe take it on sale. As for the full price release, well it's not over expensive for what it is, but I think it's a pretty boring game and, frankly, not that useful in the story department. So I won't recommend it for people who disliked the first LoS game or at full price.","May 26, 2015","false","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Each character has their own light and dark spells.\n\n+ The combat is identical to Lords of Shadow, I really enjoyed the combat system so I felt really at ease getting use to the mechanics again.\n\n+ Collectables to upgrade your character providing incentive to backtrack through previously played levels\n\n+ Boss battles are fun and challenging. Boss designs are really well done.\n\n+ Boss rush mode allows you to fight  every boss back to back.\n\n+ Soundtrack\n\nThe Average:\n\n+ The graphics do look like a 3DS port. The graphics are not bad but low polygons and low res textures hurt the overall look and aesthetic of the game.\n\n+ I found the platforming to be a bit 'floaty'. Jumping near a ledge would automatically place your character on it. It never feels as precise as it be.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis game is not a typical metroidvania game. You play with three separate characters each with their own level layout and the majority of the level layout is linear. Backtracking is only necessary if you want all the collectables. IF you love 2D action platformers, this is a great game to pick up, it is not as polished as other games in the genre but if you can pick this up at discount then I think you will enjoy yourself.\n","December 20, 2015","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I like what they've done with the story elements.  Granted the writing itself in the series is far from amazing, it's kind of interesting in a schlocky dark gothic sense.  Evil awakens, men fight against fate, darkness blah blah blah.\n\nIf you liked the writing / story from either of the LoS games you'll like it here as well.\n\nI'm a Castlevania fan, so for comparison let me lay out my top three faves in the franchise, in no particular order:\n\nSymhpony of the Night, Lords of Shadow 2, and Dracula X Chronicles (a psp remake of Rondo of Blood)\n\nThis goes back to the 2d style of game play which is where Castlevania has found its most success.  But the platforming is very far from perfect, and feels rough at times.  There's a noticeable slump in speed when you jump.  It's off putting, it makes it feel like there's so many gaps you can't make.\n\nYou'll play as three characters in this, Simon Belmont, Alucard, and Trevor Belmont, and all three of them play almost exactly the same with a couple of differences in sub weapons and one character not getting a double jump, and only one character getting a glide.\n\nThey all fight and play exactly the same.  They all use a whip.  I get it with the Belmonts, but with Alucard, here's a character that we all love because of Symphony of the Night and here he is also using a whip and not his signature sword style.  Which is weird, because in his LoS 2 appearance he is using a sword.\n\nAt first I got excited when I got to play as Alucard and then that went away as soon as I started playing as Alucard.  There was no difference in how he played.  In most of the other games your character would get a new power after a boss, but here Alucard gets several new powers right at the beginning of playing and it's just like "Here you go, you can do this now"\n\nAlong those lines, it also bothers me that Simon can air dash.  I know this game is supernatural, but at least with Gabriel, he had magic boots, Simon's introduced as a barbarian, and without magical aid he just dashes in air.  It's weird to me.\n\nThe platforming has these weird difficulty curves.  In most well designed games there's a gradual growth in the difficulty of platforming level design.  Things start out easy then progress, and you find yourself doing things that you couldn't imagine doing early game.\n\nIn this, the majority of the segments are long and simplistic platforming parts, but suddenly the game throws a curve ball at you and hits you with something rough, but because you've spent 85% of the game doing simple gaming, these parts hit hard.\n\nThere were 4 times in this game that I wanted to give up and stop playing (but I make a promise to myself in the last few weeks of summer before I go back to school to actually complete games in my steam library, so no giving up here)\n\nThe third act of the game starts to get more interesting in game play elements, so much so that it makes me think a different production team was behind its development, but then it just ends super fast.\n\nMy account says I took 9.3 hours to finish this game, and I don't plan on a second playthrough.\n\nIt's just not a good game and I didn't have fun playing it.\n\nI wouldn't pay more than $5 for this.  I think I bought it on sale around $7.50, and that's just a little too much.

The tone and atmosphere make up for this somewhat.\n\nThe game design is such that you spend too much time backtracking through a cumbersome very vertical layout with many loading screens.\n\nUnfortunately I found the combat to be oddly clumsy.  Your weapon doesn't feel like it has any weight to it and it takes often a half dozen to a dozen hits to kill simple enemies.  Each enemy opponent can be dealt with almost in exactly the same way -- hit it until it retaliates and then vault backwards.  This is especially true because of how frequently enemies throw unblockable attacks.  The counter mechanic is basic and effective, but largely useless because of spammed unblockable attacks.\n\nThe boss battles are a saving grace, with real variety and difficulty.  However, you will often be hit by huge hotboxes thrown out constantly.  The gimmick I found the most irritating is lots of invincibility for the bosses, not only are you contending with their regular attacks and abilities being thrown out, but long moments of invulnerability where you basically engage in a mini game where your floaty character avoids giant hitboxes.\n\nThis game would heavily benefit from more polished combat and movement.  Moving a tall, floaty character around wide slow projectiles and slow telegraphed attack patterns can often feel frustrating and unrewarding.","February 26","false","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After exploring the mixed reception to this game, I think I figured it out:\n\nPeople either wanted more of "Lords of Shadow" or more "Symphony of the Night". What you get with this game is an excellent mix of the original, NES Castlevania style, "Lords of Shadow", AND "Symphony of the Night". It has a lot of combat elements from "Lords of Shadow" in it (but not quite as complex, which is good), as well as many of the creature designs. It has a slight Metroidvania structure to it, but not quite as open as "Symphony of the Night" - fusing it with a slightly more linear style from the original NES games.\n\nJudged as its own game, without any expectations getting in the way, it was a very enjoyable play (I just finished playing it my second time through, so it was a good enough game to bring me back). I suppose I'll try it on a harder difficulty or attempt the boss rush mode next. A pretty good story, too.\n\nAs far as true flaws go, there are some minor control issues, I found. Slightly stiff/slow. Nothing compared to the stiffness and slowness of the original NES games, of course.\n\nThis is one of my favourites, and I find that I enjoy playing more than its predecessor. While "Lords of Shadow" is impressive in many ways, I think it mostly comes down to the fact that "Mirror of Fate" doesn't suffer from the staccato breakup of levels and chapters that "Lords of Shadow" does. You can lose yourself in a larger, continuous environment.\n\n****","March 17","true","79.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It took me about 8 hours to run through this game on the hard difficulty while ferreting out 100% of the secrets, and it would have taken about 3-4 otherwise. The combat is rarely that challenging, and the bosses were pretty good, but not that challenging barring 2 or 3 of them.\n\nAt the time of this review the price for this game is $14.99 and I would recommend picking it up, albeit with a tad of hesitance. I don't regret the purchase, but I feel like this is more of a $10 game.","February 8","true","11.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The series has never done terribly well in its forays into the third dimension and even though this game is technically 2D it falls into all of the same pitfalls that Lords of Shadow does.\n\nWhat pitfalls are those? It wants desperately to be God of War. That's a problem because I don't like much God of War either.\n\nBoth games suffer from a series of major issues. They have dull combat with mushy, impactless attacks that just kind of wave a fan at the enemy until they either get cooled off enough to have a lie down and nap off a hard days being wooshed, or until they flash to arbitrarily signal its time to do a quicktime event, or push a button and watch something intended to be gruesome happen to them.\n\nThose events are already a bit tedious to me but you throw in Mirror of Fate's lackluster visuals, amateurish presentation, schizophrenic camera that will give you motion sickness and generally humdrum design and you've got yourself a crappy Castlevania game.\n\nThe movement is floaty and imprecise, grabbale ledges which are already a big no-no to Castlevania are magnetized and suck you in, you break barrels instead of candles, your attacks are whiffy and weak feeling, dodging has no iframes that I could see, blocking is rarely useful as 75% of attacks are unblockable, and navigation feels like they just give the illusion of free roaming much of the time.\n\nPerhaps I'm simply not the target audience, and I know I haven't gotten very far into the game yet but I'm extremely disatisfied with it. If I hadn't gotten this on sale for $3 from GamersGate I'd probably feel ripped off. I realize it's a port of a port of a 3DS game but the game itself is just not terribly appealing. If you're a fan of the oldschool Castlevanias ranging from the NES entrants to Symphony of the Night (which I still play through once almost every year) to the last decent release in Harmony of Dissonance, this is probably not going to whip your torches.","February 8","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is epic!!! An amazing experience with breathtaking graphics and a solid story.
