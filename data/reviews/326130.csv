"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/recommended/326130/","chudah","Chudah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chudah/","1693 products in account","Monument Builders: Alcatraz is one of several entries in a series of time management games based on famous historical landmarks.  The game has you gathering materials and ordering the conversion of Alcatraz from a military to federal prison while fighting off notorious "Call Palone's" henchmen.  It's an enjoyable entry in the genre despite a few issues.\n\nGameplay is pretty standard; direct workers to build, repair and collect resources while removing obstacles as you rush to beat the clock and earn a 3 star rating for each level.  If you're not interested in the drive for perfection and want to play more casually, you're given more than enough time to finish with 2 or less stars, but going for all three is where the gameplay is most engaging.  Added into the mix are gangster henchmen that you'll need to beat up to stop them from blocking supply routes, burglars that steal your resources if you don't drive them off in time, and stubborn pelicans demanding food before they'll let your resource wagons through.  Juggling all of these can be a challenge at times, but that's the fun of it.\n\nUnfortunately, the tuning of play is such that purchasable power-ups are all but required to win you those 3 stars, and yet to get the gems to purchase said power-ups you need to earn stars in previous stages which award them.  While this in itself isn't a huge issue as you can replay lower stages multiple times and farm up your gems, it can be a bit boring going back to the beginning to grind when I'd really rather work through the rest of the game.  To avoid this as much as possible, I would often play through each stage once or twice without any power-ups at all, form a strategy, then replay it again fully powered and aim for gold.\n\nA neat little addition is the trivia tidbits between each level.  I didn't know a ton about Alcatraz before playing the game, but now have a healthy bit of anecdotal knowledge of its history, most of which is pretty interesting.  It's a nice touch that helps distinguish the series from the many other games in the genre.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed Monument Builders: Alcatraz.  While the game difficulty could have been tuned a little better, it's still a fun time waster in between more serious gaming.  Steam Achievements or trading cards would have added a bit of value to the package, but if you can find it on sale or bundled at a good price, it's worth a look for those who enjoy more casual fair now and again.\n\nBottom Line: Recommended for those who enjoy time management gaming with a bit more challenge added in.\n\nNote - This game was provided by the developer with the request to write an informative review.","April 9, 2015","true","2.1"," 77 of 79 people (97%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","97","77","79","4","7"

The graphics are old but work, the controls are a little clunky, and the cheat system is odd. I presume it's a remnant from a mobile implementation. I got bored quickly and put it aside, and for that reason I can't recommend it.","February 10, 2015","false","0.7"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

No real challenge - as the mechanics are to simple.\nThe genre of casual strategy game was new to me - and i will furthermore prefer "normal" strategy games\n\nFor the nice presentation and the historical anecdotes i would still recommend it to everyone who wants to learn something about alkatraz or something easy to master.","December 2, 2015","true","5.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"
