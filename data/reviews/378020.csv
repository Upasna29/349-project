I don't even remember reserving a copy for it on WGN (Which distributed free keys for the game today). Whatever, I guess I'll play this game and I guess I'll see how it is.\n\nI stopped after 5 minutes.\n\nNow before you can go at me and be like "Niko you little **** you're just here so you can review bomb the game", hear me out.\n\nI tried to join a match of Protocol, and was bumped into a server with aboslutely 0 people. We're off to a good start here. The map is so damn huge, it looks like a mess of Unity Asset packs, and the whole map looks ugly as hell. This game is basically a Unity Asset pack, and nothing else is done to make the game even remotely playable (or fun). There's no reloading mechanic (Or even any way to get additional ammo), wallrunning and scaling walls likes to make you fly in the air in ridiculous directions, and the map is just a buggy mess. I basically fell out of the map because collision detection isn't even a thing, like what the hell? This is like the one time where invisible walls would probably make my experience for the game less bitter.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=508682076\n\nWhen making Early Access games, you want to make sure that your game is actually in a somewhat playable state. This isn't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, the best Early Access games (And the ones that successfully walk out of it) are ones that were playable from the start (And has enough content to justify the price) and expand based off of player feedback. Darkest Dungeon is a fantastic example of this.\n\nYou know this product will be a mess when it's version is 0.0.1, and you should probably stay away from it. This crap can't be excused. You don't release the earliest build of ANY game on a storefront and ask for money, that's not even remotely excusable! Even less so when the game is being built with nothing but Unity Asset Packs. Somebody call Jim Sterling!\n\nSo here's my message to the developer: Start making games with real quality, with your own effort/talent, or get out of the industry while you still can.","August 29, 2015","false","0.1"," 42 of 54 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","42","54","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/iTs_VaLiuM/recommended/378020/","iTs_VaLiuM","VaLiuM","http://steamcommunity.com/id/iTs_VaLiuM/","882 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nReview Update 10.10.2015\nAfter waiting 1 whole month, i decided to report the game as being broken for one reason:\nIt is online only, means without masterserver connection, you can't play the game, you'll only see the main menu and are able to click options, that's all.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=532733801\n\nPlease do not waste your money on this one, it doesn't allow you to play!\nHere it comes, a short and basic review but you should treat it more like an overview\n\nAt first the features that are not included yet, despite being advertised:\n- Destructible buildings. (Couldn't find anything that could have been destroyed, wasting several ammo rounds on different buildings)\n- A large amount of maps available. (There is 1)\n- Game altering time periods. (There is only 1 too and definitely not 2070!)\n\nPro's\n- Parkour, basic animations and functions like climbing, jumping, sliding, there is crouching too\n- Dedicated server\n- Performance isn't bad (but the game not that demanding either) maybe because there are no textures anywhere\n\nCon's\n- No game modes\n- There are no players, you spawn alone because nobody is playing the game, there aren't any bots, only you and your shadow\n- There is only 1 (one) (!) map right now, the City\n- Picked up ammo respawns every 15 seconds, so you can pick it up again, stand there all day long collecting ammo, until the round is over because nothing else can be done yet\n- Every time you spawn you'll have 10% health remaining, the funny thing is, there is no health spawns anywhere on the map so you could heal and where are the other 90%?\n- There is a main menu where you can set up basic stuff but once in the game, you can't even get out anymore because there is no Exit button anywhere! You have to close/force close the whole game and restart it to get into another match\n- Graphic settings don't do anything, except the Resolution and Fullscreen toggle. Means AA, Dynamic Adaption, not even the FPS counter work.\n- They removed 3rd person view for some unknown reason from the game, you can see it featured in the store video, right? The output_log.txt from the engine gets spammed with that info and can easily grow to 3 MB in size after a single game, which made the game crash for me upon exit\n- Only 3 weapon types, a pistol, a automatic rifle and a shotgun, that's it\n- You don't take any damage from falling, there the 10% health make sense, somehow\n- Shadow only applies to the player, the equipped weapon is missing in the shadow?\n\nAlso, did i mention already? There are no other players anywhere, you spawn completely alone most of the time, i never met another player yet!\n\nI don't know what i have done in this game, pretty much nothing.\n\nBut i have a answer to the question i asked myself after installing the game, the company behind it has the name Prototype Games for this very reason it seems, they make prototype games and that's all what you will see here right now, a prototype, nothing more.\n\nWhat it really needs, ASAP\n- Bots should be included, so you could play without real people joining into a map (and then it is not totally wasted to rent a dedicated server where nobody is playing on)\n- More equipment would be nice (grenades ?, smoke bombs ?)\n- Needs more maps\n- Game needs textures\n- Proper ingame menu required\n\nIt needs a lot of work but the most important thing may be a proper Exit button for the game, people will need and use it, i'd assume.\n\nAnyway, i don't really see this game going anywhere anytime soon and it never should have been put up on the store for sale because there is nothing in the game right now that justifies others paying money for it and 9€ for nothing more than a empty map is TOO MUCH.\n\nReview Update 10.09.2015\nAfter some updates i decided to give a smaller review update.\n\nThere are no official changelogs whatsoever, it is a guessing-game every time what's been added, changed, fixed, like:\n\n- Textures have now been added\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=515748295\n\n- Performance improved (after adding the textures, it was really bad)\n\n- Options menu can now be accessed ingame\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=515748333\n\n- Doge after devlogo added with some weird voice-acting (dead babies...something)\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=515749003\n\n- New jump sounds added, weirdly voice-acted aswell ("i thought i stand the jump"...or whatever)\n\nThere are lots of clipping, collision and glitch issues right now, you will find many spots where you can clip thru walls, roofs, other textures and fall thru the map and die, which counts as deficit for your team, you actually get punished for those issues and you can aswell make your character stuck almost everywhere, even in situation where you wouldn't expect it but the game hub's screenshot area is full of it but anyway, some of it...\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=515749419\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=515749361\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=515749454\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=515756574\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=515756622\n\nThey try. :trolol:","August 29, 2015","false","1.9"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","21","26","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/recommended/378020/","Official_KwS","KidwithSmurf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Official_KwS/","827 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nUPDATE - Just Tweeted Prototype Games and got this response: http://prntscr.com/8b9eio\n\nLatest Update:\n♦ Removed DOGE and Dead Babies reference from Intro\n♦ Turned Off Servers (Game is NOT playable again!)\n______________________________________________\nSince my review:\n♦ They've added a picture of DOGE in the intro and a soundclip stating the Devs like "DEAD BABIES" (What even is this? If it's supposed to be funny, it's not...)\n♦ Added derogatory sound effects like when you Jump it says "Jump Fat ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Jump"... recently changed it to an annoying "Jump for the Baby" after the Fat Community complained.\n♦ They've turned on the servers again (This is seemingly good, but I don't know if they work as no-one plays the game)\n♦ They've removed Credit tabs (This is dodgy as it only proves they don't want credits going out to who made the game)\n\nNow that the server works:\n♦ You spawn inside darkness and can't see until you find your way out\n♦ You only have limited ammo - once you run out you are out\n♦ Jumping from small heights kills you\n♦ Graphics shadows suck as there are black patches everywhere\n♦ Always getting stuck on walls\n♦ Ultimately I chased someone round the map unloaded the 5 magazines from the 5 weapons we get on him and he didn't die.\n♦ Resolution Issue still stays (Resolution doesn't fit my computer screen and I can't change it)\n________________________________________\nMy Review:\n\nAnother unity greenlight ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t where someone who doesn't know anything about game making thought they could release a non-working game, give a few cd-keys out free and make a quick buck. This is Into The War all over again. Do not waste your money, do not buy this and do report this game ASAP.\n\nFirstly before I get into the review, I want to say three things:\n\n1. The Company is a Fraud (Making us pay for a game that the Devs knowingly know doesn't work, Stole the name ProtoType Games from Prototype series, has paid for Facebook likes on their latest status - has 30k likes on their latest status but only 2k likes on their Facebook Page)\n2. The Company is Stealing and Knowingly Scamming people (Making you pay for something that ultimately doesn't work)\n3. The Company makes you sign an EULA which you can't see or read\n\nNow onto the review. The game is that badly made that I shouldn't have to list any Pros and Cons but I'm going to just to give you an idea of just how terrible this game is.\n\nPros:\n♦ Has a nice Graphics Setting Menu to an extent (See Cons to find out why it's only to an extent)\n\nCons:\n♦ I got this game for free on WGN when I don't even remember signing up for it, that's how desperate the DEVS are to get people to play it.\n♦ Launching the game requires Agreement to 3rd Party EULA for no reason (Also the EULA states: There was an error loading the content of this EULA. Meaning you can't see what you are agreeing too... Kinda fraudulent behaviour there)\n♦ States on opening it's made with Unity (This is okay, but it's a good way to tell you to boycott the game as 90% of Unity games are devs who think they can make a quick 1 day game to make a quick dollar).\n♦ Advertises there logo for ages before the game starts\n♦ Calls themselves Prototype Games (This is fraudulent to the Prototype Series which actually has a website registered as: http://www.prototypegame.com/)\n♦ Changing Resolution doesn't work properly (Made the game way too big for my monitor, I couldn't see the apply button to re-apply a smaller resolution size and I couldn't get it back to fullscreen)\n♦ Main Menu is just an advertisement for their YouTube, Twitter and Facebook\n♦ There are no Credits even though there is a credit tab (The company have purchased the Assets for the game and forget to edit in a credits, so the credit tab says "Credit Example - Lorem ipsum etc")\n♦ There is only one map and one mode (The map has no picture preview)\n♦ The server is dead so the game doesn't work from the start\n♦ Achievements don't work as you can't play the game\n♦ Way expensive for something that doesn't even work\n\nOverall, this company "ProtoType Games" has stolen their name from the Prototype Series, makes you sign an EULA that you can't read, is paying for likes on Facebook and is ultimately making you pay for a Game that the Devs know doesn't even work. Basically boycott this game, report it for FRAUD on the way out and have a nice day knowing you didn't play this game.","August 30, 2015","false","0.9"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","17","22","0","22"

I was stunned by the high framerates, beautiful graphics, and godly gun mechanics. I strafed through the dark map with my eyes beggining to bleed, jumping from wall to wall with the 'maizin parkour abilities of my character. I must say this game saved me forever and I will now know I can never leave PC gaming or else I will miss this gorgeously built game.\n\n10/10 -IGN","September 2, 2015","true","0.2"," 14 of 65 people (22%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","22","14","65","27","1"

Definitely avoid this one.","September 10, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
