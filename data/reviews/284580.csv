It reminds me alot of orcs must die, so those of you who enjoyed that game will definitly enjoy this.\n\nTHe gameplay is fast paced and fun, youre always active during the game even when you seting up trap in between waves. There's also a decent vaiety of power ups and torrents, so your never really stuck using the same old traps. the power ups and torrents are upgradeable so that extra boost in power/range/life, will also just make things alot easier to win. Online gameplay for this game will come at a later day, but judging based on the single player and co-op, this game is definitly worth buying.\n\nIf you are looking for the next fresh game on the market then I highly recommend this once its a fair price for what you get and the developers did say that they will be updating the game every week with new stages , maybe some more power-ups and torrents, and online gameplay so you can play with your friends.","April 13, 2014","true","54.9"," 29 of 32 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","29","32","0","0"

The devs are gone. Don't buy it.\n\nIt was a nice idea with fresh gameplay and ...ah who cares, you can't even really play it because of broken mechanics.\n\nUsually i don't do bad reviews, but seeing people still wishlisting it: DON'T.","August 9, 2015","false","0.8"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","14","15","0","6"

Biomutant Extermination is an interesting concept of tower defence and isometric brawler or shooter mechanics thrown into one, with a whacky and vibrant comical theme to it. The game is currently said to contain around a third of all content that will be available on the full release according to the developer, but it is highly playable and feels fairly complete outside of the lack of levels.\n\nHowever, it has some serious tightening up to do in terms of the mechanics, because while it presents a fantastic idea, it simply becomes a chore to play due to the poor combat and frustrating AI. I certainly recommend ZAMB! Biomutant Extermination as something you keep your eye on, because what is there is fairly promising, but from what I’ve seen, it’s nothing more than promise due to its fundamental technical issues. If they were improved, I would have a much easier time recommending it, but as it stands, I’d say hold off until significant improvements are made.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRtd-gehwI0\n\nHopefully some of you will find the video preview to be more helpful as I demonstrate the pros and cons of ZAMB! Biomutant Extermination. :)","June 8, 2014","true","2.4"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

I havent played coop mode yet. Its easy to change character thru "TAB" while playing but this can be very nice to play in coop mode since the AI aint playing as you want him to every time. Archivement makes its great to replay and get all the stars after you upgraded your gears to clear the level perfect..\nYou can chose what power or turret to upgrade and reset everything if you made a wrong choice. Its great that you dont have to start all over just because you made some wrong choice.\nI seems to get back to earlier levels just to kill them perfectly to get all stars when im a bit OP for that level.","June 24, 2014","true","4.5"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

The two character types aren't even remotely balanced.  My brothers sound wouldn't work when we first tried playing.  Game is glitchy as hell.  Had to reset 25+ times from getting warped into the walls and being stuck inside of them.  I've fallin through the world to my death.  The creatures fall through the world but somehow can still kill the reactors.  Being able to put two towers on a bonus spot.  Throwing a bomb perfictly on the creatures, only to have it do zero damage to the creatures and take 3/4 of my life.  I can't believe I wasted 98 minutes of my life on this, i'm sure 30+ were troubleshooting my brothers sound issues.  Can I get a refund?","May 9, 2015","false","1.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Not just because the sound wouldn't work without having to manually install openal after none of the forum support applied to my issue.  The two characters are horribly unbalanced with one building turrets and the other just getting abilities that cost resources but are one-shot uses.  I played primarily in two player co-op, and the frist 3 levels my co-op partner kept getting knocked off the world or trapped inside walls.  Horrible.  Playing co-op with a camera angle that makes me want to beg someone for the ability to adjust it myself vs the horrible angles it picks.  It's too bad in this day and age two people playing a game together on the internet are stuck feeling like they are sharing a tv in an old nintendo multiplayer game.  After 96 minutes, I've deleted it and will never re-install it.  I love TD games, and TD games with hero characters, but this one is the worst I've ever played.  Would not recommend to anyone that is serious about a good tower defence game.","May 9, 2015","false","1.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

I play with a controler so far and it's awesome. Great game to play with a buddy. Nothing too complicated but challenging nonetheless. I also got it at a great price during the summer sale. Worth every penny.\n\nUPDATE: I stopped playing a while back as it seems the Devs have abandoned the game to it's fate. More support and content would have had me play for a long while.","July 2, 2014","true","2.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

In solo mode gameplay is shared with an AI. The AI intelligence is basic but fortunately won’t always just run to it’s death.\n\nGraphics and Sound nothing spectacular but not bad\n\nYou take control of one or alternate between two characters. One character is a melee caster. While the other character has a ranged attack and places turrets. You unlock and upgrade powers and turrets as you go.\n\nSurprisingly I found that from a relatively early stage the gameplay can be a challenging. You need to simultaneously defend multiple targets in different locations from waves of enemies. Which requires strategy. Combination of turret types and placement matters.\n\nIt’s fun. You can probably get a substantial amount stimulating game time out it. I’ll be optimistic and say it’ probably enough to make it worth the price.\n\nClick here for more let’s play videos =)","June 21, 2014","true","1.9"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","2"
