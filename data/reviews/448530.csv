Squares route is an indie game that has rather cool concept and makes you exercise your brain. It has controller support and simple stuff like resolutions etc.\nHowever i do think mouse support would be nice for clearer gameplay (for lazy people too)\n\nThere is ton of difficulty as you progress throughout the game, even if you complete all 100 levels you can still beat them with 3 star rating. Plus the game is not expensive or anything so might as well give it a shot","May 1","true","1.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","5","5","4","0"

It is colorful, has great graphics, relatively simple, and cheap. The puzzles are easy at first, but they do get harder as one progresses. I also like the catchy music in the background. The one thing I did not like is that you cannot look at the entire world map, which means that without reading the description in the Store Page I had no clue how many levels the game contained. All in all, I recommend this for puzzle lovers who want a cheap and enjoyable experience.","March 21","true","0.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

No chance!\n\nThankfully, the difficulty curve steps up gradually, eventually becoming rock hard, through the introduction of limited moves, different coloured sides which must be used to squish matching coloured plants, mined explosives, time limits, porcupine cubes that take you out along with other guard sentries etc.\n\nGameplay and controls (arrow keys) are really easy to pick up, but as each level becomes more and more intricate, you need to carefully plan and experiment to solve.  Getting past the next level feels really rewarding, while the pop synth soundtrack is also great addition.  Can't recommend this game more highly!","March 23","true","0.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Pushed me on spatial thinking anticipating how to get the correct side of a cube at the correct location.  A 1-cell Rubik's cube!\n\nI appreciate how you can make any level more challenging by going for additional challenges, or you can just complete the level and move on.\n\nI hope there is a sequel","May 28","true","33.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Simple, fast, fluid and fun. So gald to find that it's now available on steam, big surprise! Love the look and feel of the game, reminds me of some classic nintendo games, of old. Simply hooked on the simple mechanics, trying to get prefect on some of the later levels is keeping me in the game.

This continues throughout the game, thanks to lots of warm-hearted animations and little background flourishes that breathe life into the environment.\n\nThe music perfect matches the gameplay, it seems to get you into a puzzle solving rhythm and spur you along. Sound effects are well rounded and never annoying.\n\nI liked the purity of the control mechanic. The challenges posed by the game purely come from the playful and challenging level design.  This makes it easy to pickup which maxmises its potential audience.  So many games get this wrong and end up complicating the controls (e.g. multiple action buttons) which just puts players off from the start.\n\nWhat addicted me most was trying to get a perfect score. I was never satisfied with simply completing a level, I felt the need to prove myself to the game by sussing out the optimal route!\n\nOne of the puzzle themes is ensuring you use specific coloured sides of the cube to squash some enemies. This is nice as it gets you thinking spatially in 3 dimensions which feels like a mini-workout for the brain.\n\nThe whole experience is rounded off with nice soft damped player and camera motions.","April 15","true","0.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You still only move the joystick up down left or right, even though your block ends up moving diagonally. Other than that the music is great and the game is a lot of fun.","March 18","true","0.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","3","5","2","0"
