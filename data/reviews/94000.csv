"http://steamcommunity.com/id/darthkorig/recommended/94000/","darthkorig","Korig","http://steamcommunity.com/id/darthkorig/","643 products in account","Dinner Date is a very short indie title about a man waiting for his date to arrive and I ♥♥♥♥ing hated it.\n\nThe main reason I hated this game was mainly due to the usual false expectations scenario. Rather than just completely rip this game apart let me explain what I thought the game was going to be, and then what the game actually is.\n\nWhat I thought Dinner Date was going to be:\n\nEverything I thought this game was going to be came from what people posted about on the internet. Nothing I am writing in this section is what I hoped the game would be, this is what I expected based on others experiences with it. Like I mentioned above, this is a game about a man waiting for his date to arrive at his house. However, I was under the assumption that this would be 1st person, without any narration, and you are completely free to do whatever you want while you wait for the date. You do not know who the date is, or why this man is possibly being stood up. Maybe this is him being dumped, maybe he murdered her, maybe he doesn’t have a date and he’s lonely, we just don’t know. While waiting for your possible date to arrive, you are free to do whatever you want in your apartment. Doing actions will affect the outcome of “The Date”. Maybe you could eat your entire meal before he/she shows up, would that have an effect? Maybe if you drink the whole bottle of wine you will pass out and miss the date entirely, never knowing if the person came by or not. Maybe you could just sit there and wait the entire time, twiddling your thumbs, eagerly watching the clock. Maybe you could just ♥♥♥♥ing kill yourself, the point is what sold me on this game was mystery. Every time I looked into this game online, for whatever reason, the game was completely shrouded in mystery, and this made me want to play the game so badly. I was honestly expecting to play this game multiple times just to see what else I could make happen. There could’ve been so many possibilities, so many outcomes, but as you can guess I ended up being tremendously disappointed.\n\nWhat Dinner Date actually is:\n\nA monologue. The game is literally just a monologue disguised as a video game. If there are any David Cage fanboys reading this, buy this game right now. NOTHING you do while you “wait” for you date matters. I only played this game once and I went in with the intention of killing my character through alcohol abuse, but even though I am drinking down a glass of wine every 5 seconds, the character doesn’t shut up…even while he is drinking. You are forced to listen to this guy whine and complain and there’s nothing you can do about it. Yeah, there are actions, but they are ♥♥♥♥ing meaningless. I’m pretty sure if someone smoked 47 cigarettes in a row he would maybe cough a few times in the middle of his ♥♥♥♥♥ing. The game kept giving me hope that something good would happen. Oh look! He’s getting up! Can I jump out the window? Nope. Can I open my fridge? Nope. Well, can I grab that endless bottle of wine again? Not right now, nope. When I realized that I could just sit back and the game would play itself I decided to stick through to the end, with the hope that maybe something interesting would happen, but of course not. You listen to this guy whine and complain about life for awhile and then that’s it, it just ends. He doesn’t kill himself (sadly), the date never shows up, nothing ♥♥♥♥ing happens. The best part about the uh experience is the torture is short. My game time for this is 23 minutes and I waiting till the credits ended.\n\nSo that’s it, I can’t even recommend this game to people who enjoy monologues, or hearing sad..ish life stories. Rather that waste your time listening to this guys issue’s you could go hang out with your friends, and maybe help them with their problems. I can promise in that situation different outcomes and functionality that makes an impact, I dare you to try and drink as much wine as I did in this game while hearing your friend talk. In other words, real life is more of a video game than Dinner Date.","November 25, 2013","false","0.4"," 181 of 220 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","181","220","3","2"

If offered me an experience I never had before and I probably never will have. I had so many feelings come over me. I felt the amazing feeling of having a date. I felt the horible feeling of someone not showing up to the date. It simulated real life perfectly. I'm glad I played this game before going on a real life date. If I ever feel lonley in by bedroom in the dark with the blinds closed then I can just play dinner date and feel the sensation of having a date. Then I will feel the depressing feeling of having my date not show up. In conclusion, this game is the best game I have played since Lunch date simulatior.

Soon you will ask yourself: "Why am I playing? What where they thinking?" And the story will fully get you. I was shocked when he brutally murdered that slice of bread by dipping it in the sauce until it was drawn. I can hear it scream in my nightmares. But that was only the start. He uses some kind of Magic device to reverse the time and let the slice of bread suffer again and again while he murder him and his Son Bread,his Daughter Bread and his Wife bread. And it goes on, He lightens an innocent Cigarette! And draws all of his life by sucking on it. What is wrong with this guy? Why is he in such a Murder Rampage? Nobody will know! And it ends with an Cliff Hangar, he goes out of his House. What will come next? Will he clomp over innocent sidewalks? Will he buy a donut and eat it while the family of Daddy donut has to watch this? I cannot tell you. But someone who drawn innocent bread is able to do anything!\nThis game needs a second part the next episode should be called "Dinner Date Rampage of Julian Luxemburg"\nI would recommend this game but the Story about a man who has tortured slice of bread to death is to much for me. So you better play something more innocent with less violence.

You'll see what he sees and hear his thoughts as he waits for his date and you'll push keys. The key prompts float in little bubbles that have hints about what they'll do. Different keys do different things. You'll get to pour a glass of wine, look at the clock, check your left hand and gaze at your right hand. There are even such details like putting your spoon into soup, stirring it, put the spoon back down and so on. You'll hear the character talk, basically telling you which of the things to do next.\n\nGoing into the game I thought it would be another 'crazy hand simulator' like Surgeon Simulator or Ampu-Tea. Nope, you just press keys to do things when the prompts are up.\n\nYou have no control over movement or the camera, just over what the character does as he continues to worry about his date. He will wonder whether to drink another glass of wine and what else he could be doing. The dinner date is a quick experience, over in about 30 minutes. Trying to replay it again didn't lead me to think that there are different outcomes.\n\nDinner Date has a lot going for it, the voice acting is good, the environment is great, but its just a small kitchen with a table in it. You'll go to the window to have a cigarette, but that's it. This could be the demo of a bigger more detailed game, there is talent here, but I just didn't have fun playing the game. Plus there's not much here to get excited about. Its over quick. If a bobbing camera gets you motion sick, avoid this game.\n\nHere's something to think about when telling a story. If its not the most interesting thing that happens to the character,  why aren't you telling the more interesting story? Is it technical limitations such as having characters to interact with? Is this what leads the character up to his suicide or finding his true love after the game has ended? Is it witty banter amongst two characters blended with subconscious thought? No, but maybe that will happen in Dinner Date 2: The Reckoning. I'm sure that Luke Skywalker had moments where he just chilled in his bedroom thinking about a girl. That never made it into Star Wars.\n\nDinner Date was just watching something while I mash all keys at once since there's no sort of right or wrong. Other narrative experiences like Dear Esther and Gone Home at least give you movement control and environments to explore. Like the plot of Dinner Date, it stands in a category all its own.","November 4, 2014","false","0.5"," 43 of 51 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","43","51","0","0"

Dinner Date tho, is one of the worst 5 dollars i have spent.\n\nIts a shame, because the concept is interesting, and to be honest i like the idea of it, putting the player in the mind of a character and being able to see his thoughts is intriguing. The problem is, there is little value or reason to be paying 5 bucks for this. Its over in about 15 minutes. 15 MINUTES. When games like Heavy Rain do these types of games, they give a good long narrative. Or even a telltale episode, you get 2 hours of story content for 5 dollars. Here, you stay in a room, and pick thoughts. Then it ends.\n\nThis could have been an interesting demo for free, that could be an interesting mechanic in story based games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/psychomantis108/recommended/94000/","psychomantis108","Ketojan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/psychomantis108/","236 products in account","This game is the biggest pile of pretentious tripe I've ever played, this is coming from someone who's favourite experience from a video game was Dear Esther.\n\nSay what you like about Dear Esther but the point of it was that it was following the inner thoughts of a suicidally depressed man as we got some insight on loss, pain, depression and regret and what does Dinner Date offer us? The Inner thoughts of a boring, pretentious pillock, who's whining because nobody wants to bugger him.\n\nI'm serious, this whole game is just a man, sat at a table, whining because he can't get laid and the worst part is that he has no redeeming qualities. He's racist, narcissistic, boring and full of crap. There is NOTHING worth investing yourself in, it's not even funny boring, it's just boring.\n\nYou could honestly get the same experience by going to your kitchen table and sitting there for twenty or so minutes, like you're waiting for a date, listening to a pod cast on the colour baige the entire time. There, you've played Dinner Date, except you can actually eat the food and turn off the podcast.\n\nSo, why haven't I spoken about the gameplay? Because there is none! Again, Dear Esther, you can walk around and look at stuff, listen to the monologue or enjoy the scenery. Here, there's NOTHING! You can interact with things, sure but only when the game tells you that it's okay to, otherwise you just hover your hand over it, like you're thinking about doing it. The game even tells you that you aren't in control and you're the character's subconscious, making this no more of a game than one of those College Humour POV videos, except those are funny and often relatable, whereas this is just garbage.\n\nYou have dozens of options presented to you, whilst you listen to the insightful inner thoughts of the loathesome protagonist and all that I was able to do was dip bread into a sauce and eat it. Although, I will say that I did find one thing in common with this guy, we were both incredibly bored and clock watching, throughout the experience.\n\nThe visuals look like ♥♥♥♥, I'm by no means a graphics snob but if you're going to force us to look at something for half an hour at least make it look realistic/nice or at least give it its own style like Facade. But no, this looks like a PS2 game that has gone through a dishwasher, it looks really shoddy.\n\nThe final thing I have to say is that everything about this game is still pretentious, despite the fact that it offers NOTHING, it acts like it's high art. It constantly has the div recite poetry with classical music playing in the background, whilst he goes on about how Japanese girls can't hold their liquor and how he can't wait for his date to show up so he can shag her. Bugger off Dinner Date, just bugger off.\n\nDuring the hit list- I mean... credits, my eyes were drawn to the list of the cast and crew and bugger me backwards...\nTry thinking up the most pretentious pseudonym you can, make it sound french and artsy like: Don Panthane Do Blur or some ♥♥♥♥ like that. Because the credits is full of those names, it's so full of it.\n\nDon't buy this. If I had a physical copy of this game, I would've taken it out back and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ on it.

It would be a lot more interesting if our actions were meaningful to the story, and not a choice of what we eat first, or which side our character looks at, etc. So no, I cannot recommend this game, but I don't think it was a waste of time, as it is a short experimental game, and I enjoy fresh concepts.

I can't in all honesty recommend this game.\n\nLong Review\nThis is basically like watching a movie from the person in the movie's perspective but with the added ability of being able to change the camera angle and get the main (and only) character to perform very limited subconscious actions, that have no apparent affect on the movie. You look out through the narrator's eyes as he sits at home waiting for a dinner date and listen to his thoughts. Whilst I found the dialog well written this was pretty much like sitting and watching a short film rather than playing a game.\n\nI'd guess the game lasts approximately 15-20 minutes.\n\nProsInteresting dialog\nShort gameplayConsNo apparent control over the game\nShort gameplayMarks Out Of 5\n5) Must have - stop whatever you're playing now and play this\n4) Worth the asking price and considering as your next purchase\n3) Maybe purchase if you're stuck for choosing your next game or mildly discounted\n2) Only purchase if it is heavily discounted1) Not worth getting even if given away free\n\nWhere I got the game from\nI purchased the game as part of the   Groupees Mind Bender Bundle[groupees.com] tier one which cost $1 for three games so technically the game cost me $0.33.\n\nPlatform Played On\nIntel Pentium G3258 Anniversary Edition, 8Gb RAM, Palit GTX 750, Windows 10, Standard Mouse & Keyboard.\n\nMy best guess for a PEGI rating\n16 : Mainly due to the langauge used.

That is to say, loading it up and playing it doesn't expose you to anything you might consider gameplay. It is an intellectual experiment, trying to create art from a gaming perspective. Unfortunately what comes out is something that is so pretentious it seems to have been sucked through it's own rear end and into a completely different reality.\n\nNow, if this was a free to download and try experiment at merging gaming and art I probably would be more positive towards it. But this is a priced experience, you don't simply get to try something new, you have to pay for it. And you don't get much for your money.\n\nYou play as Julian Luxemburg, or rather, as his subconscious as he sits around, nervously waiting for his date to arrive, you get to hear his inner monologue, fidget with the various items on the table and drum your fingers a bit. And that's really it, that's the entire experience. The subtle differences that can occur from taking different actions are so minute that it's hardly worth a second playthrough.\n\nOnly bright side to this experience is the above average voice acting of Julian but that alone doesn't add much.\n\nAll in all, this is quite simply a travesty. I am all for game developers experimenting and trying new things but when you are charging me money for 10 minutes of listening to someone worry about life that's just attempting to cash in on the bizarreness of your creation. Do not buy this, it is not worth your time and even if you're into this sort of art, there are much better experiences outside of the gaming medium.","June 12, 2013","false","100.1"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","0"

Dinner Date is a game that isn't for everyone; some might not enjoy the concept, others might find it boring. This isn't a game in which the goal is clear,  and the end result isn't necessarily what you would call gratifying.  There are no bosses to defeat or world to save. To me, this game embodies "virtual reality" in a much more emotional sense.\n\nYou are the subconscious of the protagonist, Julian, as he experiences the agony of waiting on his "dinner date" to arrive. This means, you really have no control over what is happening. You can merely observe and react in the most subtle of ways. As the story unfolds before you, you are given a set of choices. Will Julian glance nervously at the clock, have a cigarette to calm his nerves or have another glass of wine as he bemoans his situation? The voiceover acting is very well done, and adds to realism of the game. If you've ever experienced the anxiety of anticipation. and the agony of disappointment, the game expresses both  perfectly.\n\nIn order to truly enjoy this game, you have to accept the fact that nothing you do will change its outcome. You are merely along for the ride, guiding Julian's thoughts and actions along the way via a growing number of options by pressing specific buttons on your keyboard, which lead to certain interactions. But it's not as if you're sitting there idle while a long cinematic cutscene plays either; it's an experience you can be a part of from start to finish. As Julian's subconscious, you are like the director with Julian as the actor. Considering the options are numerous, and you can choose them in any order you wish, everybody's experience in the game will be slightly different and unique to them, even if the ending is the same. It gives it a very personal feel which I enjoyed. Overall, this is an overlooked and misunderstood little gem of a game.","December 29, 2014","true","0.4"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","17","28","2","0"

You sit at a table waiting for your date to show up, (SPOILERS) she never shows up. The game lures you into thinking it's going to be like surgeon simulator, explaining hand controls using 'q w e r' for the movement of each finger, and 'g' for the thumb. You are then disappointingly backhanded when you instead are greeted with the option to press various keys in order to perform movements/action, all with the aim to waste enough time for more key options to become available, each duller than the last - This functionality saps any potential morsel of comedy, unlike an actual 'key per finger' style, where there are morsels to be found.\n\nFirst, you are limited to tapping your fingers on the table, and looking up at the clock. Then it really gets crazy when the option to eat some bread appears. From thereout you will continue to pointlessly press buttons and observe the mundane animation. My favorite part has to be where you are granted the option to dip your bread into the soup you've been stirring for 10 minutes.\n\nThe game ends when your character staggers out of the apartment after a few glasses of wine, presumably to perform some kind of aggressive crime against the elusive date. This means you basically miss the most exciting part of the protagonists evening.\n\n1/10. There is no challenge, no excitement, and no respite from the ball-achingly dull key tapping. Only play this game if someone has a gun to your head.","December 30, 2014","false","0.4"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

While I do like the idea of being in a subconscious of a person and just see what they are doing but the plot is uninteresting at best, the music gets on your nerve, and they have the nerve of making the main character as one of the most painfully boring person that ever lived. Listening to his thoughts for the first few minutes is slightly bearable but after that I just kept searching for a way to kill him. Worst 20 minutes that I have spent in my life.

Though I beat the game in 20 minutes, I could easily see myself playing this game for more than 300 hours. The game has amazing replay value, and though your decisions do not change the ending, every playthrough will leave you wondering what you could have done differently.\n\nThe game confidently struts into morally gray areas and makes you question your own ethics. The challenge is in deciding whether you should continue, or simply end your miserable evening. Should you have another glass of wine? A seemingly mundane decision, but one that carries world-altering repercussions in this game. Can you resist the temptation of double-dipping your bread, and potentially contaminating your soup? Could you handle the thought of lying to your date about your double dipping habits, should you choose to travel down the path of ultimate sauce corruption? Such maddening thoughts would bring dread to the most stalwart of dinner-havers.\n\nThe horrific potential consequences of your actions are bound to keep you up for many nights. Did you do the right thing? Maybe you gazed at the clock one too many times, causing irreparable damage to your neck. Perhaps you chose to forego cooling your soup slightly and burned the roof of your mouth. Maybe you even did that on purpose; the masochistic behavior of a true non-conforming renegade. Yes, it's true, that you knew the whole time you were shoving piece of bread after piece of bread into your mouth that you were dancing with death. Like a marionette, swaying to the symphony of the all-powerful carbohydrates; their promise of deliciousness cleverly luring your naive and all-too-trusting mind into a false sense of security. Little did you know the grossly unhealthy nutritional value of these baked goods would chaperone you to an early grave.\n\nThere is no end to the madness. I strongly recommend you buy this game and experience its haunting story-telling on your own. If you think you have a good understanding of how your subconscious mind works, and feel that you are in complete control over your actions and its consequences, then prepare to have your illusory world of make-believe completely ♥♥♥♥ing shattered.\n\nIf I had to score this game, it would be ♥♥♥♥ING GAME OF THE ♥♥♥♥ING YEAR. I even came up with a ♥♥♥♥ing subtitle for the game:\n\nDINNER DATE: EAT THE ♥♥♥♥ING BREAD. DRINK THE ♥♥♥♥ING WINE. SMOKE THE ♥♥♥♥ING CIGARETTE. READ THE ♥♥♥♥ING POETRY. STARE AT THE ♥♥♥♥ING CLOCK. MAKE MORE SPACE FOR SUBTEXT BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF CONTENT IN THIS GAME WILL SHATTER THE BONES OF YOUR UNBORN CHILDREN AND THEIR UNBORN CHILDREN; A RESULT OF GENETIC ENGINEERING SINCE YOUR CHILDREN HAD NO BONES WITH WHICH TO BONE AND THEREFORE WERE UNABLE TO REPRODUCE BY STANDARD MEANS.\n\nTHE GAME.","July 18, 2013","true","0.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","1"

It's subtle and effective (If only the controlls were slightly improved).\n\nI won't get in too much on the story, since it's quite short but complex, but it's basically about the experience of being stood up on a dinner date and the effect is has on a persons train of thoughts. The characters reactions are very relatable and it feels very natural and never forced.\n\nHowever, despite the rich content the game is very short, I have yet to decide if the game would be better if it would reach perhaps the 30 minute mark or if it would feel dragged out, but it does leave you with a hunger for more and I expect many more games like this will reach the surface in the near future, because I think the concept alone is nothing but brilliant!","January 2, 2014","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dude constantly moans - about his love life, his career, his friends (I can't believe he has friends), the soup getting cold, that hydrogen atoms only contain one electron, everything - and it gets incredibly monotonous just listening to the guy gripe his ♥♥♥♥ off, while not being able to do anything but glance at the wall clock, eat bread, get progressively more drunk (the guy is staggering after just three glasses of wine - lightweight), light up some smokes by the window (he's not even allowed to smoke in his own home.

You don’t assume the role of Julian Luxemburg, a vaguely British man on a date with a beautiful Japanese woman. You actually assume the role of Julian Luxemburg’s subconscious. And you’re actually being stood up by a beautiful Japanese woman. And you actually never see her, so she’s probably not that beautiful. Whether or not she’s even Japanese, I have my doubts.\n\nAnyway, you “play” the game as Julian’s subconscious. What does that mean exactly? It means you don’t actually get full control of your character. Instead, you’re in charge of “the small unconscious actions we all do”--things like making Julian look at his hand, or look at his other hand, or touch his face. You do not, by the way, get to do any of the cool things a subconscious can do, like give Julian the sudden urge to kill or make him have a nightmare about his naked father. No, but you can make him mindlessly snack on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of bread. And before you start to think that your actions can affect the outcome in the game whatsoever, you’re wrong. Nothing you do matters at all. You could do nothing or everything and nothing would change. To be fair, the game tells you this pretty much right away, so good on them.\n\nSo, you sit there for awhile doing random meaningless ♥♥♥♥ and Julian gets progressively drunker and more depressed as he rambles and whines on and on about his life as a total ♥♥♥♥ing loser and then, after 20 minutes of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, he decides to leave his apartment and the game ends and you feel angry but also a little relieved that it’s over. The end.\n\nGameplay: What the game lacks in fun stuff, it makes up for in not fun stuff, such as stirring soup, looking at a clock, quoting Lord Byron, and constant whining.\n\nRealism: As I said, you get stood up by your date and spend the evening getting drunk alone while succumbing to crippling doubt and insecurity. I don’t know what that’s like because I’m handsome. 0/10.\n\nGraphics: I had the game set on “exorbitant graphical quality” but my character's fingers looked like mangled dongs.\n\nOverall score: 3 out of 10 stars, which makes sense considering I paid 3 out of 10 dollars for the game.","March 13, 2014","true","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The "story" advances relentlessy and unchanged regardless of what you do so to call this a "game" is really not fair.\n\nDon't get me wrong here: I LOVE art games, I love indie short movies, I like everything about this.

You don't control the character in the traditional sense, instead you play a part of his subconcious, you direct where he looks and what draws his attention. You have some minor impulse control in your repetoir as well, but in the end the guy basically just does what he wants anyway... or at least the game forces you to give him what he wants.\n\nYou play a 27 year old guy who has just been stood up by the 20 year old japanese girl that one of his mates has set him up with. She's pretty, and flirty, and from what I understood of the games dialogue she's something of a party girl. As the story progresses you learn a great deal about the young man you're almost controlling, but on the whole thats about all you do.\n\nThere are few choices offered to you by the game. You get to control where the young man looks, which things draw his attention, and which inconsequential actions he peforms; from staring at the clock to eating a piece of bread or smoking. The game progresses down the same path every time. I'm guessing that eventually, if you try to refrain from eating bread or soup, the game will force you to do so as some of the dialogue comments on the things you're eating. I plan to explore this game further.\n\nOn the whole this game really isn't worth it. It's an interesting concept, and the voice acting is interesting... but if you have to miss an out there indie game this year, this is the one to miss.","October 27, 2014","false","0.4"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

They do not give you the ability to give you the control over him at all, instead they let you select what to do with floating bubbles that tell you want to press.\n\nWant to stir your soup around? there's a button for that!\n\nWant to eat some bread? There's a button for that!\n\nWant to look at what time it is?

Part of the problem is that the game doesn't give you a particular reason to care about this guy at all. Basically this guy is a guy who has trouble with the ladies, and thinks he is more philosophical and intelligent than he really is.\n\nAnything that can be considered gameplay is limited to pressing buttons that mostly signify looking at a certain object, and occasionally have something to do with drinking wine, eating bread and soup, and smoking a cigarette. It seems that the game is trying to give you a choice as to what this character does, but there did not seem to be any coorelation with what I was going and what the character was saying, which makes the game feel like one giant pre-scripted monologue, which again is not very interesting.\n\nHowever the biggest sin of the game is that it is too short to justify paying any amount of money for it, let alone at full price for $2.99. Even if they had made the character more interesting and the gameplay interesting, the amount of time to play it would be to short to justify buying it. I completed the game in about 20 minutes. This is not a game that is supposed to be sold on Steam. This is a game that is supposed to be found on a list of games that you can get for free that is praised for being artistic by people who sit in coffee shops sipping esspresso until 3 in the morning complaining how people just don't "get" them, because at the end of the day, this is a game that was made by these people for these people.\n\nFrankly, Dinner Date probably would have faired better if it was a short art film and not a short art game.","March 31, 2014","false","0.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Aside from that however,  I take issue with what is stated in the About section of this game. It claims that controlling the subtle subconscious actions of the protagonist will resonate "with Julian’s thoughts to form an absolutely singular form of intimacy." Resonation is a reflexive action, which does not translate to this game. This game is idle animations and camera controls set to a monologue. If these animations and controls did in fact affect anything, this "game" might have done something to that effect, but no, in reality, there is nothing to relate to in the pretentious character of "Julian," not his affinity for east asians, not his affinity for dinosaur comics or poetry, nothing.","March 8, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This feels more like a school project where only the minimum requirements were met and the assignment was worked on at the very last minute.  I can picture the requirements now:\n1.	Game must contain real-time graphics – check\n2.	Game must contain human interaction – check\n3.	Game must contain at least 15 minutes of gameplay –check\nLeft off the list of requirements were fun, meaningful gameplay, script, and direction. This would have required some additional thought on the creator’s part and it’s just not something that could be bothered with.\nThere’s a warning right off that you are not playing … well, that’s as far as you need to read because there is no gameplay. Hitting keys on the keyboard will cause your character to look at different points of the screen as the events unfold. You’re greeted with a completely unintelligible and unscripted narration which meanders frequently and even manages to be a bit racist.  Apparently, you suffer from both Parkinson’s disease and attention deficit disorder since the camera is constantly faffing about. The entirety of the “game” doesn’t require your input and will automatically unfold even if you decide not to interact with it. Yes, this is a “game” that you don’t even have to play.\nThis is a product which can only be considered art by those who don’t know what art actually is. It’s like having a friend that extols the virtue of paintings of dogs playing poker.  If you’re one of these people that believes this is art or there’s some meaningful message hidden away to be examined with methodical thought then please just refrain from pretending to be a contributing member of society.\nStay as far away from this as you possibly can. Even the time you have taken to read through this regarding this work is time better spent generating dander or turning food into waste. Actually, that action produces something more valuable than this so I would encourage you to perform that.\n","June 21, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Unlike many indie darlings that deliver emotional stories, Dinner Date brings nothing to the table but some bread and wine.\n\nThat does not mean it is not an experience worth having, but do not expect the game to do the legwork for you. I could summarize the story, but it would detract from the experience. The premise however, is simple enough, a man waiting for a woman to arrive for a dinner date. As I am sure other reviews have pointed out, there is not much "game" here it more of an exercise in fiddling around. Your experience may be positive with the game, it may be negative; however, the experience itself is interesting and, like modern art, is really fleshed out in discussions after the fact.\n\nYou will complete the "scene" in approximately 15 minutes. My only real complaint is the price point of this “game”. I feel that $2.99 is excessively high for what it delivered. It was purchased on sale, and it is recommended others do the same. $1 is a safe price point.\n\nOverall, recommended; but more of an academic experiment in exploring how gaming can tackle different methods of storytelling.\n","June 29, 2014","true","0.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You are still guided by the developer's vision. What if I don't want to drink? What if I want to call up my buddies right when I realize she's 20 minutes late and probably not coming?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fierelier/recommended/94000/","fierelier","Fierelier","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fierelier/","58 products in account","What can I say? This is a wonderfully crafted game. Well, it's not much of a game, more like a story. A short one, but it's very sweet.\n\nStory - [10/10]\nYou are in the skin of Julian Luxemburg. You are just the average guy, who is trying to impress a girl via a date. However, your date seems to be late. You sit there, waiting for her. You start drinking the wine and eating the food that you have painstakingly readied for your date. You sit. And wait... It feels realistic and isn't over the top.\n\nGameplay - [6/10]\nThe story plays out in a first person perspective, which really involves you into the character. You do not directly control the movement of the character like in other games; instead you get a slu of buttons that you can press, with icons attached to them, telling you what those buttons do. Unfortunately, it is often hard to make out what the buttons display and you might choose an option that you didn't want. You do nothing else, really. That is the whole thing.\n\nGraphics - [7/10]\nThe colors look very beautiful and the props look good. The texture quality is also very nice. However, the character's hands look pretty low-poly, that could've been prevented. Also, the graphic settings presented are pretty extensive for such a small game! But do the graphics hold up with todays standards? No, but it doesn't look bad by any means.\n\nSound - [9/10]\nThe sounds blend in very well with the visuals (for example, you can constantly hear a clock ticking in the background), as does the music. The music isn't out of place at all. The main character sounds very pleasing, but you might have some trouble understanding him, due to his brittish accent. But there is a subtitle option anyways, so yeah.\n\nConclusion\nThe game is short, and the gameplay is limited. But what did you come to expect from a game where you wait for your date? Sure, the concept of the game is pretty strange, but the way it tells the story is spot-on. It really spoke to me. The gameplay is also spot-on for what it's trying to present, but it's not very challenging or intuitive. If you do not mind spending 3 bucks on a small 20 - 30 minute adventure, then I can only recommend it. Especially when it's on a discount.\n\nI rate this game with a [7/10], but it is only recommended for those who don't mind simple gameplay and a short play-time. I am open to discuss this review, feel free to comment.","September 16, 2015","true","0.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

We all do things unconsciously. But to me I thought it was an interesting message and experience.

When I say that, I mean maybe if you are actually slightly interested in what some random bloke has to say about his relationship status and how much he hates his colleagues then you might enjoy it. Maybe. There is no gameplay; this is not a game in any respect, your sole purpose as the player is to listen to this guy whine for about 20 minutes and then watch the credits. Sure, Dinner Date tries to give the illusion of interaction, it starts off by telling you which keys control which actions but your actions do absolutely nothing to change the story or the game whatsoever.

And for the 20 minutes that it takes to be beaten, 3€ might be too expansive. I got it when it was on sale and I would recommend too wait for the next one.\n\n“Dinner Date” is a very interesting gaming experience, mostly because of the basic idea: You don’t play the character, you play his subconscious. You are not able to change anything, the story will always come to the same end. But in your position in the back of his mind, you are the only one, who can clearly see what is going on. You are the one who witnesses the metamorphosis from a lightly desperate, but kind man to a misogynist, slightly racist ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThe mechanics might be disappointing from a purely mechanical point of view, but they are much more than in most games not only the vehicle to get the story further, but part of the storytelling. The fact, that the game is able to play itself without you as your strange incapacity to change anything, but to play on, is not only a fancy mechanic, it IS the story that you witness.\n\n“Dinner Date” messes a lot of expectations up, that you have in games and gives a whole new view on how game mechanics and narrations really work and what makes them up.\n","January 4, 2015","true","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The main issue, as many have mentioned, is the length.  It is a very short experience indeed, and unlike, say, The Stanley Parable, it has no replay value at all.  The player has no control over the narrative; there are some controls you can use to look around, idly fiddle with stuff and such, but the narrative will soldier on whatever you do, or indeed, even if you do nothing.  That's a shame; a veneer of 'immersion' with no substance.  It's very clear that the game is pretty much made by one person; I'm not sure whether it was a university project, but it does seem like one.  The graphics aren't amazing, even on the highest settings I felt like Julian was made of papier mâché, and the story all takes place in one small room, so most of the work clearly went into the script, and most of the budget to the voice acting.\n\nThe story itself is poignant and relatable, though the main character occasionally jars the relatability with a racist comment or a crude but oddly coy internal discussion about sex.  The voice acting is quite good, but occasionally clashes with the script creating an odd dissonance between the actor and the writer.  If only the actor had felt able to paraphrase and improvise a little, it might have come off more naturally.\n\nPlay it if it's free; buy it if you're interested and it's at least 50% off in a sale.  That isn't rare.  I feel depressed after playing it, but that's because it sometimes reminded me of myself and my own internal monologue, and it does this well.  If only the character were even more relatable, I could recommend this more heartily.","July 27, 2015","false","0.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Although this is not the absolutely first video-game related clear avant-garde movement (even the clarity of it it's arguable, since it is surely not the Harvey and Samyn's manifesto that connects the many non-game, or to be more precise anti-games, that were released in the last four to five years), as we may remember other examples like the demoscene (Scheib et al., 2002), it is surely the first that has bled so fast and directly into the mainstream, with products like Journey (that also tries to put the player in a position of anti-power) or the Telltale Games' adaptation of The Walking Dead (that, together with David Cage's games, makes immediately clear that its protagonist is not an embodiment nor an extension of the player). If this is a true desire for change by an industry tired of the tropes that get reiterated from years and years, or just a temporary fluke, it is not for us to predict. But one thing is sure, and that is that, in its destruction of tropes, Jeroen D. Stout with Dinner Date managed to find a different and intriguing approach to interactive art and story-telling, that is worth to be taken a look at and studied even now, three years after its release.\n\nFull Article: http://www.scriptaludica.com/2014/10/dinner-date-subverting-tropes-of.html","October 14, 2014","true","0.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

It showcases the different mental stages a believable character goes through. You are privy to the neurotic ramblings of a socially-awkward nerdy would-be intellectual who seems to believe the only thing impoartant in life is "getting shagged", and is confused as to why this is difficult for someone who doesn't like to go out.\n\nYou can tell he is in a circle of friends whom all have more fun than him, and works in a place where nobody respects himself, and the only way he can justify his own behavior is through the guise of being a poetry-loving intellectual.\n\nIn many ways it was more educational than fun.

I'm just glad that I bought it in a sale :P still the 20 or so minutes that took me to play it twice where not worth it :( Very disappointing.\nI really was hopping for something meaningful.\nKnowing that the "stages" where pre-scripted, I expected at least to have agency over the line of thoughts of the protagonist. After playing the game a second time I could confirm with 100% certainty that your actions have absolutely no effect over the monologue. Then what is the point anyway?\nAt first glance the visuals of the game look good. There seems to be some kind of art direction. But it falls very short at it's intent of realism. If the maker did not have the skills required to pull off that, a more stylized look would have been better. The plastic hands with a wrong shader make the experience more unsettling.\nI guess that the interesting part of the game is supposed to be its narrative? Well, it sucks too.

I also rarely wish I could refund a game I've bought from Steam, even if I dislike it. This is not one of those times. 2.99 is actually way too much for such a lack of game.\n\nPositive things first:\n- I actually did like the monologue and felt badly for the character, pathetic as he was. However, my dislike for the character rose as I realized that my actions did not have any effect on him.\n- ...it's cheap?\n\nNegative things:\n\n- I don't know about anyone else, but my subconcious desires and fears do have some effect on my life, besides where I look. In fact, that is an incredibly random thing for a "sub-concious" to control. Looking back at the description of the game, I think it should be more evident that the point of the game is not to "play" but to listen. I wouldn't be interested in such a game, but I think they could have avoided a lot of alienation but spelling it out that this was a game like Dear Esther. There is obviously an aundience for this type of game, this really should be described better for this crowd.\n\n- Again, looking back at the description, I see a lot of "unanswered question" type wonderings, but the game is rather straightforword. Julian does not like his coworkers. He does like Byron. There is no real reason to play after the first "act", because it is all spelled out there. I criticized its lousy gameplay strategy before but now I'm criticizing its storytelling.\n\nWhy should I care about Julian? Yes, it sucks that he got stood up, but so what? There is no mystery to him, which is fine in real life, but characters who spend 20 minutes or so talking about themselves should really have something interesting to say. Sure, he likes poetry, but so do a lot of people. And they are probably less insufferable and boring than Julian is. No new information is gathered in each subsequent act and there is no real reason to have the game continue with no new information or insight.\n\nThe game's story got ever-so-slightly more interesting near the end, when someone knocks at the door, and I did feel something at his emotions afterward, but that really doesn't excuse the 20 minutes of boredom proceeding that. Boredom can be used in video games and stories, but it should be rewarded or serve a point.\n\nSo, no, I would not recommend this game to anyone. It is not a game, it is not a compelling story, and it isn't even a good sleep aid, since no one could sleep over Julian's whining.","July 31, 2014","false","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I received it as a gift, and had not heard of it prior. I expected it to be a lame dating simulator, and it's probably the best praise I can give to say that it is not that. Instead, you play as the inner subconscious mind of young-ish man who's set up his small kitchen for a date. As he sits at the table and waits for his date arrive, you can influence his actions by focusing on different parts of the scene, all while listening to the man's thoughts as the night grows later and later.\n\nUnfortunately, this gets monotonous very quickly, and you're stuck following a very linear path as you pick your way through all the interactive parts of the scene. It also becomes very obvious early into the experience what will happen, which doesn't help the game feel more like work than play.\n\nIt's too bad, because the premise is interesting, and it could have been enjoyable, even if only as an art piece. As it stands however, Dinner Date is too slow and predictable to be any fun, in my opinion.","December 2, 2013","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I thought it was special that the developers took a universal human experienceand made it into a 'game' of sorts. I guess it was the intention to add to a feeling of impatience; even if (spoiler alert) we all know that the chick is never going to turn up, it was a pretyt good attempt at showing a spiralling subconscious through a heavy character driven monologue.

I thought it was special that the developers took a universal human experienceand made it into a 'game' of sorts. I guess it was the intention to add to a feeling of impatience; even if (spoiler alert) we all know that the chick is never going to turn up, it was a pretyt good attempt at showing a spiralling subconscious through a heavy character driven monologue. Overall if you'r einterested, try it, it's not much money or time wasted anyway.\n\nPlus you get to pick between three exciting combos of bread: soup, dip...or...no dip at all!

Yes, thats right, You take part of his mind. You don't even have any control over that either! As you watch your guy talk to himself for about 20 minutes, you hear him ramble about useless stuff. Things no one will care about. It is obvious he is being stood up, and now you just see how he feels about it. But hey! At least you get to eat some soup, drink some wine, and think about sex, co-workers, and motorcycles.You can interact somewhat with your surroundings by pressing shown keys.

For me, it wasn't thought-provoking or moving or even interesting, like most of these types of games aim to be in place of traditional gameplay. If you're going to remove gameplay elements like combat, leveling, etc you need to replace with them *something*. A story is usually what developers go with. Here they decided to go in a much more experimental direction and just replace all gameplay elements - including story - with nothing.\nAlso, the game is incredibly short (this might be good, though).

The gameplay is thus: Press F, stare at your right hand; press H, stare at your left hand. The protagonist does a bit of eating and smoking, and waffles a set dialogue...\n\nBased on its description, I understood that I would have no influence over the protagonist's personality, but I did not understand that I would have no influence over the game whatsoever, unable to even trigger events.\n\nAt this point, the Dev might say I'm missing the point, and that his game is a character piece, intended to create "an absolutely singular form of intimacy" between the story-teller and the player. Except there is no intimacy, there is no connection, and there is no uniquely human experience to be had.\n\nThat is Dinner Date's greatest failure, and it is only aggravated by the scripting of its protagonist.\n\nJulian is a 27-year-old British expat, who is living and working in Japan. Half of the game is spent listening to him whine, rather misogynistically, about his struggle to get laid, as he chases 20-year-old Japanese girls, who he openly admits to having nothing in common with. (Desire and loneliness are powerful, compelling themes that I have seen hentai games explore with more poignancy.) The other half of the game is spent listening to him whine about how much he hates his job, his boss, and a random "justifiably bangable" female co-worker. Julian not only believes he is 'too good' for his workplace, he genuinely believes the entire business will fall bankrupt the minute he is head-hunted for a position better-suited to his talents.\n\nIs it really any wonder that his date, Meiko, never shows up? Oops, spoiler.\n\nIf there's anything positive I can say about this game, it's that both the music and voice-acting are pleasant to listen to.\n\nI do not enjoy leaving negative game reviews, especially on ground-breaking indie titles, which deserve all the support they can get, so I wish the Dev all the best for his future titles. However, "Dinner Date" is not worth your time, despite the small price tag attached to it.\n\nEven if, like me, you're a fan of this genre, I recommend you give this one a miss.","December 7, 2015","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is not a game. I'm not one of those people who says that lightly, like everyone who complains about games like Dear Esther. This litterally does not have any of the basic qualities necessary to fill out the "game" part of video game. This... piece of media did something new in one of the most uninteresting ways possible and recieved a laughable amount of praise for it, simply because no one else thought "Hey, my players would love to experience a game where they can't affect so much as even the run time." Or at least no one else thought that and didn't think right after "That's a really bad idea, let's try to make something better even if more conventional."\n\nIt wouldn't be so bad except that in addition to not being a game, it's a pretty awful short film that doesn't seem to want to impart anything upon me except a general dislike of the main(/only) character, and the least an unentertaining art film can do is teach me a new philosophy, make me aware of some plight in the world, or make me feel something emotional besides disdain at the money I spent on it.","February 19","false","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
