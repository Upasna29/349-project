The worst enemies are those damn Swamp Stalkers. They hide in the water and in doing so they are untargetable and likely to ambush you. One map also had 4 Death Wyverns in it and the first game had it was a boss. They really tried to up the difficulty this time around.\n\nDeathkings as well as the original Hexen included an inventory system and character selection. They should have added some new mobs or a new playable character in the expansion as they did with Hexen II but I forgive you guys. :)\n\nDeathkings is a fun game if you don't mind the retro PC graphics and gameplay. It tells you how far we have come in the genre, why some newer titles have failed. Because you don't need high resolution textures for a game it just needs to be fun and Deathkings does that. Incredibly difficult.\n\nI fear the art of Hexen will never again be replicated. The 90s are over.","August 25, 2014","true","13.8"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","1"

Me and my friends played this for hours and hours killing each other, playing COOP ect.  I think the atmosphere survived the ages, but for some reason the gameplay/graphics feel so poor I cannot bring myself to go back and play it again... yet Duke Nukem and DOOM I can easily play again.\n\nThis game was not made for those faint at heart.  It was difficult, dark, and strange.  You can get stuck on some level for hours that would normally only take 10 minutes because they would hide buttons, hidden triggers, or just the requirement of killing a monster hidden behind a glass window you can only shoot from a distance.\n\nThe three chars to choose from are very very different and add a interesting element to the game that old school games really didn't have.  I would only get it for Nastagia, for those that never played it... you will not like this game.","December 20, 2011","true",""," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","1"

This is more of what the first game offered, but I have to say that the level design here is a lot more impressive, with tons of subtle details. The moving floors, the earthquakes, the objects that talk back, the way the ground has a more natural flow, such as the ice in the caves merging with the rock, all are good creative steps forward from the original and seem genuinely inspired.\nMy only complaint is that most of the time, it only uses assets from the original game. Same textures, same enemies, same classes, same items. It's still really fun, but I can't see why the only new things here are the levels. I would have loved to at least fight a new final boss, rather than an endurance run of monsters and all the classes. Oh well.","December 22, 2014","true","7.2"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/2370/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","HeXen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel is an expansion pack for Hexen, released in 1996. It doesn't feature any new gameplay elements, instead it adds more hard levels for single player and adds more levels and improvements for Multiplayer and Deathmatch. But since everybody uses Zandronum for multiplayer in Doom engine games anyway, it's only just more levels.\n\nNow, if you will try to play the game right as it was installed by Steam you will be met by disaster. It really got to be the worst out of all games that id software published here.\nMost importantly, the game is unpatched. It's original release. A flawed original release, where develoeprs somehow forgot to link music of Hexen to new levels. So, unless you download and patch the game up, you will have to enjoy some silence. Amazing. Check community guides on how to do that.\nThen, as usual, DosBox isn't configured good. It lags and so you have to go to game's directory, open the needed .conf file and edit "ddraw" output to "opengl" one.\nAnd then if you want to choose your control and music device, then you will have to go to game's folder again and drag "setup" file over "dosbox" to launch it.\n\nExpansion pack pulls quite an excuse plot twist to justify action: The evil or the sphere teleported you away into land of the dead where you have to defeat Deathkings before being able to return. Who are they anwyay. Ah, right, they just reuse end bosses from Hexen.\n\nSo, game adds three new hubs to conquer.  Which totals in around 30 levels. They don't use any new textures. Though there are some interesting inviroments anyway. But it's more of Hexen but harder.\n\nThe thing is, Hexen was already too dragged. It didn't had enough of variety in combat and weapons for each class. It had tedious part. And bringing even more levels that are also harder and bring no new gameplay elements, well, it's not a good idea. At all.\nYes, it has a sin of using bosses of Hexen as tough enemy. You fight big mage demon at the first level of the second hub already.\n\nIt doesn't help that I had glitch two different glitches on the first hub. First, there weren't enough of fire masks, key items, in the first world. Yes, I checked with walkthrough on all spots. Somehow, there wasn't. Somehow. And then on another level magic bridge just didn't appear either. And wyverns, bosses of Hexen, got stuck in walls too. So, watch out on first hub.\n\nAnd main problem and difference in difficulty is monster respawn.\nOriginal Hexen would spawn Ettins, common melee weak enemies, after each 10 minutes. Or at least it feels so. It was there just so player will not get lonely while being lost.\nDark Citadel rushes you down and beats you up. It can spawn hordes of any kind of enemy more often. And shielding centaurs that are incredibly annoying or flying imps that shoot fireballs at you aren't good enemies to respawn.\nWhat it means is that you will have to rush levels down, having to solve "puzzles", saving/loading and doing other things while being rushed down and under constant heavy pressure. Killing enemies in this game doesn't bring any benefit, there is no leveling or such. You only waste mana and time. A lot of them. So you will have to try not to pay attention to them as you have to rush rush rush your way. And if you get lost, like everybody does in Hexen, then it will not be pretty.\nIt gets really bad on the main level of the last hub, Citadel itself. It's pretty much a hall with teleporters and switches. With water pools for no reason. And enemies not only respawn all time there, they also teleport around when reaching water pools for some reason, with without any special effect. You will be telefragged at least once.\n\nActually, perhaps it's easier to play as Mage here. His basic weapon, that don't require mana, is a ranged one.\n\nSo, Deathkings isn't good expansion pack It feels like it just milks on Hexen more. It's hard not in a good way, it's buggy, it brings nothing new outside of levels and it just makes Hexen outstay it's welcome. You miss nothing.","June 18, 2015","false","6.2"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

It's an immidiate sequel of the original first chapter. Actually there's not much to say, this expansion shares all the goods and the bads of the original title, besides the fact that all the levels results Tougher than the original game. You don't have any new monster and there's not really a Final boss as scary as the Second Serpent Rider Korax, yet ther's a nice final surprise.\nSharing the same aspects of the original title means we will be able again to choose our class before beginning our game. Warrior, Cleric And Mage are still the three classes we might choose, affecting our gameplay in the same way as the classic Hexen. You still have the inventory system with the pleasant improvement where you keep all your items quantity in your inventory instead of just loosing all backups but one per each item once you proceed to the next hub.\nAs usual this game is released with DosBox to launch with. Fortunately they didn't even try to clumsily implement any mouse configuration as done in the horrible DooM releases.\nSince this is an expansion with no significative innovations I'll keep the same PROs And CONs.\n\n+++PROs+++ STRUCTURE. Clearly the all new structure of the levels is an innovation that, paired with puzzles in the minor levels, gives the game a big playability by making the player moving back and forth from more maps. This way, even though you will end up re-visiting the same place many times you have the illusion of a bigger world. Honestly this always had the look of a maze to me, but I've never really tried that much. In this expansion even though there's less Hubs and levels it is structured to be more complicated and difficult, representing a bigger challenge for the Classic title fans.\nFANTASY. Following the fantasy atmosphere from its predecessor Hexen does a bigger job by renewing the locations and making the game with a bit darker tones. in my opinions it's a bit scarier and ominous than Heretic.\nGAMEPLAY. Besides the ability to look up and down already introduced in Heretic, Now you can jump as well. Nothing too useful but at least that's a step forward XD. And just like Heretic you still have the inventory system with some old items already seen in Heretic and other useful and interesting tools. Note that some of these tools have a different functions according to the class you choose.\nMODS & COMMUNITY. You can find mods, and other stuff. But most importantly, there are custom ports with graphical and gameplay improvement or guides, both in steam and in other sites, with tricks and advices on replacing DosBox with better ports and implementing the Steam Overlay.---CONs--- MUSIC. Unfortunately i didn't enjoy that much almost any of the tracks in the game, unlike its predecessor Heretic.\nSTEAM OVERLAY. As usual, like on every other old steam release running on DosBox, there's no Steam Overlay.\nSTRUCTURE.  Even though this is a new kind of structure I personally didn't enjoy it too much because it forces me to visit and revisit the same leves again and again before proceeding to the next hub, resulting in a repetitive gameplay.","February 12","true","0.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It offers nothing new over Hexen.  No new weapons or enemies, just 3 new map hubs.  I can't even recommend it even if you liked the original Hexen.  It's not just 'More of the same' but the difficulty is lazily increased by enemies continuously spawning into the map - constantly interrupting your ability to focus and find the required switch or key.  Enemies jump and spawn from anywhere endlessly, but ammo is still limited.  Environmental traps are impossible to intuit so you will regularly killed out of the blue when fighting endless waves of monsters.  I had to quit by the end of the first hub, it was clear that the completion of the game depended on attrition tactics - constantly die until the combination of luck and switch memorization gets you through.\n\nYou probably already have this game if you have Hexen, as I believe it's just the one bundle, but if you dont, then don't buy it.  Its the same game as hexen but designed to punish with almost no enjoyment.\n\nhttp://theboilingpot.net/?p=260","February 17, 2015","false","2.9"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","5"

Bar none, my favorite FPS. How its expansion pack fails to live up to the original. Long story short, the balancing issues are obnoxious and it really takes away from the enjoyment of the game; for the sake of cranking up the difficulty, now ALL monsters respawn instead of just Ettins, which as pointed out by another user, renders much of the game an unbalanced pain in the @$$ instead of making it more challenging due to constantly draining you of ammo and supplies. Imagine having to play Doom with constantly respawning Cacodemons and Mancubi, that's how it feels to have respawning Chaos Serpents when your Fighter is low on green mana (trying to do Brackenwood as the Fighter, without even your Hammer of Retribution yet while FOUR Death Wyverns are flying around, is tantamount to only having your fists and chainsaw while being hounded by 4 Cyberdemons). By comparison, the expansion to Heretic (Shadow of the Serpent Riders) manages to up the difficulty while not making it seem far too cheap. And speaking of Shadow of the Serpent Riders, it comes packaged with the vanilla Heretic when you buy it, why couldn't they simply add Deathkings to the original Hexen port? Then it would make sense to buy them both as one package deal. So that being said, only pay money for this if you're buying it as part of a Heretic/Hexen bundle, if not, save your money for Hexen 2 instead. At least it provdes some novelty instead of an underwhelming rehash of a classic.","June 12, 2015","false","15.2"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"
