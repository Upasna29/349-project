It's like this only nicer Graphics and a bit more complex.

But it's a crapshoot. It is pretty detailed in that you make camp, then proceed to fortify and defend while maintaining survival skills and needs such as food shelter and defense. However every mission you go on has a pass/fail percentage. While these pass/fail percentages are fine, what you find and what your reward is is not. I had a hard time picking up the resources I needed to make my camp self sustained. It was a 60/40 grindfest/fun.  The potential for this game is through the roof, I hope they work out the kinks to make this the game it could be.\n\nPositives:\nPretty detailed and varied abilities, such as farm, kennel, walls, sandbag crafting etc.\nBase building is fun, altho a grindfest for materials\nRandomness to it, with bad weather, zombie raids, and more\n\nNegatives:\nThe locations you discover need to have details about whats there, ie wood, metal, etc. I mean you scouted it, you should know\nGrinding feels a bit tense at times\n\nThe potential is here, lets hope they realize it.\n\n6/10 so far.","January 12","true","3.0"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","29","35","0","0"

Still in early access and with beta testing, but at this point i must say,  its already a good start for a game.\n\nPros:\nMixed gametype - you don't need to spend hours only in fighting against zombies, you can manage your camp and give orders, build, expand.\nStats - a kind of monitoring of camp status, what resources are gained, what morale status of the camp and etc. This way you don't just need to loot, else you will also find yourself looking for improoving the status of your camp by building or searching for improvment.\nNice Graphics - at this point its still early to say something about all the textures, but in overall very nice to play and search the city.\nTime change - The change is great idea, at night you just start looking at every corner and trying to find a zombie there.\nSounds and atmosthere - in boundle with time change, the sound of broken glass or zombie near you remind you the atmosphere lost in other games with zombies.\nGame staff - 2 patches in 2 days that include major fixes for game, game team responding fast to found issues and trying to fix it as soon as possible. Very nice to see that they are working hard and listening to the gamers.\n\n\nCons:\nStill early access - many work to be done\nMissing multiplayer - again its early access....\nMemory consumption - u suppose its the next patch or optimization\nBugs and issues - but still its early access.\n\n\nIn Summary:\nWith the low cost of this game and hard working people, this is a way to success.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BracerRocks/recommended/427950/","BracerRocks","TFG.PudgeWiggle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BracerRocks/","309 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFor an Early Access game I'd say CM Softworks nailed it! This game has features that most games don't implement until the Beta stage. They may be small features, but they're still there! This game has provided me with 10 hours of suspense, and zombie slaying fun! If you like games where you get to kill zombies, earn/spend skill points (on three attributes at the moment) and manage your own survival shelter then this game is perfect for you. Not many zombie games give you the ability to loot cities in real time, and manage a camp where you can build Farms to have a food supply, and a Radio Tower so you can communicate with other known camps! There are many more things to create that help your camp grow and survive. You can even simulate the ability to search for other areas to loot, and you can choose to loot them in real time or simulate the loot phase.  This game has you make some serious decisions too. An example: "There is a horde of zombies spotted near your camp. This will conclude in Two Phases". So you have to think; Is the camp ready? Is your defense rating where it needs to be? Should you run out into the city to grab supplies before they get to the camp? If there is no one at your camp to fight off the horde of zombies then they overrun it and you lose it so you have to get everything done in the alotted time given. There are different types of zombies as well. They're not just your standard infected walking around. Currently there is "The Crawler" (The nickname I gave her; She can be spotted with her blonde hair) and "The Boss" (He's easily recognizable. These zombies have the chance to drop rare loot, but take excessive amounts of damage so I recommend a weapon with a good amount of ammo. Randomly throughout the game you will see a bright shinging light (Red or Green so far) and that spawns a loot crate. Green Flare=Resources Red Flare= Weapons. Where will you put all this loot? There is a Storage system at your camp that can be upgraded to hold more things! You just need the right materials.  There is a small part to the camp management that I haven't used personally yet but it's there. The ability to craft "Homemade" weapons and ammo using materials that are looted.   Here's my Pros and Cons list so far:\n\nPros\n-Zombies\n-Looting System\n-Different Type of Zombies\n-Camp Management\n-EXP System\n-Unique Zombie/Player Animations\n-Weapon Rarity System\n-Durability Ratings for Weapons/Clothing (Although Clothing doesn't decay yet)\n-Ability to Rescue/Recruit Survivors\n-Working Random Loot System (No location is the same)\n-Small Material Crafting System\n-You can Slide\n\nCons\n-Hit Boxes for Zombies are not the Greatest (You might take a hit when you shouldn't have)\n-Camera Movement is a bit Funky/Takes awhile to get used to\n-Finding Survivors is sometimes a pain\n*****The time it takes to get from "Morning" to "Night" is Really Short***** (Fixed in Last Patch)\n-There's not an Easier way to Find Survivors\n-Ability to Control Where your Attack Goes (It just follows in one direction until the animation is done)\n\nSo all in all there is some Pros and Cons. The Cons can/will be fixed. The company is pushing out updates every few days. They listen to the consumer, and act on what everyone would like to see. You can currently vote on different additions that you would like to see in the game and that is checked daily by the developers. I recommend this game at it's current (on sale and base price) and with where it's headed this game will be an amazing addition to the zombie era of gaming.","December 30, 2015","true","26.0"," 20 of 25 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","20","25","0","8"

The game combines both strategy and skill by having both a "Camp Management" mode and a 3rd person mode.\n\nQualityGraphics - The graphics in The Withering are of mid-quality, you can see when traveling in-game that it could be polished a bit more. Also the menu buttons could be done better to match the beautiful background, we're not playing in 2006 people!\n\nSound - The soundtrack the developers chose for this game was a great match for the game, it helps the use the scare and creepiness in the game. They have included a few soundtracks just so that people would not get too bored.\n\nGameplay - The gameplay in The Withering is pretty confusing at first, but after playing around with it a bit it you get used to it. Also when playing in 3p mode the controls used to attack and to jump are a bit weird for those coming from popular FPS games such as myself.\n\n\nPros & ConsPros:\n- Interesting and Unique Concept\n- Nicely made menu background\n- Scary Music\n- Different Looking And Types of Zombies\n\nCons:\n- Menu Buttons a bit out of date\n- Graphics Unpolished\n- No Cards (Not needed)\n- Tutorial is not in depth and doesn't really explain how to do things but rather what to do.\n\nConclusionTo finish off this review, The Withering is an awesome apocalyptic game with a lot of potential, especially for such a cheap price, but still has a lot to work on. I'd recommend this game to people who like both action and strategy. Can't wait for the game to be fully released!\n7/10^^My rating (will change if they make a difference in future updates.)\n\nFor more recommendations by LL's Game Giveaways and Reviews on quality indie games or ones with high potential follow our group curations here!","January 27","true","1.2"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","73","24","33","7","0"

Early access or not this game has a lot in it to keep you entertained for hours at a time.  When I first started it took me a bit to find a decent weapon in the town so those karate kicks, however expertly delivered, took a while to take those buggers down.  I eventually found a crowbar which made scavenging the town a much more enjoyable experience.  From there I built my inventory of weapons/ammo and other goodies and really found it interesting to explore the town.  What I enjoy in these types of games is some suspense and this game definitely delivers that.  There were a number of times when the sun started to go down and the light got a little dimmer and I would be focusing on one thing or another and then have some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sneak up on me.  Made me jump a little especially with the creepy/suspenseful music playing.  Music for me is a big part of any good game and I liked what I heard so far.\n\nI really like the combination and balance between the live action scavenging and camp management.  It was fun to go out and scavenge for things you needed for that next building, camp upgrade, or new weapon I wanted to make.  It would be nice to be able to see specifically what materials you are picking up so you could decide what to keep or drop since you can only carry so much.  You can for guns, ammo, meds, etc. but not for some reason not materials.  I tried dropping some stuff in specific locations to come pick them up the next time but no luck.  It would also be nice to be able to hide items in a trunk or locker so you could get them the next time you’re in town.\n\nThere is a lot to enjoy in this one so I don’t want to give too much away.  Overall I have had a lot of fun so far and am really looking forward to seeing what comes next.  As a side note, I have been impressed with the level of involvement the developers have had in the community and the rate at which updates/fixes have been coming out.

Its designation as Early Access is misleading, the current version feels more like a highly polished game and is already in class of its own.  It is teeming with things to collect, places to explore and endless hours of entertainment.  I've spent over a 100 hours already and I still feel like I've only scratched the surface.  I can't wait to see what they do next - you won't regret this purchase.\n\nPros:\nPerfect combination of fps and base management.\nHuge number of weapons, craftable items and upgrades.\nHighly active and dedicated developers.\nYou'd expect to pay $60 for content like this, the price is a steal.\n\nCons:\nNavigation difficult at first.\nFinding items at first is frustrating.  Once you figure out where to look and where not to look, the game becomes much more manageable.\nCombat system confusing at first if you don't read the guides.\n\n\nThe zombies aren't so OP or numerous that you're constantly hanging on for dear life.  However, poor planning, decision making or aim and they'll tear you apart.  Different areas provide different risks and rewards that you choose based on your current need, available resources and ability to survive.  It really feels like you stepped into the walking dead - something most games promise but rarely deliver.  Scavenging the materials you need to survive, keep healthy, protect and expand your camp is a constant battle.  It's the perfect blend of these two elements that make this game a true gem.\n\nHints:\n1.) Read the guides before you play for combat tips and the basic map of the area - knowing how to properly melee and where you are on the map makes a huge difference.\n2.) Nightime is not pitch black if you wait for the moon to rise.  Find a safe place to wait it out, then continue scavenging until your backpack is completely filled with the items you need.  Leaving when it gets dark out means your camp has to survive on less than it has to.","March 18","true","141.7"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","24","39","0","8"

You are gathering materials improving your base camp and you can go to 3rd person view scavenging 3 towns. The zombies are pretty easy to kill with for ex an iron bar except for two bosses. You collect weapons, ammo, materials. After a few hours it gets a little bit boring. They should add more zombies, more weapons, attack moves, more cities to scavenge. In the 3rd town there are also bandits with automatic weapons and they are moving in a group so you can kill them from distance if you fave a sniper rifle. They drop a lot of stuff after dying. Aah, zombies are a little bit stupid, you run away from them, the follow you, you jump on a car and they stop. You can then just aim with your gun and score a nice headshot - it is a good tactic to spare ammo but I do not know why you cant jump on some cars. Antibiotics are best to heal. If you are wounded use them or go back to base and wait a few days to recover. After you die you are still alive in your base but you have to wait a few days to be able to scavenge again. I liked the graphics, the sounds and the idea. Night is fun and it is a little scary to scavenge with the torch and all the noises out there. I struggled at the beginning with inventory capacity but after I found a backpack it was ok. In the camp you have also to improve storage to have more inventory slots. I did it at the begining. You can also launch scavenges parties form your camp. Your camp can also be attacked by zombies at some time and you have some tactic screen where you choose defensive strategies. At the beginning it was easy but after like 30 days I got overrun and everybody got killed - I had like 5 survivors including myself. It was strange because it was like 6 zombies and we had automatic weapons :) When everybody died the game did not end and I was able to scavenge towns with my survivor being officialy dead :) I love zombie games and this game has the potential to be a really good game. It needs still a lot of work from developers side. Keep it up!\n\nThe good:\n- graphics & sounds\n- weapons\n- day and night\n\nThe bad:\n- some functionalities do not work in base camp\n- more cities to scavenge needed\n- population is difficult to increase","April 14","true","19.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

I am going to not recommend the game for while it has potential at this point it has some sensational flaws and lack of polish, it's got fairly large areas to explore which contain large amounts of nothing and respwaning zombies, I'd really appreciate it if someone could make a good zombie game which doesn't have respawns especially ones which come out of the air right in front of you.  I was giving it a chance despite such environmentally limiting ideas as not being able to open doors, climb anything more than 1 foot high run for more than 20 metres before becoming exhausted (seriously, cardio) then while exploring the first area I ran into super zombie who ate 13 bullets from my pistol 10 from my rifle 50 hits from my pipe and didn't go down he can also run faster than I can and for longer you can guess the results of that escapade. Hint I'm trying to say this kind of enemy shouldn't be in an area you've marked as 'easy' and should have some kind of weakness like being slow, or not invincible.\n\nThe scavenging environment is not very immersive because it has random crashing, tinkling, pipe dropping sounds around you which don't match anything actually going on which is rather silly. It feels a little like Stalker sometimes in that the graphics are (relatively) ♥♥♥♥ and there are odd amounts of things lying around in unusual places for you to scavenge.\n\nThis game could benefit greatly from such novel concepts as difficulty settings ranging from I'd like to have fun testing your alpha to I really did unironically enjoy the Dark Souls series. Some more character customisation, female characters which are coming apparently, an extra person in your camp when you start, some interesting character building like perks or skills or backgrounds much like you would find in This War of Mine which someone who wrote a terrible review compared this to.\n\nOverall I don't feel like I should have paid for this and feel like I should have tested it for free and then given the recommendation that is has potential but isn't really there yet.","April 5","false","6.8"," 18 of 32 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","18","32","5","0"

The Dev ( as usual ) has answered countless times on that. The answer being, MP / and or Co op in the plans. Info available on details in the Forum.\nMore character customization.  Currently you do have both Male and Female models. But at the start of the game you can only change the character menu portrait and the starting clothing look.\nand of course.. all the usual things that go with an EA.\n\nI did not follow this from the start. I only looked it over today and did some research. The post and reports show it has changed much since it first arrived. That is always a plus. It also shows relevant answers from the Dev team often in the forum.\nGame play wise, it is not a fast pace start off in the thick of it type Zombie game. Its a strange twist on several approaches to Zed gaming fans. First it is based on camp / survivor management. The system is simple to figure out and work with. Includes a quick in your face tutorial on getting started in the camp section. The UI is not the prettiest, but it serves well for now.\nThen the ' sort'a ' open world. This is a ' sort'a ' moment because you dont just walk around an open world.  You start the game with knowledge of your general surroundings, but it is pretty limited. You learn more by assigning scouts to go and snoop. Once that is done you find either new fixed locations or event type. Fixed are sections of an area, say like a part of a residential zone. Events are like finding an abandoned camp, or a derelict vehicle, junk site etc. You then assign a team member to head out. Now comes the ' sort'a '. This takes place on an over the shoulder character. You have to have boots on the ground to explore, find items, equipment etc.\n\nCombat is simple and varied. Different stats of the team member allow different affects. For example my high strength member can do a special move via double click RM and kill pretty much each time. My less buff can do the move.. but she has yet to kill on a first time strike. She is however much better with her firearm. See how that works?\n\nKeys are mapped in the oddest fashion I ve ever seen. You just have to look to probably agree. But you can re-map with no problems. Movement is the normal.. other keys are weird. MAKE SURE you look and / or re-map.\n\nCLIMBING on cars... this is important. Lesson learned. The first ' easy ' or ' baby ' zone it is not like it is other places. No idea why. After you leave the first area when you approach a vehicle at a climb / jump point you get a prompt.  In the first area you just cant get on them at all. You can however climb on a van.. its weird to read.. but if you experience you will get it.  No problems after the first area as I said tho'.\n\nFinding loot... its hard. Its supposed to be. Unlike many games that just hand you finds.. other than obvious boxes laying around or tool chest, you have to look. You will find things like food, medicine, water, gear, weapons, and of course ammo. But its not marked with shiny lights or arrows to glowing boxes of goodies.  But it does give you a nice prompt when you do find it.. so you can ' sort'a ' just mouse around and make some finds that might not be obvious. But you have to be close to them.  BUILDING materials etc are usually easy finds. They are in boxes or took boxes. Easy being relative to the amounts tho'. Areas with an abundance are not easy to walk into and out of. Easy to pick areas are pretty empty.\n\nNice thing. When your out exploring you can leave the area via ESC and return to camp.. which causes a 10 second countdown, during which you are vulnerable.. so make sure your safe. Or you can walk out without the delay.\n\nOverall, with its current EA price of $9.99 US its not a bad little thing.  But at its current state its not going to be for everyone. I see myself enjoying it, but not in large doses. More of a slow and steady time. BUT ON THAT. Not all the enemies are push over brain dead Zeds... that you will see on your own..","June 4","true","2.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

UI is awful. It requires dozens of clicks to do anything and gives little to no useful information. Camp is easily maxed out. You can craft some things at the camp but you won't. It's a pain in the ♥♥♥ to manage dozens and dozens of materials required to craft some simple thing. And UI tries his best to make it tedious.\nTPS is boring and not rewarding. You have to walk slowly around large empty city. Every 30 minutes it gets dark and you can't see a thing. Flashlight doesn't help much. The game is very dark and a strain to the eyes. There is no item higlights so you have to scan rubble for some water bottle.\nZombies, soldiers and loot respawns frequently. So you don't have to explore the area actually. Just run (i mean walk slowly) back and forth between couple of loot spots.\nInventory is very limited even with large backpack. Here it is represented by most stupid slot system. Where AK takes same amount of space as a chocolate bar. There are tons of different meds, food, ammo. In the end you'll just end up picking only those of em who stacks better.\nNo real difference between guns. Any gun is OK to kill NPCs. Automatic weapons are useless due to rarity of ammo.\nCharacter progression is linear and doesn't give much bonuses.\n\nOverall this game is raw, crude and unpolished.
