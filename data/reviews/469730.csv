There are few unlockable characters. Level desings are iteresting and weird at the same time. There are a few fps drops but they only occur after you lose so it's not a big problem and I hope it will be fixed soon.  And I forgot to mention there are Boss fights!\nOverall I'd give this game 8/10. Maybe some futures updates to add something new.","May 17","true","4.9"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","15","17","0","0"

There‚Äôs nothing different about it, it‚Äôs pretty fun with some some catchy music and some nice themes going on. This review won‚Äôt be long since there isn‚Äôt much to talk about with this type of game, you can just see the video below which is self-explanatory how this game is. It‚Äôs a very simple game but its too addictive at the same time.\n\nGameplay is straight forward, you‚Äôre constantly moving and holding the mouse button will make you fly up and if you let go of the button you descend down and if you end up at the bottom of the screen, you die. There‚Äôs stuff flying everywhere including birds, bees, ice cubes(what?), snow balls, comets, rocks etc. There‚Äôs boss fights too where a boos would appear and throw things at you and you have to dodge them. There are coins too which you can collect as well as some power pickups like a magnet which will collect coins even if you don‚Äôt go through them. The other power-up is a shield which makes you invulnerable for a short time and anything you touch will die.\n\nEvery time you start a game there‚Äôs a different theme every time. Some these include Egyptian theme, Space theme, Winter snowing theme etc. Other than that you can unlock new characters such as Santa pug, Sombrero wearing pug, a panda, a dragon, a hamster etc.\n\nThe sound in this game is so cute and especially the different themes‚Äô music sound really relevant to their themes.\n\nConclusion: Cute game, cute music, addictive gameplay and only 99 cents (as of this review it‚Äôs 40% off and 59 cents), it‚Äôs a bargain. Even if you play 2 hours, it‚Äôs worth it.\n\nGameplay video below:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=682548308","May 11","true","4.0"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","1"

Buy it.\n\nNow the serious  and less funny  review.\n\nSuper Mega Neo Pug is the game about the pugs from the first game, Turbo Pug, flying and avoiding various obstacles and bosses, getting coins and collectibles. Not gonna ask how are the pugs flying. Still good.\nThe game is great, and it gives you a lot more freedom and content than the first game.\nI can't say that there's not enough content, since the game was released 9 days ago, so I don't expect a game full of content, but I still hope the game gets updated.\nIn my opinion, this game is harder than the first one, sure, it gives you more space to move, but there's more obstacles and patters almost impossible to do.\nGetting the pugs and items it's pretty fun, though.\nSo.\n\nPros\nThere's pugs. Lots of pugs to get. Needs more. More pugs.\nNice power-ups to pick and make the game a bit less impossible.\n4 nice different biomes: Snowy, Grassy, Sandy and Space biomes.\nGood soundtrack, my favorite song is Space Sprint.\n\nCons\nNot much content???????\nHard as ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•.\nBoth soundtrack and gameplay get really repetitive after a while.\nIt doesn't tell you how many coins you need to get a character, so you have to pick up some coins and then be sad because you didn't get the pug with the mexican hat.  by the way i love the mexican hat pug thank you guys so much i love you\n9/10.\nNeeds more pugs.","May 20","true","1.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Desert is a bit bright and does not help with the visiblity of the flames, music is cool and unfortunately sometimes ends too early for me to enjoy some funky bass in space. The lifetime of this game is not that long since all one can do to progress is to either beat the leaderboard, unlock some customes and beat some bosses (more outlast a boss).

The controls are wasd to move, ctrl, shift, and alt to shoot, and a bunch of other things. Too bad none of those do anything, though, because mouse1 is the only control, in a Flappy Bird style of gameplay. The launcher also will randomly not remember things or change them for no reason, requiring me to restart the game 3 times before the game launches in the correct monitor, then another restart to get the proper resolution.\n\nWhile the resolution was a square, the black edges of the screen didn't clear the Steam overlay, so whenever I receieved a Steam message or opened Steam in-game, that would stay there forever.\n\nThe game also has impassable obstacles that fill the entire screen, and it's not too uncommon. In my 20 minutes of gameplay I had that happen at least twice.\n\nThe gameplay itself gets boring almost instantly, with the only goal to Flappy Bird your way past usually dodgable objects and get the highest score. This is the same gameplay in hundreds of free flash games, except this time it costs money, and has less content than many of those free games.\n\nIt has some okay music, but every time you die the menu music will instantly start playing so you hear the first second of it over and over, and it's so aggrivating. This would be a fine free flash game, but as a payed game I can't recommend this.\n\nUpdate: In response to the developer not understanding what I meant by "free flash game", take a look at this game\nhttp://www.kongregate.com/games/SilenGames/cyber-chaser\n\nIt's free, it's a Flash game, and it has more things in it than this game. It has a shop, unlocks, different levels, bosses, enemies, but still uses a very similar "click to ascend" gameplay of this game.\n\nThat game is free, and has more content than this game (but I don't really think either are fun). So, yes, developer, this game shouldn't cost money. You can charge money, but it isn't worth it. I apologize if I come off as harsh or mean, but it's my honest opinion, and I hope you can take this new criticism as well as the rest of it.","May 14","false","3.5"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","9","18","0","1"

Just go onto sites like newgrounds or fastgames and play some free flash games. You'll have a much better time and it's free. I know the devs aren't asking for a fortune for this game but still. Not worth it in my honest opinion","May 14","false","0.3"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","1"

Much to the game's detriment obstacles often from offscreen without much warning leading to unsurvivable situations.","May 16","false","1.8"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","2","0","0"
