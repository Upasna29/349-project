Of course when it comes to rhythm games, timing is critical. Unfortunately, this game has no sync settings, which means that you may need to calibrate and adjust your graphics and audio settings in some other manner. Often times, I have to hit buttons earlier than hearing from the song in order to score a perfect hit.\n\nUntil the game gets more popular on Steam, online multiplayer is still very scarce. Considering its popularity on previous platforms (and more importantly, its age), it's still yet to be determined on whether or not anybody is willing to play online.\n\nIf you're a veteran rhythm gamer, you won't have a hard time learning and adapting to the controls and gameplay rules at all. Considering your experiences, you might find the AI in tournament and skirmish battles to be a little too merciful.\n\nDance Magic is a nice, light, casual game for the rhythm game fanatic that carries the essences of previously well-known titles and creates a slightly distinguishable twist on how it can be played, either alone or against others. But its best you only get it if you find friends who have a common interest.","February 16","true","31.4"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","25","37","0","3"

Will it be you or your opponent! It comes down to who can get the best move to stun the other. Are you the greatest dancer? Well, it’s time to demonstrate your talent and while you’re at it save the world!\n\nDance Magic is an action / dance game where you play one of seven dancers available to you (actually three at the start and four to unlock). Each dancer has his/her own style of dancing, depending on whether you like a bit of a Spanish move, break dancing, groovy disco dancing and or something else. Essentially, what you will need to do is to beat your opponent by synchronising your moves with the rhythm of a song (over 30 tracks in this game). It is all about timing and it can be tricky at times. Have you ever heard the phrase he/she has two left feet? If so, you might be one of them! The game will give you several modes to play; tournament, battle (skirmish, multiplayer) and freestyle. In the tournament, when you beat an opponent, you will be rewarded with money.\n\nWith this money, you will be able to unlock a stacks of items for each of the dancers. If you like customization, you will be well served here. . . Fabulous! You will be able to change clothes, hair-dos, jewellery and more. If you like customising characters, you will love this feature, its great fun!\n\nVery nice graphics and the game runs very well.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/recommended/394260/","TheGameTutor","TheGameTutor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheGameTutor/","3111 products in account","Released on last gen consoles over 3 years ago Dance Magic finally arrives on PC and having received fairly negative reviews at the time I am looking at the game with an open mind.\n\nFirst thing to mention is the rhythm action game most closely resembles the rather brilliant PS1 classic Bust a Groove but sadly the spirit of that game only part lives on with Dance Magic.\n\nThere are 2 main but very different parts to the game. The battle sections see you input commands in time with the beat of whatever song you are dancing against. Different combo commands not radically dissimilar to Mortal Kombat perform different functions such as create and break shields, attack you opponent and perform a variety of special moves that attack and give buffs.\n\nAs the game progresses health bars wear down much like a fighting game with one character eventually either falling or the time running out and it going to whomever had more life.\n\nThe other game type is freestyle which plays exactly like a normal rhythm action game but with a moving line (like Parappa) rather than moving icons. The main issue with this is that is very jarring to flick to a new set of icons and a style more akin to DDR would have played better. Also annoyingly there is a lot going on in the background and often following the blue line is more difficult than it really should be.\n\nBoth modes are enjoyable in their own way but equally both become quite samey relatively quickly with most of the special moves not really appearing (at least on the face of it) to affect the fight in any meaningful way. I did however definitely prefer the battle mode to freestyle as at higher levels it definitely had a sense of urgency but sometimes looking at the icons, keeping track of the beat and following the combos in the bottom left got a little overwhelming.\n\nYou can use a controller, keyboard or hell prob a dance mat if you can get one working. I used a controller and found it reasonably responsive but it was definitely easier to use the action buttons rather than the d-pad or analogue stick.\n\nObviously the music is a big part of a game like this and while there were a few good tunes the game lacked any stand out songs that stuck in my head. Almost 18 years after playing Bust a Groove I can still remember the individual tracks. I think the decision to pick general songs rather than link songs to characters was perhaps not the best move. You can however use your own music tracks and this works reasonably well and if an excellent feature that definitely gives the game more appeal to music game fans.\n\nVisually the game is nice to look. Nothing incredible but equally pleasing to the eye. As you play the game you unlock money to buy customisations to your characters. This happens fairly quickly and a single play through of the single player mode is all that is needed to unlock a set you like the look of for each character. It actually took me a little while to work out how to unlock new songs and characters in the store but maybe that’s just me. I definitely felt however more costumes to unlock would have been good and I personally think unlocking songs should be different. Possibly unlock them by playing each one in single player mode.\n\nFinally the multiplayer mode… or should I say lack of. I was unable to play a single random on-line game always being met by no servers if I searched or simply sitting waiting for someone to join for 30 mins if I created my own. Now obviously this is most likely because people are simply not playing the game but it does make this a hard sell if multiplayer and leader boards are your thing. I did however eventually get a game going playing with friend of the site Joe and found the multiplayer experience to be largely identical to the single player experience in both modes.\n\nOverall I had some fun with Dance Magic and for a relatively cheap price of £6.99 or your regional equivalent you might find some enjoyment here. Time will tell if any real multiplayer community develops but for now I would buy this on the basis of the single player. A fun little snippet of rhythm action that isn't going to set the world on fire and to be honest unless you are a massive fan of the genre it may not hold you attention for long.\n\nPlease checkout our full video review below: http://www.thegametutor.co.uk/videos/game-tutor-grades/160222_game-tutor-grades-dance-magic","February 21","false","5.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

The main catch to this rhythm game is the addition of strategy to your dance 'battles'. You choose whether to attack, defend, interrupt, or string together special moves by inputting combos in time with the music.  Decent visuals, controls that work alright (even without my beloved dancepad of yore), a vast song selection from artists you've never heard of, and a completely ridiculous concept combine to make this game either wonderfully terrible or terribly wonderful;  Probably a little bit of both.\n\nPros:\n+ Dance Battles - with glowy magic sparks shooting at the other guy/gal when you do it right!\n+ Rhythm Fights\n+ Tempo Tussles\n+ Fixed-Time-Interval Engagements\n+ More Dance Battles!\n\nCons:\n- Multiplayer seems completely dead (unless you plan ahead with someone you know), so single-player is where it's at.  The solo tounaments can still be pretty challenging at higher stages at least.\n\n- Dance Magic is no DDR.  The main mode is a strategic rhythm-fighting game where you simply need to stick to the beat while you input combos - no syncopated off-beat quicksteps here. While there IS a 'freestyle' mode with preset, complicated patterns to dance to, this is almost impossible to do with a controller on the harder difficulties.  Additionally, instead of the incoming steps scrolling to a point where you press them (like every other dance game ever), in this mode you must follow a blue bar down the screen which resets up to the top pac-man style, refreshing the next few measures of 'sheet music' steps at that point.  It's a clumsy design, so even if you own a PC-compatible dancemat*, showing off your crazy-mad dance skills (read: gloriously awkward flailing) to your friends/neighbors/cat probably won't be happening.\n\n*SIDENOTE:  On the plus side, you do win at life just for owning said dancemat, so kudos to you.\n\n- IMPORTANT NOTE/BUG:  Apparently the cosmetic items in the in-game-Shop can be glitched. causing the game to freeze up when you enter the 'Shop' section.  If you experience this, there IS a work-around: mash 'Spacebar' a few times as soon as you enter the Shop so the game doesn't try to load the glitched content, then press 'Tab' to reach the all-important song and character unlocks (which work just fine).  If you want to obtain the dress-up items too, you should make sure this bug has been patched before you purchase the game.\n\nReceived a free copy for testing/reviewing purposes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/recommended/394260/","Steamified","Warwick J.","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Steamified/","3916 products in account","Finally…. Dance Magic has come to Steam. If you smell what Targem Games is cookin’.\n\nNo seriously folks, those of you who are familiar with this title will know precisely where I’m coming from. And well, those of you who don’t know it, all hail the ayatollah of rock and rollah babay! Dance Magic was originally developed and released onto the PlayStation 3 back in January of 2013. It has taken over three years for Targem Games to port their rhythm-music title onto the PC and eventually sell it on Steam. Really, you cannot blame them entirely. While there are quite a number of rhythm games as a genre on Steam there are not very many dance specific rhythm games on the platform. Therefore porting the game to PC for sale on Steam – and elsewhere – was always going to be a bit of a gamble. Therefore Steam users will have raised an eyebrow when they saw Targem Games name attached to a rhythm title. The self-publisher has action, racing, strategy and RPG games with having published such titles as Planets Under Attack, Battle Mages and Hard Truck Apocalypse / Ex Machina.\n\nSo what do you need to know about the game that isn’t listed under the Steam description? To begin with there are three game formats available to you to begin with at the beginning of play including Tournament, Battle and Dance modes.\n\nIn tournament mode you play against a computer AI and when you win you earn in game currency which enables you to purchase cosmetic additions for your characters. The cosmetics that are available for purchase are different for each character, for example, Reaper has a number of different scythes that she is able to wield while dancing whereas Macho has a number of canes available to him among other pieces of cosmetics including hats, shirts, etc. It’s pretty cool and a nice way of making tournaments worth their while. Tournaments are what Targem Team label ‘campaigns’ in the Steam description but are called tournaments in game.\n\nBattle mode includes skirmish – basically a one round version of tournament mode – as well as multiplayer. I’m not certain why a player who is battling the AI would choose to play skirmish mode instead of tournament mode because the reward for playing is better in tournament mode. I suppose it’s a decent way to practice but I’d prefer tournament mode.\n\nThere is also dance mode. This is my favorite mode because I believe that it is set up better. It is much easier to tell the rhythm of the game in this mode and you are given a defined key to press in rhythm to the music. I found this mode to be much more enjoyable. I found that the way in which the rhythm stuff is set up in tournament and battle modes to be rather annoying. There is a significantly higher barrier to entry for that mode than there is for dance mode. As such I tended to play it a lot more. The good news is that when you are ready to play at a higher difficulty setting in dance mode there are global leaderboards that you can target. This means that there is a level of competition in the most basic of modes. Of course, it would be nice if you could unlock in game currency in this mode making it possible to avoid tournament mode altogether if you wanted to unlock the cosmetics. That you’re locked into playing tournament mode is a bit of a downer.\n\nIn all though, I’m quite thankful that Targem Games finally ported their game onto PC and made it available on Steam. It’s a really good dance game that deserves an opportunity if you enjoy this type of game. Unfortunately as I do not currently possess a dance mat I don’t know whether or not they work with the game. However, given that tournament mode requires the press of the left and right thumbsticks I’m guessing that the answer to that would be a negative. It’s still a very enjoyable game without one.\n\nFor our popular daily giveaways and similar reviews head over to http://www.steamified.com/\n\nTo begin your journey through our myriad of social media join our Steam Group","March 16","true","4.2"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xeunaise/recommended/394260/","xeunaise","🌸 Nadja 🌸","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xeunaise/","425 products in account","At the point of writing this review, I have clocked 55 minutes into the game.\n\nNow, let's talk about the game. I bought this game at the price of a special promotion, probably some launch discount of something. Frankly speaking, I enjoyed what I paid for and I'm not even done with the single player mode yet. There are some things in game that can be better improved on, or simply if it was different. But that's just my two-cents that you should hold an objective view to.\n\nFirst off, music. It's a vital part of any music genre game and here's the verdict. What comes with the game are great and there's a few genres of it to fit the theme of the characters implemented. They sound great, and fluid. No stutter or rubbish. Now that's brilliant in my view. And if you prefer a little extra, you get to play your own songs you already own in your computer by dragging into a game specific folder, and calibrate the bpm(beats-per-minute) yourself in-game. I played Alexandra Stan's Mr. Saxo Beat for custom and it was a smooth process of preparation and play all the way to end with no faults on my loaded music after import. So music is a pass in my point.\n\nNext, we have graphics. Runs well on my computer with fluidity and and no tearing or stuttering. It's colourful and attractive, and fits the overall theme conveyed by the game. Character textures are great, so there's no accidental intersection of the 3D models, or at least I don't really have time to look at the models while attempting to keep with what's happening. I have no complaints and don't really have much take on this, but it's still a pass in my view.\n\nThen, we have the all important gameplay. I have a complaint or two, but it's nothing major. Or could be, but here's my take. It's relatively simple and easy to catch on, and the tutorials are short and sweet. Tthat's a plus. Now what's interesting and different about this game is that, you may compare Dance Magic to other music dance battle games like Bust-A-Groove, Audition, whatever. It's almost similar. But here, you don't just enter keys as quickly as you can to match the keys that grow increassingly long in length to finish within a beat. The keys are provided for you, and they're always there and same, but you must follow the beat of the flashing metronome or you'll strike a miss before you even know what's happening. It's fresh, and I like it. Although, I would consider it a plus if keys actually do change after every completion of a set. As per things are now, I could memorise the keys, close my eyes and follow the beats and still win because there's not much of a challenge, however enjoyable it still is.\n\nThere are two modes in the game. Battle and freestyle. Oh, how interesting isn't it. But really, it is. They're two completely different modes of gameplay. Battle would be close to the gameplay mechanic I have described above, and freestyle is more like the DDR(Dance Dance Revolution) kind of gameplay, except directional arrows don't float up or anywhere. It simply stays there. And since I'm on point with the freestyle, let me start from here. I have a major complaint about this mode, but some would think otherwise. Freestyle mode sets a pink window with the directional keys for tapping at the precise beat of the song as a single glowing blue bar repeatedly flows down and back from top again, signalling the time to hit your keys. The window is locked to the left of your screen. That's fine. You get to enjoy the view of your dancer and the vivid backgrounds. Unfortunately, my complaint is that sometimes the flashing of lights or even a whole screen full of confettis can distract you. Maybe I'm just more easily distracted. Fine. But sometimes these distractions affect so that I can't focus on where the blue glowing bar is because there's too much going on in the screen at that moment. Fine, maybe it's just me.\n\nAnd here's about the battle mode. It's basically what you know about music dance battle games like the earlier examples I've aforementioned. But here's what makes Dance Magic stands out. Like I said, this isn't a test of your godspeed fingers. It's about recognising beats and with that, you battle out with your opponents with moves of attacks, defenses, and interruptions. These are fresh concepts, and I like them. There are specialty moves that deal extra damage or buffs you. They may also be a great way to boost combo meter, and only considerable if they are defense and interruptions. They can rack up combos easily and help break opponent shields to get attacks through. Combos can also help you deal extra damage, but attack specialties themselves can sometimes K.O. your opponent faster than racking combos and dishing damage. But that's sometimes. There's no timer if you don't press a key and that means no miss. So watch what's happening on screen, but be smart with the real time battle. So back on point with the mechanic, I've also mentioned earlier it's not anymore challenging with the same set of keys, lest the increase of bpm on difficulty. But if I've to make a choice, I prefer this mode over the freestyle.\n\nNarrations are all over the game, which isn't that bad, but it isn't always great. In battle modes, I have found that with my focus everywhere when things get messy, they help you by letting you know what is happening at the moment. When you're missing, stunned, ready to stun or when you're doing fine, the narration can be all over but may help. When it comes to freestyle, I have no clue what it serves for. It's distracting, and sometimes narrated at a point it disrupts your rhythm and voila, I missed. I don't need a person to tell me I'm a legend or amazing or that my mom would be proud of me the whole time I'm trying to focus on where my glowing blue bar is to prevent a miss. So there, it's not that bad, but I wasn't a fan. At least his voice wasn't hard on my ears. A-ok. Perfects, greats and misses could have had different sound effects too.\n\nYou're probably wondering by now, "When are you going to talk about the multiplayer?" Well, here's your answer. I never got down to experience it because no servers were ever found for me. It's relatively sparse, considering the game is new and on assumption that not a lot of people own it. Here's hoping I'll find a friend or two to play with me so I can earn me some achievements along the way. But here's the good news. You can play multiplayer for both battle and freestyle. So take your pick guys, and get on those leaderboards when you find an opponent to play with.\n\nLastly, you're going to question about individuality in the game. Sure, customisations are minimal and most-importantly-not-ugly, and are readily available with no garbage micro-transactions. I sincerely hope there would be more than what's readily available in the future, but I have a good feeling that may come with micro-transactions. I mean, as much as we like an all-in-one package or freebies, you can't always expect a developer to dish out more than you're paying for. It's not always fair. But that's beside the point. One complaint I have, however minor, it would be extremely pleasing to eye if the developers could give each shop item their own skin icon instead of using the default skin icon for every single item listing. It's somewhat troublesome to click on every single item to see it dressed on your character in the shop, no matter the name of the item on list. It makes shopping easier, really.\n\nSo, I mean, all in all, it's not a bad game but may not be everyone's jam. It wasn't what I thought it was, but still enough fun to keep me going. I had secretly harboured the wish and desired that freestyle was closer to the battle mode, and similar to games like Bust-A-Groove or Audition instead of the DDR style, but here's what makes it unique as Dance Magic. There can be improvements, maybe new characters or songs, but for whatever it was priced and offered in game at release? Sure. I'll recommend it.","February 20","true","2.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"
