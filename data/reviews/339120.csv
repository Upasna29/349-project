I'm going to try to describe it properly. Ignore absolutely EVERYTHING else you have read about the game, including the official description.\n\nI don't know who Fork Parker is at all and you don't have to either. He's a crotchety looking bald guy in a suit who has to climb a mountain and will probably die a lot, but has loads of checkpoints along the way and infinite lives. Yep, it's an indie platformer.\n\nBut wait, wait, wait. There's a gimmick here and it's actually quite clever. Fork can shoot pitons. Wherever they land, a rope will immediately connect the two pitons, up to about three ropes. He slides along these ropes with his cane, so momentum along the ropes is important to consider even though you can jump jump jump to climb a downward facing rope.\n\nSo you are making your own platforms generally. And it's good fun too.\n\nThe game is about an hour and a half long, with speedrunning, no death, full collection achievements out there. It's quick, to the point, and good fun, so replayability is solid. The difficulty curve is slow and steady, but it definitely ends tougher than it begins. At the base of the mountain you can climb without even firing a piton and toward the top everything is spikes so you are leaping from rope to rope.\n\nThe controls aren't perfect. The rope sliding physics are a bit irritating, but for the most part it is a fun game. It is definitely worth your time.","January 1, 2015","true","2.8"," 53 of 66 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","53","66","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Darkhalen/recommended/339120/","Darkhalen","Darkhalen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Darkhalen/","737 products in account","A mixture of rainbow island meets super meat boy, Fork Parkers Holiday Hike basically acts as a simulator game to Devolver Digitals CFO Fork Parker. The story here is that as CFO Fork has been tasked by the other board members to increase Digitals revenue for the 4th fiscal quarter; what entails after is a long trek throughout a perilous mountain attacked by various ice dwelling creatures such as Penguins, Yeti's, Cool dude snowmen (who look suspiciously like Cool spot) and sentient holiday sweaters!\n\nFork must carefully outmanoeuvre these threats as well as the various environmental hazards that litter the mountain, in his bid to reach the summit and obtain the most profit he possibly can. When playing as fork the game acts like Super meat boy; Fork can walk and jump however holding down the run button allows Fork to run faster and jump greater distances he also has a wall jump and slide ability that allows him to navigate tricky crevices and platforms, additionally for harder to reach places Fork can place hiking ropes (up to 3 at a time) around the environment.\n\nBy attaching ropes to two hard surfaces fork can create a pulley line that allows him to zip from one end to the other, this is where the real skill of the game comes into play, it becomes more and more necessary to place ropes around areas to avoid traps and progress up the summit, as the player progresses the need to use the ability of rope zipping becomes more crucial; the game luckily eases you into things at the start of the summit you're just required to put a couple of ropes down and move from A to B, later on however things become much more frantic with Fork required to place down various ropes between two pillars of spikes, the idea is that you're learning the skills comfortably at the start of the game which become essential and more frantic in the later halves. Additionally like Forks running skills the ropes hook placement can also be affected by velocity, holding the run button/key while firing a hook will increase it's range and speed and it will become paramount that players correctly understand and identify where their hooks need to go.\n\nOverall Fork Parkers Holiday Hike is a fun, solid little adventure, it's difficult, just like the games it takes it's cues from but there's a deeply satisfying feeling to being stumped in one area and then overcoming the problem with some thorough thinking and creative use of the rope mechanic. Death serves a rather comedic detriment as in SMB this game is more about overcoming the challenges and your own foibles than relentlessly punishing you, checkpoints are plentiful and the game is designed fairly; when you fail you feel like it was your own fault as opposed to the game, still the difficulty can be a turn off for some.\n\nAs a free game you really can't go wrong with FPHH, it exudes charm and finally gives Devolvers charismatic Fork Parker a day in the limelight, really when all is said and done this game offers a nice little diversion from the larger Steam sales currently on offer, I wholeheartedly recommend everyone to pick this game up and give it a try!","December 18, 2014","true","1.2"," 47 of 58 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","47","58","0","0"

In fact, I would say the movement should be smoother than it is now. Grabbing all the money took a lot of trial and error and even if replaying the game, it's pretty hard to grab all of it especially in one run if you want to get all achievements... I could only play the game in short bursts because the last few obstacles were rather frustrating to to do for the first time without proper strategy.\n\nThere are a few bugs that can cause death, for example getting stuck under a block of snow (not the pure snow block, but ground one). Probably intended, but jumping on snowballs can be frustrating; sometimes although it looks like you jump directly on top of them, you don't - and die instead.\n\n9/10\n\nEdit: After my second run I discovered that if you hold shift while placing your ropes, you can throw it extra far... finding this out made the game much easier.\n\nOn my first run the game took an hour, on the second run 26 minutes, on third run 15 minutes and on the fourth I cleared it in 10.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DonkeyBlade/recommended/339120/","DonkeyBlade","Glass Grave Jack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DonkeyBlade/","869 products in account","When it comes to platformers I love them frustratingly hard. Fork Parker's Holiday Profit Hike delivers on difficulty, and is free, so there's little reason for you to dislike it. Super Meat Boy often came to mind whilst playing\n\nThe gameplay is simple, you run, jump, and fire pitons to stick into the ice, creating ropes that you can slide on to better traverse obstacles. As with all platformers, the gameplay itself starts out straightforward and easy, and with your mastery of the aspects of the game and ascendance of the mountain, it will get more and more challenging\n\nThere are plenty of achievements if you're so inclined towards them as a means of proving your skill and e-peen size to the world, and they're your standard kind for platformers, beat the game without dying, speedrun the game, get all the collectibles etc\n\nThe goal of the game is to reach the top of the mountain with as much cash as possible, you lose $5000 per death and typically gain $10000 per bag with a couple of $20000 bags and 2 $100K eggs. You get a short ending based on whether you end up positive or negative by the time you reach the summit, but beyond that and the achievements tied to collection there's little incentive to grab up the bags besides the enticing sound effect they produce upon collection.\n\nI believe when it comes to platformers you have to get the controls completely 100% perfectly refined, that is your duty as a developer. FPHPH's controls are tight, but they're not perfect. Probably the most unrefined aspect of the game is enemy bopping. You can spring off the top of enemies to gain some height and immobilize them temporarily, but the problem is, you must hit the very top of the enemy, and you cannot approach them from the side to achieve this goal, or you will die and be whisked back to a checkpoint.\n\nThis got very frustrating, especially when trying to bounce off of snowballs. In any other platforming game in history, I would have been fine and dandy, but there is such a small specific hitbox for bopping enemies in this game that it feels unintuitive and unrefined.\n\nAnother thing I found somewhat unsatisfying is sliding down ropes you've created. You maintain the momentum you established when you grappled onto the rope whilst you slide down it. There are many points in the game where you must grapple from rope to rope in quick succession whilst dancing around very cramped death obstacles, and I found that 90% of the time I was killed, it was because I failed to negate my momentum fast enough by jumping off of the rope before sliding. Holding the LT on a controller will make you lose all momentum and stay still on the ground whilst running, but has no effect whilst sliding on ropes. I feel like this would have been a very good addition and made deaths feel far more fair\n\nLook the game's free, and will get you past a boring afternoon, so I recommend this game to platforming fans, expect enjoyment, but don't expect the second coming of Super Meat Christ","January 11, 2015","true","2.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

Fork Parkers Holiday Profit Hike is definitely a game for a true masochist.  This is not necessarily a good thing however. The game is fun, but it goes about difficulty by making the level design poor and the controls feel super clunky. The majority of your deaths might not even end up being your fault, I cant count how many times I died because my character decided he wanted to grab a ledge or rope even when your trying to avoid that very thing!  I imagine its not that big of a deal because the game is free though, after all generally speaking price = quality in most cases. In the end I feel that Fork Parker's Holiday profit Hike is a decent platformer and  I recommend this game for people who like platformers and probably frustration.\n\n\nEDIT: It seems there may be a bug involving passing through ropes and jumping at this time. I dont know if this has been fixed or not by the time you are reading this, but I see a few people reporting similar issues at the time of writing this review. Who knows what may come of it? Maybe a patch or something if its not an isolated issue.","January 9, 2015","true","2.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

I have to say, I was quite pleased with it. For a free offering it's very well designed, with some interesting (and fun) mechanincs.\n\nKeyboard controls aren't great, but they do recommend playing it with a controller, so I won't complain about that. For what it's worth I used a PS2 controller, and it worked perfectly.\n\nBottom line is I would recommend this one. I should also note that it only saves at checkpoints, so if you're having trouble with some of the trickier achievements, you can return to the menu from the options and retry as many times as you like. It might not be as satisfying as doing it legit, but it worked for me, and will save you a lot of time and frustration.","December 26, 2014","true","5.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This is a great holiday game with awesome mechanics (not to mention the graphics are retroey-goodness).

At least add a life system considering everything\nis pretty much is so its really hard to control movement\n-Ropes can sometimes glitch\n-Needs tutorial. At least an intro level.\n\nThats really all I have after my current experiance of the game.

The bittersweet taste of this melodic symphony of utter BS, creativity, wanting, and complete disregard for (my) feelings makes me feel not only at home, but also 6 feet under. This game gave me an insurmountable amount of rage, rivaling that of a school janitor when they see someone ♥♥♥♥ on the floor. So yeah, I recommend it to everyone.

The game is a masterpiece. The immense detail and work put into every pixel of your hike is mind-blowing. I was amazed by the great visial representation of Fork Parker's face. Though the visuals may be extraordinary, the story was what really captivated me. Fork Parker must go though many segments of emotional and physical pain to achieve his important goal of profit. Fork is caught between his love for profit and the holiday spirit of giving, forcing Fork to decide if the hike is really all about the profit, or giving. The story is an incredibly detailed drama/action adventure with a side of romance (Fork and his profit) that left me thinking about it for days after I completed my first hike. Now, let's move on to the soundtrack. I remember being blown away when I first started up the game and hearing the amazing and exquisite original soundtrack.\n\nCons:\nHonestly, the game has no flaws, other than sometimes I find myself wishing for more profit.\n\nVerdict:\nOverall, the game is a MASTERPIECE. It contains hours of story, captivating gameplay mechanics, and profit hiking.\n\n10/10 Perfection.","February 14, 2015","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has few elements which reminds me of DuckTales, such as being a grumpy old man who collects money bags and able to jump on top of enemies. What makes this game unique is that you're constantly ascending the mountain, so it all takes place in one level.\n\nThe game has a lot of checkpoints. If you stop and come back, it loads from the last checkpoint, so it isn't too difficult or unfair.\n\nThe game also allows the player to experiment how to get over some parts with different solutions (such as using the rope vs. jumping/wallkicks or gaining momentum from enemies). The real challenge comes from trying to get top on the mountain with positive balance without dying too much.\n\nThe only issue with the game was its huge resolution which can't be adjusted normally, so I wish it had proper display settings.","December 25, 2014","true","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lives are unlimited however every time you die you lose a small portion of Mr. Parker's hard-earned cash. The sum total you earn can even go down to the negatives which would lead to a sad, tearful ending so should you reach the top of the mountain with zero or negative money.\n\nThere's the basic platforming that works and controls very well, and then there's the fancy pitons that Mr. Parker can utilize. The pitons are thrown to make ropes as they land on a proper surface when at least two are out (four max can be out as the earliest one will disappear when another is thrown) and then be used for various purposes such as reaching higher spots by climbing the piton-made ropes or going over obstacles with them.\n\nIt's free, the gameplay's very decent, you play as a very agile Fork Parker, and it's Christmas-y.","December 7, 2015","true","8.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I pray to Fork everyday. Fork is love, Fork is life.\n\nBut in all honesty, Fork Parker's Holiday blah blah blah (I'll call it Fork P. from now on,) is pretty amazing. Not being the best at platforms, I found Fork P. to be a fairly hard challenge, and I'm yet to beat the game. The start may discourage some, as I did find some trouble changing the controls (I just got used to the current ones) and a lot of the challenges are very hard. But once I took a second to breath, and realize that Fork P. is meant as a game, it became a lot more enjoyable.\n\nThe pixelized game design has a very retro appeal, which is suited nicely with the music. The opening scene is very funny and shows light to some laughable sarcasm. The enemies are fun, and the way the map is laid out, some sections with enemies are very hard to complete. I have no issues there.\n\nWhat shines out in the game are definitely the ropes. Without the ropes, the game is impossible to beat. The ropes makes me feel like I'm a middle aged Spiderman, soaring through the mountain as I die over and over again.\n\nI rate it an 8.5/10. It's very fun, and although I didn't like it at first, give Fork P. a try. Trust me.","May 21","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

NO! It's challenging! "Fork Parker's Holiday Profit Hike" is hard!\nA platformer inspired by 80-90's classics like "Balloon Fight" & "Ice Climber" and modern "Super Meat Boy" aswell, this brings you a new level of challenge with usage of ropes and pitons.\nMore likely recommend because not much of these are coming out nowadays.","May 15","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
