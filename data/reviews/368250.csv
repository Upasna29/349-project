And so your adventure begins in this RPG.\nThe plot unfolds pretty quickly, and there are plenty of twists and surprises to keep the story fresh and exciting.\nAnd, as with all RPGs, the story has to be interesting for all the other elements to be successful ---- on this level the game easily delivers.\nYou find yourself in a strange but beautiful land in the clouds as you pursue different characters, search for various items, explore many diverse areas, and battle enemies to find the path to resurrecting your princess.\n\n\nIt's not easy (but never boring or frustrating) to navigate your course through the various locations as there are several puzzle-like elements to solve as you search and explore. In fact, the exploration of the locations is one of the best aspects of the game featuring several "a-ha" moments as you discover the correct path or reveal one of the secret rooms for various important treasures. Careful exploration is key to your ultimate success, and there are a ton of side quests that weave into the story seamlessly to help you along the way. And a quest log is provided so you know exactly what to do.\n\n\nThe characters in your party I've met so far are likeable ---- even the dragon used to transport you around the clouds of Asteria.\n\n\nThe battles are well planned, and require a degree of thoughtful strategy which only adds to the interest of the game.\n\n\nThe art work is beautifully detailed, and the music is quite good.\n\n\nSo, a great story with an involving plot that features many surprises, tons of exploring to do with different and fun characters, and a game that obviously has been carefully and well thought out add up to an excellent RPG experience. Recommended.","May 10, 2015","true","5.8"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","92","22","24","0","0"

It's such a nice little game, not too long and not too short, has a nice story, nice characters and plenty of old school charm.\n\nValiant: Resurrection actually feels like it was very much inspired by Lufia 2: Rise of the Sinistrals.  Agro is a hero that is much like Maxim, who goes around saving places from powerful beings.  Except in Agro's case it is the fallen titans and his end goal is to bring back the woman he loves.  The dungeons also are simlar with the puzzles to solve within them.  The overall feel of doing all sorts of small things to accomplish a greater goal and watching as your hero earned the trust and adoration of numerous people as he traveled from place to place just felt very much the same and in a good way.\n\nYou'll do a bunch of little quests to help out the people of each place you go to.  A good amount of the game is just doing stuff for others whether it be helping to prepare for a wedding, healing a queen or trying to earn the trust of another leader to gain information.  It was nice to be able to go around and just help people out and it really fleshed out the culture of Asteria quite nicely and in a game as short as this it was refreshing to see a well built world with interesting races and cultures.  A human like Agro was actually something unusual for Asteria which is a world filled with many unusual races like mermaids, harpies, spectres, frozen, ifrits and more.\n\nThe game is overall about 10 hours long.  It didn't feel too rushed or too drawn out, more just about right, though truly I wouldn't have minded a bit more since it was so enjoyable.  About the only major objection I had was that the game was overall a bit on the easy side.  None of the puzzles were too difficult, no achievements were missable or too hard or required grinding.  As long as you didn't excessively avoid the random monsters in the dungeons and didn't skip most of the sidequests the game was quite fair and balanced.\n\nOverall pros:\n+NIce setting, story and characters\n+Party was well-balanced and each character is useful and good in battle\n+Interesting setting and world-building.  The world seemed to come alive more as you explored and progressed\n+Wonderful old school charm, very reminiscent of classics like Lufia 2\n+Lots of stuff to do, plenty of optional quests, hidden secrets and even an optonal boss\n\n\nOverall drawbacks:\n-A bit too easy, strategy for bosses was sometimes a bit repetetive.\n-A bit on the short side at 10 hours to get 100% of the achievements\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game to fans of old school RPGs and games made in RPG Maker.  It's definitely a nice little hidden gem that will keep you entertained as you discover more about Asteria and save its people from the fallen titans.  Also for people like me who like achievements, it's a very reasonable game to 100% and all the achievements work perfectly.\n\nAlso, since I did buy the guide as well, I will add a small note about it.  Very wonderfully written guide that was a very complete walkthrough and included all the secrets.  I only found one error in the whole thing and it was just an optional treasure chest that has special conditions to unlock (said chest requires having found gnome rooms 1-20) to open it.  The game doesn't absolutely require it to find everything or get the achievements, but it is a nice addition if you want to find all the secrets or are having trouble with a dungeon.","September 22, 2015","true","12.0"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Submarine_Argument/recommended/368250/","Submarine_Argument","Submarine_Argument","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Submarine_Argument/","397 products in account","Valiant: Resurrection is a solid RPG that has an interesting world and characters.  Despite taking only about 10 hours to complete, the game does a great job of presenting a very unique world that is well detailed and fun to explore.  The world feels very different and isn't a typical take on a generic fantasy world.  There's numerous optional side quests that flesh out the game and don't feel like chores.  The story for the game is interesting.  It starts out a little clich√© but quickly gets more complex past the first hour.   The bosses are challenging, especially the first two in the game.  There's no need to grind XP or items really, the game follows a pretty natural progression.  The economy is tight, espeically early on but eventually you'll have enough money to get everything you need.\n\nThe main character is likeable and the other characters are interesting.  Combat is pretty standard stuff.  Strategy is mostly needed for the boss battles.  There's 13 achievements which are all pretty easy to get.  I would recommend the guide, however, since it helps if you get stuck or lost and it gives good info on the side quests and 30 optional hidden gnome rooms.  As far as negatives, I found the music to just be standard, not exceptional.  There isn't much variety in monsters fought in dungeons, but you don't have to do too much fighting in the game.   I noticed several typos / grammar errors towards the end of the game.  Other than that, it was a very solid game.  If you like oldschool RPGs, I highly recommend Valiant: Ressurrection.  It has a good plot, fun characters, and a unique setting that makes it a great 10 hour rpg romp.  In fact, I almost didn't want the game to end!","September 29, 2015","true","13.0"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

And it is! If only for the story (and the dragon) Valiant is worth playing.\n\nOk, Warfare Studios aim more for the casual players, so the game was a bit too easy to my taste. But it was definitively solid - good story, various locations, side-quests and secret rooms there and there. Maybe the quest descriptions could have been better sometimes.\nAnyway, it was fun, so my verdict: recommended.","May 27, 2015","true","12.6"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DazeOfWar/recommended/368250/","DazeOfWar","Daze The Bear Chieftain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DazeOfWar/","4588 products in account","Valiant: Resurrection is the story of a man who falls in love and right before he and his bride are to be married she falls ill and dies. You then journey across the world to save her.\n\nYou will meet many different characters and that will constantly ask you for favors. Some small tasks and some requiring a little more time. This is a good way to find gear that can help you out throughout the game. You can also buy better gear in each area you visit.\n\nLike all RPGMaker games there isn't much more to the graphics than the old school 2D look. It doesn't take away from the game though. Story was decent and interesting at least. Only issue I really saw was spelling and grammar would get bad in some conversations. The worst of it was at the end of the game. This also doesn't really take away from the game but it is something I have to point out and probably should have been checked over better.\n\nOverall it's a pretty good game and worth a playthrough if you like the old school rpg games. You can beat the game in under 9 hours but if you want a 100% then plan on probably a few more hours.","April 4","true","13.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"
