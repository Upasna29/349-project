"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/recommended/327060/","rgk","rgk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rgk/","357 products in account","Feist is a physics platformer starring little critters in a forest, with a visual style of black silhouettes against a colored background, as in Badlands for example. Or a bit like Limbo since so many people refer to Limbo and say it is a rip-off, but the games have nothing in common. Limbo is monochrome, and beyond that there is no fighting in Limbo as it is a puzzle platformer.\n\nThe aim of Feist is to take down several beasty creatures (the biggest ones on the screenshots) to recover the main character's significant other. In order to do so, the player will travel through a forest and a mine, and fight all the wildlife in the way while avoiding a few traps here and there. To compensate for its weak stature and lack of direct combat abilities, the main creature can pick up twigs or rocks to fight.\n\nA specific enemy, the fly, can be caught and used as a way to throw darts at enemies. This is really great. Also, the fights against the main beasts are very challenging and provide a lot of tension. Very dangerous boss fights.\n\nHowever, the rest of the enemies, especially the worms that come out of the ground to throw darts, are not so interesting to deal with. They lack some form of interactivity (in contrast to the flies), and end up being a hassle and repetitive. Especially in the sections where the platforming bits are really not fun as well. Too many platforms that need to swing to an exaggerate extent, unlike the more interesting puzzles of Trine. Having to pick up items to fight is original, but after a while it feels too limited since the twigs break all the time while the enemies keep sending projectiles. More enemy types and big scary creatures (that cannot be beaten?) would be welcome as well.\n\nFor a game centered around wildlife, I thought that the ecosystem would be more complex, with the possibility to observe some of their life independent from the player, and creatures fighting each other. Actually I imagined that this would be a game mechanic, to distract the creatures by triggering some infighting. I believed that this would be the case because the boss beasts are able to squish the other creatures in their way. Sadly, every single creature just aims at the player and it feels too much like a set piece rather than an organic world. Additionally, I would say that the fights could be visually a bit more brutal to reflect the struggle for life among creatures.\n\nThe irony is that my negative criticism of the game comes from what the game does right, like the beast fights, the flies, the traps, and the overall atmosphere (music and visuals) that put the basic bricks of a great world to play in. Sadly, the bricks are not expanded upon and not used together to build a house. The game doesn't capitalize on its strong points, and despite being short (2-4h) it seems very full of filler and not enough substance. In other words, it doesn't live up to its potential.\n\nOn a technical standpoint, the game can run well above 60 FPS, however I had some occasionaly heavy framerate drops (that resolve themselves pretty quickly) and rare crashes or visual glitches. Nothing really bad.\n\nMy negative recommendation is not to say that this is a bad game. Just that it could have been much better, and I suggest waiting for a sale if you want to experience it for its original features that set it apart from the other platformers.","July 26, 2015","false","15.3"," 320 of 418 people (77%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","77","320","418","11","8"

Because of the way it looks, moodily lit with silhouette-based graphics, Feist initially seems reminiscent of LIMBO. But this is misleading. At heart, Feist is a totally different sort of game. Its core is not meditative puzzle solving but a near-frantic brawl. This is not without charm, but the significant difficulty of the fight mechanics made the game very tense and kept me from enjoying the game as much as I hoped.\n\nIn Feist you play as the forest-dwelling fur-ball version of Rambo. (‘Feist’ in Geman means round and furry, while in English ‘Feisty’ means aggressive. Both fit.) A band of creatures somewhere between molls and trolls have locked you in a cage and abducted your kin. You are following their column on its march through the wilderness, confronting them one by one.  The terrain is filled with spikey, hostile creatures that make quick work of tiny fur-balls like you. You fight back with your superior agility and make-shift weapons: swinging sticks, throwing stones, even getting them to shoot one another with stingers.\n\nThese breathless fights with catch-as-catch-can armaments are the centerpiece of play. The enemies have decent AI, meaning that things actually aim at you effectively, dodge unpredictably, or form swarms which follow you when you try to engage too many at once. The weapons also pose a big challenge. Many are one use: sticks break easily and, once thrown, projectiles must be retrieved. One can improvise a sort of gun by wounding a stinging fly and then picking it up, but these too can easily be destroyed or, worse, escape mid-fight to attack you further. This means that battle is a constant flit from one armament to another, dodging all the while, hoping that your scant hit points see you through. Then there are the moll-trolls themselves, tough bosses who are faster on their feet than you and can absorb significant damage before going down.\n\nI like this idea in principle. It brings a gritty bar-fight sensibility to a platformer. But in practice it is wicked hard; a bit too hard for my taste. Some encounters early in the game took a frustrating number of attempts before I was able to win through, and even then my victory felt lucky. Getting struck in a fight causes you to drop whatever weapon you are currently holding, and you can’t carry more than one, so when the fight starts to turn against you it’s hard to even fight back. Admittedly, this does make each fight you walk away from feel like a triumph—there is no perfunctory combat in Feist. This game is definitely not for those who aren’t already seasoned platformer veterans.\n\nThe aesthetics of the game, on the other hand, were immediately enjoyable. The almost-silhouette graphics are done in a limited color palate, mostly blacks, whites, and shades of green. Care has been taken to give the illusion of depth and with extras like the texture of reflections in rough water. The world of Feist is damp and moody, and the music compliments this atmosphere. Also worth noting are the wonderful designs of the moll-trolls (I find myself wishing they were good guys).\n\nOne stray complaint in this department is the odd way enemies explode into pine-needles when killed. Feist’s combat seems so staunchly grounded and then this adds to it a discordantly dreamy effect.\n\nTo sum up, Feist is pretty to look at, and challenging to play. For somebody looking for a gritty, combat-centric take on the platformer, it would be a very enjoyable game. To me, who struggled through the initial difficulty curve, it was a moderately enjoyable one.\n\n[Disclosure: I received a review copy of Feist from the developer.]","August 26, 2015","true","3.6"," 71 of 74 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","71","74","2","0"

It's rather Limbo-like but fails to capture the same atmosphere that made LIMBO special.\n\nEven so FEIST is not a bad game per say, I rather enjoy it. The art style is lovely, the music and ambience great, and the backdrop and environment is actually rather nice.\n\nIt's a fun little platformer, where you play a feisty little furball that's recently escaped a trap and is now trying to escape this strange forest that's filled with hostile creatures. The AI is rather good, and certain enemies will relentlessly hunt you down, and even throw you against objects to try and kill you. You actually use the same method to try and defeat them, as you can pick up sticks to use as weapons. Although they break after contact with an enemy. Or you can pick up pine cones, and small logs to use as projectile weapons. At the same time the most irritating enemy I've ran into is the fly, they'll relentlessly pursue you, and fire projectiles at you.\nThey're also rather difficult to kill as a stick won't kill them with one hit. It will bring them down, and then you can pick them up and actually use them as a weapon.\nWhile extremely annoying to face you can use them against other creatures, especially the large murderous furballs. Throw a fly against them and you'll turn the two against each other, and  you've done some damage to the large monstrosity. They are usually the bosses at the end of levels, so try with all your might to get past them.\n\nThe combat is entirely reliant on the games physics engine, and while it's not super complex it does a great job. Hitting enemies, moving boulders, and throwing objects all have decent velocity, impact and gravity attached to them, and without it the game would be horribly I feel.\nThe physics engine is also reliant on it, and you can move logs, stack rocks, or use these sticky plant seeds/pods to make little platforms.\n\nSo what's the main issue with FEIST? Well despite it being charming, and fun for a little platformer with physics based puzzles and combat; it's just too short. The game clocks in at 2.5 hours unless you've gotten stuck or died too many times. This makes it rather hard to justify the price tag of €15.\n\nAdd in that the game; while charming just doesn't capture you the way LIMBO did it makes it awfully hard to say whether it's really worth the price. Personally I enjoy the game, I actually find it somewhat relaxing. Even the combat is strangely relaxing. It's not intense, and the mood of the game; along with it's ambience and subtle music is rather soothing.\n\nPC Gameplay\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3FtRpgto6c","July 23, 2015","true","2.9"," 41 of 54 people (76%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","76","41","54","5","0"

If you find yourself unable to scale some high terrain, find some things hanging from trees which resemble giant, hairy testes, and hurl them at the side of said cliff-face (they're sticky) to help you traverse said terrain.  And whatever you do, DON'T anger the gigantic, furry porcupine men...'cause gigantic, furry porcupine men will ♥♥♥♥ YOU UP.\n\nSome even more surprising things which I've learned playing Feist thus far:  It is entirely possible for someone to make a game which superficially "looks" a bit like Limbo, and somehow make that game very nearly as GOOD as Limbo without replicating its gameplay too slavishly.  You can, for example, add quite a bit of "combat" to said game, whilst still replicating the highly believable physics and logical puzzle-solving of a game like Limbo.  Even more amazingly, you can make this new game seem oddly FRESH, in spite of the fact that it owes so much to not only Limbo, but indeed many a 2D, side-scrolling puzzle-platformer before it.  And all that's required to pull off this amazing feat is an extraordinary level of talent and an all-too-obvious "labour of love" work ethic evidenced only by the most dedicated of "artists".\n\nSO WHY IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF ♥♥♥♥ ON STEAM NOWHERE NEAR AS GOOD AS THIS?!?\n\nWell, that's a question I simply cannot answer.  But by supporting game developers as talented and hard-working as this, maybe we can turn that trend around.  My only regret is that I didn't buy the soundtrack at the same time as the game, 'cause it sounds like JOHN ♥♥♥♥ING CARPENTER...oh man, me and my first-world problems...\n\nVerdict: 9.5/10.","July 24, 2015","true","4.4"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","80","32","40","14","2"

This game might remind you of Limbo, as it has very similar graphics and gameplay.\nIf this review is too long for you, I suggest you to only read the first paragraph about the game's content and the final verdict at the end.\n\nWhat is happening in the game:You are a cute small fluffy creature who can jump, run around, grab sticks, hit things with sticks and a lot of other fun things. You have to progress in game by solving puzzles, avoiding or beating enemies and finding a way to use the environment.\n\nPros:    Environment and Graphics | If you know Limbo, a very popular dark platformer, you probably noticed that these two games look very familiar. And, after playing both, they also offer very similar gameplay. In other words, if you loved Limbo, you will love Feist! Both games have a wonderful setting of things in the front being shadows, but Feist has a much brighter background, which is much better in my opinion.\nDifferent Enemies | Throughout the story, you will have to fight numerous enemies, each of which behaves differently. Some you want to avoid, some you have to trick into disabling themselves and some you can use against other enemies. This is a very nice addition to the gameplay, as it brings in the puzzle element.\nSoundtrack | I have to give a really big thumbs-up to the soundtrack. If a game like this doesn't have a really good soundtrack, all other advantages go to waste. The mysterious noises that accompany the game are really enjoyable, especially if you're wearing headphones, which you really should.\nControlling the Character | I'm not sure why, but I like how responsive the character is to your input. Precision jumps aren't that common in Feist, but when they are, it feels fair and doable. I also heard that this game is really good when it comes to controller support (I'll test it out when my Steam Controller arrives!).\nPerformance | This game has pretty low system requirements and it runs very smoothly on the highest quality.\nSteam and OS support | You can play Feist in any of three major operating systems. Steam delivers you Trading Cards, Achievements and Steam Cloud. Perfect!\nCons:    Freshness | I know I gave this game a lot of praise, but it's to similar to Limbo to be worth buying for full price. But if you don't own Limbo yet and you feel like this is your kind of game, definitely consider buying this.\nSoundtrack Version | On Steam Store page, you can only buy the soundtrack together with the game. In other words, if you enjoyed the game and now want to buy the soundtrack, you're screwed. The developer should really make soundtrack a DLC.\nThe final verdict:I enjoyed this game a lot, although it kind of feels like replaying Limbo once again. Feist is very atmospheric, which is one of my favourite things in video games. The soundtrack is awesome, but there is sadly no option to buy it separately.\nAs I said above, if you own Limbo and you liked it, you would definitely enjoy Feist as well, although they might be a bit too similar to be worth buying full price. If you don't own Limbo and you like games like this, definitely buy Feist.\n\nGreetings,\nBirdCute\n\nNote that my copy of this game was obtained for free for reviewing purposes.

The main character has the ability to pick up many objects from the environment and to use them against the wildlife, which behaviour reflects the atmospheric notes I wrote above. Combat in particular is a highlight point for the game, it feels brutal and desperate, with limited resources and aggressive enemies.\n\nBosses: each level has a unique bossfight at its end. Each one of them is a desperate fight for the little and harmless protagonist, so that you will have to use all the resources given and a bit of trial and error or luck to overcome them. I won't say that I liked the storyline (infact there's barely one) but these bossfights add a lot to it, making you understand how important it is for you (playable character) to rescue your companion.It runs smoothly on many setups although I had a pair of graphical glitches, but they were probably due to an outdated driver.\n\nThis are pretty much all the reasons I will give for buying this game, besides a few warnings: this is a short game (2-3 hours) with some replayability (it is AI-physics based, so every time you redo an encounter it will always play differently) and/or speedrun potential (because the AI is functional and not too difficultt to read).\n\nI suggest you to buy it at full price if you want to support this two developers, so that they can get the chance to craft even better experiences.\n\nIf you are not interested in that but you like the genre, maybe wait for a discount, but keep an eye on it because it is rather unique.\n\nBuying the soundtrack isn't a bad idea either, because it is AWESOME.\n","August 10, 2015","true","13.3"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

It's not a BAD game, but I sat down and beat it in two hours. It is a very, VERY short game. The replay value is in the fact that there's a lot of achievements for the game... if you like doing those, you could probably get quite a lot of gameplay out of it. The game's really not for me, I felt that the game forced you into combat situations too often for it to establish any sort of eerie mood. Protip: If there's an enemy in your path, kill it. Personally, I liked the first level best, before the game got overly irritating.\n\nPros: Gameplay is fluid, you never feel like you're fighting the controls.\nThe graphics are rather well done.\nLots of achievements.\nYou can beat the game in two hours.\n\nCons: The music felt like it was on a constant loop rather than actually having different songs. It's not on a loop, of course, but none of the songs sound different enough to make much of a difference.\nIt's very annoying and tries your patience rather often.\nSoils the mood by forcing you into combat too often.\nNot much enemy variety. There are a total of, I think, five actual enemies in the game excluding the big guys, which come in a few types but... that's not really variety, in my opinion. They're sort of like bosses, they kind of need to have variety.\nNot much replay value outside of achievements.\nYou can beat the game in two hours.\n\nWhat the game does it does well, which is the presentation and the controls. If you're the kind who like to show off through speed-running, this is the kind of game for you. If I had beaten the game without dying, it probably would have only taken an hour, maybe less. So, if you like fairly fast-paced platformer games I'd say check it out. Not really for me, just based on the fact that I've beaten it in under two hours and there's no replayability, because I don't care about achievements, but hey, this game certainly isn't bad.","March 12","true","1.8"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

I have to admit it went under my radar for a long time as well.\n\nThe artstyle is simply brilliant. Imagine LIMBO set in an alpine (Swiss?) forest region filled with fierce creatures and traps. The ambient soundtrack complements that atmosphere beautifully.\n\nIt has a decent options menu and allows re-mapping of input keys.\n\nThere is no obvious storyline to the game. You're a little hairy creature caught in a box by "beasts" which look like a mix of Mumintrolls, the "wild things" of "Where the wild things are" and the "Perchten" of alpine tradition. Escaping that box you wander the forest trying to survive while fighting off different creatures and the beasts themselves. Your only weapons are things found in the forest like beechnuts, sticks and rocks which can be picked up and thrown or put down. Or you might just as well lure the creatures into traps or pick up a stunned fly to shoot enemies.\n\nSurvival in this game is tough. After an easy start you'll soon find yourself replaying chapters cause you died once again. Every encounter is dynamic and you have to react appropriately making the fights a lot more fun than the usual scripted fights in indie games. Eventually it all comes down to your platforming skills and observing the patterns of the beasts. Of course there are some physics based puzzles as well. The achievements in Feist are what they are meant to be: challenges on the side. Either finish levels in "perfect" way or some "special stunts". Some of them are not too easy to get done but that's what challenges are for.\n\nIt took me roughly 7 hours to 100% the game and I'll surely play it again. Warmly recommending it for all "puzzle-platforming" fans and more generally speaking all gamers looking for unique and fun games. Maybe not for notorious rage-quitters with an attention span of not more than an hour.","October 1, 2015","true","18.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreyFear/recommended/327060/","GreyFear","Nico","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GreyFear/","150 products in account","So Feist is a good game in my opinion. Everyone compares it to limbo but honestly i find this better than Limbo. This doesnt require as much thought processing and more action and skill. The physics are amazingly realistic even though its a 3d platformer. Its about a small creature that got trapped by some beasts that are adventuring on. The aim is to kill all the beasts and save your friend and has a fun journey going through caves and forests and such, slowly picking the beasts off one by one. All the beasts have different abilities and are each unique and fun to killThough Feist does have its pros and cons so i will list them down and what to expect from the game.\n\nPros\n- Incredible Physics\n- Less thinking\n- Amazing design\n- A pretty game\n- Good enemies\n- Smooth\n- Can fight back\n- Small game size\n\nThe physics despite being a 3d platformer are realistic. The way rocks and sticks fall are actually fun and it was a big reason why i got the game. The game doesnt really require a smart brain and more skills like timing your hits and when to jump and stuff like that. The design of the game is nothing like Limbo, its in a forest and mainly nature and feels alot more peaceful, rather in Limbo it was alot of man made structures and figuring out puzzles. The enemies all are different and all have different ways of maneuvering past them. The game has a nice smooth feeling when you are jumping and you dont lose momentum of when you are running, jumping from branch to branch journeying through the forests and caves to kill the beasts. You can actually fight back unlike Limbo and pick up sticks, rocks, logs and push boulders to kill the creatures that try to stop your journey. You can also use the environment to kill creatures too. And the game size is like 300 mb\n\nCons\n- Far Checkpoints\n- Small max health\n- Overpowered Enemys\n- Small selection of weapons\n- Overload of enemies\n- Repetitive deaths\n\nSo first off the checkpoints in Feist are pretty far for the things you die loads from. You would have gone so far but then have to do it all over again because of how far the checkpoints are. Your max health doesnt help with that either. Its about 4 - 5 hits from anything to kill you. And the fact that any creature can do that and some of them are pretty overpowered with all those are pretty unfair. Also the selection of a couple items to use against creatures are pretty limited. Mostly its just a stick, log and rock. logs are like lighter versions of rocks and sticks only last one hit. Rocks slow you down and lower how high you jump. Sometimes theres times when there is far too many creatures attacking you at once. Fighting off all of those creatures can get pretty hard. Then with the overload of creatures constantly relentlessly attacking you, you have to worry about progression aswel. Killing enemies mainly helps you for most things. Not worrying about creatures is like doing homework early and not worrying about it.\n\n\nVery likely a typo slipped my mind. There are plenty of more Pros that i couldnt think of at the time. Overall i suggest you get this if you like little adventures.","August 1, 2015","true","5.5"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The game often hints at just HOW that came to be, though quite elusively, and even by the end, you are still not 100% sure just how he lost his scrotum in the first place…\n\nThe storyline is very simple; the protagonist is a descended testicle that is trying to reunite with his twin bollock. The other nut appears to have been taken by third wave feminists, represented in the game by large hairy troll like creatures, with piggish snouts and Shylock-like beady eyes.\n\nIn order to reach your scrotal friend, you will need to traverse dangerous terrain and slay the feminist hogs by 'TRIGGERING' various traps/puzzles (metaphors for coherent thought and intelligent argument) as well as by utilizing various single-use items/weapons, in other words... WORDS.\n\nThe levels, without question, are representative of the female anatomy and a particularly vile one at that (think Jo Brand after a particularly invasive gynecological procedure and add a double chicken piri piri into the equation) Level to level sees you traversing this toxic wilderness through forested mons pubis, cruel ureteral caverns and some all together; f***ing explosive bits of C**T!\n\nEnemies such as pubic lice, tapeworm and maggot infested flies will try to kill you and the feminists themselves will stop at nothing to 'bust your ball'… The gameplay is basically trying to interpret that of a flaccid dong (sausage, no hash browns) trying to spill it's pointless ooze into a large woman's proverbial axe wound.\n\nThe designer, now a sub-human, uses the game as a medium to evoke the emotions he has towards women. Particularly disease riddled feminists with only slightly more integrity left intact, than their own f***ing hymen!\n\nBasically; Feist is the story of a man's ongoing struggle to copulate with the lesser species with his all but useless genitalia. The word ‘feist’ meaning to pass gas or break wind (fart) was basically meant to symbolize the female phenomena of ‘queefing’. Chances are she probably did that while he was sliding his limp little noodle out of her or something… Anyways, it’s a good name and it fits the game perfectly... I reckon...\n\nI thoroughly enjoyed the game and found myself feeling better about myself having played it, a DEFINITE self-esteem booster. If I had one negative point to say, it’d be that the game WAS a little too short. However, I find this somewhat forgivable, since this is clearly trying to represent the fact that the designer has a problem with premature ejaculation.\n\n\nPROS:\n- Kill feminist scum!\n- Gynecology Simulator!\n- Suicide Saver!\n- You're a nutsack!\n\nCONS:\n- Shot his load too quickly! + NO creampie!!!\n\n9/10 WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND!!!\n\nP.S Perhaps the castration itself is simply a metaphor within a metaphor to explain his love/hate relationship with/for women, but I still like to theorize that a jar of peanut butter and a slightly overenthusiastic dog were somehow responsible for this whole thing...","August 8, 2015","true","3.6"," 26 of 48 people (54%) found this review helpful 41 people found this review funny","54","26","48","41","4"

I have described this as platforming with sloppy combat mechanics with charming visuals. The best part however for myself is the adorable (Hedgehog) or something :)\nThe game is vicious but if you've played Limbo then you will already know that. Take those potential deathly trap scenarios and add boss battles in the mix and you have yourself a FEIST cocktail.\n\nThere isn't a massive amount to talk about though and thats good because I shouldn't be spoiling the "Whole" game for you...

After a few levels our character will find objects he can pick up to have an easier time against his enemies.\n\nStory\nThe game does not really tell us a story, but you can end up imagining the context. Our character has lost his friend/beloved because bigger forest creatures have him captured. He begins a frenetic journey to save him.\n\n\nGameplay\nThe character has problems to face bigger enemies, that's why he must use the scneario to get an advantage, like traps, for example. Our character will pick up rocks or wooden sticks to kill his enemies.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics aspect of this game are simply gorgeous! The background is made with so much effort that you can almost feel it. The shadows all over the screen give it a really good ambient.\n\nMusic The music is produced by Tomek Kolczynski. Here you can check out the first track: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHZXc7jUn4o\n\nConclusion\nI recommend the game it´s fun, but in my opinion it's too short, only 10 levels, that can be beaten each in 20 minutes the first time.\n\nMy rating for this game is an 8.5 out of 10\n\nThe game should be a bit longer, I've finished it in 5.6 hours. I recommend picking it up for sale when it gets under $12\n\nThis review was made for  The Panda's Corner Curator Group","February 29","true","5.6"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","56","10","18","5","0"

It's clear in the trailer that you're not playing a puzzle-centric sort of game like Limbo, but more of an action game with a similar dark and ominous mood.\n\nThe subtle sounds might lull you into a false sense of security because every creature seems determined to kill the furry little hero.  It's definitely a big fish, little fish scenario.  You can consume some of the small bugs flying around if you've taken damage and the other larger monsters waste no time trying to put you down.  You are clearly the underdog in this world.  The big bad bosses are more than twice your size and surprisingly fast.  It's often a tough choice to fight or evade and run.  The flying critters remind of that taunting sun in some of the desert levels of Mario 3, harrassing you from a distance and difficult to outrun.\n\nPieces of the environment and some enemies can be used as weapons, but don't get too attached because they can break or be easily dropped.\n\nI'm not sure where the game is going with my brief playtime, but every so often you catch a glimpse of what appears to be your destination.  You look to be chasing a large group of large monsters who appear to have kidnapped a friend.  It feels like you're a lowly hobbit chasing a pack of Uruks who have kidnapped your hobbit friend.\n\nIf you're fan of 2D games, I recommend Feist.","October 23, 2015","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

At first glance, Feist looks like a lot like Limbo, however the focus here is not on puzzle solving but on combat and platforming. The levels are well designed so that running them is smooth bar the occasional obstacle or nasty beastie. Combat feels good, throwing a rock into a troll's face has weight behind it and squishing a bug with a boulder is very satisfying. The soundtrack is also brilliant, setting the mood for each encounter and environment.\n\nFeist is a well balanced, fun and atmospheric platformer that only took me a couple of hours to complete. If the length of the game is a put off for some people, there are plenty of achievments to keep you coming back. If you enjoy platformers like Limbo, be sure to give this one a go.","October 25, 2015","true","3.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Especialy lack of any HUD or health indicator makes it more difficult than necessary. The main fluffy character is quite weak and he has to rely just on throwing stones or slamming oponents with a one-use wooden stick. Beating a level boss might be therefore frustrating as hell. Sometimes you have to repeat one game stage from the last checkpoint more than 20 times.

Good gameplay, challenging and nice visuals and music.\n\nThere isn't much story in this game, but I don't think it needs any more than it has: SPOILER ALERT!  You are captured by beasts, and trapped in a cage. You must free yourself and begin your journey through the forest to save your friend/girlfriend/boyfriend.\n\nOverall I think the game was great, I beat it in 3,8 hours (according to Steam), so it isn't too long. BUT, I did not get all the achivements and whatnot, so there is replay value. And I wouldn't call myself good at this game either, so it's not too hard to beat, if you don't like difficult games.\n\nOne minor complaint I find is that sometimes the controls are a bit "floaty". You know, when you jump it doesn't stop moving to one side immediately when you stop pressing the left or right key. But not a big problem, you'll get used to it. Haven't tried it with a controller though, maybe it works even better with that?\n\nSo give the game a chance (especially if it's on sale) and begin your danger filled journey through the thick forest.\n\n(If you find this important) Score: 9,5/10\n\nPS.

Feist on the other hand is very fast paced game where everone and everything in this unique world tries to kill you.

The enemies are ruthless, visceral and highly intelligent. Not only the bosses but other fearsome creatures possess an incredibly aggressive AI, the most annoying of these are the so called spider ticks whose attacks are so vicious to the point the game can become quite frustrating.\n\nI repeated some of the chapters multiple times due to merciless nature of the enemy foes. Prepare to die a lot in this game, this isn't a walk in the park, even for an experienced gamer like myself, you'll die and you'll die a lot, but with the death comes vengeance, you'll get better with each death, memorizing each step carefully and you'll eventually become victorious.\n\nThe game itself has a a simple storyline, but this game isn't about the story, it's strongest part is the ferocious gameplay and I have to say for nearly 14 euro Iam satisfied, it took me over 3 hours and 20 minutes to beat the game, I'll probably be playing through the game once again to earn some of the achievements I missed on my first playhhrough.

Trying to beat next checkpoint for ten or more times is a usual situation. Opponents appear ouf of nowhere. They fast, or tough, or attack in mass. And usually they are ridiculously precise in shooting.\n\nOn the opposite, for you, world's low gravity creates so much of a challenge itself that throwing or shooting becomes a frustrating experience. Consider the fact that you need to catch a fly of your own size and hold it to be able to shoot its stings. Just to discover that it can shoot only at most useless angle. And the fact that to catch the damn thing, you shoot beat it half to death first.  Spending a whole damn minute trying to jump and hit it with a stick. Dodging those very damn stings like crazy. And the fact that if you release the fly, which easily happens when you're hit, or have accidentally thrown it away yourself (due to struggle with controls, but as an adult you pretend that you did it intentionally), it shakes off and joins enemies surrounding you to take its revenge.\n\nSo, it makes close combat the best option. Which means running around with a stick. Which you need to find (strangely, beating it before taking is not required). There's only one little inconvenience with a stick. It breaks down after a single hit.  And nearest supply of sticks is left a couple screens ago. And is pretty limited (of course it is! hey, what did you expect? we're in a forest! what, do you think sticks will just lay around under you feet?). And, running back there usually rewarded with an immediate couple of spears in your sorry back (who would think that caterpillars are so impressive in throwing?).\n\nConsidering that your hero can take only around 3-5 hits, it makes combat a mix of chaotic running and jumping, counting much more on lucky circumstances rather than skill. The fighting takes around 95% of play time, and there's almost no other things to do. So, after first 1.5 hours of gameplay, I'm rather irritated than having fun.\n\nFor me, apart from bizarre visual style, there are no reasons to prefer Feist over a ton of other games, unless you're Dark Souls fan or dying over and over again is an integral part of your pleasure.","July 24, 2015","false","1.5"," 5 of 22 people (23%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","23","5","22","2","0"

The major negative, besides how short it is, is that Feist is a very difficult game. This, in itself, isn't a bad thing, but it may drive away many people that would have enjoyed it otherwise. However, from a narrative standpoint, the difficulty makes perfect sense, the main character being a tiny creature fighting things much deadlier than itself. It's a shame that the combat isn't more rewarding, instead feeling more based on luck, but it serves the narrative and atmosphere well enough to be enjoyable as a whole.","September 18, 2015","true","3.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've really enjoyed it.","July 27, 2015","true","2.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Feel in love with the art style right away.\n\nTo be brief:\n+ The game looks awesome\n+ The sound is good\n+ The controls (xbox pad) work fine\n+ The main enemies (hedgehog things) are a really neat design\n+ I only ever had 1 bug (flickering background, checkpoint reset solved it)\n+ Interesting enemy AI\n+ Gameplay is innovativ in it's chosen area - 2d platformer\n\n- Can get very annoying\n- No way to judge if your hurting enemies at all / how much life they or you have left\n- Results feel very random - solving areas can be more luck then skill -> this cost me major gameplay enjoyment\n\nAll in all, for me a typical indie game - has fun moments and innovation, but definitvely is also extremely frustrating, and then not in a good way like the souls series.\n\n\n\n","July 26, 2015","true","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The gameplay video captures it pretty well. All this "It's a limbo ripoff" stuff is total nonsense. The only thing it has in common with LIMBO is that they chose not to use lots of unnecessary colors. I like this art style. Theres no reason to color everything, it's much easier to look at. My only complaints are that its a bit short and two of the puzzles are annoying because you have to aim at things before they appear on the screen. This is the exception, not the norm. Almost a perfect game.","January 2","true","8.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Seriously any screenshot could be framed. The characters, the lighting, the animations, it's all so solid. It's a bummer how short it is, I beat it in less than 2 hours, but it makes up for it in it's hectic but skill based combat. Some other reviewers called it chaotic or luck based, but that isn't true. I would compare it to the combat in hotline miami, where it can be very difficult, but it's always up to the player if you live or die.","January 12","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would probably have been willing to pay near full price for this game. The platforming is very technical and the combat is nail-biting. I'd say it has challenging puzzles, but every moment of the game is a challenging puzzle strategically. There are times where you have to have a clever idea to advance, some where you need a clever idea to survive, and many where you just need knife-edge technical platforming skill, good luck, and frame-perfect timing.\n\nThey say this game is short. Maybe it is, but it sure packs a hell of a lot of gameplay into so little space. Here's the concept: you are a tiny hairball who can run at a medium pace, jump an average height or distance, turn around slowly, break a stick over an enemy's head, and throw rocks and logs around. You don't get any special abilities or powerups. It's all just biting your nails and hoping you divined the right strategy and caught a break on the enemy RNG. In short, you will likely strain every muscle in your arm with the tension of combat. A speedrunner may be able to run through the whole game in ten minutes, but it's gonna last you, first time buyer, hours. Hours of real, painful struggle. The kind of struggle that will let you make a learn and wipe the cold sweat from your brow with a smile of accomplishment.\n\nHere's what you also get: A beautiful high-def ambient world of silhouettes quite reminiscent of Limbo; smooth vectorized detailed animations on every character and piece of scenery; believable and accurate physics that never stops delivering surprises; tight, realistic controls that are intuitive and predicable while still leaving you feeling vulnerable; and a gorgeously haunting, melodic soundtrack that perfectly sets the mood for the inherent tension of surviving a world where everything wants to kill you.\n\nIf you enjoyed Limbo, but wished it had more combat, this is a must-buy.","May 29","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
