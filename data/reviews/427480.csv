I love the approach they're taking, when so many other developers are trying to be like Apple and control the user experience.  This chess software is the opposite of all that.  And it has unexpectedly neat features like being able to set .bmp and .jpg files from your computer to be used as the tiles on the chessboard.  I used a grass texture for both colors, and the pieces move in an unmarked field.  Fun touch.\n\nCons: The 3d boards are buggy and the resolution is about as good as a 7-year old game, the VR rooms won't load properly (Windows 10 fully updated, latest drivers, 64 bit, quadcore, 16gbRAM).  And the sets available for the 2d boards leave much to be desired.  But if you're fine with 2d and have no aesthetic requirements, this is dream chess software.","February 22","true","35.4"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","34","40","4","5"

(I used to be quite good.) It is not that, even though it says that it is.","April 30","false","0.6"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

I just got lucky, picked up the software for 18$ instead of the 60$.\n\nWhile there are decent free available alternatives for most of the features Fritz provides, its still an all-in-one solution for any Amateur to Candidate level chess player.\n\nThe biggest mistake people here on Steam make is in thinking that this is a fancy chess game, IT ISN'T.\n\nThink of it as an educational tool which helps you learn, improve, train and play against any engine of your choice.\n\nAlso comes with a 6 month premium subscription for Chessbase which is also pretty cool.\n\nFor my Indian friends, Fritz15 is on an INSANE price just north of 18$ do pick it up if you want to have some money to spare and want to learn and improve in this amazing game.\n\nOnly CONS that I see are:\n\n-The software is still slightly buggy since its pretty recent, and now that I have it for around 18$, 60$ for the rest feels a little overpriced when you can acquire Fritz14 for much cheaper and 90% of it is the same. IF you have good money to spare, go for Fritz15, otherwise go for Fritz14.\n\n-The 3D pieces are pretty buggy and VERY tasking on the CPU.But I can easily live without them and use 2D pieces (which they have a huge collection of).\n\n-There are many free alternatives for 'basic chess stuff' like playing against people/computers, analyzing/watching games, annotating ,maintaining an opening repertoire/game databases like Chess.com ,lichess.org  etc.\n\nGo for it if you have the cash. 10/10","March 5","true","2.1"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
