It's that simple. Except it's not, because the difficultly will increase. And if your like me, you will have a tough time. The game will throw in other modes and enemies into play, along with powerup birds that can help beat a frustrating level.\nI'm sure the devs will come out with some new content in the future, and that is my investment. You will get some good time off of this game.","April 22","true","1.7"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","1"

Well this game is pretty fun to play, has nice OST and pretty cheap, all around good buy:\n\n+Great visuals, colorfull and nicely drawn levels, nice animations\n+Good OST and other sounds\n+Pretty challenging, most of the levels i was swinging layers left and right and up and down hoping for the best (mostly because i'm not very smart) but it was fun as heck, specially when you actually win the level :)\n+Plenty of the levels\n+Super cheap +Steam cards = nearly free game :)\n-No steam achievements, but there is achievements in the game, maybe they will attach them to steam aswell later.\n-No proper settings for screen resolution and sound.","May 3","true","9.7"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","11","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/crymsonhog/recommended/428830/","crymsonhog","Crimson Hog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/crymsonhog/","1096 products in account","Very interesting puzzle game.\nMain goal - to save the dodos from the certain death, but you can't control them - they are running forward, dying from savages, thorns and other dangers of this wild world. Also you cannot use some magical items to solve that puzzles. But there is a interesting way for doing this.\nThe game's screen splitted into a number of squire blocks, usually in 3x3 grid. Each block have some "terrain" piece in it, and the lines of blocks are "circled":  if the dodo will run to the left it will appear from the right side, if the savage will fall down - it will continue his falling from the up.\nPlayer have ability to rotate this lines of blocks vertically or horisontally, changing landscape of the mission. Sounds simple, but some mission are quite challenging. I cleared only first word so far, but it was fun.\n\nSo the game is:\n- fun;\n- cheap;\n- have cards;\n- have active support;\n- have good achievments (not that "win that boring campaing by all the races" from DoW2")\nand worth it full price.","June 1","true","5.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The mechanics is quite different, but equally funny.\nOn the only bad thing is on  my ubuntu 14.04.4 it destabilizes steam (I saved dodos, but eventually I had to "kill -9" steam)","May 1","true","0.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It is casual puzzle game, where you need move tiles to change playfield and help dodos get to exit portal or save dodos from hunters in some levels. Atractive game if you like puzzles. Nice timekiller.","May 16","true","1.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It good graphics/art and a good concept and puzzle plot. But it's just not my style. Don't get me wrong I still say it's a pretty good game. I just can't see myself enjoying this game for hours or playing it when I'm bored. But thats just my opinion","May 21","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
