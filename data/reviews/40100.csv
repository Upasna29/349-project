There are a great many changes and the entire game feels rushed and less smooth than the previous two, here are a few reasons why.\n\nThe complex tech trees: Gone. You now start with one tier of unit and minimal choices. Some people prefer this over higher tier units smashing the lower tiers but its simply a lazy option taken instead of actually balancing the different tiers.\n\nThe choices between different commander upgrades: Gone. Research will give you all the upgrades there is no choice involved.\n\nThe fine balance between extracters and power and the need to control enough deposits: Gone. Pump out those generic one tier generators and you will recieve far more mass from them than deposits. There is nothing to be gained by pushing out to control a majority of the map simply turtle it out behind your shields (we'll get to those in a moment) and stock up on units/arty/nukes\n\nThe careful construction of defences and shields for maximum overlap protection: Gone. Spam those shields as close as possible and you can hold off the world. There are some small differences between the different races shields but they all can still all build as many as they want without even thinking about an efficent base design.\n\nThe unique racial differences and strengths and weaknesses: Gone. First designer "hey guys are we going to make the units and structures have different statistics like the first game and have counter intelligence options for complex game strategy?" Design lead "nah screw that it sounds complicated, make all the shields and other structures have identical stats and get rid of the other stuff". Very dissapointing since the units from the first game were so unique but now there is no difference in choosing one faction from another.\n\nThe detailed textures and environments that made it a great looking game: Gone. Its extremely unusual for a series to have a large gap between a game and its sequal and to not improve the graphical quality, this bucks the trend and goes backwards.\n\nWell organised unit co-ordination, grouping and movement: Gone. Walking into each other, spinning on one spot trying to collect something right beneath themselves and refusing to move are now the norms.\n\nThere are more but to be honest I've got to go purge this game from my memory by playing Forged Alliance so this will have to do.","January 6, 2015","false","14.7"," 161 of 230 people (70%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","70","161","230","12","9"

The first Supreme Commander was perfect, an absolutely brilliant game and so was Total Annihilation before that. But Supreme Commander 2 just doesn't cut it.\n\nThe game feels unfinished. There are only a few units and buildings per faction with no tech tiers or special functions. Graphically it is not as good as the previous game and the rehaul on the factions unit styles is just simply strange... like the cybran giant fire-breathing lizard with robotic limbs.\n\nThe maps are tiny and the lack of units literally means the only strategy available is to hurl a constant wave of bots at the enemy.\n\nThe campaign is also lacking. They've attempted to add more of a back story through a series of overly cheesy and annoying cutscenes and comms dialogue.

It definitely has a more intense feel than other similiar RTS games, such as SupCom 1 and Total Annhilation.  The overal strategy is a little smaller in scale, but this leads to faster battles that are more fun to watch.  It's still far more of a macro game than something like Starcraft, but it's one where you can still watch the units vs being zoomed out the entire time like it's predecesor.  It's campaign is plenty fun and playing on hard can be a good intro to skirmish matches.  In additon to traditional multiplayer matches, co-op vs the ai is very fun and challenging as well.

Supreme Commander 1 was a true successor to my beloved TA, and it still is. I found a new love. A year or 2 later, Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance came out, which in my opinion is the definitive edition. The scale of Supreme Commander 1 is grand. I'm a huge RTS fan and supreme commander 1 has to by my number 1 favorite RTS game of all time, aside from its predecessor Total Annihilation of course. These 2 games have taken away a good portion of my life.\n\nNow on to Supreme Commander 2..... ummmm..... I'm heartbroken. I've forced myself to play it a few times but i honestly just cant take it. Its horrible. SupCom2 does not have the same gameplay as SupCom1. The scale of SupCom 2 is too dumbed down. There is no sense of grand scale in this game. The maps are unsatisfyingly too small. The unit cap is also extremely low. And the unit designs are crap. This game is just sad and ruins the Supreme Commander name\n\nFor those of you who have never played SupCom1, then you might think that this is a good/decent game. I dont blame you.\n\nAs a fan of Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander, please hear me out...\n\nDO NOT BUY THIS GAME! (I mean you can if you want. I'll just pity you).

But compared to the previous to Supreme Commander games this is a major step down. Remember how there were huge tech trees? such as the tier one factory can upgrade to the teir two which unlocked more units, well thats all gone. Instead now you build a research station which slowly gains research points which you use to upgrade your units not unlock new ones. Remember how you could choose a commander to start the game with? well now it is story based so you have to play the commanders in order (UEF, AEON the Cybran). Explosions are amazingly downgraded aswell. Remember the satisfaction of destroying a commander and watching a huge nuclear blast spread and destroy their base? Well now the commander explodes in a small blast and and all the oppents units die at once. Also all of the experimental units are extremely nerfed remember the AEON saucer? now it is smaller and much weaker, send 7 intercepters at it and it's gone. The Cybran spider bot has been turned into a crappy little beetle bot which are so easy to defeat they're in the first mission. All shields are the same size now (small, unless your counting huge UEF shield in the DLC) and instead of them all blocking shots the Aeon and Cybran shields let 15% of shots through! and now all shields look the same aswell. But the most annoying thing, the most annoying thing of them all is that everything you build counts as a unit. No more unlimited turrent defences, no unlimited shield protection and no more complex base defences.

My favorite one to play *is* SC 2 because the experimental units dont take an age to build like in SC 1 and they are not godlike as they are in SC 1 (they can be beaten with enough normal units). There has been a lot of attention tot balanced yet diverse units within the factions. There are innovative units like the BFG Big Friendly Gun to convert enemy units to friendly and the grinder magnet thats very effective. Units dont get locked up bumping into each other when moving in big groups and scenery is awesome.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/recommended/40100/","midnightwolfie","MidnightWolfie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/","597 products in account","A bit about the game and developers.\nSupreme Commander 2 is a great robotic strategy game developed by Gas Powered Games and published by Square Enix.Gas Powered Games are also developers of Demigod, original Supreme Commander and so on and on, while Square Enix is a publisher of many published games like Tomb Raider, Hitman, Sleeping Dogs and others.\n\nAbout Gameplay.\nSupreme Commander 2 is a strategy game with three different factions. Each faction has its own units. Each Faction has its own bonuses. UEF have strongest unites, most expensive units and units with most HP. Cybran Nation are the weakest but the least expensive. They take the least amount of time to construct and are always largest in numbers. Aeon Illuminate are the most balanced units. Their HP and attack strength fits perfectly with the price of the unit and the construction time. There's one more faction in this game, but since it's unplayable I don't think they are too important.\n\nThe game has both single player and multiplayer mode. In single player your objective is, of course, to save the world. The story is pretty good but nothing too special. The awesome thing about this game is the multiplayer. Since the game is about 2-3 years old the servers are very empty. And those that have players are usually professionals and games with them lasts about five to ten minutes. There's tones of strategies you can do to win this game. I played a lot of skirmish games to learn a lot about this game.\n\nTo be able to play this game correctly you need to  learn fast. Because even AI is so smart that it can win against you on normal difficulty. It will attack you from all possible directions: water, air and land. It will attack in small waves while slowly building a huge wave of army. The AI is amazing.\n\nIt has three different resources. Mass, Energy and Research. You can set up research facilities and energy builders where ever you want, but you can only place Mass on a designed area. Players can fight against each other to be able to own the Mass builders that they need.\n\nYou need Mass and Energy to be able to build new units and structures, while you need research points to be able to research for new units, more HP or new building that will help you with who knows what. You need to make sure to always have enough of each, but you also need to make sure that you're able to make a big amount of units since this game is all about large scale wars.\n\nAs mentioned before, this game is all about large scale wars.  In my opinion best tactic is to play with two friends. One person focuses on land units, second on water and third on air. That way you can have biggest army numbers due to smallest cost of units. There are two main game types, annihilation and score points. In annihilation your objective is to kill enemy commanders while in score points your objective is to gather as main points as you can by taking over couple of big towers.\n\nGraphic and Audio\nGraphic is great! Lasers and rockets everywhere, blown up robots, massive explosions. It's very well made. Details on the units are also extremely nice! Songs are very quiet and calming, but for the most of the time you're so focused on the action and all the lasers that you barely even hear it.\n\nPros, cons and final grade.\nPros:\n- Wonderful graphic.\n- Amazingly fun skirmish.\n- Huge scale battles.\n- Very fun if you have a friend or two to play against the AI.\n\nCons:\n- No players so there are barely any multiplayer games.\n\nOverall grade: 7/10\n\nExtra info: If you're big mech fan as I am, and if you love strategy games, this game is for you. It doesn't involve much thinking, but it's extremely fun to play. Though, don't count on Gundam units to be in this game. Sadly there are no units looking like Gundam ones, hehe.\n\n\nThank you for reading my reviews!

It is a very dumbed down version which replaces many of the original’s mechanics with research grinding rather then building up bases and getting more advanced units. Basic units are just that, basic they are very boring and very small versus the levels and other units, while you can upgrade them with various research items to make them more effective it does a very poor job at replacing the 3+1 unit tier levels from the previous games. With this game now more then ever you rely heavily on the experimental units rather then building up a force of mixed units of various tiers with maybe one or two X units in the mix.\n\nThe main campaign does a good enough job at some kind of a story and MOST of the missions are gradual in their difficulty and challenge. However that difficulty spikes abnormally high when you reach the final 4 to 6 missions of the Cybran and you will fail multiple times before you figure out what the developers wanted you to do.\n\nThe skirmish AI and the AI in general tends to cheat and does so pretty obviously, getting clear stat, research speed, mass and energy boasts right off the bat, even on normal difficulty, which is a shame because I always enjoyed the TA/SC skirmish games.\n\nI had shied away from buying this game when it came out after hearing reviews that it was a very basic and stripped version designed for mostly console play so I avoided it until 2013’s Christmas sale. I am glad I did because as much as I really wanted enjoy this game and get just as much play out of it as I did with Sup Com/FA and Total Annihilation it would seem that that is not the case. This will be one of the few games that I have purchased that will not last long on my hard drive, possibly to make room for something more worth while.\n\nIf you really want to continue to the story of Sup Com and FA, then by all means buy it when it’s on sale again, but do NOT buy this if you were a fan of TA or SC/FA. This honestly makes me worry about what Planetary Annihilation will be like which I hope will not be the case.","September 2, 2014","false","39.0"," 68 of 110 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","68","110","2","0"

It does lack the finesse of Supremme Commander 1 and Forged Allaince which I think are the bees knees...\n\nWhats more, I dont think that the people who developed it balanced the units particularly well, specifically the experimentals, I have no idewa why anyone would prefer to use a 'chicken egg' aeon unit as oppose to an Anomium (however u spell the AA exp)or UC  because it is rubbish, whats more the megalith aint that great either.  And then, why give the Aeon the AA exp (which can be taken down by 10-15  gunships) and give cybran the soul ripper, which is quite powerful (air unit) and give the UEF the terror exp thingy and no aa unit, I just think, as I read about Watch dogs earlier, that this dev crew have cut and pasted and not thought too much about what they were doing... (supcom 1 avoided this by making 3 tech levels which when paired with sheilds all races ahd would give each exp a very good run for it's money in defence, let alone the asfs, to the regular t1 intcepeteors)... regardless, I am not quite convinced that they did a great job of this, I admit perhaps i should throw each of them up against each other in a few skirmishes.\n\nEconomy wise, yes it's like any other standard industry modelled strategy game other than the original which really doesn't work well when making experiementals, i.e.unless you are have money coming out of all orifaces,  your smaller factories will keep hoarding the resources whilst the exp factories etc will sit there doing nothing.  Yes... maybe there is some skill and attetnion to be paid to this problem, but this just makes a simple game into one of those tedious complex games that the Dev's clearly wanted to avoid, when going back to the drawing board from Supcom 1 and they way supcom 1 handled it was far more elegeant!\n\nNow , the research.  Well it has been done before, and it doesn't feel right, for a start, it kills the pleasure of killing and killing and getting better - veterency.  making your commander and exps mortal and very lacking even when some noob throws rubbish units at u time after time (though the mass income normally makes that worth it).  And yes, creating more research centre makes it easier...  But, after all that, research centres are rendered useless after all research is complete,  making a practical investment in those centres very short sighted strategy wise. End point is , research in the long run feels pointless.\n\nI suppose the research tree does make it easier for noobs who can look over their options, although restrictive trees dont necessarily do this, but the idea of upgrading lots of things on units is fun! even the ACU upgrades have been done away with in favour of this tree, so there is no choice, it's the capitalist idea, get resources and buy everything, boring! :(\n\nAlso , as this is a Square Enix game, just as you would find the same smell about a 2K game or a UBIsoft game, so you do so with the airy fairy Square ENIX... shame, so many games are gutted and strung up by these awful mass companies, they should just let the real professionals get on with it!\n\nTRololol, this is worth playing on a weekend off, but it doesn't have anywhere near the life of a good  game would and defintely no where near it's predicessor!","March 14, 2015","true","25.9"," 27 of 38 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","27","38","2","2"

I have played several skirmish games, co-op and 6 missions of the main campaign. You have Land, Naval and Air units to build and research upgrades for. There are three major factions to choose from that are diverse but balanced in most aspects. You need to build up fairly quick and get mixed units to be effective. You fight in a Giant Mech that once destroyed loses you the game. The units are varied enough and the game is enjoyable in quick bursts.\nIt seems to me to be the natural follow up to Total Annihilation, an old RTS game that received a lot of praise back in my day.  It is the first decent RTS I have played since Starcraft 2.\nDon't get me wrong with the comparison at the start though, Planetary Annihilation is also fun but when you are fighting across planets and using orbital platforms it gets very confusing, very fast.

I played this with my brother all the time, it was really fun for the both of us. All three factions, Illuminate, Cybran and Uef have its own unique unit and factory designs, the three factions have different ideas with factories or units. Like how the Illuminate has a Darkenoid an experimental air ship completely different to the other two factions. How Uef has a big connection with your commander like how enemies can't locate you on their radar, Cybran and Illuminate doesn't have that sort of access. Or how the Cybran has naval units that grow legs out and crawls its way onto land.\n\nI love playing as Illuminate, its not because of its interesting designs or unique abilities of some what. I just enjoy my units being capable of walking in and out of water instead of having to waste another whole energy and mass on a naval factory. And if I needed to retreat there is always an island to head to just to build my base there instead if my main territory gets destroyed and taken over.\n\nMy brother plays as the Cybran or Uef, those are pretty good factors too. I mean if you had the DLC as a Cybran you'd be able to create yourself the Monkey Lord from which some of my old friends confirm as the most powerful experimental unit in the game. And how the Uef has the King Kriptor which I think seems to be the most powerful experimental out of the Uef.\n\nWhen me and my brother played together I'd take control of the air while he takes control of the land, because land units is his thing and air units is my thing so we just put those two elements together to make a perfect team, thats what makes the game fun for me, we work our own ways and do whats best to try take down our opponents. We build massive bases together like a high security prison which is also quite fun because its hard for our enemies to launch nukes until they destroy our overpowered defense system.\n\nI'm addicted to this game, I'm always in the process of building up my defenses first, not that I'm useless but that without defenses how are you gonna protect your commander?

It does however prevent players from getting into the building hole of SupCom, with the negative in that some builders can stall permanently if resources are stolen before they can allocate for a build item.\n\nWith the mods available for this, I can heartily recommend it as the community is still going this many years after the game was released.

But i absolutely love it. Actually i like it better then Forged Alliance. While Forged Alliance did have some nice bonuses as to putting more then one engineer on a building process and some other things, This game is abit better and more organized in my opinion. In Forged Alliance, to build an Experimental you had to use 1-10 engineers to build it on a random plot of land. In SC2, you can make them from factories.\n\nI for one like that instead of random plots of land. Other things i am sad to see go were the Support Armored Command Units. They were very useful but i wont that ruin my gameplay fun!\n\nThe research is a nice add on, limits and makes things more complicated and more advanced. Not to mention very very challenging. Forged alliance was easy once a good base was set up, in SC2, it keeps you active and on alert for a surprise attack.\n\nAnother interesting challenge is defending against the Nukes! First time i played it, i was torn apart! But i eventually found a way to defend against 5-6 nukes every 3-5 mins. People also mention units move slow...Actually, they don't. They are 100% the same as Forged Alliance.\n\nPros:\n- Good System of Units\n- New Land, Air and Naval Units\n- New Structures\n- New way to acquire Mass and Energy\n- Challenging\n- A cool research system that provides complexity\n- Keeps you on alert and not underestimating the AI\n- Interesting Campaign and Storyline\n- Good Multiplayer System\n- New and Cool Maps to play on\n- Better Graphics\n- Better Quality\n- Less Laggy then Forged Alliance when building huge hoards of units\n\nCons:\n- Some classic Units from Old games were removed (Not that it is important!)\n- Only one engineer per building instead of many that could build one building in Forged Alliance\n- No SACUs\n- Some Useless Units, but it doesn't affect the gameplay at all\n- A little to frequent in Nuke Launching by AI and the # of Nukes is abit to high per strike. (Can be defended if done correctly)\n\nSo in conclusion, I would recommend the game to all my friends and surely say, it would be a great purchase and you will have tons of fun and will keep you active for a good time !","January 12","true","64.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","10","15","0","0"

It's kind of like starcraft with a strategic view, which is actually pretty cool.  But it is not what I would expect to follow a game like Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance.  Many of the models and names of the units in the game are similar to the previous game, but the scale of SupCom 1 is completely lost and having an upgrade system is against the heart of how Supreme Commander 1 was interesting.  It makes me thing that they were trying to compete with the player base of starcraft instead of creating an actual second game in the line of Total Annihilation and Supreme Commander (Supreme Commander was touted by the devs as the 'spiritual successor' of Total Annihilation, and I consider the first one successful in that regard, but the second, not so much).","October 6, 2014","false","10.6"," 15 of 25 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","15","25","0","0"

Anyway the main review i have played this game for a good 2 hours now (on pc) and its way better than the dimmed down console version the unit cap is 500 instead of 200 you can change the gamespeed there is more AI options and the dlc is amazing (i dont own the dlc but its better than the console versions free one with just maps)as you get more units maps and more. the story however isnt intressting in my opinion i just skipped to skirmish and online. speaking of skirmish it is great fun you set the AI map and options and begin a full blown war on your computer screen AMAZING. Lastly i will say this online is great you dont need anything stupid like a surver or passkey you just set up a game invite a friend and done. overall this is a good game and while the story isnt good and some of the things are waterd down from the last game i think rts fans should give this a go.","November 29, 2015","true","9.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

But i absolutely love it. Actually i like it better then Forged Alliance. While Forged Alliance did have some nice bonuses as to putting more then one engineer on a building process and some other things, This game is abit better and more organized in my opinion. In Forged Alliance, to build an Experimental you had to use 1-10 engineers to build it on a random plot of land. In SC2, you can make them from factories.\n\nI for one like that instead of random plots of land. Other things i am sad to see go were the Support Armored Command Units. They were very useful but i wont that ruin my gameplay fun!\n\nThe research is a nice add on, limits and makes things more complicated and more advanced. Not to mention very very challenging. Forged alliance was easy once a good base was set up, in SC2, it keeps you active and on alert for a surprise attack.\n\nAnother interesting challenge is defending against the Nukes! First time i played it, i was torn apart! But i eventually found a way to defend against 5-6 nukes every 3-5 mins. People also mention units move slow...Actually, they don't. They are 100% the same as Forged Alliance.\n\nPros:\n- Good System of Units\n- New Land, Air and Naval Units\n- New Structures\n- New way to acquire Mass and Energy\n- Challenging\n- A cool research system that provides complexity\n- Keeps you on alert and not underestimating the AI\n- Interesting Campaign and Storyline\n- Good Multiplayer System\n- New and Cool Maps to play on\n- Better Graphics\n- Better Quality\n- Less Laggy then Forged Alliance when building huge hoards of units\n\nCons:\n- Some classic Units from Old games were removed (Not that it is important!)\n- Only one engineer per building instead of many that could build one building in Forged Alliance\n- No SACUs\n- Some Useless Units, but it doesn't affect the gameplay at all\n- A little to frequent in Nuke Launching by AI and the # of Nukes is abit to high per strike. (Can be defended if done correctly)\n\nSo in conclusion, I would recommend the game to all my friends and surely say, it would be a great purchase and you will have tons of fun and will keep you active for a good time !","May 14","true","66.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sank73/recommended/40100/","Sank73","Monsieur Hand","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sank73/","295 products in account","In short - a more casual version of SupCom 1. Easier to play, but there's much less to enjoy. Good for casual occasional games with friends. Ultimately, it fails as a Supreme Commander's successor, but stands well as a standalone game.\n\nAlthough Supreme Commander 1 was meant to be /the/ strategy game, with large maps and huge unit caps, where build orders gave place to thought-out tactics, it ultimately ended up being a base-building simulator, as people grew to refer to it. Supreme Commander 2 trades the large scales for a tighter gameplay, shifting focus from the base to the units.\n\nThe units are fewer in variety, each having a distinct role. There is much less fiddling with assembling a perfect mix of the hundreds of different bots, tanks, and airplanes. Choosing your tactics is now more clearly resembling rock-paper-scissors, which is both good and bad, depending on the player.\nAlso, there are only either big badass mother♥♥♥♥ing guns, or cannon fodder. You don't build a tactical missile launcher to fend off your enemies. It's either a small artillery installation, or a nuke. Same with units vs. experimentals.\nBut wait, speaking of experimental units, it's not as black and white. As before, they are pretty much useless alone when facing a critical mass of smaller units. Perhaps even more so than in SupCom 1, you will want to provide escorts to your big guys. Here, they are easier to build and to destroy, but having one early enough can still mean a victory.\n\nThere is a new resource - Research - gained through battle and boosted by research stations. Tech tiers gave way to global upgrades (purchased with research points) that are applied to all units, buildings, or else - existing and future. This serves to speed up the game, though it takes away from the complexity. Whereas in SupCom 1 destroying an upgraded outpost with tech 3 factories was a big hit, here it doesn't take much to rebuild it. Experiments units are also unlocked with research.\nInstead of choosing between spending resources on improving your economy/units and building more units, you just do both simultaneously, while spending any excessive mass/energy you have on research stations.\nSpeaking of resources, here you don't get to build mass/energy storages - they are unlimited. Instead of draining your money during construction, the cost is deduced at the beginning of the process. Finally, there are no mass fabricators, and I have never seen someone have a problem with energy, for the reactors are very cheap and effective.\n\nThere is not much to say of the base. Just as unites, the buildings are also fewer. At the beginning of the game, you are presented with a choice of 8 "normal" structures and one "advanced" - the radar. As you research the upgrades for the structures, you unlock things like artillery, nukes, and others.\nEngineers now cannot assist each other when building structures (they can, however, assist factories).\nEverything is built much faster in comparison to SupCom 1 (where 30-minute build times weren't extraordinary, though improved in FA) - you won't find an experimental who takes much more than 3 minutes to build.\n\nI haven't completed the story, but from what I played it wasn't incredibly interesting. Perhaps as a tool for honing your skills, it would do.\n\nThe visual style of the game is nice - it is also simplified, as if to underline the idea the developers had in mind. Similar to Planetary Annihilation - almost a bit cartoonish. Although now outdated and no eye candy at all, it is still pleasant to look at while playing.\n\nI would recommend this game to people who want to play a SupCom-esque game with friends, but don't want to take the days to teach them how to play it. It's simple, bright, fun, and fast. There is not much depth to it, but the gameplay is satisfying and victories sweet.\nPersonally, I couldn't stand to play it for more than a few hours a month, as I kept switching to Supreme Commander 1. And if you want a fun match with friends, I would recommend Starcraft 2 over this.","March 2, 2015","true","39.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Poor AI, when you can get experimentals .. spam the crap out of them, missions that are only difficult (if at all) for the first 10-ish minutes, etc. However the game plays quite nicelly, it has cheating AI's in skirmish/MP and because of the 'flatness' you do not have to reserve 2+ hours to take down a cheating AI in skirmish or do a single campaign mission. Compared to the original, with 5 (or 6?) mission, it actually has 15 though. That does offer some more variaty in the missions but the overall time you spend on the campaign wont be much longer than you spend doing the campaign in the original.","July 17, 2015","true","133.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Diese Einstellung haben die entwickler gelöst, in dem sie ein Forschungssystem eingebaut haben, wo man sich mit Forschungspunkten die Gebäude frei kaufen kann. Aber wer mehr auf Riesenschlachten steht und auch mal so eine halbe Stunde warten kann um ein Gebäude zu bauen, dem würde ich die älteren Teile empfehlen.","April 10, 2012","true","265.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

Whenever im bored or stressed out I always play SupCom2. I have over 500 hours in the game and going for the magic number 1000\n\nThe gameplay is a lot of fun and it requries careful observation of what your doing but also be able to adapt to your opponents strategy. Unlike other strategy games SupCom2 goes fast. I mean FAST you dont pay attention and you will see yourself having 10000 mass and weak units. A good knowledge of the tech tree and game mechanics is a must.\n\nSingle player is good for begineers to get their hand on all factions and learn basic mechanics of the game. but the story is a little dry. You'll find you will be spending most of your time online or playing skirmish.\n\nMultiplayer is troubling and rewarding. Very few games that you play in Multiplayer will actually be fair games and games are usually less that 30 min. BUT stalemates can last HOURS my longest was 3 hours and the game was so tense. Theres something thrilling about making giant robots shooting each other. The units attack from the land sea and sky. Winning the game isnt that hard either just build the most units as quickly as you can. The hard part is HOW you build those units. Will you build air to counter air? Or anti air units and Bomb Bouncers? Will you push a land force away with magnets or tele to their base.\n\nThis game desperatlely needs a community and everyday the player count gets less and less everyday I see the same people online too extremely often when only there are 4 lobbies. But playing the game thrilling and rewarding and was the game that got me into PC gaming.

When i had only the disc copy, It is a beautiful game to play with friends. Not like SuPCoM FA but this game can still hold well with a few mods. But thats for someone who reads these Reviews to find out. But none the less the time i have played it was great ran smooth even on older Desktops/Labtops. With the unit cap set Slightly smaller of course. But none the less. The Uber units are fun to toy with and as some have stated can be brought down with upgraded basic unity or advanced units, Units dont take a as long as build in SuPCoM FA they dont bunch up and the cloaking unit is a nice touch for ruseing your friend or a rando (Random player) Air and Naval combat is a blast watching the cannons fire pulse lasers and more fly through the air and make contact with the enemy.

The graphics and gameplay are solid, and although the experimentals are now 'nerfed' by quite a large margin, they still bring a great sense of power to the battlefield. The research system has been improved and overhauled, adding another level of resource gathering, and leading to more diverse factions than in the previous game. Admitedly, the single player campaign is not the best, and while I enjoyed it, you may see it to be cliche and guessable.\n\nBut who plays Supreme Commander for the single player?! The skirmish mode and the online are the heart of the game.\nIf this game is on sale, buy it.\n\nNote: The multiplayer is quite barren, so get the original Supreme Commander and the dlc as well.

(I believe you should have ATLEAST 24 hours on a game to give even a mediocre review) Its a easy real time strategy to get into, plays similar to SC2 or Command & Conquer basically like any other strategy game. I played the version on the xbox for some time and i liked it then so bought it for pc when was on sale but didnt get too much into it. Personally i would give it maybe a 6.5/10 not too hot but was fun for the few hours i have on it. I would personally grab SC2 or C&C over this but hey if you have a few extra bucks to spend willy nilly then here you go, a quick strategy game for you to mess around on.

The Commander is your main unit (aka YOU), and with it you can create factories that will produce troops to fight for you.There is also a reserch tree. Each branch (Land, Air, Naval, Commander) helps it with things like shield generators on your units, an escape pod for your commander, or even new units, like the Terror 2000 gunship.

It's like they took supreme commander and watered it down past red alert 2 levels to create the most cookie cutter "game" ever. Gone are the powerfull experimentals, replaced with poor imitations that your ACU can easily defeat alone without any danger. A small handfull of the first tier units can take these out. Gone are the large maps and unit selection. Replaced with tiny zones and only one or two units per element (air, land, sea). You can upgrade them sure, but it still takes away from having to actually do anything strategical whatsoever, in favor of simply unit spamming. The visualls or good; at least for the environment. The unit graphics have been REDUCED substancially. If i had to give this game a score it would be 10%.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/40100/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","975 products in account","Quick Summary: Real Time Strategy game with huge maps and tons of units in play. If you liked StarCraft or Command & Conquer, you should enjoy Supreme Commander 2.\n\nThe game has 3 separate single player campaigns all taking place approximately the same time regarding an ancient piece of technology that has been discovered. You play a UEF commander (Human), an Illuminate commander (advanced alien race), and a Cybran commander (cybernetic humans) in the intersecting campaigns, all fighting against factions of the other races, as well as the mysterious Cybran Gauge, who seems to know a lot more about the Shiva Prime technology than anyone else.\n\nWhile the game has similar mechanics to most other Real Time Strategy games, what sets the Supreme Commander series apart is the massive scale of the levels and combat. You have a 300 unit cap and you can really fill the map with units. This is quite a feat because the maps are huge compared to other games like StarCraft or WarCraft. In fact, the maps are so large that you constantly need to zoom out and view the world from a strategic view, otherwise there’s no way you can rely on your minimap to keep an eye on the enemy. Additionally, the research/tech upgrading system is closer to Command & Conquer Generals, where instead of doing your tech upgrades in specific buildings, you access your tech trees in a meta console after you’ve accumulated enough research points. The research points are gained over time from building research buildings or killing enemy units. There are a ton of research options, so you’re unlikely to unlock everything in any given match unless you’re really, really trying.\n\nPros:\n+Decent, long single player campaigns to get your money’s worth out of the game. Just playing single player will probably take about 12 hours to finish. The multiplayer can occupy even more of your time. +I mentioned the extensive tech tree that you can research, and these options can unlock a number of “experimentals” which are basically huge units that can march slowly across the battlefield kicking ♥♥♥. Each race has their own experimentals to use, some better than others.\n\nCons:\n-The graphics aren’t anything special. Dawn of War 2, which came out earlier has more convincing gameplay visuals, though the cinematic cutscenes for both these games aren’t all that impressive.\n-The game is really slow in single player. I don’t mean that the game runs slow on my computer, I mean the game is set to be slow paced and you can’t increase game speed (you can adjust speed in multiplayer). This is especially annoying because of how huge the maps are. If you already know you have enough units to win, you’ll probably want to speed up the game as you’re marching towards the enemy with your huge army.\n\n\nOverall the game is worth a playthrough for the single player campaign, but there are still people playing the multiplayer that you can match with.\n","May 9","true","32.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On its own merits, this is an okay game that is compotently executed, but if you're a fan of RTS games in general or the original Supreme Commander in particular, you'll hate this smaller, duller, dumbed-down rushfest of a sequel. A special thumbs down goes to the campaign story, which is short, boring and filled with incompetent, absurd characters spouting cringe-worthy dialogue.","July 1, 2014","false","18.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It was about building dozens of factories, and streaming out enough deathbots to dominate enough of the map to produce enough mass to afford the next tier up. Then: stream out more.\n\nOn a 25 square kilometer map, that’s just a very satisfying, physically simulated version of a normal RTS. On a 6,561 square kilometer map, it’s an apocalypse. Your mind goes into overdrive trying to manage eighteen separate assault groups, balance and defend dozens of income sources while ramping up production to meet your snowballing wealth.\n\nBut throughout it all, the game takes care of the boring stuff for you: units defend themselves intelligently while moving, they organise themselves in optimal formations and stay in them come hell or high water.","April 4, 2011","true","21.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"

First off SC2 was a trade off in scale to be able to run on the xbox 360 (which is actually a good game if your looking for a good strategy for your console).  But it still has more scale than many other popular RTS games.  The game is far less unit managament and less unit upgrade focused.  You basically pick your attack path at the beginning and off you go, changing from your direction in the game is a bit hard to pull off but with a good teammate it can be done.  The game has great graphics, but unfortunetly it can't take advantage of our awesome new multi-core CPU's we have today, infact it really only uses 1 core and about 20% of a 2nd if you have it, for example the game ran as fast on my 4.2ghz pentium 4 extreme edition as it did on my Q6600 when I got the game years ago.  Gas Powered games is gone now, but just before they were bought up they released a new AI patch which really helped with a lot of the stupidy the AI had, the AI was already challenging but i quickly found a lot of tactics no longer worked against certain levels of enemies.  Faction balance is terrible in the standard game, imo of course, but once you add the DLC the game gets a whole new persective, every faction can now push there attacks in all 4 major ways (naval, air, land, artillery) except Aion who have no artillery.  At the current price point you would be a fool to not pick up the game and the DLC they are completly worth it.  Single player I still need to finish, I have always been terrible about finishing single player in RTS games though :)  If your playing a large multiplayer match or want to get into multiplayer make sure to get some friends going(you use steam to invite into games), and make sure who ever has the most powerful system hosts the game.","February 27, 2014","true","287.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Supreme commander involves complex thinking and complex options to over defeat your enemies. You need to choose wisely with your research and you mass production in the maps format.

To quote a fellow reviewer - "This is a piece of fecal matter game."\n\nA lot of the negative reviews focus on the fact that this game is "dumbed down" from SupCom 1 and FA, and I completely agree but that doesn't mean that it is intrinsically worse. Don't get me wrong, the campaign is pretty slow and not that fun but the multiplayer is what most players are interested in anyway right? (at least with friends) and that is where this game comes into its own.\n\nWhere other SupCom games offer deep base building and long, tactical skirmishes, 2 features more fastpaced and straightforward gameplay, matches can take anywhere between 20 to 60 minutes and you can get together 100 units within 15 mins easily, perfect for people like me wanting a quick burst of fairly strategic, flashy RTS. Its pretty easy to pick up and play too so if you are looking for an friendly RST that won't take hours to get somewhere with, you can't go wrong here.

Moving on, I played the normal humans or whatever, like UDF or something. You play as a Dominic guy that commands a big bot and it gets attacked by some things and you must defend yourself, until the biggest cliché appears (SPOILERS, move until I give a blank space between paragraphs): you go rogue! Wow, didn't see that coming -.- "bazinga!". The characters are barely fleshed out and you dont give a crap about them! At all!\n\n(Readable  now) So after that I played the skirmish and MP. Skirmish is cool and fun for like 4 hours then it gets boring as hell! Enemy AI harder than easy tends to rush you (considered a noob tactic in this game) which will totally catch you off guard the first time and completely screw you. And you should get used to it, thus the devs included unit/move restrictions! Like, no air units, no experimentals, no rushing, etc.\nEVEN THEY know their game is unbalanced!\n\nAlso, wanna know my super-secret win-everything? get 1000 mass, 2000 energy, build nuke silo and a nuke and win!\n\nI can't say much more but that the effects and graphics are pretty good except the awful world and unit geometry, like there is no Anisotropy or AA.\n\nOverall, it sucks, get on a 75% off deal.","September 21, 2013","false","12.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainsnowflake/recommended/40100/","captainsnowflake","Doodlebob","http://steamcommunity.com/id/captainsnowflake/","113 products in account","TL;DR: I'll put the tldr segment first because of the way they format the text:\nSupreme Commander 2 is a basic RTS that did not hold on to what it had in the first two games of the franchise. If you have not played the first games and are just looking for a nice looking RTS, then this is your game.\n\n\nI have played Supreme Commander since the original was released back in 2007, I loved that game and it brought many new features to the RTS scene that have now become pretty much standard (ex: “strategic zoom”). After the pretty much utter failure of Forged Alliance, I was pretty surprised to see a sequel to a game whose first installment was pretty good, but had lost grasp on its fans by making a spin off and releasing it as a full game at full price when it really should have been an expansion or DLC. The First two games: Supreme Commander and Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, were both produced by THQ, developed by Gas Powered Games and to quote from the boxes “An Arts From [designed by] Christ Taylor”. These games had many mechanics that separated from other RTSs that were out that the time. The games had a focus on large unit management (I’m talking 1000+ units, none of that 200 max unit stuff you see in other games) to dominate the battlefield, players also had to use the terrain to their advantage to flank their enemies.\n\nThe resource management system that was in place in the first titles was also very different from other games at the time. Instead of having a set amount of resource in your position and you’re only able to build units with that set amount (if that makes any sense), SC and SCFA both had a resource rate system. This system would allow you to build as many units as you wanted, just production would slow down if you did not have a high enough rates of resources coming in, creating some pretty interesting situations when you realize that one of you Mass Extractors had been removed and you wonder why you’re not building as fast.\n\nUnits in the first two games were handled by a tier system. When you could afford to spend some time and had some extra resource coming in you could choose to upgrade up to two higher (because you start on tier one) tiers unlocking new units and engineers to build. When you obtain enough tier three engineers (for sake of practicality) you could build some pretty power game ender units called Experimental Units. These beasts included things such as a mobile factory that could build almost anything almost instantly and was pretty much indestructible, to gigantic humanoid robots that would shoot laser beams from their eyes. You could also build a unit called a Support Command Units, which were smaller less functional versions of the main Armored Command Units (which is what you play as), pretty much they make great suicidal units.\n\nNow enough about the first to games in the franchise, let’s talk about Supreme Commander 2 (the third game of the series). You may be wondering why I spent all that time talking about the first games in the series; well it’s because they changed all that (well most of it). Publication of Supreme Commander 2 was transferred over to Square Enix, but was still developed by Gas Powered Games. The seconded game had more of a focus on small group combat rather than large scale unit combat like in the first game. The map design was also drastically different with even more of a requirement on terrain use. This wasn’t really a bad thing; the new maps were interesting and helped to balance the support between each kind of unit (land, air, sea). However one of the biggest flaws with in the game was with the units. They scrapped the tier system that was present in the first game for tech tree system. Gone are the days were you could build cheap factories that would pump out meat shields and cheap scouts. With this new tree system the placed in a resource, research points, along with the original two, Mass, and Energy. These points could be farmed or gained just from passing time, and then spent in the tree. Now some of these upgrades are pretty interesting, you can detach the control module of the AUC to make a quick escape and then make a bad-♥♥♥ comeback; but still the heavy focus on the system felt to simplify what made the first games unique and challenging; now all your factories have access two those high power units, and you no longer have to micromanage them. But by far the worst change that they made was to the resource system. They went from an “interest” based income system as I described before, to the standard “bank” system that is present in other RTSs such as Star Craft. This hurt the game, slowing the pacing down from all out action which made the first game amazing fun, to a waiting game to see who can farm the most and get Experimental Units first.\n\nIn the end Supreme Commander 2 is a decent strategy game, but that’s all it is. GPG did not stick to what made the first two games so different, high pacing action with ridiculous unit counts and lots of explosions. The maps are interesting enough to keep games exciting for the first few rounds, and the visuals are fantastic even for a three year old game. However I still can’t help but feel hurt that this cult favorite that really was the benchmark for RTSs (both visually and mechanically) at the time it was released has been watered down to please a wider demographic. Also I feel that I should note that it was released a few weeks before Star Craft 2 so that didn’t help with sales. In all I would recommend the first two games over this one: Supreme Commander, and Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, if you want a unique RTS experience and don’t already own them. If you want a beautiful RTS with unique units but really basic mechanics then go right ahead and pick up Supreme Commander 2.","December 1, 2013","false","36.2"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","1"

Its just dissappointing, compared to the previous SupCom games. My biggest issue, is how useless shields are. They cover next to nothing, in SupCom:FA, you could cover your entire base with 3 or 4 heavy shield generators. Now, in a DLC, you can get an experimental shield generator, but that's the DLC, and Im not talking about the DLC, Im talking about the game. Another issue I have with this, is the border markers, PDs range, shields range, etc. Its a thick ring, that doesnt give you a very precise-feeling measurement. I much prefer Supreme Commander's thin ring, it feels so much better. Also, they obliterated some of my favorite experimentals, namely the FatBoy. That thing was a beast, heavy shield gen, long range cannons, unit production capabilities. Now its just a big bloody tank. I love this game. But I would advise against buying it, go and buy the fist Supreme Commander, or Forged Alliance.","February 7, 2014","false","272.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

BUBBLEDOW??? what the ♥♥♥♥ guys seriously? it would have sold many more copies were it not so childish. people need to realize, yes, a childish game will make kids beg their parents for it, but kids will be the only people going crazy about it, even though they have no idea how to play it. what normal 10 year old is going to know how to play it? its like they aimed for ten year olds when they made the game.\n\ni also hate how the ability to walk amphibious units through large bodies of water was taken away. i hate how if the water is deep, its extremely deep, and it always drops suddenly. the megalith 2 looks ♥♥♥♥ing epic, but its abilities are ♥♥♥♥. i thought daaamn this things gonna be epic walking underwater...and it even LOOKS like a crab...it looked like the perfect amphibious unit. yet it cant even touch the water.\n\nthe two walking giants are great. in terms of graphics that is. the universal colossus looks totally ♥♥♥♥ing epic in comparison to the galactic, but it dies so easily. the thing i hate the most about the two is how the king kriptor fires these MASSIVE shells which are at least twice the size of any normal unit, yet a group of ten completely "naked"(for lack of a better word) rockhead tanks can kick its ♥♥♥. the screenshot of the king kriptor surrounded by units, they must have taken the screenshot just before it died, or rather, just as it was dropped into battle.\n\nthere are several other things that i can complain about but there are a few good things about it, you get what you pay for, the dlc makes it playable at all, and as a friend of mine who has already posted here, there is a mod out called revamp. its in its alpha stages right now, the only reason i bought supcom 2 was for the revamp mod. when the big release comes out(a while) it will be just as big if not bigger than all these games coming out now. when i reccomend this game, im reccomending the mod with the game, not the game by itself.\n","January 21, 2014","true","184.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

For one, I definatly like the strategic view where you can organize units into groups. Supreme Commander 2 has a much better campaign and some well-designed skirmish maps. Another key improvement is the differences in the factions. In Supreme Commander the factions were basically the same and the only difference was the appearence of the units. Supreme Commander 2 has signifigantly incresed the depth and strategy of the game.\n\nThere are a few downsides though. To start there's the desreased unit cap. In the orignal Supreme Commander you could have 1000 units on the field at once, whereas now you can only have 500. Also, some of the units have lost a lot of their original power. Take the fatboy for example, in supreme commander it was an amphibious mobile factory with a shield and immense firepower.

I strongly feel that the developers/publisher sold out for consoles with this sequel. This was the last game I ever preordered because I trusted the developers to keep true to the model after SupCom (a great successor to Total Annihilation). Unfortunately, they removed all of the depth of the original with this and basically made another fast-pased starcraft-like clone rather than keeping to the original idea of a true STRATEGY game in terms of scale.\n\nVery disappointed. If you liked the first Supreme Commander and Forged Alliances (or Total Annihilation) do not expect the same kind of experience. Those of you who found yourselves loving classics like TA and Seven Kingdoms--this is another dumbed-down strategy game for the click happy with very little strategic depth.\n\nThe most unfortnate part is that the first Supreme Commander was the first decent strategy game ever ported in a useable way to consoles...\n\nI beg anyone considering this game to purchase the original Supreme Commander or Forged Alliance, OR PLEASE consider looking into Planetary Annihilation, another spiritual successor to Total Annihilation.\n\nI fail to understand those reviews that claim this is a "deep" strategy game. Such reviewers have clearly never played anything more complex than Warcraft. Not to be negative; such games have a huge following--but they are inherently much more casual and "clicky" and require fast action over strategy, complexity and planning.\n\nThis is the video game equivilant of Starship Troopers 2 and 3.","March 26, 2014","false","2.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Its just dissappointing, compared to the previous SupCom games. My biggest issue, is how useless shields are. They cover next to nothing, in SupCom:FA, you could cover your entire base with 3 or 4 heavy shield generators. Now, in a DLC, you can get an experimental shield generator, but that's the DLC, and Im not talking about the DLC, Im talking about the game. Another issue I have with this, is the border markers, PDs range, shields range, etc. Its a thick ring, that doesnt give you a very precise-feeling measurement. I much prefer Supreme Commander's thin ring, it feels so much better. Also, they obliterated some of my favorite experimentals, namely the FatBoy. That thing was a beast, heavy shield gen, long range cannons, unit production capabilities. Now its just a big bloody tank. I love this game. But I would advise against buying it, go and buy the fist Supreme Commander, or Forged Alliance.","February 7, 2014","false","272.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","3"

Get the first game if you want a good game, and then get the expansion to the first if you want a great game. Then mod it to become even better than that. Don't. Waste. Your. Money. On. Trash. This is trash. More below.\n\nFrom the limited unit selection, to the insufferably stupid resource handling, and the unskippable cutscenes SupCom 2 disappoints across almost every possible angle to disappoint. In the original SupCom, you played as a nameless "Supreme Commander," a single human being trained and chosen to pilot an Automated Command Units, IE of a god-machine that, by itself, can level entire cities within a day, yet can rule if not destroy an entire PLANET within hours by creating an infinitely replenishing army of tanks, planes, and ships.\nIt was a game of epic scale, where it didn't matter that you had absolutely no characterization, because though you played a walking war god, in the universe that wasn't really all that special. The galaxy was full of war gods protecting or annihilating regular mortals. Again, I use the phrase "epic scale" to describe why it wasn't important that your guy had no character arc, because he/she didn't NEED any. You, the player, ultimately didn't matter in the so-called Infinite War... except you do; you become the most important person in a thousand year war fought with god machines that no one fighting it sees any end towards until-... Well, I won't spoilt it, get the first game.\nThis is the genius of the original SupCom and it was carried over to FA; what made you special and important and integral to the story wasn't that you had daddy issues or someone to fight for. No, none of that small-scale, whiny, too-human ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, it was all about your skill as a Supreme Commander. It was about how well you piloted your god-machine  and its countless legions of mechanized death. Sometimes. I say sometimes because sometimes, in both games, events overtake your skill and you still wind up losing, yet surviving to fight another day.\n\nI get the feeling there's none of that in this piece of hot garbage. Don't buy it. I genuinely hate it. It's made by people who don't know how to tell an engaging war story, the promised improvements to unit movement never materialized (and being a technical and mechanics guy that was particularly biting), and the only reason that the game "runs better" than the first one is because, again, of a failure of scale compared to the first game. You can't make huge armies because of the clunky, counter-intuitive resource scheme, and forced SLOWNESS of making things.\n\nAnd now the short of it: From a sub-par plot that fails at grasping the scale of the universe that obviously no who made this cared about, to neutered unit selection, a laughably stupid unit customization scheme, clunky resource management, and unskippable cutscene featuring god-awful angst and horrendous voice-acting SupCom 2 is a load of feotid shrimp wrapped in a diaper.

More below.\n\nFrom the limited unit selection, to the insufferably stupid resource handling, and the unskippable cutscenes SupCom 2 disappoints across almost every possible angle to disappoint. In the original SupCom, you played as a nameless "Supreme Commander," a single human being trained and chosen to pilot an Automated Command Units, IE of a god-machine that, by itself, can level entire cities within a day, yet can rule if not destroy an entire PLANET within hours by creating an infinitely replenishing army of tanks, planes, and ships.\nIt was a game of epic scale, where it didn't matter that you had absolutely no characterization, because though you played a walking war god, in the universe that wasn't really all that special. The galaxy was full of war gods protecting or annihilating regular mortals. Again, I use the phrase "epic scale" to describe why it wasn't important that your guy had no character arc, because he/she didn't NEED any. You, the player, ultimately didn't matter in the so-called Infinite War... except you do; you become the most important person in a thousand year war fought with god machines that no one fighting it sees any end towards until-... Well, I won't spoilt it, get the first game.\nThis is the genius of the original SupCom and it was carried over to FA; what made you special and important and integral to the story wasn't that you had daddy issues or someone to fight for. No, none of that small-scale, whiny, too-human ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, it was all about your skill as a Supreme Commander. It was about how well you piloted your god-machine  and its countless legions of mechanized death. Sometimes. I say sometimes because sometimes, in both games, events overtake your skill and you still wind up losing, yet surviving to fight another day.\n\nI get the feeling there's none of that in this piece of hot garbage. Don't buy it. I genuinely hate it. It's made by people who don't know how to tell an engaging war story, the promised improvements to unit movement never materialized (and being a technical and mechanics guy that was particularly biting), and the only reason that the game "runs better" than the first one is because, again, of a failure of scale compared to the first game. You can't make huge armies because of the clunky, counter-intuitive resource scheme, and forced SLOWNESS of making things.\n\nAnd now the short of it: From a sub-par plot that fails at grasping the scale of the universe that obviously no who made this cared about, to neutered unit selection, a laughably stupid unit customization scheme, clunky resource management, and unskippable cutscene featuring god-awful angst and horrendous voice-acting SupCom 2 is a load of feotid shrimp wrapped in a diaper. Avoid, avoid, avoid. Go buy the first game.","December 24, 2014","false","4.9"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","2"

The grand scale and complexity made them the pinnacle of strategy games unrivaled by any challenger. SC2 however is an embarassment to the franchise which lacks all the qualities that made the predesessors superior to every other Warcraft clone on the market. I cannot believe that Chris Taylor actually wanted to produce the watered down, simplistic, underachieving C&C clone(minus the good story and cut scenes). Let us all hope he is able to escape from Square Enix and work with a publisher that will allow him the creative freedom to masterfully craft the game that we all know he is capable of.

The graphics are good but the most noticeable thing about the game are the effects. The flash of weapons firing, targets being hit, things exploding, it all looks really good and this game has some great presentation value. I'm the SUPREME COMMANDER zOMG! A lot of RTS games try to add new things and end up increasing micromanagement big time. I took two micromanagement economics classes in college, I don't need more of it lol. A lot of RTS games just feel like work instead of enjoying a game. This game gives you a way to build armies and to research upgrades and it is not overly detailed with who-cares-what-else. It is easy to get into with a quick and to the point how-to tutorial. Why can't all rts games be this intuitive? Why do they have to add layers upon layers upon layers of micromanagement and boring tedious details? Because the people who make them and play them are pretentious d-bags, that's why. I would play this over pretentious CIV games any ♥♥♥♥ing day.\n\nAlthough not complicated, it is still a challenge. That's the one problem I've found so far and it sucks: very uneven difficulty spikes. Missions 1-3 out of 5 in the first campaign? Whatever, it was no problem. Mission 4 in the first campaign? It was ♥♥♥♥ing stupidly hard. I got it on my third try when I realized you need to do it a specific way which is one of my biggest pet peeves with games: lack of player freedom. You can't build additional money generators in this mission so you do not have a lot of resources coming in so you have to plan it precisely. I figured out that you have to build a ton of ground/air defense towers and keep engineers repairing them and replacing them as needed. Have enough towers to guard the front and NW/NE sides and a bunch of fighter planes on guard and upgrade their health/dmg fully. Be working up to building the walking juggernaut things as quickly as you can while upgrading ground forces health/dmg fully. Keep pumping out fighter planes from two air factorys. After all this, I sent out two juggernauts with 40 air fighter support planes and blasted everything down finally. God, damn.\n\nI suppose in closing I can say this is a decent RTS game but really it just makes me want to reinstall Starcraft 2.\n6.5/10","April 12, 2014","true","3.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Don't believe all the naysayers!\n\nSC1 had tons of different units, 4 tiers and huge maps. The intention behind SC1 apparently was to simulate epic battles. However, it failed at that miserably. The usual multiplayer games didn't last longer than 10 - 20 minutes and ended at tier 1 or tier 2 at most. So you weren't able to use most of the units anyway. No epic battles of several hours (if players played seriously).\n\nSC2 doesn't try to simulate epic battles. SC2 is a very quick game. 1on1 games usually take about 10 minutes. Everything in the game is streamlined for quick games and it never gets boring. The game just makes a lot more sense. Unlike SC1, it doesn't try to be something which it isn't. If you want longer games, play 3vs3 games which can take about 30 minutes.\n\nCons:\n\n- The online community is practically non-existent. The game is very old after all and most players who play it don't host public games. RTS games in general aren't the most popular games.\n\nPros:\n\n+ The game isn't expensive. Ask a few friends who like RTS games and play with or against them! IMO, the game is worth its current price of 13€ just for its skirmish mode against AI. There is also a single player campaign for all three factions.\n+ There are not tons of different units. Too many units make a RTS too complicated without providing a real benefit. You don't need tons of different units to have a strategic game. Too many types of units just make the game bloated and make it difficult for new players.\n+ The size of the maps is just right. No boring wandering around in slow moting in huge maps.\n+ The ACU or an engineer can build all buildings. No need to distinguish between T1, T2 and T3 engineers. Better buildings and units are unlocked via the research system. Different tiers of engineers would just have been annoying without providing any strategical depth.\n+ Stability. Unlike SC1, SC2 never has crashed on my PC.\n+ Easy to pick up, difficult to master. That's what a RTS game should be like. There is a lot of depth in the game, e.g. knowing how to counter which strategy of the enemy.\n+ The factions play very differently. Every faction has its own cool things and the balance seems to be very good.\n+ Beforehand I was sceptical when I heard that the mass and energy isn't reduced per second when constructing but you have to pay the full amout of mass and energy for buildings and units. In fact it works perfectly. Nothing to miss about the old economy system of SC1 (or Total Annihilation).\n+ It is not possible to build a turtle base which withstands everything. Allowing too heavy turtling would only lenghten the game without making it more interesting. In SC2 attacking is the best defense.\n+ There is a lot of tension in the game. You always have something to do. There is no time for breaks. Fortunately, a game is short enough to be able to relax *after* the game ;)\n\nConclusion: SC2 is the result of streamlining SC1. It's not a trivial game like some people may try to make you believe. IMO, the right things were simplified but the developers never oversimplified anything.","December 10, 2015","true","49.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

First visually it looks great, even several years after the release it looks great.  Gameplay wise its in shambles.  User interface and function is terrible.  Im not an expert at the so called 4x strategy games, part of this issue comes from really poorly designed user interfaces.  Instead of providing options to manage base building on the fly you are required to bounce back and forth with your units.  Couple that with an AI that can do that on the fly, makes this very frustrating.  Unit building is slow and you cant tell if something is building or not, the contruction should be individual to each building unit and not ordered by unit, so it makes unit construction slow and painful since most times when i should be seeing a massive group of units waiting for me to select, instead all i see is one and the next one is in a queue waiting because the unit from a different pool is currently be produced and this is on top of a possitive resource system with excess  resources waiting.  This is on top of the typical AI crap that is in every game, the AI will always have available the exact unit to counter my units and have almost immediate access to replacement units.  The single player game is a choir after the first two missions because of this.","November 22, 2014","false","13.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

(Voice acting and writing is godawful though)\nA great way to convert console gamers, but as a sequel to the beloved Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, this really does disappoint.\n\nPeople say that this game was dumbed down and ruined by consolification. Not quite true, as while it's undoubtedly dumbed down, Supreme Commander also got a console release (can't vouch for Forged Alliance though). I think it's a Square Enix publisher issue. For example, the unit cap was considerable larger in older games, and while it's still large by default, it doesn't live up to the old standard. However, and I think this may be a sign that the devs KNEW this game was worse, you can change your unit cap in a .prefs file in your "Appdata\Local\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander 2\" folder. (Only tested up to 1000.) You can also activate the ETA timer in there (another removed feature), so that when you hold SHIFT to queue, you can see a (normally incorrect) ETA. I don't really understand. It's like they added it, but it was turned off, lowered or removed at the last minute, and I can't imagine that's the devs.\n\nIt's sad to see SupCom die, really, and this game can be quite a bit of fun with friends, but the campaign is awful too. The gameplay is dumbed down (but you knew that already), and the voice acting sounds like they were bored. If anyone played Spider-Man 2 on PS2, Xbox or Gamecube (but not PC - god not PC) then it's like the citizen voice acting; they sound bored as hell, and slightly underpaid and rushed. The writing is cheesy too, so I don't really know what went on there (although that trailer above really wants to push this 'awesome story').\n\nIt's said for me to say I don't recommend this game; it does have it's moments; but I can't understand some of the choices made. Especially when it had such potential - well, I say that, but making games is hard, people have misfires, and while this is a big one (it killed the franchise as far as I'm aware)\n\nTL;DR: Get SC:FA if you want a really good RTS, or get Supreme Commander: Gold Edition or whatever it was called to get both 1 and FA.","October 6, 2015","false","65.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

There is no strategy involved, simply throwing masses of troops seems to work fine. The look of the game, both graphically and from my brief inspection of the tutorial, seems very similar to some of Westwoods Command and Conquer games. Were I a new player to the series I'd most likely assume it was a prequel to the originals with the way it looked.\n\nI still had fun though, regardless of my initial shock, and I felt as though it had been made with an older feel in mind.\n\nAll in all I was dissapointed with what I got out of this game. Was it good? No. Were it part of a different series of games I may have said differently but this is a poor excuse for a SupCom game.\nI do expect I'll play the game more but will no doubt return to the orignal games after completing the  campaign.\n\nPro's:\nSome of the unit names are clear puns which made me chuckle\nThe old SupCom/FA maps made an appearance\nSomewhat corny and old school feel\n\nCon's:\nFor SupCom players; expect lower graphics than the originals\nSeems untempered and in need of tweaks\nLack of strategy value, throw units at the enemy and wear them into the dirt","February 26, 2015","false","12.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

(Voice acting and writing is godawful though)\nA great way to convert console gamers, but as a sequel to the beloved Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance, this really does disappoint.\n\nPeople say that this game was dumbed down and ruined by consolification. Not quite true, as while it's undoubtedly dumbed down, Supreme Commander also got a console release (can't vouch for Forged Alliance though). I think it's a Square Enix publisher issue. For example, the unit cap was considerable larger in older games, and while it's still large by default, it doesn't live up to the old standard. However, and I think this may be a sign that the devs KNEW this game was worse, you can change your unit cap in a .prefs file in your "Appdata\Local\Gas Powered Games\Supreme Commander 2\" folder. (Only tested up to 1000.) You can also activate the ETA timer in there (another removed feature), so that when you hold SHIFT to queue, you can see a (normally incorrect) ETA. I don't really understand. It's like they added it, but it was turned off, lowered or removed at the last minute, and I can't imagine that's the devs.\n\nIt's sad to see SupCom die, really, and this game can be quite a bit of fun with friends, but the campaign is awful too. The gameplay is dumbed down (but you knew that already), and the voice acting sounds like they were bored. If anyone played Spider-Man 2 on PS2, Xbox or Gamecube (but not PC - god not PC) then it's like the citizen voice acting; they sound bored as hell, and slightly underpaid and rushed. The writing is cheesy too, so I don't really know what went on there (although that trailer above really wants to push this 'awesome story').\n\nIt's said for me to say I don't recommend this game; it does have it's moments; but I can't understand some of the choices made. Especially when it had such potential - well, I say that, but making games is hard, people have misfires, and while this is a big one (it killed the franchise as far as I'm aware)\n\nTL;DR: Get SC:FA if you want a really good RTS, or get Supreme Commander: Gold Edition or whatever it was called to get both 1 and FA.","October 6, 2015","false","65.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Then one day Supreme Commander (supcom) was announced and for fans of TA, it was everything they hoped for, larger, better graphics its like playing TA again.\n\nwhy the long history lesson? well TA and SupCom were not an easy games to get into as a result it alienated some gamers. Supcom 2 tried to fix this by making a game thats more approachable to new players by adopting some of the tried and true formulas from normal RTS, it was a hybrid of 2 formulas, the economy acts like a middle ground of 2 styles, the unit cap is now at 300 , the number of units and buildings are drastically removed and now you have a research tree that functions similarly to a C&C special powers tree.\n\nA lot of the old TA and SupCOM fans saw this as dumbing down the game, and i somewhat agree with them, supcom2 took out generally what fans loved about the franchise and tried to be a game that it was not meant to be - a C&C/warcraft RTS. hoping that the added influnces from those games can appeal to the larger audience. But what it failed to understand is that there are soo many C&C and Warcraft RTS clones and releases around that we dont need another.\n\nIf you are a TA and Sup Com fan, you would be disappointed with SupCOm2, it doesnt have the scale of the previous games. if you are a C&C/Warcraft fan, you might be disappointed because it doesnt play exactly liek those two games either. if you want a beginners guide into the world of TA and SupCOm, i dare say this is a good start.\n\nTLDR; noob version of sup com, buy only if you want an extended tutorial on how to play Sup COm\n\n\n\n\n","August 22, 2014","false","14.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

After beating the single-player campaign, the skirmish game mode got boring after awhile. 7/10","September 3, 2014","true","24.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's all about finding a decent rhythm in unit production, to research, to micro and macro with your entire army. You must maintain your rhythm while also disrupting your opponent's. I bought this game during the Winter sale for $3.24. This game isn't even worth THAT.\n\nHere's where this game's problem comes in: this game makes no ♥♥♥♥ing sense. The tutorial was written by ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ seven year olds who don't the understand the basic concept of what makes an RTS an RTS. The game's rhythm is all place, it feels like Beethoven did a line of cocaine on his piano and then bashed his face on the piano keys. If my friends have to tell me to not play the Tutorial and just experience the mechanics on their own to like this game, only for me to bash my keyboard in blind fury at the stupidity of the mechanics, things aren't boding well.\n\nThis is coming from a person who plays RTS games all the time. I have over 6000 hours on games like Total Annihilation Kingdoms (June 25, 1999), War of the Ring (November 4 2003), StarCraft (March 31, 1998) and StarCraft 2 (July 27, 2010) and WarCraft 3 (July 3, 2002). Mind you, StarCraft 2 came out THE SAME YEAR as this game. It took me FOUR MINUTES to understand the components of StarCraft 1 and how to play it, and even less time to understand StarCraft 2. I've played for almost over an hour and STILL don't understand what makes this game tick.\n\nEach and every one of the games I just spoke of above have superiority in all aspects, leagues above this game. Game feel, mechanics, art design, story, ease of accessibilty, easy to understand, and gameplay. I have not played any of the other Supreme Commander games, but from the looks of it, not only does this game ♥♥♥♥ on its predecessors, but on Strategy games as a whole.\n\nDo not buy this game.\n\nRefunded. I want my ♥♥♥♥ing $3.24 back. No words will be able to express exactly how ♥♥♥♥♥♥ I am on this game. This game caused me to go on a freaking rage rant on the history of Strategy games for around two hours with my friends being forced to smile and nod.\n\n","December 24, 2015","false","1.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/internet_sateen/recommended/40100/","internet_sateen","Internet Sateen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/internet_sateen/","195 products in account","Okay...\n\nMy opinion regarding SupCom2 is a little...neutral. The game itself is okay and adds an interesting twist to the SupCom universe. However, it isn't the TRUE successor to the original SupCom game.\n\nFor one, the resource system. It just seems...eh. It changed from the positive/negative income and moved to building/unit pricing where you need X amount of resources to buy Y. Doesn't exactly endear me.\n\nAnother point is the research tree and research points. Why?! I was perfectly okay with going through three techs. T1, T2, T3. Simple. Easy to understand. But now, I've been given a third resource. I'm a casual gamer, I don't do competitive stuff very often. Rant at me if you wish, but getting a third resource was a pain in the carping ♥♥♥. When I tried to move to focus on one thing, something else suffers. Honestly, I would forget about research and then half way through the match, remember I can upgrade my stuff. So, meh. Not enthused.\n\nI do have a pet peeve. Why can't I order engineers to assist in building something? In SupCom original, build time could be cut down if you assigned an engineer to work on it, of course at the cost of using more resources. But it's gone now. I'm not pleased by the lack of that mechanic, but I can live with it. I guess...\nNow, I HAVE to bring up the naming. Seriously, take a moment and look at the Aeon Illuminate unit names. The 'Weedoboth' fighter/bomber? The 'Sooprizer' Experimental Gunship? The 'Fistoosh' Mobile Missile Launcher? I'm mildly amused. And I'm also questioning the alcohol content the designers possessed when they named these. That, or sleep deprivation. Or it could be they had only a week before release. I unno.\n\nOne last thing. When I first played SupCom, I was blown away by this 'epic' feeling. The units and their attacks held a kind of weight to them, as if a single shot from a T3 Aeon Battleship could conceivably oneshot most structures and units. Now, these units in SupCom2 just feel dinky and unrefined, even when at maximum upgrade sometimes. Sure, it doesn't hold true to all units, but it's present in most. The build time is also shortened. When you went to build a Tech3 artillery piece on SupCom original, you EARNED it. It took an hour to build that thing, you deserve it and its firepower. In SupCom2, you have TWENTY heavy artys, maybe more. You can spam them for days and don't get me started on the nukes. I'm not even gonna step in that territory of rant. I've done enough for tonight.\n\nLong story short, if you want a sequel to SupCom original, go get Forged Alliance.","March 21","false","86.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Do not recommend.\n\n(EDIT: someone axed a question and steam wont let me type a reply over 1000 characters.)\n\nanswer to question about what specifically was changed:\n\nto anyone who hasn't played the original it wouldn't really make any additional sense with context. but 'ere we go!\n\nthe original game suffered from a lot of cons: slow down, extremely lengthy build queues, poor balance between factions, the necessity of having pre-created construction blueprints for base building, to name a few. the most poignant of all, however, was the resource management system this RTS employed.\n\neffectively you could queue up ANYTHING regardless of actual resource reserves or resource income rate. buildings, units, upgrades, all of it would simply go into the queue as you picked them. in most RTS games, if you can't afford something, you had to wait until you COULD to produce it. supreme commander 1 said "nuts to something easy and efficient such as that!" and decided that to compensate for letting you always be able to construct anything it would merely extend the production time. so now, a tier 1 tank that took 20 seconds to create with adequate resources became a tier 1 tank that takes 3 minutes to create as resources trickle in and are equally distributed amongst all queued tasks that you do not pause. this could get GROSSLY out of hand if you were not keeping up with mass and energy generation. experimentals that took 6 minutes to construct were taking 30 minutes. ain't NOBODY but a guy i knew named Andrew had time fo dat.\n\nalong comes supreme commander 2 and SUDDENLY we had a resource management system that made SENSE! (we also had other marked improvements across the board from performance to simplications of unneccessarrilly complicated game mechanics, which some people, namely the aforementioned Andrew did not enjoy). The system had been changed so that you could queue up whatever you wanted but construction/progess would NOT begin until you had the total necessary resources to complete the item in the default build time. effectively the game was working like every other RTS in existence because you don't revolutionize the wheel by making it into a hexagon.\n\nalong came a patch for SC2 that changed the resource management system into a carbon copy of the system from SC1. this made the game VIRTUALLY unplayable to me. i went from being able to beat the entire game to being unable to launch the game from steam because i couldn't stand that system after having been spoiled by the infinitely superior system the game launched with. the game lost ALL appeal and in an instant became unplayably boring and frustrating. They didn't even make it an OPTION. (did they? i doubt it.)","February 26, 2014","false","44.3"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","1"

They took everything that made those two unique to the rts genre and threw it out the window. I don't even get how supcom2 is supposed to work.\n\nFirst all the resources became like static. Gone is the balance of energy and metals in vs spent. You can't upgrade your collectors anymore. So basically each level you are completely limited on resources. Then they severly limited the number of units you can build. All the maps are smaller. So you end up just building the biggest units you can. And then they drastically reduced the number of units. No more countering units and build specific strike groups of mixed types. And now units have upgrades instead of different level bases. So you just spam upgrades, build as much research facilities as you can and then max everything. All strategic depth, rushing vs building, what to build, what stuff to use, it's all gone.\n\nI didn't even finish it cus it's so bland. And even if you didn't play supcom1, it's still a very dull rts game. Just go get supcom1, please.

Now to start the review, this game is great, if it weren't supreme commander, this was made to be part of the supreme commander series, and in that respect failed, the modeling was weird as well, and the gameplay was like taking all supreme commander veterans, and calling them noobs, it made the economy system so easy, all you have to do is give your acu a command and it will happen quite quickly, and way to easily.  not only that but the matches are to short, they don't offer, well, fun.  If I were to recommend this to anyone, it would be the people that want an easy RTS, and like easily made weapons of mass desruction, that just as easily fall.

I liked the serious atmosphere, the almost constant battle between resource generation and consumption, the demanding time, resources e careful planning in order to build a decent base with proper defenses.

Unfortunately, good RTS games aren't make eith just good stories and dialogues. Everything that make SC1 an awesome game were removed from SC2:\n\n1 - Serious look and atmosphere - SC2 look like some kind of cartoon with bright colors from some kindergarten.\n\n2 - Resources - its easy to get and generate resources. No more paying attention or planning the construction of base or experimental units.\n\n3 - Building base - in SC1 we need to overlap shields (paying attention to energy consumption) and hope they would hold long enought while your defense structures and units take care of the enemey. In SC2, just one shield will do for everything.\n\n4 - Tactics - why bother thinking on how you will get to your enemy? Just spam anything from your factories and make them move straight for the enemy base. Pincer attacks? Too much trouble. Coordinated sea, land and air attack? Even more trouble. Artillery fire? It's boring.\n\nAnyway, the devs maybe were drunk, in a bad mood or just left their kids in charge, i don't know.

Now to start the review, this game is great, if it weren't supreme commander, this was made to be part of the supreme commander series, and in that respect failed, the modeling was weird as well, and the gameplay was like taking all supreme commander veterans, and calling them noobs, it made the economy system so easy, all you have to do is give your acu a command and it will happen quite quickly, and way to easily.  not only that but the matches are to short, they don't offer, well, fun.  If I were to recommend this to anyone, it would be the people that want an easy RTS, and like easily made weapons of mass desruction, that just as easily fall.  I get that Square Enix had their own vision, but they didn't have the one that all of us wanted in a supreme commander game, I'm going back to forged alliance, see you on the battlefield.","June 28, 2015","false","548.3"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I liked the serious atmosphere, the almost constant battle between resource generation and consumption, the demanding time, resources e careful planning in order to build a decent base with proper defenses. Anyway, SC1 is cool, SC2....eee....no.\nSC2 have its merits. The stories and more elaborate dialogues is a good thing but don't save the game. Unfortunately, good RTS games aren't make eith just good stories and dialogues. Everything that make SC1 an awesome game were removed from SC2:\n\n1 - Serious look and atmosphere - SC2 look like some kind of cartoon with bright colors from some kindergarten.\n\n2 - Resources - its easy to get and generate resources. No more paying attention or planning the construction of base or experimental units.\n\n3 - Building base - in SC1 we need to overlap shields (paying attention to energy consumption) and hope they would hold long enought while your defense structures and units take care of the enemey. In SC2, just one shield will do for everything.\n\n4 - Tactics - why bother thinking on how you will get to your enemy? Just spam anything from your factories and make them move straight for the enemy base. Pincer attacks? Too much trouble. Coordinated sea, land and air attack? Even more trouble. Artillery fire? It's boring.\n\nAnyway, the devs maybe were drunk, in a bad mood or just left their kids in charge, i don't know. But they just took everything that make SC1 an remarkable game and throw them in the trash.

Now strip that person bare of clothes, skin and flesh until only bone remain. Congratulations! You've just imagined Supreme Commander 2.\n\nThe fact that this sequel has been streamlined in terms of optimization and more pretty animation for EX-units doesen't save this shallow game. Everthing, EVERYTHING that made Supreme Commander and it's expansion great has been taken out to make the game more accessible for the new player, kill the depth and variety to gain accessability, what a joke. They even butcher the tier 1, 2, 3 system for a tech system where you have to commit point like you where leveling an RPG character...\n\nFor those looking for an RTS, look elsewhere (StarCraft II or C&C for example), and for fans of the first game and it's expansion, stay far away.","December 13, 2015","false","6.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Absolutely horrific economy (seriously it's one of the worst I've ever seen it's so bad you never have any resources unless you convert energy into mass) Terrible unit balancing terrible UI.\n\nThe game is generally ♥♥♥♥ so why do I find myself enjoying it? Oh that's right.\n\nVeterans of RTS want to introduce new friends into the RTS genre to have more people to play with. But if you're not already a fan of RTS type games being thrown into SCFA (Supreme Commander Forged Alliance) Is overwhelming and you'll likely uninstall the game shortly after out of frustration. So anyone who by default does not have the brain injury required to enjoy RTS games should buy this one first. SC2 is babys first RTS which I said earlier. It's used to get new RTS players into the scene because if you stuck them into a real RTS they would fall down on their face and cry.\n\nTL:DR If you like RTS games go buy Supreme Commander Forged Alliance. If you want a friend/girlfriend/boyfriend to get INTO rts games then buy them this play it with them until they're good then buy them SCFA so you never have to play this disgusting excuse for a SC game ever again.","January 5","false","60.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Ive seen other reviews and people say that they have played many strategy games and this one is a good one and  i agree. This game on its own is a decent strategy game, with more tactics then strategy though. The so called strategy is basic and "streamlined". It takes no real brains to play and is just a spam fest. Its just build big units send them at your enemy in waves and whoever does the best job or sucks the least wins is what it boils down to. I was excited when this game first came out being a fan of the first supreme commander and supreme commander forged alliance. If you analyze this game from its predisessors this game is a huge let down. The graphic quality is inferior to that of the first supreme commander in my opinion. There is very little unit variation which is sad because the first 2 had so many diverse units that each had their role on the battle field. The one thing in my opinion that kills this game if you are a fan of the first two games is the eco system. In my opinion that alone was a major stepback in the wrong direction. In all they took the core concepts that made the first 2 titles great, "streamlined" them and made a game for casuals  ( which is not nessessarily a bad thing).  If your a newcomer you will enjoy this game, if you have played the other two this game will have little replayabilty value after a short time.","April 15, 2014","false","41.0"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I nearly cried when I saw the Fatboy enter the scene in campaign, no shields, no AA and not a factory, the size of the Fatboy has also gone down in size it doesn’t even resemble the one from Supreme Commander or FA.\nSimply put, if you like Supreme Commander then don’t buy this or maybe do so you’ll be able to appreciate FA even more.","May 7, 2014","false","23.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Awful dialog. Okay, so, RTS games aren't 100% about the single player, and it's okay that this one has an awful campaign.\n\nI come from the background of Starcraft/Warcraft, where I probably have 500+ hours played on Starcraft 2's ladder, making it to masters league. I'm a very skilled RTS player, and I do not know how this game could ever have a competitive scene, as the tools to be a better player just do not exist with  such a lack of depth in skill.\n\nHow can you expect me to play an RTS that doesn't have hotkeys to create a unit when you select that building? With such a bad UI? There's no menu options to change hotkeys that already exist, even! It was released a few months before Wings of Liberty, and you can't have this quality of production with such a huge competitor arriving on the scene in the same year.\n\nThe clicks and keys are unresponive, I can never really tell if my unit "understood" that I gave them a command. The combat is slow, the units are boring, and the only distinguishing factor about this game (the command overview, zooming out to see the entire battlefield) apparently was done better by its predecessor which is now modded to be a better experience.\n\nI was excited to get an RTS game in a Humble Bundle. Especially one that has 87% positive reviews on Steam. I would not buy this game for any amount.","June 24, 2015","false","3.2"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

Entertaining for a couple hours if you play slowly like I do (longer if you play multiplayer or way shorter)... anyways it has great aspects and designs while balancing out the gameplay. One thing I didn't like was that it is too RPG if you know what I mean. Almost everything is attainable from research stations rather than upgrading the buildings as in the first one. If you haven't played the first one, A) You are incredibly deprived. B) You will have a greater understanding fer everything and respect if you play the first one first... So if you are thinking about buying this game go back and play the first one then come back.

One of the problems though is the tech research the having to research the individual techs, although this dose mean you can make your units stronger and have special perks something the old game lacked.

I would say its probably in my top 5. So when Supreme Commander came out, it was like my childhood dream came true. When they announced a Supreme Commander 2, I was very excited to know it did well enough to produce a sequel. That is, until they started saying things like "unit upgrades" and that they were making it more "streamlined"\n\nSupreme Commander 2 is not a sequel to Supreme Commander. It is an attempt to make Supreme Commander more appealing to the masses by making it similar to more traditional RTS games like Starcraft or the C&C series. It has unit upgrades, they took the large choice of units and unit "tiers" and reduced it to 1 or 2 main infantry/tank units for each side. The Aeon no longer have naval units, they just use their land hover units. This is not Supcom streamlined, this is a regular RTS with the infinite zoom feature. The heart and soul of SupCom/TA is gone, its just an empty shell with something else inside it now.\n\nIf you enjoy traditional RTS games, you may find this one interesting as the infinite zoom ability is a mechanic all RTS games should have.\n\nIf you loved TA and SupCom, you will hate this.

In the distant future, wars will be fought not by hordes of manned armies but rather swarms of drones remotely commanded by people in giant robots in the battlefield for some reason. This toned down sequel has drawn either much praise or a lot of vitriol from its community.  With such mixed responses, one may wonder if this game is even worth playing, let alone looking at it.  This review hopes to answer that question (summary below):\n\n-Story:  Being a game published by Square Enix, one would expect story to be the primary focus of the game, but it seems that even the story in SupCom2's case was toned down in comparison to its predecessor (even though it was enough for me to want to see what the end looked like).  Throughout the 18 campaign missions divided equally between the United Earth Federation (UEF), Aeon Illuminate and the Cybran Nations, the three factions struggle to keep a fragile alliance together from internal plots to thrust one side into power over all others.  While this may sound dramatic, the tone never gets too grim while also avoiding an overly idealistic view.  The main characters sound like interesting concepts, but they're all executed in an uninteresting way with monotonous speech and limited facial expressions.  It also doesn't help that the FMVs feel lacking and empty.  Despite these facts, the campaigns still provide the benefit of practice for the multiplayer community, at least enough to familiarize the player with each faction.  It's still recommended to practice in skirmish mode and within the multiplayer community itself though.  Whether you care about the story or not, the campaign is at least something to pass the time and learn about the game.  Score:  3/5\n\n-Graphics:  One of the main complaints voiced by fans of the previous Supreme Commander games is that the graphics in SupCom2 aren't nearly as spectacular as its predecessor.  While they aren't as bad as they could be, the presentation of the game is rather simple in a way that's almost lackluster in both unit and world design.  Even on the highest graphical capabilities, the game looks like something made out of legos almost.  The scaling is also a little strange, but it's understandable as to why the developers took this path:  They were betting on the idea that gamers in the start of the 2010's wouldn't be able to afford powerful computers with the best hardware on the market.   As a result, those whom had played the first game and eagerly awaited a new and improved sequel were disappointed while it didn't discourage newcomers from entering the franchise.  If you're the kind of person who doesn't care too much about graphics, this is the game for you.  If you wanted something even more realistic than the first, look elsewhere.  Score:  3.5/5\n\n-Gameplay:  Another complaint by the fans of Supreme Commander 1 and Forged Alliance was that the gameplay was toned down in terms of complexity for SC2.  While Supreme Commander 2 is simpler than its predecessor in terms of strategic depth, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  The goal of the game is to assert your military supremacy with swarms of unmanned units while also avoiding total annihilation.  Units are constructed out of two resources:  Building Mass, and energy which is easier to harness since generators can be placed anywhere as opposed to mass extractors which are placed on strategic points and must be secured.  Instead of tiers, factions can invest research points that are accumulated over time to improve their units on the spot with increased gains in research the more research facilities are constructed.  Rather than requiring buildings dedicated to unlocking research though, one can just simply access their tech tree and spend points on what they can afford.  While this does sound better than the typical method of improving units, it can be tedious or outright absurd to feel the need to relearn upgrades every single game.  SupCom2 also benefits from allowing players to plan joint-operations with their land, naval and air units and the sheer size of one's armies, fleets and squadrons is still impressive with support up to as many as 500 units per team.  While some may complain about the downgrades given to each faction's late-game experimental units, they are still powerful enough to require planning to deal with effectively.  The view of the game is also impressive since not only is there a typical minimap with fog of war that's already drawn, players can zoom out and view the entire battlefield to coordinate multiple assaults in real time.  It may seem overwhelming at first, but it won't be take long to improve one's micro-management and multi-tasking skills.  To put it simply, if you're looking for a game with strategic-depth that's important for a long-term goal, play SupCom 1.  If you are more a fan for smaller-scale battles of tactics, SupCom 2 is the game for you.  Score:  4.5/5\n\n-Sound:  Even though it seems that sound wasn't a high-priority for Supreme Commander 2, there's still a small OST that might have been complimented if it only had more songs and influences from the kind of music heard in games like Hawken or Battletech.  There is a recurring leitmotif here that may be detected on and off, but is rather downplayed in contrast to everything else.  Fittingly, there is dynamic music in Supreme Commander 2 that shifts to match the intensity of the battle with almost nothing but wind at the start and a building orchestra that climaxes once the battles rage.  The warnings for this game only tells you of critical information that requires immediate attention such as “Nuclear launch detected” or “Commander under attack”.  The voice acting for the game feels mostly restrained, with lines alternating between hit-and-miss sarcastic remarks and attempts to add character development that fall flat most of the time.   Not much to say here, but it probably could have used something more.  Score:  3/5\n\n-Replayability:  Despite the divided fanbase in regards to Supreme Commander 2 and its predecessor, SC2 still has hundreds of players in the multiplayer community.  The community hub is still fairly active, and there is a modding community for the game as well, just like the first game.  Even if you're not into multiplayer, Supreme Commander 2 has a campaign that would probably last the average player about a week or a week and a half to complete just for the regular objectives alone.  For completionists, there are also hidden objectives to discover in each campaign mission to improve one's score.  There is also skirmish mode which can be played against AI with misleading difficulty values.  Fortunately the game's AI opponents are relentless enough even on Normal to improve one's strategy and drive them to feel accomplished as they eventually defeat their opponents.  The good news is that this game will last a good while for fans of short-term RTS games.  Average life expectancy would probably be around a month just for the singleplayer alone and several for multiplayer if it still lives on.  Considering that the story ending on a cliffhanger that probably won't be answered any time soon, if at all, SC2 is in no danger of being replaced by a sequel unless a spiritual successor is developed.  Score:  4/5\n\n-Summary:  Supreme Commander 2 is the kind of game that's enjoyable in its own merits. If it weren't so conflicting with the lore, it's probably be more tolerable to SupCom 1 fans if SC2 could be thought of as a prequel in disguise as a sequel. If you aren't too judgmental about graphics or complexity and just wish to have a fun, futuristic short-term RTS, then Supreme Commander 2 is for you.  Overall Score:  18/25 or 72%.","January 10, 2015","true","92.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The small maps are lag free and very hectic which make exciting matches. One thing I do miss is genuinely tough experimental units - I wish there was a new higher tier which brought back the  Forged Alliance-style experimentals. Having said that, maybe due to Omni sensors covering the whole of a smaller map, they would be too easy to scout and destroy before they were finished building.","May 11, 2014","true","336.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you bought this game expecting Supcom 1 but with better graphics and more units then you will left wanting. IF there was no Supcom 1 and this was a stand alone title then I would say that it’s not so bad, a bit easy to win on artillery alone but in the main not a bad game. However it is not a great game, mostly due to the fact that compared to other Supreme titles, the armies and maps don’t feel as huge. The game feels more streamlined but in a dumbed down way to suit a more causal RTS fan. That’s fine and all but it wasn’t necessary for the sequel to a game that’s main fan following is something grander. It’s definitely a Commander game but not a Supreme Commander game.","April 23, 2014","false","41.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'd like to play this game again if I see more people playing it. Its a nice node based ecomony system. You get to a point where you don't need any of the nodes just a lot of power. Tech is balanced acrossed all three factions and pretty neat way to deal with tech... everything has a counter, mixing not always effective than massing I see but if done right can be very useful in eliminating your enemy. These massive battlefields of massive armies... I enjoy the idea or a large island battles or arenas.\n\nmy full review here: Full Review[Full Review]","April 23, 2014","true","43.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
