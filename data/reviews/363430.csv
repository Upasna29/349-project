But there really isn't anything here worth playing.  You can't even race against other trucks so it's all time trials.  The ability to paint your truck is neat but in addition to that it would have been nice to have more than 1 different truck in the game.  If there was a career mode with upgradeable trucks and an actual path of progression it would be more interesting.  Right now you have 5 or 6 tracks and you can drive through them.  That's the game.\n\nIt's very buggy.  The mountains just flicker randomly in many tracks, it is practically epilepsy-warning level of flickering.  It looks funny though, I was laughing the whole time but I was thinking it was early access but apparently this is their finished product.\n\nI will commend them for including both a pushbutton-handbrake and an analog handbrake but there is a problem with that.  What I did was assign my handbrake to the right analog stick so I could try out (for the first time ever) the feeling of an analog handbrake in a game but due to the deadzone in the stick it causes the transmission to break.  As in, if you center the joystick and it is only 0.05% off-center the transmission will cease to function and you can go in top gear and redline it and you won't be able to move.  So that doesn't work at all, and to top it off you can't UN-assign a button so once you have assigned it you don't have the ability to change it.\n\nIn my opinion this game would be more fun without the invisible walls in the open areas of the track.  I know you are supposed to just do the races but I see vast flickering mountains in the distance and it would have been fun to just go off-roading over there and explore.\n\nAt no point does it even feel like "off roading", it's more like driving on a gravel roads.  I live out in the boonies with gravel roads so this just seems normal to me.\n\nOverall I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Literally the best part of the game is the fact that you can drive the truck in the menu/garage.  This game has a retail price of $20 and for that amount of money you can get a copy of Spintires at a discount and play a REAL off roading game.","March 6","false","5.4"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","13","17","0","2"

I have a G27 setup and it simply wont calibrate or configure properly. I am 55 years old, use and have used numerouse simulators and have moddeled and codded several cars and tracks for rFactor so I know what I am talking about. There has got to be some better contol setup or this Sim will fail if it has not already. I am going to attempt to get a refund or credit at this point.","October 27, 2015","false","0.9"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","14","20","0","0"

Why would you not like this.\n\nD Series is a great off-roading game that was made by 1 guy, and the game isn't all that bad from 1 guy. You have a multitude of vehicles, from little TrophyKarts, to Pro2 and Pro4 trucks, and even a hatchback rally car. The tracks are all nice and varied with different designs and catering to different vehicles.\n\nThe only reason to get this game is if you have a steering wheel similar to the Logitec G27. This is a simulation game, and to get the most fun out of it, you need a wheel, and then preferably a racing seat. My setup is the G27 on the Playseat Nascar Kyle Bush seat. You can play it with a controller, but it's better if you get the wheel and seat.\n\nAll in all, not a bad Early Access game, even though not specified as an Early Access game. Some things need to be fixed, like more tracks, proper water physics, and other things, but, not a bad game if you own a G27. If you don't own a wheel, well, I'd say skip this one. 7/10","September 20, 2015","true","3.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

I'm not kidding, the force feedback is amazing. Of course, if you don't have a FFB wheel, it's not entirely the same, but do not pass up this amazing game.\nSure, there is no AI. There is no multiplayer (which I will explain more later on), but just the single player experience alone is enough for me to pour plenty of hours into this game.\n\nMany people in the community hub and even the reviews have complained about graphics.\nGraphics, in my opinion, do not make or break a game for me. Do they make a game look better? Sure. Do they hinder my gaming experience? No. Maybe it's just me, but when I play a video game it's usually not one thing that can make it or break it for me. I'll use GTA V for an example: I love the graphics in that game. The sunsets are beautiful. But that's not the whole game. The game has so many other features that it's almost overwhelming. So, back to my point, graphics should not ruin an entire game for somebody. It might be because I grew up with old Nintendos in the house, but I've never seen graphics as a problem. And to be honest, the graphics in this game do not look all that bad; to me they look pretty professional.\n\nI can't wait for people to start raging on me for saying that graphics don't matter.\n\nQuestions:\nI have a few questions I would like to be answered, if possible.\n\nWill there actually be any multiplayer or AI implemented into the game at some point in the future? I understand if not; like I said, still an amazing game. Even local multiplayer, or just some simple AI in the game would be nice. If not; no problem. I understand Devotid Media is a one-dev team (or so I've seen, correct me if I'm wrong), and it would be quite the amount of work to have to put into the game to implement these features.\n\nAnother question: will there be more vehicles? The current fleet is awesome on it's own, and I'm sure modding in new models is/will be a possibility, but developer-made vehicles are well-tested and professional.\n\nAn amazing simulator that I will be replaying plenty of times. Also, huge props to the developer (whose name I cannot recall) for making a game of this size and quality. Sorry for the wall of text, but this is a game I will be playing over, and over, and over.","September 19, 2015","true","2.3"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","52","11","21","2","0"
