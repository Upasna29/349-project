Plasticine, Clay, it's pretty much the same thing to me really, but they have their meanings.\n\nTanita: A Plasticine Dream, is a game where you point and click your way into a fascinating and imaginative islands, while you have to think cratively from time to time in order to progress through the dream.\n\n*In case anyone hasn't seen it, Armikrog got pushed back yet again and will release in the end of September. So you can see the reason why you should try and play this game while you wait for Armikrog to arrive.","August 14, 2015","true","1.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"
