Accompanying me is my employer's daughter, Saya (who bears an uncanny likeness to Alyx Vance). Just as I'm approaching the last jump gate separating me and my destination, Saya's voice crackles over comms: "...I think we're being followed...I swear I saw a pirate ship." We pass through the gate and my heart sinks. A dozen pirate ships were waiting for me. I hand the controls over to the ship's computer and hop in the aft turret to lay down some desperate cover fire. The intelligent auto-pilot system gracefully and effectively dodges the brightly colored emmisions from the enemies' gamma impulse rays as I fire wildly into space. This is a transport vessel; unequipped for a sustained firefight, and woefully ineffective against a sorty of pirate ships. We aren't going to make it. But then, I remember that I have a ship docked in this sector: an M5 class Argon Discoverer light reconnaissance fighter craft. I call up my shipboard computer and access the ship to ship command console. I order my fighter to fly out into space, then I retake manual control of the transport. This plan might just work. I close the distance between my two craft to about 400 meters, rolling and weaving all the while to avoid the enemy projectiles. Commanding the transporter to dock at the TerraCorp HQ, I eject into space. Saya's voice on comms again: "W-what are you...where are you going? You can't just leave us here!" I ignore it, my plan already seeming foolish enough without her to remind me. I jetpack over to the Discoverer and enter the ship. Payback time. Locking onto the nearest pirate ship, I engage the ship's thrusters and begin pursuit. My M5 has the weakest weapons and shielding available, but I don't care. I have to protect the civilians; I have to protect Saya. The majority of the pirate ships turn to face this new threat. Two still chase the transporter. I throw my ship back and forth, narrowly dodging would-be kill shots, but still sustaining heavy damage. Shields critical. Hull at 43%. This plan was suicide. I lock on to the transport to track its progress. 200 meters out from docking. A few seconds away. With renewed hope, I turn my craft around and fly towards TerraCorp HQ and the transport. I just might pull this off. Suddenly, one of the pirates tailing the transport increases its speed and positions itself between the station and the transport. I'm 2 kilometers out, just out of effective firing range. I can only watch as the pirate ship fires a volley of lasers directly into the cockpit of the transport ship. The transport erupts in flames, spirals out of control. "No," I hear myself utter, "no no no..."  The transport ship careens into the station and explodes, and with it, my passengers. My ship's computer makes an announcement: "Attention, your Argon Express has been destroyed by a pirate Orinoco in sector Home of Light."  Saya, my employer's daughter and my character's potential love interest, dead. The pirates break formation and scatter, their mission accomplished. My M5 is crippled, my S.E.T.A. booster, one of the alpha impulse ray emmiters, and my duplex scanner all destroyed. I haven't the time to mourn, however, as I'm already receiving a message from my other employer: the Argon Secret Service. "Welcome to X2," I think to myself, as I fly my busted ship back to TerraCorp HQ. X2 improves upon Beyond the Frontier in almost every way. You can now fly any ship, leave your ship in a space suit, and trade and command stations remotely. Combat has been heavily refined, the story line improved, graphics modernized, and the universe expanded. This is the one of the few times I've ever seen a sequel outshine its predecessor, and I know that I'll enjoy every second of my journey across the X-universe.","October 1, 2013","true","79.2"," 104 of 110 people (95%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","95","104","110","12","3"

The game is basically a sandbox universe made up of multiple sectors or solar systems connected by jump gates.\nThe main objects in the sectors are factories which consume and produce products; and different kinds of space ships flying about doing different tasks; such as freighters collecting or delivering products, military ships defending the sector, pirates doing their business (they don’t bother you too much), and a mysterious enemy called the Khaak (that will bother you relentlessly).\nYou can choose the kind of role you want to play. Be a pirate hunter, stealing their ships and selling them. Become a pirate yourself if you want. Build a commercial empire with factories in multiple sectors and your own fleet of freighters – and get rich so you can buy the high-end ships and equipment and go and conquer the universe. It’s really up to you.\nThere is a storyline you can follow if you want. It’s not great really; but you can drop in and out of it as you like.\nX2 is not an arcade space dog fighting game. If that is what you want you will be disappointed. The game requires a lot of time to learn and play. For those who like sandbox simulation games, with an emphasis on building an empire from scratch X2 The Threat is excellent. Although that said the subsequent iterations have improved the gameplay and graphics. So if you want to play just one X game this might not be the one to choose. The whole series is available here on Steam, so do a little research and decide which one you want to jump into.\n(ps I have the game on Steam but I played a retail copy)","March 10, 2014","true","0.7"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","33","38","0","0"

That is not to say it starts off that great. Most people will quit after a few hours of gameplay and label it a mediocre experience and they'd be right to do so, X2 is not a game that impresses in the beginning, it is a game that requires tremendous investment in time and effort before you start to understand and appreciate the scope of the game.\n\nAs the game starts up you're treated to some low quality cut-scene with poorly modeled people trying to cover up their lack of animation, you're then booted into the game with little instruction on how to do anything and a tutorial that is so completely useless at actually teaching you anything it might as well be a deterrent to keep new players from learning the game.\n\nYou will spend your first few hours struggling with your flight controls and trying to figure out how trading works stopping every once in a while to curse at the unintuitive HUD and the lazy save game system.\n\nBut then, at some point between frustration and throwing your PC out the window you will discover something. This game is awesome once you figure it out. X2 like it's predecessors doesn't want to tell you want to do, it simply wants you to do. Want to be a pirate? Go do it. Want to be a trader? Go do it. Want to be bounty hunter or a mining mogul? Go do it. Change your ship, create a fleet, manage vast networks of trade ships and mining complexes, you are free to do as you please in this vast and open universe.\n\nThere is a storyline hidden somewhere out there between the stars. The game starts you off in the classic role as a prisoner getting one last chance at redemption and as you progress through the game a story will unfold, if you want it to. The storyline is entirely optional and most people will probably end up ignoring it most of the time in favor of the open-ended gameplay that is at the core of X2.\n\nThe game is quite beautiful as you float between the stars and watch the myriad of anomalies, space stations and ships that make up the various star systems you visit. The character models and the cut-scenes however are of a much lower quality and will often make you dread having to speak to somebody aboard a space station.\n\nAll in all X2:The Threat is a great game, if you can get past the insanely steep learning curve.","April 5, 2013","true","200.7"," 23 of 26 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","23","26","0","6"

I hate DRM.  I probably have more hours in this game than any other, although I may have more time in another franchise, like Elder Scrolls, that's over three games with .  I have just never gotten into X3.  It is prettier, but the mechanics do not work for me.  This is the only game I have ever played that I can set it up and let it go, for days sometimes.  Things happen when I am away, I loose ships, but if I set it up well I can minimize that.  It is also useful to set this up efficiently since you don't want to have to handle a ship under attack somewhere else while you are playing a storyline mission.\n\nThis game is a bit dated now.  The graphics could have been better when it was launched, but this game is more about building a space empire than it is about wiz-bang graphics.  You do have to fly and fight some, but you can avoid most fighting and just be an industrialist.  The story is rather short, which is my only real complaint.\n\nThis game does take a while to learn, both the economy, and the mechanics of space flight to get the edge you need to succeed.  Many people complain about not having a mouse.  That's like saying you want a spoon to eat spaghetti!  Seriously, the mouse is just not as efficient here.  You need a keyboard to navigate the menus and a joystick to fly.  I chain my commands together so fast now I don't even have time to see what the options are anymore, I've memorized them.  Anyone with a mouse would be much slower navigating the menus.  Take a ship, "C" for command, "1" for navigation, "2" for dock, "enter" to select the current system, arrow down a certain number of times to select the destination, and hit enter to submit the command.  That is five different screens you need to select an option from for this one command.  And you may need to do this ten times in a row.  A mouse does not work with this interface well, but if you wanted to completely redesign the interface I am sure you could make a mouse just as efficient.  X3 has tried it, but it doesn't work for me.","November 30, 2014","true","57.5"," 16 of 22 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","16","22","0","2"

That is: a game you can play for maybe a lifetime :-0, since familiarizing with one of them will get you into the other franchise games, each with hundred of gameplay hours. So for the ones which are fans of the genre interested on endless singleplayer gaming where you can do pretty much anything ('trade, think, explore, combat') a sure bet for infinite space wandering (just remember once in a while you do have a real life to take care of!). To sum it up: takes some time to learn, entry cost for lifetime spacefaring. Don't get lost in space!

So you maybe better trying X-Beyond The Frontier first, in order to avoid struggling to climb up the steep learning curve, for this game. The best tip is to avoid Kha'ak M3s and M2 class ships as well as Xenon M2 ships, as those nasties can tear your ship into scrap metal in seconds.\n\nIf you already mastered X-BTF and X-Tension, then you maybe best to use Money Cheat as trying to rebuild your Space Empire is time consuming. Trust me, you best off using Money Cheat - just enough for a Argon M3 equiped with as much it can carry and the best shields & lasers.

Although I have newer X games, I often get back to this one, because it has it's unique and remarkable atmosphere that no other X game has. It's by far one of the deepest and games I've ever played and if you also love space and strategy games, there's a high chance you'll quickly get addicted into this one. If you want to try the X series, which is the best modern space simulator nowadays, don't care so much about the story (in case you don't care starting with a bit old X1) and don't want to spend many hours of learning from the community tutorials, start right here with X2. It has a nice ingame tutorial, unlike X3 games.\n\nThe trade-fight-build-think motto quite sums it up. The game itself consists of huge universe which is divided into sectors, between which you fly by gates or jump drive. At almost all sectors there are stations at which you can land and buy/sell wares on. A factory produces weapon components which a ray emitter factory need, and will buy energy or ore from you. AI-controlled freight ships fly between those stations, across the whole universe, and search for good trades. The more ammounts of some ware a station needs, the lower the price, and so it dynamically changes and creates a complex, working economy system, which the universe relies on. You attack a ship transporting energy to a station, the station won't receive what it needs in time, it won't be able to produce the required ammounts of products, and it's sales will go down. So all your actions have their consequences and the universe feels "living" because of this, as you see all those ships traveling around you, everywhere in the universe (you should have a decent processor for this btw).\n\nYou can also make money by fighting pirates, which fly around and randomly attack other ships. If you destroy their local station, you will significantly reduce the ammount of them, in the specified area. Or if you want, become one of them and smuggle space weed on your own risk.If you choose the trade route, you can build stations and create a huge, prosperating empire. Assign freight ships to them, give them commands to work autonomously, also the same to defense ships. Then you can afford those huge capital ships which you can fly by yourself, from the bridge. The commanding console system gives you a huge power if you learn how to use it, especially if you love automatisation and to see how money quickly flow into your account!\n\nThe story is in some parts a bit frustrating and hard. Newbies find it hard to even dock with a station without exploding, or to get any money. But keep in mind that this game needs a lot of time to learn, to fully enjoy it. If you're starting with only a light fighter you can usually only attack the same classes or only one-class higher from you (and not in formation) ships, if you're good enough. I recommend to start by fighting light pirates, trading wares between stations, and do many side missions. But the real fun starts when you build at least 10 factories and get yourself a nice corvette with turrets and go exploring on your own ;)","August 19, 2012","true","51.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

You have to work your *** off to afford new ships;  following the story doesn't give you a free lunch.. But it's worth it, because you earn your own rags-to-riches story.\n\nEventually you can afford to start building your own factories and security forces, and you find the gameplay changes from doing gruntwork trading, to becoming the CEO of your own coorporation.\n\nAlthough it has a STEEP learning curve, half the game is played in the menu screens, and certain gameplay elements could use extra depth;   it still delivers an overall atmosphere and style of sandbox gameplay that I keep coming back to and haven't found anywhere else.\n\n7 / 10","May 13, 2013","true","544.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like 4 hours worth of figuring out all the buttons cuz it uses nearly every key on the board. Most of them are shortcuts however, and aren't strictly needed. Don't let that turn you off though, cuz if you can get through those first few hours, you will have one of the best space-sim strategies I've ever played. Its open world, so although you are given a main mission, you can spend hours just exploring, trading, gaining resouces, building stations, and going on side missions. The world is unique and indepth. Your ship's computer will tell you "facts" about nearly every single item you look at, and there are "news broadcasts" to be read at all the stations about whats happening in the world around you. Its amazing, and something no space-sim dork should be without!","April 29, 2012","true","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","3"

At this point the original X: Beyond the Frontier is pretty old and probably not worth playing to someone new to the franchise.\n\nThe storyline for this game isn't that long, or particularly enthralling, but X's real draw is it's sandbox style outlook to economic empire-building in space.  It's a ton of fun if you're into that kind of thing, and the dogfighting can be a blast too.  The dynamic economy is fun to engage with, and it's not very difficult to carve out a niche for yourself and build towards being the galactic mogul you want to be.  It's a complex game, but not intimidatingly so, and once the learning curve is done with it's pretty rewarding.\n\nDon't expect it to be primarily an action game though, and don't expect to be wowed by the plot.

I remember buying this game for $5 and having it sit around in my library for awhile without touching it. I've always heard good things about the X series and thought to give it a whirl. And when I did... phew.\n\nOverall\n8/10\n\nThe Good\nOverall, this game is about as solid of an economic simulator that you will ever find. The sheer size of the galaxy with all of the stations, sectors, and ships is truely impressive. The premise of making money is buy-low and sell-high. However, this is a little tedious at first. With only one ship that is a bit dated it can take awhile to get the ball rolling but once you do this game shines. I've only put 40 hours in (taking a break to move on to X3) and I have about 50 ships along with about 15 stations. By carefully placing factories and making a few traders you can easily exploit holes in the in-game economy (which are intentional). As far as an economic simulator this game ranks among the best.\n\nThere is a great community behind the X series. If you ever have a question there is always a forum post to consult about figuring it out. Plus people have really gone crazy with modifying the game and there are a ton of add-ons that you can play around with. I haven't just because I wanted a normal playthrough my first time.\n\nThe Average\nCombat isn't exactly the strong point in this game. Don't expect to build up massive fleets of ships like in a RTS until very late in the game. And even then, managing a huge combat fleet can be tedious. The one downfall of the combat system is that you cannot create fleets (at least I don't know how to) and this means you have to individually order all of your ships to move from place to place and attack. Despite this, I would say the combat on 1-on-1 ship battles is quite good. Thanks to a HUD it's a little easier than you would think to blow up or capture a few pirate ships. Overall, if you are looking for a game focused on combat, try elsewhere. Or at least wait until you get a Capital Ship ;)\n\nAs far as the technical side of things graphics are not bad for a game this old. The scaling is a little off and you'll wonder why a scout ship isn't the size of an ant next to a carrier trust me. The best visuals are the nebulas by far. Just fly through one and be amazed.\n\nThe Bad\nWell the main thing to understand about this game is that it really really really really takes a ton of fortitude. You will not have a massive empire after 20 hours (if someone knows how to get one please let me know?). You will not have billions and billions in the bank after 20 hours. Heck 20 hours was about the point when I started opening up a few factories. This game will be an absolute grind from start to finish simply because there isn't a whole lot of self-automation. Micro-managing a fleet of just 50 ships and like 2 dozen factories is super tedious. So just imagine after I play another 40 hours. So please. UNDERSTAND. This game isn't for the feint of heart. That being said, if you are a hardcore gamer than this game is right up your alley.\n\nThe other major flaw is this is somewhat of a sandbox game. Well there are objectives and a story line but they are average in that regard. How you feel about this game is determined by what you want to accomplish. For me, I want to eventually get to a few billion credits and slowly sweep everyone off the map. So I don't mind watching my ships slowly move from place to place and for my bank account to slowly grow.\n\nThe Verdict\nAbsolutely buy this game if you are looking for one of the best economic simulators. Do not buy if you want to blow up everything in sight (at least in the beginning) or if you lack patience.\n\nCheers!","March 2, 2015","true","42.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Right into the intro, I tried my best to not acknowledge it, but it just wasn't possible. While this is often excuseable with decent gameplay, I couldn't even get into the gameplay because the controls are difficult as hell to understand. They don't even give you a tutorial, they just throw you right into the game. It took me at least 15 minutes to find the right button just to pull up the instructions menu, and even then I still couldn't pilot the vehicle. While perhaps this game may have decent gameplay, the controls are VERY complicated which makes it VERY unplayable. I personally just didn't have the patience for it, so I stopped there, which is why I have such little time logged. I doubt even an actual pilot could understand the controls presented here.\n\nDo yourself a favor and save some cash, this game really isn't worth it unless you have decades to waste trying to figure out how to play.","May 23","false","0.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Thirdly, the main character has no voice. Fourth, The conversation options always lead to the same choice for you. Fifth, the ship controls are the wost I've ever seen. They are inverted for the Y axis but not X. Pressing  W makes the ship do a roll to the left and there is no option to roll right. A and D controll the speed. The list goes on and on. Lastly, the menu has very minimal mouse support.You controll the thing you want with the mouse wheel and click to select.

It's not only problem with the graphic which feels more like minecraft, but also speech is odd and does not really connect to characters. Not to mention how boring actors are in their litteraly reading of dialogu. Characters look like they are yawning, while their voices echo later.\n\nGUI looks so boring and unfriendly that I just don't feel motivated to explore prices or markets. Now I like economy games, but considering how time is valuable, fact that X2 requires a lot of time to get into, it feels like waste of time. I will just move along to X3 and try newer game.

I've spent maybe 20 game hours trying to figure out how to make a freaking buck. I've come through thanks to guides, and ego soft forums.\n\nOutside of common exploits, that all the guides point you to, the gameplay at the beginning seems tedious at best - you make close to nothing, and everything you can do requires hundreds of thousands of credits invested.\n\nOnce you get going it starts to get fun, exciting and satisfying, though.\n\nI'm kinda new to sims, and never had much fun with trading games. Maybe I matured, or maybe everything else got old (it did, God help me, it did), but this game was really refreshing once I got past the 20hr long humiliating torment that the quest system in x2 is.\n\nApproach with caution as I recommend it being totally new to the genre (not counting EVE online I mostly pvped in).\n\nPS - I've been playing for a week, and still haven't been able to afford a combat ready ship.\n\n","May 26, 2015","true","85.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think X2 is one of the most beautiful games of its day and contains full-body cutscenes and internal docking. I even think many of the ships look better, even though the scales are horribly skewed. At this price, it's certainly worth a playthrough or two.","October 6, 2012","true","77.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However as it tries to do both don't expect it to be outstanding at either.\n\nThe gameplay is solid, there are some clever mechanics (capturing Xenon ships is both a challenge and very rewarding)  and there is enough to keep you occupied after the main story if you want to become a production mogul. It does tend to become very time consuming and repetitive with only minor progress though when you are trying to buy a capital ship.\n\nI do recommend this game but keep in mind that it won't be for everyone!","June 3","true","36.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
