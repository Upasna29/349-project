It spent a couple of years sitting in my backlog, consistently ignored.  My eyes scanned right past it a hundred times as I looked for new games to play, and every time I ultimately selected something that was a little more recognizable. Then one day, finally, I noticed it and gave it a try. And I am ecstatic that I did. I had a blast playing through the campaign. Binary Domain may not be a GOTY-worthy masterpiece, but it certainly deserves more recognition than it receives. Any advocate of the genre and/or fan of good sci-fi would be wise to give this game some consideration.\n\nThere are a number of well-executed features in Binary Domain, but I would argue the most prominent is the excellent sci-fi narrative. The setting offers an interesting conceptualization of a possible future for Earth that touches on the classic themes of AI progression, eugenics, and the distribution of wealth. The actual storyline follows a squad of stereotypical shooter-game heroes as they kick ♥♥♥ and take names all the way to victory. A lot of it is cliché at the core, but it is executed well. Fun cutscenes and excellent pacing to the narrative bring it all together to really keep your interest as you play through the campaign.\n\nBut if all you wanted was a good story you could just watch a movie, so why bother with Binary Domain? Well, there are also several appealing aspects intrinsic to the gameplay. One cool feature is the voice-recognition system that allows you to use your headset to respond to your teammates’ inquiries. It is gimmicky, and totally optional, but I thought it added some welcome flavor to the game. There is also a companion trust system which will reward you for performing well in firefights. Even headshots have a little twist in this game, as they will confuse your robot enemies into attacking their own kin.  Additionally, boss fights, monotony-breaking vehicle segments, and evolving enemy weaponry keep the gameplay fresh and fun throughout the campaign. It is an enjoyable gameplay experience overall.\n\nOf course, there are some flaws. The concept of using one button for: jump, take cover, break cover, switch cover, and sprint has been causing annoying moments since it was introduced… and it will likely cause a few during a playthrough of Binary Domain. Also if you are interested in maximizing trust with your companions, you’ll probably incur a few head-shaking-moments when they run into your line of fire and promptly lower their trust in you. But these, and other, slight annoyances are just that: slight. They won’t sour the overall experience in any substantial way, but they will pop up from time to time.\n\nBinary Domain also has a few auxiliary multiplayer modes. Although, the Versus Mode can safely be considered defunct. Six players are needed to even start a match, so unless you have the patience to orchestrate a meet-up, you won’t be playing it. There is also Invasion Mode which is a co-op horde mode. You can actually play it solo, but you most likely won’t get far. With a friend or two: it can be fun, but nothing too outstanding. The campaign is definitely where Binary Domain shines brightest, so you can just as well ignore the multiplayer modes entirely if you don’t mind leaving behind a few achievements.\n\nSo if you enjoy the genre, good single-player campaigns, and strong narratives then you will probably enjoy Binary Domain. It is a good game; perhaps not top-shelf premium, but good.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","January 24","true","12.8"," 160 of 176 people (91%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","91","160","176","6","5"

There was evidently a lot of heart and soul put into this, and its a very confident third-person shooter, albeit it doesn't really do anything new. It has good mechanics and interesting enemies, good music, pretty good looking, and a surprisingly interesting, sometimes hammy, but enjoyable story with characters you end up liking and caring about. There's also some cool minor choices you make with the story that are pretty fun to experiment with, and even the gameplay distractions that change the pace (such as sliding down a water pipe or riding a cart) are pretty well done and fun! If you even just have a passing interest in team-based third-person shooters, this game is worth your time, and again, a complete steal when its on sale.","January 13, 2014","true","21.2"," 107 of 118 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","107","118","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freshVeggie/recommended/203750/","freshVeggie","freshVeggie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freshVeggie/","705 products in account","My Binary Domain Impressions\n\nStory:\nIn the future mankind couldn't stop global warming which lead to catastrophic rises in sea levels. Huge landmasses have been flooded and many died. Gigantic walls were built to fend off the oceans. Only robots could achieve this colossal task. Having proven themselves robots are now present everywhere in society. This led two corporations to huge success, the American Bergen and Japanese Amada.\nAs a result politicians have put restrictive laws into R&D of life-like robots indistinguishable from humans, "Hollow Children". You play as a member of a RUST crew whose job it is to go after violations against these laws.\nWhen a Hollow Child not even knowing it is non-human is found, you and a multinational team are sent covertly to Japan to find evidence against the Amada corporation.\n\nGameplay:\nBinary Domain is a fairly standard third-person-shooter with many inventive systems. Each of your crew members has a "trust meter". This will either fill or decrease upon your choices during dialogue and whether you protect them during combat. Another neat idea is the implementation of voice-enabled commands. I didn't use a mic so I had to use pre-config commands via button press. These can go from combat orders like "Give me cover fire" up to opinions on your crews mood and comments on events unfolding in the story.\n\nAs a TPS shooting is the main focus. And boy does it shine. Movement is adequately quick with dedicated "dodge" moves. Weapon variety is standard with a nice selection of grenades. Experience points are used to upgrade your weapon and character stats. Don't expect anything too deep though. It is held enjoyably simple.\nYour arsenal will get its fair share of use against the many robots you will be facing in the ~8 hour campaign. To my big surprise devs managed to turn a cliche enemy like robots into one of the most enjoyable adversaries in a long time. They are not stupid! They will take cover, pop out to shoot, dodge attacks and be formidable opponents. Prepare to take cover a lot as rushing into combat will get you killed fast.  But keep calm as disposing robots is as fun as it can get. Bullets stagger them with very good hit animations while clusters of their outer shell is shred flying all around the screen. Good placed shoots will sever limbs, send legs and arms flying around. Don't loose your focus though as these robots will continue pursuing you even without any legs. Headshots will turn robots into shooting sprees hitting their robot brethren, so keep your aim steady! Combat is the shining beacon among all other greatness. From the clean and futuristic landscapes with huge scope to the many and frequent set pieces which never outstay their welcome. Speaking of, levels are diverse while still retaining general tone of futuristic Tokyo. Each of them ends with a boss. Varying in fun while all of them can make quick business of you. Running from cover to cover, commanding your teammates at the right moment and using appropriate weapons will make them a challenge but never unfair.\n\nVerdict:\nNot having heard much from Binary Domain previously the screenshots and game banner did paint a very mediocre image. I'm glad I still gave the game a try as it became one of my most beloved TPS of recent years. It's polished with good voice acting, making me care about my teammates. The theme of robots and trans-humanism are interesting and were nicely woven into the story. Unforeseen twists kept me at the edge of my seat and I genuinely cared about the events that unfold. A very satisfying game which I hope gets a sequel.","August 27, 2015","true","10.7"," 90 of 97 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","90","97","0","1"

The graphics are very nice for the year it came out, the sound is crisp and clean to the weapons and the explosions they admit from. The music is done nicely and fits every zone, boss encounter, or other elements within the game. The dialogue is well done and has some cliché moments, but the acting is likable with emotions behind their voice acting (not bland or dull from what I could tell).\n\nThe upgrade system consists of weapon and body enhancements that are given to you and your teammates via purchases from ATM stores. These upgrades can give extra life, additional damage to your weapons (theirs included), extra slots for grenades/medkits and nanomachines that give additional skills that help you by giving you faster reload times, additional health, defense, etc.  This is done for you and all your teammates that you gather along the way through the campaign.\n\nThe story is compelling, fun, and entertaining. It even gives some nice ‘romance’ time too. I won’t give any spoilers as the story has some plot twists and it really makes you think who the villain is majority of the game and then… PLOT TWIST! I really enjoyed the story and the dialogue between you and your teammates based on your decisions throughout the game. You also get a favoritism system with your teammates that will add additional dialogue into the game and possibly add some more plot twists at the end. I really found this system to my liking as you could change the ending based on your actions with your fellow teammates (shooting them, picking ‘bad’ dialogue options, etc. will decrease the favoritism).\n\nI enjoy the combat system. It proved a cover system, the enemy AI that can actually hit their mark and boss fights that were different from their smaller counterparts and unique to other bosses that wanted to smash you into a pulp. Every mission was different from the last; whether it was driving on the highway and blowing up your enemies, sniping from the rooftops, or running in a sewage system with creepy-crawlies – every location was unique and entertaining.\n\nI can’t find a lot of flaws with this title, but the major one that stood out was the Voice Recognition system that was implemented with this title. I’m using a Logitech G35 headset and at times I would YELL at the microphone to get a command through. I had all the sensitivities on high (through game and the G35 settings) and it would still require me yelling at times or commands that I never initially said. They did give a lot of options for the game to recognize when the game COULD hear you. You could also call your teammates slur words if you were displeased with them through the system – a nice touch. Another note, your teammates at times will RUN in front of you gunfire and get upset at you for shooting them. It doesn’t happen a lot, but be prepared when it does happen (they don’t lose a lot of favoritism, but a nice slap upside their head wouldn’t hurt either)!\n\nHowever, I didn’t play multiplayer so I can’t give a rating on how that experience is. The multiplayer is dead, but it might have its moments where people get together through the Steam forums to set something up. As far as anything else, this game is a hidden gem. I really enjoyed this game. It was a unique experience with the setting and story that the developers provided. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone who likes robots, futuristic titles, shooters, and/or squad based games.\n","October 17, 2015","true","11.6"," 84 of 92 people (91%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","91","84","92","7","5"

Binary Domain is an interesting game not olnly from the different type of enemies you are used to shoot but also for the combination of action, humour and storytelling. The Story kept me interested until the very end.If you were one of those players that would get bored for the constant shooting then in my case, I just found new ways to make it more fun. By shooting the robots in head they will turn against each other. If you add that with shooting others in the feet, forcing them to crawl then you have an interesting combination of events to watch. The city is filled with amazing little details, something you might miss if you are just rushing from point A to point B. But you shouldn't. The bright lights in the city at night are something your eyes will be pleased to see and the visuals are quite good too.\n\nThe characters are very distinctive from each other putting Big Bo among the favourites. There's rivalry, sarcasm, humour and even... romance. There are a few plot twists here and there to make the story more compelling and interesting which pleased me until the very end. During the game you are able to talk to your team mates using your own voice (which I didn't because I do not have a Microphone on my PC yet) or simply by using the controller. By doing so, you will offer tactical advice to them but also if they request healing or suggest a new tactic you are free to agree or disagree with them.\n\nIt might not be a title that many people have the chance to play it, and those that had it share different opinions about the game, however I found to be a nice shooting adventure from start to finish. There's nothing over the top or extremely remarkable but not all games require to be such experience. Some, like Binary Domain just want to tell a story while mixing a bit of storytelling and bullets, lot's of them, in fact.\n\nThere might be more cut scenes that one person who is used to play FPS and TPS would find but to me this was never a problem, in fact, I believe it was balanced between having a lot of things to point and shoot during tense moments, and then, a little bit of story, controversy or plot twist via cut scenes. I like to have both of these in my games but again, many may find it tiresome if all you want is too shoot some robots in their shiny metal ***.\n\nIn the end I think it's important to reflect if we are not going too far with our discoveries in advanced robotic technology. I know that it is the year of 2080 and the world most progress but, at what cost..? Paraphrasing Albert Einstein "I fear the day that technology will surpass our human interaction." In Binary Domain, that day may have happened already...","March 11, 2014","true","10.2"," 82 of 96 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","82","96","0","2"

But the reality is, that this specific shooter has very interesting features that the others don't have. Basically those would be:\n\nA truth system with allies, with the possibility to choose between teammates.\nUnique enemies (just robots all the game, which its great). It feels a lot like Vanquish.\nA very interesting story. Yes, it really has a nice story. Who could have though something like that with a shooter?\nA lot of cinematics, some very lenghty ones. I don't know but it feels like a Hideo Hojima game sometimes.\n\nAll of this, maybe because the game was made by a japanese studio. So yeah, it's another shooter, but a very interesting one and unique. As I said, it remembers a lot to Vanquish, and obviously, Vanquish is better, but since there is no Vanquish on PC, this alternative is excellent, and should feel kinda enough for the ones that probably never gonna have the chance to play it.\n\nThe only problem that I really found with this game, was with issuing orders with your voice thorugh a mic. I'm just gonna say that it's better to ignore that feature and keep issuing orders like old school times, with Keyboard/Mouse or a Controller. You don't really need to issue orders with your voice, it's not necessary, and the game is still very enjoyable without that.","September 28, 2014","true","25.7"," 53 of 57 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","53","57","2","0"

Great titles like this one remain in the shadows while we make rich companies releasing mediocre, badly optimized, unfinished products. We ♥♥♥♥♥ about titles with non-existing story modes, no single player content, dlc, microtransactions, but at the same time we only notice the real gems when we get them for a couple of euros ages after their release. People refusing to pay for amazing games like this one and Spec Ops: The Line, when at the same time paying tens maybe hundreds of euros for unecessary costumes or crappy hats and knives.\n\nAlmost every part of Binary Domain is great. The story is interesting, the pacing is spot on, the characters and their interactions are memorable, it has multiple endings, shooting robots is a blast, the bosses are huge and fun to deal with, the AI is pretty solid for the most part, the length of the story mode is decent (around 10 hours), there is replayability with playing levels with different members or seeing the different conclusions of the story. Again, what else to you want from a third person shooter?\n\nDoes it have any flaws? Well, the advertised use of the mic to issue orders doesn't work very well, but this is barely an issue since you can assign the orders to button inputs. Dialogues can be a bit hammy at times. A couple of boss battles drag a bit. But for the most part it's just nitpicking.\n\nAgain the reason I wrote this review is because I wanted to express how sad it is that promising ips will never see a new release simply because of the way we, the gamers, shaped the modern gaming industry. As much as a few people ♥♥♥♥♥ about microtransactions, short campaigns, but storylines, focus on multiplayer, at the end of the day this is what the majority out there wants. Of course there are exceptions, mostly action rpgs but not every single player title should need a 100 hour length to worth the cost of admission.","May 2","true","42.7"," 47 of 54 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","47","54","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/recommended/203750/","peterhollo","CorvusCorax","http://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhollo/","533 products in account","Upon checking the metacritic score for this game - and most notably the aggregate score that is the result of the user feedback and not journalism - I am very sad to see that this is a very underrated video game.\n\nSet towards the end of the 21st century Binary Domain is the story of two competing corporations - one blames the other one for having stolen its robotics technology. This is a world where robotics is very important as robots represent manual labour force. While the technology is highly advanced under no circumstances should anyone create an A.I. that looks and (in terms of behaviour) resembles a human being. These so-called "Hollow Children" are banned and a new Geneva convention is held to make sure the law states the same.\n\nNow, the CEO of Bergen, an American company leading on this field, is attacked by a "Hollow Child" so who else to blame but its Japanese counterpart called Amada? A so-called Rust Crew is sent to Japan to deal with the situation - this is a specialised unit for such cases when this particular clause is broken.\n\nThroughout 6 chapters and a roughly 10-hour long campaign we'll control Dan and his squad who try to find evidence for Amada's illegal research and of course to apprehend the man behind all this. It is a TPS with fast-paced action and between the various chapters we can pick the two extra squad members accompanying Dan - they do not differ very much, though: each member has a different weapon but Dan's assault rifle is the best for pretty much every scenario.\n\nNow, the game has tons of cutscenes and a lot of extremely funny dialogues. This is pretty much the funniest action game I have played in recent years. Dan and Bo's friendship (or more like "broship") is fun to watch and each member of the team comes from a different nation just to play with certain stereotypes.\n\nLocales vary in accordance with the story and occasionally we are met with boss battles where the robots are, of course, huge. Some finesse is required to eliminate them and for some reason many of them take after certain animals. We are to kill a giant spider in the middle of a city, avoid the fists of an angry gorilla, escape the teeth of a giant snake that runs on one wheel and battle an enraged dog on a rooftop. All these coupled with the one-liners of Dan and his comrades results in a memorable experience.\n\nAs for graphics: the way the robots lose their parts is one of the best I have seen in games. It is just gratifying to see all the metallic parts fly off of their body and their reaction to the destroyed limbs is just super: those without legs start crawling towards you. The ones that  lose one of their arms immediately grab their pistol; after all, using assault rifles requires two hands. Headshots, instead of immediately killing enemies, make them malfunction and instead of coming towards you they turn against their fellow terminators. Also, the way these so-called hollow children look like - with their skin partially peeled off of their face revealing the metal skull underneath - is just stunning.\n\nThere are two aspects of the game I could not experience. Multiplayer, as usually in these games, is there just to add to the longevity of the game so it being 3 years old no-one played these modes any more. The game requires you (Dan) to communicate with team members and for that it incorporates a voice recognition technology. It is said to be very good and also that it recognises at least half a dozen languages - I stuck to the good old dialogue menu / response select solution for time saving purposes.\n\nThis game I purchased years ago while it was on discount - I did not play it for a long time and I am so glad I took the time to see it through. This is one of those gems that receive an average feedback while it represents so much more. I wish they had ditched multiplayer in favour of cooperative gameplay. I hope SEGA will make a sequel to this game, though.","October 5, 2015","true","8.4"," 47 of 58 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","47","58","3","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/203750/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2003 products in account","I was actually really surprised by Binary Domain, I was expecting it to be another of those mediocre third person shooters but I was wrong. From the get go you are presented with a cutscene that summarizes the plot for you and after a few minutes you get your hands on some real combat.\n\nThe shooting is probably one of the most satisfying in a third person shooter, everytime you score a hit on an enemy you see little pieces of metal flying, in case you don't know you're fighting robots. The aiming is pretty decent and smooth if you use the mouse and you can also turn on/off aim assist if you're playing with a controller.\n\nThe storyline and the writing was actually one of the things that surprised me the most, Binary Domain takes place in 2074 and you're part of a Rust Crew, which is a squad that belongs to the IRTA, a special unit that hunts down those who break the laws stated in the New Geneva Convention and you're sent to Japan to investigate Amada Corporation, the leading company in robotics in Japan, due to suspicion of producing "Hollow Children", or in other words, robots that look like humans, or have human skin.\n\nThroughout the game you'll meet different characters in which upon reaching a certain point of the level you'll be asked to choose 2 of them to take with you further into the leve. The dialogue plays a huge roll on the game and every now and then, when someone asks you a question you can answer by from a different set of dialogue choices, but what actually is pretty nice is that you can answer using your microphone. I actually had alot of trouble doing that so later on I just switched to keyboard controls which made it alot easier. It's not just during dialogue that you can use this system but also during combat, to issue orders to your squad mates.\n\nNow, both the dialogue, the friendly fire during combat and certain actions you take will affect your teammates trust on you and trust actually plays a big role because if your teammates don't trust you, they are likely to not obey your orders. The character development is also something I really liked, it reminded me of Spec Ops The Line to some extent. Later on the game, characters that didn't trusted you and hated you at the beginning will now be your friends, not just teammates. There's some plot twists throughout the entire game and I certainly think those are there for good measure. Certainly the world design and the environments you play on are not really that varied, ranging from slum streets, to industrial underground facilities and corporation buildings, they are not that really interesting. However, the surface areas on Upper Tokyo are really nice to look at.\n\nThe enemy variety in the game was actually something I found really interesting. There's all kind of robots, humanoid robots, scorpion robots, flying robots, huge motorcycle riding robots, robot trucks, robot cars, robot spiders, there's all kind of robots for every tastes and likes . The weapon variety is actually not that great and I think they should have come up with some other interesting weaponry. Your available arsenal consists of a SMG, 3 or so Assault Rifles, a LMG, a Sniper Rifle, a Stinger Missile Launcher, a Minigun and I think that's pretty much it, still, this didn't kept me from enjoying the combat, which as I already mentioned, is really satisfying, just blasting your way through hordes of robots. Also, depending on how you kill your enemies (headshot, one shot etc) you'll receive credits which then can be used at a shop to buy ammo, medkits or nanomachines (which work as some kind of passive perk system) or even upgrade your main weapon or your teammates.\n\nThere's alot of great and good humour in Binary Domain and some of it comes from dirty jokes during cutscenes or dialogue which most of the times comes to "calm" things down. The best aspect about Binary Domain for me was its approach on ethical and moral standards and dilemmas. Is it right to give "life" to a robot, in the way that it haves feelings and emotions? Should we consider a robot with emotions and feelings a robot, considering it has self awareness? Of course this is pure sci-fi but it kinda makes you wonder.\n\nVerdict\nBinary Domain looks great and it ran surprisingly well on my low end PC. It also has a kickass soundtrack and the entire game is a joy to play and to witness. If you haven't picked this one up already, please do it, I'm eagerly waiting for a sequel, and so should you.","March 3, 2014","true","10.8"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","33","39","0","6"

But holy ♥♥♥♥ after the prologue it becomes on of the best TPS I've ever played.\n\nWords cannot describe the gameplay. Shooting is far more than good, every bullet you fire has a satisfying feel to them, especially the pistol, every bullet peels off their skin, the recoil of the gun, the sound of the gun add to the overall feel of the guns, I highly recommend you "play" with the robots before actually putting them out of their misery my favorite method is decapitating the heads, watch them attack their allies (They attack their allies if you decapitate them) and then whip their asses to death with a pistol (literally!). I highly recommend you upgrade your weapons as soon as you can, a fully upgraded assault rifle would leave Sonic the Hedgehog wishing he was THAT fast.\n\nStory is also pretty good, the characters all have their own charm to them and the dialogue is amusing, especially Cain (a French robot that aids you in the battle later on). There are dialogue choices that will affect your relationship to your party members, but rest assured these are not HUGE assets to your reputation with your party members.\n\nSoundtrack isn't amazing, but it does the job well. None of the songs are bad, but none of them are amazing. One or two tracks stand out, but that's about it.\n\nIf you like shooting things this game is a must have, especially if you have a fetish for robots, even better if you have a fetish for robot-gore.\n\n\n","February 28, 2014","true","12.3"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","31","38","0","1"

Now that I have recently beaten it for the  backlog's sake, I can confirm that this was a really really fun game.\n\nBinary Domain is a third person shooter set in Japan in which you are a soldier on a covert op and you get to kill robots. There is more of a story, but for me, I just like the fact that I am in futuristic Tokyo and I get to shoot lots and lots of robots. You get to team up with a memorable cast of characters and while you don't get lots of backstory, you definitely will form bonds with them. There is a trust system in which how you handle yourself in combat and in various dialogs will effect how much your comrades trust you, and ultimately, which ending you'll get. Oh yes, there are two endings.\n\nThe look of this game is great. I never had any problems with lag and glitches. The voice acting was well done, but some of the dialog was repetitive, especially during combat. The music and sounds are great in keeping up with the non-stop action of the game. While you are mostly fighting, there are pop up scenarios that almost feel like mini-games throughout the campaign, such as escape scenarios and car chases. The game really has an arcade kind of feel at times, and it helps keep it fun not stressful.\n\nThe only negative are the controls. Sometimes the controls are not clear. There were many times when I was told to press "M". Well, after looking at an online guide, I found out the game meant "mouse", not the "M" on the keyboard. There are multiple forums on the internet asking for help in various situations due to poor control layout, especially in timed scenarios.\n\nI'm really glad that I got this game. Now that I know how fun it is, I would definitely recommend it at full price. It's fun, has an entertaining story, cool characters, and a great setting. There is definite replayability since different comrades leads to different ends. I know at least another playthrough is definitely in the future.","May 30","true","21.3"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","1"

It is an absolutely gorgeous game - great animation, lighting and textures - that wastes all that artistry on some of the least interesting locales: slums, garages, sewers. It has some fun firefights that inevitably over-stay their welcome. The game has a wide variety of enemy types who still, in the end, fail to distinguish themselves from one another. The story and characters touch a lot of interesting points but are inanely combined in a way that only the Japanese can manage.\n\nBasically, Binary Domain is the closest you can get to an interactive anime movie. It feels very Japanese, which I suppose is a good thing if you are otaku but lacks the solidity and seriousness that Western gamers expect. In fact, the gameplay itself feels as if the developers at Sega intended to create a modern, western-style FPS without quite understanding why people found them so appealing. Thus, too-frequent cut-scenes interrupt the action, enemies are often invulnerable until certain scripted sequences play and there's a disturbing reliance on the old "shoot the glowing orange weak-spot" mechanic that most FPS developers left to rot ten years ago. Its almost worth it for the artistry of its graphics and animations, but the gameplay was forgettable at best.","November 25, 2013","true","18.8"," 36 of 50 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","36","50","0","0"

WHAT?! Okay, first off, Binary Domain's story starts off pretty standard, Japan turns out to be producing human-like robots which violates the law, and it's your job to find proof and bring the distrubutor to justice, although along the way there are a LOT of twists and turns. It makes you think of what'd happen if we DO get to that point where man and machine aren't distinguishable from one-another... As many others say it's like playing a movie. It sort of drags you in to being the badass "Survivor" that everyone loves to hate. The world itself is pretty interesting, a futuristic Neo-Tokyo style, and pretty much all your enemies are robots! Or "Scrap-heads" in this case. I've just finished the story myself, and clocked in about 12 hours of Steam time with it. I may have to go through parts of it again because there are actually multiple endings. Whew, man things get heavy. The diolouge itself is kind've mediocre, but there are some good jokes and one-liners that'll make you chuckle, and the characters don't stand out too much, but this game doesn't take itself too seriously, and it makes it better for it.\n\nGameplay: 6/10 The gameplay can be frustrating if you don't set up your controller right, turn the sensitivity down a notch, make sure your buttons are set up, and don't bother trying to use a mic, just keep it off. It may be a feature, but it's poorly innovated in this game, sorry. You can give orders just fine with the buttons. But people complaining about the gameplay probably haven't fine-tuned their settings, if you aren't lazy, you can make this game just as playable as any other TPS. I hope you like assault-rifles though, that'll be your main weapon most the time but you can switch it up. The gameplay can be a bit repetitive, though there are sections that change things up a bit. (e.g. sliding down a wall, riding on jet-skis) Often times it felt like an off-rails shooter, since it's completely linear with a few hidden things to collect if that's your thing.  The bosses are kind've interesting too, there are a few ones that switch things up from standard run n gunning, though most of them can be powered through as long as you don't take too many hits, they hit HARD! So it's a lot of evasion/cover running around trying not to get hit, while turning to aim and shoot back at the enemy. And just when I thought I haven't seen any new enemies in a while, a new type showed up to keep things a bit more interesting, it is kind of a thrill-ride wanting to know what the heck's gonna happen next, while being a part of the action to keep things moving. There are even multiple endings which are dependent on your trust levels with your teammates. Unfortunately, the online is dead, so if you're looking for the next multiplayer experience, you'd best move along.\n\nOverall: 7/10 If you like Third person shooters, even if you aren't a fan of them, but you like things like robots, Japan, technology, you'll like this game, it's a fun ride, and for 15 bucks, it'll keep you entertained more than the story of the latest COD, that's for sure.

I didn't want to play it. The first 2 hours were terrible. I was crying of boredom...\n\nIt was too repetitive, too much handholding and linear, cutting from slow walking with stupid talking that didnt do any good to the combat, fighting 3 soldiers and going back to talking and pressing buttons. First 2 chapters are painfully terrible for me. 3 is better and 4 and so on are good and evolve into even better...\n\n\nAnyways I finished Binary Domain and I can safely say it redeems itself after a while but it's still not trophy-winning. It truly is one of the best examples of "It gets better as you go along".\n\nOk into the review itself, Binary Domain is a game where you play as Adam Sandler in a robot filled world! And I can say the PC Port is outright ♥♥♥♥. Seriously, complete ♥♥♥♥. You have the "Play" and "Settings" Options before lauching the game. To configure the game: you have to pick the "Settings" option, which will freak out and the window does not seem to be compatible with my Screen Native Resolution! How come, you ask? Well, you can tweak everything fine, BUT! The Save and Quit option is absolutely out of my reach because it's behind my taskbar so I cant press it, thus I have to fullscreen the settings window and THEN it has a small part of the button that is actually clickable!\nRight now you're probably wondering: Wait, isn't that how Kane & Lynch 2 had it's options? Yes, you are correct BUT Kane & Lynch 2 also had the options in the game itself! So if the game needed tweaks you could change it without the need of quitting the actual game.\n\nBinary Domain has a nice set of options, but the performance itself is decent and decent only! So if you need to tweak minor stuff, you have to quit the game, tweak it, boot it up, test it, if it's poor still, you have to exit, rinse and repeat.\n\nIt feels like the PC version of the game is a massive afterthought, which is sad.\n\n\nThe visuals themselves aren't bad though, particles effects are really well done, facial animation are a bit stiff but get the job done. Overall texture quality is decent as well.\nRegarding the visuals: THIS GAME HAS TOO MANY CUTSCENES! Some of them are completely useless and they weren't needed at all. So, it happens that I skipped some, *clicks skip* - *new cutscene appears* - *clicks skip* - *New... ok you get the point. If my memory doesn't fail me, the game can have 4 CUTSCENES IN A ROW!\nI swear the game could have half those cutscenes without hindering the game itself at all!\n\nThat being said, I must say the cutscenes are quite cliché but look genuinely good and some of the best cutscenes I could see in a video game. The action/story-important cutscenes, not the useless ones, those are boring and, again, useless!\n\nVoice acting is rather cliché, but it's still cool as the game has a nice B-Movie feel with plenty of jokes and it works really well imo!\n\nWhile the voice acting is simple, I can say Sandler's voice acting is actually REALLY GOOD! His facial animations and voice overs in cutscenes are really well done. The rest is a bit less memorable but still good overall. (Troy Baker plays Charlie in the game, I swear to God when I saw that in the credits, I was like "lolwut...").\n\nThe game has that classic japanese poses and influence for sure. Almost everytime a cutscene ends, Adam makes that soldier pose with a badass face and then the shooting starts!\n\nCombat: Adam's main rifle (which you cannot switch for another gun, it stick with you the WHOLE Game) is awesome! It feels great! Headshotting a robot is beyond satisfying and the secondary fire mode (Pulse Grenade Launcher-ish) is also a nice addition to the weapon. Everytime you kill an enemy you get points, more so for melee kills or headshot kills. Those point can be spent in medic kits (which dont heal you (the game has health regen), instead they revive you if you get downed), ammo or weapon upgrades for Adam's rifle or his companion's special weapon's...\n\nAI is good.\n\nMr. Sandler's moving, however, is weird. When you get down stairs or a ledge you suddely move 4 times faster while getting down the stairs, sometimes you move so fast you actually run OVER the stairs and fly across them, which is hilarious!\n\nWhen sprinting, you have trouble controlling Adam's body, which is fine except this ♥♥♥♥s up the running sequences, because  stuff's falling, you're moving and dodging, except that you aren't because while sprinting it's tricky to move sideways, this makes the running away sequences poor and boring. P.S: You will die alot in them...\n\nThe cover system works well enough so kudos for that...\n\nMy biggest problem however is purely combat related: when shot, Adam can't stand the bullets going into his 1000 pounds battle power armor, so he flinches so f*cking much it's literally unbelievable! It makes the combat stiff! I remember a little test I did, I got shot by a "boss" (not really a boss, but he had a mean-♥♥♥ sniper-rifle (those who played the game know who I'm talking about) and my character's aim literally moved 40 degrees to the right!\n\nTrust me, it's fine to have flinch, it should have, but not this much! I mean, when a regular robot shoots you, your aim goes up too much for me, making the combat a little less fun than it should. However you can get back in cover, wait and get back into aiming and shooting. But still, this annoys the hell out of me.\n\nAnother huge issue is the stuns. The protagonist gets stunned/downed for everything! a grenade explodes 5 yards away *Tries to keep balance*.\n\n*Robot clunkily bashes you with his fist* = *falls over and takes forever to get up*\n\nIt makes the pacing of the combat too stupidly slow, and this back and forth between shooting a magazine and falling over that is really annoying as for a small amount of seconds you have to stare at the computer, seeing Adam in an angel position on the floor!\n\nNext up: the quicktime events! Trust me, there aren't many at all! BUT! The first time a quick time event in particular appeared, it has arrows and 2 space bar icons. I literally was 1 minute trying to figure it out before I failed and decide to plug in my controller and do it with the controller. I then got it.\n\nMaybe I'm stupid in understanding coded messages but that was really weird to understand for me and it left me really frustrated.\n\nEnouh of this. The combat is satisfying enough to carry the whole game alongside:\n\nThe story and the philosophy behind it. I will not even mention much about the story (You go on a top secret mission to investigate a big robot-making corporate), but the philosophy behind the game is really good and well done. It gives truly special moments to question out existance as humans and who we can have walking by our sides. This robot/human interaction in society is a good touch I never expected to get into me this much nor did I expect it to be this well fleshed out by the end of the game.\n\nOne last thing too, the plot twist behind this game. I read comments before going into the final chapter and some like "Wow, plot twist was bat-sh*t insane, omg so cool*, it wasn't, I smelled the thing from miles away! Not sure if you, dear reader, will predict it too, but on my case, it disappointed me that I nailed what the twist was going to be.\n\nStory is still pretty good, nothing too special, the philosophy behind it is what makes it stand out, though...\n\nThe game's length isn't bad either, it was 7.5-8 hours long for me, but I know friends who did it in 11 hours so it depends on the player. There's also multiplayer and a co-op wave based survival.

Were you refused to be paid for a good review?\nThat's all I can think of because this game is exceptional.\n\nSimplified overview: If you enjoyed the play mechanics of Gears of War, you will enjoy this too. It feels EXACTLY like Gears of War set in the robotic future. If that interests you, I promise you won't be let down.\n\nI'll start with cons since there are so few.\n- You are one unnaturally tough S.O.B. (this gets countered by the occasional OP A.I. weapon)\n- No exploration in the game, no side missions, and I still don't know what the purpose of those little hologram diary things are that I picked up throughout the game. I'm sure it's just achievement oriented as it does nothing in game.\n- Game was just too short! I think I got about 12 hours out of it, about half of what it usually takes me to finish a FPS.\n\nPros\n+ Weapon upgrade system (slightly limited as in you will upgrade every component of your weapons by the end of the game, but you decide what to upgrade first. I would have liked to see more options)\n+ Many different bosses. Simply more than any other FPS I have played, and they all require different fighting methods to defeat them.\n+ Many different enemies. Ok it's a game about robots so it could probably get away with having the same few enemy skins throughout the game better than others, but it doesn't need to. There is a wide variety of enemy types. I guess that's the other side of robots, the designers had free range to come up with many unique "frames" for you to combat against.\n+ Surprisingly engaging story and for maybe the second time ever I didn't want to skip any of the cut scenes.\n+ Enemies take damage in a "realistic way". As in if you are shooting at a robots leg, that leg is going to fall off. The robot however will continue fighting you, adapting to it's new legless frame. It's really fun picking apart robots arm by arm, leg by leg. Hue hue hue\n\nIf you wanted a break from the more stealth oriented FPS', this will do you well. There is literally no stealth aspect in the game.\n","May 12, 2015","true","15.7"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lassepalasse/recommended/203750/","lassepalasse","Luoti-Lasse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lassepalasse/","1438 products in account","This must be the first cover based shooter in the third person I've played and learning the pretty stiff controls took its time while I was juggling between a controller and the keyboard and mouse combo trying to decide which was the right tool for the job. I finally settled on the latter because of the mouse aiming. Pulling off head (or whatever exposed robot body part) shots is pretty enjoyable once you put a couple of points in the Accuracy upgrade lane. On the other hand, this would probably work great in Big Picture, with a controller on the couch.\n\nThe game is basically a linear popcorn sci-fi action romp leaving no cliché unturned starting with the blank-slate-with-a-touch-of-A-hole main character and his big, bad muffhugger friend. The duo meet and team up with an assortment of other not-too-unpredictable characters and find themselves in a sticky situation after another with ever increasing robotic threat level. You've pretty much seen it all before but there was a surprise or two in there as well. And the fact that it's not a modern writing masterpiece, doesn't diminish the enjoyment of the setting and gameplay.\n\nThe character interaction and the voice communication system is what I had a small gripe with. Now, you don't have to use a microphone and instead you can give squad commands and choose dialogue options from a menu but I'm willing to bet that the very, very limited vocabulary Sgt. Dan Marshall reveals to the player was dictated by the voice recognition system and you are usually left guessing what he'll actually say to his team mates and what their reactions might be. Often times your buddies throw a question or a statement your way and you get a prompt to answer and the options are "No way." and "Yeah!". After a while it is pretty clear 90% of the time the "correct" answer to boost morale is the positive one but instead of agreeing to disagree on some points, Danny boy will curse out and call his team mates names you probably don't remember authorizing him to use.\n\nThe game felt quite linear but to confirm that I should probably re-play at least the first few chapters with different squad assignments. After all it seems I only finished the game with barely over 50% of the achievements. And there's a single player DLC pack to vary the campaign a little... Ah, well. A multiplayer co-op option for the story mode would be awesome but if you're in a situation flying solo, this game is recommended.\n\n(And by the way it's a SEGA game, so you'll probably forgive all the cheese and clichés with a stupid grin on your face. I did.)","August 9, 2014","true","13.5"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

For all the dislike for Japanese games, "Binary Domain" allow ​​me to survive the zingy hurricane of emotions. I I didn't have great hopes before launch and I was astonished at the quality of performance of this Japanese marvel.\nThis is adrenaline cover-based TPS with squadmates, robotic enemies, enormous robotic bosses and even moments of choice. Rapid narrative doesn't let you get bored for a second. It's impossibly to break away from "Binary Domain" :-) It reminds me of one quote from TV series: "Is it possible to eat just one pistachio from whole packet?" For me, this breathtaking adventure Japanese blockbuster has become synonymous with gamer's delight.\n+ Strengths: All is super-duper - storyline, action, characters, setting.\n- Weaknesses: irregular difficulty level, dead multiplayer. And we know little about squadmates.\n__________________________________________\nIf you really like the theme of robots, then I highly recommend you dive into this maelstrom. You don't mind QTE, cover-based third-person shooters, frequent cutscenes and a small pinch of Japanese humour? Then go for it & dare! :)\n\n\nRussian translation:Просто бесподобная игра! При всей нелюбви к японским играм, "Binary Domain" позволила мне пережить крутой ураган эмоций. Я не возлагал больших надежд перед запуском и был поражён качеством исполнения этого японского чуда.\nЭто адреналиновый TPS со стрельбой из-за укрытий, напарниками, робоврагами, гигантскими робо-боссами и даже моментами выбора. Стремительное повествование не даст вам заскучать ни на секунду. От "Binary Domain" очень сложно оторваться. Как говорилось в одном сериале: "Разве можно съесть только одну фисташку из целой упаковки?" Для меня этот захватывающий приключенческий японский боевик стал синонимом игрового восторга.\n+ Сильные стороны: всё очень круто - сюжет, экшен, персонажи, постановка.\n- Слабые стороны: скачущая сложность, multiplayer мёртв.\nПожелание: персонажам не хватает большей проработанности.\n__________________________________________\nЕсли вам по душе тематика роботов, то я настоятельно рекомендую Вам нырнуть в этот водоворот. Вы не против QTE, экшенов от третьего лица с перекатами и укрытиями, частых видеовставок и маленькой щепотки японского юмора?

The combat mechanics are pretty standard third-person shooters but it works pretty well and breaking robots down into parts is a satisfying experience. The cover system is a bit rigid but allows for plenty flexibility. Graphically the game is clean and smooth, while never spectacular there are some nice effects and it fits the setting.\n\nBossdesign was enjoyable and creative, at times the controls combined with the obvious focus the AI has for your main character where a bit of a hassle but nothing that ruined the game.\nThe story is entertaining and does keep you guessing as to how it will end, it however most issues would be solved by the invention of a metal detector. The friendship/loyalty system is basic in a good way and you do feel like it makes a difference in both the story and the interactions. Troy Baker pulling of an oddly satisfying British man only adds to this.\n\nPC controls are pretty solid, it suffers from the usual porting problems where the button icons correspondent with the actions and not with the key it's bound to. If you happen to have a gamepad plugged in this is highly recommended for the 2 sections where you man a turret.\n\nAs it looks now there won't ever be a sequel, a shame because a bit more refinement and expansion on the basics would elevate it to a superb game. All in all though I really enjoyed my time with it and it comes highly recommended.","January 17, 2015","true","10.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

In my eyes it was one of the best third-person shooters ever made.\n\nI finally got around to beating the PC version.\nMy opinion of the game hasn't changed much.\n\nFirst off, the online-play is unfortunately quite dead (due to lack of players). It's not a huge loss in the competitive aspect, but Survival mode was pretty solid.\n\nSecondly, the port does have some issues. Fixes are available (check the community hub) for most if not all of them. Still, off a fresh install with a 360 pad I had absolutely no problems. Well, aside from sometimes forgetting what button does what due to lack of controller prompts.\n\nTypically when I "re-review" a game, I either make some discovery, some hidden quality I never noticed before. Other times I find some new flaws, or determine elements that have not aged well. Game criticism is a constantly-evolving process, and even the classics are revisited. Binary Domain isn't an old game, however it is something of a rare breed. A Japanese-developed 3rd-person mecha-shooter? The only other title that immediately comes to mind is Vanquish (also a great game, fingers crossed it hits the PC soon). On the other hand, it is a 3rd-person shooter, and shares many commonalities with a huge number of games released this generation.\n\nAll that said, I believe Binary Domain is a standout title. This is one of the few shooters I would pick to represent the best of its era. Aside from featuring a fantastic campaign, with great pacing, memorable encounters, and incredible mechanics, this game also delivers on the "sure...if it's good...then why not?" stuff like plot, characters, and music. The art and sound direction are also superb. The voice-recognition? Well...that definitely doesn't hold up. It was a cute gimmick at the time of release, but little more than that.\n\nSo it's like I said, my opinion of BD hasn't changed much. Maybe I should come back to the game in a decade or so, determine if the game can be considered a true classic. Some games actually get better with age. Aspects that might appear dated, actually give the game its identity, making it something truly special. But..eh...nevermind this is just silly.\n\nBinary Domain is an excellent shooter.\nIt's usually dirt-cheap.\nHell, you probably already own it.\n\nJust play it already.","November 2, 2014","true","7.9"," 14 of 20 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","14","20","0","0"

This allows for tactical moves such as shooting their legs off to slow them down (they'll still crawl towards you and can still fire at you), or hit them once in the head to disorient them so they start firing at their own friends.\n\nThe best thing about the game is actually the highly entertaining storyline and characters. It's basically a mix between the future war scenes from Terminator and the replicant stuff from Blade Runner. So in a way it is quite derivative, but it is done in a style that is very Japanese and typically Sega-ish, which means it retains an identity of its own.\n\nIt takes a while to get going, however, but I'd suggest sticking with it for a few hours as it improves a lot in the second half of the game.\n\nMost characters in your squad are great (especially the French robot, Cain), and your performance in combat as well as your responses to questions they'll sometimes ask you will affect their opinion of you, and consequently change the ending of the game depending on how much they like you.\n\nOverall this is much more fun than po-faced Gears of War, and if you picked it up in the Humble Bundle recently but haven't played it yet I suggest you correct that mistake.\n\nPro-tip: The SSAO in this game looks pretty bad (very blurry) on High for some reason, whereas Low looks much sharper, so I'd recommend that instead.","March 30, 2014","true","11.0"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

As soon as you start it does SUCK, I was about to stop playing until got through first chapter. All seemed too cliche and too clumsy also the controls were quite wierd for me.\nBut then it just devoured me... I mean, the plot the gameplay and the "Surprice Surprice" all those cliche characters started making sence and the game humour made it more enjoyable.\n\nWhat I personally consider as pros:\n+ Nice story  - closer to the end you actually start to love it and enjoy, because first couple of minutes - i just hated it. The story is, frankly, nothing new, especially with all dem "Deus Ex" and what not but it has it's own nice twists and turns for which I liked it so much.\n+ RPG Element  - It's quite funny to see how your replies matter on the way other caracters feel for you.\n+ MassEffect 1 Style upgrading  Remember we all loved how the weapon upgrades worked in ME1? Well, you'll see plenty of that stuff in "BD" and imho here it's even better =)\n+ Relaxing Shooter  - When you got tired of all those fast action FPSs and TPSs and want just to relax and hit the mouse button - definitely your choise\n+  Not "Soupy and Blurry" cutscenes  - Even though there is a lot of cutscenes they are looking in most of the cases good. And the cheeziness of characters plays well with it.\n+  Nice number of minigames  - game has something like 20 minigames where you have to dive, drive, shoot out of a truck, train and etc. for you to change the gameplay and entertain =)\n+  The Super Populair  QUICK TIME EVENTS   - because there can simply not be a game without that thing, but they are set in logical places and actually help to expand the story\n\nSome cons as well:\n-  Mostly stupid AI  - It was not easy for me,personally, not to loose sometimes the rep among squad due to idiotic mates who run into crossfire for no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason. But then again - you get a headshot and rep is back to where it was.\n-  A corridor Shooter  - Even though some might love them, I find it a bit sad that there was always just one ruite to go.\n-  Story is incredibly dumb in the beginning  - I'm afraid many might drop it before playing due to that very reason.\n-  I find the standart controls and mouse sencitivity not very comfy  IMHO it took some bits of time to get used to either super fast steering with mouse or vice versa super slow, which was not very pleasant thing in the begining. Especially when your rifle is ♥♥♥♥ at first =)\n\nNevermind all of the cons, the game is very good.\nI'ld rate it 8.5/10 for my own reasons but I really enjoyed spending time in it.\nIf there would have been a part 2 - "  yes m8, I'ld buy it 8/8  "","May 5, 2015","true","13.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","8","10","0","1"

Must buy if you like shooters\n\nGraphics: Game looks great, simple as that. The cutscenes look really good as well.\nAnimations: A bit buggy sometimes, but most of the time it's excellent (motion captured)\nSound: some amateuristic stuff like hearing the same moan 20 times in a second when you get hit by a minigun, but the music is very atmospheric and the voice acting is excellent\nGameplay: It's a third person cover shooter. There's loads of fun bossfights and a lot of different enemies. You can clear the campaign in 10 hours.\nControls: In some sequences they're clunky. The game was clearly made for consoles and for controllers, but it's pretty solid with keyboard+mouse.\nSquad: there's a mic tool to boss your squad around, but I haven't tested this. You can give them simple commands as well via a menu. Your teammates will behave like a bunch of headless turkeys sometimes (running in front of your fire, not taking cover, not firing), but they're okay in general. Squad interaction (relation system) is excellent. There's a couple of levels where you have time to talk with all of them.\nStory: The story is a lot more than you'd expect from a modern shooter.\nTechnical: No crashes, no glitches, runs smoothly on a high end rig (i5 processor, GTX970 card, installed on a SSD)\nConclusion: Definitely recommended to people who like shooters.

Otherwise, the story while corny in some areas, is the typical good guys go in to stop bad guys. What makes this different though is the fact that the game has a trust system with your teammates, and as a result the characters themselves aren't one-dimensional, often engaging in conversation with you and whoever else you decided to partner up; as a result the game has lots of conversation options, and depending on how you respond in game will factor highly later on.\n\nOnly cons I honestly have for this game is the lack of co-op, as I would of enjoyed playing this with a friend, as the AI while passable leaves a lot to be desired. Another thing that bugged me is that during firefights I noticed the enemies would always target me, and ignore my partners firing on them despite me being farther away and them being up close to the enemies (bosses especially).\n\nI highly recommend it when its on sale or part of a bundle, would love to see a sequel.\n\nTLDR; Like blowing up robots?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tramor/recommended/203750/","tramor","treep-","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tramor/","1293 products in account","The short review: It’s Gears of Wars with robots instead of aliens. If that premise disgusts you, the post-cyberpunk storyline could be enough to save the experience.\n\nBinary Domain was published and developed by Sega, by the same internal team who brought us the Yakuza games for Playstation 2 and 3. The Yakuza games are essentially JRPGs with an open world veneer, a realtime hand-to-hand combat system set in a sprawling recreation of Tokyo and other Japanese locales with many people and things to interact with. So it’s a bit peculiar that the same team came out with something that may be considered “opposite” to that format: a linear, cover-centric third person shooter set in a beautiful yet sterile dystopian sci-fi world. So many third person shooters in this vein have popped up this past console generation. Some had you kill hordes of aliens (Gears of War series) while others had you mow down fields of Africans (Resident Evil 5) or the entire population of China (Kane & Lynch 2). Binary Domain presents the player with a different, less-fleshy kind of enemy to dismember and destroy: heartless robots and scraps of evil metal. It’s a refreshing change to be “killing” these scrap heaps, shooting their metal bodies and watching the various parts and components spark and hit the ground. The sensation is often invigorating, like smashing an empty aluminum can on your forehead or something (I’ve never done that before). The guns have a big, weighty feeling, like holding the big plastic guns from one of those old Sega light-gun arcade games such as Gunblade NY. And you can rest easy as they crumble to the ground, knowing that it’s only a soulless piece of machinery that you so ruthlessly filled with submachine gun bullets.\n\n(...B-but, c-can I really destroy these creatures without any remorse???)\n\nBinary Domain’s storyline is part Ghost in the Shell, part Terminator, part schlocky action-movie machismo. The main dude you play as, Dan, is somewhat charming and cool but also an idiot, as are many of the other squad members you interact with. The “romance” is laughably bad and I won’t mention any more of it. The real meat of the story deals with an arms race between two corporations to produce the most advanced robots, with one of those companies eventually creating a robot that could pass for a human. These robots come to be known as “Hollow Children” and their spread is feared by various governments. Your job, as part of a multinational coalition, is to go to Japan and find the original creator of the Hollow Children and bring him in for questioning.These Hollow Children have no idea they’re actually robots and can blend in a crowd with authentic skin, voices, and everything. Without giving too much away, this leads to a lot of fun questions and twists (Is he a robot? Is she a robot? Am I a robot?). Though it’s cool to see these themes touched upon, the game never really delves too much deeper into the ontology of man-made beings like the way the Ghost in the Shell film or other cyberpunk canon did. It’s here to give you a fun time, first and foremost. To quote a dialogue from a cutscene at the beginning of the game, an army man in a military boardroom ponders, “If it’s indistinguishable from humans, where does the machine end, and life begin?” which gets this response from a gruff comrade: “This is philosophical bull ♥♥♥♥.” The game’s narrative tips in the direction of that latter sentiment most of the time. We, the average consumer, like games because they let us toss plasma grenades at baddies and give us protagonists who leer at hot chicks, fistbump and make little jokes. Questions surrounding our increasingly digital existence seem at odds with the desire to let loose and have a bit of a good fun time. A philosophical challenge doesn’t give me the same kind of challenge that a huge robotic gorilla sub-boss does.\n\nThere is fun to be had, definitely. The bosses are huge, have unique designs and can be quite difficult. There’s a French robot who joins your team complete with a ridiculous accent. The guns feel good and the squad command system is kinda cool to tinker around with. But with all this emphasis on squads and teamwork, it’s really a shame that there’s no local or online co-op mode in the campaign. Maybe the developers want you to get close and share struggles and joys with the AI teammates, mirroring the way the human characters in the game’s narrative interact with the various robots and Hollow Children. I’m a cynic though, so I’ll chalk up the lack of co-op to a rushed development cycle or a design oversight.\n\nDespite my complaints and exhaustion with the genre, Binary Domain is still better than the average third person shooter and worth a look. Its narrative is an entertaining mix of action and sci-fi, a good weekend thrill. The gameplay, while a bit derivative, is competent and has a few new neat mechanics to offer. So, go tear apart these robots limb by limb, have a small pondering session, and then quickly return to the fun of the violent sparks. Having fun is what separates us from those things, isn’t it?","March 8, 2014","true","16.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

There are genuinely good moments in both the gameplay and the story but in the end it mostly ended up being a very mediocre experience. The shooting and cover based mechanics are pretty much identical to gears of war which is a bad thing to me because i always found the gears of war gameplay dull, boring, repetitive and that gameplay translates over to binary domain. I just think that there are alot of better third person cover based shooters out there like spec ops the line, mass effect 2, max payne 3 etc. The story has its moments but it also ends up being average at best. It's brought down by cringeworthy cheesy and cliche dialogue, unlikeable and bland protaginist and side characters and moments in the story that just made me roll my eyes. Your teams ai is awful there is no reason to give out commands that whole mechanic is broken and wasted and game is unplayable with keyboard and mouse so keep that in mind.

They are a tool, and as such they fulfill their role in modern society. The problem comes when and this is the starting point of the game- completely haphazard way, the government of the United States finds that for more than half a century there are integrated into human society, completely unaware of their condition robots. This represents a serious breach of the convention in which the great powers agreed precisely never lead artificial intelligence so far, so an alliance of countries decides to send a Chinese built by American special forces command, French, British and, to infiltrate in Japan and bring the responsible to justice. Dan Marshall, our charismatic protagonist, is one of two Americans chosen for the mission ... which of course goes wrong in every possible way.\n\nGameplay\nThe game is quite interesting in their subject , but does not offer much gameplay is refreshing and satisfying.\nAt first slow and it becomes a bit boring but if you have enough patience you discover their virtues.\nYou can afford to destroy androids big and spectacular graphics while watching bits are made.\nThe dialogues are simple so you will not get bored listening long conversations also influences the attitude of your fellow players and help you or not depending on whether they " likes you " .\nSomething remarkable is that it has a voice recognition system if you have a microphone. Although not a very advanced system and it only works with certain words that are already predefined .\nThe variety of scenarios is very large and quite addictive and interesting plot and some touches of humor.\n\nPros\nAction at all times, a story that takes different colors at all times, How to differentiate a human from a machine ?, that's one of the many questions that will come up in the game.\n\nThe gameplay is something innovative, actually just before seen in this class of games, using voice commands to manage your squad, it is really like and that gets you even more in the game.\n\nThe graphics are very good, excellent optimization, destroy robots is something pleasant in this game, as seen, the sound, are components that really make all that much more enjoyable.\n\nSound as I said before is absolutely excellent, maybe the sound when shooting is not 100% real, so to speak, however it is still excellent.\n\nA story that never disappoints. It is certainly a story that will leave you wanting more and 10 hours of campaign surely make you short, if...this would have to go in bad, but few stories are those that leave you with this feeling.\n\nThere is a French Robot.\nCons\nThe voices , if they contradict myself with sound , however the voices , especially the squad , are one of the biggest mistake , at least as I see it .\n\nThe controls is one of the things that I had more problems, is really uncomfortable, but once you get used to your controls can play a more smooth and comfortable way.\n\n9.5/10 Very recommended.","March 12","true","1.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's story is compelling, the combat is fluid and I had a lot of fun playing it. I start this review off that way because I have some major complaints.\n\nFirstly, the AI for your team is absolutely awful. When they aren't running in front of your gun while you're busting baddies, they're cowering behind cover because that one scrap head is just too fast for them to shoot all by their lonesome! The AI reaks on both sides though, so at least your team isn't alone in being stupid.\n\nSpeaking of a stupid team, how you ever imagined what British, Chinese, American, and French stereotypes would be like if they were trapped in a room together? Well, with Binary Domain, you get to find that out. The characters aren't bad, mind you. Dan is likeable if a bit of a jerk, Charlie has a tree firmly planted in his rump but he still manages to be a great guy, and Cain is hilarious. The problem is that they feel so flat most of the time. They'll give you little quips about how great you are, which you can respond to, but they all basically sound the same: Dan is a badass. Yeah, I figured that out after I got a triple headshot kill without using the scope on my sniper rifle. No need to remind me every five minutes.\n\nNow for the good stuff. It is recommended, after all. The combat using your rifle is fun and intuitive. Blow off legs, heads, arms, anything! It fits perfectly with the narrative o the game and there is nothing more fun than blowing off the arms of a robot and watching it run around the battlefield like a headless chicken. Grenades make stuff go boom, rifle shots feel like they could actually do damage, and the various secondary weapons are both fun and useful.\n\nThe story, of course, is equally good. If you're looking for a quick, whatever storyline, you have the wrong game. The pacing is excellent and the characters liven it up wonderfully, causing tension in all the right places. Even the ham-handed stereotypes actually feel decent in many parts of the story. Some of the dialogue is outrageously cheesy, but it's placed so well you won't realize how ridiculous it was until later. Which is another thing going for it: you actually keep thinking about the story throughout the game. I had a lot of trouble getting my mind off the game and the characters because they are so memorable. My only story complaint isin the bosses. They are a progression from big robot to bigger robot to BIGGEST ROBOT to screw-this-game-I'm-done robot. It's so obvious and overdone that, if the enemies are robots, they have to get bigger in video games, it's, frankly, boring.\n\nWhen it comes to difficulty, I picked it up and beat it on Survivor (hard) mode without too much trouble. I died only on the QTEs and the last boss of the game. Sure, I got knocked down a lot, but medkits are everywhere and extremely cheap to just buy in the store. It's not terribly hard, but you'll notice a few points that'll test your abilities.\n\nSo with that, I fully recommend Binary Domain. It's a great romp through the future of robots with enough twists to keep you engaged and a cast that, while a bit flat, will become memorable- even enjoyed. Even at full price, it's more than worth the money.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DazeOfWar/recommended/203750/","DazeOfWar","Daze The Bear Chieftain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DazeOfWar/","4588 products in account","Binary Domain is a third person shooter based around the concept of man creating a true A.I. that has been living with humans unnoticed till now. They are called hollow children and they don’t even know they are robots. Your job is to go into Tokyo and take down the company who created them.\n\nThe story in this game was a little slow at first and wasn’t to captivating till about the 4th or 5th chapter in and then it really picks up. The characters and their cheesy dialog between each other is what you are used to seeing a lot of times from Sega. This is not a bad thing though as it is funny at times and fits the game well.\n\nThrough the game you will need try and build their trust with you so that they will not hesitate to help you when needed. This also can change the outcome of the ending. This is all done through dialog and your actions with them. You will have a total of 7 characters on your team but can only take 2 with you on levels most of the time. You can also issue commands to them like regroup, fire, and cover me. This can also be done through voice commands through a mic which I didn’t try out myself but did seem like a cool feature.\n\nWhen in combat you can use objects and walls to hide behind for cover. Weapons are based around your normal arsenal of assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, etc. Each character has a personal gun and skills you can upgrade by making purchases from store kiosks you find throughout the levels. Money for the store is earned when you kill enemies and bonuses can be achieved too by doing this like headshots or multi kills. It may take multiple playthroughs to max everything out.\n\nGraphics still hold up pretty well and some of the enemy designs were pretty good. Voice acting was good and fit the character animations pretty good. It’s kind of like a B movie which in my opinion is always enjoyable.\n\nI did have some issues with the game. At times when you are in gunfights your damn teammates would walk right in front of you and get hit by your gunfire or block your view. If they get hit this also drops their trust with you. Camera was also a pain at times. Mainly when you would get knocked down by an enemy. It would focus on you laying on the ground and if you tried to look around it would snap back to your character. Characters were also very sluggish getting up or getting help to get up which then some enemies would constantly stomp on you so you couldn’t get away. It wasn’t often but when it happened it sucked. Last one was in one level you are riding in a vehicle and you have to shoot down some guys in the air but the vehicle swerves constantly which jars you back and forth like every two seconds causing you to fight with trying to aim and actually hit something.\n\nOverall it was a fun game to play and the story really pulled through for me in the end. There are also multiple endings for repeat playthroughs if you’d like to see them all. It has a multiplayer option too but I didn’t try it out so not sure if there is anyone even playing it anymore or if it works.","April 30","true","12.4"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

The first thing that will strike you is the destruction physics of the robot--there's nothing like it in any other game I've played. There is an incredibly visceral feel to every shot you take that either dismembers, decapitates or otherwise cripples a robot. Every weapon feels really good and every baddie feels really good shooting. Boss fights are particularly satisfying as they often evolve and change tactics as you decimate them piece by piece.\n\nSecond, the near-future setting and story taking place in a closed-border Japan is really really cool. The environments give an epic feeling making you feel like as small as a fly. And the story, although not terribly deep, keeps things moving at a nice pace alongside the constant action. As mentioned previously, the dialog is really, really, cheesy; but somehow it works. I don't know whether it was done on purpose but you feel like you're in a B-rated sci-fi film except that it's actually quite entertaining. Finally, the game is the perfect length for me--it's always better to want to stay in the game's universe a bit longer than getting bored and having too much. Binary Domain does the former. Overall, A fun sci-fi action-romp that surprisingly became one of my favorite underrated games.","September 24, 2014","true","15.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

While being eclipsed by the great releases of that year, the game achieved somewhat of a 'cult-game' status, and it's easy to tell why.\n\nSTORY(Spoilers)\nThe game premise is one that has been treated in other media, but it tries to cleverly add more elements to humanize it further.\n\nYou play as Daniel 'Dan' Marshall, an operative of the International Robotics Technology Association, the enforcers of the New Geneva Convention, a treaty between the world's countries that survived after the sea levels rose, that banned, among other things, the creation of robots covered with biological tissue, the development of Artificial Intellects that had feelings and believed themselves human, or any other related technologies. The core of the IRTA is composed by the "Rust Crews", paramilitary squadron composed by members of different nationalities with full backing of the United States Military Forces, who are trained in combat against all types of combat robots know to man.\n\nAfter a robot of human appearance attacked the offices of Bergen Robotics (the biggest developer and manufacturer of robotic technologies in the US), it is brought to the attention of the IRTA that these "Hollow Children", as they are called, could be the creation of Hioji Amada, founder and CEO of Amada Corporation (Japan's greatest robotics company), probaby due to Amada's humiliation at the hands of Bergen during a copyrights' lawsuit. It is then that a Rut Crew, comprised of Dan, Roy "Big Bo" Boateng, Charles "Charlie" Gregory, Rachel Thownsend, Faye Lee, and a CN7 combat robot, is sent to Japan to infiltrate the seawall, find evidence of Amada's involvement with the Hollow Children, and bring Hioji Amada back to Geneva for trial and interrogation. The infiltration goes awry, and the Crew finds themselves cut off, chased by japanese Police and Amada combat robots, and with little time on their hands before Amada can destroy all evidence. With the aid of the japanese Resistance they'll continue their mission, even when they find out a piece of information that could pit them against each other.\n\nGAMEPLAY If you have played any Third Person Shooters in the last... five years or so, then you've seen it all: there's the cover-based combat system, the melee feature that let's you finish off 'dying' enemies (they are robots, after all), the poweful weaponry (with at least one weapon of each category), and the extremely muscular male characters.\n\nThere are some features that set it apart from the rest of TPS, like the branched out storyline, whose progress depends heavily on the game's trust sytem. Whenever you are paired with up to three aditional characters, you build trut by slaughtering great numbers of enemies in little time, or by positivile interacting with them during dialogs through the game's dialog system. The higher their trust levels are, the better they'll perform in combat, they'll heed your orders, and the tory will advance positively for the player. However, if the player fires at them, interacts negatively  during dialog, nd generally behaves like a jerk, they'll refuse their orders, their usefulness in combat will be limited, and the story will end badly for Dan. The trust system alone is a great incentive for replayability, and makes for a compelling story that shifts with the player's decisions.\n\nHowever, not all of the game's mechanics are this useful. Nanomachines, for example, work like perks, and can be combined in the squad menu. While you can access that menu any time you want, once you find a combination that works you will never care for it ever again.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\nNothing worth noting. You have the standard PvP modes, like DeathMatch and Capture the Flag, (which have been done to death in pretty much any other Multiplayer games) and the Invasion mode (the game's version of Gears of War's Horde mode), which pits you against CPU-controlled waves of enemies that would love to cut your head of your body. PvP is pretty much dead (unless you catch the odd straggler that hosts matches), and you will find a few Invasion matches here and there.\n\nGRAPHICS\nAverage, although the japanese cyberpunk theme lends itself for interesnting artistic visions of robots and weapons. The animations are stiff at times, something that you can understand and forgive from the robotic foes, but unforgivable from the human characters, and at other times they are incredibly exagerated and out of tune with the game' context (specially during in-game dialog). One thing that can be fully commended is the animation and texturing of the enemy bosses, titanic robots that will give you a very hard time... until you figure out their attack patterns. These bosses are so exagerated that one could have forgiven clumsy animation during the fights, yet the robotic behemoths are superbly provided with detailed animations for their movement and attacks, very a la Transformers. Guess that can be expected from a part of the world where mechs and gigantic robots are the bread and butter of their fiction media.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\nIf you expected the Soundtrack to be a collection of electronic tracks, you were half-right. There are electronic pieces that play during combat, and which will pump you with much appreciated adrenaline for the ride, while the instrumental pieces will spice up the moment where the game tries to take itself seriously. You won't find an uninteresting track in this collection, and that speaks volumes for the game's quality.\n\nOVERALL\nYou have a game with a main character that looks suspiciously a lot like Adam Sandler, that does both comedy and seriousness, with  compelling and interesting plot and characters, and solid combat mechanics. All thiss for less than $15 bucks. What's not to like? Get this game, go!","April 26, 2015","true","14.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Binary Domain tells the story of a world in which global warming has caused worldwide flooding, leaving most of the once liviable world completely inhabitiable. To survive governements built new cities on top of the ruined ones, however since many died due to the flood robots were used for much of the labour. One such company, American-based Bergen, controls a large portion of these robots, making America a great power in the new world order. A Japanese robotic corporation named Amada tried to sue Bergen claiming they had stolen their technology patent. This lawsuit failed. The result was Amada's reputation suffering greatly thus leading to Bergen controlling 95 percent of the worlds robotic economy.\n\nWhat sets the story in motion is the creation of the "New Geneva Convention". Clause 21 is key to the story of Binary Domain. The clause bans "research into robots that could pass as children", reffered to as "Hollow Children".\n\nThe story follows the character of Roy Boateng (Steve Willingham), Roy is the leader of 'Rust Crew', a group of operatives choosing by the International Robotics Technology Association (IRTA) to investigate breaches of the convention. After an android attacks Bergen's HQ in Detroit, claiming he had no idea he was a robot, the IRTA has reason to believe that robotics genius and founder of Amada, Yoji Amada, created the robot, effectively creating a "Hollow Child". Rust Crew is then sent to Japan to find Amada and bring him in for questioning.\n\nOverall the story is told fairly well, while not outstanding or particularly cinematic, it has a very anime feel to its narrative devices. The story has enough depth, with twist and turns along the way, to keep the player enaged throughout the 8 or so hours they will be playing.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe gameplay is very much a product of the period in terms of third-person action games. It's cover-based shooting in genuinely open areas allowing for enough freedom to engage in combat as you see fit, head on or use flanking techniques. All in all it feels a lot like Gears of War, if a bit clunky in terms of its controls and shooting mechanics.

Binary Domain tells the story of a world in which global warming has caused worldwide flooding, leaving most of the once liviable world completely inhabitiable. To survive governements built new cities on top of the ruined ones, however since many died due to the flood robots were used for much of the labour. One such company, American-based Bergen, controls a large portion of these robots, making America a great power in the new world order. A Japanese robotic corporation named Amada tried to sue Bergen claiming they had stolen their technology patent. This lawsuit failed. The result was Amada's reputation suffering greatly thus leading to Bergen controlling 95 percent of the worlds robotic economy.\n\nWhat sets the story in motion is the creation of the "New Geneva Convention". Clause 21 is key to the story of Binary Domain. The clause bans "research into robots that could pass as children", reffered to as "Hollow Children".\n\nThe story follows the character of Roy Boateng (Steve Willingham), Roy is the leader of 'Rust Crew', a group of operatives choosing by the International Robotics Technology Association (IRTA) to investigate breaches of the convention. After an android attacks Bergen's HQ in Detroit, claiming he had no idea he was a robot, the IRTA has reason to believe that robotics genius and founder of Amada, Yoji Amada, created the robot, effectively creating a "Hollow Child". Rust Crew is then sent to Japan to find Amada and bring him in for questioning.\n\nOverall the story is told fairly well, while not outstanding or particularly cinematic, it has a very anime feel to its narrative devices. The story has enough depth, with twist and turns along the way, to keep the player enaged throughout the 8 or so hours they will be playing.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe gameplay is very much a product of the period in terms of third-person action games. It's cover-based shooting in genuinely open areas allowing for enough freedom to engage in combat as you see fit, head on or use flanking techniques. All in all it feels a lot like Gears of War, if a bit clunky in terms of its controls and shooting mechanics. As the game progresses it will introduce different enemy types, requiring varying strategies to defeat each new enemy type. Overall the gameplay isn't anything new or groundbreaking but it is solid, fun and genuinely enjoyable.\n\nTL/DR\n\nSolid game with a few issues that don't detract from and overall enjoyable game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antimagicSA/recommended/203750/","antimagicSA","anti-magic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antimagicSA/","448 products in account","On paper it sounds awful; Gears of War 3rd person shooter with a B-movie plot and characters but it manages to work. The gameplay is tight and works well on both gamepad and KB+M. Shooting robots is made entertaining by effectively intergrating locational damage: shoot off it's head? It will go haywire and attack it's own buddies. Legs? It will try to shoot you or crawl in an attempt to tackle you. The guns are admittedly a little dry and are nothing new, but they're reliable and you know exactly what you're getting when you pull the trigger.\n\nThe extremely predictable plot combined with the charmingly cliche characters are what really make this game a fun romp though. It's almost a loving tribute to every action or sci-fi movie with a ragtag bunch of soliders with varying backgrounds and ethnicities coming together to shoot a scientist/dictator/ex-soldier who has gone ONE. STEP. TOO. FAR! It's ridiculous and every character is a classic archetype spewing out one-liners at every turn.\n\nAlso there's a trust system, which you obviously want to max out with each character to get the best ending. You can upgrade your main weapon (and allies too), equip "nanomachines" to give you certain stat boost and choose from a selection of sub weapons to diversify your ability to destroy hordes of robots. The boss fights, particularly around the first half of the game, deserve a special mention for being intense and involving gigantic robots.\n\nThis really is the kind of game where you need a six pack on hand because there's nothing better than sinking beers, shooting robots inbetween laughing and cheering during the cutscenes. Binary Domain isn't going to knock down the doors and expand your mind (most likely the opposite to be honest) but it is a truly fun game and is often on sale giving you no reason to avoid picking this up.","August 27, 2014","true","10.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Despite the rather serious story, there are many amusing dialogues and slapstick-ish moments between you and your squad members, which is a nice change for the action-packed fights.\n\nBeing a third person shooter, Binary Domain comes with the typical cover-based gameplay mechanics and controls, so nothing new or surprising there. When played with mouse and keyboard, the aiming can act a bit funny at times, but all in all the controls are responsive and get the job done.\n\nTo my surprise, the game comes with a couple of tactical elements. You can order commands to your squad members, upgrade your own and your squad members' weapons, equip them with various enhancements to improve their abilities and endurance and during certain key points in the game you even get to swap your squad members entirely.\n\nAdditionally, with dialogue choice and ingame actions you alter your squad's morale and either increase or decrease the trust they put in you. Depending on that, your squad members may eventually disobey your orders during a fight, leaving you alone against a hoard of enemies.\n\nWhile the game doesn't exactly provide you with extensive graphics options, it looks and runs fairly decent. Partially, you encounter some low-resolution textures in the game, but overall there's not much to complain.\n\nA really cool and innovative thing in the game is the SpeechFX feature. If you have a microphone plugged in, you can configure and use it within the game to reply to your squad members or issue orders by directly saying 'Move', 'Hold' and so on.\n\nWith around 10 hours of playtime for the story, it provides a decent length without ever really getting tedious or boring. Binary Domain also features a multiplayer mode with various game modes, however, unfortunately it is pretty much dead by now, so don't even bother thinking about buying the DLCs for the game.\n\nAll in all, Binary Domain is a surprisingly good third person shooter with funny dialogues, cool tactical elements and a lot of action, so if you're up for some robot ♥♥♥-kicking, make sure to check this game out!","April 4, 2013","true","10.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/emnii/recommended/203750/","emnii","emnii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/emnii/","1171 products in account","All of the descriptions of this being a Japanese Gears of War are completely accurate. It's a third-person cover-based shooter, with a quirk in that you can influence how much your team likes you by speaking to them using your headset. You get prompted with yes/no questions pretty often, and they like/dislike you depending on your performance in combat. Shoot a bunch of robots, they think you're great! Shoot them, and they complain. Something I didn't necessarily realize is that the social system affects your ending!\n\nThe game looks great. It's super-smooth, with only a bit of slowdown when I'd have like 10 robots exploding at the same time, and that was really rare. There are a ton of boss fights, but none of them are frustrating as they all subscribe to the "shoot the blinking parts" philosophy. The controls work great with mouse and keyboard. The voice acting isn't perfect, but your team is composed of soldiers from different nations. Some of the accents are bad, and some are passable, but what thrilled me is that the Japanese police, who would have no business casually speaking English to each other, actually speak Japanese with subtitles! That tiny attention to detail means a lot to me. When Return to Castle Wolfenstein came out and all the Germans spoke English with German accents, I was totally disappointed.\n\nThe story is well written. It's a nice sci-fi, what makes a man yarn. It has a pretty lighthearted tack to it, without being completely cartoonish. It's more like a good action movie that occasionally asks serious questions. It sets up a sequel, which I'm looking forward to, but I don't think we'll see. I don't think Binary Domain sold all that well, and it's a serious departure for its creator who previously made all the Yakuza games. I never played any of them, but they have a rather dedicated following.\n\nNext time Binary Domain goes on sale somewhere (I got it from Amazon, Steam-redeemable), you should get it. Don't be completely turned off by the B grade cover art. It definitely exceeded my expectations.","November 25, 2013","true","8.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

The game itself has almost nothing new: run, take cover, shoot. The gameplay is pretty repetitive but not boring, it has some good ideas, nothing revolutionary though. But the cutscenes are simply masterpiece! When you watch them you almost forget that this is a game, it's really like a movie. The story is very good, the characters are all cliche but interesting, plus this game has some pretty cool boss fights. Basically this is one of those games where everything says that this is just another cheap-quality cover-shooter with bad controls, BUT you nonetheless like it.

This is one of those games. you should give this game a shot.\n1. Fast, smooth, TPS experience. Give orders (via keyboard OR if you have a headset, via voice) to your teammates.\n2. Build trust to your teammates so that you get to see how they bond to one another, and to unlock one of 3 endings.\n3. Fantastic voice work, very funny and interesting cutscenes all across the game.\n4. Beatiful areas and robot! This may remind you of Ghost in the Shell series a lot.\nBAD:\n1. Some part of the game has those moments where you must complete an object in a short time, under heavy enemy fire. If you can handle it, this shouldn't be a problem for you. Else, it may irritate you.\n2. Not having a mic can remove the fun out of your command-giving experience.

The story is great, but very cliche until the very end. The combat is pretty common for a shooter, nothing amazing. I did have fun in the long run. There were some amazing boss fights and the art design was gorgeous.  Sadly the game has some big downsides that might scare people off. The major ones I ran into was with the controls. The game wouldn't let me remap left shift, and often it gave me the wrong button prompts during timed events. Finally there's a few auto scroller sections that you can tell were not made or changed at all for mouse and keyboard. One of the worst ones was with a speed boat. It tells you to use A and D to move left to right, but once pushing them it's not just a little move, but a drastic shift. Hit the walls too many times and you need to retry. I did this around 10 times before finding my brothers Xbox controller. First try with a controller I got it. You could lightly press left or right and move just slightly, unlike with A and D which are counted as full button inputs left or right.\n\nMyself, I wish there was a Muh rating. I had fun and didn't totally hate it, but I wouldn't force people out to buy it. On the other hand it's not total trash and wouldn't tell anyone no if they did want to pick it up. Again think of it as a B movie. It's fun even with all the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ parts.","January 21, 2014","true","8.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The developer team, associated with SEGA, has created the “Ryu ga Gotoku” series, known as Yakuza in the west.\n\nEast & West united: Gundam meets Blade Runner\n\nNo need to study an entire Yakuza encyclopedia this time: “Binary Domain” draws heavily from the western SciFi genre (most prominently: cyberpunk classic Blade Runner), making the squad-based shooter a more universally accessible affair. Similar to Ridley Scott’s neon-colored dystopia “Binary Domain” is set in a not-so-distant future. In the late 21st century technology has taken giant leaps, but of course, everything else is straight down the gutter: Global warming, rising sea levels, poverty… you name it, “Binary Domain” has it. With worldwide population significantly decimated, robots had to be used as the main labor force to build new cities, and they also came in handy as domestic servants or kids’ playmates. But the pro-robot-agenda has ceased since Japanese-made “Hollow Children” – almost indistinguishable from humans and potentially violent – kept appearing. The countermeasure?

The developer team, associated with SEGA, has created the “Ryu ga Gotoku” series, known as Yakuza in the west.\n\nEast & West united: Gundam meets Blade Runner\n\nNo need to study an entire Yakuza encyclopedia this time: “Binary Domain” draws heavily from the western SciFi genre (most prominently: cyberpunk classic Blade Runner), making the squad-based shooter a more universally accessible affair. Similar to Ridley Scott’s neon-colored dystopia “Binary Domain” is set in a not-so-distant future. In the late 21st century technology has taken giant leaps, but of course, everything else is straight down the gutter: Global warming, rising sea levels, poverty… you name it, “Binary Domain” has it. With worldwide population significantly decimated, robots had to be used as the main labor force to build new cities, and they also came in handy as domestic servants or kids’ playmates. But the pro-robot-agenda has ceased since Japanese-made “Hollow Children” – almost indistinguishable from humans and potentially violent – kept appearing. The countermeasure? The “New Geneva Convention”: Prohibiting production and distribution of human-like robots.

From the sewers of half sunken Tokio, to it's highest skyscrapers, you'll kill robots...lots of robots...some really big ones and some really small ones, but still lots of robots.\n\nTIP: game has "voice command your AI pals" technology, but it's a mixed bag and not really good if there's other people in the room with you, but you can turn off this feature and command with keyboard controls easily\nTIP: blow off robot heads, it's fun and makes fights easier\nTIP: game is a port and takes a while to get used to the keyboard+mouse controls, but use the in-folder configuration exe to figure things out and you'll be fine","August 19, 2014","true","9.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Binary Domain is a love-letter to classic Cyberpunk, such as Blade Runner and Ghost in the Shell, as well as the works of Isaac Asimov, and films like The Terminator. Gameplay is a bog-standard third person, cover shooter, affair (with a speech-command gimmick that doesn't work too well), but where this game truly shines is its characters and setting. Based in a futuristic setting where global flooding has devestated the world, Binary Domain explores themes such as classism and racism/dehumanisation under the backdrop of an isolationist, class-divided Tokyo. The game featues a cast of fully fleshed out characters, whom you can't help but become attached to, with some of the cheesiest one-liners seen since an 80's action movie.\n\nHighly recommended to all fans of science fiction, and cyberpunk in particular.","August 22, 2014","true","8.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

After a while, I bought it on Steam and boy, what a game it is!\n\nBinary Domain takes on the mechanics of classic Gears of War and throws in a highly-engaging storyline with some great character development and nice twists in a futuristic setting that Isaac Asimov or Arthur C. Clarke would dream up. It's got some great run-and-gun mechanics, annoying but challenging boss fights, and manages to switch up things pretty nicely every once in a while. You'll be shooting behind cover, then speeding on jet-skis, firing from a car, using an anti-tank turret, and even hack into one of the big robots to let all hell loose! The action is so intense that you'll constantly be on edge and run straight into fights with your adrenaline pumping.\n\nThe game suffers from a few flaws, namely the voice recognition system, certain UI peeves and a bit of stiffness with regards to controls. However, this is in no way a deal-breaker. What you have here is an extremely fun game that you will be looking forward to once you wrap yourself around some of its nuances and ignore a few of the systems.\n\nI'd highly recommend any action-game afficionado to pick this one up either on sale or through a bundle. It's a game that you definitely will not regret adding to your collection.","November 4, 2014","true","12.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The acting is good, motion-captured animation nuanced and natural, graphics and design reflecting the developer's high production values. The game keeps a light tone with plenty of humour and has multiple endings depending on your relationship with your crewmates.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Binary Domain is a typical third-person shooter, mixed up with boss fights and set changes. The controls give away a console port; the default scheme is unconventional but eventually easy to use. You determine the make-up of your team, and the characters chat with you and each other. You can gain their trust by displaying competence in battle, talking to them, and avoiding shooting them in the back. When you give orders, they obey more readily the more they trust you.\n\nThere is an optional voice recognition feature for barking orders to your crewmates, but it could not tell my voice apart from keyboard strokes. No big loss—most times, the only request I have for them is to avoid jumping in front of my gun, and they mostly keep from doing that without being told. Besides, you can give the same commands from the keyboard.\n\nIn summary, Binary Domain is a polished third-person shooter with an unusually good storyline but some rough edges around porting the interface to PC.","December 16, 2015","true","48.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, the AI tends to be a little dumb, and love to take their time when you´re down and want them to heal you.\nSpeaking of gameplay, the game has a really interesting voice commands feature.

What is really annoying is how the game automatically assumes that you will be playing on an xbox controller. It's amazing. As soon as you start the game all of the instructions are given with the xbox buttons. I beat my head against the wall as I tried figuring out which key did what. So I had to quit the game and go into configuration menu to figure out how to play the damn game.\n\nThe main pillar of this game is the gameplay. It's pretty fluid but I still find the consolized running slightly sluggish. The first 20 minutes of the game are kind of boring and slow but the game gradually picks up the pace. The plot is convoluted at first but you eventually realize the gravity of the invasion of the dormant sleeper cyborgs which is pretty cool.\n\nBack to the gameplay, there are the usual steps like take cover, shoot, gather the pulse charge, throw the grenade AND.... order your teammates to either cover you, advance or hold the ground. At the very beginning of the game the trust level between you and your team mates is pretty low though so do not expect them to always follow your orders. For instance if you tell them to charge the advancing robots, your partner will basically tell you off.\n\nWell, the story is okay. There are a few good dramatic moments. The story not only focuses on you and your team mates but also on the gangs and the law enforcement. So it is nice to see the game world unfold through different vantage points. You get to interact with your team mates as well as other miscellaneous characters during the game. You can choose different dialogue options the outcome of which will influence your team mates' level of trust towards you.\n\nThere are annoyances though. Most of the time your AI team mates will keep saying the same thing over and over again should you venture away from them. They will say things like "Sam, over here!", "Sam, you are going the wrong way", "Sam, what are you doing? Grab that grenade launcher".\n\nSo yeah, on one hand there is communication with your team mates, but on the other hand there is a limited amount of one liners to be thrown around.\n\nAnother MAJOR annoyance is the inability to turn off music, that's right. The incessant battle rock will keep playing almost every time you are in a major engagement. I was really hoping they would tweak the PC version better and give us the opportunity to get rid of music for maximum immersion. This kind of thing ruins many games for me. I mean it is EASY to implement that option in games.\n\nI felt like some of the checkpoints were not equally balanced. I had to restart my progress way back because the checkpoint was placed way to far. Such examples include the water chase stage and the highway chase stage.\n\nThe water looks atrocious, seriously. It's like this horrid looking gray sheet that you cover yourself with every night.\n\nAnother annoyance is that even though your character speaks in cut scenes, your character NEVER says anything during in-game dialogue which is kind of sloppy. They could have easily programmed the number of various responses into the dialogue, so I know they just got lazy.\n\nI also didn't like the level design much. I know it is a small thing to gripe about but I just didn't feel that inspiration from visiting the various locations in the game. I mean the skyscraper stages are nice but some of the industrial areas are pretty boring. Some levels are as boring as visiting a box factory. I think what could have helped is the vivid background animation. Just throw in some background activity like running civilians, passing cars, machinery producing somethings, etc. The metropolis just kind of felt empty.\n\nSome smaller flying enemies in re-spawin a couple of times in the game which is a no no in my book. The enemy AI is also not particularly smart. They rely on firepower and numbers more than agility and taking cover.\n\nAs you progress through the game, you will meet certain soldiers of different nationalities. You will even meet a peaceful robot. Some of the missions will give you a chance to choose different partners. You can only only have 2 partners at a time. Each friendly AI has a different weapon and specialization. You get to keep 3 health syringes and so do your team mates. When you are down you can either use your syringe or ask them to use theirs to pick you up. There are various weapons in the game\n\nIn many ways the game reminded me of Vanquish although that game had a much faster pace. The boss fights are pretty cool but most of the time it is still about finding the vulnerable spots and shooting those. There are also some cool set pieces but the dated animations detracted from having too much fun. I just did not find the graphics all that compelling in general.\n\nFor the most part the game holds up. It is fun killing robots, conserving your ammo, working with your teammates and getting out of near impossible situations. As you kill enemies, you accumulate credits which you can use for upgrading weapons. You can beat about half the game and only be able to fully upgrade your basic assault rifle. There are also not as many robot models - around 5-6, not counting the sometimes bigger enemies.\n\nThe game also screams for co-op campaign. They could have easily implemented it here since you are never alone during the campaign.","November 27, 2013","true","5.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It takes place on futuristic earth (Japan) where iRobots are rising up in rebellion against humans, yay! Sadly that's as good as the plot gets. There's decent voice acting. However the characters are basically just borrowed from other action franchises, renamed, and thrown into a squad for this game. There are some really cool robot designs, especially with the boss robots. There's a loadout system, where you add nanomachines to your rig, however they don't make a noticeable difference, and can be completely ignored. Your in game money is better spent upgrading your gun. Thumbs up on the gameplay. Binary Domain is a 3rd person cover shooter, and it does pretty well at it. Having once been an Xbox guy, it's safe to say I own all of the Gears of War titles. I know a good cover shooter. Binary Domain is not GOW, don't expect it to be, but its the best 3rd person shooter I've played on Steam. The squad can receive orders via keys, or accept them from your microphone. And since the squad isn't very good at following orders, you can drop the F-Bomb on them (the game actually recognizes a few curse words), and that makes for a good laugh when they respond back. Multiplayer is just horde mode, or verses, not much going on there.\n\nA fun campaign with just over 11 hours of play. Worth a buy on a Steam sale.\n\nVisit our Currator Page","February 24","true","11.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Yeah, but this doesn't mean the question mark key, apparently it means "any key" - but the question mark is not an any key! So it's "almost any key" then... Let's try space... OK, that works.\n\nSo the game starts, and you're shown your controls. Hm, the pictures of the 1, 2, 3, 4 keys are laid out in a square, like the controller's d-pad. Besides, the game is unplayable with a gaming mouse, and there are no sensitivity settings or anything (there are no settings in general, so this is just one drop in a huge ocean of disappointment).\n\nOK, but that's why we have an Xbox controller! A bad port won't scare us, right? NOPE. You connect the controller, start the game again, and the tool tips are still showing pictures of keyboard keys! So now not only are you trying to play a shooter with a controller (ugh), you're also guessing which button they mean when they show you some letter!\n\nNow, you're thinking, sure, apparently there are some issues with the controls, but you can get used to anything as long as the story is good! This is some cross between The Matrix and Mass Effect or something! Again, NOPE. Story is flat, dialogue is clichéd, team mates are annoying.\n\nBut maybe it's a good shooter! Triple-NOPE. It's a cover-based, health-regenerating heap of boredom. The enemy AI is stupid, your team mate's AI is stupid, and the contrast with the game's backstory of human-like, super-intelligent AI, is almost funny.\n\nThe only redeeming quality of this game is the voice recognition mechanics. Haha, just kidding, it mostly doesn't work - but even if it did, it's totally gimmicky.\n\nNow, the graphics is actually good - or at least on a standard level for a shooter. But this is basically the only thing that is normal in this game.\n\nI don't usually write reviews, especially bad reviews ("if you can't say anything good, better say nothing"), but you, dear reader, deserve to be warned.","March 24","false","1.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

To make it worse: robots have appeared which believe to be human themselves, and you are send to investigate the origin of these robots after one of them ran amok in the USA. Welcome to Japan, where the most advanced robot producing company produces their 'products'.\n\nBinary domain starts as one of the usual third person shooters with covers announcing everywhere you'll get to find the enemy. As usual, you have a main weapon and you can pick up secondary weapons according to the situation. The enemies are robots with guns in different sizes and with different equipment like bulletproof shields or jetpacks. You play in a team with other soldiers with everyone having their own traits and even a personality shown in cutszenes and during the game. Something uncommon is also that you can upgrade your weapon, making it from a below average gun to your favourite tool to turn off enemies. Exactly, you are going to fight robots only except a few rare cases.\n\nAnother special feature this game has are decisionsyou have to make, and your teammates react to your decisions. they fight better if you support them, but they will fight less good and even reject orders if you ignore them. Usually this is not a big concern if you fight well.\n\nLast but not least, let me mention the biggest enemies. I don't mean big, I mean BIG bossfights. Occasionally, you will encounter robots as large as small houses with each one require special tactics to beat them. They are challenging and fun to master. Does anyone here remember the last bossfight of Mass Effect 2?\n\nSo sum it up, Binary Domain is a well done third person shooter available for a more than reasonable price which offers 10 hours of gameplay.","March 8, 2015","true","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Most everything of this game is unique!  The Story line is unique the enemies are unique, the weapons are unique, and even the characters are unique!  Not only are they different, but they are emotionally amazing to watch!  When I played the game I got really attached to my comrades, especially the ones I always team up on.  And when they almost die, it is like a stab in the heart for me.  I never have been so attached to an NPC in my life, other than Mass Effect Series.  This game is amazing beyond compare, and I do not realize why it has such a low metascore it deserves at least an 80 or higher in my standards.  The one other thing that caught my eye is the mass number of different kind of robots that are in the game, sure there are the average Green Foot Soldiers but they account for the mass horde that attacks you!  It is just an amazing feeling to go up to an enemy Scrap Head and mash it to pieces with the butt of your rifle and watch it fall apart!  I must say the Graphics are amazing, and the physics are just as great!\n\nAnyone looking for long, hard, and enjoyable story needs to check out this game!\n","January 11, 2013","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Another great thing is the boss fights while they can be your typical generic fights they still prove to be a good challenge. The game also throws in some RPG elements like upgrading weapons although sadly its only for primary weapons and not for your secondary or pistol and there is also skill augments to boost health and such. Last but not least the AI for the game works well although and responds well to the command system although its not recommended to use voice commands since its very buggy.\n\nStory:\nThe story starts off kind of well and slows down a bit but around chapter 3 it really starts to pick up and near the end it has some really good bud mind♥♥♥♥ing twists to it that will leave you hungering for SEGA to hurry up and make a sequel.\n\nCharacters:\nAll of the characters have great voice actors and are very well animated with my favorite being Cain that is an android halfway through the game.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics overall are very well done although nothing that will push the capabilities of any machine so most people can run it on high settings with no problem. Its to be noted the game has a 30 FPS cap set on it because this is a really bad PC port so they didnt do the simple task of taking off the limit but like many PC games simply modding/adding a file can remove the FPS restriction to provide smoother animations and such.\n\nSound:\nTruthfully I didn't notice the music too much because I was so focused on blowing the robots to bits but the sound effects are well done.\n\nBugs:\nCamera bug - The game has no bugs to speak of although once or twice I had a camera bug which is no big deal because the game uses checkpoint autosaves almost every 100ft or so on the levels making it easy to restart from a checkpoint if you encounter this bug. So if you encounter it just restart from a checkpoint because its not that big of a deal to be honest.\nControl prompt bug? - Can't really say if this is a bug since generally most ♥♥♥♥ PC ports of games have really badly optimized control schemes but the prompts in this game tell you "M" to fire(left click), aim down sights(right click), and lastly to use the shock burst ability(hold down middle moust button) which is annoying at first but you can easily deal with it after you get used to it 1-2 chapters into the game.","September 11, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Haven't played multiplayer cuz I heard it's terrible but campaign is really fun. most of the story concepts are derivative of movies and anime. headshots have more incentive than other games because they cause robots to attacks each other (unless you use the sniper rifle). voice control is horrible. I spent an hour on configuring the voice controls only to get 50/72ish words recognized. It's just better without. the voice controls/ interactive concept is only for affecting your squads loyalty (decides whether they follow your orders). Every time you shoot an ally by mistake you lose loyalty; which is really annoying considering they will roll/change cover even if it takes them right in your line of fire (very common). can be really humorous. the controls the game says to use are incorrect and also don't change when you use an xbox controller; it will say to click 'M' when it's really your mouse left-click. it starts and closes really quickly on my entry level pc. buy it on sale. I definitely got my $4 worth!\n\nAlso, you can't change graphics settings or controls from in-game. it has to be done via the game configuration (when you launch from steam). I have 2 monitors and it defaulted to the wrong monitor so make sure you check out the configurations when you start.

The story isn't bad, although the poor writing definitely makes it appear a lot worse than it actually is, relying on some really cliched, cheesy interactions between characters. I've heard it's a bad port, having nearly unusable mouse+keyboard controls, but when using a 360 controller it functions exactly as the console version, so I'd recommend that route.

Most everything of this game is unique!  The Story line is unique the enemies are unique, the weapons are unique, and even the characters are unique!  Not only are they different, but they are emotionally amazing to watch!  When I played the game I got really attached to my comrades, especially the ones I always team up on.  And when they almost die, it is like a stab in the heart for me.  I never have been so attached to an NPC in my life, other than Mass Effect Series.  This game is amazing beyond compare, and I do not realize why it has such a low metascore it deserves at least an 80 or higher in my standards.  The one other thing that caught my eye is the mass number of different kind of robots that are in the game, sure there are the average Green Foot Soldiers but they account for the mass horde that attacks you!  It is just an amazing feeling to go up to an enemy Scrap Head and mash it to pieces with the butt of your rifle and watch it fall apart!  I must say the Graphics are amazing, and the physics are just as great!\n\nAnyone looking for long, hard, and enjoyable story needs to check out this game!\n","January 11, 2013","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very satisfying.\n- Mild RPG elements that allow you to upgrade your weapons and statistics.\n- Bosses are huge and difficult to take down with tactics that involve more than your standard "wait till it shows the weak-spot" kind.\n- Different dialogue based on who is in your team.\n\nCons:\n- Friendly AI is pretty dumb and will run out of cover, dance around the battlefield or refuse to leave areas with respawning enemies.\n- Trust system doesn't amount to much and is easy to max out as long as you always agree with your team-mates when they talk. I didn't notice any difference between a high and low trust level either.\n- Commands also don't seem to work very well, so I ended up ignoring them. In the few cases I tried to get my AI to regroup while they were stuck in a different AI they would tell "that won't work" or something like that.\n- The love-story that develops as you progress the game felt off to me, especially since it involved a character I never interacted with and never added to my party.\n- Cutscenes often froze on me for a few seconds.","March 22, 2014","true","10.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The characters were certainly a lot more fun than the chunky Dudebros in Gears, but the story itself is about on par with Bionic Commando 2009's ridiculous plot twists. It may be crazy and totally nuts, but I felt that the game wanted me to take it seriously, rather than looking at these kinds of games and stories in some kinda funhouse mirror.\n\nThe high point of the game are its boss encounters, which are charmingly modeled after old-school boss fights in which the goal is to shoot the core. These setpieces (though at times frustrating) are the welcome break between all the unimpressive corridor shooting and extraneous RPG elements.\n\nIf you want some decent'ish cover-based shooting and a schlocky and fun set of voiced and written characters, you got it. Binary Domain is competent enough to be entertaining for a bit, but it's designed by folks who still don't quite understand why the more renowned entries in this genre work.","February 23, 2013","true","11.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

To make it worse: robots have appeared which believe to be human themselves, and you are send to investigate the origin of these robots after one of them ran amok in the USA. Welcome to Japan, where the most advanced robot producing company produces their 'products'.\n\nBinary domain starts as one of the usual third person shooters with covers announcing everywhere you'll get to find the enemy. As usual, you have a main weapon and you can pick up secondary weapons according to the situation. The enemies are robots with guns in different sizes and with different equipment like bulletproof shields or jetpacks. You play in a team with other soldiers with everyone having their own traits and even a personality shown in cutszenes and during the game. Something uncommon is also that you can upgrade your weapon, making it from a below average gun to your favourite tool to turn off enemies. Exactly, you are going to fight robots only except a few rare cases.\n\nAnother special feature this game has are decisionsyou have to make, and your teammates react to your decisions. they fight better if you support them, but they will fight less good and even reject orders if you ignore them. Usually this is not a big concern if you fight well.\n\nLast but not least, let me mention the biggest enemies. I don't mean big, I mean BIG bossfights. Occasionally, you will encounter robots as large as small houses with each one require special tactics to beat them. They are challenging and fun to master. Does anyone here remember the last bossfight of Mass Effect 2?\n\nSo sum it up, Binary Domain is a well done third person shooter available for a more than reasonable price which offers 10 hours of gameplay.","March 8, 2015","true","12.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sega do occasionally make some very good games and this has the potential to be one of them.\n\nIt's a 3rd person shooter with team based mechanics, giving orders and building a relationship with your team AI is one of the main focus points of this game. The relationships will affect dialogue and also how they respond/help you during combat situations.\nThe voice acting is pretty poor but it adds a kind of comedy element to the story. The gameplay itself is pretty solid. The movement can feel a tad heavy at times but the shooting mechanics make up for it. The guns have good feedback and hit recognition which makes the limb mechanics that much better. The enemies you'll  be fighting are robots and you can shoot off body parts which all affect how they react/move during gameplay.\n\nIf you can grab this game cheap you won't be dissapointed\n\nBINARY DOMAIN - 7.5 / 10","September 7, 2015","true","5.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I remember looking at a gameplay trailer for this game back in 2011 and was psyched, but other games went ahead to suck me in and I totally forgot about Binary Domain until I got it recently through the Humble Bundle sale. Needless to say I am very disappointed that I did not play such a great game when it came out, and I would not mind playing it again.\n\nBinary Domain is an amazing TPS in which its strong point lies within the story. Set in a 2080 version of Japan, Dan Marshall and his crew are sent in to take down a robotic threat. The story digs deep into the game, explaining the threat that is happening in Japan in a unique fashion. Many rising actions, plot twists, and more can keep you on your toes and be ready for more excitement. The characters in the game are worth noting too especially with the trust level system where you can increase the faith that your comrades have on you by doing certain actions. More trust in certain characters increases the likelihood that they will listen to your commands, another facet of the game. While commanding your allies is interesting, the big letdown of this feature is the voice recognition system which fails to work from time to time. Even then, there aren't enough commands to allow you to be a true squad leader, and sometimes the AI doesn't seem to follow your orders correctly despite having a lot of trust. The combat is your typical TPS gameplay mixed in with enemy robots that can lose their arm and still be able to fight. While the fighting is generic, you can mix up your play style through the usage of commands and the destuctible robots. And to top it all off, there are bosses that are mostly well designed and tough to beat. The soundtrack is great, but it doesn't seem to be played enough in game. While the cinematics are amazing, the voice acting could use a bit of work. Overall, Binary Domain is a solid TPS with a astounding storyline that will get you to play more.","May 25, 2014","true","12.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Another great thing is the boss fights while they can be your typical generic fights they still prove to be a good challenge. The game also throws in some RPG elements like upgrading weapons although sadly its only for primary weapons and not for your secondary or pistol and there is also skill augments to boost health and such. Last but not least the AI for the game works well although and responds well to the command system although its not recommended to use voice commands since its very buggy.\n\nStory:\nThe story starts off kind of well and slows down a bit but around chapter 3 it really starts to pick up and near the end it has some really good bud mind♥♥♥♥ing twists to it that will leave you hungering for SEGA to hurry up and make a sequel.\n\nCharacters:\nAll of the characters have great voice actors and are very well animated with my favorite being Cain that is an android halfway through the game.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics overall are very well done although nothing that will push the capabilities of any machine so most people can run it on high settings with no problem. Its to be noted the game has a 30 FPS cap set on it because this is a really bad PC port so they didnt do the simple task of taking off the limit but like many PC games simply modding/adding a file can remove the FPS restriction to provide smoother animations and such.\n\nSound:\nTruthfully I didn't notice the music too much because I was so focused on blowing the robots to bits but the sound effects are well done.\n\nBugs:\nCamera bug - The game has no bugs to speak of although once or twice I had a camera bug which is no big deal because the game uses checkpoint autosaves almost every 100ft or so on the levels making it easy to restart from a checkpoint if you encounter this bug. So if you encounter it just restart from a checkpoint because its not that big of a deal to be honest.\nControl prompt bug? - Can't really say if this is a bug since generally most ♥♥♥♥ PC ports of games have really badly optimized control schemes but the prompts in this game tell you "M" to fire(left click), aim down sights(right click), and lastly to use the shock burst ability(hold down middle moust button) which is annoying at first but you can easily deal with it after you get used to it 1-2 chapters into the game.","September 11, 2014","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Graphics are decent, voice-acting is serviceable and the gameplay mechanics all work well (aside from using grenades, which require you to switch to them as a main weapon). The story isn't bad, although the poor writing definitely makes it appear a lot worse than it actually is, relying on some really cliched, cheesy interactions between characters. I've heard it's a bad port, having nearly unusable mouse+keyboard controls, but when using a 360 controller it functions exactly as the console version, so I'd recommend that route. If you like cover-shooters and see if for a few dollars, I'd recommend picking it up.","June 29, 2013","true","25.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Now i'm able to play it with my new rig and finished it. I wanted to change my review as it changed my oppinion for it.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------- 2nd review:\n\nThe year is 2080. a lot happened. We play a character named "Dan the survivor" who is part of a small elite goup called Rust Crew which is in charge of eliminating the robot enemies with covert operations around the world. This time, we crash on Tokyo for another investigation mission and the story evolves around.\n\nThis is a very basic 3rdPerson shooter, over shoulder cam with some poor cover mechanics. Very linear. Worst UI design example ever. Performance issues. Bugs here and there. Clunky and awkward controls. Very limited weapon options. Don't even think about changing your armor. Questionable enemy variations. Very little and predictable enemy AI. Unpredictibale companion behaviours in combat. Cheesy dialogues and acting. Poorly implemented voice recognition system. Gfx looks old as of today, etc.etc. the list goes on. Very easy to get frusturated and uninstall at first 10 minutes. Normally, i wouldn't recommend any game in this condition.\n\nBUT ( insert a very big but here... and i like big buts )\n\n1- Shooting is just done right! The game gives a great satisfaction feel as you play it. Shredding armor and limbs of your enemies has never been so tactical and so satisfying and visually appealing. The enemies doesn't have just one big HP bar on them, no! When shot, enemies react well to where they've been hit. If they have armor, you have to expose their armor too. Toring apart enemies limb by limb has never been this fun and important. Mind you, almost all your enemies are military Robots.\n\n2- Companions are very well done. They feel unique and organic. You become friends with them. You care for them. And If you care for them, they care for you too in your desperate times. They don't need baby sitting most of the time but they reflect their experience with you. They respond to your call as a leader and expect you to respond to them as team member. They motivate you to fight better whilst they are amazed by your skills. All companions uses different weapons and they fullfill your lack of weaponry as a group. Sometimes they are unpredictable in battle. Sometimes they ask for your permission to engage enemies with their unique skills. By the end of the game, your relationship with your comrades, defines the final cutscene.\n\n3- Boss fights are hellova fun and dramatic. Unrealistic and absurd most of the time but VERY entertaining, action packed, challenging, and memorable. Bosses themselves are very creatively designed. Boss fights feels like old school fashion.\n\n4- Most importantly, this is a story rich game more than it is just a brainless shooter. Hell yeah it is. some bad acting cheesy dialogues here and there but still a philosohical sh.t right here. Back story and setting is amazing, Throw in some deus ex, hal9001, blade, cyberpunk materials... Binary Domain is a sight to behold and dwell on. I won't tell any further details but it certainly made me think and question of ethics, of god, of society, of human interractions, of possible future. It gets deeper every corner. Thankfully it's not a short game and we have plenty of time to consider what is going on in the game.\n\ni'm just glad i was able to finish this game now. Yeah, it's frusturating but i was able to overlook it's flaws and enjoy the carnage. Shoot the bad robots in many many different occasions with my buddies and drown in the philosophy it throws on my face.

Like the controls are solid, I think the characters are really amusing and what I'm doing all the time is actually pretty cool, which is to say dismantling robots with a perfectly good firearm.\n\nWhat I am saying, gaming community, is that I like a game that I was probably the target audience of. Stop the presses, holy ♥♥♥♥, wow, what the hell is this.\n\nThere is one gripe, one, one huge gripe, and that is that the voice control thing is a pile of garbage. Thankfully that is just as easily replaced by a few simple button presses and, even though it's basically useless, is no reason to overlook this game. Yeah one gimmick didn't work but like, thirty others did. Like seriously, the tiny details in this game that make it more entertianing is the kind of stuff that should be taught in future game design.\n\nSo, yeah, sign me up for future rust crew action any time, this game is awesome.\n\nAddendum:\n\nJust beat this thing.... Devil's Details is better at action movies than Capcom.\n\nAlso, the quicktimes are the most infuriating thing I've ever seen but compared to a lot of big name devs they were practically sparse. Get rid of them entirely and this is maybe a perfect action third person shooter. Like, I shot lots of things, the controls worked pretty well, I actually kind of liked the characters most of the way through (that is to say 'thought they were well written' rather than 'thought they were good people') and I would honestly be up for the next Binary Domain if there is one.\n\nSeriously, get this and play through it, it's amazing.","March 2","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Pick it up at a sale for ~10 hours of great shooting sprinkled with uneven but often suprisingly good writing.\n\nI had a surprisingly good time with this game, it blends western and japanese design trends to great effect. It is a bit rough and choppy, and it is obvious that the development was cut short by publisher demands, but for what it is its a damn decent game.\n\nThe basic gameplay of shooting robots is really solid, and most of the boss fights were a great time. For a 3PS cover-shooter the combat is very mobile and dynamic.\n\nWhat surprised me most was the quality of the writing and acting: Its not perfect, and cliché at times, but it brings some real emotion and tackles some pretty high-concept sci-fi themes. For better or worse it tells its story in a very "Japanese" way: philosophical themes and strong emotions, though often heavy handed and with a distinct lack of player choice.","December 6, 2015","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Random-Person/recommended/203750/","Random-Person","Randomperson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Random-Person/","50 products in account","Graphics: The reason I decided to get this game was because I am a MASSIVE fan of the (sadly PlayStation exclusive) Yakuza franchise which was created by the same person as this and developed at the same Sega-owned studio using the same game engine. And WOW, the difference between the two platforms is absolutely remarkable. This game runs at 60FPS virtually all the time on my PC, the field of view is adjustable for both running and aiming and is set nice and high by default so you've got a good view all around you, and all of the menus and HUDs and everything just look really modern and smooth. This is in stark contrats to Yakuza, which just looks clunky and outdated by comparison, not to mention the woeful FPS, which can sometimes cause actual slowdowns like you'd get on an emulator if they decide to add in particle effects. All this on a game engine that was DESIGNED for Playstation exclusivity! I suppose I'm being a bit unfair, as 3rd person linear shooters like this are always going to use up less resources than an open-world game like Yakuza, but it just goes to show why people like PC gaming so much. I mean, sure, good graphics don't make a good game, but it's certainly a nice thing to have as far as I'm concerned.\nStory: This is where things get interesting. You're actually running on a consequence-based system, so what eventually happens to the characters (including whether some of them live to see the end of the game) depends on how much trust you build up with them during gameplay (more on this in a bit). I won't bore you with a story synopsis since you can just get that off the store page or Wikipedia, but personally, I liked the way it unfolded. It's got a few nice twists and turns here and there and whilst it's not the most amazing or unpredictable story you'll ever experience, it's certainly a damn sight better than your average Call of Duty game.\nGameplay: If you're used to battle games, this one won't be a problem as far as the mechanics of the shooting, taking cover, that sort of thing are concerned. The only issue I had was that the game was very sensitive to mouse inputs, but if you've got a mouse with variable sensitivity, just turn it down and it's not much of an issue. The enemy AI is pretty good, and you really have to move around between bits of cover to avoid them busting you out, making for a challenging shooting game. The most annoying issue of this whole game is the fact that they developed it with voice input in mind. In theory, it allows you to give orders to your characters, as well as answering questions that will raise their trust level with you if you answer correctly. This can be pretty annoying during battles if you don't want to use the voice input system or you don't have a microphone, because you have to hold down the capslock key and select your answer using another key, all while your character is basically disabled. Not exactly ideal at all if you're trying to shoot at robots and whatnot. The trust system can be quite annoying during gameplay as well. If your character becomes too badly injured, they will have to heal themselves with a health kit, or be healed by one of their team mates. If you refuse to be healed by someone, that person's trust in you will decrease. These are the most annoying issues of the game, and if you can live with them it's fine. You also gain increased trust for being good at shooting, getting a lot of headshots and whatnot, so this is a good game for people who are good shooters.\nAlthough you always play as Dan on this game, you do have a choice as to what people (or robots) you want in your battle team for particular sections of the story. Each character carries their own type of weapon, meaning that you have to be careful with character selection. There is also the chance of upgrading both weapons and character abilites by spending money earned for defeating bad guys.\nAudio: This is probably the weakest point of the game. I think the gun sound effects are pretty weak if I'm honest, but what I really don't like is the voice acting. I mean, given that most of Ryuu Ga Gotoku studio's games are only dubbed in Japanese, I think having a game dubbed not just in Japanese and English, but SIX languages was always going to be ambitious to say the least. I get the feeling that Sega simply contracted out the voice work to some American studio who had little to no idea of what foreign people actually sound like. I mean, it's not as if they skimped on the voice talent, with both Laura Bailey and Troy Baker having roles (I'm starting to think these two are some kind of prerequesite for including in an English dubbed videogame these days...) And I must say that Baker's British accent as Charlie is pretty good, but Bailey's performance as Faye Lee is pretty awful. She sounds more like someone from Mexico than China. Normally she's a fantastic voice actress, but I think foreign accents are clearly her weak point. The woman who did Rachel's voice was by far the worst though. She had the same sort of cringeworthily fake "British" accent that you'd expect to hear on an episode of The Simpsons. Not to mention she couldn't even say "Yakuza" properly. Some characters didn't even bother with trying to put on an accent, one little girl in the slums speaking English in a perfect American accent. Overall, the cringeworthy foreign accents really ruined the story for me, giving you the impression of some low-budget B-movie, rather than the sci-fi epic it was clearly supposed to be. It's not all bad though; Dan's got a Harrison Ford-like voice which fits his character very well, and Boateng's voice fits the "token black guy" character pretty well as well. But then again, people who can do those sorts of voices are ten a penny in the voice acting world, so it's hardly a massive surprise.\n\nOverall impression: Cultural ignorance aside, I do really like this game. It's fantastic for anyone who likes 3rd person shooters as well as futuristic sci-fi types of games like Crysis. And of course, this game is a must for any Yakuza fan.

I don't feel like upgrading and spending on a new mic just for this game, and I would love to see an update for the voice recognition some time in the future, other than that, this game is really well made, nice guns, upgrades, coop with AI is what I also love, you are not alone at any moment, effects and graphics are really nice as well.\nFinal score 8/10 just cuz of the voice thingie!","March 2","true","5.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like the controls are solid, I think the characters are really amusing and what I'm doing all the time is actually pretty cool, which is to say dismantling robots with a perfectly good firearm.\n\nWhat I am saying, gaming community, is that I like a game that I was probably the target audience of. Stop the presses, holy ♥♥♥♥, wow, what the hell is this.\n\nThere is one gripe, one, one huge gripe, and that is that the voice control thing is a pile of garbage. Thankfully that is just as easily replaced by a few simple button presses and, even though it's basically useless, is no reason to overlook this game. Yeah one gimmick didn't work but like, thirty others did. Like seriously, the tiny details in this game that make it more entertianing is the kind of stuff that should be taught in future game design.\n\nSo, yeah, sign me up for future rust crew action any time, this game is awesome.\n\nAddendum:\n\nJust beat this thing.... Devil's Details is better at action movies than Capcom.\n\nAlso, the quicktimes are the most infuriating thing I've ever seen but compared to a lot of big name devs they were practically sparse. Get rid of them entirely and this is maybe a perfect action third person shooter. Like, I shot lots of things, the controls worked pretty well, I actually kind of liked the characters most of the way through (that is to say 'thought they were well written' rather than 'thought they were good people') and I would honestly be up for the next Binary Domain if there is one.\n\nSeriously, get this and play through it, it's amazing.","March 2","true","9.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Well this entire game is a babysitting game, and you can have up to 3 medis each, they use theirs fast in story mode as they keep going down, once you use your own on you, you can not use any on them, if you have none, you must find one, regardless of many enemies shooting at you, before their time runs out and dies, which then ends your mission.\n\nThe game is filled with looking after them and making sure they do not mess up the mission for you, so you are protecting them alot, and making sure they do not go down, but the story is a great story, i love that friendly fire determends how much your team trust you, you can also direct them with orders and responses using your own microphone. However, they do not cover, they run side to side, in and out, and constantly in front of your gun fire, leaving them to shout at you and decrease listening to orders.

The voice command is a really nice unique feature but poorly implemented. The characters have unique dialouge to some of the things you say to them but when you give an order like "charge" though your microphone and he confuses it with "i love you" it can be irritating. There is an alternate option to give commands other than voice however. Which is nice they bothered to add that.\n\nThe multiplayer has a player restriction before you are allowed to start the game. Meaning a couple of friends cant just go in and start playing together, you have to wait for a full room. I dont know why they thought this was a good idea. It essentially killed the multiplayer aspect of this game.

The perfect sleeper agents, who have been popping up across the world recently.\nAll clues point to a mysterious robotics company, led by a director that hasn't been seen in public in decades.\n\nIf that feels generic then you would be correct, the game hits a bunch of tropes over the course of its ~15 hour campaign.\nIn much the same vein your team doesn't consist of international characters, but rather of international stereotypes.\n\nThe arrogant American, the bro-tastic African American, the sarcastic Brit, the smooth French one, the stoic Chinese one.\nPlayers are unfortunately locked in as the arrogant American, but are free to choose which characters they bring on missions (up to two, only ones they've already encountered) which covers roles of the team that you don't want to take care of yourself.\nDon't feel like sniping? Bring the sniper. Prefer sniping instead? Leave her home and bring an assault character instead that will draw fire as you pick off enemy robots from a distance.\n\nYep, robots. All opposition you'll face, except for some very few exceptions, will be robotic creations of the robotics conglomerate. This might sound boring, but it allows for some very nice destruction systems where you can disable parts of your opponents, changing their behaviours. The generic humanoid variants will crawl around if you shoot off their legs and will start shooting their allies instead of you if you manage to shoot their heads off.\n\nYour squad mates will comment on everything you do, from yelling out requests for assistance to compliments on successful takedowns to talking about recent plot developments. You are able to respond to these, theoretically by using voice commands but for the people that couldn't be bothered (like me) there are also keyboard / controller responses available. They way you interact with your squad mates will raise or lower their opinion of you which does... something.\n\nI've only completed one playthrough, so I'm not quite sure what things could all have gone differently, but I feel that some squad members coming to my rescue and a romance subplot were optional things that I managed to trigger by which squad members I favoured.\nThis means that my opinion of the ending that I got might be completely irrelevant to your potential playthrough, but I REALLY liked the ending.\n\nIn fact, my opinion of the game almost consistently got higher and higher from its slightly shaky start.\nEverything slowly ramps up until an admittedly very... classic, quite predictable final boss fight that I felt was very satisfying (and, as it should be, it is definitely the hardest fight in the game, at least it was for me).\n\nIf you feel like playing a fun, highly playable action game with some clever twists and turns that gets better if you stick with it, definitely give Binary Domain a try.","March 25","true","16.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

But under its covers is a great game that isn't so generic, primarily because it doesn't take itself seriously at all. Binary Domain is one of those games. It has a somewhat generic plot of an evil executive/inventor who uses their robots to cause havoc and is creating an experiment that the US government isn't fond of, so the US government and the Geneva convention send in a Rust Crew to uncover the conspiracy. Yeah, it sounds pretty generic. But it's an absolute blast to play. There's a reason why some over-the-top third person shooters are so popular, it's because they're so much fun!\n\nWhat I also like about Binary Domain is the setting, the sprawling metropolis of Tokyo. And the main characters, their banter and wit makes the game so much more enjoyable and a bit light hearted instead of other third person shooters that take themselves too seriously. Binary Domain also utilizes a unique consequence system, where certain actions will either raise or lower the trust of your comrades. Dan Marshall, the character you play, runs into a number of people as your crew grows throughout the course of the game. Your actions can slightly effect the end of the game.\n\nOverall, it's just a ridiculous action game with a pretty good story, but really great characters that you'll grow to love. Smooth gameplay too. It's, by no means, a masterpiece, but definitely a great game.\n\n8.5/10","April 2","true","15.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In a nutshell, the game is Terminator action in the Bladerunner world, with Gears of War gameplay.

I think one of the main reasons people like zombies is that they splat rather well. Sega took this cue and actually made robots VISCERAL, and not in an Ash from Alien kind of way. The fantastic maner in which scrap metal is shead when these bots are shot makes combat a real charm. More games could learn from Sega's direction here.\nThe imact of bullets is somthing that rarely seems to get attention in games.

Huge landmasses have been flooded and many died. Gigantic walls were built to fend off the oceans. Only robots could achieve this colossal task. Having proven themselves robots are now present everywhere in society. This led two corporations to huge success, the American Bergen and Japanese Amada.\nAs a result politicians have put restrictive laws into R&D of life-like robots indistinguishable from humans, "Hollow Children". You play as a member of a RUST crew whose job it is to go after violations against these laws.\nWhen a Hollow Child not even knowing it is non-human is found, you and a multinational team are sent covertly to Japan to find evidence against the Amada corporation.\n\nGameplay:\nBinary Domain is a fairly standard third-person-shooter with many inventive systems. Each of your crew members has a "trust meter". This will either fill or decrease upon your choices during dialogue and whether you protect them during combat. Another neat idea is the implementation of voice-enabled commands. I didn't use a mic so I had to use pre-config commands via button press. These can go from combat orders like "Give me cover fire" up to opinions on your crews mood and comments on events unfolding in the story.\n\nAs a TPS shooting is the main focus. And boy does it shine. Movement is adequately quick with dedicated "dodge" moves. Weapon variety is standard with a nice selection of grenades. Experience points are used to upgrade your weapon and character stats. Don't expect anything too deep though. It is held enjoyably simple.\nYour arsenal will get its fair share of use against the many robots you will be facing in the ~8 hour campaign. To my big surprise devs managed to turn a cliche enemy like robots into one of the most enjoyable adversaries in a long time. They are not stupid! They will take cover, pop out to shoot, dodge attacks and be formidable opponents. Prepare to take cover a lot as rushing into combat will get you killed fast. But keep calm as disposing robots is as fun as it can get. Bullets stagger them with very good hit animations while clusters of their outer shell is shred flying all around the screen. Good placed shoots will sever limbs, send legs and arms flying around. Don't loose your focus though as these robots will continue pursuing you even without any legs. Headshots will turn robots into shooting sprees hitting their robot brethren, so keep your aim steady! Combat is the shining beacon among all other greatness. From the clean and futuristic landscapes with huge scope to the many and frequent set pieces which never outstay their welcome. Speaking of, levels are diverse while still retaining general tone of futuristic Tokyo. Each of them ends with a boss. Varying in fun while all of them can make quick business of you. Running from cover to cover, commanding your teammates at the right moment and using appropriate weapons will make them a challenge but never unfair.\n\nVerdict:\nNot having heard much from Binary Domain previously the screenshots and game banner did paint a very mediocre image. I'm glad I still gave the game a try as it became one of my most beloved TPS of recent years. It's polished with good voice acting, making me care about my teammates. The theme of robots and trans-humanism are interesting and were nicely woven into the story. Unforeseen twists kept me at the edge of my seat and I genuinely cared about the events that unfold. A very satisfying game which I hope gets a sequel.","January 10","true","16.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

And  being a console port is usually a bad omen. In this case it's not bad but there are some issues, mainly in audio department. Not being able to mute music is a major pain considering how bad it is.\n\nFortunately, the whole game is very solid. Shooting, although very generic, is fun. There is quite a selection of enemies that differs from each other. Moreover, every enemy can be dismantled not only for fun and additional points but to gain situational advantage. Take out their head and they will start attacking you enemies as well. Rip off their hand to disarm them. Shoot the legs and they will start crawling to you... Generally shooting is fun and tactical selection of targets and where to shoot compensates very limited options of commanding your squad and cramped locations with little room for manoeuvreing.\n\nBosses are bullet sponges and you have to dismantle them wheter you like it or not, as you get to their power core only after you destroy lesser cores  responsible for their movemenet \ armament. But they look good and developers tried to diversify them by locations where you fight them, equipement you can use + sort of quick time events that helps you survive or shorten their life. One time you will be blowing off legs of giant robo-octopus, other time you will be taking down dropship with Stinger Missiles or do a guns blazing getaway from some sick motor-like transformer.\n\nOn story and characters... Plot's mainframe is japaneese as hell. If you don't like animes, you will be surprised how stupid is explaination of who, where and why are you. Fortunately, everything between start and the end is good. Especially interactions bewteen the squad members. Although they are a bit cliche, they are well implemented. Brits are brit enough. Your fellow American is the very core of a trusted sidekick, French guy dies just after you met him, leaving you with his robot companion. And of course chick from China. They all have their distinct features and won't always agree with player. It matters because the plot depends on your choices you make mainly during coversations with team members. If you don't go well with someone, he will be reluctant to follow your orders. Or they will die. Or betray you.\n\nGraphics - they are fine, Not mindblowing but they keep decent level. What I liked the best is\nvisible distinction between asian and western stuff. Designer did hell of a great job in that department. Wheter it's\ngun, armor or mech, you can clearly see that it comes from Japan or western company. But it does not ends there - you can see differences even in things like... movement animations and gestures. Erase faces of two badasses from US and Japan and you will be able to say which one comes from where.

It isn't the best game in the world but it does a very good job at what it does.","August 10, 2012","true","14.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And I was sitting up in my chair, getting very interested in the drama all of a sudden. It was GOOD. The plot was intriguing, the characters actually had personalities, the voice acting was top notch, and they got actual Japanese voice actors to play Japanese characters, which is both a big bonus in my book, and makes the game feel anime-like a LOT.\n\nThe cutscenes are pretty much what makes this game good, like with Metal Gear Solid series. There's plenty of them, they have excellent direction and they have managed to get me hooked on the story, and even make me laugh out loud a few times!\n\nIf you're into futuristic robot-themed anime-like stuff, I can definitely recommend this game. It getting rather cheap on sales is also added incentive for getting it.","December 7, 2012","true","4.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Huge landmasses have been flooded and many died. Gigantic walls were built to fend off the oceans. Only robots could achieve this colossal task. Having proven themselves robots are now present everywhere in society. This led two corporations to huge success, the American Bergen and Japanese Amada.\nAs a result politicians have put restrictive laws into R&D of life-like robots indistinguishable from humans, "Hollow Children". You play as a member of a RUST crew whose job it is to go after violations against these laws.\nWhen a Hollow Child not even knowing it is non-human is found, you and a multinational team are sent covertly to Japan to find evidence against the Amada corporation.\n\nGameplay:\nBinary Domain is a fairly standard third-person-shooter with many inventive systems. Each of your crew members has a "trust meter". This will either fill or decrease upon your choices during dialogue and whether you protect them during combat. Another neat idea is the implementation of voice-enabled commands. I didn't use a mic so I had to use pre-config commands via button press. These can go from combat orders like "Give me cover fire" up to opinions on your crews mood and comments on events unfolding in the story.\n\nAs a TPS shooting is the main focus. And boy does it shine. Movement is adequately quick with dedicated "dodge" moves. Weapon variety is standard with a nice selection of grenades. Experience points are used to upgrade your weapon and character stats. Don't expect anything too deep though. It is held enjoyably simple.\nYour arsenal will get its fair share of use against the many robots you will be facing in the ~8 hour campaign. To my big surprise devs managed to turn a cliche enemy like robots into one of the most enjoyable adversaries in a long time. They are not stupid! They will take cover, pop out to shoot, dodge attacks and be formidable opponents. Prepare to take cover a lot as rushing into combat will get you killed fast. But keep calm as disposing robots is as fun as it can get. Bullets stagger them with very good hit animations while clusters of their outer shell is shred flying all around the screen. Good placed shoots will sever limbs, send legs and arms flying around. Don't loose your focus though as these robots will continue pursuing you even without any legs. Headshots will turn robots into shooting sprees hitting their robot brethren, so keep your aim steady! Combat is the shining beacon among all other greatness. From the clean and futuristic landscapes with huge scope to the many and frequent set pieces which never outstay their welcome. Speaking of, levels are diverse while still retaining general tone of futuristic Tokyo. Each of them ends with a boss. Varying in fun while all of them can make quick business of you. Running from cover to cover, commanding your teammates at the right moment and using appropriate weapons will make them a challenge but never unfair.\n\nVerdict:\nNot having heard much from Binary Domain previously the screenshots and game banner did paint a very mediocre image. I'm glad I still gave the game a try as it became one of my most beloved TPS of recent years. It's polished with good voice acting, making me care about my teammates. The theme of robots and trans-humanism are interesting and were nicely woven into the story. Unforeseen twists kept me at the edge of my seat and I genuinely cared about the events that unfold. A very satisfying game which I hope gets a sequel.","January 10","true","16.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Bosses involve hitting small moving targets (often while moving about yourself) while aiming in a narrowed field of vision and being unable to see attacks that will stagger, stunlock or OHK you. And that's pretty much everything wrong with the game.\n\nThe characters are brilliant, the banter between your squadmates makes them instantly lovable (though they will nag the hell out of you if you decide to go hunting for secrets), the level designs really give off the sort of air you expect from a near future society, mechanical designs are superb ranging from floating cameras to the sort of thing that will make you scream at your monitor "How do you make something like this and not call yourself an evil genius!?" (true quote), music and sound effects are solid even to the point of making sure that many of the Japanese you will encounter actually speak Japanese and their accents nail it when they speak English too. There will be scenes throughout the game that will make you question "Did that happen because I chose to take X with me?" and are executed flawlessly in line with the story. Which speaking of story, if you enjoy your cyberpunk stuff this has a bit of a typical subject matter but it is told exceedingly well.\n\nReally, this game is a hidden gem if ever there was one and for the price tag it's a crime against gaming not to at least give it a try.

Limited squad controls, useless speech commands and clumsy controls. The button mapping is the worst. They kept the merged keys, so usually there is one button for 2 or 3 actions which makes everything much worse. There are no graphics options, and almost no in-game options. As a port it is failed in so many ways.\nThe graphics are serviceable. Characters look good from a distance, but closeup the poor texture quality can be seen. Regular robot enemies are looking okay, they lose a lot of scrap before die, which looks great. There are some sequences where it is almost like a terminator game. Locations are okay, sometimes a little bit too strict. There are many good designs in terms of bosses, which are a lot of here. Also, there are too many special sequences in the game. Otherwise, boss fights can be interesting and rather frustrating either. This is a mixed bag.\nThe story itself is starting to get interesting after a few hours, but becomes quite a mess in the end. There are many cliched and cheesy scenes which are way out of track. The twists are pretty much foreseeable by anyone who used to watch movies. There is not much to say about it. In the 2/3 of the game there is a chance to select your teammates which will carry on with you. This adds some variety to the game. For example, I managed to select the robot with another one out of 5, then him out of 2 before a gas chamber room. He even said that he is not having a problem with the situation. There are various speech from squaddies during the missions which are spot on. They should had a lot of work with all the different dialogs.\nThere are some "rpg" elements also. You can buy upgrades for your mates, earn their trust by agreeing with them and leveling up their weapons. The options are pretty slim, but at least there are some.\n\nOverall, I had a rough start, enjoyed the middle and got exhausted by the end. I played on normal, and I do say I am happy, because I had enough pain with the mechanics and the bosses. If you are into japanese sci-fi flicks and comfortable with a controller then you might have a good time, otherwise I would stay clear.\n\nMy Opinion:\nOVERALL: 7/10\nGraphics: 8/10\nStory: 7/10\nGameplay: 6/10\nSound: 7/10\nReplay Value: 7/10","September 14, 2015","false","11.7"," 12 of 23 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","12","23","0","0"

The game itself is fun. Remember when this was kinda important in games? Yeah, it is mostly some cover-based shooting, but it just feels good - the graphics, sounds, music, cheesy one.liners, shuffling through various weapons.. it is a bit like the classic 80s-90s action movies. So that's all kinda okay.\n\nBut...\n\n..where the game really stands out is the story and the characters. The story may seem to be a little bit clich= at the beginning, but it develops very nicely and you WILL be interested in it (which is more than I can say about most of shooters), it even poses some quasi-philosophical questions! I loved it. Surprisingly, there is also some minor almost-rpg character upgrading and team management - you get to pick your mates (and improve your relationship with them that way, which makes impact on the story!! - show me any other shooter that does this) from a group of well-written individuals, each with a different combat style that can complete yours approach or mimick it (tank-like heavy gunner, shotgun shock trooper, sniper etc)!\n\nJust..give it a shot. You won't be disappointed.","November 22, 2014","true","8.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Maybe a mediocre game with laughable dialogue and good enough action to keep me interested. Instead, I think I got one of my suprise favorite games this year.\n\nFrom the get-go, you'll realize how similar it is to Gears of War. Even the font looks the same for the HUD. And you'd be partly right. It does cover-based third-person shooting pretty competently. What I really enjoy is the story. Right from the get-go, it establishes the world with its "Hollow Children", and, oddly enough, it feels natural. Being the makers of Yakuza, a franchise well-known for its story, I'm not too suprised. Maybe what sells it to me is the voice acting. They could've sent any old B-Team dubbers to pick this up, but instead we get Grade-A performances from Travis Willingham, Laura Bailey, and Troy Baker. Really, there isn't a person I can pick that was awful. It's kind of jarring that they use Japanese dialogue for the police (Which I enjoyed) but switch him to English when he talks to the party. And Johnny Yong Bosch trying to keep an accent with that was kind of strange, but almost endearing.\n\nBut this is a game, right? You're not here for the story! You want to shoot lots of scrap-heads! And that is also a fantastic time due to the limb system. Having tactics to maybe shoot approaching robots in the legs to slow them down while shooting heads off another group to start infighting makes the fighting unique to the genre. You will fight a lot of the same humanoid bots, but there still is a suprising amount of enemy variety, not to mention the boss fights. I was not expecting so many different boss fights, but they are certainly enjoyable.\n\nOne of the main advertised features of the game was voice commands, but honestly I didn't use them. My microphone is garbage, so that might have had something to do with the game not recognizing anything. You can opt to play without it, and I didn't feel very limited. There's a simple command list for your squad that does it's job. The affection system is interesting, and I was engaged in trying to max out my teammates. That might eventually lead you to min/max that stuff, but I recommend playing it blind the first time to see what outcome you take.\n\nOn a port scale, it looks stunning. I don't know about PC controls because I'm casual scum who plays with a controller, but that in itself was an enjoyable experience. No issues with inputs and all that.\n\nI didn't try multiplayer. I don't even know if the servers are still up at this point, or if it's local like Space Marine. Apologies.\n\nI'm almost a little worried giving this a glowing recommendation. I went in expecting schlock (Which it does feel kind of B-Movie sometimes- in a good way), or an unplayable mess, but I got a really engaging story and really enjoyable gameplay. Pick it up, and decide for yourself.","October 20, 2014","true","26.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Finally, you would become the protagonist, Dan Marshall (This is actually based on my real personal experience). You would feel his feelings, such as anger, pain, frustation and finally, happiness when reunion with Faye at the end.

I got it on sale, but, after finishing it, I can definitely say I would have gladly paid the $15 it's currently priced at.\n\nTechnically this is a cover-based shooter, but even on the hardest difficulty setting initially available actually using the cover mechanics is usually a suggestion and not a requirement. That's a plus, in my book; I find being forced to take cover every single fight is annoying as hell. That's not to say you'll NEVER have to take cover (although perhaps you can get away with doing so on the easier difficulties), merely that in most of the fights I experienced it was not necessary. This becomes doubly true later on in the game when you've been upgrading your assault rifle to its max stats; once I hit level 5 or so in firepower (out of 6 or 7, I can't remember offhand) I never took cover again except for boss battles.\n\nGunplay is tight. The main character has an assault rifle and a backup pistol (the pistol has infinite ammo) with him at all times, and a third weapon slot that can be used to carry enemy weapons or other pick-ups. I can remember the following weapons: the enemy assault rifle, an SMG, a shotgun, two different kinds of sniper rifles, and an RPG. So the guns are definitely not unique, but they DO feel...good, for lack of a better description? I never felt like the weapons were weak or lacked kick like I do in some shooters. Enemies also react well to being shot; you can shoot off legs to force them to crawl, shoot off arms so they can't use weapons, and shoot off heads so they begin fighting against their own side.\n\nOne weapon feature worth mentioning is the main character's assault rifle's shock burst feature. It can be used to disable and knockback all of the robotic enemies (every single enemy is robotic except for one boss fight) and can be recharged from battery pickups the enemies drop. I didn't find myself using that often except against bosses; the range on the burst is fairly short compared to your normal rifle range and getting that close to a horde of enemies is a rather bad idea. On the topic of bosses, there are MANY of them, and most of them are fun to fight against (with the exception of the gorilla robot boss that you fight twice who is nothing but a gigantic pain in the ♥♥♥, and the transforming mech motorcycle which is nothing but an HP sink).\n\nThe game features an upgradable weapon system, not only for the main assault rifle but also for the weapons of your teammates. I'll go ahead and say that upgrading your allies' weapons is completely useless; you won't always be able to use your teammate of choice and most of their usefulness isn't in their firepower: it's in reviving you when you get downed and acting as a temporary decoy. The other upgrading system is the nanomachine system. Each character has a 2x3 grid on which to place dots (representing nanomachines) of various shapes. Most of them just increase health/defense/health regeneration/melee power, but there are exceptions, like Faye's nanomachines to increase her sniping accuracy. Several characters also have nanomachines that allow them to carry more revival medkits (I recommend these since, as I said, a large part of their usefulness is in reviving you when you get downed).\n\nNow, about teammates...throughout most of the game you are allowed to create a squad of 3 characters (the main character + 2 teammates of your choice) from a selection of 4-5 teammates. Big Bo uses an assault rifle and is fairly tanky, Charlie uses an SMG, Rachael uses a shotgun and explosives, Faye uses a sniper rifle, and Cain uses a machine pistol and frequent melee (and is also, in my experience, the tankiest character). In battle you can give them orders, which they may or may not follow based on their current trust in you, which brings us to the trust system.\n\nCharacters in your party can gain or lose trust in you several ways. The most common way to gain trust is simply to do exceptionally well in battle; not only will they compliment you during the battle itself (and gain trust immediately), but it also creates a chance for them to open a dialogue with you after battle and gain even MORE trust. Several times throughout the 6 chapters characters will also stop you in hallways (or in other non-combat areas like elevators) and start a story-based dialogue there wherein they ask you questions. You can respond affirmatively/helpfully (almost always the "correct" choice to gain trust) or negatively/sarcastically (which almost universally loses trust). Shooting teammates of course drops their trust in you (which is quite annoying when they run right in front of you as you're shooting), and reviving them during battle gains their trust. The last (and in my experience least common) way to gain experience is to listen to their suggestions/orders during combat (for instance, if someone tells you to throw a grenade and you do so, you'll generally gain some trust from that person).\n\nThe trust system is important not so much from the fact that teammates will more likely follow your orders (I can count on one hand the number of times I actually issued orders as it wasn't typically necessary or even useful) but from the fact that it IMPACTS YOUR ENDING. Yes, this game has multiple endings and they are based, from what I can tell, ENTIRELY off of the level of trust your comrades have in you. This is somewhat of a sore point for me, because there is no indication in the game that for roughly half of the playtime you're FORCED into using two specific characters and therefore any time spent with those characters before the (roughly) halfway point is useless and should instead be spent gaining trust with other teammates. I'll go ahead and say it here: it's probably in your best interest to use Charlie and Rachael as soon as you get them because you won't be seeing them for a long, long time afterwards, and their trust in you is no less important (but consequently harder to get) because of it.\n\nLastly, the story...it's actually quite good. And I'm not saying that in comparison to other shooters; I mean it's actually a fairly entertaining story period. Not only is it entertaining, but it also touches on fairly important topics about artificial intelligence, artificial life, robotics, etc. Cutscenes do tend to drag on a little long, in my opinion, but it's nowhere near the absurdity of, say, MGS4, and the characters are all entertaining enough and decent-to-great voice actors (with the exception of Shindo. Holy ♥♥♥♥, that is one of the worst voice actors I have EVER heard).\n\nSide note: you can use your microphone in this game to issue orders and converse with teammates. I did not do this. It felt silly. Therefore I can't remark on how useful or accurate the voice recognition is, but I do think it's important to note that the option is there.\n\ntl;dr This game is excellent and I fully advise you play through it. Gameplay is great, story is surprisingly enjoyable and thought-provoking, comrades are not awful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you want to punch in the ♥♥♥♥.","March 24, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The combat is fun, though some boss fights can be kind of b*llsh*t. The combat is really helped by how reactive the robots are to your shots, bullet sponges they are not. It’s really satisfying blowing off a robot’s legs or doing a headshot. The writing is delightfully goofy and the main cast are all likable because of this, like your best buddy Big Bo and the French robot Cain. The mic mechanic is janky as hell, so I’d suggest not using it. You don’t really need it that much anyway because you get loyalty points from your squadmates for just doing well in the game.

The combat (while derivative of other TPS) is solid, and the enemies, the 'robot-gore', and the environments are cool.

But the strongest feature of the game (in my opinion) are the cutscenes. The script is well written and the performances are pitch perfect and committed across the board. More importantly, I can follow the story and am invested in the characters, and I'm enjoying this more and more as it goes on.\n\nI didn't realise that voice-recognition was such a big part of the game, and while it's gimmicky and can be frustrating at times, it is great fun at times to yell 'charge!' at one of your characters and have them respond to the command, throwing themselves into the enemy.\n\nEverything that's great about it certainly makes up for any shortcomings in my opinion.","August 3, 2014","true","8.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Maybe a mediocre game with laughable dialogue and good enough action to keep me interested. Instead, I think I got one of my suprise favorite games this year.\n\nFrom the get-go, you'll realize how similar it is to Gears of War. Even the font looks the same for the HUD. And you'd be partly right. It does cover-based third-person shooting pretty competently. What I really enjoy is the story. Right from the get-go, it establishes the world with its "Hollow Children", and, oddly enough, it feels natural. Being the makers of Yakuza, a franchise well-known for its story, I'm not too suprised. Maybe what sells it to me is the voice acting. They could've sent any old B-Team dubbers to pick this up, but instead we get Grade-A performances from Travis Willingham, Laura Bailey, and Troy Baker. Really, there isn't a person I can pick that was awful. It's kind of jarring that they use Japanese dialogue for the police (Which I enjoyed) but switch him to English when he talks to the party. And Johnny Yong Bosch trying to keep an accent with that was kind of strange, but almost endearing.\n\nBut this is a game, right? You're not here for the story! You want to shoot lots of scrap-heads! And that is also a fantastic time due to the limb system. Having tactics to maybe shoot approaching robots in the legs to slow them down while shooting heads off another group to start infighting makes the fighting unique to the genre. You will fight a lot of the same humanoid bots, but there still is a suprising amount of enemy variety, not to mention the boss fights. I was not expecting so many different boss fights, but they are certainly enjoyable.\n\nOne of the main advertised features of the game was voice commands, but honestly I didn't use them. My microphone is garbage, so that might have had something to do with the game not recognizing anything. You can opt to play without it, and I didn't feel very limited. There's a simple command list for your squad that does it's job. The affection system is interesting, and I was engaged in trying to max out my teammates. That might eventually lead you to min/max that stuff, but I recommend playing it blind the first time to see what outcome you take.\n\nOn a port scale, it looks stunning. I don't know about PC controls because I'm casual scum who plays with a controller, but that in itself was an enjoyable experience. No issues with inputs and all that.\n\nI didn't try multiplayer. I don't even know if the servers are still up at this point, or if it's local like Space Marine. Apologies.\n\nI'm almost a little worried giving this a glowing recommendation. I went in expecting schlock (Which it does feel kind of B-Movie sometimes- in a good way), or an unplayable mess, but I got a really engaging story and really enjoyable gameplay. Pick it up, and decide for yourself.","October 20, 2014","true","26.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Hell yes I do.\n\nPlot - This game's plot is amazing. It's complex, but not to the point where it's convoluted. It's a very enjoyable ride full of twists and turns and one that will keep you thinking. If you're looking for a mindless shooter, this is it. If you're looking for a intriguing and thought-provoking shooter that raises questions of ethics, this is it as well. Stay after the credits! Characters are loveable (talk to them- they feed you small morsels of their background). Bonus points to this game for being genuinely funny! It cracks jokes and comments naturally through conversations; nothing feels forced.\n\nGameplay - This game truly revives the art of grandiose boss fights. Bosses appear frequently, are innovative and unique, appear and are menacing, and most importantly, they're pretty freaking huge. Many will make you go "Holy [censored]!" The gunplay is very fun as well. Each body part of each enemy is destructable, and enemies will adapt to every predicament they're in. There's not a gigantic variety of guns, but you won't even notice; the moment you realize the plethora of ways to fight each battle, you will forget everything else. Assault? Sure. Snipe? Sure. Support? Sure. Turn enemies against each other? Why not? There's quite a bit of replay value here.\n\nSound - A superbly done pumping techno soundtrack. Sure, it might not be too memorable alone, but pair it up with the game and you get some seriously epic battles. Of course there's orchestra arrangements as well, but those are reserved for specific moments. Why didn't they release this beast soundtrack on CD?!\n\nGraphics - Amazing art direction. The graphics look superb. The characters are emotive. Every scene, whether it be gameplay or cutscenes, looks great. The camera angles for cutscenes make them look VERY cinematic. Now, you might be wondering how you're gonna run this if you have a mediocre PC or laptop. Don't worry- this game is surprisingly smooth and easy to run. It runs great on my mediocre laptop, even with the plethora of gigantic explosions and machine parts flying everywhere.\n\nInteraction - You can give commands to your team members just by talking. Yes, I'm serious. This game packs voice recognition software just so you can give commands, respond to questions and comments, etc. If you don't feel like talking, you can turn it off and use button controls instead. No problem! Depending on how you respond, your relationship with your teammates can either bloom or wither (relationships do matter, even in battle). One easy way to lose trust is friendly fire. Don't do it! The trust system is very important, as different levels of trust can cause very different events to carry out!\n\nThe Bad - Not much. Besides teammates being easy to friendly fire and sometimes all up in your personal space, everything plays great!\n\nVerdict - Binary Domain is an amazing game. See it on sale? Grab it. Don't see it on sale? Grab it anyways. I'm sure you won't regret it. I have no idea why this game is so underrated- it's truly a hidden gem.\n\n[9/10]","March 1, 2014","true","12.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I got it on sale, but, after finishing it, I can definitely say I would have gladly paid the $15 it's currently priced at.\n\nTechnically this is a cover-based shooter, but even on the hardest difficulty setting initially available actually using the cover mechanics is usually a suggestion and not a requirement. That's a plus, in my book; I find being forced to take cover every single fight is annoying as hell. That's not to say you'll NEVER have to take cover (although perhaps you can get away with doing so on the easier difficulties), merely that in most of the fights I experienced it was not necessary. This becomes doubly true later on in the game when you've been upgrading your assault rifle to its max stats; once I hit level 5 or so in firepower (out of 6 or 7, I can't remember offhand) I never took cover again except for boss battles.\n\nGunplay is tight. The main character has an assault rifle and a backup pistol (the pistol has infinite ammo) with him at all times, and a third weapon slot that can be used to carry enemy weapons or other pick-ups. I can remember the following weapons: the enemy assault rifle, an SMG, a shotgun, two different kinds of sniper rifles, and an RPG. So the guns are definitely not unique, but they DO feel...good, for lack of a better description? I never felt like the weapons were weak or lacked kick like I do in some shooters. Enemies also react well to being shot; you can shoot off legs to force them to crawl, shoot off arms so they can't use weapons, and shoot off heads so they begin fighting against their own side.\n\nOne weapon feature worth mentioning is the main character's assault rifle's shock burst feature. It can be used to disable and knockback all of the robotic enemies (every single enemy is robotic except for one boss fight) and can be recharged from battery pickups the enemies drop. I didn't find myself using that often except against bosses; the range on the burst is fairly short compared to your normal rifle range and getting that close to a horde of enemies is a rather bad idea. On the topic of bosses, there are MANY of them, and most of them are fun to fight against (with the exception of the gorilla robot boss that you fight twice who is nothing but a gigantic pain in the ♥♥♥, and the transforming mech motorcycle which is nothing but an HP sink).\n\nThe game features an upgradable weapon system, not only for the main assault rifle but also for the weapons of your teammates. I'll go ahead and say that upgrading your allies' weapons is completely useless; you won't always be able to use your teammate of choice and most of their usefulness isn't in their firepower: it's in reviving you when you get downed and acting as a temporary decoy. The other upgrading system is the nanomachine system. Each character has a 2x3 grid on which to place dots (representing nanomachines) of various shapes. Most of them just increase health/defense/health regeneration/melee power, but there are exceptions, like Faye's nanomachines to increase her sniping accuracy. Several characters also have nanomachines that allow them to carry more revival medkits (I recommend these since, as I said, a large part of their usefulness is in reviving you when you get downed).\n\nNow, about teammates...throughout most of the game you are allowed to create a squad of 3 characters (the main character + 2 teammates of your choice) from a selection of 4-5 teammates. Big Bo uses an assault rifle and is fairly tanky, Charlie uses an SMG, Rachael uses a shotgun and explosives, Faye uses a sniper rifle, and Cain uses a machine pistol and frequent melee (and is also, in my experience, the tankiest character). In battle you can give them orders, which they may or may not follow based on their current trust in you, which brings us to the trust system.\n\nCharacters in your party can gain or lose trust in you several ways. The most common way to gain trust is simply to do exceptionally well in battle; not only will they compliment you during the battle itself (and gain trust immediately), but it also creates a chance for them to open a dialogue with you after battle and gain even MORE trust. Several times throughout the 6 chapters characters will also stop you in hallways (or in other non-combat areas like elevators) and start a story-based dialogue there wherein they ask you questions. You can respond affirmatively/helpfully (almost always the "correct" choice to gain trust) or negatively/sarcastically (which almost universally loses trust). Shooting teammates of course drops their trust in you (which is quite annoying when they run right in front of you as you're shooting), and reviving them during battle gains their trust. The last (and in my experience least common) way to gain experience is to listen to their suggestions/orders during combat (for instance, if someone tells you to throw a grenade and you do so, you'll generally gain some trust from that person).\n\nThe trust system is important not so much from the fact that teammates will more likely follow your orders (I can count on one hand the number of times I actually issued orders as it wasn't typically necessary or even useful) but from the fact that it IMPACTS YOUR ENDING. Yes, this game has multiple endings and they are based, from what I can tell, ENTIRELY off of the level of trust your comrades have in you. This is somewhat of a sore point for me, because there is no indication in the game that for roughly half of the playtime you're FORCED into using two specific characters and therefore any time spent with those characters before the (roughly) halfway point is useless and should instead be spent gaining trust with other teammates. I'll go ahead and say it here: it's probably in your best interest to use Charlie and Rachael as soon as you get them because you won't be seeing them for a long, long time afterwards, and their trust in you is no less important (but consequently harder to get) because of it.\n\nLastly, the story...it's actually quite good. And I'm not saying that in comparison to other shooters; I mean it's actually a fairly entertaining story period. Not only is it entertaining, but it also touches on fairly important topics about artificial intelligence, artificial life, robotics, etc. Cutscenes do tend to drag on a little long, in my opinion, but it's nowhere near the absurdity of, say, MGS4, and the characters are all entertaining enough and decent-to-great voice actors (with the exception of Shindo. Holy ♥♥♥♥, that is one of the worst voice actors I have EVER heard).\n\nSide note: you can use your microphone in this game to issue orders and converse with teammates. I did not do this. It felt silly. Therefore I can't remark on how useful or accurate the voice recognition is, but I do think it's important to note that the option is there.\n\ntl;dr This game is excellent and I fully advise you play through it. Gameplay is great, story is surprisingly enjoyable and thought-provoking, comrades are not awful ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s you want to punch in the ♥♥♥♥.","March 24, 2015","true","11.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NATESOR/recommended/203750/","NATESOR","NATESOR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NATESOR/","401 products in account","First things first.\nThis game has the most atrocious mouse "acceleration" I've ever encountered.  It's actually a negative acceleration.  So it moves faster the faster you move the mouse, up to a point, and then it moves slower.  It's the most unnatural and awkward control I've ever experienced in a shooter.  You will be over-adjusting or under-adjusting your aim constantly.\n\nThis alone might be a deal-breaker for some people.  After playing through the whole campaign I was able to aim pretty well but still wasn't "used" to it.  I wasn't able to find a way to disable this "feature".\n\n\nThis game is silly.\nMostly in a good way.  The term "over the top" really wasn't in the developer's vocabulary.  So, this is pretty awesome for ridiculous boss fights and mayhem.  Some of which made me reminiscent of old school Contra games.  One thing that is obvious though is that some set pieces are stolen directly from other games/movies.  The biggest offenders being a canal sequence with a helicopter dropping mines on you (HL2).  And a transformer chasing you that was directly ripped from Revenge of the Fallen.  And a musical piece that is a carbon copy of Mona Lisa overdrive from Matrix 2.  Combat with the stock enemies is fun.  Getting headshots especially satisfying.  The tactical "commands" you can give your squadmates are limited, and there were a few instances where they were very much in the way.  That said, they do actually kill enemies, which is a big step up from most companion AI in a lot of shooters (which is sad to say).  The microphone command feature just plain did not work for me.  It may have helped with immersion if it had, but it didn't.\n\n\nCharacters are very much on the nose racial and national stereotypes cranked to 11.  The one black character in the game had Left 4 Dead's Coach's facial model directly ripped from that game (Possibly the same actor was used... but why use such an iconic face?)  and even has a line about hating stairs...  Direct reference to L4D2's intro movie.  Expect a non-stop stream of "aww hell naw"s from him.  Americans, insistently  referred to as "Yanks or Yankees", are loud, horny, aggressive, dumb, arrogant, religious and cocky.  Apply suitable stereotypes to British, French and less so to Japanese and Chinese characters...  You get the idea.  If I were suppose to take this game seriously, then this might be borderline offensive, or at least eye-rollingly distracting.  But since everything about this game is decidedly not serious, then it actually adds to the "charm" of the experience.\n\n\nThe silliness of everything meant that the potentially deep philosophical issues of machine consciousness and all the moral implications that come along with that were only superficially examined.  This is kind of a let down, but if it did turn too cerebral, it would have clashed pretty violently with the tone of the gameplay/characters.\n\n\nOverall it was a fun ride, marred mainly by poor control issues.\n\n8.5/10","May 17, 2015","true","13.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Mood","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Anitude/","940 products in account","I recommend this for the highly entertaining cutscenes and dialogue in the game. It's basically just a real cool movie.\nDepending on how well you build the "trust meter" with your teammates via doing well in the game and giving proper responses to them, the story changes slightly. Slightly being whether or not certain characters die and characters who do not have a high enough trust level aren't specifically the ones that may or may not die later in the game. Despite all this though the main story doesn't seem to change.\n\nI can't really give the actual cover-based third-person shooter part much credit since it's pretty basic, at least as soon as I changed the default looking sensitivity for the controller to a higher level since it was so slow during critical moments and increasing the FoV a bit.\nThe default key bindings for the keyboard & mouse controls felt very weird and I pretty much had to change a whole lot of them to something that looks more natural for a shooter. It doesn't really help that the controller's bindings can't be changed either. It ALSO doesn't really help that ONE button/key is the roll, hide behind cover, sprint, AND climb over cover button. The game then likes to mistake me wanting to climb a ladder to rolling instead and frustrating me further.\nThe shooty shoot part is very basic; hide behind cover & shoot at baddies. You've got partners that you can give orders to and depending on the situation they can either go with what you tell them or not. The AI for your partners aren't exactly smart either since every now and again they'll like to run in front of you while you're firing at baddies then when you hit them because of that they'll blame you for shooting at them and then your trust level will go down with them. Game's got recharging health and when you take enough damage you go into a sort of last-stand kind of thing where you can crawl around and shoot with your pistol before time takes your life to a mission failure status. You can either recover yourself from the last stand thing with a medkit if you have at least one OR you can ask one of your partners to help you out of it. Half the time though I found that they'll be idiots and keep shooting at the enemies instead of going with their agreement to help you out of dying status. The last stand thing takes a long time to actually kill you too unless a baddie helps speed that up.\nSpecific robot body parts can be shot off for better or worse. If you shoot a leg off of a basic robot it will start to crawl. Shoot its firing arm it will stop firing. However if you shoot one's head off it will attack the other robots instead of you. If it takes enough overall damage no matter where it was shot it dies. There are enemies, generally bigger, that don't follow this rule and you either have to just hit certain weak spots or shoot them anywhere until they go down.\nThere's a pretty basic upgrade system where you spend points or whatever it was called to upgrade yours and/or your partners' weapons and stats (faster aiming, defense up, etc.) though you have to find a shop to do that but they're pretty all around throughout the entire game. The further you go ino the game the better and more pricier the upgrades will be.\n\nBasic shooter but cool to watch the cutscenes which you can probably just do on YouTube or something.","February 13, 2015","true","17.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The combat is fun, though some boss fights can be kind of b*llsh*t. The combat is really helped by how reactive the robots are to your shots, bullet sponges they are not. It’s really satisfying blowing off a robot’s legs or doing a headshot. The writing is delightfully goofy and the main cast are all likable because of this, like your best buddy Big Bo and the French robot Cain. The mic mechanic is janky as hell, so I’d suggest not using it. You don’t really need it that much anyway because you get loyalty points from your squadmates for just doing well in the game.

The game also looks great, and the design is fantastic as well - the cityscape is wonderful to look at and really feels like a great blend of sci-fi futurism and gritty realism, and the character models are detailed and instantly recognisable. But the strongest feature of the game (in my opinion) are the cutscenes. The script is well written and the performances are pitch perfect and committed across the board. More importantly, I can follow the story and am invested in the characters, and I'm enjoying this more and more as it goes on.\n\nI didn't realise that voice-recognition was such a big part of the game, and while it's gimmicky and can be frustrating at times, it is great fun at times to yell 'charge!' at one of your characters and have them respond to the command, throwing themselves into the enemy.\n\nEverything that's great about it certainly makes up for any shortcomings in my opinion.","August 3, 2014","true","8.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Apparently on account of this being a PC port, the setup mechanism leaves much to be desired; the main setup appears to not be accessible in game, you have to quit the game and start the configuration utility to remap a key or make any video changes (the original key mappings are unusual for PC gaming).   The graphics look good on max settings though the game is not that well optimized; I had to force the game to run in SLI by choosing AFR2 in Nvidia settings, I also chose multi-core rendering and disabled vsync in favor of gsync (this helped a lot).  It's on sale as I write this for $4.00 -- the game and all the DLC -- so far, it's worth it.

It has a feel of you being part of a unique squad of GI Joes. It has the background storyline similar to Terminator, it has the combat feel of Gears of War mixed with Metal Gear, and it has the team building aspects of Mass Effect.\n\nThe game is quite linear and feels like an Action Movie that you are a major part of. There are choices you can make in the game that change what happens in the scenes. I hear there are more than one ending in the game, but the ending I got looked real enough to be the best. I'll probably play through more to see if I can get the worst ending.\n\nNow if you use the Voice Recognition System it is a little bit buggy. I found it best to use a headset with mic to prevent background noise from messing it up. Being able to say things in combat like Fire, Cover Me, Fall Back, Need Assitance, Blitz, Charge, Yes, No, Affirmative was truly amazing. During combat if you fall you go into a last stand with your pistol and a teammate will ask if you need assistance and if you say yes they will try to make it to you but it's not their main priority; I only say yes if I don't have a medkit on me. Also you can talk to any team mate by saying their name while the voice com is on. Like even if they aren't on your current team and it's funny cause they will always tell you to focus on your current objective. The background noise of my surround sound system was being picked up by my microphone and catching words of the dialogue and the characters thought I was saying things I wasn't even saying which made me think of the headset idea which was a better way in playing the game.\n\nI liked using my Xbox360 controller but to each their own. It doesn't tell you the buttons of the xbox controller but it will give you the keyboard commands for the action moments. I just memorized what each button was on the keyboard and in my head I would press it on the Xbox360 controller. It was more fun for me to play it on that.\n\nThe loyalty system reminds me of Mass Effect but way better. You have the between combat down time to create dialogue to improve their characters loyalty. In combat is the main bonus of this though. In combat if you shoot your teammate they lose loyalty, but you can also praise them for covering you, tell them they did a good job at the last thing they did and you will build a relationship with these NPCs like they were actual team mates. The loyalty system also improves the team mates that are currently on your team in combat when you take out more than one enemy using a grenade, bosonic blast, rocket, or using an environmental explosion. Your active team mates loyalty also improves if you melee kill or one shot kill the enemy during combat situations too. The loyalty system determines if they obey you in combat or try to do their own thing. I had one person hate me at first because I kept shooting them when they got in the way, but instead using the Voice Recognition System with a headset every time they got in the way I would tell them to Fall Back and Cover Me and praise them for doing a Good Job or Nice Work and now they are one of my most trusted team mates.\n\nThe storyline draws you in and keeps you there. There are twists and turns, there are unique situations that are amazing. One team mate is full of surprises, you will see what I mean when you play, but they are my favorite so far.\n\nThe enemies are different. They are robots that each have a weakness. Some are color coded to show you the way they will attack. Each boss has a unique way of dying and you listen to your team mates or try to analyze the weakness of each from fighting the boss. After fighting a few bosses you will be able to figure out what some of the other bosses weak points are. Each boss has a unique feel to it, but they are all well made.\n\nIt's not always combat, combat, combat. It has some scenes you play your character through that made it feel like an old James Bond movie just set in the future, which is funny because one part in the game they mention James Bond and the character being called it doesn't know who James Bond is, but another character does.\n\nThere is character progression. Each character has a unique weapon that is a part of their character class even the main character. That weapon can be upgraded at kiosks around the game. Each character also can be outfitted with nanobots that can improve the character from healing, health total, defense, reload time, grenade number, health kit number.\n\nOther weapons. In the game almost all enemies except bosses drop weapons you can pickup and use. These weapons can range from shotguns, to smgs, to assault rifles, to sniper rifles, to chain guns. You can also find guns laying around. You carry your pistol, your main gun, a grenade type there are several, and a second gun that you can find. Chain Guns and the Stinger Missle are Heavy guns and don't require you to drop a secondary weapon and are fun to use. You can use some Gun Mounts you find throughout the game. The grenade types you can use are Frag, Remote Detonation, Spiked/Sticky grenades, EMP, and Holographic Decoys are what I have found so far.\n\nI beat the main story in less than 11 hours. I haven't tried multiplayer either or even know if the multiplayer works. I do recommend this game to anyone that likes those types of games and movies. It has it's own unique feel and I believe everyone should try it at least once.","May 9","true","11.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/doctordingo/recommended/203750/","doctordingo","Dr. Dingo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/doctordingo/","132 products in account","An overall solid game. For an obviously Japanese production, it wasn't too bad.\n\nPros:+Robots. Holy ♥♥♥♥, these are some of the most awesome robots I've ever seen. If there is one thing I admire about the Japanese, it's their ability to completely give reason and logic the middle finger and do what they want. And this time it actually paid off.\n\n+Gunplay. Guns felt good to use and had decent animations, but variety was lacking. Each robot has multiple layers to it's libs and body, meaning dismemberment and the animations to back it up. Shooting the legs will force them to crawl, destroying the right arm will make them pick up a gun with their left, and destroying their head will send them into a frenzy.\n\n+Storyline. A few cliches here and there, but in the end it was a thrilling story with more than it's fair share of plot twists. Even if it was pushing a heavy-handed political agenda.\n\n+Animations. Big plus here, the animations are very good in and out of cutscenes.\n\n+Camera. Cutscenes and in-game camera are done incredibly well. Some of the best of what I've seen from this genre.\n\n+-Characters. I love most and hate a few. Given it's Japanese origins, characters are incredibly cliche. Male characters are all buff and wear thick armor, but a few missions in and the game goes out of it's way to oversexualise the introduction of an Asian sniper donning a skin-tight combat outfit thing. Yeah, because I've never seen the "sexy sniper" character before, right? Her whole character is so cringe-worthy that I actually like the tom-boy Pointman female character that is introduced in a much more believable fashion in the same mission. Ending on a positive note, every character has their own personality and way that they handle things, which is interesting and sometimes humorous.\n\n+-Trust/Relationship System. Squad members trust you more if you agree with what you say (usually) and distrust you if you harm them or insult them in communication. The relationship part is downright bad. You could tell it was coming from a mile away (and hated the idea from the beginning), but in standard Japanese cliche fashion, the skintight sniper falls for the strong and brash soldier. Go figure, right?\n\n+Art style. Sorry for all you anime fans, but this game lacks your standard anime conventions (which is probably the main reason I even considered picking the game up). You can tell it's a Japanese production, but it's art style is realistic and believable.\n\nCons:-+Voice Acting. It was actually really hard to put this in the cons section instead of the pros section, but all in all the voice acting is lacking. At times the voice can articulate genuine emotions that can really make the moment, especially the main character. The majority of other characters sound like they're just reading off a piece of paper, while with minor characters it sounds like they didn't even try.\n\n-Controls. The controls are pretty hit and miss. In events where the 'w' and 's' key are to be used, it will display the whole 'wasd' layout as if there are more options than there really are. When only the 'a' and 'd' keys are used, it displays the '[' and the ']' keys instead. What? And to top it off, when the LMB is to be used, it will display the 'm' key.\n\n-Voice Control. This would be incredible if it worked. In theory, you should be able to say certain words and the game will use them to talk to characters and issue commands. In reality, the whole feature is busted and ineffective. But it can be disabled, so it's really no big deal.\n\nOverall7/10\nBinary Domain is definitely a game worth playing more than once. With multiple endings, character interaction, and a nice combat system, the game is sure to deliver to those looking for a sci fi TPS.","February 14","true","13.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

If there is one thing I admire about the Japanese, it's their ability to completely give reason and logic the middle finger and do what they want. And this time it actually paid off.\n\n+Gunplay. Guns felt good to use and had decent animations, but variety was lacking. Each robot has multiple layers to it's libs and body, meaning dismemberment and the animations to back it up. Shooting the legs will force them to crawl, destroying the right arm will make them pick up a gun with their left, and destroying their head will send them into a frenzy.\n\n+Storyline. A few cliches here and there, but in the end it was a thrilling story with more than it's fair share of plot twists. Even if it was pushing a heavy-handed political agenda.\n\n+Animations. Big plus here, the animations are very good in and out of cutscenes.\n\n+Camera. Cutscenes and in-game camera are done incredibly well. Some of the best of what I've seen from this genre.\n\n+-Characters. I love most and hate a few. Given it's Japanese origins, characters are incredibly cliche. Male characters are all buff and wear thick armor, but a few missions in and the game goes out of it's way to oversexualise the introduction of an Asian sniper donning a skin-tight combat outfit thing. Yeah, because I've never seen the "sexy sniper" character before, right? Her whole character is so cringe-worthy that I actually like the tom-boy Pointman female character that is introduced in a much more believable fashion in the same mission. Ending on a positive note, every character has their own personality and way that they handle things, which is interesting and sometimes humorous.\n\n+-Trust/Relationship System. Squad members trust you more if you agree with what you say (usually) and distrust you if you harm them or insult them in communication. The relationship part is downright bad. You could tell it was coming from a mile away (and hated the idea from the beginning), but in standard Japanese cliche fashion, the skintight sniper falls for the strong and brash soldier. Go figure, right?\n\n+Art style. Sorry for all you anime fans, but this game lacks your standard anime conventions (which is probably the main reason I even considered picking the game up). You can tell it's a Japanese production, but it's art style is realistic and believable.\n\nCons:-+Voice Acting. It was actually really hard to put this in the cons section instead of the pros section, but all in all the voice acting is lacking. At times the voice can articulate genuine emotions that can really make the moment, especially the main character. The majority of other characters sound like they're just reading off a piece of paper, while with minor characters it sounds like they didn't even try.\n\n-Controls. The controls are pretty hit and miss. In events where the 'w' and 's' key are to be used, it will display the whole 'wasd' layout as if there are more options than there really are. When only the 'a' and 'd' keys are used, it displays the '[' and the ']' keys instead. What? And to top it off, when the LMB is to be used, it will display the 'm' key.\n\n-Voice Control. This would be incredible if it worked. In theory, you should be able to say certain words and the game will use them to talk to characters and issue commands. In reality, the whole feature is busted and ineffective. But it can be disabled, so it's really no big deal.\n\nOverall7/10\nBinary Domain is definitely a game worth playing more than once. With multiple endings, character interaction, and a nice combat system, the game is sure to deliver to those looking for a sci fi TPS.","February 14","true","13.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The world as we know it have changed in some matters. There are robots in use for common tasks (e.g. ecurity, police, secretary). Other than that, because of the climat changes the water level rose which resulted in massive floods which was unfortuante for many countries, like Japan.\nThe members of Rust Crew - a global task-force created by the International Robotics Technology Association are covertly dispatched to Tokyo. Their objective is to investigate reports of Amada Corporation's developement of human-like robots.\nThis mission is a follow-up for the event that took place 10 days before which confirmed the existance of Hollow Children (that's how these robots are called). One of them showed up in Detroid's facility of Bergen Corporation - the current monopolist in robot industry.\nThe interactive part begins on the Japan's capital oustkirts, where the player is acquainted with Dan (playable character) and Bo - the Yankee part of Rust Crew.\nAfter a brief warm-up with the controlling scheme our buds are beeing spotted and atacked by robots patrolling this area. So much for stealth operation, from there there's only dynamic action.\nThere's gonna be a lot of robots in different forms ans sizes. For dealing with them Dan is equipped with few weapons and granades.\nAs You might expect from third person shooter the further progress will result encountering stronger enemies. To make it possible to survive them, there are upgrades for each character and for their primary weapons.\nYou'll also often use covers. The same goes for the enemies, except the bosses. Heavy metal beasts doesn't need to hide and requires more firepower to take them out.\nSo, from what I described You might think it's like Gears of War, right? That's correct, although there are some things that makes this title being not recommended in my eyes.\nWhile the combat is entertaining (although a bit flawed, because of companions a.l.), the graphics is still good and the whole concept of robots in disguise is great I don't like the execution. Why is that? Let me explain my point of view.\nEndlessly shooting becomes boring after some time. It would be nice to have more variety in gameplay.\nThe Rust Crew dialogues are at least medicore. Some lines are used too often. Surprisingly the voice acting is good.\nThe voice command system – the problem with recognizing words is not a big deal, but there should be a possibility to make responds from assigned buttons.\nMy biggest issue is that this world deserves a better, deeper game with more variety in gameplay. You see, when I saw trailer for the first time I was like – damn, dis gon b gud. I've been expecting Matrix mixed with Terminator. The more time I spend with Binary Domain, the more I realized I got Enter the Matrix. Similar in level of disappointment.\nOther than that the game is fine, so if you don't have high hopes – buy it and have fun. It's worth it's price.\nIf You are interested in multiplayer then check the community – there are still a few people who wants to play online.","November 29, 2015","false","13.1"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","9","18","0","0"

This port feels unintuitive to my PC gamer side, and slightly clunky to my 360-player side. Besides the iffy controls and binding options, there's a companion command system that uses your microphone; speak to command. A good idea in theory, but the constant clacking of my keyboard is enough to keep the AI constantly complaining about my mumbling or spontaneously run to their deaths. This is exacerbated by a lack of press-to-talk and a dependence on this system to keep morale high. All of this is AFTER tweaking and optimizing my mic settings.\nUnrelated is SEGA's use of LAST decade's Big-Book-of-Tropes, with a cocky protag, "exotic" love interest, and ..."slight" racial and societal stereotyping.

They marketed shooting waves of enemies as "coop" ? Console versions had multiplayer campaign so where was it on pc? Problems porting? If there was a coop option on pc port it was very well hidden or opened through single player campaign, but we werent thrilled enough to actually play the sp very long.\n\nPerhaps the worst controls I've seen. We had as much fun with this multiplayer as sticking pins under the finger nails. The 60mm costant zoom-lens game camera makes me nauseous.\n\nIf you enjoyed Colonial Marines, you will enjoy this game.\n\nSingle Player:\nThe single player is better, the akward controls made it feel like a big effort for enjoyment though. You can find good bits under all the clumsy action, where voice recognition doesnt work as its supposed to, like nice dialog and robots that loose limbs in the action. It all has a feel of something created for left handed, and being right handed you just try to adapt if you catch my drift.\n\n\nVoice recognition worked about 50% for me in sp. The game was free for me and still not worth playing, and still made me angry enough to write this review. If I had paid for this I would have to ask for a refund.\n\nThis game has fans though, and many like this game it seems. Here's one that definitely doesn't. To me the game setting is unattractive shallow scifi.\n\nI highly recommend one tries the demo first and see where you land.","March 6","false","1.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I wanted to like this game, I really did, becasue it's a cyberpunk shooter. But this game won't allow me. First off, there's no reload button. If you want to reload, you have to empty out what you've got. Secondly, the setup window is way too large, and can't be resized, so if you have a low-resolution monitor, you're screwed as far as setting up goes. Nextly, a lot of the times it tells you to press a key on Keyboard, it tells you the wrong key, or doesn't even know itself. The lowest sensitivity is a bit too fast, but can be gotten used to. I'm just glad I didn't pay for this game (Thanks to the Make War Not Love promotion SEGA did), and I feel bad for anyone who did.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/agent86/recommended/203750/","agent86","agent86","http://steamcommunity.com/id/agent86/","477 products in account","Product received for free\n\nBinary Domain is a halfway decent 3rd person shooter with a LOT of rough edges and weird bits.  I got it for free from a Sega promotion, and I would have been ♥♥♥♥♥♥ if I'd paid any actual money for it.\n\nThe shooter aspects of the game are fine, nothing spectacular but competently executed.  I shot a lot of robots in the junk; can't complain about that.  The boss fights are pretty fun, although they have a tendency to stunlock you in weird ways.  The main character's assault rifle is upgradeable, and I was shredding robot limbs like leafy greens on a Food Network show by the end.  There were one or two "puzzle moments" where I had to use the gun's "bosonic charge" or whatever to break barrels that weren't having any of this "bullet" business.\n\nThere's some squad tactics and such, but this is a mess.  There's a voice command feature that is a neat gimmick for about thirty seconds, as those things are wont to be.  My squadmates rarely did anything useful, and at LEAST once per encounter they decided that standing between me and the enemy was a smart thing to do.  If I get good kills, they compliment me, with the same phrase ad nauseum.  All of them are just-this-side-of-racist caricatures of stereotypical nationalities.  The French robot in particular stopped just short of going "oh hoh hoh" at the end of every phrase.  The dialog is pretty bad, and it's delivered pretty poorly to boot.   The audio in cutscenes is poorly balanced, with the dialog being drowned out by the music.\n\nThe plot is... convoluted, full of holes, and becomes utter garbage in the last act.  I caught bits and pieces of it, at one point they were talking about having sex with robots, there was a cutscene where I swear a dude was feeling up a rack of servers, and in another part there was a literal triple cross.  A character changed sides and then changed sides again within the span of about 2 minutes.\n\nBinary Domain is also a pretty awful console port.  The mouse and keyboard controls are okay for the most part, but they're totally busted in several sequences involving fixed guns and a "tank" sequence I hit at one point.  I was throwing my mouse across the pad 5-10 times to get my character to turn 90 degrees in any direction.   The gamepad controls might be better, but it didn't work with my Xbox One controller at all.  Trying to move the camera just made it spin in circles.  Often times, the button prompts were maddeningly nonspecific, telling me to press a mouse button but not which one, or just showing a "[_]" icon instead of a key.\n\nSo it's a halfway decent shooter with a lot of worthless experimental elements, terrible AI, an overly convoluted story, and it's a bad port of a console game.  Metal Gear Solid fans will love it!","May 26","false","18.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While it's not limiting, it is quite challenging because Sega thinks "Normal" difficulty is the equivalent to the hardest ♥♥♥♥ing difficulty for any other game at times. There are definitely some areas that need improvement, such as team AI and map layouts. At times the game can get frustrating, especially on boss battles because you're thrown into the fray usually without any heads up on what to do because they liked to have the game cutscenes and actual gameplay smoothly transition. Your team members often walk in the line of fire and get shot by you, causing them to distrust you(although later this doesn't really matter much because you get plenty of opportunities to regain it). However, aside from a few minor, yet aggravating details, this is a fun game to play more for the story than the gameplay itself. It gets repetitive after the first 1/3 of the game with the exception of boss battles slightly, however as I said this is a game you play for the story and not the actual gameplay itself.\n\n\nIn short, grab it when it's on sale, go for a quick playthrough for the story and enjoy one of Sega's few games outside of Sonic!","November 5, 2014","true","11.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

While it's not limiting, it is quite challenging because Sega thinks "Normal" difficulty is the equivalent to the hardest ♥♥♥♥ing difficulty for any other game at times. There are definitely some areas that need improvement, such as team AI and map layouts. At times the game can get frustrating, especially on boss battles because you're thrown into the fray usually without any heads up on what to do because they liked to have the game cutscenes and actual gameplay smoothly transition. Your team members often walk in the line of fire and get shot by you, causing them to distrust you(although later this doesn't really matter much because you get plenty of opportunities to regain it). However, aside from a few minor, yet aggravating details, this is a fun game to play more for the story than the gameplay itself. It gets repetitive after the first 1/3 of the game with the exception of boss battles slightly, however as I said this is a game you play for the story and not the actual gameplay itself.\n\n\nIn short, grab it when it's on sale, go for a quick playthrough for the story and enjoy one of Sega's few games outside of Sonic!","November 5, 2014","true","11.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmstewart/recommended/203750/","dmstewart","DMStewart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dmstewart/","267 products in account","This game is exactly what it claims to be and nothing more; something that is sort of refreshing nowadays since the marketing of games hardly ever matches the reality. I tend to not prefer 3rd person shooters because the controls on a keyboard always seem to be a little odd. And that oddness is present here but not as extreme as others Ive played. The quarkiness is actually extremely mild and barely affects game play. Certain mouse movements are really sensitive but ocne you get used to the controls the game  is exactly what I expected.\n\nWhile this isnt a scream of a game it has some really great attributes. Sega tends to have quite a few cut scenes with amazing graphics. On Binary Domain, some of the cut scenes rival some of the most popular games currently being released. The other half of the cut scenes are just ok graphically speaking and a few are a little annoying because they seem unecessary. There are many times where you get a short cut scene and then have to go back to the game to do something as simple as walk down a hallway or pathway and do nothing more before triggering another mediocre cut scene. I dont know why they designed the game this way.\n\nAnother annoyance is your team mates say the same things over and over again and frequently. Its a minor annoyance but they couldve just reduced the frequency of the NPC commentary and most of what they said would go unnoticed. Also, the "secret" datapads look like they do any many other games and are so easy to find that its actually hard to miss them. Since the game is totally linear all you have to do when following the path is look for a small extension of the hallway, staircase, etc and walk over there...theres your secret datapad, every time.\n\nNow for the good stuff...\n\nOn each level/section you can select which team mates you want to bring with you based on their skills and how far along youve been able to upgrade their skills. Which brings me to my second pro of this game, the player and NPC (non-playable character) upgrades. You never seem to have enough $ to upgrade everything and everyone, which is good. This puts you into the position of having to make choices. But when your characters are upgradaed well and you select the right character to accompany you on a mission it does help out a lot, even though most of the responsibility falls on you.\n\nTheres a lot of action i n the game. Thats always a plus for a shooter.\n\nThe default keybindings, while different from every other game, seem to make more sense and be totally fluid for a 3rd person shooter. I actually think other 3rd person shooters would be better off to copy these default keybindings and actions. It took me a little while to adapt but when I did it felt like second nature.\n\nPrice. Ive seen this game go on sale a couple times and when it does it is pretty darn cheap. And that makes this totally worth buying when its on sale. Would I recommend the game, absolutely. If you watch eny preview videos or even game play online, you can easily tell exactly what youre getting. It doesnt break any new ground but it also doesnt lose ground either. Also, keep in mind that the game isnt brand-spanking-new. But to be honest, its hard to tell at times.\n\nOverall 7/10\n\n","September 6, 2014","true","12.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The bosses are very diverse and shooting the robots to bits so their debris fly all over, is quite satisfying! Not to mention the robots are pretty damn cool in the sense that they never really give up, shoot off their arm and they pick up their weapon with the other arm, shoot their legs and they start to crawl towards you and so on.\n\nSo yeah, I highly recommend this game! Only played the single player campaign though, so I can't comment on the multiplayer aspect of it.","May 20, 2012","true","36.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That being said, don't expect any writing worthy of an award. It's bad. It's really bad. You thought it was going to be an existential piece full of questions and morals? Well think again. Either the Japanese really can't write anything without being too comical or cartoonish or it's just simply a parody. In fact, I'm sure it's a parody. While the overall design is really cyberpunk and reminescent of 90s sci-fi (which I personally really do like) albeit wacky in its own right, the extremely poor story overshadows the overall experience and point of it all, eventually turning it into a simplistic shooter. Shoot 'em up. Shoot all the robots, end of story. If you can get past without irritation at the totally pointless dialogue options with no consequence or value whatsoever. Worth your money? If you can spare a buck. I wouldn't hold it high on my wishlist. Then there's the technical side of it all. A really crappy console port with poor support and optimization, broken ''voice support'' and clunky controls and practically no graphical customization, not that it's really necessary anyway.  Do I recommend this game? If I had to choose between Yes and No, I'd go for a ''Eh, whatever.''","June 6, 2014","true","12.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

And the story is epic, one of the coolest stories in a game I've ever gotten to see. And holy ♥♥♥♥ are there a lot of cutscenes: you will be watching cutscenes as much as you get to play, so put your controller in your lap, cross your fingers and wait for the cutscenes to end and let you back in the action. It seems like Resident Evil 6 took all of its inspiration from this game in that regard. But at least they are very well done very cool and fun to watch and the voice acting is mostly pretty good.\n\nBecause of numerous technical issues and this being the worst port I've ever seen control-wise, catch it on sale. Port job is 4/10, otherwise game is easily a 8/10. If you have the awful mouse acceleration problem, use a xbox controller.\n\n-Mouse Control Issue-\nBecause of a horrible mouse acceleration problem that they are not ever going to fix, mouse and keyboard controls are out of the question. It is really bad. So you need to have a xbox 360 controller and only that. Any other controllers you might have issues with. Even then, each time you start the game, white it is running you have to unplug and plug it back in for the controls to work right. Even then you have to set the controller sensitivity to the lowest setting 1, because anything above is too high, so you can minimize the acceleration problem which is STILL there even for the controller but not nearly as bad as the mouse. EVEN THEN!!!... you need to unplug the controller and plug it back in ONLY at the main menu, you cannot do it during gameplay.\n-Voice Commands-\nThe voice commands in the game do not work properly. Most of the time I am saying the command clearly but it will still not register or registers as something else, so you will have to turn off voice commands.","July 2, 2014","true","11.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

This game feals like a console game, that was quickly ported to PC.  But not that little attention to detail was put on the keyboard/mouse, but it surprises me to see xbox controlers bad enough to not be functional.  Additionally, xbox controlers use triggers to look up and down instead of right thumbstick... WHAT?!  My fingers are FAR from precise enough to look up and down without looking WAY too far up and down.  The invasion mode was too simplistic (not too easy, challenge level was OK, but just low variety of enemy, and super small map).  Outside of these things, the game showed a lot of potential.

If this was done by an unknown team or a team known for making mediocre titles which I thought was thanks to written reviews by ♥♥♥♥ websites (I was a baddie back then) and the cover being bland when the game was first released. Then one day while going through wikipedia I learned that the game was made by the team that makes the Yakuza games... I bought the game straight afterwards without thinking. The Yakuza team is apart of SEGA and they have been making the only good series SEGA has published in the last 10 years and I was interested how a team that focuses on making over the top 3D brawlers with huge storylines make a third person shooter let alone while they were making Yakuza 5 which is massive in terms in content and I was shocked on how good Binary Domain is.\nBinary Domain has you fighting against robots in the city of Tokyo as Dan "The Survivor" Marshall, A man that earns that title on the basis he isn't dead and his squad built of a comedy relief American black man named Big Bo, a Chinese sniper named Faye Lee that looks like someone from one of the pornos that Big Bo watches in his spare time, an MI6 soldier named Charlie that complains a lot and British demo expert that I forget the name of because I never brought her in missions and three other characters that I won't spoil.\n\nThe gameplay is standard for the genre besides one thing, since the enemies are robots you can destroy limbs and they will take it in stride for the most part, removal of arms will make them less accurate and make them drop their gun, removal of legs will make them crawl or hop and removal of the head causes the AI to go nuts and makes them attack other robots, headshots also make a nice little ding noise when you do it which I love, also while shooting enemies their armor falls off with sounds of metal clanging on the floor exposing their wires and such. This system and guns being really fun to use make this some of the most fun I've had with a third person shooter in a long time if not shooters in general since the game rewards you with credits if you go balls deep in battles while saying ♥♥♥♥ you to cover(Hence the "" in the word cover in paragraph 1)while blasting bot heads off moving fire away from you so you can do it again and thankfully your health pool isn't small so you can easily do this but you still need to rest every once in a while during battles on harder settings. Since this is a squad based game you AI partners and they are actually really good at what they do, they can kill enemies and protect themselves while following orders given by you thanks to the games voice comm system which I never used so I just used the pre select options from the tab menu, squadmates also have a trust meter which is increased if you perform headshots, melee kills and if you "go balls deep". Trust affects the game's ending if everyone is at max trust which is hard to do on a first playthrough since you have no knowledge on who you might have at different times, don't bother with this until a 2nd playthrough where you know what you'll have.\n\nThere are some other stuff in the game but it's 1am and I've written more about a single video game than my latest english exam about a poem which I looked at for an hour so in conclusion... Binary Domain is good game 9/10 go buy it.","December 28, 2015","true","11.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UmbraDragon/recommended/203750/","UmbraDragon","Umbra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UmbraDragon/","426 products in account","Review:\n\nLet me first start off by saying I went into this game not expecting some groundbreaking experience. I didn't expect expert storywriting, the best acting a voice actor could muster, or some top of the line gameplay. Coming out of it, I can safely confirm this game has none of that. HOWEVER, what it does have is a damn good story, some good gameplay, some good voice acting. Nothing top of the line, but good for what it's worth.\n\nBinary Domain is a 3rd person Tactical cover based shooter. Immediate the whole "cover-based shooter" will send alarms ringing in many people's heads, due to the market being over saturated with it. Despite this pandering to that market, I gotta say it does it pretty damn well. Enemies are intelligent enough to move between cover and use cover responsibly.\n\nTaking place in a futuristic time, Binary Domain feels like it harkens back to the old age of games, where robots could be seen as an enemy. In a market over saturated with zombies and humans that aren't American or British being the enemies, fighting robots is a welcome change. While not original, Binary Domain tackles the robot antagonist in a brilliant way. Like an actual robot, it takes a lot to chip away at them, since they aren't made out of squishy flesh and muscle. Taking off their arms, legs, or even their heads don't get them to just stop. You just gotta keep shooting them till they drop and explode. It gives an old arcade like feel. Not to mention it gives the player different means of tackling situations. Taking out their legs forces them to a crawl, while taking out their arms may limit their aiming, but make them more aggressive. If you have the patience to go for a headshot, they'll lose sensory functions and attack their allies. It makes for fun combat scenarios.\n\nThe story isn't something you will remember for all of time. It's filled with tropes, stereotypes and B Movie schtick... yet it utilizes them all so well to create a well done narrative. The large, muscular african american, the white sports man american, the thinly "attractive" Asian woman, the impatient angry Brit, and so on and so forth. All banning together to take down an evil corporation. Leaving out some spoilers, there are some actual surprising plot twists among this!\n\nDespite all this, there are some setbacks this game suffers that can't be ignored. Your squad's AI are not the brightest, and unless they're told what to do, they barely help you out, and tend to run straight into your line of fire, yelling at you when you shoot them. Speaking of telling them what to do, the tactical side of the game is unfortunately limited more than it should. The voice commands, while an awesome concept, are terrible at recognizing speech. So much so that it's better to just turn them off. The commands you are left with are very limited in scope and don't provide a lot of decision making to the player. So prepare to carry the weight of killing every damn robot on your own. One last complaint that I have, is that the end of the game doesn't give full closure. It leaves it up for a possible sequel, and while I would love to see a sequel, it probably won't happen due to how underrated and overlooked this game is. So you're left with some unanswered questions.\n\nTLDR\nPros:\nPlays on its tropes and stereotypes to create a fun story.\nHas good gameplay\nAmazing action sequences and boss fights.\nRobots. For once not zombies, aliens or people that aren't American.\n\nCons\nVoice communication doesn't work\nCommands are limited\nFriendly AI aren't always the brightest.\n\nAll this aside, I think this game is definately worth the full price tag. 8/10","May 20, 2015","true","9.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's a good break from shooting zombies, terrorists, Nazis and Nazi zombie terrorists. Not saying they're bad, but i feel they're overused. This game boasts some really cool features. Like the voice commands. It's optional for you to use your mic but being able to command your teammates is cool enough. Another feature is the ability to customise your team. You can choose two people to go with you (except for the first chapter, you only have one) out of five.The last feature I want to mention is the trust system. Your teammates can either follow your orders, or say,"Later". As for the story, I never really liked it, and it's pretty short. Took me nine hours to finish it. But this is an action game, so the story's pretty irrelevant when comparing it to the gameplay. Overall, I'd just like to say, this game is horribly underrated. Don't believe me?

The game features an interesting - though definitely not that original *cough*Asimov*coughcough*Galactica*cough* - story that will keep  you playing the game just to see how it turns out, if you're willing to give it a chance.\n\nAdmittedly, when I had first seen this game the cover art always turned me away almost immediately. I don't know what it is about the cartooney cover but it misrepresents a game which frankly has some of the best graphics I've seen for a third person shooter. Certainly better than the Unreal engine used in Gears of War, and maybe on par with Spec Ops The Line, but not as pastel. The graphics are realistic (as far as "last gen" goes) and can be tweaked further with SweetFX to be on par with a lot of other 3ps's like Resident Evil (newer ones) or better. Many of the setpieces make for good eye candy, too, and the boss battles most certainly are something to look at.\n\nThere's an interesting game mechanic that I found both novel, and very annoying until I figured out how to work around it. Before Ryse and it's *sparse* in comparison voice commands, Binary Domain relied very heavily on them. Not of course for anything that important, but for a "relationship" system where you can get along with your AI teammates or ignore them or tell them to shut up, in frequent scenarios where they talk to you and refuse to stop talking to you. In fact, the game refuses to progress until either a response is received, or it times out and the AI teammate just gets negative "relationship" points with you because you were too rude to answer. Unfortunately, the voice communication system  is extremely bad for PC - I've literally  yelled at the microphone "Yes" and it doesn't get it when that is the exact syntax the game says to use.  Fortunately, though, for those who don't want to talk to their computer - you can use the controller or button prompts to substitute the pre-defined answers.\n\nAs for the story, other than saying how it isn't original, it's kind of a troll on the player. You meet all these characters, and most of them either die, or disappear at the end with absolutely no further mention. Unfortunately, one of them happens to be one of the most flavorful characters, too.\n\nA lot of the environment in this game, or at least the way the camera and the controls handle, remind me of Resident Evil. This is another circumstance where I feel like another developer/publisher (really any developer) would be far better suited to do justice to and treat with respect the Biohazard franchise. Yes, BD is a pure shooter and RE should not ever be, but at least if Capcom insists on making it a shooter only they could just contract it out to a different developer.\n\nOther than that, I honestly feel this was one of the most overlooked and underrated games of last generation, and would like it to get a sequel. I highly doubt it ever will, though, and it probably sold less than a million copies.","November 17, 2014","true","44.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

It ceases to become challenging and just "oh wait for the deus ex machina to appear then just do what that says" requiring no thinking from the player other than "shoot what you get told to shoot, follow the AI like a sheep"\n\nMultiplayer co-op is your fairly standard horde mode, though fun with other players it has no scaling for anything less than a 4 man party, meaning that the difficulty vastly depends on how many friends you can summon to your side.\n\nControls wise, im told the game has improoved vastly from its initial badly ported release however you still cannot change your keybindings and the context sensitive buttons are almost hap-hazard in their usage. The control of the player is relatively crisp so long as you stay within the games rather strict boundries, as soon as you try something advanced or not what the developers explicitly wanted you end up with terrible response, unintuitive movement and dodgy camera angles.\n\nAll in all the game is in the "good idea, poor execution" bin.

I'm looking for a solution, but it's absolutely unplayable to some mouse acceleration / smoothing issue. Of course, this is due to it being an exceptionally lazy console to PC port. Had I known this game was a port at all, I probably wouldn't have even bothered. I'll update my review later if I get this game-breaking issue resolved.\n\nUPDATE: The only potential way to disable the mind-jarring, dizzying mouse acceleration is to install a third party program, or to PERMANENTLY change the way your mouse works in Windows using a registry hack. Nice SEGA. Well, this will be the last SEGA game that I buy. If you have a controller and like playing shooters that way, then it is /possibly/ a good game??

Cookie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/juanacookie/","118 products in account","TL;DR\nGameplay: Repetetive cover shooting with annoying sidecharacters with nothing good to offer. Voice recognition doesn't work.\nStory: Went from Interesting to dumb, fast. Over-the-top sequences made the game unbearable.\nWriting: Horrible.\nDesign: Nicely designed stages and enemies.\nDidn't bother playing online.\n\nI bought this game during a sale and was reccomended saying this was an underrated game.\nThe Cyberpunk Neo-Tokyo setting had me interested so I thought I'd give it a try\n\nIt was awful. The more I played the game the more I cared less for the game then just wanting it to end.\n\nI learned after installing the game that the game had a mandatory voice system in order to interact with the NPCs, after configuring my microphone I only found that it didn't recognize my speech, so i just outright turned it off.\n\nThe controls are clunky. I fight the controls so many times when they automatically put me against a wall, or when I try to aim, change positions etc.\n\nFighting enemies we're just repetative with slight variations in enemies once in a while. Although ammo was plentiful, enemies we're simply bullet-sponges and just made the pacing bad. Just because the enemies are robots doesn't excuse this fact.\n\nBosses we're hit or miss. mostly miss. Some bosses had interesting mechanics but the majority of them we're "Shoot the glowing rainbow weakspot", or "Shoot them until they die"\n\nI didn't bother upgrading weapons and I'm not sure nanomachines we're helpful or not. There was a bad ratio for the amount of money you'd get and how much upgrades and items cost, as money was plentiful, which eventually led me to have about 1mil by endgame.\n\nNext, the AI of your teammates. It was outright bothersome to deal with teammates. They keep repeating the same lines over and over and keep nagging at you and pretty much make you do all the work. Even while I fire at the enemy they just move around and move in front of me as I'm firing and then I get a negative trust indicator blaming me for poorly coded AI.\n\nAlso the "Trust system" or whatever does jack squat. All it does is make it likely that they follow your orders--which they never do regardless of how high the trust does. When saying lines like 'cover me' or 'fire' they seldom ever shoot more than 3 bullets at enemies only letting me take damage. And when you screw up, all they do is complain about how useless you are even though you we're doing all the work. I really wish you could team-kill / have an option to let them die during the game. I only felt unmotivated when having to choose partners. I just wished I could play the whole game solo.\n\nThe characters we're all so unlikeable in that there was nothing reddeming about them after all the nagging, complaining, useless dialog, boring backstories and unfunny quips. There are parts in the game where you have to rescue other memberss and I really wished there was an option to let them die and press on.\n\nThe music was really bland and overused throughout the game. Voice clips we're reused every single conflict and it only annoyed me every time I had to stop and defeat the enemies.\n\nThe story started with an interesting concept but go really poorly written as it went along. Unfortunatly talking about it would lead to spoilers, but all the "twists" while somewhat surprisng, it's the surprise you never asked for.\nAlso they blatantly rip off some parts of the story from other games.\nThe progression of the characters also had some really "jump-the-shark" moments with some really poorly written escapes and way too many plot holes and questionable events.\n\nThe only thing I really enjoyed we're the designs of bosses and the outside city. Nothing redeeming for the rest of the game whatsoever.","February 28, 2014","false","10.3"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","27","3","11","0","0"

First the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ control scheme. If you wish to change the control scheme, you have to stop playing, quit the game to Steam, use the configuration utility to make the changes, then restart the game. It becomes more infuriating because Binary Domain uses a horrible checkpoint system and does not allow manual saving. Having used the cover system in Gears of War and Spec Ops: The Line, Binary Domain handles game play mechanics like a dump truck. The game's AI is terrible, often during a fire fight, squad members will run in front of you while your trying to blast away at baddies. There are the quick time events like Sega's Die Hard Arcade, which was okay for an arcade game in 1994, but not for a console game in 2012. Voice commands often do not get recognized by the game, and is nothing more than a gimmick for the Xbox 360.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, I really did, and had it come out 3 years earlier then I could say, "okay they were trying something new." Like a lot of other games by Sega, this game could have been really cool, but was released half baked. 4 out 10 and only because I got it on sale.","May 22, 2015","false","8.1"," 3 of 11 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","3","11","0","0"

You have to slot them in like the tank upgrades in Valkyria Chronicles. (Where exactly are they getting shoved into?)\n\nJapan's insane take on Gears of War. Most of the fun of this game is in laughing at it. You can use voice commands to order your team around, but I could only get the game to recognize maybe a third of what I said, so I had to use the manual command option instead. Your initial partner is a ridiculous version of the Black Heavy Weapons Guy stereotype. The game's campaign is SINGLE PLAYER ONLY - the "co-op" Steam mentions is a "Horde" mode. Japan decided to add some dating sim BS to this shooter, so your AI partners have a "trust" level that drops when you inevitably shoot them because they walk into your line of fire like the idiots they are. Oh, and your character has the same voice as Cyril from Archer, but so far he hasn't yelled "Suppressing fire!!!"\n\nYour AI partners are TOTAL IDIOTS. There's a boss fight against a mecha spider where you have to blast off its leg armor with rockets. Does the chick who carries around a rocket launcher (who you chose for the team SPECIFICALLY SO SHE COULD HELP YOU BY SHOOTING ROCKETS AT ARMORED ENEMIES LIKE THIS) bust out her RPG and shoot rockets at it? NO, SHE JUST ♥♥♥♥♥ES AT YOU AND BOGARTS THE HEALTH PACKS. Okay, so maybe the devs didn't want to let the AI do the whole fight for you, so at least the AI partners are good for distracting the boss while you do the real work, right? NO! THE IDIOTS FOLLOW YOU AROUND AND HIDE BEHIND THE SAME COVER AS YOU, SO GUESS WHERE THE SPIDER SHOOTS ITS MISSILES AT?! Why is there this stupid broken voice command system but there's no "SPREAD OUT!" or "GET THE HELL AWAY FROM ME YOU USELESS DEATH MAGNET!" Do you see the cover art for this game, where the player character is carrying the USELESS A.I. partner (who got shot in his stupid British ear) on his back so he can't even shoot his main gun? That is EXACTLY what the partners feel like in this game - dead weight.\n\nYour player character is forced to always keep his starting assault rifle that has an energy shotgun attached. You can carry one additional gun (and a handgun) but most of the other guns are just bullet hoses that are very similar to your starting gun. The guns are all ugly, box and grey. They kind of look like the artist slapped them together out of basic shapes in a modeling program over an afternoon. You can shoot robots' legs off to leave them crawling, and destroying one's head will make it attack other robots, but (even using a mouse) aiming isn't stable enough for headshots to be practical most of the time. I thought it might be easier with the sniper rifle (none of the other guns zoom in at all) but it's really floaty and bad.\n\nThis is such a bad console port that I got stuck on a part where I was told that I had to blast an obstacle with my energy shotgun using the "M" key, but that didn't work. Turns out that "M" really meant to click the mousewheel... how was I supposed to figure that out?! Even once you know what button does what, the keyboard controls are awkward. The button prompts are MUCH more obvious if you use a 360 controller to play (because of the way aiming works, you won't miss out much from the accuracy of a mouse) but although you can switch to using a controller on the fly, you have to quit the game and reconfigure the game in the launch menu to get the appropriate button prompts. Lame.\n\nI only started playing this game for Playfire credit.

I said\nI was so wrong.\nBefore you read any further let me say that i've already forgotten the names of most characters\nso, we start with the introduction of the game:\n"You are a generic american soldier who, with the help of teams from France, UK, China and the help from your bff, is tasked with infiltrating the Japanese government (who are now isolationists [again]) in order to investigate the company of the second biggest manufacturer of robots in the world (Amano? Amaso? something like that) because he is suspect of developing a type of robot that can pass itself as a human (like replicants, cool) and the impersonation is so uncanny even the robots themselves are not aware of it.\n"I like the sound of that" I said\nSo, after you are given this briefing you start the game on what looks to be a stealth mission in order to infiltrate Japan.\nThat sounds completely reasonable and justified, and i completely got in the mood for it to be a steath/action shooter, but that feeling wouldn't last for long because Binary Domain quickly takes the first opportunity to focus solely in being an action shooter.\n--Examples of gameplay are as follows:\nWe have to go to that place SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT\nOh my god we have to go through the sewers but lets not do that silently at all! Let's not put a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ silencer into our weapons so that enemies can't hear us!\nSo we got though the sewers! you know what's a good idea? Let's all go come out of the sewers on plain sigh! WHERE EVERYONE CAN SEE US!! MARVELOUS!! THAT'S EXACTLY HOW COVERT OPS ARE DONE, TOTALLY!!\nSo this game that could have been a really good experience turns out being a mediocre generic action game with unnecesary gameplay mechanics and a forced and clichéd "romance" between male mc and strong but sensible female.\nWhat unnecesary gameplay mechanics, you say? Well, i talk about the whole voice command thing of course!\n"This game has a voice recognition software that helps you issue commands for your team, so this really inmerses the player and makes a game more tactical-based"---The guy who sells this mechanic\n"Wow, that sounds awesome"---Everyone who hears about it for the first time\n"It really its awesome and enjoyable"---Said no one ever\nIf this mechanic could have been just turned off and have no repercussions on the game then i'd have overlooked it, but even if you don't want to have a microphone on you everytime you play this game, after you disable this function you still have to bring an special menu everytime you want to issue an order or answer a question from one of your teammates.\nThe biggest issue is that the questions are moronic (and make me feel i'm in an episode of dora the explorer) and the reason they exist is moronic as well.\n"Ugh I'm dying here dude, can you give me a spare medkit?"\n"What? you don't like that i said that i don't like puppies so you're leaving me to die? WELP! i guess i deserved that!"\nThat doesn't even make sense!\n--Example question by teammate\nWow dawg, that was really a harsh fight, what do you think about it?\nA).-No problem\nB).-Damn\nC).-...\nSeriouly.\nAs a final note, i couldn't get my microphone to work with the game, only detected 2 of all of the commands (it was an old mic though).\nBut i don't really worry about it, i mean, it's not like i wanted to use the mic to tell my in-game team that i don't want to date a fifteen year old (THAT IS AN ACTUAL QUESTION, LIKE, WHAT THE HELL MAN)","July 3, 2014","false","4.7"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","9","24","0","0"

Nothing works well -- not the boring combat, not the derivative futuristic setting, not the unceasing boss fights, nothing nada zip. The AI is brick-wall stupid, and team members will only follow the most basic commands until they lose complete focus and decide to take cover or launch straight into the enemy instead. The audio commands don't work properly, and getting the game to recognize what you're trying to say is nearly impossible without a high-end microphone. The Trust System adds absolutely nothing to the overall story arch besides making it harder to boss the AI team members around. Gamepad controls don't map properly. The setting is filled with nothing but constant grey-on-grey environments, and the characters are the kinds of shallow stereotypes that are so particular to Japanese games. Even worse, Binary Domain suffers from that horrible console affliction known as QTE-itis -- quicktime events and cut scenes dominate a exasperatingly large part of the game, and real playable action is rare.\n\nI'm boggled as to why such a mediocre game gets such good user reviews. It's as if people here have never played anything other than Gears of War or Azura's Wrath or other games of that ilk. Variety is the spice of life, folks, and the beauty about playing on an actual computer is that you have literally dozens of genres to choose from. Skip Binary Domain and play something better.","February 17, 2014","false","4.8"," 9 of 24 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","9","24","0","0"

Also I don't really like cover-based third-person shooters.

NOPE!\nPerfect example of an excellent game completely destroyed by lack of proper treatment during porting to PC. Mouse acceleration is abysmal and unbearable and joypad detection fails (buttons wrongly detected even with Xbox 360\ncontroller emulator). Can you play this game - sure. Can you enjoy it? No.\n\nIt doesn't matter that this game has different dialogue lines that depend on your answers, voice control over friendly AI. It doesn't matter that you have nice guns, satysfying shooting, customization for both you and friendly AI, good models of enemies and friendlies, nano-machines (modifications), 2 AI to help you during missions (out of 6  accessible), big and diversified levels, iteresting bosses (even though I hate bosses with passion), a few difficulty levels.\nIt doesn't matter that graphics is nice, levels are long and environment is rich in details, effects are great, animations are awesome. Things around and characters sound good and convincing (even though they are cheesy as this is japanese game).\n\nYou just can't enjoy this game as controlling your character is pure pain and you want to it to go away. Save your money, time and frustration as you will be disappointed by the fact porting team didn't give proper treatment to this gem.

It doesn't do anything that hasn't already been done better before.\n\nShallow, dull characterization and a plot that can't decide if it wants to be serious (and typically luddite "humanoid robots are immoral") or goofy all wrapped in some fairly generic third-person shooter gameplay that cribs thoroughly from other games.\n\nIt sure throws in just about everything too in the hopes that a decent game will emerge: you've got the dismemberment mechanic from Dead Space (but without the concept of alternate weak spots that made it interesting), a light RPG system of character customization, selectible companions (with a "loyalty" system that will influence some of the cut-scenes and the ending), some on-rails shooting sections, and most awkwardly of all a speech-recognition system (that never worked for me) for controlling the AI companions and answering occasional questions. Except while they were throwing all of this together they never thought about whether it improved the game or added anything. So it just feels very mashed together.\n\nThe levels are deeply linear and the settings aren't anything new or exceptional (slums, factories, sewers, offices, etc.).\n\nThe story sort of tries, but again, the mood whiplashes between goofy and overly serious and I found myself sympathizing far more with the "villains" than the dumb, meathead protagonist. The later plot twists range from obvious to ludicrous.\n\nThe shooting itself is... decent, but it's unexceptional. If you absolutely have to play a third-person shooter there's nothing technically wrong with it and it will provide about 15 hours of generic gameplay, but you can almost certainly do better.","January 6, 2014","false","14.5"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

That's an A, B, and C choice. Hell, if the game could detect overt sarcasm too it could have secured a place in my black little heart as a guilty pleasure. But no, nothing so entertaining or satisfying here.\n\nEven without this boondoogle, the game's controls are somewhere between subpar and plain bad. During the (unskippable) tutorial at the start that has your elite covert infiltrator shooting roadsigns until they vanish, the tutorial unhelpfully provides instructions to the player to press the incorrect key, or even shows a symbol not vaguely resembling anything on my keyboard. It's a new twist on the worst kind of console-to-PC port; and its compounded by the charmless exposition teammate who switches between flattering the player and bemoaning like moody teenager whenever you aren't responding with wide-eyed positivity in a gamist pursuit of operant conditioning your teammate.\n\nHow the hell anyone thought a game about gun violence and infiltration would benefit from reassuring teammate's feelings and constant flow killing chitchat I don't have a clue.\n\nTo try and get around this mess, you may think going to the pause menu and swotting up on the controls would get you past this problem; but controls cannot be configured within the game and require an external configuration too.\n\nUltimately I'm glad I only got this as part of a game bundle and so mercifully I was not suckered into paying anything near full price. I strongly urge you to avoid spending your hard earned on this; to those who still feel this is a game they must play buy a second hand copy for the 360 or PS3 and spare yourself the full spectacle of tutorial so bad I quit it to do chores.","March 19, 2014","false","0.4"," 6 of 18 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","6","18","0","0"

They should be shot.\n\nWhat's more fun is that after trying to play with my controller, it wouldn't let me switch the input back to M&K.

I've played it before on a buddy's 360 and it's certainly entertaining (pretty standard Japanese game that appears to be attempting to poke fun at the Gears of War franchise...at least, I think they're trying to make fun of it) but this control nonsense is ridiculous.

A future where robots can look and act just like humans, to the point that the robots themselves actually believe they are alive. Such robots are outlawed, a violation of global law, but someone is producing them, and it‘s your job to find out who it is, stop them, and destroy every robot you find on your way. But how do you know who these robots are? They could be all round you. Who can you trust? Can you even be sure you aren’t one? It’s a setting ripe for suspicion, deep contemplation into the nature of life, and gripping moral choices. And the story and general aesthetic were absolutely brilliant!\n\nThat said, the implementation could have been a whole lot better. The game turned out to be VERY linear, which is not necessarily a bad thing (Spec Ops: The Line was very linear, and I consider it to be a masterpiece), but something about this game felt slightly off. Maybe it was because of the unholy amount of inescapable boss fights. Maybe it was that the suspicion of this world didn’t seem as prevalent as it could or should have been. Or maybe it was that any potential tough choices (and there were a lot) were made for you in the cut-scenes, leaving you powerless to the whim and fancy of the game.\n\nThe trust mechanic, which could have had so much potential, turned out to be little more than shoot the enemy to gain trust with your squad, and shoot your squad to lose that trust (which was easy to do, since they seem to have a habit of running in front of you in combat). You can also talk to your squad and choosing the right response will net you some more trust, but you are never able to intervene or choose sides when your squad has a argument, so it becomes just a matter of just agreeing with whoever you’re currently talking to, even if it goes against what you‘ve just told another squad-mate. And the more trust you have with your squad, the better an ending you get.\n\nBut the absolute biggest problem was the inconsistent characterization. I couldn’t ever really take the protagonist seriously, which is a shame because he had some deep revelations and some truly heart-wrenching moments. But the rest of the time he was making sarcastic and juvenile wise-crack comments in a attempt to...to…I don’t really know why. It did absolutely nothing for the story or the endearment of his character, the only thing it did accomplish was to tear me out of my immersion almost every time he opened his mouth. The other characters were slightly better, but they weren’t immune to the bad writing either, and there were times when they all devolved to nothing more than stereotypes; Big Beefy African-American guy with a machine gun, hot Asian sniper, no-nonsense British agent, etc.\n\nDo I recommend it? That’s a hard one. For most people I would say no, there are tons of better games out there more worthy of you‘re time. But for anyone (like me) that enjoys seeing what the medium potentially could be capable of doing, and wants to play through a game that almost got there, then yes, play it. Because while this review may sound extremely negative, I actually did have some good moments with this game. It was good, it just wasn’t all that it could have been, which is sad, because it could have been incredible!","November 25, 2013","false","14.2"," 3 of 13 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","3","13","0","0"

Yes you have the option to turn this feature off but that doesn't keep the game from still requiring you to use the feature, you just turned off your mic and the game still waits for you to respond.\n\nThis game has so much potential but it gets bogged down by the jankey voice command mechanic.

That's right, you're supposed to yell commands at your AI teammate. As much as breathing into your microphone is going to make him go "Huh?", "What?", "You were saying?" and, in my case, lowering the sensitivity made it impossible to issue commands.\n\nIt boggles the mind what the developers, or whomever made this incredibly daft decision, were thinking. Let's base our game on some half-working gimmick that doesn't add to the immersion but rather takes away from it, as you are painfully aware of yourself awkwardly uttering commands. Not only that, but the voice recognition layer seem to have problems with understanding accents, which is an added frustration if you don't speak with a neutral north-east American accent.","October 15, 2014","false","0.5"," 2 of 18 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","2","18","0","0"

Has got a decent story, at least three good characters (one of the characters I didn't care about AT ALL) and fun gameplay.\n\nIn the future, the world has been flooded due to global warming and since most of us humans died during the flooding, robots are created to be used to rebuild the cities. The concerns about the economy of the world lead to the NEW Geneva Convention... and one of the clauses of that is the banning of research that could pass human in intelligence. But the story really begins when the headquarter of the Bergen company gets attacked by an android, sent from their rivals - Amada. Due to that attack, you - Dan Marshall - and your Rust Crew gets sent to Japan to bring Amada in for questioning... and the ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan... so to speak.\n\nI had fun with this title and it's a shame there won't be a sequel since the ending is close to a cliffhanger.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AKA_Hell/recommended/203750/","AKA_Hell","Mr Demon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AKA_Hell/","175 products in account","I Highly reccomend this game. This game is under rated.\n\nJust to mention, this game is not rich with history, however does have a good backstory, and creates a amazing base for potential future development of story/universe, if this was to pass onto other games or any movie.\n\nFor a game that is 2 years old, it holds decent graphics where it deserves it, very much fun gameplay and mostly revolves around squad leading. This game is entertaining and fun, while exciting and requiring you to play differently with each enemy you encounter, and the locations will change going through the stages, providing different types of hazards along the way, placing you in different scenarios as well, that can also affect the type of squad member following you. Won't go into further detail.\n\nThe backstory is a good base, and key points in the story you can sometimes predict the plot twists and sometimes be surprised by them. This game doesn't really have much features that would affect the story, to possibly change the ending BUT I COULD BE WRONG, I am not 100% on this. In the end, it will have created a base for future development of a great universe, but as much as it appears it will not continue, it would still be amazing.\n\nFor a game that isn't over the top in graphics, features, or complex backstory/history, it does it all very well, and very entertaining to the look and theme of this game, and some point keeps true to a few things, while throwing in some "ecentric" things in for entertainment purposes. There are some surrealism points, however these are limited and an important one is story related, however it is very entertaining in regards to its possibility.\n\nPros:\n- Not a Crazy game (aka overly on graphics, features, complexity, etc)\n- Fun gameplay (ie shooting off the arms of robots, shooting off the head so they only attack their friendlies, because i dont know?!)\n- Not stupidly hard, even on hard, while staying reasonably hard (if that makes sense)\n- Robots\n- AIs\n- LOTS of robots\n- Backstory\n- Enemy AI is good\n- Squad "trust" system... yeah only adding this in, because there are sequences where you may chat with members of your squad, socialising\n- Upgrading (need I explain?)\n- ITS A CRAZY GAME, BUT IN A GOOD WAY (eg Big spider robot, hopping on one foot, that would clearly be unable to take all that weight)\n\nCons:\n- A straight forward game, mostly going loud, But you ARE american....*cough* *cough*\n- Voice commands (Don't do it)\n- It isn't a hard to understand story, for those who want speculations and theories\n- No complex history, basic future, a bit to do with global warming\n- No co-op (In all honesty it doesnt need it, but would of been kinda cool)\n- WHY IS THIS GAME SO UNDERRATED AND IT DOESNT HAVE A SEQUEL OR A MOVIE?!?!?!\n\nWith the cons, this is a shooter, third person, isnt hard to play, but again, its not too hard, so people wouldn't get bragging rights, that and people would be like "what is that game??", plus the voice commands are bad, 2012 bad, like trying to say "xbox on" bad, and i used to own one. This game isnt overly complex, however it is well written, and well made, graphics, gameplay and mechanics, but dont expect to hack robots, or do some complex ♥♥♥♥, and there is no skills, but there is the fact you can blow off a robot's head and it will attack your enemies, as well as a chaff grenade.\n\nOverall verdict: NEED TO EXPERIENCE THIS ONCE IN LIFETIME.\n\nWhy? Because it ventures the borders of humanity and robotics, possibilities and theories, with an interesting ending, and beautiful potential for a future development of the universe. which it probably wont, because people are idiots.\n\n=)","January 2, 2015","true","10.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a pretty straight-forward cover shooter but being that it's Sega developed, it's kind of an arcade-y ride. Just make sure you TURN OFF the voice commands because that functionality is broken at worst and inconsistent at best. You can use TAB to talk to your teammates instead. Also you can't configure many options in the game itself, you have to lauch the configuration tool separately, which, again, you should definitely do first. It's not worth it for more than $10, but if you manage to get it on a good sale and you have nothing else to play and like shooters then give it a shot.

One more try!" and I´m glad I gave the game a second chance!\n\nThe game itself is a pretty basic 3rd Person cover shooter like Gears of War or Spec Ops The Line, but I fired more bullets in one playthrough than in the 4 Gears games and Spec Ops together and I never killed (or destroyed) so many enemys in one playthrough of a game, except for the serious sam games of course.\n\nUnlike the other famous Covershooters you can interact with your comrades and they respond to your actions and behavior. Sometimes they ask you a question and if you agree with them the like you and follow your orders or if you ♥♥♥♥ them off by shooting them or say something rude they refuse.\nIn my opionion thats pretty pointless. They always catched a few bullets from me, because they ran in my line of fire. But when you speak with them just agree with everything and it´s okay again.\n\nAnd unlike the other shooters you can upgrade your main rifle with credits you earn by shooting robots. There are so many enemys that you can easily afford all the upgrades and get an overpowered rifle. At first you need to shoot different body parts to bring a robot down, because your rifle is very weak. At about half of the game I destroyed enemy groups within seconds and even bossfights were over in minutes. But shooting different bodyparts has also different effects. Shoot their legs and they can only crawl anymore, shoot their head and they start to attack each other.\nAt the beginning this was very helpful, but like I said, at half of the game you have a very strong rifle.\n\nYou can also upgrade the guns of your comrades, but I never did that except for the last part of the game when I couldn´t upgrade my rifle anymore but I didn´t have the feeling that my comrades fight more effective after that.\nSometimes you find upgrades for your character and the comrades too. I found some upgrades just at the beginning and after that stopped looking.\n\nThe game is very easy. I started on survivor difficulty and I never had any problems with any part of the game.\n\nThe story is pretty good. It may not win a price, but thanks to it´s likeable characters it´s better than you´re average shooter story and it keeps you going.\n\nOverall Binary Domain is a very fun shooter and I enjoyed playing it for about 10 hours.","August 23, 2014","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game's setting is in a near-future Japan where a fictional corporation, the Amada corporation, is illegally (illegal due to a Geneva convention clause) creating near-human-like robots called "Hollow Children". You, Dan and your team from around the world i.e. a "Rust Crew" are sent in to arrest Amada. This new Japan's government is very totalitarian where the rich elite rule and the whole country is securely guarded by humans and robots alike (compliments from Amada) so be prepared for action.\n\nThe gameplay offers a lot of enemy and scenario variety- from taking on hordes of robot infantries to fighting a huge killing machine in a large open space to being in a moving vehicle where robots are lining up as target practice. While it's deceivingly just a well-done arcade-y cover'n'shoot kind of game, there is one feature that sets it apart- teamwork. The game allows you to interact with your AI companions either through a microphone, albeit mediocre, or a selection of options you can choose with keys or buttons. It adds a layer of interest to the game and it's nice to actually seeing your teammates actually interacting with the game instead of sitting there like Christmas ornaments (I'm looking at you Call of Duty).\n\nI originally had played the demo on the PS3 awhile ago but never wanted to pay for new price. Finally bought this while on sale for $3; it's easily worth that and honestly even paying full price would be satisfying. There are some minor weird annoyances- running down stairs = hopping, instances where boss enemies immobilize you again right after healing, teammates not healing you when you're immobilized, but it's worth it for the solid arcade action it offers. Either plug in a 360 controller or use your mouse and KB and play this bad boy!","August 3, 2014","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought this game for $4, so at that price, yes I would recommend it. However, I would not recommend it if it were purchased for more than $8.\n\nHere is the good: The graphics. They are mostly excellent. Sometimes the rendering shows more fake looking reflections and glare but it is not that bad. Overall the textures and polygon count are quite high. You have a limited arsenal, but you can swap out some of your seconday guns and grenedes as you find them. I watch a lot of anime and for some reason this whole game feels like something I had watched previously, or some combination of them. It is like a combination of Vexille, Appleseed, Ghost in the Shell and various others, along with a sort of terminator vibe. The game plot is different from many others I have played in the past few years. The voice acting is very good and Dan's voice is done by a guy who does lots of anime.\n\nHere is the not so good: Clunky controls. There is a button you can use to hide behind a wall or barrier, but no way to crouch. No button to prone or sprint either. Also, you cannot change these controls on the fly. You have to exit the game and use a seprate configuration program to change it. A bit of a pain. The configuration seems 'light' in the audio aspect - one master control for all volume but not for effects, voices, music, etc. You also cannot set the 'enter' key to examine. There is also a weird mouse acceleration thing going on - I move with my mouse and it jerks the view really quick. No way to adjust this which seems strange for a shooter. In some parts of the game (car chase scene I think) it is turned off and your turn rate seems incredibly slow. The AI - specifically your teammates, seems incredibly stupid. Here I am sniping or shooting away and my teammates run right into my line of fire, and then complain to me for hitting them. There is also the whole team interaction speech thing. Sometimes your mate starts yapping and asks "you handled yourself really good back there" or something like that. One response may be "no problem". Another time I was told we need to protect a teammate and the reponses available were "Sh!t" "Damn it" or "I got it" It just seems like the dialogue is a little strange. The whole chatting with your team feels pretty unnecessary during the downtime. It may help in some cases during battle to make them charge or fall back, but thats it. Honestly, I rarely, if ever, used it outside of the required times I had to respond. There are also other cutscenes that require user input to finish, and if you fail, you die and have to redo. I would much rather just  relax for a minute and watch the screen instead. There is also some sort of loyalty meter going on. This game is trying too hard to give you RPG aspects that are completely unnecessary. Your actions (not killing enough, friendly fire) or responding in a bad way could lower this. Just seems tacked on. You also get points/credits on killing robots and you can use that to upgrade weapons, supplies and other various things. In conjunction with having multiple teammates and choosing which are in your squad it sort of reminded me of Mass Effect, but a very very light version. Also, there are times when your teamamtes are talking and you for some reason cannot run, and are stuck walking very slowly until they are done. Annoying.\n\nThis game is fun, has great boss battles (when you have teammate AI not doing something stupid) and looks and sounds pretty. However, it is kind of short, and tries too hard to be a shooter RPG when it should have been kept simple. This is also feels like a really bad console port. Some many controls and actions do not feel intuitive. The game has certain aspects I loved, but I ended up nitpicking on so many things that negated much of the good. So like I said, at $4, it was certainly a good buy. Over $8-$10 and I would have felt it was overpriced.","July 25, 2014","true","12.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Spec Ops definitely does it, and a lot of the other games also had various shades of it. In this context, Binary Domain was the perfect refresher. Like Saints Row, this is a game that just wants you to have fun. You're gunna go in, shoot robots to bits for 9 hours, and you aren't going to get guilt tripped into feeling like a horrible person at the end.\n\nI haven't played many of these "Third person cover based shooters" that seem so popular these days, but Binary Domain easily feels the best so far. Getting into cover is a snap, shifting cover is also quick and easy, and the game mixes it up with enough moments where you'll want to run and strafe around slower enemies to keep things fresh. The shooting also feels incredibly satisfying as well, the robots you shoot blow up real nice, and there are various elements like blowing their legs off to send them into a crawl, or decapitating them to cause them to go haywire and shoot at their companions. The level of destruction in this game simply wouldn't work with human enemies, but since you're fighting robots, who cares! Shoot em all!\n\nThe game also has a ton of unique boss fights, the occasional vehicle sequence, and fairly interesting story. It keeps these things all in nice balance, moving briskly from one thing to the next. It's too bad this game wasn't called Contra, it would've sold a lot better.\n\nIf there's one disappointment I had with the game, it's that the story landed with kind of a thud. It has some pretty heavy moments regarding self-aware robots, and if that counts as life, and then takes a hard line kill-em-all stance, which just felt crazy to me. But maybe that's OK, because I sure didn't want to game to start making me question what I was doing Spec Ops style, but it still felt weird for the game to go there, then back off entirely.","February 17, 2013","true","9.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Although combat mechanics are simply adequate, the modular damage system makes for some interesting gameplay, especially during boss fights. The whole "voice command" thing is a bit finicky and quite awkward (Sitting home alone and barking orders at the screen) but fortunately it can easily be turned off for no real loss.\n\nThe story is quite interesting and well told through both gameplay and cut-scenes. The cast is varied (If national stereotypes irk you, beware, I just found it amusing though) and features really nice voice-acting. Also kudos for letting the japanese actually speak japanese! The enviroment deserves special mention, which is easy to miss thanks to rather hectic gameplay, but it is really well designed with a striking contrast between upper and lower Tokyo. I'll certainly try to stop and smell the roses more on my second playthrough.\n\nSo in conclusion, if you're looking for a more story focused TPS with a great character gallery and don't mind that the actual shooting gets to play second fiddle, I'd definitely recommend this, especially if it's on sale. Good for at least two playthroughs in my opinion.","August 7, 2014","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Haven't tried with a Controler yet but I might to see how it plays out. This game how ever had such a great story behind it. I'm a sucker for japanese Animation movies like Appleseed, Vexille and lets throw in Ghost in the Shell. I love my Scifi as much as any one so my reccommendation might be a bit bias. The bottom line is I had fun in the game. Some Boss fights I would get hit,hit,hit then need a revive and when I do I get hit again to need another revive. . . a little annoying but not enough to get me mad or stop playing. I liked the twist they added and the characters development pretty much was good with a bit of bad. The Campaign is a bit short but I burned through this game quickly because I really wanted to beat it. The plot/story is to blame for that. I will say that some of the weapons could have been better. Upgrade feature could use work. Only the main weapon of each character can be upgraded and I would of like my side arm to be upgraded but can't complain too much about it. Also the Trust feature with each character. I had all main character MAX out with Trust and yet I don't know what its really for. I don't know if they do better in combat or what so seem like a dead feature to have in the game. But I don't enjoy as many games as I use to or want to keep playing it all the way through. How ever I really did in fact enjoy this game. Not the best 3rd person game I have ever played but I enjoyed it and got this when it was on sale so I have no buyer remorse. I actually thought when buying this game I would of just have paid for another game that will sit in my list of games unfinished because I didn't enjoy it enough to finish it. This was not the case.\nOne of the biggest things that really kept this game interesting was the Boss fights. Pretty straight forward but no real push over and some times I felt like my attempt to stop/destroy them was not being effective. Not the case but it was sort of a fun feeling to have. Left me on the edge a bit for a few fights. I highly Recommend this to any one who have similar taste in story. Not a long story but I would say worth the buy.(for sure worth the buy if its on sale)","August 10, 2014","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The shooting is extremely satisfying with chunks of metal flying off your robotic foes with each bullet. Enemy behavior changes depending on where you shoot them. Shooting off a leg causes a robot to crawl at you for a close attack while shooting off a robot's head causes it to shoot at friend and foe alike.\n\nOther features such as purchaseable upgrades for your guns, your character, and your allies help enhance the sense of progress through the game. There is trust system in the game that aims to add a sense of depth and connection to your NPC allies. Trust isn't very important to the core gameplay, but having a certain trust level with certain allies does affect your game ending, which adds some replayability.\n\nBinary Domain is a strong 3rd person shooter with a great story, corny writing, and fun characters.\n\n","July 13, 2012","true","10.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

One more try!" and I´m glad I gave the game a second chance!\n\nThe game itself is a pretty basic 3rd Person cover shooter like Gears of War or Spec Ops The Line, but I fired more bullets in one playthrough than in the 4 Gears games and Spec Ops together and I never killed (or destroyed) so many enemys in one playthrough of a game, except for the serious sam games of course.\n\nUnlike the other famous Covershooters you can interact with your comrades and they respond to your actions and behavior. Sometimes they ask you a question and if you agree with them the like you and follow your orders or if you ♥♥♥♥ them off by shooting them or say something rude they refuse.\nIn my opionion thats pretty pointless. They always catched a few bullets from me, because they ran in my line of fire. But when you speak with them just agree with everything and it´s okay again.\n\nAnd unlike the other shooters you can upgrade your main rifle with credits you earn by shooting robots. There are so many enemys that you can easily afford all the upgrades and get an overpowered rifle. At first you need to shoot different body parts to bring a robot down, because your rifle is very weak. At about half of the game I destroyed enemy groups within seconds and even bossfights were over in minutes. But shooting different bodyparts has also different effects. Shoot their legs and they can only crawl anymore, shoot their head and they start to attack each other.\nAt the beginning this was very helpful, but like I said, at half of the game you have a very strong rifle.\n\nYou can also upgrade the guns of your comrades, but I never did that except for the last part of the game when I couldn´t upgrade my rifle anymore but I didn´t have the feeling that my comrades fight more effective after that.\nSometimes you find upgrades for your character and the comrades too. I found some upgrades just at the beginning and after that stopped looking.\n\nThe game is very easy. I started on survivor difficulty and I never had any problems with any part of the game.\n\nThe story is pretty good. It may not win a price, but thanks to it´s likeable characters it´s better than you´re average shooter story and it keeps you going.\n\nOverall Binary Domain is a very fun shooter and I enjoyed playing it for about 10 hours.","August 23, 2014","true","10.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has decent clean graphics, good game play and a few odds and ends though it does have a couple flaws. Its graphics, although they might not be the best, do hold up and look good to me especially in the way that they made things glow and such. even though that may not be its strong point, its gameplay is fairly solid and fun. This is your apocalyptic robot shoot 'em up (which I am very thankful for being a change from the zombies everywhere nowadays). you can destroy the robots piece by piece and limb by limb (headshots make them fight for you too :D) and in my opinion, is pretty awesome. The controls, although slightly different from normal, after taking a bit of time, are easy to use and by almost no means presented difficulty to me. As for the few odds and ends, there is a trust system thrown into the game (and it WILL noticably play out (and in the story line too)) such as if you say something like "cheers" after tearing a few of the scrap-heads apart your party will like you more and will obey your orders more often, or if you shoot them, you will lose trust and they wont listen. another thing they added was voice comands so you can talk to your crew more and give a more diverse order set than using the keyboard. You don't have to worry about micro managing your crew too much though because they can take care of themselves most of the time. As for the down sides, I know some will diagree with me about the graphics, but i figure, as long as they hold, i'm happy, though it isnt anything ground breaking. Also, as I was talking about the trust meter before, every so often my crew's AI would decide to run in front of my open fire, which they then proceeded to yell at me for, but if your team's trust is high enough it shouldnt matter, though sometimes it can make it or break it. over all I think this is a good game and it's under apritiated, though it may not be perfect, i strongly recomend getting it, i even did 2 play throughs. Lastly, (THIS WILL NOT APPEAL TO EVERYONE) the story line seems to be about racism and descrimination, and personaly, i thought it was good, not the best, but good. note: for me the game had a 6-10 hour campaign. P.S. there isnt a multiplayer any more (or at least for me it wasnt working) so dont bother with that (but then again it might just be me).","July 28, 2014","true","21.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/breakfastcompanion/recommended/203750/","breakfastcompanion","Deluxe Breakfast Companion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/breakfastcompanion/","1043 products in account","Binary Domain is a third-person shooter from Sega set in a robot-filled future earth. When the Amada Corporation appears to have violated international law against the creation of realistic, human-like robots, a small squad of elite soldiers are sent to infiltrate Japan to arrest the corp's CEO. The story feels weak and cliched towards the beginning, so for the first few hours the game mostly rides on its gameplay.\n\nAnd what gameplay it is! Binary Domain's combat is the star of the show and is defined by its robotic enemies. Your foes are all loaded with destructible parts that influence behavior as they are destroyed. Blast a robot's shooting arm off? It'll have to pause to reach down and pick his gun back up in his other arm? Remove the legs? Watch the bot slowly crawl along the ground with its arms to get to you. Headshot? It'll start blasting its teammates in confusion. Being able to manipulate the enemies through mutilation enables a variety of great tricks. In an ordinary fight, you'll mostly just aim for headshots, but when you need to move to a new vantage point or rush past enemies, being able to disable them with shots to the arms or a spray at the legs is great fun and quite useful.\n\nThe bosses are similarly destructible, featuring tons of parts for you to shoot through as you slowly dismantle them from gargantuans into scrap heaps. The bosses are all memorable and are real showstoppers, usually being both massive and cleverly designed.\n\nEven outside the destructible enemies and great bosses, the game's design is quite impressive. You have a variety of squad members you can choose to bring with you, and who you bring and how you communicate with them will influence both their respect for you and which ending of the game you receive. Vending stations provide a way to upgrade you and your squadmates' weapons. Gameplay gets broken up with little minigame sections like driving boats through absurdly spacious sewers.  There's even an option to communicate with your squad members using voice recognition, rather than menu responses. Token multiplayer is also included (but I didn't even check it, probably dead by now).\n\nIf there are any real deficiencies in the game, they are in the voice recognition and gun upgrades. The voice recognition isn't really bad, per se, it's just not nearly as efficient as using the menu responses. It doesn't help that talking to a computer program feels hopelessly awkward. As for the upgrades, the unfortunate reality is that your main rifle will, after a few hours, become absurdly good. So good that you'll actively try to avoid using other weapons in favor of it.\n\nSo the core gameplay is great other than a few minor quibbles, which is great, because it helps carry you through far enough to start appreciating the story. I felt that Binary Domain's plot started off weak. The characters felt cliched and being dumped into this weird almost-post-apocalyptic-but-not-quite universe didn't help.  However, after a little bit of time with the game, I began to really warm to my squadmates and found the wild plot twists very engaging. It's good science fiction that presents an interesting world with good characters and a fun plot that gives you a moment to reflect on on themes dealing with the nature of humanity.\n\nSo whether you want a good story or just want to turn hundreds of robots into piles of metallic shavings, Binary Domain will not disappoint.","September 23, 2014","true","8.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game's setting is in a near-future Japan where a fictional corporation, the Amada corporation, is illegally (illegal due to a Geneva convention clause) creating near-human-like robots called "Hollow Children". You, Dan and your team from around the world i.e. a "Rust Crew" are sent in to arrest Amada. This new Japan's government is very totalitarian where the rich elite rule and the whole country is securely guarded by humans and robots alike (compliments from Amada) so be prepared for action.\n\nThe gameplay offers a lot of enemy and scenario variety- from taking on hordes of robot infantries to fighting a huge killing machine in a large open space to being in a moving vehicle where robots are lining up as target practice. While it's deceivingly just a well-done arcade-y cover'n'shoot kind of game, there is one feature that sets it apart- teamwork. The game allows you to interact with your AI companions either through a microphone, albeit mediocre, or a selection of options you can choose with keys or buttons. It adds a layer of interest to the game and it's nice to actually seeing your teammates actually interacting with the game instead of sitting there like Christmas ornaments (I'm looking at you Call of Duty).\n\nI originally had played the demo on the PS3 awhile ago but never wanted to pay for new price. Finally bought this while on sale for $3; it's easily worth that and honestly even paying full price would be satisfying. There are some minor weird annoyances- running down stairs = hopping, instances where boss enemies immobilize you again right after healing, teammates not healing you when you're immobilized, but it's worth it for the solid arcade action it offers. Either plug in a 360 controller or use your mouse and KB and play this bad boy!","August 3, 2014","true","12.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The tactical combgat, if you can call it that, was nice, being able to tell your teammates what to do, even though it was a little limited. The shooting was in my opinion very enjoyable in the beginning, and towards the end it turned into a pure power fantasy, it may be because i played on normal and had upgraded my weapon to max in everything though...\nThe setting was nice, and varied, the story very good written, in my opinion, providing some twists towards the end in order to create an epic finale in the story and an epic ending for the game.\n\nI also played a little co-op, which is kind of a hoard mode, where waves of enemies will come at you and your friends. There was a decent enemy variety in it. I have not play the versus mode.\n\nif you ever see this game on sale, dont even hesitate to buy it.
