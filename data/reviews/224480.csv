Just a simple story about one man's plight in the face of fatherly duties and mundane tasks-- which he, of course, finds completely easy and by no means complicated in any way-- and his struggle with living in a world of judgmental peers who obviously harbor envious feeling in regards to his most gentlemanly fashion sense. So many ties! Such fancy hats. And many references to cultural icons that a man who lives on top of the land and never takes off his suit would definitely recognize. Not sure why everyone is so tickled by this video gamery. Maybe they should have called this Totally Human Motor Skills Simulator 2014?)","January 31, 2014","true","9.4"," 1,050 of 1,182 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","050","1","6","14"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rulerofeden/recommended/224480/","rulerofeden","Crazy Diamond","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rulerofeden/","1063 products in account","I feel like it's rare to find a video game that's funny. Not the kind of "funny" that Borderlands 2 tried to be, where the development team ham-fistedly shoved in as many internet memes and pop culture references as possible, devoid of any meaningful context. I'm also not talking about an ostentatious satire of modern Polish political dealings (though if you find one of those, let me know immediately). No, the kind of funny I'm talking about is just chaotic, goofball, slapstick comedy. Not a biting social commentary, no gritty world, and no over-abundance of the color brown. It makes you laugh because it's just straight-up silly.\n\nIt's no surprise, then, that I adore Octodad: Dadliest Catch (what a great subtitle, by the way). Developed by a team of college students, the original Octodad was a humorous concept but something of a technical mess. That's okay, because it was just a school project that they decided to release to the world. Dadliest Catch is the full realization of the inherently comedic ideas: You're an octopus moonlighting as a human man, trying to hide from your human family the fact that you are an octopus. You go about mundane, inconspicuous human activites such as mowing the lawn, making coffee, and grilling hamburgers with the kind of stunning precision one would expect from an octopus. If you're not already sold, then I don't know what to tell you.\n\nThe controls are loose and imprecise in a way that really feels like you're trying to control a bipedal octopus-man, but they're also consistant in a way that keeps the player from feeling any lack of agency over Octodad's actions. The ragdoll physics of Octodad's body only serve to add a level of awkwardness to everything you're trying to do. Within the first five minutes of gameplay, I accidentally found myself completely wrapped around a floor lamp, writhing on the floor like an octopus wrapped about a lamp. I tried to think of a better analogy, but I'm pretty sure you can imagine that situation. I was also laughing hysterically at the ridiculous situation Octodad had gotten himself into.\n\nTechnicallly, this game is pretty impressive. It's very well optimised, with a consistantly high framerate on my admittedly below-average PC. The art style is cartoony and clean, and all of the colors pop like a Technicolor movie. It's a world totally suited to Octodad's wacky hijinks. The non-octopus characters are a pleasant surprise as well: they're caricatures of some modern personality tropes such as the overly cynical journalist or the too-smart-for-her-age daughter. One character I particularly enjoyed was the chef, but I'll refrain from spoiling those moments here.\n\nNow, normally I dislike reference-based humor. I feel like it's never done well, because it's just shoved in your face as if to say, "Look as this! We know about that thing you know about! Aren't we timely/clever? LOOK AT OUR RELEVANCE!" Octodad: Dadliest Catch makes some pretty direct references to other indie games. For example, in the supermarket level, there's a table at the back with a breakfast cereal that is a Minecraft reference. It's not right in your face, and you might even miss it if you look too fast. If you go up and try to grab the block modeled after Minecraft's Creeper enemies, it'll briefly flash and then explode in a small cloud of smoke. It's not subtle, per se, but it's not trying to rub its relevance in your face. I really appreciate that quality, and the entire game is sprinkled with similar little touches like that.\n\nOctodad: Dadliest Catch has been in the spotlight since its huge appearance on stage at the PlayStation 4 conference at E3 2013. Since then, the hype has been steadily growing, all culminating in a final release which absolutely delivers on everything I ever wanted Octodad to be. Young Horses makes an incredible debut with a technically solid, gut-bustingly funny video game. I thoroughly enjoyed my experience with Octodad: Dadliest Catch, and I can't wait to see what's next.","January 30, 2014","true","4.6"," 1,395 of 1,628 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","395","1","0","50"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/224480/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","Octodad is a game about an octopus. But not just any octopus. He's married. He has children. He wears a stylin' suit. He's Octodad! The player will control Octodad as he goes about his "normal" life, undertaking seemingly mundane tasks for his family.\n\nIts sounds very simple, but the controls....the controls make it a huge challenge. And that's where this game shines! The controls make for some hilarious moments, and that's what this game is all about. It's not meant to be serious, but more of a fun, relaxing adventure full of laughs and mishaps. It has a very lighthearted story, and you come to love the brave, fatherly octopus. Don't ask how he had 2 human children though...\n\nThe controls are...well, atrocious. You use the mouse to manipulate his arms and legs. Pressing Spacebar toggles between moving your arms or legs. You press and hold the right mouse button and move the mouse in the direction you want the arm/leg to move. It sounds easier than it really is because the mouse is very sensitive, so a slight move will send his arms/legs everywhere, toppling everything nearby over! Be careful how much commotion you cause, as a bar across the bottom of the screen fills up when you are nearby any people and they see you knocking stuff over. When the bar is full, that's it! Your disguise is blown, and you restart from your last checkpoint. After a little while the player should get used to the sensitivity of the mouse and be able to complete most tasks in a relatively short time...just expect several tries as you go!\n\nIf you liked and enjoyed games such as Surgeon Simulator 2013, Probably Archery, or even Ampu-Tea, you owe it to yourself to give Octodad: Dadliest Catch a try. The antics you will get into is well worth the pricetag.\n\nRecommended!\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","November 1, 2014","true","6.1"," 244 of 275 people (89%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","89","244","275","19","2"

Yes, it's a 3D comic game. Yes, it's colourful. Yes, it's also funny for kids. Yes, the story is far fetched. Yes, the music is cool. Yes, it's not too easy but also not too hard. Yes, it's many hours of hilarious fun. Yes, the physics are good.\n\nBut you know what? The control of Octodad is a blast! YOu have 2 control modes which you switch with the middle mouse button. One is walking ... sometimes sliding ... by pressing left/right mouse for the left/right leg ... erm ... arm. The other mode is just for controling your right arm ... errr ... just another arm. While in control of your legs/arm, you move the mouse to stear it in the 3D room. The controls are really intuitive after you get used to it. Much easier than e.g. in Surgeon SImulator 2013.\n\nOctodad is always in motion - well, it's not that easy to "stay" on 4 arms to somehow hide your appearance in a human trouser. It's a little slimy, slippery and jelly like movement. You can grab/hold things by usiong your vaccuum arm. The arms are also quite elastic and can stretch about twice it's size when holding unmovable things. You can also throw obstacles around. You also swim totally nacked just like a real octopus in the water. And have to solve lots of puzzles and quests.\n\nI bought this game for my children, but it's so much fun, that I had to play it, too.

At it's current price, for what it gives, Octodad: Dadliest Catch is NOT worth it. The game's about an hour and a half long, for $15? Now, if this price ever goes down to, say, $5 or so, this would be an absolute "YES". Octodad is a funny game, with chuckles throughout, the sheer obsurdity of what you can do is always worth a laugh, the silly theme song is great. However, the game feels like it's over before it even starts.\n\nThe last 30 minutes or so of the game are some of the most annoying trial-and-error types of gameplay that I've ever seen. Yes, the controls are bad, I get it. Having to 'sneak' past people is annoying in this, having to walk across a narrow path as fast as you can is also annoying. Instant-death attacks that go through walls and physics objects are also not fun.\n\nBut with that out of the way, everything else in Octodad is extremely fun! The writing is silly enough to work, the subtitled blubs that Octodad gives are rather funny at times. The objectives you're given are fun.\n\nBut that's really all you can say about this. It's just so extremely short. Lower that price to $7.50 or even $10, and I'll change my review accordingly, but at $15 for a regular, non-launch purchase? Not worth it.

I somehow missed the first version of the game (perhaps due to my complete lack of knowledge on the series as is apparent at the start of my video), but going into this game I found myself pleasantly surprised.\n\nWith all the mentions of humour in this game I was kind expecting some hyped up world full of modern pop culture references where I'd need Know Your Meme open up on the other monitor or something, but thankfully we got something a whole lot better than that. This game is funny because it's stupid. Stupid in a good way. The way you control the character, the way he moves, the way he looks, the way you get caught up in a kitchen table and flying around the room in an attempt to make yourself a cup of coffee is most enjoyable.\n\nThe story is great because it is so simple. Who knew outside the world of menial task simulators would you find yourself having fun in a game where you go to the supermarket or mow the lawn? Despite having the ability to take full control of your character, as you learn the ropes of the controls you find a complete unpredictability with how you're going to find yourself next, and it's hilarious. In fact because of the strange and unique way you control the character, I found a sense of achievement when I managed to complete something, then had to laugh at myself for feeling that sense of achievement because I managed to get my character out of a door properly.\n\nThe graphics are lovely and of a very nice quality, it's definitely a nice game to look at. It's simple but cartoony. It performs great and feels well optimized. The controls take some time to get used to but that's half the fun.\n\nIt's a charming and unique game with a hilariously strange character and well worth checking out. Would recommend!","January 30, 2014","true","1.9"," 47 of 54 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","47","54","0","1"

The only catch? you are an octopus. You can't let anyone find out so you must act as human and casual as possible.\nWith fun and goofy controls to control Octodad's tentacles to get by without anyone knowing is definitely great fun, and mixed with a fun storyline with some great dialog, it was a real treat to play. What makes this game even more fantastic is the ability to play co-op with 2 to 4 people with each person controlling a limb or two! This makes for a great couch co-op experience, and greatly adds to the challenge of the game. Hidden ties help you to constantly search and explore, and the wonderful achievements give some extra challenges along the way. A thoroughly enjoyable experience, especially with a partner.\n\nPros:+ Cute storyline\n+ Awesome dialogue (with pretty good voice acting too)\n+ Unique and goofy controls offer a fun and challenging gameplay experience\n+ Solo and co-op up to 4 people\n+ Controller support for a great couch co-op experience\n+ Challenging achievements\n+ Workshop support for player made levels and mods\n+ Well hidden ties to collect every level keep you exploring\n\nCons:- The achievement for dying 100 times in a playthrough can be a little tedious (pretty hard to die 100 times by accident)\n- Overall quite a short story (if you are good at the game), however co-op greatly extends the gameplay experience.\n\nMy Score: 8/10","August 7, 2015","true","20.6"," 36 of 37 people (97%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","97","36","37","3","0"

That is why it's recomented to use ps3 or xbox controller, but sadly, I don't own one. So for the PC people, it's hard and frustrating sometimes to pick up coffe beans, pour some milk, or try to climb up slippery stairs. Some levels are easy, and some hard, but like every level in the game, has some difficulty spickes. And everytime when you just fail to do one simple thing more than 5 times, you just want to conteniue, and then you just randomly do it.\n\nThe look is cartoonish, and it looks pretty. Also the humor is good. And the game has it's moments. So if you like fun cartoonish games with good story, I recomed to buy this. PLUS the DLCs are free, but a bit short.

Neverless it is entertaining resulting in hillarious situations or screenshot moments.\n\nThe story is quite short and only will take a few hours to complete, But it makes up for it in all likeable characters, from your reporter wife who is too dumb to know your a sea creature, the loveable daughter who is the only one with a brain who knows your a sea creature.

It has just four short and one kinda long level, and there's so many more situations they could have put our spineless protagonist in for more hilarity. How does he function at the office? What antics does the family get up to on holidays? How's his driving? What does other kids at school say when he comes to pick up his two lil' darlings?

Octodad is more than that. There's a story behind it, and a pretty nice message too.\n\nI don't normally write reviews, but I felt like I had to for this game because I feel like I could personally relate to it in my own little way. Although this is purely subjective I believe that behind the story is possibly one of the most powerful messages about love and acceptance.\n\nIf you want to hear my conclusion of the message behind the story then read the spoilers below.\n\nThroughout the entire story Octodad is trying to hide his identity as an Octopus in his attempt to fit in with the humans and keep his happy family together. All through the game he messes up, he's a walking disaster, he can't do anything without destroying half of the things in his path, you can hear people talking about his "sliminess" and general negative comments, along with the chef constantly trying to kill him.\n\nI think we've all felt like this at times, and maybe even wondered if we're worthy of love if this is all we do and so many people dislike us.  but his family still love him. They still love this "Slimy" "disgusting" octopus-man even though nobody else, and possibly himself understood why. They saw the good in this kind and caring being that he most likely didn't and loved him despite his octo-flaws. I guess you could say they also gave him a reason to believe in himself, to defy the odds and ultimately reveal his true self to his family, to love himself exactly the way he is and live that happy life we're all searching for. Ultimately I believe that although many negative comments and hurt may be thrown our way by other people, it doesn't make the good we and others see in ourselves any less real.\n\nI dedicate this review to my wonderful girlfriend, who saved me like Octodad's family saved Octodad.\n\n10/10","May 4","true","5.1"," 21 of 22 people (95%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","95","21","22","3","3"

It reminded me of the terrible Surgeon Simulator, which I absolutely hated because of the impossible controls. But after thinking about it, I decided to give it a try anyway. And it's one of the cutest, charming games on the market.\n\nThe story is about an octopus who somehow manages to become a family man. It involves doing chores (missions) for and with your family and while that sounds lame, these missions fit right in because well, it all revolves about having a family. And the playable backstory shows you how you became a husband and father.\n\nIt's short, lasting about 2 hours, but there are ties to collect in all the levels so there's some replay value. But most of you will, like me, probably just ignore it.\n\nThe graphics are colorful and sharp, and the voice acting is great for a game of this caliber. The music is also very well done. There are some visual glitches here and there but they can be ignored because, you know, there are a lot of tentacles to move around. It doesn't detract from the experience if a tentacle doesn't properly connect with an object. Yes, it's noticeable but not weird and you probably won't even notice if after a few times because you're too busy controlling all these tentacles.\n\nAnyway, Octodad Dadliest Catch is awesome !

The cutscenes are cute and make you smile every now and then. Yes, Octodad is a ragdoll physics game, but unlike other ragdoll physics game, this one is story-driven, so you won't get bored within the first 30 minutes of playing it. In each scene, you are recquired to complete a set of tasks. As the game progresses, these tasks get a little harder to complete, but they're never impossible.\n\nI've seen some people complain about the controls. I use a mouse (don't have a controller), and while it was hard to move Octodad around at first, you do get used to it. However, if you want to play the local co-op mode, you'll need a controller.","April 2","true","5.2"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","17","17","5","1"

You control a Dad who is a octopus and your main goal is "looks normal inside your family". Objetives inside game are things like cut grass, make coffee, give milk to kids, go to grocery store and buy stuff, and more. Maybe you think, how difficult can be this game? Well, controlling this dad is very hard. In my honest opinion, if you don't have a controller, you will have a bad time. Even with controller you must do carefully movements. Any non-normal movement while people is near you will lead to a "suspicious" over you. If bar fills up, you are caught. Movements like rolling over a banana shell and falling is a suspicious movement. Also, while moving around, destroying everything near you will your arms or legs. Can't say more due to not finishing game yet.\n\nAbout graphics, being a indie game, is very well developed. It has that "animated look" everywhere, and is pleasant to my eyes. Sounds are very good, especially when Dad must talk. What I totally hate is camera. You can't move camera around, and that makes some situations a lot difficult. Also, camera changes while you are moving. That means, if you have sticks in controllers towards "up" position, and camera change, you could do something bad in game and get caught if you don't change instantly stick directions. But if you like challeges, this won't be a problem. Besides that, difficulty in game is translated in how fast is filled suspicious bar and how much precise should be your movements.\n\nIn general, this game is very good. If you want to play something funny, pick it up for sure.","February 9, 2014","true","1.5"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

It even has its own workshop! The workshop list is currently fairly short, but at the end of the day, game was released only few days ago.\n\nI absolutely loved the level of interaction you have with the surrounding environment. Missions are exciting and while being linearly story-driven, every major level has a certain sandbox zone where you can enjoyably mess around with everything you see.\n\nWhen I was playing the ‘fix-the-aquarium’ mission, one story from my past came to mind. I have a friend with whom we attended the same boarding school. One day we decided to play Titan Quest (2007), which was just released. So here we are, approaching the final boss, but as we will find out later, our game was somehow corrupted, which made that NPC immortal. After failing our tenth desperate attempt to slay that mob, my friend shuts his laptop and punches it with fist as hard as he can, which also “coincidently” results in brutal death of his laptop.\n\nWhat I am trying to say here is that people, who also get easily frustrated, may find this game difficult to enjoy due to complex controls and barriers towards getting hold of the hidden ties (collectibles). For the rest, if you do not mind closing a blind eye on a few bugs, you will find these 3-4 hours of gameplay absolutely pleasurable.","February 3, 2014","true","10.6"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

It's hard to move Octodad, which of course as we all know it's designed to be this way.  Doing mundane tasks such as mowing the lawn or making coffee is now apparently "hilarious" because we can't control our character.  Don't get me wrong, I like this idea too and it's fun seeing Octodad flail all over the place but it gets stale fast.  So, sure, Octodad is "fresh", but that freshness lasts about as long as leaving a slice of bread on the counter (i.e not long).\n\nThere's really not a lot to talk about when it comes to Octodad.  Heck, there's not even much of it to play.  If you've kept up with Octodad only in the media, it's safe to say you've probably seen at least half of the game already, it's that short.  The asking price for this game is $15.00.  $11.00 if you get it while its on sale.  However my advice is to wait until it goes on sale for 5 or lower.\n\nThere's simply not enough content here to merit the 10 or 15 dollar asking price.","February 1, 2014","false","20.0"," 95 of 173 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","95","173","0","6"

If you think you'll be just fine with the mouse and you have difficulties with your hands, be ready to take this game in bite sized sittings or not at all. This "perfectly normal husband and father" really moves just like an octopus and you have to patiently guide him with difficult controls. If you have any nerve pain, you're going to feel it. Get some compression gloves on, gamers.\n\nThis aside, this has been one of the most delightful games I have ever played. It's a very delightful story. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want to order some sushi! You'll want to go protest at your local aquarium for the liberation of all fishes! It's really an enjoyable game that anyone can play (with patience and practice).\n\nThe story is sweet. It's a little on the cutesy side, but very comical in only a way a suit-wearing octopus can. The graphics are bright and cheerful. Any catch? I think I've run into one glitch, which required me to restart the game and try a mini game again. Total waste of time? About five minutes. Nothing to cry over.\n\nBuy it. Unless you're not into light-hearted things and crazy controls, of course. Of course then I'd have to ask... what kind of man are you? Maybe you're not a man at all!

It manages to be fun, fresh and didn’t stop me laughing from start to finish with the only downside been that I completed it within 2hours, however this doesn’t mean I’m finished with the game I’m still ready to get the achievements and it also supports Workshop that could add hours of fun to the game.\n\nYou take control of an Octopus, if you had not gathered that by now, you walk on landing using the two back buttons (controller) or the mouse buttons, I found the controller and Mouse/Keyboard to work just as well as the other and you are tasked with numerous goals per level such as making coffee, stealing cereal, playing mini games and sneaking around stereotypical groups of people.\n\nThe graphics in the game are well presented, nothing to over the top and I doubt it would win any awards however it fits in well with the game and the game ran at a perfect 120fps even with 16xAA showing that the game is fairly well optimized to run on PC’s.\n\nThe gameplay is mostly physics based, controlling the character though levels, cant really say much more than that, most of the charm is the game is from this and the characters themselves, dim-witted adults and keen children with a mature sense of humour helps you chuckle though the entire game on top of laughing at Octodads poop sense of footing.\n\nI completed the game in 2 hours however I feel for the entertainment value and the price I paid I feel like I already have my money’s worth but still expect me to be jumping back into the game to get the achievements and ties.\n\nI’d happily give OctoDad a 8/10, a very solid Indie game, id love to see a full featured sequel that maybe has more complex puzzles, longer story and more levels, besides that this is one of those games that takes you by surprise at how enjoyable it is.\n\n- Dean\n","February 3, 2014","true","3.0"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

The humour is great, the gameplay is fun and the storyline has its cliches but is clever as is. It's like portal, it's short but it's amazing. If you're not a completionist then this game will take you about 1 hour 40 minutes - 2 hours using a mouse. I've heard a controller is much easier. Although if you're a completionist there's 3 ties in every level and you can try and beat the dev's times (have fun with that)... If you can't get enough even after all that there's some amazing stuff on the workshop to spice it up a bit.

I feel like this game would have had more of an impact if the whole Surgeon Simulator thing hadn't happened by the time it was finally released.)\n\nIn short: it's a game about an octopus who knocks lots of things over while trying to do mundane things like a normal human would. And somehow it manages to be touching.\n\nThe base game is only about 3 hours long, but there's so much polish and passion and humor packed into this game that I just can't help but say I enjoyed my time. There are several dozen clever references to other indie games and geek culture, and if that's not your kind of humor, there is also a constant stream of genuinely witty dialogue from the characters.\n\nThere are some tough parts in later levels, but there is always a way to cheese past them easily if you're observant. And there are lots of extras to find that will easily boost the playtime to 10 hours and beyond.\n\nIn all, an excellent entry into the "Slapstick Physics" genre, and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't given this genre a try yet. Though I probably wouldn't pay more than $10 for it, personally.","February 12, 2014","true","4.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

Of course short would depend on your ability to figure out how to move Octodad effectively.  It's not terribly difficult but there's a learning curve.  Think of this game like a sitcom wherein you're an octopus pretending to be human and hijinks ensue.  That would be my best description of the game.  If you can pick it up for under $5 ($15 seems too high for me) I'd say you'll definitely get your money's worth.  Replay value to be had trying to collect all the ties and picking up achievements.  You can also try to get a decent time by doing the free play mode after the story ends but that would be for your own personal satisfaction.  Also a coop mode which I haven't tried but seems like some laughs could be had trying to work together.\n\nTo sum up: It's a cool game, pick it up on the cheap and you won't be disappointed.","June 20, 2015","true","8.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Of course short would depend on your ability to figure out how to move Octodad effectively.  It's not terribly difficult but there's a learning curve.  Think of this game like a sitcom wherein you're an octopus pretending to be human and hijinks ensue.  That would be my best description of the game.  If you can pick it up for under $5 ($15 seems too high for me) I'd say you'll definitely get your money's worth.  Replay value to be had trying to collect all the ties and picking up achievements.  You can also try to get a decent time by doing the free play mode after the story ends but that would be for your own personal satisfaction.  Also a coop mode which I haven't tried but seems like some laughs could be had trying to work together.\n\nTo sum up: It's a cool game, pick it up on the cheap and you won't be disappointed.","June 20, 2015","true","8.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I feel like this game would have had more of an impact if the whole Surgeon Simulator thing hadn't happened by the time it was finally released.)\n\nIn short: it's a game about an octopus who knocks lots of things over while trying to do mundane things like a normal human would. And somehow it manages to be touching.\n\nThe base game is only about 3 hours long, but there's so much polish and passion and humor packed into this game that I just can't help but say I enjoyed my time. There are several dozen clever references to other indie games and geek culture, and if that's not your kind of humor, there is also a constant stream of genuinely witty dialogue from the characters.\n\nThere are some tough parts in later levels, but there is always a way to cheese past them easily if you're observant. And there are lots of extras to find that will easily boost the playtime to 10 hours and beyond.\n\nIn all, an excellent entry into the "Slapstick Physics" genre, and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't given this genre a try yet. Though I probably wouldn't pay more than $10 for it, personally.","February 12, 2014","true","4.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

And the fun with this game is that you must do these things but being a octopus and having eight leg's, you will become very wobbly and difficult to control, but at the same time making it fun and have yourself laughing while playing.\n\nWorkshop\nAfter/Before you complete the game you could always go to the steam workshop area to download some very funny mods/tweaks to the gameplay. There is not as much when it come's to the amount of mods like Skyrim or Garry's mod but atleast it give's you something else to the game.\n\nOverall The game is worth the price and could not recommend enough.","September 20, 2015","true","7.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's a short game (longer than DLC Quest but shorter than Portal) and for $15 you might argue you're not getting a lot. This game is fueled by quirkiness, relies on it, really, and its replay value depends on how efficiently you can convert its brand of humor into your personal brand of fun.\n\nI got a few laughs out of it, but also a few frustrations. For the buildup to the final boss you're tossed into an irresponsibly designed level of precision platforming, bad camera, and a floor that falls under your feet with very little conveyance. This is a massive contrast to the rest of the game with its open environments and reliance of a more-or-less static world. I got stuck in the world geometry more than I'd care to admit there, but think of it less as a nitpick and more as indicative of the overall game - I feel the developers got a fun toy (constraint physics), decided to wrap a one-off around it, and ran out of ideas. I really do think this game was intended to be $15 worth of game-hours but they had to piece together what they had and sell it.\n\nLike I said, I'm hard pressed to find $15 of value here. I didn't try co-op nor go for some of "advanced" achievements but I don't think it would have rocketed this game to a glowing recommendation.","June 27, 2014","false","3.2"," 23 of 43 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","23","43","0","0"

You must perform mundane tasks to take care of your family, while escaping from a sushi chef who can hold quite the grudge.\n\nThe control scheme in Octodad is where the real meat of this game is. You can control one arm and both legs by utilizing all sticks and triggers on a gamepad. I'm not sure if mouse and keyboard is supported, but I think using that would take away from some of the fun. You will really have to utilize all your concentration and hand-eye coordination to move with Octodad. Even in the endgame I was still getting frustrated at times just trying to move around, but that's pretty much the whole point of the game. There's plenty of leeway for when you need to manipulate objects, thankfully. Each level has a checkpoint system, so if you fail, which will probably happen a few times, you go right back to the beginning of the latest objective and don't lose too much progress.\n\nOctodad: Dadliest Catch is pretty short, and can be beaten in maybe 90 minutes. Most of the levels are entertaining enough that you will want to try them again, either to beat your previous best time or to find collectables and unlock achievements. A lot of fun can be had by seeing how much of a jerk you can be with the physics in all the levels. This game has workshop support, which will add some replayability to the game as well. The graphics are very cartoonish, and work well with the story and whole idea of the game.\n\nOctodad: Dadliest Catch was very enjoyable for the time that it lasted on my runthrough. I wish it was a little longer, but Workshop support is there if I feel the need to play more levels. Still, the devs could have added a little more to make this a longer experience. I will definitely go back to it from time to time and see how I could have completed the levels differently. I would recommend this game, but keep in mind that it will take more than one playthrough to get your money's worth.\n\nGrade: B","July 22, 2014","true","3.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The main lure of this game is its controls, which are both frustrating and hilarious. Many times I would find myself at a difficult point of the game, but still be laughing my ♥♥♥ off and cracking jokes as I flailed about helplessly. What surprised me was the quality of the story and writing the game presented, creating a funny yet heartwarming story of a man who loves his family...who just so happens to be an octopus. I espically love when the game gets descriptive of Octodad's 'blurbs' or the often odd banter of background characters. While the game's story is 'short' by how much content it has, the game's difficulty, its replayability with speed runs and collectables, the Co-Op gameplay, and its custom levels with the Steam Workshop make sure that this game can entertain for a long time.\n\nOverall, this game is absolutely amazing for a simple indie title. The controls are as fun as they are frustrating, the story is impressive, creating well-written characters and a world that is both mundane and yet slightly off at the same time, and there are a lot of oppertunities for replayability. My only issue is with ONE section of the game which, while it progresses for the story's sake, is a change in the gameplay I wasn't too found of. But it's a minor thing at best and doesn't take anything away from this beautiful expierence in the life of a true family man (and not an octopus).

A game where the controls are "bad" for a reason. For the matter I'd suggest using a controller for this game. WARNING: I have not given the options menu a thought. Please read other reviews for details in that regard. This review also regards multiplayers with two or more people in the room. Please keep that in mind.\n\nPlot: It's entertaining. It puts you through different scenarios which causes some funny momments. I don't want to spoil even if there isn't much to spoil. You play as an octopus that pretends to not be an octopus, while you try to be a good father even though there are some issues regarding your marraige.\n\nController: They are weak, but fitting at the same time. Just as they are supposed to be. I'm not trying to say they're bad, because in this game the controlls work exactly like they should! Luckily they explain how to use the controlls early. so you know what to do  for the rest of the game in a sensitive way.\n\nGraphics: Not impressive at all. However, they are easy on the eyes. As a person that has issues regarding certain graphics, I have found no issues here. The physics are impressive. However it feels like the game relies a bit too heavily on it (physics that is).\n\nMultiplayer: Defiently the way to play this game. Even while only controlling one arm this was a hillarious game to play. I'd highly suggest to play this in a room with your friends as it includes controller support. Which means, you can play on the     mouse while they play on the controllers.\n\nMusic/sound: It gets quite repetetive early on. Please note that I played multiplayer and put little attention to the different tracks due to this.\n\nGameplay: I'd suggest playing with friends as it allows you to make some incredibly silly moves that is guaranted to make us with a "bad" sense of humour laugh for hours. It is a short game and that is dissapointing in many ways. The game developers could had done plenty of things to extend the gameplay. I do have to applaud them for their creative and mildly said unusuall gameplay though (this is not a bad thing!).\n\nOverall, I'd defiently recommend this game to be played with friends (need a controller for this. even offline). It is funny, filled with refferences to games, shows etc. A good way to figure out wether you want to play the game or not would be watching some videos regarding the game. I'd recommend the Total biscuit one personally. But do keep in mind that this is an incredibly short game that can be completed in aproximatly two and a half hours if done correctly.\n\nIf you have any "issues" regarding this "review" please tell why. Or not. I'm not your boss. But it would help me understand.","February 7, 2014","true","9.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The main lure of this game is its controls, which are both frustrating and hilarious. Many times I would find myself at a difficult point of the game, but still be laughing my ♥♥♥ off and cracking jokes as I flailed about helplessly. What surprised me was the quality of the story and writing the game presented, creating a funny yet heartwarming story of a man who loves his family...who just so happens to be an octopus. I espically love when the game gets descriptive of Octodad's 'blurbs' or the often odd banter of background characters. While the game's story is 'short' by how much content it has, the game's difficulty, its replayability with speed runs and collectables, the Co-Op gameplay, and its custom levels with the Steam Workshop make sure that this game can entertain for a long time.\n\nOverall, this game is absolutely amazing for a simple indie title. The controls are as fun as they are frustrating, the story is impressive, creating well-written characters and a world that is both mundane and yet slightly off at the same time, and there are a lot of oppertunities for replayability. My only issue is with ONE section of the game which, while it progresses for the story's sake, is a change in the gameplay I wasn't too found of. But it's a minor thing at best and doesn't take anything away from this beautiful expierence in the life of a true family man (and not an octopus).

Like, actually well written comedy.\nD: Octopus.\nE: The uh ... "mechanics" of the game, although awkward, are so incredibly well done, it's impressive.\nF: It has a theme song. (I'm not kidding. It's like the first thing you hear after the first 'level' of the game.)\nG: You really can't say no to a game like this when it also has co-op, which makes it even more hilarious.\nH: I don't think I mentioned the part where you are an OCTOPUS.\nI: This is everything marriage is about.\n\nBut in all seriousness, (and hilarity), for what this game is, it's completely worth every single penny you throw at it and more. Each of the levels are so cleverly and wonderfully designed to work with the mechanics of the octopus dad, it's amazing. The writing is comedic and rather witty, definitely had me chuckling a few times and laughing out loud during others! I can easily say I have not enjoyed a game so much as this one in a long time, and that's really saying something for me. My only complaint is that the game is short. (Provided you are skillful enough with the controls, hehe.) But hey, I'm more than willing to reccomend it, because I would -LOVE- a sequel.\n\n10/10, would play again.

The game comes from a collage game called Octodad (Duh). The game is really creative as how an octopus is trying to blend in and do basic tasks a human would do...But after the 3rd level of the game Octodad: Dadliest Catch starts demanding you to be stealthy and avoid this and that. Then the game loses itself under generic, bland, and unoriginal stealth missions. Yet is the game still good. Well lets find out\n\nThe story (Warning Spoilers)\nThe story of Octodad is kept simple for the most part. You are an octopus that raises a family and tries to blend in to human tasks. Yet after going shopping Scarlet (his wife) takes him and the kids (Tommy and stacy) to the aquarium. Of course this is when the game loses its charm. Of course since he's an octopus he has a fear of the aquarium. Then after being tricked by the chef in the first game by making a mannequin of Scarlet he is thrown into the aquarium where Octodad thinks about how he met Scarlet (For unknown reasons) The chef finds where his family is and begins to tell them his secret. Octodad comes to the cafeteria where they really know how Octodad really was an octopus. The Chef tries to kill the octopus yet fails in an attempt. Octodad forgives the chef for his wrong doing. Tommy and stacy then ask where they came from and it ends with them having a laugh. So do you notice my problem with this game yet? No? Well lets get to the gameplay.\n\nThe Gameplay\nThe gameplay is completely mouse based. The controls are simple use mouse1 to move your left leg and mouse 2 to use your right leg. The first couple of levels are fine because your an octopus trying to go shopping, making lunch, housecare, and attending your wedding. Yet once we get to the aquarium...the game forgets its purpose. Thats the big stain on this suit. The game becomes a stealth game...a bad stealth game. Levels 4-10 are basically Hide from this and all this complicated garbage that it makes you get sick of it. Also other flaws are how short the game is. I beat the game in a good 2 hours. There isn't even much replayability to this game though. I loved the original. So what happened with the sequel?\n\nThe Verdict\nOctodad: Dadliest Catch is a small yet enjoyable game. But the stealth, the length ruins all of it. The game ends right when it picks up. The game is still fun and you will still enjoy it with fun and rage once your done.\n\n6.5/10\nPassable\n\nPros\n+ITS OCTODAD\n+Creativity\n+Expirementing\n\nCons\n-Length\n-THE DANG STEALTH MISSIONS\n-Controls","November 25, 2014","true","9.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

His old war buddy Jonny soap is like "yo" and shoots the nazis in the face and then boom another shot goes off and hitler is bye bye. The young man comes back home as a grown man. He finds that the world around him is not what it seems, it changed very much very. So. This. Is. His. Story. He then tries to find his friend Soap but ends up only finding his left leg limb infront of hitlers house. So he then devotes his life to killing people with his left limb. later that day he found a bullet in the ground from digging for gold to pay his rent. he takes that bullet to the CIA department of bullet tracing technology and finds taht it was hitlers bullet all along. this means... hitler killed himself. So he finds out johnny is actually allive. this stuns him and makes him go in acoma. he wakes up in a zombie apocolypse alone. he makes his way out of the bloody horrifying hospital to only find that his wife and son went to atlanta to survive. he makes it there after meeting tyrone jamalkins and his son donavinn. he then sees soap.. his old partner in war and soap took his wife, clarise. so he then kills soap on a farm and the zombies like die. he then goes back to his life but doesnt make any more money. so then he sees that his brother-in-law busts meth dealers that make fat stacks of cheese (implying $$$). so then he becomes a meth cook and changes his name to heisenpus. from then he goes on meeting drug lords and like having a really good story and all. from there he then kills like a ton of people with a gun and is sent to the shadow deef. he then is there for 12 years and has to live off of pooping in a bucket and some soup. a priest helps him escape but dies in the process so it kinda sucks. once he makes it out he gets his revenge on everyone who betrays him. He then leads the scottish army against the british to save his humanity but then is almost dead. Now from here he then gets invited to join the 'Thield' and be part of the 'Bavengers'. He then falls down into a nuclear reacted tank of lemonade that turns him into an octopus. This is very tragic in his life. very.very.trangic. from then he becomes an octopus taking on his old name as a meth cook heisenpus. He seeks to remarry his old wife who thinks he is like long gone because he was really cool. this is where it leaves off and know you play an octopus who acts like a human to get his old life back.

It is just more Octodad, but with better levels and is pretty much an attempt to fill in the lore of Octodad. So for all of you Octodad slash fanfic writers out there, THIS GAME HAS ALL THE ANSWERS TO YOUR QUESTIONS.\n\nI can't talk further about how I feel about this game without spoilers, so here goes:\n\nAt the end, Octodad is finally forced to reveal that he is an octopus to his family. The game ends with Octodad and the Chef making nice-nice and agreeing to leave each other alone. And the game ends with the full knowledge of the family knowing Octodad is an octopus. This is the approximate point where I was frustrated and tired of ♥♥♥♥ing Octodad, and I was ready to quit the game and slag it off if there was anything further to play. The gimmick wore off, the novelty is gone, and there was me and the crazy physics octopus trying to navigate a fire filled room and a very deflating final boss battle. The end feels like a finality to Octodad, the official THE END on the whole thing. And I think it's an absolutely perfect time to end the series.\n\nThis is the last Octodad game. Octodad is done. As it is, Octodad is perfect and there is no need to make another Octodad game.\n\nI will take away my positive recommendation if there is another sequel.","November 27, 2014","true","2.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/juan0tron/recommended/224480/","juan0tron","juan0tron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/juan0tron/","363 products in account","Review text copied from my blog, Sprites and Dice[spritesanddice.blogspot.com]. Check it out to see more reviews, editorials, and features!\n\nLife is hard sometimes. Getting up in the morning, commuting to work, paying rent...it can be a hassle. Now, imagine doing all of that while also being an octopus. Makes your day to day problems seem small, doesn't it? This is the essence of Octodad: Dadliest Catch. Hilariously failing at mundane things like opening doors and waiting in line is a joy to watch, especially with a character as goofy and emotive as Octodad.\n\nI'm quite the fan of awkward control schemes. From Katamari Damacy to Surgeon Simulator 2013, I love it when games make me stop and think about how to interact with not only the game, but the controller itself. Much of the humor in Dadliest Catch's gameplay comes from this learning curve. You control each of Octodad's legs and one of his arms individually as the rest of his body ragdolls behind. This makes simple things like traversing across a room difficult, especially when there's plenty of furniture to knock over along the way. There are plenty of input options to choose from, too: a mouse, the Mac's multitouch trackpad, and when the PS4 version launches, even the Playstation Move. Despite the intentional awkwardness of the controls, it's actually rather easy to pick up any of these inputs. I played the majority of the game on my Macbook switching between the mouse and the trackpad, though I was most comfortable using a controller. Regardless of how awkward the controls were, it never felt like I was fighting with them. The way Octodad moves is not as random as it might seem at first, and understanding that is immensely satisfying in its own way.\n\nIt's also just satisfying to watch Octodad move and...be Octodad. His facial expressions change depending on the context - whether he's tired, angry, scared, or just blinking, it's hard not to keep laughing, especially when his goofy face is flopping all over the place. Even more hilarious is the sound design - the squishes, pops, bloops, and blubs all have their own humorous charm. Even when listening to someone else play this game without looking, you can tell just how much chaos is happening.\n\nIt'd be a shame to bring up the sound design without bringing up the excellent voice acting. Octodad speaks in a series of blubs, and while they sound hilarious on their own, the subtitles make them even better. Octodad's wife and kids are also well-acted, and his kids have some of the funniest dialogue that actually sounds like it would come out of a pair of children.\n\nThe game is a little short - it only took me a little over three hours - but is addictively replayable. I almost played the entire game twice in one day because it was just fun to show the game to different people. Levels are densely packed with humorous references to other games, and each has three ties cleverly hidden for the player to find and wear.  Each level also has a developer time to beat, and just the thought of watching speedruns and all the things possible within the physics engine gets me excited. There's also a local co-op mode for two to four players, where each player is responsible for specific limbs on Octodad's body. Even when the base game runs dry, there are still tons of levels to download on the Steam workshop, as well as a level editor. I have a feeling that once players get really comfortable with Octodad's controls, we'll start seeing some crazy challenge levels that will require precise understanding of the game's physics engine.\n\nOverall, Octodad: Dadliest Catch is one of the most charming, funny games I've ever played. It's hard not to love Octodad. We all have secrets, and while I've never personally been an octopus, I can understand the fear Octodad has of being found out. He just wants to be loved, and I'm sure everyone who plays this game will.","February 1, 2014","true","26.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pablomakaveli/recommended/224480/","pablomakaveli","pablomakaveli","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pablomakaveli/","813 products in account","I was expecting a Goat Simulator clone with this game but was pleasantly surprised that this ended up being a fun game. You play an octupus who is pretending to be human,who also has a family somehow. The levels in the game sees you trying to do simple everyday tasks while trying to avoid drawing to much attention so you aren't outed as being an octupus. This sounds easy enough but the catch is that each of Octodads limbs is controlled seperately and you have to co-ordinate each limb to complete your tasks.\n\nThis is actually quite fun and trying to do things like mow the lawn while your falling about swinging a lawnmower as you go is a memorable experience. This game is surprisingly structured with a story and levels with various goals which is something i hadn't expected,as i had anticipated a sandbox type game similar to Goat Simulator. What really lets the game down is how short it is. You could easily finish this in a couple of hours which is a shame as it feels like they could have maybe packed in a few more levels. There is a range of mods that give limited replay value but the ones i did try i didn't play for very long.\n\nThe Good:\n- fun light hearted casual game\n- levels are enjoyable and so is trying co-ordinate Octodad through seemingly simple tasks\n\nThe Bad:\n- very short\n\nOverall this is a decent game and though it seems a silly premise i enjoyed it more than i thought. It's let down by how short it is and i really can't recommend buying this game at full price for that reason. If you like casual silly games then pick this up when it's on sales. If you hated games like Goat Simulator or Surgeon Simulator give this a miss. 6.5/10","July 8, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Years later after its kickstarter, we now have Octodad: Dadliest Catch. But what is Dadliest Catch? Is a sequel to the previous game? Is it a brand-new game? Or just a remake of the original? Well, it's kind of a remake to the original game, but adds more story to Octodad, and brings new challenges and obstacles to our beloved father in disquise.\n\n(*** This Part Of The Review WILL Contain Spoilers - Skip Past This If You Plan On Purchasing This Game***)\n\nLet's start with the story: After your wedding, you begin your day like any other, doing chores around the house when you'll be brought to a surprise visit to the Aquirium, where you'll learn about the past life and constant procautions Octodad must overcome while being out in Public. Overall, the story and overall humor is very corny and cheesy, but is still cheary and will bring a smile to nearly anyone's face. It has its charm to it. The voice acting in this game is pretty good - all the characters fit for what their parts are, and it adds life to the game when you hear your family talking about practically anything while you're tossing your Lawn Mower around like a maniac, mowing smile patches of grass at a time.\n\n(***End of Spoilers***)\n\nNow for the gameplay: The gameplay, well, how can I put it? There is no real "Genre" for this title, so I'll put it like this: It's definitly a physics-based game that uses awkward, yet sometimes hilarious movement and action to achieve any objective. It's an adventure-puzzle-solving game with physics being the main gimmick of the game. After the first level, you'll have to perform different tasks to achieve your goals, using physics and Octodad's traditional "walking" to get from place to place. Overall, the game is fun to play. As for the puzzles, I will say this right now: The Game isn't TOO Hard, yet after the first and second levels, the game's difficulty definitly rises up. So for those questioning whether or not it's a kids game or not...I'm going to say it's safe to say that this game can be challenging for practically anyone who plays it, but at the same, it's not so easy that it holds your hand all the way through, but not so hard that you won't be yanking your hair out if you fall or misplace an action or two. As for the puzzles themselves, they're all different and original - there wasn't a time where I saw the same or similar puzzle being done more than once the entire game, so every puzzle is different and most of them require different ways to complete them.\n\nOkay, now I'm going to say this right now - while the overall game wasn't too hard, I think it's safe to say that the LAST LEVEL IS INSANLY HARD FOR NO GOOD REASON. I only have two major complaints with this game, and one of them being is the last level. For whatever reason, there is a section in the last level where you HAVE to be percise with your steps, otherwise you'll fall off, and will have to watch the same animation of Octodad climbing back up. Over. And Over. And Over. And Over Again. It's annoying as can be. Honestly, I can classify the game's difficulty as "Challenging", but I think the developers were just lazy with the last level and wanted to stretch out the game's length. It's needlessly hard, not clever, and was the only time throughout the whole game I started to get aggrivated. Eventually, though, I finished the challenge. And, honestly, I liked the Ending of the game. Funny and Adorable at the same time.\n\nThen, we get to my second major complaint with this game, and this is probably the biggest one:\n***THE GAME IS TOO SHORT!!!***\n\nI completed Octodad: Dadliest Catch within TWO HOURS. Two, count'em, TWO hours. For a 15 dollar game? Are you nuts? Only TWO hours. Granted, I bought this game on the First-Day release sale for 20% off, but still. 10-12 dollars for a two hour game? That's ridiculous. Well, the General Game is two hours along. Is there anything you can do to increase the replay-value of this game? Nope. All you can do to increase the replay-value is to either:\nA) Play the game again\nB) Play the game again, cooperativly or in singleplayer.\nC) Go Achievement Hunting.\n\nAnd not everyone is going to be attracted to go out and achieve, well, achievements! Now, me, personally, I love going after Achievements that doesn't damage your mental state, but again, not everyone will want to go after them, making this game have little to NO replay value! It saddens me that this is my ONLY True Gripe with the game. I had so much fun playing this gem, and I still think back to it and think it was definitly worth the time spent on it...but it's such a shame that the time that was spent on it, was TWO HOURS!!!\n\nI'll be quick with the graphics - the graphics are nice. I do have a couple graphic-design issues with the game, personally, such as The Mother's awkward model, but the overall graphics are nice, cartoony, and filled with color. My only true problem with the graphics is that there is practically three different models for the pedestrians. Everyone outside of Octodad's family looks THE SAME. Other than that, I have no major problems with the graphics and design choises with this game.\n\n\nSo, we're down the final thoughts of the game. Is the game worth it's price? No, but hear my out on this one: The game is FUN, FUN, and more FUN. I had a smile on my face playing this game; solving puzzles in unique ways, walking like a maniac with Octodad, and smiling and laughing at the game's Family-Friendly sense of humor. But when it comes down to it, the game is great and all, but its length is its greatest downfall. Maybe if this game was 10 dollars *At the Most!* by retail, I wouldn't have much of a problem with it, but, honestly, I think it's only worth playing at a friend's house, or buying it when it's on sale. If this game would possibly one day include an expansion pack or SOMETHING to genuinely increase the Overall Gameplay, than this game would've been worth every penny. But where it stands, it's just not worth the 15 bucks.\n\nThough, don't get me wrong. The Folks who've made this game put a lot of time and effort into it, and I do hope more is made and brought to us. Until then, I'll be recommending this game to you all, just so long as you get it on sale, and appreciate all the game does have and bring to us.","July 12, 2014","true","22.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jru247/recommended/224480/","Jru247","Jru247","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jru247/","276 products in account","Octodad is a wonderful premise; an octopus disguised as a human trying to live a normal life, yet failing to do the most basic of things due to the fact that, well, he's an octopus. It sounds like the premise of a great Saturday Morning Cartoon. The result the game delivers however feels a bit more like the 2-hour series finale to an Octodad cartoon, rather than a pilot to kickstart a great new IP.\n\nThe mechanic of flailing around, switching between controlling Octodad's arm and his legs works well enough, making the puzzles difficult but not impossible (although some of the arcade games are a real pain to finish). Some of the puzzles toward the end can feel really, for lack of a better word, gamey. Climbing difficult platforms and even a boss fight. The big selling point for the gameplay was that the difficulty came from doing things normal people can suceed without a lot of difficulty but are substantially harder without proper control of your body. This game is like Surgeon Simulator 2013 in the sense that the main mechanic is frustration and like said game it works to the game's benefit.\n\nThe added co-op feature also adds a bit to the replayability, having one player with the keyboard and mouse control one part of octodad while another player with a controller controls another part. The included "roulette mode" randomly switches which parts are controlled by which player after completing every objective. Both result in a frustratingly fun experience for two players.\n\nThe game's main suffering point is its length; a non-completionist playthrough averaging in around 2 hours. Which is a shame, because the plot is interesting enough to carry you through it and the characters (particularly the titular dad himself) are all very endearing and well written (this is some of the most realistic child dialogue I can think of in a game). The game's humor, besides from the main mechanic, works well throughout the game from start to finish. From various references to generally funny dialogue between characters. It is also nice to see a family friendly game around. I can easily see a child laughing at Octodad's goofy antics and blubbing, or perhaps playing co-op with a sibling or parent.\n\nOctodad could have easily been done in an episodic format; a new episode, some new mundane situation made more challenging by being an octopus (jury duty, career day at school, chaperoning a field trip, etc.). The announcement of free levels being added later this summer does give me hope for Octodad. I could easilly see myself paying money for a big pack of levels in this style.\n\nIn the end, Octodad is a short but sweet title. Enjoyable for children and adults, a good sense of humor, memorable characters, and gameplay unlike any other. Hopefully upcoming updates from Young Horses and content from the Steam Workshop will help make Octodad: Dadliest Catch a classic.","June 29, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You play an octupus who is pretending to be human,who also has a family somehow. The levels in the game sees you trying to do simple everyday tasks while trying to avoid drawing to much attention so you aren't outed as being an octupus. This sounds easy enough but the catch is that each of Octodads limbs is controlled seperately and you have to co-ordinate each limb to complete your tasks.\n\nThis is actually quite fun and trying to do things like mow the lawn while your falling about swinging a lawnmower as you go is a memorable experience. This game is surprisingly structured with a story and levels with various goals which is something i hadn't expected,as i had anticipated a sandbox type game similar to Goat Simulator. What really lets the game down is how short it is. You could easily finish this in a couple of hours which is a shame as it feels like they could have maybe packed in a few more levels. There is a range of mods that give limited replay value but the ones i did try i didn't play for very long.\n\nThe Good:\n- fun light hearted casual game\n- levels are enjoyable and so is trying co-ordinate Octodad through seemingly simple tasks\n\nThe Bad:\n- very short\n\nOverall this is a decent game and though it seems a silly premise i enjoyed it more than i thought. It's let down by how short it is and i really can't recommend buying this game at full price for that reason. If you like casual silly games then pick this up when it's on sales. If you hated games like Goat Simulator or Surgeon Simulator give this a miss. 6.5/10","July 8, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

They're weird, and they're awesome. At first, the controls are cumbersome and incredibly difficult to use, but after 10 or 20 minutes, after you get to grips with it, it's almost like being in control of a flight simulator. You "get it", and using and perfecting the movement is very satisfying.\n\nThe game itself is funny and original, and the perfect length for what it's trying to do, not too short, but not too long. The achievements are cool and add some extra replayability, with an option to time your run for speedrunners (one of the few games I've seen to ever do this!)\n\nSo yeah, I thoroughly recommend this game, I am a very happy backer of this project.\n\nNilesy","July 18, 2014","true","6.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Instead, the game remains marshmallowy and jubilant with antics such as preparing your own coffee and going grocery shopping... with spaghetti as limbs. The gameplay itself is very entertaining, and believe it or not, the controls (for which I recommend the XBOX 360 controller) contribute a lot to the replayability of this game, even if you can't seem to get used to them.\n\nThere's no way NOT to get into a giggle fit when you're slithering through the freezers of the frozen food section to get to the last frozen pizza in the supermarket. Few things are funnier than trying to climb UP a DOWN escalator when--let's face it-- you don't even have the ability to walk, nay, *stand* anywhere without falling.

This part did get pretty frustrating and I only got through it by winging it by throwing his legs everywhere till I could reach the next checkpoint. Bar this, the game was just about flawless.\n\nEach level provides plenty silliness having you performing quite simple everday tasks.  There's usually no punishment for failing these tasks allowing you to laugh at ♥♥♥♥ ups. There are areas where you may be watched where making mistakes can add up to retrying. However, there's a freeplay mode to allow you to go back to levels and be as ridiculous as you can be.\n\nI was not disappointed with Octodad. I was even surprised by how much fun I've had with it. The end does do something that will probably surprise you all. It is a short game but its length fits it. With Steam workshop there's certainly much more nonsense to come.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sludgegaze/recommended/224480/","sludgegaze","✞ p u k e ✞","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sludgegaze/","16 products in account","Comedy is a rare thing in games. Some developers manage it with a witty script, others with outrageous characters that help lighten the mood, but few hit that holy grail of slapstick laugh out loud guffawing like Young Horses do in Octodad: Dadliest Catch.\n\nOctodad is just a typical guy, trying to make his way through life with his wife and two children, except that he is an octopus and he has the additional burden of keeping that a secret. Dressed in his snazzy suit, most people are none the wiser about his true identity, but suspicions rise when he is spotted acting strange.\n\nIn addition to mouse and keyboard control, full game pad support is in place. I ended up preferring playing with a controller, but both work on the same principles. By default, players control three of Octodad's limbs: two legs and one arm. By manipulating their positions in space, Octodad can walk, run, climb, grab objects, and do all of the things a normal human being does. The kicker is that each limb is generally controlled one at a time, and they are all held together with an elasticity that often sends them off in unintended directions.\n\nThe result is almost like handing a non-gamer a controller and putting him in the thick of a first-person shooter; there is a lot of flailing around and looking at the ground. It takes a certain amount of brain rewiring to be able to make Octodad move as intended, even when the necessary sequence of actions is cognitively clear.\n\nIn any other game, these would be complaints, but Octodad is specifically about being uncomfortable and learning how to function in a body that is almost alien. For some, it may be frustrating, but for those willing to put in the effort, it is ultimately rewarding to learn how to function as an octopus in society. By the end, players should be able to walk competently without knocking things over or punching kids in the face too often.\n\nBeing an octopus also affords Octodad some benefits that humans cannot reap, like the ability to squeeze into tight spots or to stretch out over large gaps. Young Horses built this awkward, difficult control scheme, and then crafted environments that take full advantage of its physics.\n\nWhere the previous title was more of a proof of concept on the control scheme, Dadliest Catch delves a bit more deeply into Octodad lore. Revealed over the course of the campaign are how Octodad and his wife Scarlett met, when he decided to start masquerading as a human, and why the neighbourhood sushi chef wants to kill him so badly. Of course, how he and Scarlett managed to have two human children is jokingly brought up but never seriously addressed.\n\nYou can't fault its originality, though. It's a game bursting with colour and personality, although the chirpy music does begin to grate after a while. It's hard not to love Octodad as he stumbles through life, and the levels are filled with cute references to indie games and developers, YouTubers such as SeaNanners and PewDiePie, and many more.\n\nTruly, Dadliest Catch realises how silly its concept is, and never takes itself too seriously. The writing fits the mood perfectly. Some of the off-hand remarks and terrible marine biology puns are worthy of a few laughs, but the general absurdity of the situation in its entirety is the biggest source of humor throughout the game.\n\nThe silliness is conveyed well through the graphics and sound as well. Octodad lives in a colorful cartoon world that serves as a welcome contrast to the muted palettes of more realistic games. The soundtrack is similarly upbeat and peppy, and it features a main theme that will be stuck in my head for years.\n\nAnother potential sticking point for some might be the relatively short length of the story. Clocking in at about three hours, it ends before the central conceit starts to wear thin. Dadliest Catch does about as much as it can with its octopus limb control scheme, but it (ironically) would not have the legs to last much longer. I personally had no issue with the length, but those who like to calculate hours of entertainment per dollar may take exception that the main story finishes not very long after it begins.\n\nAlleviating that a bit are some optional objectives for those who want to keep playing. Each level hides three custom neckties for Octodad to wear, each requiring thorough exploration, tricky climbing, or some interaction with the environment. Additionally, each level has a par time to beat, opening it up for potential speed running.\n\nAlso included is Steam Workshop support, so users can create their own levels, and a hilarious cooperative mode that allows up to four players to control one or more limbs, requiring an unusual form of teamwork and resulting in an even more awkward octopus than usual. Despite the short length of the campaign, there is enough in place for diehard enthusiasts to keep going for as long as they want.\n\nIn the end, I would not be surprised to hear that the Octodad community is thriving years down the road. It exudes a certain weirdness and charm that makes it stand out from a lot of other titles out there, and there are tools in place for it to live on past the point when the credits start to roll. Though it has some issues with frame rate drops and its approach to control is definitely not for everybody, Dadliest Catch kept a smile on my face for most of its duration.\n\nTL;DR: The long-awaited video game adaptation of The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife.","March 16, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's funny, it's great, but if you're not a fan of slapstick humour, you won't find half of the humour in this game funny.\n\nOctodad: Dadliest Catch is an... interesting game just to say the least. You play an octopus disguised as a human with a family. It's like, what? But, miraculously, it still makes a great game. The co-op feature in this game is absolutely hilarious. That's where most of my 4 hours of this game have went so far with friends. Characters are great, level design is great, and it's quite hard to hate. There are quite a few glitches too, but nothing that breaks the game.\n\nI finished the story with a very satisfied feeling, apart from the fact they don't explain at all where Tommy and Stacy come from...\n\nThe only thing about this game is that it's very, very short. Unlike a huge title game, the campaign is very short. You can finish it in about an hour and a half, and, if you know what you're doing, probably under an hour.  Imagine all the other situations Octodad could get into! Imagine if he had to drive his kids to school? Imagine if he needed to go to a meeting? There are so many things that could have happened, but didn't.\n\nReally, my opinion is, if you're willing to pay $15 for a game that will provide with some humour, tortorus co-op and some Community Workshop items, buy this game. You won't regret, and there'll be at least one reference you didn't see in the first time playing. (e.g. In the shopping level, there's a type of pie that's called "Pewdie Pie." Genius.) But, if you're buying to get hours and hours out of the campaign, online multiplayer and other things from a big budget game, don't buy this game, because you'll be disappointed. I'm just a sort of person that likes creative games, and this is pretty creative, considering you have to do daily dad stuff as an octopus. Find me another game like that and you'll get $100.\n\nWorkshop levels are also insane fun, like making zero gravity Octodad and 'Wrecking Blub.' Not sure if you wanna know but find out for yourself.\n\nIn short, Octodad: Dadliest Catch is worth the money if it's your sort of game, but if you hate short campaigns and what not, but you still want to get the game, wait for a Steam sales to rob your wallet to buy this game.\n\nI'm going to give this game a 8/10","March 15, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Laughed all the way through and enjoyed it, albeit it being relatively short ( 2-3 hours ).\n\nSo is it worth your 13.99€?\n\nYeeeess... and no. Technically the game is really simplistic and the core gameplay is limited. You can move your arms, your legs  and you can grab stuff.\nThat doesn't sound like much but Octodad manages to give you very varied objectives based on usually very mundane everyday tasks. From grilling steaks to learning about friggin kelp, everything you do in this game looks hilarious, especially if you have someone playing who is not that versed in videogames.\n\nThe graphics are nothing to write home about but they capture the games mood and tone perfectly.\nMusic and sounds are great, still got the Octodad theme stuck in my head after 2 weeks of finishing it, heck the whole intro sequence is just brilliant.\n\nI LOVE IT! But is it something for you? If you have a weird sense of humour and don't mind the length of the game I'd say  grab a few friends and this game for a really fun evening ( game can also be played cooperatively, we didn't try it though ).\n\n8/10 - Played with wired Xbox 360 controller\n","February 26, 2014","true","9.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Joakleon/recommended/224480/","Joakleon","Joakleon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Joakleon/","96 products in account","Octodad is a very silly slapstick game with a boatload of charm. The main draw of the game is controlling Octodad through various human environments to accomplish certain objectives. The "octocontrols", which are very sensitive and slippery much like an octopus would be, look complicated at first, but are actually a lot of fun to play with and they never feel too cheap, but more like a learning curve that takes a while to adjust to. Octodad thankfully isn't a hard game either, save for a few parts where you need to be rather accurate with your tentacles. The characters range from the main squid himself who's a likable, determined, but nervous ball of ink, to well written family stereotypes, to having a pun-riddled chef as the main bad guy, to the various annoyed or eccentric human npcs that drive the satire home. The satire is part of the reason I consider Octodad's flaw to be it's length. The game has a great sense of humor, and even with all the achievements and the workshop support and the tie collecting it felt like a sample of something that could have been even bigger and funnier. I wanted more, and maybe I expected too much, but that in itself is evidence of how lovable this game can be.\n\nAs a drawn out example, my favorite part of the game is the silly hats and outfits you can wear or put on as disguises, but it was heavily underutilized and not even necessary to progress in the game, besides the ones the game forces you to wear for the plot. You're an octopus pretending to be a human, that's what this game is about, so having an optional hitman-like disguise system would have added a lot of fun. If it ever gets a sequel I hope this is perhaps expanded upon. Despite my moaning about what could have been, I'm still going to recommend Octodad, though, because for what it's worth it's still enjoyable, humerous, slapsticky fun with a great sense of wit and enough extra content for replayability.","February 2, 2014","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In an experience that is pretty much Zoidberg The Kluts the game it was a poor choice for levels to let you fail them in the way they do. It should be about destruction and not skill. The point is that Octodad controlls in a very different way from characters in other games. His steps can be very imprecise, and that goes the same for his arm movements. It probably works better with a controller, but either way the geologists make the game very unpleasent at times. Hiding has an extra layer of difficulty when you seem to bob up and down out of cover. The challenging bits should have been getting the ties and other various collectables, and not just getting through the game. Maybe have some challene levels but the game was sold on hilarious physics and destruction.\n\nThe last level in particular is very annoying as I fly off the on spots you can step on. Have some hard steps, but put amount of time to get through it or something. The last level doesn't seems to keep in mind that the movement of Octodad is the whole point of the game with it's hilarious diologue and other bits as a plus.\n\nThis game is completely worth every penny, and probably more, but there is definitely room for improvement. I'd say that the user levels would save the latter half of the game, but from the ones I tried most are still based on skill of a crazy kluts of a character.\n\nI hope DLC is released for this game. They mentioned things like aliens, stowing away on another ship, the local mayor of the town, all things that could have some hilariously destructable terrain.","February 2, 2014","true","18.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sludgegaze/recommended/224480/","sludgegaze","✞ p u k e ✞","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sludgegaze/","16 products in account","Comedy is a rare thing in games. Some developers manage it with a witty script, others with outrageous characters that help lighten the mood, but few hit that holy grail of slapstick laugh out loud guffawing like Young Horses do in Octodad: Dadliest Catch.\n\nOctodad is just a typical guy, trying to make his way through life with his wife and two children, except that he is an octopus and he has the additional burden of keeping that a secret. Dressed in his snazzy suit, most people are none the wiser about his true identity, but suspicions rise when he is spotted acting strange.\n\nIn addition to mouse and keyboard control, full game pad support is in place. I ended up preferring playing with a controller, but both work on the same principles. By default, players control three of Octodad's limbs: two legs and one arm. By manipulating their positions in space, Octodad can walk, run, climb, grab objects, and do all of the things a normal human being does. The kicker is that each limb is generally controlled one at a time, and they are all held together with an elasticity that often sends them off in unintended directions.\n\nThe result is almost like handing a non-gamer a controller and putting him in the thick of a first-person shooter; there is a lot of flailing around and looking at the ground. It takes a certain amount of brain rewiring to be able to make Octodad move as intended, even when the necessary sequence of actions is cognitively clear.\n\nIn any other game, these would be complaints, but Octodad is specifically about being uncomfortable and learning how to function in a body that is almost alien. For some, it may be frustrating, but for those willing to put in the effort, it is ultimately rewarding to learn how to function as an octopus in society. By the end, players should be able to walk competently without knocking things over or punching kids in the face too often.\n\nBeing an octopus also affords Octodad some benefits that humans cannot reap, like the ability to squeeze into tight spots or to stretch out over large gaps. Young Horses built this awkward, difficult control scheme, and then crafted environments that take full advantage of its physics.\n\nWhere the previous title was more of a proof of concept on the control scheme, Dadliest Catch delves a bit more deeply into Octodad lore. Revealed over the course of the campaign are how Octodad and his wife Scarlett met, when he decided to start masquerading as a human, and why the neighbourhood sushi chef wants to kill him so badly. Of course, how he and Scarlett managed to have two human children is jokingly brought up but never seriously addressed.\n\nYou can't fault its originality, though. It's a game bursting with colour and personality, although the chirpy music does begin to grate after a while. It's hard not to love Octodad as he stumbles through life, and the levels are filled with cute references to indie games and developers, YouTubers such as SeaNanners and PewDiePie, and many more.\n\nTruly, Dadliest Catch realises how silly its concept is, and never takes itself too seriously. The writing fits the mood perfectly. Some of the off-hand remarks and terrible marine biology puns are worthy of a few laughs, but the general absurdity of the situation in its entirety is the biggest source of humor throughout the game.\n\nThe silliness is conveyed well through the graphics and sound as well. Octodad lives in a colorful cartoon world that serves as a welcome contrast to the muted palettes of more realistic games. The soundtrack is similarly upbeat and peppy, and it features a main theme that will be stuck in my head for years.\n\nAnother potential sticking point for some might be the relatively short length of the story. Clocking in at about three hours, it ends before the central conceit starts to wear thin. Dadliest Catch does about as much as it can with its octopus limb control scheme, but it (ironically) would not have the legs to last much longer. I personally had no issue with the length, but those who like to calculate hours of entertainment per dollar may take exception that the main story finishes not very long after it begins.\n\nAlleviating that a bit are some optional objectives for those who want to keep playing. Each level hides three custom neckties for Octodad to wear, each requiring thorough exploration, tricky climbing, or some interaction with the environment. Additionally, each level has a par time to beat, opening it up for potential speed running.\n\nAlso included is Steam Workshop support, so users can create their own levels, and a hilarious cooperative mode that allows up to four players to control one or more limbs, requiring an unusual form of teamwork and resulting in an even more awkward octopus than usual. Despite the short length of the campaign, there is enough in place for diehard enthusiasts to keep going for as long as they want.\n\nIn the end, I would not be surprised to hear that the Octodad community is thriving years down the road. It exudes a certain weirdness and charm that makes it stand out from a lot of other titles out there, and there are tools in place for it to live on past the point when the credits start to roll. Though it has some issues with frame rate drops and its approach to control is definitely not for everybody, Dadliest Catch kept a smile on my face for most of its duration.\n\nTL;DR: The long-awaited video game adaptation of The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife.","March 16, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's funny, it's great, but if you're not a fan of slapstick humour, you won't find half of the humour in this game funny.\n\nOctodad: Dadliest Catch is an... interesting game just to say the least. You play an octopus disguised as a human with a family. It's like, what? But, miraculously, it still makes a great game. The co-op feature in this game is absolutely hilarious. That's where most of my 4 hours of this game have went so far with friends. Characters are great, level design is great, and it's quite hard to hate. There are quite a few glitches too, but nothing that breaks the game.\n\nI finished the story with a very satisfied feeling, apart from the fact they don't explain at all where Tommy and Stacy come from...\n\nThe only thing about this game is that it's very, very short. Unlike a huge title game, the campaign is very short. You can finish it in about an hour and a half, and, if you know what you're doing, probably under an hour.  Imagine all the other situations Octodad could get into! Imagine if he had to drive his kids to school? Imagine if he needed to go to a meeting? There are so many things that could have happened, but didn't.\n\nReally, my opinion is, if you're willing to pay $15 for a game that will provide with some humour, tortorus co-op and some Community Workshop items, buy this game. You won't regret, and there'll be at least one reference you didn't see in the first time playing. (e.g. In the shopping level, there's a type of pie that's called "Pewdie Pie." Genius.) But, if you're buying to get hours and hours out of the campaign, online multiplayer and other things from a big budget game, don't buy this game, because you'll be disappointed. I'm just a sort of person that likes creative games, and this is pretty creative, considering you have to do daily dad stuff as an octopus. Find me another game like that and you'll get $100.\n\nWorkshop levels are also insane fun, like making zero gravity Octodad and 'Wrecking Blub.' Not sure if you wanna know but find out for yourself.\n\nIn short, Octodad: Dadliest Catch is worth the money if it's your sort of game, but if you hate short campaigns and what not, but you still want to get the game, wait for a Steam sales to rob your wallet to buy this game.\n\nI'm going to give this game a 8/10","March 15, 2014","true","11.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I don't remember when was the last time a game has made me laugh and rage so much at the same time. The main mechanic is the frustrating controlls, which makes perfect sense, as you are trying to maneuver a boneless jelly blob around multiple areas full of stuff to break by "accident". The levels never overstay their welcome and there seems to be something new and fun stuff to do all the time.\n\nThe game is a bit on the short side, but that's kind of expected, as there really is just one big mechanic to work with. I blazed through the game in couple of sittings and once you've finished, there's a slowly growing Steam workshop library stuff to mess around with. I may play through it again pretty soon and try to complete every achievement I missed on the first playthrough.

The player controls Octodad, a dapper octopus masquerading as a human, as he goes about his life. Octodad's existence is a constant struggle, as he must master mundane tasks with his unwieldy boneless tentacles while simultaneously keeping his cephalopodan nature a secret from his human family.\n\nOctodad is a great example of a game that conveys a message through gameplay. In conjunction with its story, characters, and setting, the controls offer an empathetic look into the life of an extreme outsider trying to fit in and trying to do right by his family...I love that. Gaming is growing up, and Octodad is some of the best evidence of that.\n\nSmartly built, endlessly entertaining, and unexpectedly heartwarming, Dadliest Catch manages to turn an utterly ridiculous concept into one of the most surprising games in recent memory.\n\nWould recomend!","February 1, 2014","true","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It's very similar to Surgeon Simulator in the sense that it's boasting some wacky controls and a great sense of humour. I also enjoyed the clever references and the surprisingly entertaining storyline. Octodad ticks a lot more boxes than I first expected it to. The game is plagued by a huge problem, however, and it's an issue that I actually have with a lot of indie titles: It's too short. In fact, taking the price tag into account it's criminally short. I finished the whole game in just under 3 hours and I wasn't rushing. However, replay value can balance out a game's price:length ratio and this game is a very fun experience that definitely warrants multiple playthroughs. While I would recommend this game I really want to emphasise that the best move would be to buy it while it's on sale. Awesome game overall, though.

You may have heard complaints that it's too short, but all of those complaints are completely misguided. Yeah, it's short, but it's not too short. In fact, I'd argue that the length is pretty much perfect.\n\nIt's nicely structured too. The first few levels are spent trying to perform ordinary tasks with the clumsy controls, the next few are spent performing a series of challenges to see if you've been paying attention, with the last few focused on wrapping up the story, while also experimenting with the gameplay a little.\n\nAnd to be honest that's all they can do, really. There's nowhere else they could've taken the concept. They could've made a few more levels but I much prefer the huge amount of attention paid to the current levels. It's short yeah, but that's because any unnecessary fluff has been cut off.\n\nI suspect I'll enjoy the game more than most people do, although I'm not sure why. I just find everything about Octodad himself endlessly entertaining. I haven't played any other game where even the act of moving your character is hilarious. I've seen some pretty dark comparisons to the story, relating it to alcoholisms and whatnot, but I think it's actually pretty lovely how he just tries to get on with his life despite being, y'know, an octopus.\n\nOkay I should probably stop rambling now.","February 3, 2014","true","23.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Octodad is about an octopus posing as a human father who has a wife, one son, one daughter. The only person who knows Octodad is an octopus is Chef, (Clever name I know) who spends the game trying to kill you. Octodad: Dadliest Catch looks great, The cartoon artstyle is terrific and looks absoluetly Beutiful. The soundtrack for Octodad: Dadliest Catch is just as good as the artstyle, Beutiful and unique. Unfortunatly, the gameplay in Octodad: Dadliest Catch is where things start going downhill, you have the option of ethier using a Xbox 360 controller or your mouse to play, both are just as fun as they are frustarating. I think the developers of this game made the controls this way on purpose, the controls are clumsy and hard to learn. You have to switch between two gameplay modes, The arms and legs. Constantly switching between these two game modes can be incredibly annoying and frustarating, Because if you are climbing and need to grab on to something, I wish you luck because your not getting it anytime soon im afraid. Now, for all you completionists out there there are collectable ties hidden throughout the game. Each level has three ties on it, Once you collect a tie you are able to were it whenever you want! Also, Octodad: Dadliest Catch has lots of steam workshop levels to offer including zero gravity and being tiny in your living room. Finally, Octodad: Dadliest Catch is fun, amusing, replayable, diffucult, and beutiful. With this said I give Octodad: Dadliest Catch an 8/10.

The dialogue is hilarious, and with a little patience and sheer determination you’re sure to have fun with this game.

It needs to be longer, but it's very polished and there have been no bugs that I have been able to find. I liked the ending. It was, without spoiling it, a traditional boss fight. The boss fight was hard which I, at the time found frustrating, but I am glad it was hard as it would have been an anticlimax otherwise. The implamentation of collectable ties was a good idea. In the future, it would be great to see some implamentation of a multiplayer. That would be quirky and cool though im unsure how it would work. A possibility for custom ties would be a nice addition, possibly adopting the tf2 ideology where you can obtain 'special' ties or hats etc, though I feel that this would only work well with a multiplayer version of the game. I think that the price of £15 may have been slightly too high seeing as the play-time was probably between 4 hours, though I understand that the quality of the game may have dropped if the business's costs were't covered. And besides, if they can produce a game this polished then they probably deserve to earn a good chunk of profit. After getting used to the controls, they were easy to use for what they were - this is obviously a well designed game. I would recomend this game to anyone who's looking for a casual, fun and creative game.

Even with practice it's hard to control Octodad, often ending with very hilarious results (one such moment for me was chucking a lawnmower at my family who was enjoying a delicious dinner of hockey pucks... I mean, burgers.)\n\nThe game isnt overly challenging but there are some moments that make you think but nothing ever made me quit the game in anger. I would definitely give this game 4/5 stars!","February 5, 2014","true","2.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It doesn't have a long storyline to it. But this, however surprisingly, isn't that deterring to the game's quality. Yes, it may be short, but in that short time, they were able to show an emotional story of fatherhood and fear of exposure that will probably get you in your soft spot. The game has so much replay value in it's Free Play mode (Fully unlocked after completing the story), even if it's simply flopping around and being silly. And while the collectables *could* have been expanded, the ties are still a great thing to hunt after.\n\nWhere the game gets it true replay value, howeverm is in the Workshop. Young Horses has graciously given us access to the same level editor they used to make the story levels in Octodad. So now, in the future, you could potentially expect this game to be like Happy Wheels, the community banding together to make more great abnd original levels, and Young Horses giving new items and new physics to the game.\n\nAll in all, Octodad isn't for everyone. But if you like a game that you can just relax and goof off with, I'd definetly reccomend this for you.","February 22, 2014","true","16.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Let's cover the good, first.\n\n-It's controls are a special kind of awful, but that's the point of the game. The controls are made to be bad, as you control a boneless cephalopod. It makes the gameplay hectic and fun, while still being managable and controllable if you understand the system.\n-The humor and writing are great. If you like surrealist humor and snappy quotes, this game's writing will appeal to you. Also, the titular character is very likeable, for what he is.\n-Similarly to Valve's Portal series, the supply of quotes for each stage is full. You'll only run out of clever commentary if you're stuck on a level for longer than you should be.\n-For a game with about four voice actors, this game's acting is impressive.\n-The references are very nice, ranging from nods to other games ("MintCraft"), to even YouTubers ("Total Biscuits")\n\nNow, let's go over the less good.\n-The graphics, while being charming and pleasantly cartoony, are very unimpressive. The human characters' eyes very rarely seem to move, and the textures are very simple.\n-The game is very, very brief. It can be beaten in one sitting, if you know how to play it. Workshop makes up for that, though.\n-The soundtrack leaves some room to be desired.\n\nIf the issues don't overpower the positives of this game for you, then it's worth a play. However, do not buy this at full price. It is too short to warrent it's 15 dollar price tag. If you can catch it on sale, by all means, purchase it. It's still a fun game.","June 25, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After all, the premise is that you're an octopus in a suit and "nobody suspects a thing".  The controls in the game are purposely frustrating, adding to the game's humorous tone.  Thankfully, it was never so frustrating that I felt compelled to throw things.  Some of the earlier tasks in the game were fun to complete.  Most later tasks, however, involved walking (if that's what you call it) from one side of a room to another and picking something up.  By this point in the game, the novelty of being an octopus has worn off.  I would like to say the game is too short, but it couldn't possibly keep itself going longer than it did.  Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a sense of humor.","August 3, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Instead, the game remains marshmallowy and jubilant with antics such as preparing your own coffee and going grocery shopping... with spaghetti as limbs. The gameplay itself is very entertaining, and believe it or not, the controls (for which I recommend the XBOX 360 controller) contribute a lot to the replayability of this game, even if you can't seem to get used to them.\n\nThere's no way NOT to get into a giggle fit when you're slithering through the freezers of the frozen food section to get to the last frozen pizza in the supermarket. Few things are funnier than trying to climb UP a DOWN escalator when--let's face it-- you don't even have the ability to walk, nay, *stand* anywhere without falling. One thing is for sure, Octodad: Dadliest Catch reminds you to stop and laugh at yourself every now and then. Which you need sometimes. Because you're a freaking octopus.

At the start we open with controlling Octodad, as you will throughout the game. This was one of the easiest sections in the game. Finding bowties, opening doors, and throwing objects at glass panes. It was a great way to do a tutorial, but as you walked down the carpet towards your bride, it became difficult. "Don't let people notice you're an Octopus." And by doing so, you had to avoid breaking things. And after each level there was the small chase with Octodad and The Chef. While running you'd have to continuously switch between leg and arm control as you moved objects out of your path. After mastering the switch the game starts to flow easier.\n\nLater on the game became progressively harder with it's challenges, such as the obstacle course in the aquarium. Moving across unstable platforms with lag was quite a tricky challenge, so I had to experience the game with my graphics set low. Also some people might notice the game glitching now and then. Items would mysteriously tear apart when you tried to grab them, or they'd get stuck in walls.\n\nIt's a good little game, sad to see it finish so soon. The script was funny. I purposely took long periods of time to hear what some of the people had to say. . "This is scarier than an ocean full of spiders. . And Tommy!" "Dad, if you left me here, fish would adopt me!" I also really enjoyed the story line, which it's always good to have a nice story line for your game. So when you look past the glitches, the challenges and the odd physics with the default settings, It's actually a rather good game. Just I recommend the game for people who have good patience.","May 24, 2014","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After all, the premise is that you're an octopus in a suit and "nobody suspects a thing".  The controls in the game are purposely frustrating, adding to the game's humorous tone.  Thankfully, it was never so frustrating that I felt compelled to throw things.  Some of the earlier tasks in the game were fun to complete.  Most later tasks, however, involved walking (if that's what you call it) from one side of a room to another and picking something up.  By this point in the game, the novelty of being an octopus has worn off.  I would like to say the game is too short, but it couldn't possibly keep itself going longer than it did.  Nevertheless, I would definitely recommend this to anyone with a sense of humor.","August 3, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Let's cover the good, first.\n\n-It's controls are a special kind of awful, but that's the point of the game. The controls are made to be bad, as you control a boneless cephalopod. It makes the gameplay hectic and fun, while still being managable and controllable if you understand the system.\n-The humor and writing are great. If you like surrealist humor and snappy quotes, this game's writing will appeal to you. Also, the titular character is very likeable, for what he is.\n-Similarly to Valve's Portal series, the supply of quotes for each stage is full. You'll only run out of clever commentary if you're stuck on a level for longer than you should be.\n-For a game with about four voice actors, this game's acting is impressive.\n-The references are very nice, ranging from nods to other games ("MintCraft"), to even YouTubers ("Total Biscuits")\n\nNow, let's go over the less good.\n-The graphics, while being charming and pleasantly cartoony, are very unimpressive. The human characters' eyes very rarely seem to move, and the textures are very simple.\n-The game is very, very brief. It can be beaten in one sitting, if you know how to play it. Workshop makes up for that, though.\n-The soundtrack leaves some room to be desired.\n\nIf the issues don't overpower the positives of this game for you, then it's worth a play. However, do not buy this at full price. It is too short to warrent it's 15 dollar price tag. If you can catch it on sale, by all means, purchase it. It's still a fun game.","June 25, 2014","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sludgegaze/recommended/224480/","sludgegaze","✞ p u k e ✞","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sludgegaze/","16 products in account","Comedy is a rare thing in games. Some developers manage it with a witty script, others with outrageous characters that help lighten the mood, but few hit that holy grail of slapstick laugh out loud guffawing like Young Horses do in Octodad: Dadliest Catch.\n\nOctodad is just a typical guy, trying to make his way through life with his wife and two children, except that he is an octopus and he has the additional burden of keeping that a secret. Dressed in his snazzy suit, most people are none the wiser about his true identity, but suspicions rise when he is spotted acting strange.\n\nIn addition to mouse and keyboard control, full game pad support is in place. I ended up preferring playing with a controller, but both work on the same principles. By default, players control three of Octodad's limbs: two legs and one arm. By manipulating their positions in space, Octodad can walk, run, climb, grab objects, and do all of the things a normal human being does. The kicker is that each limb is generally controlled one at a time, and they are all held together with an elasticity that often sends them off in unintended directions.\n\nThe result is almost like handing a non-gamer a controller and putting him in the thick of a first-person shooter; there is a lot of flailing around and looking at the ground. It takes a certain amount of brain rewiring to be able to make Octodad move as intended, even when the necessary sequence of actions is cognitively clear.\n\nIn any other game, these would be complaints, but Octodad is specifically about being uncomfortable and learning how to function in a body that is almost alien. For some, it may be frustrating, but for those willing to put in the effort, it is ultimately rewarding to learn how to function as an octopus in society. By the end, players should be able to walk competently without knocking things over or punching kids in the face too often.\n\nBeing an octopus also affords Octodad some benefits that humans cannot reap, like the ability to squeeze into tight spots or to stretch out over large gaps. Young Horses built this awkward, difficult control scheme, and then crafted environments that take full advantage of its physics.\n\nWhere the previous title was more of a proof of concept on the control scheme, Dadliest Catch delves a bit more deeply into Octodad lore. Revealed over the course of the campaign are how Octodad and his wife Scarlett met, when he decided to start masquerading as a human, and why the neighbourhood sushi chef wants to kill him so badly. Of course, how he and Scarlett managed to have two human children is jokingly brought up but never seriously addressed.\n\nYou can't fault its originality, though. It's a game bursting with colour and personality, although the chirpy music does begin to grate after a while. It's hard not to love Octodad as he stumbles through life, and the levels are filled with cute references to indie games and developers, YouTubers such as SeaNanners and PewDiePie, and many more.\n\nTruly, Dadliest Catch realises how silly its concept is, and never takes itself too seriously. The writing fits the mood perfectly. Some of the off-hand remarks and terrible marine biology puns are worthy of a few laughs, but the general absurdity of the situation in its entirety is the biggest source of humor throughout the game.\n\nThe silliness is conveyed well through the graphics and sound as well. Octodad lives in a colorful cartoon world that serves as a welcome contrast to the muted palettes of more realistic games. The soundtrack is similarly upbeat and peppy, and it features a main theme that will be stuck in my head for years.\n\nAnother potential sticking point for some might be the relatively short length of the story. Clocking in at about three hours, it ends before the central conceit starts to wear thin. Dadliest Catch does about as much as it can with its octopus limb control scheme, but it (ironically) would not have the legs to last much longer. I personally had no issue with the length, but those who like to calculate hours of entertainment per dollar may take exception that the main story finishes not very long after it begins.\n\nAlleviating that a bit are some optional objectives for those who want to keep playing. Each level hides three custom neckties for Octodad to wear, each requiring thorough exploration, tricky climbing, or some interaction with the environment. Additionally, each level has a par time to beat, opening it up for potential speed running.\n\nAlso included is Steam Workshop support, so users can create their own levels, and a hilarious cooperative mode that allows up to four players to control one or more limbs, requiring an unusual form of teamwork and resulting in an even more awkward octopus than usual. Despite the short length of the campaign, there is enough in place for diehard enthusiasts to keep going for as long as they want.\n\nIn the end, I would not be surprised to hear that the Octodad community is thriving years down the road. It exudes a certain weirdness and charm that makes it stand out from a lot of other titles out there, and there are tools in place for it to live on past the point when the credits start to roll. Though it has some issues with frame rate drops and its approach to control is definitely not for everybody, Dadliest Catch kept a smile on my face for most of its duration.\n\nTL;DR: The long-awaited video game adaptation of The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife.","March 16, 2014","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was absolutely hilarious and it was a very unique concept. So, when I heard that they had a Kickstarter I was super excited! I was very glad to see them get the funding they needed.\n\nOctodad: Dadliest Catch is the fruit of the Young Horses team's efforts, and I was not disappointed. This is a game similar to QWOP and Surgeon Simulator in that the difficulty of the controls is part of the charm. You control Octodad by independently clicking and dragging each limb around to walk, and you can switch to your arm tentacles to grab things. It takes some getting used to for sure, but it is always a joy to see you flop around and decimate an entire room while people watch you, completely unaware that you are an octopus in a suit.\n\nThis game conveys a lot through it's gameplay, which is something that is kind of rare to find nowadays. The gameplay augments everything that is there, and it really makes you feel like someone trying to fit in but having a really difficult time of doing so. When things get rough, you can really feel the tension in the situation as you try to scramble your way to safety.\n\nI recommend this game highly, however I had some gripes with it, which are mostly technical.\n\nI found myself sometimes getting caught on the physics, like I would try to climb something or move out of a bathroom stall and Octodad would get wedged in the floor or in the wall. Granted, this is something to be expected of a character that is constantly ragdolled and puppeteered, but it can definitely be aggrivating.\n\nI also found the game would hang frequently. This isn't an issue of my hardware being up to snuff either, as my machine is fairly powerful and I can play more graphically intensive games with no problem. This is probably due to some poor optimization and the constant physics simulation. It sometimes made it annoying to playthrough.\n\nThe Story is also pretty short, I was able to complete it within 2 hours. The game isn't too expensive however so this is a bit more excusable, but you may want to wait for a sale, as this is probably better suited for the $5 price range. It is worth noting however that there is also Steam Workshop support and a full fledged tool to make your own Octodad levels. It's kind of awesome, though there hasn't been much content made for it yet. If you are interested in this kind of thing though you might find yourself occupied for quite some time.\n\nDespite these problems though, Octodad is a really charming, fun, and unforgettable experience.","February 3, 2014","true","5.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gameplay is very short (around 2hrs) but is enjoyable and very funny throughout. The only complaint is the camera angles can be a bit quirky sometimes which can be a little frustrating. Otherwise a very funny and original game, a little on the pricey side so wait for a sale!

After having completed the new Octodad, I feel like a few parts of the game design had missteps towards the end of it but it still maintained the fun and silly atmosphere it sprang from. The beginning and middle sections are fantastic. The charm of being a ridiculous octopus trying to pass himself as a human is fun to experience. The game really takes pride in the charm it exudes and rightfully so. The surreality of the entire situation is what makes it amazing. The premise is what sold me on the game originally and it stays fresh up until some bits in the aquarium.\n\nSomehow the aquarium changes the game from being a game about the ridiculous charm of being this octopus man into more of a challenge slog  here you find yourself having to master the intentionally awkward controls. I will say as a recommendation, play this game with a controller because, while the game started with only mouse controls, the controller makes it infinitely easier to play. I feel like the challenging bits of it make a little annoying when I don't think it needs to be but there's maybe 4 sections in the whole game where I feel that way so it's not really that detrimental.\n\nIt's also nice to see this game explaining the backstory of Octodad, his family, and the chef; at least to an extent. The original just plopped you into this family's life and told you to roll with it while Dadliest Catch gives you a lot of context and I feel that's a nice change but it takes away from the charm somewhat.\n\nThe game also has loads of extra stuff you can do after you complete the main game with collectibles and secondary challenges; I personally don't care that much seeing as I was in it specifically for the ridiculous charm but to each his own. There are also few bugs here and there which had me restarting a few checkpoints but they weren't terribly bad. The collision can be a pain for sure though. Ultimately, the game is still very fun and definitely worth a look but it's definitely not for everybody.","January 30, 2014","true","2.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/recommended/224480/","Dravvad","Dravvad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dravvad/","218 products in account","What an interesting little game. When I say "little" game, though, I do mean that. If you are relatively decent at the game, then you can probably beat it in 2 hours, or even less. The only thing that really extends the game time is collecting the Ties, which are hidden collectibles, and that becomes more annoying than fun in the later levels.\n\nOctodad is simply an extended mini-game. Technically, I've played it 3 times in order to collect all of the achievements. I actually was able to run through all of the levels on my 3rd playthrough in less than 40 minutes. Most of the levels in the game are short, though the first time playing the game will extend that time because of the amount of work that is needed to get used to the game's controls.\n\nCertainly, if you are someone to get mad over small things in video games, you might not find this game fun. The game is intentionally annoying and difficult with its controls. It will take you a while to get used to them, and even then, you're never really going to be perfect with them. Besides the controls themselves, the gameplay is nothing too special. Most of the "puzzles" are simply to run or climb somewhere, grabbing items along the way. Only a few places have unique puzzles, which are essentially the three sub-areas inside of the aquarium that you visit.\n\nBut the game still holds onto its fun style of gameplay because it isn't too long. In fact, I think the shortness of the game is good. Otherwise, if the game was several hours of the same types of puzzles, it would lose its appeal.\n\nBesides the gameplay, the graphics are pretty colorful, and the humor of the game certainly is silly but funny. I enjoy Octodad's "conversations" and it is hilarious how people don't see him for what he is. In some senses, the hilarity of that is the entire game, but I also think there is validity to people's claims that there is a more serious undertone to the game. Octodad certainly feels out of place, as if his being an octopus is something that is ruining his life. And some people have brought up relevance to people with certain disorders or illnesses that alienate them in society, and it is definitely something similar in sadness. Whether the developers were thinking in an analagous manner or not, I don't know.\n\nI did not pay full price for Octodad, and I probably suggest not to, because it really annoys me when I buy games and finish them really quickly. There's nothing exactly groundbreaking about Octodad, but it is something fresh. At the same time, it is short-lived, and as I said, it would have lost its appeal if they made it much longer without adding something new.","April 18, 2015","true","8.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The only bad thing it is that the story mode is short, BUT steam workshop and level edit tools compensate it (Can't wait to have some more free time to mess with the map tool).\n\nI think my review is biased in some sort, as I'm fanboy of workshop & user created content. But that isn't a bad thing, at least for me it is incredible when devs give players the power to create things for the game.\n\nControls: Top! I love how you use to control the octodad, it is easy to learn but hard to dominate, making the whole game experience good to play. I've played on a controller and so I recommend you to play it.\n\nMusic: Great! I loved the main theme, the audio fits very well throught the game.\n\nPlot: Man, I loved it, I wished there was more routine situations involving Octodad. If it was a saturday morning cartoon I would watch EVERY SINGLE EPISODE!

The multiplayer is fun, with multiple players controlling his limbs at once, and the Steam community is brimming with user generated content, so that'll keep you coming back.

But they fail to notice the steam workshop that this game has, For now it only contains few items. But after a while I'm sure people will bring HOURS of new and fun content to the game. Trying to find and collect all the different ties (without a walkthrough) will probably add another hour to the game.\n\nThe game's worth shouldn't also be calculated by length, It has a nice story and some cool mechanics. Of course the controls are sometimes a pain to handle (but you're an octopus, that's what it's all about).","January 30, 2014","true","13.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It can be a little challenging at times, but with no major penalties for losing it can be fun for any skill level. I payed $12 and my first playthrough was 2 hours (make of that what you will). I plan to play again to collect all the ties and achievements. I highly recommend playing with a controller.\n\nI give it 4 mollusks out of 5.","February 1, 2014","true","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While it was only a few hours of gameplay (~3 hours), the content was very polished off and was enjoyable from start to finish.  There's a lot of "juiciness" in this game, and while it was short, it was jam packed with what it had.  Originally I was inclined to call it a video game of Chicken Boo from Animaniacs, but it has its own personality to it that made it unique and special.","February 1, 2014","true","2.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
