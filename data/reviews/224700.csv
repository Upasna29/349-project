No other game on the market looks better on my sextouple 4k monitors. The 3D rendering would be challenging for anything less than the Titan-Z in 4-way SLI. But let me tell you it just doesnt stop there; this game even features like; No LAN access, no multiplayer options, Single player or lonely single player versus the AI (because who needs friends right?). Not to mention the beautiful options to only watch the spinner go round and round. I spent a great deal of my time inside, away from my friends and loved ones, to watch that spinner. That beautiful damn spinner. I could not love another human as much as I do this game, would reccomend to anyone who has 10$ to burn.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MuirDragonne/recommended/224700/","MuirDragonne","Muir","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MuirDragonne/","1290 products in account","I "played" through one game of this (2 player, me vs AI), and will say right now, do not buy. Now that that is out of the way, here is why:\n\nGraphics: The graphics are cute and colourful and the board does look a lot like the board game I remember playing as a kid. You can explore the board and find quite a few cute little click triggered animations which are slightly entertaining.\n\nThe resolution is terrible. For starters, the game is stuck in windowed mode and there's no way to change the resolution or even maximize the window to fit the screen. Which means on my monitor, I couldn't see all of the game window, thereby making the game impossible to play properly. All I could do was spin the spinner. The different cards I had to play against the AI player(s) were inaccessible, and using them can often tip a game in your favour.\n\nCamera: The camera is terrible. It starts out with an overhead view of the spinner, then moves to a behind view when your token (car) starts moving. That would be OK, but it then twists and turns around the car whenever it moves around corners or stops. It's kind of motion sickness inducing, to be honest.\n\n------\n\nIn a nutshell, if the resolution wasn't messed up, then the game might be worth buying if you have other people with you to play the party mode with (the store page says "single player", but there is a hot seat Party Mode in the game as well). Saying that, if you're going to get people to come over to play this game, then you'd be best off getting the actual board game. You'll have a lot more fun playing that than this version.\n\nI've been on Steam since 2009 and have over 1100 games in my library. This is the third game I've actually requested a refund for in all this time. If that doesn't tell you how bad it is, I don't know what will. What makes it worse, is that this is a Popcap game. Their games are usually pretty good. It's a huge disappointment that they would make something this bad.","June 21, 2015","false","0.4"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","11","14","0","0"

I hit every key, checked the instructions, and eventually ended up only gently nudging the wheel in an effort to keep the spinner from endlessly running each turn.\n\nNo online multiplayer.

It is an inferior product to what use to be released in cereal boxes.\nOh don't get me wrong, its still a decent representation of the board game, but the version I use to play in high school had full voiced interactions, every couple of pay-days you moved up another decade (yes, the years played a role). Your 'family' was all fully rendered and every single square you landed on had an animation or funny joke.\n\n\n\nEven common gameplay mechanics were taken out from this version: life tiles mean almost nothing now, you don't buy insurance, your career does not matter as much. I liked the fact that your salary increased over time, but honestly, thats about it.\nYes, its nice that they included elementts from "risky road" and "safe paths" or "the family route" but thats not saying much.\nI love board games, all board games, and while this is a decent version for its price, they probably could have released the cereal box version made almost a decade ago and no one would have minded or been the wiser.\n\nYes, the features were all bells and whistles, but when your trying to sell people on playing a $20 board game with $10 software it may be beneficial if you atleast added all the variety and features that the actual board game had.\n\n\n\nI'd give this a 6.5/10  its good and all, and worth its price.

It's a big part of the game, but you don't see Monopoly as a huge close up of the dice. Makes no sense honestly. There's a party mode if you can pry some of your turned up friends to sit and mash on the keyboard with you.

The choices in the option menu are for game sound and music on/off and then you can chose the number of AI players. The usual start happens, Career or Collage and depending on that choice you pick a card or two and choose you job, in most cases (for me) the choice was all random luck. You spin the spinner and most of the balance of the game is just spining, the tiles you land on give few choices.\n\nThere is the option to choose a lucky number and to see the map layout but it's not very good nor are there any real details on the upcoming tiles ahead of you. I would consider this version a very cut down one with little gameplay or strategy involved, you get very few choices, like getting married, in one boxed version I have you can choose to not get married, in here there is no choice, things are pre-set and you take what it gives you.\n\nI say this is for the person that wants to do a quickie game before bed (it only lasted about 20 or so minutes for me with 1 AI) to finish off the night.  The game is worth a couple dollars ($2) but no more, I can't reccomend paying full price ($10), I still play a boxed version I bought for under $5 and it has 5x more content and choices then this version.\n\nThey missed the boat on this one big time, it just seems like a "Get It Out The Door" game to make a few $$$ for whoever, that's my take on this game.\n","January 20, 2015","false","0.3"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Multiplayer mode is rather awkward and involves a lot of waiting, but single player mode is quite fun.  Screen resolution plays a big role in how this game will appear on your monitor, some animations and events are more tedious than anything, but, all in all, this is a good way to pass an hour or so.","October 8, 2015","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is just the classic veison of the board game. This game should have achievements and trading cards. It would make the game less boring.","December 27, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
