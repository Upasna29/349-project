The overall game is very basic with very few strategic moves, there are 60 levels in the campaign which can be played in singleplayer or local co-op.\n\nPositives:\n+Fun gameplay.\n+Weapon variety and weapon teirs that unlock through beating the campaign.\n+Nice colourful artwork.\n+Different game modes in co-op + duels against other players again in local co-op.\n+Each map has it's own strategies which play out by throwing your opponents off the map or by finding areas which are easy to exploit for a lot of hits.\n+A few nice mechanics which make the game better.\n\nNegatives:\n-Very repetitive levels with only 3 game modes not including bosses.\n-Spamming sound effects when hitting multiple targets.\n-Only like 6 maps which are fun but there are maps that are similar to one another.\n-In terms of combat there is no real strategic way of fighting, just sort of whoever gets the most hits in wins.\n-Overly simple controls which are just A and D or Left Arrow and Right Arrow because originally this was a tablet port.\n\nBoth:\n+&- Game is very short and can be beaten in like 4 hours but then again the price is only 7 dollars.\n+&- Bosses are just giant versions of the normal enemy which isn't a bad thing but I would have liked to see maybe some special moves or something.\n\nAdded Notes:\nThe game itself isn't the most spectacular game on steam at the moment and it probably won't be any time ever. It's still worth grabbing to play with a friend or just for playing the singleplayer. I do hope that maybe the developers will add a bit more content to make the game really worth it but since it was like I said originally a tablet port which was based of a flash game, I doubt it.\n\nOverall I rate this game a  6/10  pick it up if you have a few spare bucks, grab a friend and try to beat the campagin or smash his face in the duel mode.","May 31, 2015","true","6.9"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","32","42","0","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/comacoma/recommended/360130/","comacoma","that's what she said","http://steamcommunity.com/id/comacoma/","1794 products in account","It'd be a cheap fun little game if it wasn't that underdeveloped, it feels like a proof-of-the-concept. It's could be excusable for 1 buck game. There is campaign mode, duel and surival modes which can be playable by one or two local players. Which seems like a lot of bang for a buck, but it's not. The main issues are:\n\n1) Serious lack of variety in gameplay. It's core mechanic is very enjoyable and easy pick up yet hard to master, but there isn't anything else to add any depth. It's a game of two buttons... and a single trick. Even bosses are the same enemies but big, so boss fights are exactly the same as any other fight. Campaign consist of four chapters, each chapter is devided into dozens of fights, but actually can be beaten in 20 minutes, thus drawing campaign as 2 hours of extremely repetitive action which you might be bored even before you beat the first chapter. Local co-op as always saves the day by some degree. You all know how even terrible games are kinda fun when played with friend, humans are social beings. And it's not even a bad game. But this is also where the next problem is:\n\n2) Controller works only in-game, you constantly need keyboard to use menus. It diminishes local co-op because it's basically removing 'couch' from 'couch multiplayer'. I dunno if there is anyone who likes to play local coop in the office or on notebooks... maybe there is, but it's not me. Also there is a launcher for settings instead of proper in-game menus, yeap standard Unity engine launcher that a lot of commercial games remove as soon as there is proper options implemented. It works, but, as always, it means devs didn't bother to tune their game for seamless experience on PC. Yea, and the game doesn't allow for any analog axes to be mapped.\n\nOn the side note, there is some problems with achievements, and lack of trading cards. I personally can't care less about both, but some people might find it dissappointing.\nThe game is great foundation to be expanded upon, too bad developer hasn't put more effort into actually building anything worth buying. And moreover absolutely abandoned it.\n\np.s.: Sorry for broken english, not my main tongue.","September 2, 2015","false","0.6"," 16 of 21 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","16","21","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antigravities/recommended/360130/","antigravities","Alexandraa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antigravities/","3041 products in account","Cloud Knights is supposed to be a game where you move and hit using only your sword. I will say that the idea gets creativity points. However, it is EXTREMELY boring and repetitive, at least in the first 20 minutes. It's usually a couple of rounds of "kick these enemies' asses", a round of "defend this pink knight from the same enemies", and then you unlock a weapon. That's literally all this game is.\n\nWorth $5? No. Worth what I traded for it? Maybe. But definitely don't buy this at full price.\n\n(I died twice in my entire time of playing, and it was because the game's physics glitched out and I was flying off the map)","September 10, 2015","false","0.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

Using a sword or axe to vault left or right you pick up speed and wreck your foes!\n\nPros:\n-Physics based sword swinging combat is easy to pick up and satisfying to play around with.\n-Campaign of 60 levels to fight through alone or with a friend (Local 2p co-op)\n-Different platforms each with their own challenges\n-Well animated and solid sound effects\n-Each solo level is pretty fast paced\n-Fun to fight against a friend\n-Achievements!\n-No pointless story attached, just combat!\n\nCons:\n-Lack of variety in enemies and solo campaign objectives\n-No character customization\n-No special skills (just attacking left or right)\n-No online co-op available\n-First boss fight disappointing\n-3 star ranking system for each level screams iPad port\n\nOverall:\n-Despite my concerns about variety and customization I had a lot of fun hacking away through the solo campaign.  The combat is different but in a good way.  I can easily see this being a fun game to play with friends while drinking as the rounds are quick and it gets you right into the action.\n","April 27, 2015","true","2.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","2"

But it's a lot of fun.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_N1pybM3gu4\n\nSwing and slash your way to victory on the floating arenas of Cloud Knights! Pick your weapon and use it to hack at the enemies and move across the game world. The physics-based controls allow the characters to move and fight by simply swinging their weapon. All game modes can be played by up to two players locally. Save fellow knights, defeat the invading Undead Legions and crush your mightiest opponents in boss fights. - Recommended!","May 3, 2015","true","0.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

But if money's no issue (or if it's on sale), I think this is a really unique title worthy of an hour of your time (or more if it ends up clicking with you).\n\nYour only controls are left and right. You "walk" on your weapon by swinging it in huge circles, lifting yourself off the ground like a continuous pole vault. Kill the enemies while not falling off the platform. Several different weapons that behave differently. That's it. VERY unique but very simple.","February 24","true","0.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
