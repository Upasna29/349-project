Decent graphics with superb artistic direction and a fitting soundtrack set the ambiance.  There is a captivating world to explore, rife with a subtle-but-present wealth of lore and history.  The gameplay can range from stealthy-pacifist style to murderous-warrior style, or somewhere in between; it is easy to find a playstyle that suits your preferences.  There is much to like.\n\nThe atmosphere of the game is really its heart and soul.  The gameworld is masterfully crafted to be immersive and intriguing as you explore your way through the campaign.  Wandering through side passages and windows, you not only find collectibles and items but also notes and books which provide lore and background information.  This supplements the primary storyline and few sidequests that compose the main narrative.  That narrative being enticing and well-told, although not without a few clichés.\n\nThe gameplay is structured to offer varying, branching options to choose from as you progress toward your goal.  In each level, there are various paths to take and various ways to take them. You could blow open the front door and slaughter everyone or you can slip through an attic window and never allow your presence to be known.  A lot of games try to offer this, but Dishonored is exceptional in how balanced the gameplay is to truly allow for both stealth and loud options.  It does lean slightly toward stealth, undoubtedly, but you really have a lot of freedom to get creative in how you want to go about each mission.\n\nAnother premiere aspect of the game, tying together the atmosphere and gameplay, is the evolving gameworld.  Depending on your methods of completing earlier missions, as you get deeper into the campaign the gameworld changes to reflect how your actions have impacted society.  The effects are ultimately rather subtle, but contribute to further highlight the outstanding atmosphere of the game.\n\nThe various styles of play and mission paths combined with achievements and collectibles make for some good replay value and decent playtime.  If you explore and immerse yourself in the lore, the game can be quite substantial; if you bulldoze through the main campaign, the game can be quite short.  Also the DLC can add a decent amount of content, so the GOTY edition is probably a good bet if you are looking to maximize gameplay hours.\n\nFollow my curation page to see more of my recommendations!","November 15, 2015","true","38.6"," 365 of 395 people (92%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","92","365","395","20","2"

It does everything right. You have a diverse arsenal of weapons and powers at your disposal in your story of revenge. As Corvo Attano, you put the mask of an assassin in a city tormented by chaos. Your way of dealing with problems will influence the city, since killing will take chaos to new levels or being a pacifist will get you a happy ending. Level design is well thought, so being the good guy is not impossible but rewarding, while being the bad guy is really fun. The chaotic play style is the one where you'll fully enjoy your ablities and their upgrades, but as you progress that way, things get harder, as the game adapts to you to be challenging. Assassinating your targets is fun, but handlling things peacefully is actually more attractive, as you'll deal with fascinating NPC's . If you'll take your time to explore, you'll get to know an engorssing world. Overall, this game is a gem that deserves everyones attention and while it is kind of short(I didn't wanted it to end) the score of 9.4 does it justice.","February 1, 2014","true","21.4"," 306 of 328 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","306","328","0","5"

The stealth mechanics are pretty close to perfect, with leaning around corners, clearly visible alert warnings and a multitude of clever ways to get around without being seen, http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=304088002but it falls apart a bit in the combat. Corvo is heralded as a master of arms, able to 'beat three men at once', as a guard can be heard saying. Ironically, fighting more than one person at a time can be infuriatingly difficult. And that's on moderate settings.\nBecause almost all NPCs use a combination of sword and pistol, you can cross swords only to be shot at point blank range by someone you can't stop, they can kick you; an unblockable attack that deals as much damage as a bullet, or they can just swing their sword as you jump backwards out of range and hit you anyway. Their sword range is about three times the length of their sword and you must block every single hit.\n\nThe killy death tools are nicely varied, allowing for very stylish kills with grenades, crossbow bolts and shrapnel mines, and that's not even touching on the supernatural powers. Adding them, the game becomes a flowing action of combat adding a clever third dimension to swordplay (at least the way I fight). Aside from just jumping and teleporting high, time manipulation, rat control and blasts of wind are just some of the tricks you can use.\nAdmittedly, you'll probably find one or two powers that you use more than the others, but the options are there to experiment.\n\nWhile the story can be a bit predictable, it serves as a good framing device to take you across the breadth of Dunwall, killing and stalking people of all kinds. Also all of the cutscenes are skippable for those who want to try speedruns.\n\nThe DLC is an interesting topic, allowing a new perspective on the story as well as some different powers and amazing sprawling levels.\n\nThe downside of these slow, stealth-based games is they can be lacking in F**k Yeah moments, but Dishonored makes up for that in lasting enjoyment, http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=304087909\nreplayability and a world that you can be lost in for days.","March 17, 2015","true","41.1"," 225 of 240 people (94%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","94","225","240","15","4"

He is the bodyguard of the Empress of the Isles but you are framed for her murder and now have to become an assassin to seek revenge and save her daughter who was kidnapped in the process.\n\nYou are freed from prison by the Loyalists who are a resistance group that seek to take the city of Dunwall back. Your first night out you are visited by a mysterious character called The Outsider while you sleep. He burns his mark on your hand and imbues you with special powers to help you through your missions.\n\nThese missions can be completed in a variety of ways. You can sneak through all the levels without killing anyone or go ahead and kill them all. Why not try a little of both if you feel like it. The only thing is the more you kill the more chaos will ensue. With more chaos you’ll see more rats and more plagued citizens. There are also small side missions you can complete to earn other goodies to help you out.\n\nYour weapons consist of a small sword, a crossbow, or your bare hands which can silently take out your enemies or help you in moments of confrontation. Another thing you can do is peek through keyholes to see what may be on the other side which can help you choose how you will accomplish things. You are also given a choice of ten supernatural powers which five are active and five are passive. You will need to find runes to unlock more powers or upgrade them. There are also 40 different bone charms to help enhance your powers or abilities.\n\nThe supporting cast were well voiced and had many likable and unlikable characters. Everyone was well voiced which always helps add to the immersion. The story was pretty good but I just never really understood what the whole purpose of the Outsider was. I’m not sure if I missed something in the end but I felt all he really did was give you some powers and then never explain why. I also felt a there really wasn’t much to see since most of the game was basically in one area.\n\nOverall Dishonored was a great game to play and would love to see a sequel perhaps that may explain more about the Outsider. Maybe even add more missions to flesh the game out some more just not ones that make it feel like it’s just filler. If you haven’t played Dishonored yet then now is the time since the game can be picked up for cheap and it’s worth the money.\n\nBear Rating: 9/10","April 5, 2014","true","20.2"," 417 of 486 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","417","486","0","26"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GopherGaming/recommended/205100/","GopherGaming","Gopher","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GopherGaming/","352 products in account","Not the most difficult stealth game but perhaps one of coolest...\n\nDishonored is set in a world that resembles Victorian London, but with an odd asortment of technology that looks like it came straight out of a HG Well sci-fi novel: It is somehow familiar and alien at the same time. The visuals are pretty good as is the story, and the game mechanics are easy to pick up.\n\nThe AI is generally quite good, except for a minor issue with leaning .... basically the AI will not spot you unless you could be seen when not leaning. This means occassionally you can lean around a corner and look someone right in the eyes and they wont see you. Not that this is a big issue because you soon unlock special powers that make 'leaning' seem prosaic. With the addition of magical talismans and very cool gadgets the game does become somewhat easy even on the hardest difficulty, but it somehow manages to remain a lot of fun.\n\nThe missions are very well done, often allowing many different ways to succeed. You can be the cat burglar or the ghost killer, or maybe you want to possess the minds of men and beast to help gain access to somewhere new? It is up to you. Add to this many different routes in and out of every place and you have the feeling of really being free to do things your way rather than being herded by the game\n\nIn the end, whilst I would not classify it as the greatest stealth game ever made, it is certainly one I recommend to stealth game lovers without any hesitation.\n\nSee my video review here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFhxSBRENDw","January 21, 2015","true","0.5"," 344 of 400 people (86%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","86","344","400","17","7"

On his return to Dunwall after a few months long voyage, the Empress is slain by a group of assassins and Corvo is framed for her murder. Now with nothing to lose, Corvo is aided in his escape from prison and puts on a scary mask so he can enact his bloody vengence on those who wronged him. All the while a plague that turns people into puking cry zombies ravages Dunwall and everyone who doesn't wear goofy hats and live in houses with pianos in them.\n\nActually, that's kind of the cool part of this game, you don't actually have to kill anyone, not even your targets, though to say the methods you use not to kill them is a mercy is highly debatable. You can go through the entire game as a pacifist, sneaking from place to place and watching people sleep without them knowing you were there. Like what I do to you. Your hair smells very nice.\n\nOh yeah, and Corvo gets all sorts of magical super powers that helps me in his quest to steal everything not nailed to the ground.  Such as teleport, and Za Warudo, and rat lasers. These all help Corvo in his quest, though you don't need to use any of them.\nDishonored plays more like a Thief game than the newest Thief, I mean Thiaf. Thi4f? Whatever. Dylan shut up. There is an economy in the game to help Corvo buy weapons and upgrades, the easiest way to make money is to rob everyone blind like the filthy knife hobo you are.\n\nAlthough the plot isn't anything to lose your pants over, it is interesting enough to keep you entertained long enough to make you forget you live in a box behind walmart, warmed only by a fire and Tauntaun corpses. You'll probably find some characters you enjoy to be around, but other than that, you're better off stealing everything they've ever owned and leaping out the nearest window.\n\nShould you play Dishonored? Probably, it's a fun experience to say the least. The stealth is simple, yet fun. The challenge is alright, the setting is cool, and the gadgets are fun to play with. You'll get a few hours out of the game, its definitely worth the price if it goes on sale if you're like me and enjoy not eating people food for a week.\n\nI give Dishonored a 7 out of 4 or so I guess. Hammerhead sharks are born with soft heads so they won’t jam their mothers’ birth canals.\n\noh yeah, and here's a curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#curation  It's cooler than every other curator, I guess you could call it a coolator.\nHa\nHa ha\nI'm sorry.\n\n","December 8, 2014","true","28.5"," 187 of 212 people (88%) found this review helpful 188 people found this review funny","88","187","212","188","5"

Just two hours into it, and man, oh man. It is freaking amazing. I know I should have gone further into the game before reviewing it, but I couldn't resist; the game is that good; and the beginning of the game was pretty awesome. Dishonored is I guess what you may call a 'sneak-type' game. So, on to this review.\n\nGameplay: Dishonored is a stealth action-adventure video game played from a first-person perspective with an emphasis on stealth action and the use of special equipment and the environment to eliminate opposing forces. The world is a series of self-contained, mission-focused areas designed for various avenues of exploration in terms of scavenging loot, or seeking new powers. Between missions, the game takes place in a central hub called the Hound Pits pub where the player character, Corvo, can meet with his allies, receive mission briefings and alternate objectives, and convert recovered loot into new equipment and upgrades. Dishonored also features a few role-playing game elements, though not much. Whether it's make moral choices with a focus on non-linear consequences, or enhance your supernatural powers.\n\nStory: The game takes place in the industrial city of Dunwall, where the game's protagonist, Corvo Attano, the former bodyguard to Dunwall's Empress, Jessamine Kaldwin, has returned from a long, foreign journey to seek the cure to a deadly rat-involved plague ravaging the city. After an incident, Corvo is taken to prison for interrogation regarding to the situation. Six months later, Corvo receives a letter from an unknown force and with their aid, he escapes. With their help, now he seeks revenge as their former assassin to help find a lost girl kidnapped from Dunwall's assassinated Empress, and restore order by killing the Dunwall city's traitor. I must have you confused on some points in this summary, but that's intentional, as I don't want to spoil it for you.\n\nPros:\n\n+Great presentation values.\n+Do you like to stab people? Maybe use a crossbow to ensure their demise? You have your own personal arsenal at your disposal. Almost every screenshot I have of Dishonored is of me killing people in the most brutal ways. But hey, if you wanna talk about stabbing, read this: http://steamcommunity.com/id/dorroile/recommended/205100/\n+Masses of re-playability value.\n+Wide selection of decisions.\n+Different tactics are rewarded.\n+Great soundtrack.\n+Great upgrade abilities.\n+Various, spacious environments riddled with pathways and secrets.\n+Openness of the levels' designs. But with the role-play elements, this game's world could have been more open.\n+Freedom to be creative within combat.\n+AMAZING combat design.\n+Great controls.\n+Good graphics, the Unreal Engine has never looked better for a 2012 game.\n\nCons:\n-A Somewhat short game.\n-System requirements are small, but somewhat demanding.\n-Stilted voice-acting. The voice-acting... some of it is meh; though I've heard of MUCH WORSE in other games.\n-Options menu. If there's something I hate in video-games, it's lack of several options, as with the Metro games. Of course, this regards to just the graphic settings menu, nothing else.\n-Occasional AI and physics glitches. Rarely happens, but when it does, you'll laugh. Once, I threw a grenade and two guards looked at it while walking up to it saying "That's probably worth checking out" only to discover it was their death.\n-Steep difficulty can be discouraging sometimes. Sure, you can change the difficulty any time, but this game is somewhat hard if you make some mistake, like being spotted; even ONE enemy is enough for you to meet your demise, as they'll bring you EV-ERRYEEE-ONNE!! And yes, this skit is from one of Angry Joe's videos just so you know.\n-Stealth option gets trumped by action gameplay.\n\n\nOverall, this game is amazing. 9/10, easily the best stealth game there could ever be besides the original Hitman and Thief games.

The combination of the incredible scope and perfect characterization of the setting makes that Arkane Studios producing high caliber, however you can't say its light shines from all points of view. Leaving much to the "pleasures of discovery" rather than direct narration, the dev team has made a very clear choice: Dishonored is an ode to the meticulous environmental scan that was all too often overlooked in recent years. Accuracy and dedication in every corner that is Dishonored, feature lets you play with immense pleasure from start to finish. Will be bitter for a longevity not excellent especially customers who approaches with missions to do more aggressive. However, the characteristics of the gameplay and the possibilities (also in terms of replayability) from a completely unique sandbox, to leave impressed and keep firmly glued to the screen in an attempt to achieve the greatest degree of stealth. The high expectations are not disregarded: Dishonored remains a masterpiece not to be absolutely escape.","November 8, 2015","true","186.9"," 159 of 181 people (88%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","88","159","181","20","5"

But, it got better and better as the story progressed and is now one of my favorite games.  It has a great story, great scenery and style, and great stealth mechanics.  I would describe it as steampunk-inspired as long as you replace steam with something called whale oil.   It has a 19th century industrial feel to it and lots of wierd tech.\n\nSpeaking of stealth, it is refreshing to play a game, for once, that doesn't force you to kill everything in sight.   You don't even have to kill the bosses!  In fact, the only time I had to use deadly force was when I royally screwed up on a stealth approach and had no choice but to defend myself.  And there are consequences in the game when you continue to do so.  My skill choices probably had a lot to do with this, but I found fighting more than one person to be inherently hard.  This made it alot more exciting because setting off an alarm meant serious trouble for me in certain areas.   I found myself having to run a lot, which may not sound exciting at face value, but it forces you to change your strategy and look at problems from different angles.\n\nLike most games I own, I got this one on sale and it is definitely worth more than what I paid for it.","March 21, 2015","true","23.0"," 103 of 106 people (97%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","97","103","106","5","5"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/3kliksphilip/recommended/205100/","3kliksphilip","3kliksphilip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/3kliksphilip/","182 products in account","The game borrows heavily from the Thief series but in all the right areas. It has the stylised graphics of RAGE and the sword-play of Dark Messiah of M&M. The open-ended level design and assassination objectives are very much like the earlier Hitman games. There's something slightly Deus-Exy about the upgrades and something thrilling about how overpowered the tools at your disposal are. Summon rats to eat your victims! Stop time and run about your helpless foes! See through walls to find the treasure and to track the enemies ahead of you! You've probably already heard about the 'blink' move, but it's worth mentioning again. Yes, you can now teleport across levels whenever you like! Teleport onto that windowsill above the guards and they won't spot you. If they do, simply teleport behind them again and take them down within seconds.\n\nWhat a fantastic game! Recently I find myself getting bored of a game before the end, or even struggling to get into them, but Dishonored isn't like that- once I understood the game mechanics I played through to the end in one long sitting. Give it half an hour and you'll feel at home in the complex and dark world that it offers you.\n\nEvery level is like a beautiful sandbox for you to destroy as you do so please. Just like Hitman, you sometimes go in undercover and can easily eliminate the whole level should things go wrong, but you won't want them to. That's how good this game is. It almost WANTS you to exploit the levels, but encourages the stealthier routes with more rewarding payoffs.\n\nAfter every mission you return to base. Back with Deus Ex I loved exploring, but now I find those bits rather dull as I want to progress to the next level as quickly as possible (only because it's so fun!). There is a decent story if you bother to follow it and your actions are mirrored by the people you're trying to save. Much like Bioshock, you're in for a rude awakening if you think that you can just go around killing people without consequence.\n\nIf you like any of the games already mentioned in this review then you'll more than likely enjoy Dishonored. It's just as fun to watch as it is to play and I have had great nights with my friends simply replaying the same mission over and over again in different ways.\n\nMy only issue is that it's rather short without all of the extra DLC. Or maybe I just enjoyed playing it so much I didn't realise how long it was. I know that there are a lot of things I didn't manage to do in the levels and will definitely be going through it again at some point to try the choices I didn't make before. Give Dishonored a go and hopefully get your honor back. I didn't.","November 25, 2013","true","20.9"," 208 of 249 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","208","249","0","4"

I got it on release and have been sipping from it occassionally like a fine wine ever since.... Holding off from going too deep into it. It's been over a year, and It's time for me to put it to rest and move on.\nSimply put, the engine is similar to Bioshock... The major gameplay twist beng it offers you more story-based reward for sneaking, and not killing as much as one would like.\n\nWhen you don't care about the effects your personal body-count has on the world around you, the combat is incredibly satisfying. Sneaking and purging each level of each sentry systematically and with precision, knocking them out and tossing their snoring bodies onto tables to avoid them being consumed by wandering rats has its level of satisfaction and professionalism as well.\n\nThe art is incredible. The lead artist for HL2 has helped to make sharp, stunning geometry flare out from a victorian setting.... New technology bursting at the seems of an industrial revolution, all happening in a victorian-steampunk era world beset by plague.\n\nIf you can appreciate a game that focuses on skill-systems, player focused creativity and level-flow... And if you can take your time, and let the world of Dunwall seep into your office, living room, or wherever you're experiencing this.... Rather than put on blidners and sprint right to the end, then you will love this game.\n\nPut yourself in Corvos shoes and really dig deep. 10/10.","January 2, 2014","true","56.1"," 145 of 164 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","145","164","0","2"

I pre-ordered this game back in 2012, the trailer gripped me and the screenshots got me pumped... and then I never played it, until recently.\n\nI really can't believe that I didn't pay attention to this masterpiece of a game for 3 years, it's up there with Bioshock and Half Life for me.\n\nThe very first thing that will grip you as you play is the unique world and amazing atmosphere, the game is set in an industrial steampunk city that resembles victorian London, struck by a mysterious plague.. it's dark, it's gloomy and it's beautiful.\n\nThere's a genuis blend of technology and magic in your arsenal and in the world around you, I lightly compare this game to Bioshock because as you progress you will unlock supernatural powers which you can use together with your weapons, you'll be able to bend time, teleport onto rooftops and even posses enemies and animals.\nAnd that's why I like Dishonored so much more than other stealth-focussed games, thanks to all these powers and weapons/gadgets you can go through a level in countless ways be it slipping through undetected or murdering everyone who crosses your path.\n\nEven better is that how you play the game actually carries weight, if you wreak havoc wherever you go the city will become even more chaotic and you'll become more notorious. There's a great amount of player choice in this game, whenever you are asked to eliminate key targets there will be multiple paths you can follow, some even non-lethal, you can literally play the entire game without killing anyone.\n\nThe only minor point of criticism I have is the length of the game, just as I got really immersed I was already nearing the end, and once I beat the game I was longing for more though luckly there is DLC which is really good as well and this game definitely has a load of replayability considering of all the different playstyles and loads of collectibles in the world.\n\nI still can't believe I let this game sit in my library for 3 years, it's absolutely worth playing!","June 23, 2015","true","20.2"," 93 of 95 people (98%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","98","93","95","13","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TakedaYabu/recommended/205100/","TakedaYabu","大名 Tanegashima","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TakedaYabu/","187 products in account","Dishonored is inspired by the late nineteenth-century London and Edinburgh atmosphere that puts players in the skin of an empresses bodyguard named Corvo, who is framed for her murder and forced to become an assassin seeking revenge on those who conspired against him.\n\nAn excellent example of what a good adventure and a first-person action game should be, Dishonored can count itself as one of the top games of its many genres.\n\nOverall aspects of Dishonored\nStoryline plus the adventure:\n\nThe storyline in Dishonored is solid without losing its flexibility and well-constructed, being more than capable of giving players a very deep and easy understanding of it as it drastically changes or gets either molded by the players progression.\n\nThe characters couldn’t have been better selected. Everyone’s characteristics and roles match perfectly with the game's storyline and the situation that is present resulting in a very pleasant experience for those who wish to be part of a high quality story full of events and changes.\n\nThe adventure in Dishonored is something to admire. Despite being at its first look a game that resumes into successfully assassinate traitors and murderers, Dishonored offers in each mission a huge vast variety of ways on how to succeed in them.\nWithout mentioning the numerous side quests and other characters you may encounter, contributing to an extended exploration and adventure that may or not, again, affect your main quest storyline.\n\nGraphics and game play mechanics:\n\nDishonored uses the Unreal Engine 3, with a huge inspiration from the Victorian-Era world of England during the late 19th century.\n\nThe game's graphics despite not being cutting-edge or breath-taking, match perfectly well with the game overall environment and the time period it has been designed in.\n\nThe game play mechanics might look at first slightly complex or confusing due to the huge amount of ways and styles that allows players to choose and adapt in each given situation depending on the creativity and style of each player. Such complexity can be easily be turn into something simple as players get the hand of the game and get used to it with a bit of time invested in it.\n\nUser interface:\n\nThe user interface is simple, clean and it can be easily mastered in a short period of time despite having a fairly wide variety of weaponry which also includes magic.\n\nMusic and the voice acting:\n\nThe music is mostly atmospheric sounds that match up fairly well with each situation and stage that the game presents.\n\nThe voice acting is formidable, it successfully combines the voice in each character to his or her role, to their physical characteristics and way of thinking.\n\nGame difficulty:\n\nThe game difficulty is very well balanced to meet the tastes of those who wish an enjoyable adventure without struggling that much, to those who want it hardcore with difficult and sharper opponents.\n\nPrice:\n\nThe game price I would say is reasonable. A polished game with a high quality adventure with a beautiful story without any bugs/problems to point out.\n\nDespite being only a single player game, I personally believe it deserves its base price.\n\nDLC's\n\nDishonored has a few DLC's with the purpose of expanding the existing single player game play/campaign for a very balanced price making them worth every cent you spend on.\n\nConclusion\nI would rate this game a 89 out of 100 or 4.5 out of 5.0 stars. A game that combines a good storyline, adventure and combat game play mechanics perfectly, making you ask for more and more of it.","June 24, 2015","true","22.3"," 102 of 113 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","102","113","5","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/recommended/205100/","TheManko","TheManko","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheManko/","409 products in account","Dishonored is several years old now, but it doesn’t feel like it has aged a day. It’s inspired by Thief and Assassin’s Creed, but is quite a bit different from either, making it feel unique. It has many problems, but the things it does well are so good they overshadow the negatives.\n\nI’m sure it must have been a nightmare trying to market Dishonored, because it’s hard to nail down what it is in a simple way. In the reveal trailer Dishonored looked like Assassin’s Creed, but it isn’t like that at all. Like Thief, it encourages slow deliberate movement, listening carefully, and striking when nobody is looking. But at the same time the combat mechanics give you plenty of power to stand against any enemy, making it the power trip Thief never was. For example you have the ability to teleport with an ability called “blink”. This totally changes the power balance between you and guards. Despite this you don’t feel invulnerable like in Assassin’s Creed. Traversal isn’t easy, and running around is terrifying. When you sprint it feels like you’re relinquishing control and allowing yourself to miss things.\n\nThe most successful part of the game is the city. It’s brilliantly realized and is what will leave a lingering impression long after you’re done. It’s decaying, with feral rats attacking townsfolk, and deadly plants getting a foothold in the poorly maintained sewers. It feels like you’re seeing the last gasps of a once great culture, where whoever is left after the tumults will have a hell of a job piecing it back together. The rest of the story gives a cold and distant impression. It’s a revenge plot, but because of the silent protagonist it’s hard to engage with it. He has no personality, and the people you interact with keep the conversations to politics, again deemphasizing simple human connection. It’s not “bad”, just cold. The plot twists can be seen coming a mile away, but when they happened the motivations made sense. They nailed what mattered most for this game. The world, the sensation of exploring it, and the power of your character felt completely in line with how the story presented it. I don’t remember the finer aspects of the main story, but I remember the streets, and the people who lived there. It’s clear that was what the developers were most interested in, and they succeeded in making it memorable.\n\nHuge parts of levels are optional, giving you a rewarding sensation of exploration that for example Bioshock never did. If you go straight at the objective you’ll only see maybe 30% of the level. The things hidden away in optional sections are often surprising, like it “should” have been part of the main path. But I’m glad they didn’t force you down a straight line, because this approach gives you a sense of control over the pace of the game. If you’re sick of a level and want to see what happens next, then you can just go ahead and advance. But if you want to take it slow, there’s nobody shouting at you to “move move move” like is so common in first person shooters. Here’s where the game feels most similar to the Thief games, as they also had sprawling worlds to explore. It’s the kind of design that makes it feel like you’ve barely scratched the surface, even if you were thorough. I love the sensation of feeling like there was more to the world than I saw, even if there might not have been. And even if I never replay the game, that air of possibility and mystery will never go away.\n\nTo give the world a strong impression, the graphical style uses hand painted textures and lighting which gives it a timeless look. It looks great now, and will most likely still do so in 10 years. There’s nothing obviously wrong with the style which will date it. Color, contrast and lights all look like they should. While it might be technically simple, it shows how much more important an inspired art direction is over raw technological grunt. Instead of a dynamic lighting system, the focus was on beautiful texture and color. This works well with the kind of game Dishonored is. In Thief you were so dis-empowered that the most terrifying thing in the game was a guard with a torch. Dishonored isn’t that kind of game as you can close the gap and take out guards in seconds.\n\nOne of the interesting missteps in the game is how the branching story is handled. Depending on how you play, the ending changes. This is a concept I find exciting, because this is where the developers are unavoidably saying something about how the world works. Whether you want to or not, the second you express how choices affect the world, you’re expressing a world view. Unfortunately Dishonored feels a bit too simplistic in how it manages this. If you kill people, your “chaos” ranking increases, putting the world’s story down a more violent path. This system doesn’t seem to take into account who you kill, or for what reason. The terminology of chaos and order tells a pacifistic message, that violence is never the answer, no matter the who or whys of the matter. I don’t think they should have exposed this stat between missions, as several people I know felt pressured not to play the way they wanted, because of the implicit messaging telling them they were doing it wrong. I feel they should have kept the branching story a surprise. Then when you got to the end and saw the result of your actions, it would have had more gravitas, as you’d be reflecting on it in hindsight. I’m hoping this system becomes more complex in the sequel, because it could add quite a bit of extra challenge and replayability if the story changes based on who you kill, knock out, or leave alone.\n\nI could go on and on about how good the game is. Like the little touches like how if you crouch and move close to furniture you automatically crouch even lower to squeeze in under. I kept crawling in under tables for no practical reason, because it felt safe there. It opened up new possibilities for traversal other games don’t do, as their movement tends to be more rigid. The sensation of being able to play freely inside the game’s playground without adult supervision is important. It’s why I loved Crysis 1 and hated Crysis 3. The freedom makes the game more chaotic, clumsy and less “cinematic”. But it ignites that sense of ownership of your own actions. It makes it feel more personal. And this is what Dishonored does best. The story isn’t exciting enough to inspire a drive to see the end. But the sensation of exploring this world which is on its way out, to uncover its mysteries, and the beautiful art, makes up for the shortcomings.","September 1, 2015","true","18.7"," 73 of 74 people (99%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","99","73","74","2","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brutaljones/recommended/205100/","brutaljones","Brutal Jones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brutaljones/","178 products in account","Successful new intellectual properties are typically very difficult to produce in the world of game design. The process requires the developers to build all aspects of the video game from the ground up. They have to decide what type of art direction they're going for, conceive all pieces of the plot and characters from scratch, and build all of the technical systems such as graphics and combat from scratch. This is why new IPs are often rough around the edges. Sequels are so ubiquitous and generally more critically acclaimed because the developers already have an existing foundation to build upon from the previous title and they can focus on adding polish.\n\nDishonored is one of the special few new IPs that manages to avoid most of the pitfalls and delivers a diverse, adaptable, polished experienced right from the get go.\n\nThe most noticeable aspect of the game is its art design, which was deftly crafted by one Viktor Antonov, a Bulgarian art director famous for his work on designing City 17 and its outskirts in Half Life 2. His touch is recognizable in Dishonored as chaotic Dunwall shares many similarities with totalitarian City 17. Nothing feels like it was pasted over from Half-Life 2, though. Dishonored is a true steampunk game and Dunwall has it's own feel that's inspired by Victorian era London gone bad. There's a dirty river, loads of industry, and even a familiar-looking bridge. All of it is given a unique touch, and the result is a very immersive world. This is escapism at its finest; be prepared for the Dunwall to suck you in immediately and carve away the hours of your day as you explore every nook and cranny. I haven't been as enamored with a new setting since playing BioShock and first experiencing Rapture.\n\nThe plot is serviceable though predictable. Daud, the conflicted villain of the game, is the strongest and most interesting character. It's a shame he doesn't get more screentime, though Arkane have remedied this with a pair of DLC episodes in which he is the playable character. The player character, Corvo Attano, is a silent protagonist. This is a negative for me since I personally detest the silent protagonist trope in video games. I understand that the goal of the silent protagonist is to allow the gamer to project his own reactions into the game, and I know that many gamers enjoy it, but it pulls me out of the experience when I don't hear my character speaking to anybody addressing him because it's so unnatural. I can't logically connect the fact that my character is mute, yet nobody in the game ever seems to comment upon it. I don't enjoy it in the Half-Life series, and I'm not a fan of it here, either. I will say that the game deserves a mention of its voice acting, particularly the role of Daud as played by Michael Madsen of Tarantino fame. Other praiseworthy roles are played by John Slattery (Mad Men), Chloe Grace Moretz (Kick-♥♥♥), Brad Douriff (Lord of the Rings), Lena Headey (Game of Thrones), and Susan Sarandon (Thelma & Louise). They spent some money on voice talent, and it pays off. The one qualm I do have is the reptitive nature of the guards' canned conversational quips, of which there are few. They repeat themselves regularly which breaks immersion.\n\nThe wasted landscape of the plague-ridden city can become tiresome and a bit grating. There are corpses littered about, filth, rats, and crumbling buildings galore. The design is fine but the pacing leaves you in these types of areas for a bit too long. The more civilized settings in certain levels such as the gentlemen's club and the high society party feel special by comparison, but the pace would benefit from seeing more of the inhabited areas of the city and fewer of the burned out, deserted ghettos. There are only so many ways you can depict diseased ruin before it becomes repetitive.\n\nThe game's graphical muscle won't blow you away if you're used to games like Crysis 3, but the art direction props up the visuals enough to make them astounding in certain areas. There's an old oil painting feel which permeates the game, and it fits the look and feel of the setting very well. I get a sense of great design while playing this game. There aren't all that many graphical options to tinker with, but there is a field of view slider, which is always cause for celebration with PC ports. The game also runs exceptionally well on PC, so even if you're not wowed by the visuals and the art design like I am, the technical aspects of the visuals won't hinder you from enjoying the gameplay at all.\n\nDishonored is fully adaptable to your style of play, which is refreshing in a game that emphasizes stealth. If you're a stealth fanatic (as I admittedly am), then you'll enjoy it here. It's possible to finish the game without ever killing anybody or being spotted, and you're able to accomplish this thanks to being provided the tools to move quickly and silently throughout huge areas. Blink allows you to teleport instantly a certain distance across the map, and you can also acquire the ability to see through walls. Mobility is a requirement in many stealth games, and Dishonored gives you the tools to traverse the environment quickly when needed.\n\nThe beauty of the strong stealth play is that it's balanced by an arguably better combat system. The combat powers at your disposal (slowing or stopping time, possessing enemies, finishers, etc) all synergize incredibly well with one another and they allow you to take out your enemies in endlessly amusing ways. It's a sign of the design team having clearly described objectives, and I was genuinely amazed at how well the game flows between stealth and combat. I expected to play this game for its engrossing, artistic setting and ended up getting the biggest kicks out t's combat system. In my opinion it's the strongest aspect of the game, which is indicative of the game's greater value considering its already great art direction. There are multiple reasons to play this title, which helps it appeal to a broad demographic. It's no one trick pony.\n\nThe only real criticism I have of the game is the clumsy way in which it handles morality. Great games have been bungling morality mechanics for nearly a decade now (BioShock immediately comes to mind), so it's not surprising, but in Dishonored it becomes a glaring flaw because they get so much else right.\n\nYou're informed very clearly that the city will descend more and more into chaos if you kill your enemies rather than avoiding them or knocking them out, and your allies will begin to view you unfavorably the more deadly you are. While this is logically understandable (a lack of law enforcement officials presumably increases chaos in a troubled city), the mechanic unintendedly puts shackles on your ability to transition between stealth and combat. The gameplay seems designed to be freely adaptable so you can move seamlessly between stealth and combat when you're spotted, but it then tells you via the plot that playing stealthily and non-lethally is better. You begin to feel corralled into playing the game stealthily rather than being free to adapt to combat situations if you get caught. The plot punishes you for being spotted and having to fight your way out.\n\nIt's a disconnect in design between a plot that wants to make you accountable for your choices and gameplay that wants to be flexible. A potential solution would be leaving the chaos meter to be regulated entirely by how you choose to dispatch your assassination targets. Then it's isolated to the plot and doesn't have any effect on the way you choose to play the game. It's a disappointing flaw, but it doesn't take much away from a game that offers so much to begin with.\n\nOverall, this game is a beautiful, immersive experience and it should absolutely be played by anybody who typically enjoys stealth games, or games that offer rich, engrossing settings. I'm very much looking forward to Arkane's inevitable sequel to this game.","April 14, 2015","true","16.4"," 63 of 70 people (90%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","90","63","70","5","4"

Might or might not contain story spoilers.\n\nDishonored is a First-Person stealth/action game that is in a Victorian world mixed with very steampunkish things, such as very clunky machinery powered by "Whale Oil" harvested from whales. or as some call it, "Whalepunk"\n\nYou play as Corvo Attano, the former bodyguard and Lord Protector of the Empress of the Isles, who is framed for the assassination of the empress and kidnapping the empress daughter Emily, and now after getting out of prison thanks to your mutual friends, you become an assassin with exceptional talents, tasked with taking out the people who conspired against you and your beloved empress, and find emily and place her on the throne, getting various new supernatural abilites and gadgets along the way.\n\nThe Gameplay of Dishonored is very fluid and flexible, giving you a large variety of options how to approach your mission, silent and surgical, only taking out your target and not being seen, or just stomping straight through the front, killing anyone unlucky enough to try to cross your path. You can upgrade and build your abilities to your liking and playstyle, was it that you wanted to just knock out neutralize your target, or brutally rip your enemies to shreds with swarms of rats, or really anything in the between. It's all up to you. The stealth mechanics are pretty great, AI isnt dumb, especially on the hardest difficulty, except for that one feature, the lean, which obviously allows you to lean to look from corners, but still cannot be spotted by doing that, even if you're sticking your ugly head out.\n\nThe artstyle, character designs and world of Dishonored are one of my favourites of all time. Steampunk mixed with Victorian age art, such as the guard outfits, cities and houses, interors, machines and more.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=430537926\nThe World of DH is very dark, Dunwall ravaged by a rat plague, sick and poor in the streets and guards abusing the weak, the rich living without a care in the world.\nEnemies vary between areas and levels, from the normal City Watch guards to the big machine riding Tallboys all with their own abilities.\n\nThe soundtrack and sounds of Dishonored are very good in my opinion, the music immersing you with that bleak and dark city of Dunwall as you skulk your way across those dark alleyways and bright ledges of brothels looking to drive your sword into someone's neck to avenge your beloved.\n\nThe DLC that this game contains is actually mostly as great as the main game, the 2 pieces of downloadable content that in you play as the Master Assassin Daud who killed the Empress, but having regrets over it even after many long years of assassinations for his living. You get a brand new arsenal of abilites and weapons, from stun mines to summoning your assassin minions to help you in battle.. or distract guards for as long as you need to get past. In my opinion, the DLC story pieces are better than the main game. the rest isnt very significant, the challenges are cool and fun to kill time with, althought sometimes quite hard.\n\nGreat story, artstyle and music, lots of variations and not a lot of flaws, which makes Dishonored a great purchase and a very good stealth assassination game.","June 24, 2015","true","201.6"," 47 of 51 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","47","51","2","2"

Corvo Attano is a quite complex character (also because his personality can vary depending on the choices you make during the gameplay) and so External and Daud are. In addition, the city of Dunwall, with its specific scenarios in different missions, is very suggestive.\n\nThe possibility of having always an alternative option in all missions makes the game much more enjoyable, so you can play completely stealth. But I played it several times, so I could enjoy every final and the simple consistency of having a different ending for the actions you take in the game is something that I thoroughly enjoyed and which can not be said of many other games.\n\nIt's the story of a city, Dunwall, gripped by a plague epidemic. When Corvo Attano, who is the royal guard of the emperess (who was looking for a cure to the plague that afflicted the city from other countries) comes back bringing bad news to the Empress, she is shot to death by a murderer appeared from nowhere and little Emily, the daughter, is kidnaped. Our protagonist is indicted and brought to the prisons of Dunwall and from there the adventure begins ...\n\nI highly recommend it, I liked it a lot.\n\nItalian Version:\nQuando vidi il trailer la prima volta mi incuriosì parecchio, sopratutto per la splendida colonna sonora che tutt'oggi ascolto ancora, così decisi di provarlo.\n\nLa trama è abbastanza semplice e lineare, tuttavia si riescono comunque ad apprezzare alcuni dei personaggi secondari, che seppur poco caratterizzati mi son risultati molto intriganti. Il personaggio di Corvo Attano è parecchio complesso (anche perché è la scelta dell'approccio al gioco del giocatore, che determina la personalità dello stesso), così come quello dell'Esterno e di Daud. Inoltre la città di Dunwall, con le sue specifiche ambientazioni nelle diverse missioni, è molto suggestiva.\n\nLa possibilità di aver sempre un'opzione alternativa in tutte le missioni rende il gioco molto più godibile, in modo da poterlo giocare completamente stealth. Tuttavia l'ho giocato più volte, in modo da potermi godere ogni finale e la semplice coerenza di aver un finale diverso per le azioni che compi nel gioco è una cosa che ho apprezzato moltissimo e che non si può dire di molti altri giochi.\n\nÈ la storia di una città, Dunwall, in preda ad una epidemia di peste. Quando la guardia reale dell'imperatrice, Corvo Attano, torna dalla missione (nella quale cercava un rimedio alla peste che affliggeva la città da altri paesi) portando brutte notizie all'imperatrice, la stessa viene colpita a morte da un assassino comparso dal nulla e la piccola Emily, la figlia, rapita. Il nostro protagonista viene incriminato e portato alle prigioni di Dunwall e da lì inizia l'avventura...\n\nLo consiglio vivamente, mi è piaciuto parecchio.","February 24, 2014","true","34.2"," 40 of 47 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","40","47","0","2"

On the strength of your hands, and of your heart..."\n\nArkane Studios and Bethesda really outdid themselves with "Dishonored". It's an amazing stealth FPS that'll leave you wanting more.\n\nYou play as Corvo Attano, the Empress's Bodyguard and you've just brought news from foreign land in seek of help from the rat plague that has infested the city of Dunwall. Due to unforseen consequences, you are framed and became enemy of the state, hence the title.\n\nThe story of the game is not bad, but not great either, although I love the ending that I got. Some parts are predictable while others are unexpected. I do love the fact that your actions affect the outcome of the story. I feel as if I have control over the game and not just following a scripted flow of events. Plus, making wrong/different decisions add drama and tension to the plot which makes you careful in deciding what to do next.\n\nVisuals are smooth and well-made. It's using the Unreal Engine 3 so you'll find it somehow similar to the cartoony nature of Bioshock Infinite, but darker. I honestly prefer the atmosphere of Dunwall to Columbia, for reasons I am not entirely sure of :/ Ambience wouldn't be complete without music, and it fits very well with the visuals. It's by no means the best, but it's just perfect for the game.\n\nNow, I wasn't really a fan of the stealth genre but "Dishonored" made me think otherwise. It's fun, smooth and rewarding. You wield a sword in one hand and a Charm/Pistol/Crossbow/Trap/Grenades in another. It's kind of confusing to sort them all out, but once you do, it's fast and easy ^_^ Speed and silence is key, this game rewards you for not attacking enemies head-on because once you do, they will outnumber you in a matter of seconds. I love how you can play the game at your own pace, you have to go from point A to point B, but it gives you freedom how to get there e.g. Use the rooftops and go unnoticed by ground forces, or use the shadows to slide past your enemies, or explore the area to find hidden passages. You're given the tools, and it's up to you, how you want to use them.\n\nOverall Experience: This was honestly one of the best games I've played so far. I just love the freedom it gives you in gameplay and the astounding atmosphere it sets you in. You don't need a high-end PC to play this game, it's very well-optimized and that's always a plus for me ^_^ I highly recommend "Dishonored" even if you're not a big fan of stealth.\n\nTip: Explore the surroundings..... you'll find untold stories that add to the ambience of the game.","January 15, 2014","true","42.2"," 29 of 31 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","29","31","0","1"

Well, simply said, before, I have never though that I will be ever touching this game. But my boyfriend made me think otherwise (thank you). So I had to purchase this game, and I couldnt leave it for a good, solid week.\n\n> Awesome atmosphere! Steampunk, dark, gloomy city in the middle of an epidemic.\n> Very well written characters! The main character in the base game is a "silent protagonist", so he obviously, does not speak, but it does not even matter.\n> You affect the world as you play. If you make too much mess, the city will become more and more deadly to you. And otherwise.\n> Very short though.\nThe main story can be completed in 8 to 10 hours if you play it for the first time.\nI have completed the game in 4.5 hours while going full stealth run, second time after. Knowing some shortcuts (no glitches)\n> The DLC is worth getting.\nThere are DLC that will expand your story! You will enter the opposite side of the storyline.\n> Very interesting artstyle. Peoples faces will make you giggle sometimes.\n\nWell, what could I say more about the story. Its mostly the story YOU will make out of this game.

You know all those games that boast "multiple choices" and "multiple endings"? You know how whenever they say that 99% of the time the choices are meaningless and the endings are decided by a quick "yes or no" question at the end?\n\nDishonored is nothing like that. Every choice you make, every person you help, every thing you kill has an impact on the the story and gameplay. For example, the more people you kill will make more rats and "zombies" (called Weepers in game) appear in later levels. Not to mention that depending on who you kill could hugely affect other characters, and they remember. They will mention it multiple levels later. If you help them, they remember and pay you back later on.\n\nThis all may seems simplistic in nature, but how the game plays and handles it is all the best I've ever seen. The multiple choices doesn't feel like a gimmick, it feels like the game was made around it.\n\nSo lets talk how the game actually plays. It's a really good stealth game. Each level is very open allows TONS of options with how you want to go with things. Every level I felt like I was the first to ever go the way I did, that I discovered a new weird route, though in reality, the developers made that one of the paths available.\n\nIt's not that long, about 14 hours, (and that's with doing almost all of the side-quests) but I know that you'll end up playing it much more than that. There is SO much replay value. It was the first game that I was really excited to replay it, before I had even finished it the first time.","May 29, 2015","true","39.8"," 24 of 24 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","24","24","0","1"

Well then you're out of luck, 'cos in this game, they're more of a subliminal message flash than a loading screen. I probably didn't even get to read the majority of the loading screen tips.\n\nA very Assassin's Creed-like game, if Assassin's Creed were capable of producing a story you actually cared about.\n\nAs predictable as the story can be (Really, we're achieving all our goals this early? That seemed a bit easy, I wonder!), I found myself connecting with it, with Corvo, with Emily, with poor, ol' Sam. The game isn't just about calculated choices to achieve ends that I want. I found myself passionately hating certain characters. I felt disappointment when I realised I won't get to put a knife through their eyes. I felt mercy after hearing the tale of another character. And so it goes.\n\nAnd if you want a bit more challenge, play through the game without killing anyone, or being detected - and not just because of the associated achievements. There's genuine focus and thought necessary to clear out clusters of enemies. Figuring out the enemy patrol patterns, best angles of approach and the timing. Heck, I probably spent a good hour clearing out one part of Flooded District, home to the Assassins. I felt genius anxiety about there being an assassin around the next corner or on the next rooftop, and very overlapping patrols/sightlines.\n\nOverall, it's a great game with a less-than-original story that is presented incredibly well. The combat mechanics aren't the greatest if you just run around with knife and pistol, but once you start being a bit more creative, you can have loads of fun decimating piles of Watch Guards. Just do yourself a favour and reconfigure the combat controls, blocking with Mouse2, Sword attack with Mouse1 and Power/Gadget on a thumb button of preference worked really well for me.","April 18","true","31.7"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","26","28","2","0"

Hyperbole aside, I'm not even kidding.\n\nDishonored places you in the very capable hands of the Empress of Dunwalls head bodyguard Corvo Attano. The game begins with everything very calm and rather jovial. The empress's daughter Emily even invites you to play hide and seek as a form of a tutorial. Soon after the Empress is attacked by assassins and Corvo easily fends the first few off, however one succeeds after restraining Corvo and quickly vanishes leaving Corvo lying next to the slain Empress. Thus, 'Dishonored' begins.\n\nNear the beginning of the game you're greeted by someone known as the Outsider. He grants you the ability of magic to include teleportation, seeing through walls, among other things. For obvious reasons, he remains elusive throughout the game.\n\nThe freedom of movement is rather unique and something I've not really seen other places. The movement, the narrative and the setting (London-esk during the late 1800's ) Where technology and magic exist together though the latter remains known only to a select few; Comes together in a package that feels unique like no other games quite hit every spot right like this.\n\nAdditionally, the narrative goes along perfectly with the actual gameplay. Each target as well as each objective that your rag tag team of seemingly misfit people assign to you in an attempt to prove your innocence and regain order, can be dealt with lethally or non lethally (which leaves some room for ambiguity) This may seem like a trivial distinction in most games, you might assume that doing either will get the job done and your next task will be marked. However, this game keeps track of each kill, each time you where seen and a number of other things that all go into your overall chaos rating; which markedly changes the world. The way people react to you and what defenses may or may not be set up to dissuade you from completing your task.\n\nI've played through twice now, DLC included (which is remarkable. Some of the best DLC I've played since Bioshock Burial at Sea and the Witcher 3 DLC. I am not even close to joking. And I wholeheartedly think you should play that as well should either having more missions interest you or seeing the story from another perspective interest you) I've taken the High Chaos and the Low chaos route; the game takes the best from Thief and adds more content and playability to make it a near perfect product.\n\nYou can be the stealthy rogue on a mission with a heart of gold or play the ruthless killer bent on revenge and the world will reflect that sentiment. I am in love.\n","January 5","true","31.8"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","1"

Briefly, here's why:\n\n1) It is fun. Not content to simply shoehorn mediocre gameplay into the gaps between story, the developers have managed to make a game where simply BEING Corvo is fun. Running around, double-jumping, and using Blink to explore rooftops... these are actions that would be enjoyable even in the absence of story entirely, and other powers continue to add interesting ingredients as you unlock them. That they THEN wrapped this gameplay in an interesting story is the proverbial icing on the cake.\n\n2) The art. LOVE the art. The character designs are in my personal Top 3 (with Brink and DE: Human Revolution) and the environments are beautiful too. I could (and probably have) spent hours just appreciating the visual style.\n\n3) Open to different play-styles. You can treat it like a shooter and kill everyone, or you can finish the entire game without killing a single person. (Or somewhere in between.) Furthermore, the environments themselves offer great flexibility in terms of your desired approach, instead of just being narrow corridors funneling you along the intended path, like many other games I won't name here.\n\n4) It is a polished, AAA, single-player-only, original IP. If that sentence doesn't make you nod with respect, you haven't been paying attention to the past few years of AAA games and the epidemic of "Sequelitis." It takes real stones to make a game like Dishonored happen in an age where publishers are VERY reluctant to take risks. The fact that Arkane and Bethesda stepped up to the plate is admirable, and the fact that the resulting game is actually GOOD is something worth supporting.","August 20, 2013","true","36.6"," 23 of 25 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","23","25","0","1"

I started playing this game the non stealth way, destroying anything that so much as looked at me sideways. What I love about this, is that it affects the ending a great deal, your actions have consequenses!\nSo, after my first playthrough, where I brutally obliviated everyone in my path, I decided for a more stealthy approach, and it was the most fun I've ever had playing a game!\nThere's so much to do in Dishonored, I'm still not done discovering, and I've cleared this game quite a couple times.\nThat gets me to the bit of the game that I didn't like so much.\nDishonored has a VERY short storyline, and I feel like they rushed it, an extra mission or two would've helped.\nThen again, the story is VERY well written, and it all checks out so well, on both endings.\nAlso, there's a lot of side missions, and non-lethal approaches for dispatching key targets, and a lot of hidden objects to be found, wich makes the exploring of a level a lot more interesting.\nI also love the special ability's Corvo has, the 'Blink' is a teleportation wich comes in handy whenever you find yourself in a nasty situation, and you need to escape. It also proves its worth in combat, when you blink up to an enemy and slash his throat, he'll never know what the f*ck hit him!\nThere's a HUGE number of upgrades and tools that can be bought, powers will have to be accuired and upgraded by finding 'Runes'.\n\nOne thing is for sure, you will never find yourself bored playing Dishonored.\nGraphically, this game lacks very little, the only thing I'm a bit bothered with, is that it doesn't run very smooth on my PC, but that's more due to my PC, I can't blame the game for that :P.\n\n\nSo... to summarize:\n\nPro's\n+Beautiful graphics.\n+Great gameplay, many different options and approaches.\n+Very good storyline.\n+A lot of secret areas and side missions to discover.\n+Combat is fun, but stealth is AWESOME\n+A HUGE number of different tools and weapons, which makes the killing all the more fun!\n\nCon's\n-Short storyline, could've been longer\n-You need a decent PC to run this on.\n\n10/10 -It's a piece of ♥♥♥♥ing art in my opinion!","February 26, 2014","true","130.4"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","19","21","2","5"

You go on a personal mission to rescue her kidnapped daughter Emily. In the dark and depressed city of Dunwall.\n\nIt's always nice to see a new quality franchise. Dishonored is a first person stealth assassin game, where you get the freedom to choose who to eliminate and how. Your playstyle even has some effect on the surrounding world, for example if you go on killing everybody, there will be more rats in the city. Your choices also shape the ending. It's possible to do completely non-lethal run of the game, which is one of it's great features.\n\nThe art style is magnificent, it's a bit caricaturized victorian steampunk. There's also huge amount of high profile voice talent in the game. Including Susan Sarandon and Chloë Grace Moretz.\n\nThe games weakness to me comes from the upgrades, while most of them are inventive, fun and open up different possibilities how to approach the game. Some are just bit too overpowered and make the game too easy and other skills useless.\n\nHighly recommended to anyone looking for a great stealth game with rich characters and story. If you want, you can also play it as straight up action game. While it truly shines with more stealthy approach.

It seeks to be the spiritual successor of the popular Thief series who, back in 1998, had set a very high bar for the stealth game genre.\n\nThe player steps into the boots of Corvo Attano, an elite bodyguard to the Empress of the Isles who was murdered by a shadowy organization of assassins. Accused by the people and condemned to death by the State, the player will follow Corvo's struggle to redeem his name, avenge the death of the Empress and stop any usurper from claiming the empty Throne.\n\nPROS:\n+ Action and Stealth Balance: -The game offers different ways to finish a mission and multiple methods of completing an objective. The game can accommodate player preference, whether they like action, non-lethal stealth or assassination oriented approaches. Use the various tools, skills and powers available to your advantage. Just beware of the consequences of your Actions.\n\n+ Great Visual Design: -The city of Dunwall is dark, wet, dilapidated, poor, disease stricken and all of this are completely beautiful. The game boast a unique texture design making the whole world look like it was oil painted, this gives it a unique personality and a gorgeous aesthetic. The city itself has great atmosphere due to the people and the overall level designs along side the Steam Punk theme. There is a large world to explore in-between and during missions.\n\n+ Rich World: -If the player takes time to explore and discover some of the lore that is spread around the game, (like books, letters, conversations, the different character's thoughts by using 'The Heart' item), the City of Dunwall, 'The Isles' and the world in which it is set, suddenly becomes alive.\n\n+ Complex Political Intrigue: -The main plot itself is straight forward and a bit cliche, HOWEVER, if you take the extra time to listen to conversations, reading thoughts (See above), and go out of your way to discover non-lethal solutions to your main objectives, you will uncover a conspiracy that goes far deeper than what you expected.\n\nCONS:\n- Voice Acting: -The voice acting is not 'bad' per se, but at times, specially with certain characters, it feels kind of stiff or lifeless. Some people might find this annoying since it can really pull you out of the otherwise great immersive experience.\n\n- Limited Non-Lethal Takedown Tools: -Aside from your choke hold (which have only ONE animation by the way) and sleep darts, there is simply a noticeable lack of tools for the non-lethal track. Watching the choke hold animation gets boring after a while. Would have loved it if they incorporated other animation types or different moves for non-lethal takedowns like an inverted grab and choke from a ledge or a ceiling beam perhaps?\n\n-Occasional AI Glitches: -I normally don't put glitches or bugs as cons, unless, they occur more than I would like. I have played this game 3 times already and on each one, I encountered some bizarre (but hilarious) bugs that causes some of the AI to do some weird stuff. Not game breaking though, it's more like a minor annoyance than anything else.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nGREAT GAME! A true spiritual successor to the Thief series, Dishonored creates an amazing stealth system while adding new characteristics and twist that makes it a truly exceptional game.\n\nIf you're the type of gamer who is into gun play than anything else, then I would NOT RECOMMEND this game for you. Dishonored encourages combat variation by mixing ranged, magical and melee attacks. The different weapons and tools, including the gun and crossbow, only compliment each other and it is ill advised to only focus mastery on one.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

The story is good, but it can be predictable, but when the plot twist hits you, it's a slap right in your face and feels, making it personal. Game mechanism is like in any good PC games and the look of the game and characters are well made. Only bad things are, for me, when you mess up badly, and usually all the stealth games are the same.

Within this game, the emphasis is on choice. Throughout the whole game you can choose, to assasinate or detain, to kill all opponents or dispose of them non-lethally. You gain rewards, medals if you do the mission non-lethally. Another large part is gaining Whale Bone Charms or Runes to upgrade spells. The game can be played over and over and over again each time trying a different difficulty, or collecting all the Runes and WBC, or doing the mission non-lethally.\n\nAlthough I found this game fairly short, I was amazed at the possibilties and graphics the game had to offer. Every detail was considered and looked into to improve the gameplay and quality. There are many ways to eliminate enemies, such as backstabbing them, or jump stabbing, or pulling off epic blade combos, or assasinating the enemy with a bow, or shooting them with your gun. There are also non-lethal ways, such as Sleeping arrow, smothering the enemy unconcious, shocking the enemy with an electric bullet. The possibilities are endless..\n\nAll the characters were thought out carefully, every aspect of their emotions and wording showed there personality. The plot is fairly good, between missions you can relax and talk to your so-called "allies", each ending with you sleeping. All-inall this game is amazing and I enjoyed every second of it. I failed in the end, and made a mistake. having known the characters so well, I felt sad for a while.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nBaDum/recommended/205100/","nBaDum","scoobz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nBaDum/","223 products in account","With its fantastic mechanics and grim but dull setting, Dishonored remains a favorite of mine, and a great accomplishment for the genre.\n\nDishonored is a first-person stealth action game set in a heavily Victorian London inspired world where you play as Corvo Attanowho after being betrayed and blamed for the murder of his beloved Empress to whom he served as an agent and personal bodyguard, meets a being shrouded with incredible mystery.. A higher entity referred to as the Outsider.\n\nWith the assistance of the Outsider, who chooses neither evil nor bad, only whatever is of interest to him, Corvo gains 'magical' powers.\n\nDishonored does a great job in balancing your set of physical tools and magical abilities. Neither are enforced. These only give to the already vast variety of playstyles and add through the magical aspect of this game a great deal of depth to the gameplay and mechanics.\n\nAs a silent protagonist, Corvo is an empty shell the player is supposed to fill.\nLittle to big differences in the world are made as a result of your actions in it. Your actions have impact. The way you affect the world is not common.\nIt's not just what you say to this person or that character, it's your playstyle.\nYou dared not to hurt a soul? From that you gain as part of your reward cleaner sewers. Meaning less weepers (a certain type of enemy) to avoid or kill or render them unconscious.\nYou've been a good boy? Good job, little sweet Emily's drawings is that of a happy, sunlit place. You've been bad? Well, you can see that reflected upon the new dark, sinister characters in the paintings.\n\nThis succeeds in making you feel regret for acting as you did, playing as you did as Dishonored manages to get you emotionally invested in Emily's character, and when you see her drawing of you, smiling bright, you smile in real life. But when you don't get to see that happy creation, cheerfully titled 'Daddy' you see the masked murderer you are.\nWhether you choose to see her turn you into her savior or her fear, a tower with flowers and a rainbow or murderer with a bloody knife and a pile of bodies is for you to decide through your playstyle alone. It's important to mention that these specific details are not forced, as you might not even notice them while playing through the game. They are worth glimpsing at though.\n\nThis all sounds awesome, right? What a wonderful mechanic.\nWell, not necessarily. The only reason to purchase any game at all and play through it, is for the sake of your personal entertainment. It's your game, you should choose to play it however you wish to. Now, although I am all for the specific player-action-affected events I stated above, Dishonored has one heavy punishment for the player should he choose to be a bad boy.\n\nPaintings are one small thing. Game ending is another. And that is broken. Unknowingly, you will be punished by the game's ending if you carelessly killed all who stood in your way.\nThis is wrong. This is not a 'your choices matter' game. This is a game you play for the fun in its gameplay and mechanics, for its openness in level design, letting you move on from this place to the next however you'd like to.\nGiving you a bad ending is a needlessly unforgiving and punishing mechanic.\nYour way of enjoying this game shouldn't be a negetive deciding factor for the ending which you receive.\n\n\nFor stealth-action fans, I'd consider this game a must have in your game library.\nOf course, not that you can't have incredible fun with it if what you're into is decapitating enemies or watch them being eaten and devoured alive by swarms of rats controller by you. Honestly, it can be just as satisfying as bypassing every guard without being noticed.\n\nDishonored is a fantastic game. Its setting is an incredible fit. Its mechanics in gameplay are a joy to use and the animations do a magnificent job in delivering the satisfaction of a kill. And while the story may not be the most interesting, I did find myself invested in some of the characters and I did find myself immersed to extreme measures with the world of Dishonored to the point where I found myself reading the different notes and excerpts scattered throughout the game to enrich my knowledge of the interesting lore behind it all.\n\nI'd also like to mention the DLC expansions in which you get to play as one of the antagonist and see through his eyes and reason. The extra story enables you to experience and understand the mindset of the very person who set you upon this stuff for the sake of money and greed. A path which brought nothing but horrors bestowed not only upon you, but the entire city as well. If you were a fan of Dishonored, these are a must-buy.\n\n\nOverall, it was one hell of a ride and I enjoyed it immensely.","December 23, 2015","true","26.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","2"

Although the game may be short, I feel like this is a good thing as the game is so good it makes you want to replay, and as you replay thhe game you get to experience new things you never experienced on your first playthrough, whether it be your first time shoving a knife in a guards neck, or your first time sparing your main targets, the gameplay stays fresh whenever you replay the game. One thing that disappointed me with this game is the lack of stealth equipment, as your arsenal is quite low for stealth, and it makes the stealth route less appealing, however the stealthing itself, and the mechanics of it are really nice and make it enjoyable for me. If you enjoy murdering everyone in sight then this game will make you very happy as there are so many creative ways to kill people using the supernatural arsenal of corvo, when someone shoots you, you can freeze time, put them in front of their own bullet, then after their dead summon a swarm of rats to clean up for you. The story, although being short is really good, especially since the choices you make directly change the story, and you progreesively see the choices you make changing the environment around you, making you feel more connected to the choices you decided to make in game. I bought this game around when it came out and it went on sale for 30$, the prices has obviously dropped since then, but I feel I have gotten way more then my money's worth, and I guarantee your money would not be misplaced upon buying this game\n","December 29, 2014","true","156.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Combat has several ways to integrate all types of play styles, from murderous desperado to a ghost, Dishonored gives you the option to take out enemies (or don't) however you want. The powers Corvo has (which are optional as well) are interesting and help create some of the most interesting game moments, and the upgrades actually do something. AI could be better, but it's passable on higher level difficulty.\n\nGreat design and art direction make Dunwall (despite being plague ridden and filled with a corrupt stand in government) an interesting place filled with colorful characters. The lore in this game is a bit buried, but listening to conversations or reading some of the many books you find around Dunwall will clear a lot of it up.\n\nStory is pretty good, there are two endings based on your chaos level (how many people you kill, alarms you sound, how many bodies are found yada yada yada) but it's probably not what you'll be focusing on, with the exception of Daud (which is why the Brigmore Witches and The Knife of Dunwall DLCs are highly recommended) nonetheless it's a nice part of the game.\n\nDishonored is a beautiful game that still plays and looks better than some stuff getting shoveled out, if you didn't like the Thief reboot, or want a stealth game you can play over and over, I really really recommend Dishonored.","November 22, 2014","true","139.7"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"

It was released worldwide in October 2012 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. Set in the fictional, plague-ridden industrial city of Dunwall, Dishonored follows the story of Corvo Attano, bodyguard to the Empress of the Isles. He is framed for her murder and forced to become an assassin, seeking revenge on those who conspired against him. Corvo is aided in his quest by the Loyalists—a resistance group fighting to reclaim Dunwall, and the Outsider—a powerful being who imbues Corvo with magical abilities. Several noted actors including Susan Sarandon, Brad Dourif, Carrie Fisher, Michael Madsen, Lena Headey, and Chloë Grace Moretz provided voice work for the game.\n\nThe game is played from a first-person perspective and allows the player to undertake a series of assassination missions in a variety of ways, with an emphasis on player choice. Missions can be completed through stealth, combat, or a combination of both. Exploring each level opens new paths and alternatives for accomplishing mission goals, and it is possible to complete all missions, eliminating all of Corvo's targets, in a non-lethal manner. The story and missions are changed in response to the player's violent actions or lack thereof. Magical abilities and equipment are designed to be combined to create new and varied effects.\n\nStoryline is amazing.\n1 of the best games I have played. :D\n\nRate: 11/10","June 17, 2015","true","27.5"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","13","16","0","0"

Unlike Skyrim it isn't as open world but it gives a nice story allowing you to sneak through the game or just rush in and kill everyone. The thing is that the Bethesda knew people would want to just rush it than stealth it to make the game faster but they put a very clever system in this game that fits in great to the lore of this game that makes more enemies appear if you kill to many people and gives you a bad ending making stealth much more prefered. I surprisingly didn't find a single bug also in this game other than a lighting bug on a single model, I found this very surprising as games with 3D models and of this size tend to have more glitches in them.

Of course I liked it, is that even a question? I also commend the game designers for successfully creating a game that was equally fun playing either fully stealth or mass murdering everyone. Unlike Garrett, Corvo is fully capable of fighting guardsmen head-on and there are all sorts of weapons that make it fun, interesting, and satisfying the entire time. On the other hand, if you choose to go stealthy there are lots of little conversations to overhear that further add to the fantastic amount of world-building. You really can't go wrong here playing either way, though I'd recommend picking one style and sticking with it.\n\nThis game has a lot more Thief-y feel than the actual sequel Thief (2014) did. It's a real shame that game turned out to be what it was. Unsurprisingly, I discovered that there's some overlap between the production staffs for the original Thief games and this one. The blood will tell, as they say.","September 14, 2015","true","167.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","1"

To get started, messing about with the powers you get is extremely fun, I personally like jumping off something far away from and enemy, blinking mid air and getting a death from above which felt pretty good.\n\nYou can do some really cool things that you can probably see on youtube, one of which I saw was where during the duel this guy used his powers in a sequence to make it so 3 people die in the blink of an eye. I would put the link in here but I don't want to advertise.\n\nThere's so many things you can do, in fact so many that I played through it multiple times each time focusing on something different. It's hours of fun as you can see from my play time. I stopped playing for a while but I got back into and once again I'm thoroughly enjoying it. That's it for now.\n\nThanks for reading\n\n","January 6","true","436.1"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","1"

[Thanks to HateBreeder for the reminder ;)].\nAnyways... Dishonored went under my radar because 1) It looked like it was sh*t; and 2) The moral choice didn't encourage me to buy it at all (which I will explain why later).\n\nIt's hard at all to give a good premise to a game and Dishonored gets it half well and half badly: The lore is great, you have an Empress who rules Dunwall with it's lords and assistants, a very... steampunk-ish city where the plague infects everything and everyone. Everything feels depressing and everyone just ♥♥♥♥♥es about how they are sad and hate life and lifes hates them.\nThe game succeeds in putting you in Corvo Attano's shoes (the protagonist), a guard for the empress who, right off the bat is accused to murdering the Empress, that moment.. sucked! It was so stupid as to how Corvo (he can't ♥♥♥♥ing talk!!) didn't say a word, he just stood there while everyone said "TRAITOR!" or "MURDERER!". It totally breaks from his character and the immersion of the world. Sadly... Dunwall falls flat as well with all this:\n\nDunwall doesn't have character! (I know, it sounds weird...) It all sums up to you finding a dead body somewhere with a suicide letter because their wife or girlfriend or sister or mother and/or whatever died because of the plague!\nIt shoves depression down your throat every. Single. ♥♥♥♥ing. Time! It's not appealing! It needed (not much, but at least a little bit of) life or joy somewhere, hell! Even the mission at the party is ♥♥♥♥ing depressing in groundbreaking levels of depression!\nThe Steampunk city could also be better described, like how some stuff works for the curious, I mean, how the robot patriots work, among other technologically interesting stuff! Cities like Bioshock Infinite's Columbia is miles away better than Dunwall, it made a great contrast between the superficial perfection of Columbia and the deeper depressing and violent Columbia, while explaining cool stuff you might be wondering (Like how a beach and it's ocean work in a city in the SKY! (yes, that is explained!) Dunwall is just... a background! It could've been a daylight version of Point Lookout, Maryland from Fallout 3 without the skreekers and the Ferals and it would have had the same ♥♥♥♥ing impact!)\nWhale Oil isn't giving the city "a deeper layer of character" like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t reviewers like IGN claim.\nAnyway, after you are arrested 40 minutes into the game, you get introduced into the the very first of 2 major plot twists in the game's story, which I won't say what it is about, and after that, the story starts as it should, a nice vendetta-style story that isn't as good as The Darkness 2 but gets the job done to motivate you into every mission. It really does motivate you, but more because of:\n\n-The level design: it's very varied throughout the 9 missions you get (I sadly do not own any DLC, though I plan of getting them in the (unclear) future). Every character you will kill has it's own... massive property and surroundings. This helps give you a feel of size that Dunwall has instead of just... background! The levels were clearly well thought out and, honestly, seem to be the best part of the game and the main reason I played this game twice and still intend in doing a 3rd playthrough.\n\nThe charm also comes from the gameplay: it's probably one of the best gameplay systems ever made, ever! It feels unbelievably fluid, how you can run and dodge everything while blinking ANYWHERE (real ♥♥♥♥ing level design, THIEF 2014!, you know why? Because when I actually say "anywhere" I mean A-N-Y-W-H-E-R-E!). It's amazing, it truly is! If you think, "Oh, a roof... I wish I could go there are escape that "wall of light" (a shield barrier than instantly kills you in the game), well, welcome to dishonored, where you can actually go through that roof or sewer or door or anything! Kudos to Arkane!\nThe peek system is a bit OP though... by pressing Q (lean/peek right) or E (lean/peek left), you can see what's on the right of the box you're hiding behind, HOWEVER, no one can see you while you are in lean mechanic! (Except guards on the side or behind you, of course. But the ones in front of you, just can't see you, even like 50 centimetres in front of you). It makes the game a tad easy, especially for me, who breezed through the game in both Hard and Very Hard (2 hardest difficulties), completing every side and main quest, which is, I admit, a bit... weird, I wanted a bigger challenge, like DX: Human Revolution provided effectively!\n\nThe story is good overall except for the stupid moral decision where:\n\n- Kill much? = Bad ending\n\n- Oh, you play like the Pope would play? = Good Ending\n\nIt's not well thought out, because killing is the funnest way of playing! Because guess how many of your skills (magic powers) are lethal focused? Yep, 70% of them! SO, for stealth purists who prefer knocking out the guards, you will end the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ game with like 15 runes to spend BECAUSE THERE ARE NO MORE NON-LETHAL BASED SKILLS!\nThey focus the skills in killing when the story prefers a non-lethal playthrough! It makes little sense though stealth is still really fun nevertheless!\n\nBoth styles of play are fun, but the skills focus on combat when they should be more split between lethal and non-lethal. Also, there are many gadgets (grenades, spikes, crossbows, pistols, etc.), right now I am thinking 1 only thing that is useful for NON-LETHAL! Which is the sleep dart for the crossbow. ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ME? It's not very balanced between the 2 styles and it looks like it has a massive identity crisis between which style of play it wants to focus on...\n\nLastly: The graphics! Textures on High are muddy, though they feel intentional, and with a reason: a painting in motion! It looks like it to be honest, like one of those water paiting from Van Gogh. The style is colourful which sadly, contradicts AGAIN with it's feel. If it feels depressing and the game wants to give us a deep sense of sadness and pity, then why so many vibrant colours?!\n\nGraphics get a "good" from me though because forgetting these weird... stuff the devs put in the game, this is still one of my personal Games of the Year 2012 and from now on, my favorite stealth game of ALL TIME, thanks to it's incredible level design and remarkably fluid and perfect gameplay! It's from now on my main basis of comparison. Every stealth game coming soon will be compared to dishonored before my purchase. That being said, why do you think I haven't bought Thief 2014 yet? Exactly...\n\nNevertheless, these "small (on the story/writing/non-gameplay issues part) but big (as a whole)" problems will affect the score, which made me think of what to to give this really good game (a 7.5/10). But from a gameplay standpoint it's really sweet, the level design is superb and the story pretty cool overall (despite the (clearly) rushed ending, that still worked I suppose), making it from now on a stealth game model to follow! 9/10 is the other number is my mind.\n\nWhichever score you focus your eyes, on, Dishonored deserves nothing more than your hard-earned cash. It easily one on the best games on this last decade because of how well it nailed level design and gameplay fluidity and efectiveness, making a "boring genre" to some people (the stealth genre) into a (somewhat) fun and fast paced game, and that's remarkable is so many standpoints, that I still have a feeling of going back and get into a 3rd playthrough and even buy the praised DLC's.\n\nSuch a gem to be honest. Sad I didn't buy it earlier. Still, best 7,49€ I spent in months.","June 8, 2014","true","30.1"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","15"

Just WOW. It's been a long time since I literally FELT this Bad@ss. Many games make you one, few actually make you FEEL like one. I had little hope for it, as many had pointed out that the ending was shait, and that the story was meh at best. Maybe they are right... but the gameplay? Oooooh boy....\n\n- Yes, the ending does suck a bit, especially if you are playing leathally. It feels dark without real reason, just to tell the player, "GIT GUD AND GO SNEAKY U BEACH". I dunno, it feels cheap just for me to never kill (which is hard , because lethal gameplay is TOO MUCH FUN\n\n-Damn. I would hate the way you upgrade the powers if I went sneaky. NOT because its hard to find the upgrades :There are just TOO many ! In the end you would become a little too overpowered, and it hurts the challange of the gameplay if you are a ghost. Just a heads up if you plan to be quiet.\n\n\n-/+ meh story, atleast for me. It DOES have a suprisingly good arc for the characters, but the story as a whole is passable. I personally ignored it a lot, but if you want story, there are tons of texts, background lore, interesting secrets and just a lot of history just from the places you visit themselves. This is a dark, distopian world, and everything mades it clear.\n\nOk, now for the GOOD STUFF!\n\n+ Holy ♥♥♥♥. Even if it makes the ending suck, HOLY ♥♥♥♥. The gameplay is.... fukn SUPERB. Aside from the Hitman or FarCry games, I have seen very little amount of titles in which EVERYTHING is up to you . So, wanna go like a ghost? Ye, you can! Oh? Want to kill, sneaky sneaky? Good for you!  What? You want to be an Columbine provocator? HELL YEA!\n\n+All of the weapons are fun to use, and help ALOT to go your way. There is a great player freedom, and all the gadgets help it become possible\n\n+ The powers. They are so simple, yet so useful to the stealh or combat. While MGS C*ck Eater would have me slugishly sneaking like a ♥♥♥♥♥, here yo can just teleportate around. Its hard to put on words HOW MUCH EPIC IT IS TO JUMP FROM ROOF TO ROOF AND BAM, DROP ON A GUARD AND SLICE HIS THROAT, SLOWO THE GAME, AND SHOOT ARROWS TO THE NEARBY DUDES, LEAVING JUST ONE THAT SHOOTS THE AIR, TAKE CONTROL OF HIM, AND MAKE HIM EAT HIS OWN BULLET. Does that sound cul enough 4 u dude?\n\n+ The art is simply inmensly enjoyable. Instead of durr realism, here Arkane went "♥♥♥♥ yo realism" and made a world that looks like a cartoon of the steampunk ( btw, its a pretty SWEET steampunk vision, with clear inspiration of Bioshock and the novel 1984 ) . Its not only well crafted and a joy to watch, its also well textured. Good voices too!\n\n+Hot damn, dem maps. So many routes, so many aproaches, so many details, so much care. Kudos to the level makers\n\n+ Great optimization for me ( I got a AMD 6900 HD and a I5 intel core) . No crashes, no drops,smooth 60 fps all day baby\n\n+ Good DLC, if you want it, you have a nice deal in the GOTY ed\n\n+Good lengh. It took me 7.30 hours at the first run (I was balls to the wall anyway, might have to do with that), but its sooo replayable, I see myself going back for more.\n\n+Did I mention teleportation? I mean come on!

Let's find out!\nImagine a pretty solid guard who gets magical powers by a supernatural guy known as The Outsider, being falsely accused of murdering the queen... doesn't that sound pretty cool? Well, it actually is!\n\nDishonored takes place in the industrial city of Dunwall, where technology and otherwordly forces coexist. The city design is modeled on London and Edinburgh in the 18th century. With a very dark and foggy atmosphere and an interesting art style, aesthetically it serves very well as eye-candy. But not only the graphical aspects make this game a masterpiece - the concept designs, story lore and mechanics are solid and complex. Since it's sadly not a sandbox game, you are relatively limited to exploring, freedom of roaming etc - but the points above completely compensate to that.\n\n\nThe storyline is a masterpiece, aesthetics are eye candy and an engine that is actually working. Sounds satisfying, right? Besides the awesome visuals provided by the dark themed style - you also get supercool abilities which give you tons of possibilites how to defeat your enemies - or sneak past them without anyone noticing. Different playstyles are definetely possible in this game, and give even the sneakiest rogue-players a good challenge and satisfaction.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/205100/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","If you are a fan of stealth games, then you are in for a treat in Dishonored - a first-person stealth game heavily inspired by the Thief franchise (and a few others).\n\nGoing straight to its selling point, mechanically, Dishonored is near flawless as far as stealth games are concerned, no doubt about that. It has been more than long due to finally see a stealth game which provides such vast possibilities for approaching your objectives. Want to use the rooftop to get in? Go ahead. Prefer getting in through the sewers? No problem. Want to become a fish? Sure, why not. The things I wished Mark Of The Ninja (a brilliant 2D stealth game) could have done better were granted in Dishonored. Aside from common mechanics seen in almost any other stealth game such as hiding in shadows and sneaking past guards, the addition of magic abilities such as Blink, Possession and Time Bending provide a new layer of depth in the gameplay. Although these abilities do make the game fundamentally easier than the old-fashioned stealth games like Thief, with some a bit too overpowered, it is remarkable how creative you can be with them. This makes a playthrough totally different than the next one and increases replayability. Even without its new mechanics added in, the fundamental ones which define a stealth game are up to par in Dishonored. The only time when immersion seems to break is when you hide underneath something, like a table or inside a fireplace, after you have been spotted and the alerted guards stand idiotically in front of you doing almost nothing to you. Sometimes they throw objects at you, but otherwise you can stay there and cheaply kill everyone else near you, one by one. This is something which I experienced not once, but a couple of times in the game. So yes, there are a few AI issues, but these are mostly encountered rarely.\n\nFunnily enough, Dishonered unashamedly took evident inspiration from games such as Bioshock, Half-Life and, unsurprisingly, Thief in its visual presentation, narration and level design. As a result, while its setting may look all cool with its blend of steampunk and Victorian London, it is hard not to feel like it borrowed too heavily from the aforementioned titles. “A City Unlike Any Other” is written in its description on the its Steam page which is a bit “dishonest” – it is nothing more than a modernised City 17 from Half-Life 2. Obviously, this aspect is just me nitpicking it and does not retract how beautiful and well-designed the world in Dishonored is, although you would have expected the person who once worked at Valve and envisioned City 17 in the first place would at least attempt to create something actually new rather than a rehash of his previous work when he moved to Arkane Studios. The point which is being made here is that there is nothing to praise about in terms of originality, but again, that does not make its setting any less enthralling. Graphically, it looks pretty good despite some textures feeling noticeably washed out. Whether this was an artistic decision, I cannot say. Its soundtrack is also good, but nothing too memorable though.\n\nWith an interesting premise, the story in Dishonored is perhaps its weakest aspect. You take the role of Corvo, a bodyguard of the Empress who eventually gets framed for her murder and gets thrown in jail. With the aid of underground allies from the outside fighting for the same cause (finding the real murderer), Corvo manages to escape his prison cell and begins his long quest in avenging his Empress’s death and protecting her heir to the throne. All-around, the story feels only slightly above average – it honestly is neither great nor bad. In fact, what puts it above average is how your actions in missions do actually affect the narrative of the game in some form or another; even when you start questioning how the moral system implemented actually works when the game punishes you for things you might not have done (or was forced to) if you are aiming for the good ending. Annoyingly, the game offers plenty of cool gadgets to use in your missions and you just cannot resist using some when the occasion arises, but indirectly lets you know that you are a bad person if you kill someone. At the end of the day though, if you are someone who does not care about which ending they get or can pretend that is the ending they got, then you are free to approach things whichever way you want, blazing through or sneaky peeky. Anyway, the story is by and large pretty forgettable with its only major plot twist also getting somewhat predictable halfway through the game. Sadly, most of the characters in Dishonored tend to end up feeling not fleshed out enough. “Why should I care?” was a frequent question running through my mind all the time. “Because you’re the great Corvo and we believe in your skills!” said someone amongst those lines in the game, more than once. Well, okey, thanks bud. Heck, even Corvo becomes a pretty uninteresting protagonist due to a lack of personality and the charms of someone like Garrett from the Thief games. Corvo’s only motive is to simply avenge his Emperor’s death and protect her heir to the throne, Emily, a young girl who I personally had no attachment whatsoever throughout the entire time, even when the game forces her on me. Muted protagonists have been done better before, and Corvo is not a great example. Take away all of its story, then you come to realise that what you are playing are nine missions with relatively large environments to play around, which alone I am personally more than satisfied with. Then, does its weak story affect the enjoyment of the game? Absolutely not. In actual fact, the entire game can practically be played without paying too much attention to the story as long as you complete your objectives successfully, thanks to Dishonored's gameplay.\n\nConclusively, Dishonered is a mechanically brilliant stealth game, if not the best in recent years, and a true modern homage to the classic Thief games. It hits that sweet spot in its gameplay. With new interesting mechanics added on top of staple elements from the stealth genre to keep things fresh and a myriad of possibilities to approach the mission objectives, Dishonered is a blast. Where it lacks in story and characters to care about, it compensates in one of the most satisfyingly fluent gameplays and level designs in a stealth game. It really is the type of game where its gameplay outshines everything else, even with its small issues. So if you like stealth games, then Dishonored is for you.","September 22, 2015","true","15.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/recommended/205100/","badwhippet","Moonwind","http://steamcommunity.com/id/badwhippet/","568 products in account","One of the best games I've ever played.\n\nI came to it late, having only seen screenshots with a lot of sword-fighting and shooting, but as usual the major reviews did the game a disservice, because Dishonored is so much more than that.\n\nFirstly, you don't have to harm anyone.  You don't even have to be SEEN by anyone.  Play as the good guy who is out to right the wrongs done against him and the people of Dunwall, and the game will pan out differently to playing as the angry guy out for vengeance - with a totally different ending to go with it (incidentally, I recommend playing BOTH styles to experience two different games).  As a result, there can be a lot of stealth-play (if you choose that play-style) and it's all very well done (though the stealth mechanics are not quite up to the stealth mechanics of Thief).\n\nSecondly, the art style is incredible - one of those games where you just want to take stock and look around.  It's a very atmospheric game, though as usual the story revolves around "white male trying to rescue young female" (like we haven't seen that done to death already) and all the female NPCs are in some kind of servitude role or p♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s (Arkane loses some Brownie points for that).  But the story is incredibly well executed, the world extremely well designed (I must have played this game through some 20+ times now, and still find secret passageways, vents and such I can use) and it's just about the usual 15-20 hours in length.\n\nFinally, the controls for keyboard and mouse are incredibly easy - a delight to use.  No clunky awkwardness with button combos or anything like that, and no having to commit different keys to memory.  The early levels are actually a combined story opener and tutorial.  Again, very well done.\n\nAll in all, an excellent game and one I thoroughly recommend (along with its story-based DLC packs).","July 23, 2014","true","358.1"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CIarkness/recommended/205100/","CIarkness","CIarkness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CIarkness/","132 products in account","This is a review for Dishonored: Game of the Year Edition, that means the review takes in account of the dlc's as well.\n\nThis game was definitely one of most entertaining games I've played. Being one of the few first person stealth games, the control are very smooth and Skyrim-like. I would say the game is worth every penny, but due to some pros and cons, players generally like or dislike this game, I'll suggest you either rent or buy this game while it's on sale if you're "unsure".\n\nFirst, I'm going to cover the background info. The game takes place in a steam punk era, where magic and technology exists together. The main campaign goes something like this, you're the royal bodyguard who came back a bit earlier than expected. Being wrong place at wrong time, you were framed after witnessing your queen getting assassinated and the princess getting kidnapped. The main plot is essentially very straight-forward, linear and a bit predictable. So readers be warned, don't expect Mass Effect level of plot. However, while the main plot is not extremely good, it's not bad either. What makes the plot however, really highlighted and up high on the scale is when you play the DLC's, where you get to play as the master assassin Daud, who's story takes place after his murder of the queen. The DLC's are fairly lengthy and I have to say, for me it was very interesting the way the plot weaves along with the main campaign, so if you consider getting this game, definitely pick up the DLC's or the GOTY edition.\n\nThe game mechanics is what really kicks this game up high for me. You get variety of abilities such as teleporting, freezing time and even possess your enemies to sneak past security. With the amount of weapons and abilities, you have a bucket load of ways to enjoy the game, rather it is to sneak past enemies or to fight them straight up. Here's however, in my opinion where the main flaw for me came in. The game uses a system called chaos system. Based on the amount of enemies you've killed, you either end up with a high chaos or low chaos endings along with some effects on certain missions. I played through my main campaign on low chaos, and I've seen the high chaos ending as well. Honestly, I would highly suggest you to play the way you would play on any assassin games, don't worry about how you eliminate your targets, you will end up getting the most fun out of the game by trying out all the gadgets. Also, the ending is not different by much.\n\nGraphic: 7/10\nExplanation: The graphics uses the unreal engine, it was intended to have a comic and more Borderlands feel to it rather than realistic. I enjoyed the graphics as it combined with the game atmosphere very well, but it's certainly not the "high-end-best" graphics.\n\nPlot: 8/10\nExplanation: You may be a little bit confused about my plot scoring, originally I was going to give the plot a 6/10 after playing through the main story, but since the DLC's really pack a punch and connects with the main plot, I felt the need to give it a higher score of 8 out of 10. Keep in mind for Open World RPG players, this game does not have as much side missions as you would expect, most side missions revolve around the main mission. Providing you with alternative ways to approach targets or reward you with new abilities.\n\nGameplay: 8.5/10\nExplanation: The gameplay is absolutely amazing in ways, your abilities are very awesome, and overpowered at the same time, I however, was not looking for difficulty but rather enjoying the game the way it is. But for you hardcore gamers out there, there's options for higher difficulties. Players that choose to be pacifist or run the game on low chaos will end up limiting themselves over the usage of tools, making it less enjoying than when playing the game on high chaos. But rewarding in ways as well.\n\nReplayability: 6/10\nExplanation: There are some challenges in the DLC's such as the Time Bend Massacre, where you go through many rounds to try and murder people as many as possible with the time frozen for a limited amount of time. This I can see as being fairly enjoyable, but aside from this, maybe another run-through just to see the alternative chaos ending, I would not hold this game high on replability.\n\nOverall: 8/10\nConclusion: Great game, definitely a steal when you buy it on sale, fairly reasonable price at it's full as well. If you enjoy casual, stealth, first person killing games, you would get a lot of out of this game. The game is pretty linear and fast pace, so no grinding or the need to feel dragged. A good game worth picking up when you want a new game.","January 10, 2014","true","15.1"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

Such hypocrisy. Make me look on it no more!"\n\nFor god's sake and hell yeah, that's the good new IP we always wanted when we talk about the  game industry and the big publishers and developers not being creative anymore and producing the same things over and over again. Not meaning that Dishonored reinvented the games wheel but it has a fresh feeling, plays smoothly and establishes a new and interesting world to discover.\n\n\n[Small spoilers]\nYou play Corvo Attano, formerly protector of the empress in the city of Dunwall. Because of a dangerous and lethal plague which ravages the city and all of its citizens without an antidote, the empress send you on a journey to the other islands of the world to search for help. The game starts with your returning from this journey bringing back bad news - and all of a sudden you're in the middle of the story and its conspiracy: the empress gets killed in front of your eyes, her daughter Emily  gets kidnapped and you are the one to blame for. You get send to prison and it's up to you and some people loyal to the empress to recover your honor, rescue Emily - the legitimate new leader - , take vengeance and let justice prevail.\n[Small spoilers]\n\n\nThe story isn't something special or completely new but knows how to present itself and especially the background story scores with a lot of details. It has a clear structure and follows a straight and clear line with some surprises towards the end. During you maneuver yourself through the game you are going to meet many different and interesting characters, who are not typically black and white. In each of them you can see good and bad things and you have to form your personal opinion and find out whom you can trust, who needs to die and who deserves to live. Sometimes you also have to choose between different options in the main or side quest. The reactions to the different kind of choices you made exist and are nice, but I would say they don't have much impact on the general storyline, except maybe the different endings you can get.\n\nTalking about the gameplay, what I really like is the focus on the different heights and the vertical play, so the levels are not only flat, you can also climb, teleport, walk on buildings, balconies, air pipes etc. Besides that the level design is just genius: In each of them, you have several options how to fulfill your mission and get to your aim. You can sneak around all enemies and just head towards your main aim if you're more of a stealth player, you can face your enemies and just kill everything in your way if you're more of an action player or you can solve side quest to get new options. You can become a rat and creep through small holes, you can teleport over buildings, you can manipulate enemy technologies and so many more paths. Because of all this the game has a high replay value. At the end of each level you get a statistic about how you played, what you found and what you did - great for comparing with friends. The runes and weapons are various and different but many of them are just for experimenting or when you want the whole action experience. In my playthrough for example, I focused on the sneaky tactics and for this I manly just used no weapons besides Corvos  strong arms :D .\n\nYou can find tons of collectables: coins, runes, bone charms, books, notes, audiographs, Sokolov paintings , Outsider shrines etc. With coins you can buy weapon or general upgrades from Piero or other merchants. To enable new abilities you use runes and bone charms afford you small advantages. The books, notes and audiographs tell you additional information about the background story, specific characters, their views and thoughts, individual cases and guidance for side quests and riddles. So for all the gatherers among you, it's perfect :D .\n\nWhat's also a very important aspect in terms of stealth games is the enemy AI and this one is great. Believe me when I say it's hard to get through the levels without being seen. The graphics on the technical side are good, but not the best or "up to date". But that doesn't matter, because the strength lies in the atmosphere and the Steampunk art style, both which are very cool and suit the story and the world. And playing it in 2015 isn't any kind of a bummer, the game still can create amazing images especially because it has not super realistic graphics and so it doesn't get old. Sometimes I catch myself just standing on a rooftop  and watching the beautiful scenery. So even for you graphic fanatics it's worth a look :D .\n\n\nPro's:\n+ interesting new world\n+ awesome level architecture\n+ overall a good story\n+ mysterious and multilayered characters\n+ smooth and fresh game play\n+ tons of collectables and a lot to discover\n+ several ways how to play and solve your missions\n+ high replay value\n+ choices to make\n+ different endings based on your chaos level\n+ well done graphics which suit the great atmosphere\n+ good enemy AI\n+ very good German localization\n\nCon's:\n- main character Corvo stays pale\n- too less weapons for stealth gameplay\n- various choices don't have much influence\n- a few small bugs\n- killed or knocked out enemies despawn too fast\n- some dialogues of the city guards doesn't match\n- at some points it can get frustrating if your tactics don't work :D\n\n\nAll in all it's a very fun game and I don't regret any of the hours I've played it. I cannot wait to plunge again into the world, learn more about it and explore new areas. I can recommend it to everyone who likes stealth games, Steampunk art style and interesting worlds to discover. If you like games series like Thief, Deus Ex, Hitman or Bioshock it's definitely worth a try. I'm very looking forward to see Dishonored 2  which will be released in Spring 2016! Till then it's the perfect time to start with the Dishonored series or play it again ;) !\n\n9/10","August 24, 2015","true","113.3"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

So much so they can rightfully be placed at the very essence of Dishonored which revels and is at its best when it lets you explore the extremely well designed world of Dunwall which absolutely oozes atmosphere and character at every corner, but is sadly diminished by its poorly constructed and even worse, poorly executed narrative of the main story which leads to unsatisfying revelations and tacked on abrupt ending not redeemed in the least by an epilogue. This carries over to characters and their own stories which end up being very forgettable and merely serving a purpose.\n\nThings are just as conflicted in the gameplay department where game offers multiple ways to go about your bloody business, but then proceeds to hamstring your stealth approach with very limited arsenal of tools at your disposal, at least compared to a more violent route which gives you much more freedom and utility. There are also customary problems associated with stealth AI detection and rats getting in the way of devouring your unconscious enemies which leads to some no kill failure states. Some of the non-violent target solutions could've also used a bit more challenge and less contrivance in some cases, but it's nothing worth writing a paragraph about and can be waved away.\n\nIn the end Dishonored is a widely uneven game, but one who's faults fail to overshadow the positives in the grand scheme of things. Shame I didn't get to tackle the DLC, but it's something for the future because Dishonored is most certainly worthy of replaying.","April 28, 2014","true","15.0"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

BUT the more I played like an assassin killing everyone the more I saw negative repercussions on Dunwall, I turned half town into zombies and the cops all hated me and that really didn't help my case of being "innocent". In other words: an assassin game that made me not want to kill my marks!\n\nI love this game, it's made for multiple playthroughs with multiple styles: from a completley ghost-no-casualties style to an all out no-one leaves-here-alive style. Awesome. That's what you typically expect from assassin games, yes, but you can also just stealth along every mission without as much as interacting with any of the guards (be it choking or killing them), so: Stealth!\n\nALSO, remember how playing the no-killing game is always tedious for everyone and you just do it for the bonuses in stealth games? NOT HERE! At least not for me anyways, you get awesome options that every stealth game should have (looking at you DE:HR) where you can choke someone to faint in the middle of a square, carry the body, blink the hell out of there onto a roof, leave him there and keep on doing that until you've passivley cleared the area!\n\nYou can either go like a normal assassin or use these incredible powers granted to you, there's even an achievment for not upgrading any power but blink, which is really the only thing I almost always use, though really why you wouldn't want to use these powers (if you want to play like a normal assassin) is beyond me since "falling out of the sky and slitting a guys throat to watch him turn into ashes while his partner is just about to turn around only to see nothing since you blinked away" is incredibly satisfying to do.\n\nNow, granted, this game isn't for everyone, people who like action games probably won't like it a lot, it has a block and counter combat system that I've never really tried out since the intro because I never even get caught, but still, no idea how that would work. Also, I think it has a [necessary] flaw with the NPC detection (at least in normal) where you can have a dude watching a hall and a patrol whom you kill at the end of it and even though any normal human being would see that he for some reason does not, but that is all forgiven thanks to the ability to climb on top of freaking lamps and s**t!. Just, awesome.\n\nBut enough of me fanboying-out, yes, this has become on of my favourite games, and yes I love it and it's characters, with a good enough consecuence system (better than Skyrims that's for sure) and an awesome concept and lore (if you read the books and pay attention to the places you visit, there is a lot of it) you'll surely like this game.\n\n\n9.9/10 If only because it can get tedious to get some achievments since the missions can be rather lengthy, especially for a ghost-&-no-deaths playthrough and such, but I'd still say you should buy the GOTY edition with the extra missions and such, a no brainer in my opinion.","July 17, 2014","true","36.5"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Dunwall, the game's focal city and capital of the empire, is in the midst of crisis. Its beloved empress has been assassinated, and you - her bodyguard Corvo - have the blame thrust upon you simply for being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Her daughter, and proper heir to the throne, is kidnapped by those truly responsible for her mother's death. Meanwhile, the destabilized empire struggles to contain an outbreak of plague, which has been spreading throughout the city at unprecedented speeds.\n\nArmed with an arsenal of gadgets and powers, Corvo must traverse his way through the rapidly dilapidating urban center of Dunwall. Your mission is to rescue heir Emily and clear your name: the mastermind of the assassination has seized power and appointed his fellow conspirators to key positions in the government. It is here where the game begins, freed from prison by unexpected benefactors. How you choose to accomplish your goals will greatly affect the city, others' opinions of you, and the game's outcome; should Corvo indiscriminately slaughter the innocent and guilty along the way, Dunwall will visibly deteriorate throughout the course of the game. Conversely, it's possible to complete the game through entirely nonlethal means - and young Emily will be watching, influenced by her role model's moral compass.\n\nDishonored is unique in that two different people can approach the game with two separate playstyles and come away with two different impressions. There is a lot more depth to the game's story than meets the eye and while the nonlethal ending is far more fulfilling, the lethal and nonlethal routes will yield two very different games.\n\nIf you are a fan of stealth-based gameplay, adapting your movements carefully to avoid detection, you should be delighted with Dishonored. If you prefer to steamroll your way through haphazardly, you may be less impressed.","October 6, 2014","true","27.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IncompetantBastard/recommended/205100/","IncompetantBastard","Unkawaii","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IncompetantBastard/","156 products in account","I deleted my old review for the sake of writing a new one. This is the first game I reviewed and I don't think my old one did this title any justice.\n\nFirst of all, let me preface this by saying that this is, hands down, no holds barred, my favorite game. Ever. Of all time. Everything from the atmosphere to the gameplay to the replayability is just... It's flawless.\n\nWell, in my opinion at least. I won't lie, there are some pretty big flaws with the game that are hopefully addressed in a future sequel. Seriously, I hope.\n\nIn general, this game is sort of the child of Bioshock and Thief (The original Thief series, not the half-♥♥♥♥♥ reboot). It's a stealth-action game that goes through a linear story of ten missions. In addition to this, there are three DLC packs. The first is the "Dunwall City Trials" pack which adds another ten missions, though those are more side/minigames. They're very challenging and I recommend them for pro players who want to test themselves. There are two story-based DLCs following another character on top of that. "The Knife of Dunwall" adds three missions and "The Brigmore Witches" adds another four (though one is just an intro mission, really.)\n\nThe gameplay is where this game shines the most. While each mission, and map in general, is highly linear, there are a countless number of ways to approach each mission objective and it's limited only by your creativity and whatever weapons/powers you have. In the spirit of Bioshock, the protagonist (Corvo in the main story, Daud in the DLC) wields a sword in his right hand, and an arsenal of weapons and supernatural powers in the left. Swordplay is very tight, surpassing that of games like Chivalry and Skyrim, in my opinion. (Of course, that's in MY opinion.) It's very streamlined with a dedicated attack button and a block button, and it's all about timing parries and knowing when and where to strike.\n\nAs for the other hand, you gain, early on in the story, the Blink power, which allows instantaneous teleportation across short distances. On top of that, you can unlock further powers, like Posession (which allows you to possess rats and animals, and can be upgraded to possess people), Bend Time (slows down time Matrix-style, and full-on stops it when upgraded), and a ton more. On top of that, you have a few subweapons like an upgradable pistol and a crossbow that fires different kinds of darts like steel darts, tranquilizers, and explosive/incendiary darts. You also get a few other cool stuff like razor traps and grenades.\n\nNow, with all these options you can clearly see why there's a number of ways to approach your target. There's a ton of combinations you can use against enemies. Freeze time, shoot a few rounds at multiple guards, and watch as they all go flying at once. How about possessing a guard and making him walk in front of his buddy's bullet? While this is technically a stealth game... I mean, c'mon, you have all these toys? Why not wreak a little havoc? Slice and dice and shoot down everything in sight. Or maybe you're like me, where you prefer not to be seen? Good news for you, you can literally go through the entire game (both the main mission and the DLC), and I stress this, THE ENTIRE GAME, without either killing a single person or being seen or detected once. Good. God.\n\nNow, while it seems like I have nothing but endless praise for this game, for the sake of not sounding like a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shill, I do have to say this game had a few flaws.\n\nFor one thing, it CAN get a little dull once you've played it enough. The replayability is endless but sometimes you'll find yourself using the same strategies each time. Blink is outright broken and there's even an achievement for not buying/upgrading ANY powers and just using Lv. 1 Blink. And the sad thing is, if you know what you're doing... It's not hard.\n\nSecondly, the music is really highly forgettable, and the only good song in the game is the closing track, "Honor For All". The sound direction is okay at best, and really you only use it to avoid being detected by listening for sounds.\n\nAnd the story is really kind of dull. The characterization is abysmal and the writing is predictable and cliche. Now I say this, but the Daud DLC really improves on both writing and characterization, so it's not as big a problem with that... Just don't expect anything much playing the main story.\n\nAnother thing I saw this game catch flak for (I didn't mind it so much myself, but it is a legitimate grievance) is that the game punishes you for going high chaos. IE being detected often, killing too many people (threshold is about 30% of npcs per mission). You will get the bad endings. On the upside though, if you prefer this playstyle and don't mind the endings, it does sort of reward you by making areas more highly populated by guards and other enemies. If you like to kill a lot, you get more to kill. You'll just get the bad ending in the process. You'll definitely want to try both playstyles.\n\nNow, those complaints aside, I still HIGHLY recommend this game for literally everyone. Even if you're a casual gamer, or an RPG fan, or an FPS fan, or hell, even an RTS fan, just give it a go once. There's a very good chance you won't regret it. It's really a fantastic title.","May 14, 2015","true","62.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

In short, Dishonored gives gameplay choice with style.\n\nI am a fan of both Deus Ex and Bioshock, however dislike Thief a lot. When I first started playing Dishonored, I was hesitant to play it due to it's familiarity to Thief. Nevertheless, Dishonored didn't give me some boring experience I haven't tried yet. Ground breaking, not quite. Different? Definitely.\n\nYou start out as the main character Corvo who is framed for killing an empress and for kidnapping her daughter. The character gets convicted then thrown into jail. There is an underground revolution at work nonetheless and manage to break Corvo out. It's the revolutionaries versus the order, with some random mix of weirdos in between (zombie like people who will bite you in the lower levels of the streets or sewers).\n\nThe game play is inclusive in inviting Bioshock's special abilities (like teleporting or summoning a heard of rats to attack someone) and mimics it's ability to pick up items/ammo. This I'm not a big fan of as you'll have to point specifically to the item and press X. Ideally, pressing X should just pick up everything. Moving on; the game follows Deus Ex in a sense where you can pick up a few objects to cause distractions (throwing bottles and the sort). Stealth seems similar to DE, but the indicators that are given in-game to notify the player of the enemies awareness level is fantastic. The meter can fill up pretty quick, but none the less is an appreciated addition to the game. The stealth seems fairly accurate when moving around, and getting caught can suck as enemies won't be afraid to flank you from behind. When playing, the player can choose to wield a gun and a sword, or a special power and a sword. Don't expect to get loads of ammo to blow everyone's head off as choosing when to use it can get you out of tight scenarios. There are variances such as crossbows in lieu of a gun. The sword is a neat feature and plays a vital role in sneaking up behind opponents to deliver their execution. Additionally, you could choose to choke them out rather than killing them. Either way, the player grabs the body and there is a chance to press x to quick carry. You are also able to block with sword with RB, and when timed right, the player can do a quick counter attack. Taking massive amounts of enemies head on is not recommended in this game as it can lead to death very quickly. Dodging and blocking at this point becomes funny as swords begin to fly from every which angle. Another neat feature (which sort of showed the Wolfenstein part of this game) is when you press Y to lean, you can lean left and right to peek around corners. I have to mention jumping from platform to platform (or even climbing them) is extremely smooth and forgiving. This is probably one of the best features of the game; you can use your special instant teleport power to get to a higher ground, but even if you come short, you can teleport and then by holding forward you can still climb up. Quite neat if you ask me and an excellent feature of the game!\n\nVisuals are comparable to Bioshock art style. Some of the views are awesome and the characters designs and dynamic. The dialogue can be slow for some but can be worth the listen to others. Sounds are all appropriate and the sound of the blunderbuss going boom is nice.\n\nThe saving scheme is awesome. Auto save is featured as well as the ability to save at your disposal (not when in trouble though).\n\nOverall, the game delivers an enjoyable single player experience. If there was a local co-op feature or even multiplayer I'm sure there would have been a lot of added re playability here. I would recommend this game to people who look for single player games that give a bit of a challenge, or to Bioshock fans. I like this game, but not to the point of drooling over it. It's a good game, I'll give it that. What I would like to see in a sequel (maybe), is more control over the sword. Have the player press LT then swing with the joystick or the sort, so it doesn't feel like I'm simply pressing a button.\n\nRating : 7.8/10\n\nI'm on the fence for buying it full price, on a sale price if you like single player games, I would say go nuts.\n\nScreenShots :\nThe movement system tries to incorporate all basic locomotion including jumps\n\nCarrying corpses is relatively easy in the game\n\nObjects can be thrown at people or as distractions. You cannot pick up anything in abundance such as Deux Ex\n\nStats are also shown at the end of each level\n\nNeat gimmicks such as climbing down a chain, add a bit more fun to what you can do\n\nIn-game scenery visual","May 12, 2015","true","6.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

When people get eaten by rats or killed by you they are marked as dead and increases chaos. Which will in turn make guards more alert and make it harder to stealth future segments. It also affects the population more and more as you go through the game.\n\nStealth\nThe stealth is pretty good but what makes it great is the abilities that help you out. Being able to quickly move up and down floors so you can get into a good position to stalk guards to either knock out or kill is fun. Though usually you have to make sure that you do it in a way that allows you time to prevent his friends from seeing him knocked out or his body just resting there.\n\nSkills\nWell there is two types of skills really, nonlethal and lethal. If you are trying to avoid killing there is some skills you will not even want to bother to invest in at all. This could have been structured a bit clearer for people new to the game so that they can select skills that are proper for their playthroughs.","June 15, 2014","true","133.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Have the player press LT then swing with the joystick or the sort, so it doesn't feel like I'm simply pressing a button.\n\nRating : 7.8/10\n\nI'm on the fence for buying it full price, on a sale price if you like single player games, I would say go nuts.\n\nScreenShots :\nThe movement system tries to incorporate all basic locomotion including jumps\n\nCarrying corpses is relatively easy in the game\n\nObjects can be thrown at people or as distractions. You cannot pick up anything in abundance such as Deux Ex\n\nStats are also shown at the end of each level\n\nNeat gimmicks such as climbing down a chain, add a bit more fun to what you can do\n\nIn-game scenery visual","May 12, 2015","true","6.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Bunun en büyük nedeni 1 saat 2 saat oynayıpta inceleme yazmayı sevmiyorum. Kısa bir oyunsa bitirdikten sonra yazmayı tercih ediyorum. Yok değilse en azından inceleme yazacak kadar oynama taraftarıyım. Bazen görüyorum; adam yardırmış, giydiriyor oyuna. Oynama süresine bakıyorum; 15-20 dk, oyunun vaadettiği süreye bakıyorum 50 saat 60 saat hatta bazen 100 saat. Ben bu incelemenin nesini dikkate alayım. Destan yazın demiyorum ama 50 saatlik senaryousu olan oyuna da 15 dk oynayıp inceleme yazmayın. Gerçekten komik oluyor.\n\nİçimi döktükten sonra gelelim incelemeye. Eski pc min über berbatlığı yüzünden bir türlü oynayamadığım oyunlardan biriydi Dishonored. Düşünün şu anki pc imle 100 küsür fpslerde oynadığım Dishonored eski pc imde medium da 30 fps yi zor görüyordu. Optimizasyonun ne kadar mükemmel olduğunu burdan da anlayabilirsiniz ve tabi eski pc min über berbatlığını :) Kısmet bugünlereymiş. Neyse güç olsun da güç olmasın diyerekten devam edeyim.\n\nEn sonda söyleyeyim; oyun çok çok güzel. Özellikle oynanış kısmı mükemmel. Hele bir de gamepadiniz varsa alacağınız keyif 3-5 e katlanıyor.  Dishonored size inanılmaz bir serbestlik sunuyor. Gizlilik/aksiyon türünde bir oyun olmasına rağmen sizi hiçbir şeye zorlamıyor. "İlla bu yoldan gideceksiniz" diye bişey yok oyunda. Tamamen size kalmış. İster milleti doğraya doğraya gidin. İster hiçkimseyi öldürmeyin, isterseniz hiç farkedilmeden ilerleyin. Tamamen size kalmış.\n\nGrafiklere gelecek olursak çok iyi diyemem ama çokta kötü değil oyunun temasına uygun olmuş. Açıkçası gerçekçi grafikler yakışmazmış bu oyuna. Oynadıkça onu farkettim. Zaten bi yerden sonra grafik umrunuzda olmuyor ki bu çoğu oyun için geçerli. Oyun kaliteliyse bir şekilde oynatıyor kendini.\n\nDishonored bir intikam hikayesi. Bi görev dönüşünde kraliçe öldürülür ve kızı kaçırılır. Suç bizim üzerimize kalır ve hapse gireriz. İdamımızı beklerken bir şekilde hapisten kaçmayı başarır ve kraliçenin kızını aramaya koyuluruz. Bir yandan da adımızı temize çıkarmak için uğraşırız. Biraz klişe bir hikaye ama ucu açık bitiyor Dishonored 2 nin duyurulduğundan hiç haberiniz bile olmasa oyunu bitirdikten sonra "bunun mutlaka devamı gelir" diyorsunuz.\n\nUzun lafın kısası; hala bugüne kadar oynamadıysanız ilk fırsatta mutlaka satın alın ve oynayın. Parasını sonuna kadar hak eden bir yapım olmuş. Ben oyunu yüksek kaos ta bitirdim. Gerçi son 5 bölümün 4 ünde öldürdüğüm insan sayısı 10 bile değildi ama başlarda katliam yaptım resmen ondan sanırım. Ama siz mümkün olduğunca gizli ilerlemeye çalışın böylece hem itemlerinizi fazla harcamak zorunda kalmazsınız hem de mermi/ok sıkıntısı çekmezsiniz. Ayrıca araştırmacı olun.

Yet at the same time this game is absolutely gorgeous, from its aesthetic design to its soundtrack.\n\nDishonored is absolutely rich with detail, from the technology powering the city of Dunwall to the strange world the Outsider draws you into, and the powers he grants you. A lot of love was put into building this world, and it really pays off to explore the locations you are sent to – in the literal sense as well as the figurative, for there are many bonus rewards (Runes, Whale bone charms, etc) hidden throughout each area. Hell, even eavesdropping on the NPCS and enemies has its benefits, for the characters' dialogue will change depending on your actions and how Chaotic Dunwall is because of said actions. Plus it's a handy way to learn secrets and additional information about your current objectives.\n\nEvery time I start this game over I find myself taking different routes towards my targets; from the tiny rat tunnels to the rooftops, there's always some new, alternate way to get to the sorry ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you've been assigned to kill, plus there are a dozen different ways to kill said targets. Assassinating is cinematic and satisfying, and the animations fluid. However the more enemies there are the harder it gets to fight back, so it really is better to avoid large scale confrontations. Unless of course you have the very expensive yet extremely useful Lvl 2 Time Warp ability. Then it's a walk in the park.\n\nI could seriously sing praise to this game for paragraphs, but I will keep this review short.\n\nAlthough I have been told it is not the absolute best stealth game on the market, it is my favourite one to date. 10/10!\n\nP.S: StealthGamerBR's Dishonored videos are insane.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/708817/recommended/205100/","708817","Standin.Sittin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/708817/","31 products in account","Introduction\nWant a game that makes you feel immersed by its colorful and peaceful atmosphere? A game where you could explore the world to its unimaginable limits? Last but not least, a game that is immensely moddable? Well, this game is not for you!\n\nDishonored is an underdog game developed by Arkane Studios that brings you to a new universe filled with government corruption, discrimination towards the lower-middle class, and rat plague.\n\nYou'll be able to play as the disgraced lord protector, Corvo Attano, who seeks revenge towards those who... 'dishonored' him... -along with the Outsider's powers that apparently requires you a lot of mana potions for you to do some rad killstreaks. That unless you want a stealthy approach, then prepare to load your game every single moment the enemy spots you for ridiculous reasons.\n\nIf you have the DLCs, The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches, you'd also be playing as the master assassin, Daud, who journeys through Dunwall discovering the mystery of a powerful Witch who deems to rule the city (and soon the world). His goal is to stop her evil plan to justify the guilt trip that he had after what he did.\n\nReview\nThe game is close enough to being a masterpiece if not because of the difficulty it lacks (there's a mod for that apparently), the strange bugs that haven't been fixed after 2-3 years, and the nerve wracking plot. However, it was still able to live up as one of the greatest games that came out as a first title to a new franchise. It gave us a fresh feeling to a new game by giving us a powerful yet stealthy assassin that has a mix of first-person combat and cheap parkour. It has some sort of semi-rpg aspects put into it since there are sub-quests scattered all around the area during your mission and there are choices you make that slightly affects the environment of the next mission and the game's ending.\n\nTHE PROS\n\nAs you dwell into the plot, you'd think that the whole story would be cliched. You are right. However, it won't be a linear one. The game gives you a choice or rather an opportunity that would affect the last chapter of the game. In fact, the main story is more dynamic than an Elder Scrolls game but less dynamic than a Fallout game. The books that you probably wouldn't read includes the game's lore of the city and outside of it and some journals that once you look at the corpse who wrote it, you'd feel bad for him/her. Seriously, those rotting couples who died while hugging each other and being surrounded by plague rats, and an enemy guard that has an infected friend who wanted to euthanize him; these started to hit me right in the feels after reading their last words written on a letter... It shows how cruel the plague has lead to the people of Dunwall.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, the developers were somehow able to make the game pass through that awful area that we call: repetitiveness. As mentioned a while ago, the game gives us varied ways to go through the objective. On each mission, there are sewers, open hallways, alleys, or hidden passage ways for you to decide whether you go rampage mode or go Thief style sneaking through every living obstacle. Even though the upgrades were only few, upgrading one skill already delivers an impact to the gameplay.\n\nOther than that, the graphics are the ones that surprised me out of all the stuffs I've experienced in this game. The developers have learned that even mere textures and right lighting could make a visually compelling atmosphere without having high-poly models and applying the frame killing Ambient Occlusions. An eye trick as what it seems. What more if you add a graphic enhancer mod to it.\n\nThe audio gave a decent feel into the game's surroundings. The soundtracks were so emotional that it immersed me throughout my playthrough. They made a way to make the ambience feel lively even if the area wasn't crowded. Overall, it's decent.\n\nTHE CONS\n\nHere's the part where it gets slightly bad. On the plot of the main story, the part where your 'allies' tell the things you do for the mission doesn't make sense for me since they themselves never tend to help you at all! Captain: "Corvo, kill this man in order to cripple the main boss! Now if you'll excuse me, the other loyalists and I will just stay here in the pub and intensify our tea-sipping as you kill 50 men on your way." The DLC story although fixed that by giving you the power to summon your allies and fight with you, but the main story of the game apparently never had such.\n\nGoing back to gameplay, there are cases in the game where it starts to glitch out such as when you have to bring an unconscious body to someone for a non-lethal approach of the mission. Once you go near to the person who told you the objective while bringing the body, it will go to a scene where the conversation starts and your character will drop the unconscious body which somehow lead to his/her death. Thus, your non-lethal objective failed. There are also some cases where you just wanted to hide the body, but as you gently drop them near a movable object, it's possible that when they hit the object, they'll die. It's one of those annoying things if you wanted to achieve something in the game.\n\nEven though the UI settings was well implemented (though, you can't turn off the item selection UI whenever you bind them to your hotkeys), it's hard to say the same thing with the graphics options. Obviously, it lacks options.\n- AA only has 3 options: Off, MLAA, and FXAA\n- There are no Shadow options at all\n- The Rat Shadows doesn't even work even if you toggle it On!\n- Level of Detail options don't exist\nYou may ask why are all of these mentioned when they're practically unnecessary; it's because there's actually an option for that if you look into a/an .ini file! You can even change the density of the particles, turn up the textures that is beyond the in-game texture settings, and increase the intensity of Anti-Aliasing and Anisotropic Filtering! Other than that, there are those very VERY low-res textures even if the textures were set on high. Even a 2000s game could beat this (that would be those Source engine games).\n\nLastly on the audio, the guard dialogues were repetitive that it ended up being funny whenever you hear them; the rest of the characters however were good as it's not overly exaggerated nor dead boring.\n\n\nVerdict\nConcept        Rating                Main Plot        7/10 (+DLCs 9/10)\n+ Dynamic story depending on your actions\n+ (DLC) Plot Twists\n- Main story is predictable and linear\n- A couple of questionable plot holes\n- cliche cliche cliche\nGameplay        8/10 (+DLCs 7.8/10)\n+ Gametime of 1 to 30 hours depending on your style of gameplay\n+ Lots of choices with a different experience on each\n+ Each power upgrade matters\n- A few bugs/glitches\n- (DLC) Daud's Powers are OP!\nGraphics        8/10\n+ Visually stunning environments\n+ Surprisingly smooth FPS while maintaining the current gen graphics\n- Lacks graphic options\n- Some really low-res textures on certain areas\nAudio        8/10\n+ Decent yet immersive soundtracks\n+ Ambience?

I highly encourage you to pick this game up, upon reading this review! It's a great game, and I loved every second of it!\n\nThere really aren't many negative things to say, but I do have a one or two. Let's start with the PROS.\n\nPROS\n\n*Stealth- You can play this game with out much confrontation. Sneak around, sparing the lives of your enemies. (The more blood you  shed, the darker the game's outcomes will be in multiple ways.) Their are many ways to silently, and humanely dispose of your foes, with out shedding too much bodily fluid, but at the same time, you can slit their throats, and leave them choking on their own blood, or send crossbolts into their flesh, unknowingly. Maybe if you're feeling the urge to see your enemies scatter in fear, you can rewire, and turn their own defenses against them, witnessing the cool breeze taking their warm, dry ashes with it. Don't feel like a coward if you need to run away. It is a very huge part of the stealth gameplay. The best part, is that you can not only run, but jump, climb, slide your way into the shadows or roof tops, leaving your pursuers to fumble around in the gnarly, Brined Hagfish scented crop dust you left for them to choke on. Their are many ways to "neutralize your enemies, but I'll let you discover that with your prefered play style.\n\n*Close Combat (When you don't care who hears and sees)- You can always go head on and Destroy your enemies, leaving them in their own puddles of blood and ash. Upgrade your sword, and pistol, to mold them into the killing machines they are meant to be. Nothing like striking down your foe, and thrusting cold, sharp steel in between his shoulder blades. Explosive bolts? Yeah, I'm sure you can imagine how many head will be rolling when you get your hands on those babies.\n\n*Engaging Story- I really enjoyed the story, even though it didn't take me long to complete it. There are many ways to play through it, with loads of choices, allowing you to play the story your way. The game has unique characters, and rewarding side mission's that will have you treking in the direction you so chose to go.\n\n*Runes, and Bone Charms- These are basically items that power up your character, and abilities. They give you the ability to make the Corvo that you want.\n\n*Bethesda- (Nuff said)\n\n\nCONS (or things I would've liked better)\n\n*Non-Lethal Melee Attacks- The game definitely has it's ways of dealing with enemies once they spot you. (IE.. Sleep darts, Running away, Killing.. ect.) However, I would've liked to be able to bash an enemy with my sword, rendering him unconsious, rather then gutting him like an animal. I just wish that there were some alterative ways to silencing an agro enemy, without killing them, or wasting precious sleep darts. (and they are precious!) There are just those times, when running away may not be an option, and if you don't want to compromise your belief that all life is precious, then that means re-loading a last save. The only alternative, is to be more sneaky, and plan out your takedowns. I'd say it's a way of making the game more challenging, but I think combat was that already, especially when surrounded by multiple enemies, shooting, and stabbing you.\n\n\nLike I said, not many cons. That's the only one that I had, and it wasn't really a con. More of a reference, really. Anyways, pick up the game and try it out, before #2 comes out! It's going to be awesome, and I hope it lives up to all the hype! Well, Happy slashing!\n\nSincerely, Deathtoll.

I was a little disappointed that I was only told that the number of people I killed influenced the state of the story and city after a couple of levels where I had already killed a number of people.  After that I Primarily used nonlethal takedowns.  Even for characters who were targets of a mission, I chose the stealthy and sneaky way to kill as few people as possible,  but everybody still reveared me as a mass murderer, so for the last few levels I just said screw it and killed everybody.  Stealthing is pretty fun, but the combat mechanics feel kind of clunky.  Perhaps they meant for it to be this way to encourage you to be sneaky.  Although, the problem I found with going full sneaky-beaky is that there would be a lot of weapons and powers that you would never be able to use since they are loud and explody and cause your enemies to be eaten by a swarm of rats as they scream in agony.  So either way It feels like you can't get the whole experience of the game in just one playthrough.  That was my main issue.

Dishonored is heavily based on stealthy approach to complete the missions and you'll be given a lot of choices to determine the outcome of your current mission's story, the other character's dialogue and behavior, plus the ending.  Like BioShock, you'll have a weapon (unlike BioShock, sword only) on your right hand and multiple tools on your left hand, both controllable individually. The difference is, Dishonored has way less choices of supernatural powers and weapons. The combat only focuses on melee combat even you're given a flintlock-like pistol and a crossbow as a ranged weapon.\nHere's the goods and the bads of the game:\n\nPros:\n+ Another beautifully written story for a video game\n+ Challenging combat. you are not extremely OP like in most other games, but also not awkwardly animated like Chivalry: Medieval Warfare's sword fight\n+ Your actions and decisions will decide the outcome of the story\n+ Supernatural powers, even though it's very limited (new powers for the DLC campaign) but it's still very fun to use. Just like BioShock, you hold the magic power on your left hand while your right hand will hold a weapon (in this case, sword only)\n+ A lot of choices to complete your missions. Different approaches are available each with their own consequences and benefits.\n+ DLC is also pretty good, telling a story that's happening on the other side with a character that will eventually meet your main character on the main story. If you like challenges, one of the DLC offers a complete set of challenges that will test your in-game combat, stealth, and agility skill.\n+ Enemy types varies just like Assassin's Creed even though the enemies in Dishonored don't have any weaknesses that can be exploited.\n+ Collectibles, hidden objects to power up, hidden rooms, etc. If you love those kind of things, this game's totally for you. Mostly, you'll have to sniff around and explore almost every corner of the map in order to level up your powers properly.\n+ Pretty good graphics, but not great.\n\nCons:\n- Horrible character graphics, they only have very limited models plus lack of details sometimes make it very obvious that a lot of duplicates are walking around.\n- Story outcome solely based on your capability to stealth. A stealthy and merciful playstyle will save the entire kingdom while aggressive and murderous playstyle will throw the kingdom into a deeper pit of chaos since all your actions will be taken example of by the upcoming Empress.\n- Kills are limited on every level (around 15 each mission if you want a good outcome) which makes this game pretty weird. An assassin who is not allowed to kill anyone, seriously? You must use non-lethal weapons if your stealth fails and stuck in inescapable conflict.\n- I'm no fan of finding hidden objects which are usually very far and way too tedious to find it and I'm sure I'm not the only one. Lack of power upgrades will make stealth much harder.\n- Some maps are confusing, especially the Brigmore house in the DLC\n- Sword range is weird, the animation won't show the sword reaches you but you will still get hit. Sword blocks sometime fail to work during this time.\n\nTL;DR If you like BioShock, you'll like this game. It's almost the same thing, just much more limited weaponry and choices. But if you hate stealth games, don't buy this game. It is solely based on stealth, nothing more.\n","January 8","true","15.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","4"

It's about revenge; armed with deadly weapons and supernatural powers, you seek vengeance upon all of those who orchestrated your downfall. It's about a city; the plague-ridden industrial port of Dunwall is lovely to behold, exciting to explore, and seething with secrets. It´s about rescueing a little girl the daughter of the murdered Queen.\nThe Story is very exciting and its told in a good way..not too much and not too less. So you are never bored and have to skip videos and you also know always why you do what you do. The incredible variety of ways you can engage or evade your enemies is impressively flexible and utterly captivating. The Graphics are fine. Im using an old 2 Core Computer atm..it runs perfectly smooth on it, so it got very well programmed. I didnt see any Bugs. It has easy controls and also Full Controller Support, both work perfectly fine. I cant say anything negative about this game. If you love Games like Bioshock Infinite or Thief then defenetily buy it. Its in the sales for 3,24 € and its worth minimum 20 € compared to the quality of this game, so im very pleased with it.","June 28, 2014","true","41.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","5"

Highly atmosperic and immersive, it tells an amazing story and puts you in control throughout it's duration.\n\nThe game starts out easy enough but soon after throws you into the lions den. As the title suggests, you are dishonored and stripped of your status and thrown into prison after a certain event transpires. It is here the game makes brilliant use of a stalking/cover mechanic as you are forced to escape your binds. You are able to peek around corners to remain unseen and you always have the option of a non violent approach. Sneak up behind and knock them out or bury your sword into their neck, the choice is yours. When combat is initiated, you have a plethora of options open to you. You hold your sword in your right hand and have the option of equiping crossbows, pistols and powers in your left. Careful timing of your block opens enemies up to counter attack and choose to put an arrow in their skull, blast a musket ball into their chest or finish them with your sword. There are options open to you even if you are in combat, to resolve the situation non violently if you choose. Options include sleep syringes shot from your crossbow or using your powers to disappear into the darkness. But be carefull, killing all in your path has a negative effect and can drastically change each mission and the world as a whole.\n\nSome of the powers at your disposal include a blink ability to quickly teleport and (but not limited to) conjuring a swarm of rats to attack and eat your enemies. There are several other powers but I dont want to spoil the surprise. I will say there are powers to purchase and upgrade that will suit any playstyle. You purchase powers and upgrades by finding runes hidden throughout each level. Some can be bought and others found. There is an item that puts markers on runes and charms when used so you never have to leave any behind. Charms you can collect and find, offer passive bonuses like being able to choke out an enemy faster or that make a power more potent. There are tons of charms to find so the combinations are endless. Up to 6 can be equipped at a time unless you have the DLC which allows you to equip up to 10.\n\nBetween missions, you have a home base to buy equipment and upgrades. Here is where you recieve your next mission and often are given clues about side missions to complete while tackling the main. This is a large area packed with lots of goodies to find and people to talk to.\n\nThe story in Dishonored is stellar. Events always unfold in first person and there are no camera shifts the break immersion. The voice acting cast has stars like Susan Sarandon and Brad Dourif just to name a couple and they do an awesome job of fleshing out their characters.\n\nThere really is no complaint I can level against Dishonored. It is a masterpiece and multiple playthroughs using different tactics never dull the fun. From its beautiful graphics, story, characters, weapons, powers and atmosphere to its high replayability, there really is nothing wrong about the game. Anyone that enjoys first person games with emphasis on stealth and combat, with RPG elements sprinkled in, will enjoy Dishonored.","September 7, 2015","true","28.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","4"

(don't worry you can still killl everyone if that's the sort of thing you're in to.)\nThe game is relatively short but boy is it sweet! btw there are great DLC additions as well wich definitely expand they amount of hours you can put in.\nWhat i really like about Dishonored is that you get FREEDOM in the way you wanna take on the mission, there are alot of different paths you can take and alot of hidden stuff aswell example: secret pathways safe combinations, runes, bone charms, alot of money and all that good stuff.\nIt also has a GREAT skill tree/abilities wich also let's you replay levels and finish them on completely different ways.\nIt has an unique and great art style wich is very beautiful\nDishonored has some great characters in it and often they let you make moral dicisions wich in a way can afflict some missions, + you have some forms of alternate endings depending on a certain way of playing the game.\nIf this wasn't enought to convince you then let me summon up the pros and cons below.\n\nPOSITIVE:\n\n+ cheap even with all the dlc\n+ many different ways to take on a mission\n+ good story\n+nice graphics\n+no bugs no crashes\n+great dlc\n+INSANE replay availability\n\nNEGATIVE\n\n-too short if you "run and gun"\n-setting of the game and art style  might not suit everyone\n\nIn short i HIGHLY reccomend this game to anyone who likes stealth based games.\nI hope my review helped you in to making a decision ^^\nPS: the review might have some grammar mistakes english isn't my native language n.n\n\nOh and yeah uhm.. 11/10 would fight with a posse of rats again\n","November 30, 2014","true","20.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

You can create chaos, or stay completely in the shadows.

The Dunwall City Trials DLC that comes with the Game of the Year edition is worth it if you can get it for $2.50, but it is nothing like The Knife of Dunwall or the Witches of Brigmore, two DLC single-player campaigns that are shorter but are just as high quality as the main game.

You don't have to to precise jumping and quickloading five times because you missed that effin platform or balcony. If you can reach that platform, a symbol in the lower HUD will tell you and you just have to press the jump-button and done.\n- Although many reviews state otherwise in their respective opinion, I liked the story. Good old revenge driven killing. What else do you need?\n- Running, jumping and teleporting is pure FUN. Because it works. It's just the problem it's sometimes limited by the map.\n- The combat feels GREAT. Your pistol has a great impact and your enemies fly like kicked by a mule. The swordfight feels very satisfying. I had nothing to complain about here.\n- The steampunkish flair is great and well made.\n\nThe bad thing:\n- This game would be even better if it would be a free roaming game and if you could go visit / go berzerk on a whole city. Instead of this, you have single fragments of a city / map where you are kinda very limited to which way you use. (Direct confrontation and blasting your way through or going stealth.)\n- The enemies have almost no variation. There are soldiers, sometimes dogs, a few assassins sometimes walkers and some civilians. And that's it.\n- It felt kinda short. I played it for a lot of hours (because I dont have any skills) but I think a good gamer will finish this game in a few hours. Atmost.\n- That puking animal/vegetable things are as annoying and useless as the monsters in THIEF 1 are.\n\nConclusion:\nIt's a good game, really, well made, nice graphics, good sounds, a great lore (which can be read in books (which I didn't)) and overall. It just lacks some bigger things, like more enemies, a whole city to explore.","July 12, 2014","true","12.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The streets of Dunwall are like how City 17 might have been if it was in a world where magic and steampunk technology existed, and the threat wasn't from aliens but corrupt officials who stole power after a beloved leader died.\n\nAs Corvo Attano, you get to choose just how you'll seek your revenge; with bloody brutality, subtle killings, or neither. Much like Batman (and in Fallout), you can go through the entire game not killing anyone, and also like Batman, you can still manage to unnerve your opponents by doing so. There's no leveling system, but you do gain a limited amount of runes and money, which lets you customize your character to fit your playstyle. The world is enormous and there's lots of scripted events and passageways which exclude the other, so you will not be able to see everything in one playthrough.\n\nOne of those rare recent games worth buying right now, at full price.

It bests Ocarina of Time, BioShock Infinte, Deus Ex: Human Revolution, etc. This is insanely replayable (on my third run as I write this). This is a game where you have many choices. Lethal or nonlethal, stealthy or guns blazing, different points of entry to buildings, etc. It fits anyone's ideal playstyle, whether that's combat or stealth. Arkane thought of everything with the level layouts. The atmosphere, level design, and setting are excellent. Dunwall may be my favorite video game setting ever. From what I've heard the DLC is even better than the main game. This game also presents a nice challenge, but even on Very Hard (my current run), the game is relatively easy once you get used to it. Dishonored, in my opinion, is one of the best video games ever made, and is in my personal top 5. I would give this game a 10. If I was stuck on a deserted island and I could only have three games with me, this would be my first choice. It's that damn good. I bought it for $4.99 and I feel like I've cheated Arkane here. I would have happily spent 60 at release for this game, and I will whenever a sequel releases. Just scroll up and go buy this game, even at full price.

Mostly it is the decicion: Lethal or not lethal.\nInside the level you are free to go where you want.\n\nYou can play the whole game like DARK, you try to not to be seen, your only target is the mission goal.\nEven if you do so, you can still decide if you kill at all. You WILL be responsible for dead/capture, but you can make it kind of... third parties fault.\n\nThe complete different approach is the killing spree.\nIf you use knife, crossbow, pistol, grenades, mines and magic to the fullest extend you can do incredible cool things.\nYou can freeze time and put a grenade in the hand of someone, take a bullet from the air, teleport behind an enemy to strangle him, send rats to eat your enemies alive or blast them against walls.\nYou can take over a fish or another animal and use different routes, take over a human and walk him out of the sight of others, reprogram towers to kill your enemies and so much more.\n\nSo you can either play the I-do-not-kill-guy with a good ending or the kill-all-enemies-guys with a bad or at least dark ending.\n\nEither way, the game is fantastic.\n\nI really love the graphics, I love the music and the gameplay is very smooth and fun.\n\nThe only thing which is not so good: the character faces are... don't know.. kind of ugly. All of them.\n\nThis game is a must play.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisbuttman/recommended/205100/","thisisbuttman","Buttman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thisisbuttman/","480 products in account","An excellent, albeit not great, FPS game!\n\nIf I had to summarize Dishonored in one sentence, that would be: A stealth-based Bioshock.\n\nTruly the game's mechanics (weapons in one hand, magic in the other, plus a big variety of ways to -or not to- kill the enemies), dark story with enough twists and choise-based multiple endings reminded me a lot of Bioshock, though Dishonored comes as a lot more stealth based than the former (and personally less innovative than Bioshock, in my opinion).\n\nNonetheless, Dishonored is an excellent stealth game, thanks to its magical powers hiding becomes a lot simplified, compared to traditional stealth games like Metal Gear Solid or Splinter Cell and I can say even fun enough. Some magic powers like Blink, Possession and Time Bend, to name a few, were really innovative and cool to use.\n\nThe rest of the weapons (a pistol and a crossbow with various types of ammunition, a variety of grenades or mines, plus your standard sword) provide very brutal kills, for the FPS players wanting action and not stealth.\n\nBasically the game is set so that the choices you make affect the ending and your deeds catch up to you: needlessly killing many characters in the game will result in the so called High Chaos and as so a bad ending, while sparing the lives of most enemies will result in the Low Chaos ending, the good one.\n\nI'll have to admit though that I was expecting more from the main story, based on all the good reviews I had seen of the game, while I found it just ok: it had a few twists, but nothing as shocking as, say again, Bioshock. I'll admit that the story is quite dark though and full of betrayals and brutal killings, should the player decide to go that way.\n\nWhile I usually find myself liking these multiple endings in games, Dishonored and it's achievements are set to make you play the game at the very least twice, so as to see both endings and collect each one's achievements, which, if you add the fact that the game's last two DLCs demand the same treatment, makes the game very time-devouring (took me about two months to get all the endings and achievements, without playing every day of course though).\n\nSpeaking of the games DLCs, there are three in total: the first one, Dunwall City Trials, is, as its name suggests, a set of various challenges and not related to the game's story, while the two latter ones, The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches, show the story from the perspective of another character, the assassin Daud.\n\nAs it happens with many TV series spin-offs, I found myself enjoying the Daud DLCs a lot more than the main story, their duration was shorter and just enough to make you enjoy the game (even with both endings) and the connection they made to the main game made the story a lot more enjoyable. What helped it a lot, in my opinion, was the fact that I found it a lot easier to empathize with Daud, who has the opportunity to make amends for his past deeds and get his redemption, compared to the overall "good-guy" assassin of the main game, Corvo, who is there just to save the day.\n\nThe fact that Daud had a voice actor (Michael Madsen of Kill Bill fame) helped the above fact, while Corvo was, sadly, your usual mute protagonist (meaning that we just don't get to hear him speak, not that he is an actual mute in the game, think of Gordon Freeman for example). Hopefully, in the now announced Dishonored sequel, they will fix this issue and give Corvo a voice actor.\n\nOn the other hand, the Dunwall City Trials is a sadistic DLC, with the challenges's difficulty reminiscent of very hard 8-bit platformer games. I'll even admit that in order to get the final five, or so, achievements and not leave the game incomplete, I had to resort to using a trainer program, with which (before you can even think of accusing me of cheating) let me tell you that I still had trouble in getting said achievements, you can imagine the difficulty (though I'll admit some challenges were a bit fun, when you got the hand of them).\n\nLeaving the story aside, the graphics were also just good, I was expecting a bit more of them from all the positive reception of the game, but at the same time they were not bad. What I personally found bad, was the game's PC optimization, it resulted in a lot of lag and low performance in my side, while the graphics didn't justify such issue. I found out that many AMD graphic card users like myself had similar issues, truly a shame (one of the reasons I had to resort to using a trainer program for the Dunwall City Trials DLC was also related to lag, impossible to play some challenges with it).\n\nThe Soundtrack, again, was just ok, fitting, but nothing too immersive. Maybe it had to do with the game's stealth atmosphere, this is not Doom or Wolfenstein after all, but still...\n\nGameplay-wise though, the game was quite great, the quick-access wheel was very comfortable to quickly find your next weapon and the creativity you had with the "stealth or kill" environment was nice.\n\nOverall, the game was excellent and I'm not trying to say otherwise, but personally the big hype and the frame rate issues were what ruined it a bit for me.\n\nI'll still recommend it for the moral choices it provided, the few plot twists and the variety of ways to engage or avoid enemies. Most of all, I'll repeat it, I recommend it for the two Daud DLCs, which will make you appreciate the main story a lot more.","June 28, 2015","true","156.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

Each mission involves several openly designed zones, where you may freely explore to find upgrades, ammo, coin and optional objectives along the way.\n\nBoth stealth and brute-force playstyles are viable, with a wide array of weaponry and powers at your disposal.  Blink instantly from point to point; possess rats and fish to tunnel your way in, or guards to walk them to a secluded area for disposal; stop time to sneak past a group of enemies or slaughter them all undetected; or just go in guns blazing.\n\nA lot of fun, looks amazing, well-optimized, and has great level design.

Dishonored executes the stealth aspect just like I expected and even exceeded it. Why? You have ♥♥♥♥ing powers. Want to possess a person? Do it. Want to summon a horde of flesh eating rats? Do it. Dishonored gives you a lot of choices too. Go stealth or go kill everyone in sight. Kill the target or spare his/her life? All your choices will affect the story and thus the ending too.\n\nThere is great satisfication when killing your target. Drop killing especially, feels awesome. But why not kill everyone in sight? You can do so without anyone even touching you (but that doesnt mean the game is easy, it isn't). Sound badass right? Yes it is.\n\nThere are dissapointments though. The obvious one, as you may have known already (reading the reviews), the main story is too damn short and predictable. I finished mine in about 9 or so hours, in hard difficulty. The storyline too, for me, is too weak. I don't care about the soon-to-be empress that you are saving. She may die? I don't really care. All I want to do is to kill people.\n\nThe DLCs, though, has a way way better story. Also, you get more badass powers as Daud. Who cares about summoning rats when you can summon a master assassin anytime you like? Also stopping time every few seconds is so damn awesome. Seriously, buy all the dlcs, that is how awesome it is.\n\nIf you, for some reason, decide not to buy the dlcs (buy them!), the base game itself is a memorable experience. A masterpiece. So what are you waiting for? Buy Dishonored. You will be in for a real treat.","July 20, 2014","true","14.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Dishonored is a first-person stealth adventure game that casts you into the role of Corvo Attano, a former bodyguard, now turned supernatural assassin all because the Empress of the city of Dunwall has been murdered and he has been framed for her death.\n\nEverything about Dishonored is fantastic.\n\nPros:\n+Enemy AI reacts to everything the player does, whether they have been seen or not.\n+A wide variety of skills and weaponry makes every playthrough unique - take the silent route focused on stealth, or be ruthless and slaughter everything in sight.\n+The art style and direction is awesome.\n+Actions have consequences, and some of them can be quite significant...\n+Excellent level design. If you can see a door in front of you, you most likely can open it. If you see a rooftop, you can climb to it. The possibilities when it comes to navigating levels are nearly endless!\n+Likeable cast and characters.\n\nCons:\n+Some of the textures look a little outdated when viewed close up, considering how this was released in 2012.\n+A couple of characters exist merely as plot devices.\n\nOverall, Dishonored is a fantastic game if you can overlook what it doesn't do quite right, and maximises what it does do right. The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches DLC only adds to the sheer awesome that is this game, so I highly reccomend those too.","June 2, 2015","true","87.1"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

You play as Corvo an assassin in service of the local empress. After her assassination a dark and gripping story begins. The world is a sort of decaying city where the economy thrives on whale oil and the strange technology is fuelled by the same oil.\n\nThe game is a FPS-style stealth game but you can choose to play more action oriented. However, this is not an action shooter! So no machine guns, rocket launchers, …\n\nYour primary weapon is a sword and secondary a pistol and crossbow (for silent kills). Next to that you have grenades, mines and that’s it. Ammo is limited. You also dispose of several magic (super natural) abilities. By playing the game you will find objects (runes, coins…) to buy new abilities.\n\nWhen you play you can choose different ways to complete the levels. Go stealth mode and try to kill no one or as little as possible or choose to play more action style.\n\nI find the level design impressive, with a nice and original graphic style. The acting is also quite good. It took me 19 hours to complete the game.\n\nI can also confirm that the game runs perfectly on ultra-wide displays in 21/9 aspect ratio. I tested it on a 2560*1080 resolution.\n\nI highly recommend this game!","March 31","true","18.9"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It combines the multiple paths of classic games like Hitman, Deus Ex, and Thief with fantastic stealth and combat systems. You can be a total pacifist if you want, but if you do choose to kill, there are plenty of great ways to do it: stealthy assassinations, epic swordfights, carefully placed traps, crossbows and guns, or even just summon a huge swarm of rats to eat your enemies alive. Levels are huge. There's plenty of gold to find and safes to open. You are rewarded for exploring your environment instead of just focusing on the end goal. The game is quick to learn but hard to master. Easy enough that you won't have any trouble beating the game, but deep and difficult enough that there's always a new challenge offered. The plot isn't terribly great, but it's still pretty good. Enemy design is fantastic. Graphics won't have you gasping in awe, but they get the job done.\n\nThe game's only flaw is that it doesn't really do anything new. There are plenty of games similar to Dishonored. But what it does do, it does really well. It may not be groundbreaking, but it's still a solid game with tons of replayability. Perfect for the gamer who likes to set challenges for themselves, as well as players who found the original Hitman/Thief/Deus Ex games inaccessible.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/recommended/205100/","IWearLeatherShoes","Tundra Scorpion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/IWearLeatherShoes/","185 products in account","Dishonored: A surprising smash-hit by relatively unknown developers at Arkane Studios. This game is easily one of my top ten favorite games of all time.\nDishonored is one of those games whose playstyle is respective to the individual playing it, it can either be a stealth game or an action game depending on your preferences with an ending that changes depending on how you played it.\nThe story I hate to admit isn't entirely grand in it's simplest form, the player takes on the perspective of Corvo Attano, a silent protagonist through which the player can more fully take on the role and suits the game's approach just fine. Corvo was the bodygaurd of the Empress who was falsely framed for her assassination by corrupt members of government, on the eve of his execution Corvo escapes prison with the help of unknown allies and begins his mission to either restore the city of Dunwall to it's former glory, or spiral down a path of bloodlust. Again, how the game is played is completely up to the player.\nGameplay can generally be summed up in two different playstyles, and the mechanics for both action and stealth are well polished and astounding. Action game fans will love Dishonored's dynamic combat systems, with highly reactive sword fighting and blocks that are intense and satisfying all together, this coupled with a combination of offhand weapons, gadgets and supernatural powers can lead to very creative methods of eliminating threats. The stealth mechanics are also well versed, encouraging the player to think logically and scout ahead to learn the best possible routes to your target, also encouraging exploration of this amazingly thought-out and unique setting to uncover hints and clues for your mission.\nThe setting of Dishonored is without a doubt one of the most amazing experiences to date, Dishonored takes place in Dunwall, a fictional city akin to London that is undergoing an industrial revolution, with advancements in steampunk technology and enhancing the quality of life, all would be going well for Dunwall if not for the recent disaster that has struck the populace: An aggressively spreading plague carried by rats is devastating the city and forcing extreme measures of quarantine which encourages brutality and corruption, creating a significant social bar among the uninfected.\nIf you're playing through a with a stealth approach then the enemies wont exactly matter, but for action types the player will find a large spectrum of enemies each offering different challenges that must be hurdled, from the flesh-consuming swarms of rats to the stilt-walking armored soldiers the action keeps a steady pace throughout, without being overly overwhelming (and even then, you're a supernatural-bloody-assassin, you can escape from combat incredibly easily).\nA sour point on the experience with Dishonored is the occasional bug or glitch that may cause some errors with stats and gameplay. Sometimes for no reason, even if you were completely stealthy a guard may start acting like he's spotted you, patrolling around looking for you, and other times a bug may occur where the game will think you've killed someone when you were particularily careful not to kill.\nAs well, an unsettling flaw with the dialogue means that guards will repeat the same 3-4 lines while looking for you, removing a chunk of the immersion and making the enemies feel like single-minded machines.\nFinally, and this will probably be a nut-punch for plenty of you: Dishonored is a very short game, maxing out at 15 levels with DLC. It is not uncommon for a player to plow through the game in less than five hours. However this is offset by the games very high replay factor, including a summary of mission stats at the end of each level which encourages the player to push towards that perfect score.\nStill in the end, Dishonored is without any doubt one of the greatest games I've played, and despite it's short length and strange scripting habits I have spent disproportionate sums of hours in this game. I recommend Dishonored without any hesitation and I praise the developers on this gem of a game.\n\nWhy does Dishonored not have Steam cards yet?","December 5, 2013","true","204.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Being stealthy is much more fun though!\nThere is character skilling but it doesn't go too deep, that's fine by me as the focus is really on the active gameplay.\nControls are fluid, gameplay is diverse, multiple ways to succeed at your task.But the possibilities you have are all predefined by the dev's, there aren't any completely new ways you can discover.\n\nGraphics & Sound: 7/10\nThe Artstyle is nice but there are textures which aren't really beautiful. The proportions of the characters look a bit weird, they have those huge hands and the characters don't really look unique.\nSound is good, music is fine, too.\n\nStory & Atmosphere: 6/10\nYou arrive somewhere don't know anything but you being the empress' bodyguard and BOOM she's dead. You don't know why you have to do things and unfortunately you don't really care, as you stay a character without personality just like everyone else. Could be worse though, you never feel like being completely useless and the story isn't crazy.\nThe Atmosphere in the Game is awesome though! I really think I'm in 18th -19 th century England. They should have done more about the Steampunk part making the different between reality and this bigger, but that's personal preference. There are some books you find all over the places, not too bad, but you can't compare them to TES books.\n\nAfter all, is it fun? (There are good games which for some reason just don't entertain you)\nYes. So let's give it 1 bonus point and finish with an 8/10.","December 6, 2014","true","12.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

It's like a stealth Bioshock Infinite, could match, or even be better than Deus Ex - Human Revolution. Great story, great lore (and I usually just skip through all the books), interesting powers and decisions that actually make difference in darkness of the world you're in.\nThat said, I also must mention some cons. First of all, game is too easy, even on highest difficulty. It felt like there was same number of guards on normal and on very hard, just the amount of damage and their ability to spot you differ. Secondly, during the game you're giving decent amount of weapons and upgrades for them. But the game encourages you to try not to just go running and killing, which prevents you from using those weapons. Furthermore, sleeping darts and mana potions are far less found throughout the world, especially in last 2 missions, so if you didn't buy them before endgame and you run out...tough luck. On contrary, regular bullets, darts and other "high chaos" ammo can be found on any guard that you knock down, randomly on shelves and lockers, which becomes annoying at one point if you're trying to stealth the entire game.\nAlso, if you're trying to go through the complete game without killing anyone, being detected or raising any alarms, be warned. Game has some unusual ways of crediting you with random deaths that happen around you that you did not cause or had anything to do with. But, nevertheless, this was the most challenging thing trying to do, I had so much fun doing it, and there is some strange satisfactory feeling waiting for your results after each chapter and finding out you did it perfectly.\nGame per se is short enough (around 10-15h) so it gives you opportunity to play it again, with other decisions so you can see how exactly dark/light can the world stay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chillpill1/recommended/205100/","chillpill1","Chill Pill","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chillpill1/","338 products in account","The Game: Dishonored is a very fun stealth-based first-person objective-based game; with the option to explore other areas on most maps. You play as Corvo, a man framed for the murder of the Empress. You escape prison with an unknown person’s help and meet them at their bar. After this you begin to do missions for these people; to help destabilize the current and corrupt government.\n\nThere are two ways of doing any of the missions, either in High Chaos mode, in this mode you are not concerned about Stealth at all and engage in combat with anyone (who is marked as an enemy). Keep in mind if you get enough of the enemy onto you, you’ll either need to “Blink” (a magical ability Corvo has) away at a higher level (like on top of a ledge or building) and keep hidden; or you can die (quite quickly) trying to kill them all, since the men without blades will use flintlock pistols to shoot you and the men with blades want to remove your head.\n\nYou can also do missions in Low Chaos mode, which may be a little “harder” and it does take a bit longer and require more patience, however in this mode you do not get detected (you must try not to anyways, otherwise it can go to High Chaos if you’re detected and decide to engage in combat). I honestly recommend playing the game while trying to achieve “Low Chaos” since this mode is the most fun (in my honest opinion).\n\nOther than those few things there is Corvo’s signature blade, which is equipped in your right hand – in Corvo’s left hand you can equip various things from magical abilities (like the previously mentioned “Blink” ability), various types of grenades, and finally, Corvo's crossbow (with various types of darts including ones that only put the enemy to sleep, helping your “Low Chaos” Score as that doesn’t count as a death (they’re only asleep)).\n\nOverall: All-in-all I believe Dishonored is a great game with an amazing story and characters. It surprised me that Arkane Studios (the developers behind Dishonored) were able to pull off such an amazing game, especially since before this game I’d never heard of Arkane Studios in my life. Either way, the game runs very well as it utilizes the Unreal Engine 3, so most PC’s that were made in the past five years (as of 2015) should be able to run this game with no real issues. To be safe, make sure your PC is a 2012-2015 model; this way you can play anything that is out, including the newer more graphical games (W3, GTAV, UE4 Games, etc.) I believe that anyone with either patience or the skill to kill several enemies before disappearing and reappearing to finish them off, then Dishonored is for you!\n\nScore: 4/5 – An amazing game with a very fun and interesting Story and Stealth Mode.","August 6, 2015","true","33.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It was one of the more interesting stealth games when it game out.\n\nThere are some interesting aspects to this game that makes it good. The fact that the same guy who designed City 17 in HL2 made Dunwall (the city in Dishonored). The fact that the whole city runs on whale oil opposed to electricity, therefore all the textures are very water colored and desaturated, this results in an amazing overall aesthetic. The fact that every single character in this game is hideous on purpose.\n\nThe gameplay is good but not amazing. It does a great job in making you feel like you are cheating by using your blink ability and high agility. The levels are quite big and there is a fair amount of exploration (also the loading screens are incredibly fast, so transitioning from an area to another is blinking fast :D).\n\nI wasn't a big fan of the binary good\evil ending, however the journey impressed me. Every single area you find yourself in has it's own personality and is highly memorable.\n\nAnd on top of all that, it allows you to play non lethal, finishing the game without killing a single living thing (except rats, ♥♥♥♥ rats).\n\nIt's a nice stylized experience and I recommend it!","October 12, 2012","true","83.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","3"

The addition of supernatural powers enables different playstyles and the outstanding level design enables a lot of exploration and provides different paths to reaching objectives.\n\nThe chaos mechanic is an interesting one: it makes the game respond to how you act. If you choose a more violent approach (killing lots of enemies) the chaos level in the city will be high and the environment will change accordingly (there will be more enemies and rats), as will the outcome of the story. A less lethal playstyle will have a more positive outcome. This contributes to the game's replay value. Some have criticized this aspect of the game, claiming that going for a non-lethal approach makes the game boring, because there are only two ways of dealing with enemies: knocking them out or using sleep darts. I turned the non-lethal approach into a challenge to completely avoid enemies as much as possible, without knocking them out or alerting them, and see how far I can progress in that manner, which made it an interesting challenge. However, it is true that there are far more ways to deal with enemies in a violent manner.\n\nThe two story DLCs (Knife of Dunwall and Witches of Brigmore) are not continuations of the main story but provide an interesting addition. They have three missions each and introduce a couple of new abilities.\n\nDunwall City Trials DLC is not story-based, instead it comes with 10 different challenges that test the player's skill in stealth, agility, ability to quickly perform assassinations etc. The achievements are pretty difficult to get.\n\nOverall I would strongly recommend the game: it has a great level design and a great story with multiple endings, and it allows the player to approach it as a stealth game or as a more action-oriented game.","May 3, 2014","true","88.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It's like a stealth Bioshock Infinite, could match, or even be better than Deus Ex - Human Revolution. Great story, great lore (and I usually just skip through all the books), interesting powers and decisions that actually make difference in darkness of the world you're in.\nThat said, I also must mention some cons. First of all, game is too easy, even on highest difficulty. It felt like there was same number of guards on normal and on very hard, just the amount of damage and their ability to spot you differ. Secondly, during the game you're giving decent amount of weapons and upgrades for them. But the game encourages you to try not to just go running and killing, which prevents you from using those weapons. Furthermore, sleeping darts and mana potions are far less found throughout the world, especially in last 2 missions, so if you didn't buy them before endgame and you run out...tough luck. On contrary, regular bullets, darts and other "high chaos" ammo can be found on any guard that you knock down, randomly on shelves and lockers, which becomes annoying at one point if you're trying to stealth the entire game.\nAlso, if you're trying to go through the complete game without killing anyone, being detected or raising any alarms, be warned. Game has some unusual ways of crediting you with random deaths that happen around you that you did not cause or had anything to do with. But, nevertheless, this was the most challenging thing trying to do, I had so much fun doing it, and there is some strange satisfactory feeling waiting for your results after each chapter and finding out you did it perfectly.\nGame per se is short enough (around 10-15h) so it gives you opportunity to play it again, with other decisions so you can see how exactly dark/light can the world stay. Just...save a lot, have patience and have fun, this game definitely deserves high praises.","October 2, 2015","true","50.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It is great that you can do it in so many ways and that it also  affects the story , For example: I took away a bottle whilst someone was painting another person, when I later found the painting I noticed that the bottle was not in the painting anymore. Eventhough in my first playthrough I killed almost everybody in the city (because it is the most obvious way to dispose of an enemy) I had more fun playing it through for the second time and trying not to get detected. Another great feature is that you can get information on how to complete a challenge and a sidequest by just listening to plain conversations between citizens and guards. Last but not least I adored how there are 3 different endings, for some reason I really felt that I played the game better when I actually had the best outcome.\n\nConclusion: It is an amazing game and I would definetly recommend buying it if you like using amazing powers to sneak past or assassinate people. You can choose very distinct playstyles and therefore it feels like you are more involved in the story.\n9/10","November 17, 2014","true","16.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/recommended/205100/","widgetguy","widgetguy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/widgetguy/","972 products in account","I originally thought that Dishonored was an open world RPG similar to Skyrim or Fallout, but it turns out that it’s actually closer to Deus Ex Human Revolution (action/stealth). Since I only had the free weekend to finish the game I didn’t try to go for all the achievements that I normally would. However, the game lets you know right from the start that the fewer people you kill, the better the outcome will be. That means no hacking and slashing like I was planning to.\n\nIn the game you play Corvo, the chief bodyguard of the empress. When the empress is killed and her daughter kidnapped, you get framed for the crime and sentenced to death. Your main goal in the game is to rescue the daughter and bring the actual murderers to justice.  Since the bad guys are high up in the government, this means you’ll mostly be fighting government soldiers and religious zealots. You’re not alone in your quest since a magical being called the Outsider gives you powers that you can use to complete your objectives. The game does a lot of its background storytelling through notes and books that you run across all over the place. The Dishonored world seems to be roughly 1800’s technology with magic thrown in, resulting in a steampunk environment. The graphics are very similar to the Bioshock games (including that annoying blur effect when you walk through falling water).\n\nAs I alluded to earlier, Dishonored is not really an RPG. You don’t gain experience or level up. There’s no big reason to kill or knock out enemies if you can just sneak around them (unless you want them out of the way for exploration). Your magic powers are upgraded by finding “runes” throughout the game world. Each rune acts like a skill point that you can use to gain or improve your magic powers. The main power you’ll be using is Blink, which is a short range teleport, which is great for getting around and avoiding enemies. The magic powers are generally not “offensive” meaning you’re not throwing fireballs or shooting lighting. Generally they’re for supporting your stealth (see through walls, killed enemies disintegrate, turn into a rat). Almost all your objectives have multiple solutions. You can run through fighting (not recommended) or find various hidden paths like climbing roofs or going through small tunnels. Similar to Deus Ex, when you sneak up on an enemy you can choose a non-lethal takedown or assassinate. Then you need to hide the body since enemies will raise alarm if they find dead or unconscious buddies lying out in the open. There is also a combat system which includes guns and the sword (you can block enemy sword swings). Since I played stealth, I didn’t engage in very much combat. And since I didn’t do a lot of fighting, my ammunition filled up really fast. You can hold a small number of healing/mana potions and arrows/bullets for your weapons.\n\nOverall Dishonored is great and well worth your time. However I wouldn’t say it’s “must play” like some others (Bioshock Infinite, Tomb Raider 2013, etc.). If you’re not into stealth games you will probably get annoyed at times when the enemy random patrols just don’t give you a chance to sneak past. I’ve read online that some people thought the game’s story was weak. It’s not amazing but not bad either. The story mostly just drives the gameplay and tells you where to go. I managed to finish the game during the free weekend a few days ago and it took roughly 16 hours, probably because I was going for no-kills and no-detection. Failed both by the way :(\n","August 25, 2014","true","15.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfrevo/recommended/205100/","wolfrevo","Wolf Revo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wolfrevo/","346 products in account","Here are the essentials that you should know about the game: It is a first-person stealth action game set in a steampunk industrial city infested with a plague (except that everything runs on whale oil instead of steam. The city inherits the city-on-a-coast that is slowly falling apart while a ruling class harasses the citizens vibe from City 17 (Half-Life 2) mixed with the steady unveiling of stories and details through books and audio recordings from Rapture (Bioshock). So the setting is already off to a good start, as I enjoyed both of those games immensely.\n\nAs was revealed to us before the game came out, you play as Corvo Attano, the Empress' body guard. In the first scene the empress is assassinated, her daughter is kidnapped, and you are framed for it. Not the most original plot, I know, but you really do get caught up in it. Before they can execute you of course you escape with the help of a group loyal to the true heir and the rest of the game is the story of your revenge.\n\nOf course, the way that you go about exacting your revenge is entirely up to you. It is entirely possible for you to go in guns blazing and murder everyone in your path; it is also possible for you to kill almost no one throughout the whole game. You can even deal with most of the main targets in a nonlethal manner. The way you play affects several things in the game: the more people you kill, the more rats and plague victims there will be, and the ending of the game will be darker. This concept of giving you a moral choice within a linear framework reminds me once again of Bioshock.\nI opted to try to kill as few people as I could, partly because it is a refreshing change of pace from most video games, and partly because I knew that the guards that I was encountering didn't know the truth and were just following orders.\n\nCorvo has some pretty nifty gadgets at his disposal, including a folding blade, a crossbow, a pistol, rewiring tools, razor mines, and grenades. Oh, and of course his mask.\n\nThe guards in this game aren't completely clueless, so sneaking around them undetected is actually pretty challenging until you start getting awesome supernatural powers from The Outsider. This guy lives in The Void, which is the otherworldly realm where everything magical comes from. He apparently seeks out interesting people to give powers to in order to see what they will do with their powers.  He kind of reminds me of the G-Man (Half-Life) but he manages to be creepy in a whole different way.\nThe powers he gives you include things like short-range teleportation, seeing things through walls, stopping time, possessing animals, and creating a giant swarm of rats that will devour people.\n\nBoth your gear and powers are upgradeable; for gear you collect money and supplies during your missions and bring them back to Piero to have him give you new goodies; for powers you collect whale bone runes and you can select a power to acquire as soon as you have enough runes.\n\nBeing that you are the Empress' body guard and her daughter was abducted, one of your main goals is to ensure Emily's safety. I am noticing that this is a rapidly emerging theme in video games: The Walking Dead, Dishonored, Bioshock Infinite, and The Last of Us all have grown men as the player character with a young girl they must protect.\n\nThere are a few things that I have to complain about, but they are relatively minor notes:\nThe game isn't quite as long as I was expecting. I was almost expecting another plot twist that would keep the game going, but it really was the end.\nIt isn't the most graphically impressive game I've seen. It makes up for it with a unique art style.\n"Player choice" and "many routes to your goal" doesn't mean open world.\n$60 seems like too much. $40 would be a much more reasonable price.","October 23, 2012","true","30.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The time you spent in Dunwall fighting for the future of the empire and her empress will stick with you, long after the game is complete. This city has personality and flavour - it feels like a place, not a set of repeating assets.\n\nYou can take three paths in dishonoured. After your downfall you can remain a righteous fellow, trying to stick to your principles, or you can turn into a crazed maniac, wrecking vengeance on all who stand between you and your goal or you can tread the muddly ground inbetween. Whichever route your nature takes you, the city reflects your heart and so do some of the people closest to you - heartbreakingly, in some circumstances.\n\nThe stealth, magic and combat mechanisms in Dishonoured are a joy to play with once you get comfortable with the controls. I've dabbled heavily in all three (particularly in the Dunwall City Trials DLC) and found them all to a pleasure to work with. This is quite rare - usually in stealth games the combat is a nightmare, or in combat games the stealth is a series of awkward wall-hugging moves - none of that here. The magic is straightforward, but if you don't like magic, that's okay - there's an achievement for you too, going through the game with no magical upgrades at all.\n\nDishonoured is a love letter to the original Thief as well as being a great game in its own right. If you enjoyed Thief: The Dark Project, you'll probably enjoy this. It's easy to imagine Dunwall lying across the sea from Garrett's city - minus the burricks.","March 11, 2014","true","94.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The game gives you a variety of tools to accomplish your goals. You can teleport short distances, possess other NPC's or small animals, summon a group of man eating rats, slow or stop time, etc. In terms of weapons you have a crossbow with various ammo types such as sleeping and incendianary darts, grenades, traps, a pistol, and more. The levels are expertly crafted and offer multiple paths and enough mass to make use of your weapons and powers.\n\nYour choices do have consequences so you need to be aware of that. My original intention was to play through the entire game without killing a soul but that changed later on in the game.  I went after a character that had nothing to do with the mission itself. I wanted that character dead because I overheard what they do for a living and it made me angry so I went out of my way to hunt them down. That piece of gameplay was one of the standout moments for me because of how unexpected it was and the attachment it made me feel towards the game world.\n\nThere are 4 difficulty modes; Easy, Normal, Hard, and Very Hard. If you want a challenge I recommend playing on one of the latter two difficulties. The AI can be very stupid under Normal  and it took away from the immersion and challenge. You are allowed to change the difficulty mid game so if you feel it's too easy or too hard you don't have to start over.\n\nI enjoyed my time with Dishonored and will be giving it another playthrough switching up my tactics and making different moral choices. I was engaged from start to finish and not once did I feel the need to just rush through it and get it over with. Its length was perfect and the entire game feels consistent and very well made.","March 17, 2014","true","29.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

My original intention was to play through the entire game without killing a soul but that changed later on in the game.  I went after a character that had nothing to do with the mission itself. I wanted that character dead because I overheard what they do for a living and it made me angry so I went out of my way to hunt them down. That piece of gameplay was one of the standout moments for me because of how unexpected it was and the attachment it made me feel towards the game world.\n\nThere are 4 difficulty modes; Easy, Normal, Hard, and Very Hard. If you want a challenge I recommend playing on one of the latter two difficulties. The AI can be very stupid under Normal  and it took away from the immersion and challenge. You are allowed to change the difficulty mid game so if you feel it's too easy or too hard you don't have to start over.\n\nI enjoyed my time with Dishonored and will be giving it another playthrough switching up my tactics and making different moral choices. I was engaged from start to finish and not once did I feel the need to just rush through it and get it over with. Its length was perfect and the entire game feels consistent and very well made.","March 17, 2014","true","29.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

Corvo is a bodyguard and is protecting the empress of the city dunwall. but when Corvo comes to see the empress at the very beginning of the game, the empress gets killed by assassin's and corvo is the one they blame for the murder.\nThen some bad people take control over dunwall and you need to make things right.\nThe characters are also good but nothing that special.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Dishonred focuses mostly on stealth gameplay. with every mission you need to kill or neutralize a target so the good people regain something. The good thing about the gameplay of dishonored is that you can complete the missions in so many different ways. You can fire a sleepdart to make your target go to sleep for an example. or you can slice him into bits with your sword, or you can avoid all enemies and only neutralize the target. These are one of the many ways you can complete your mission. if your looking for a game with good stealth gameplay then dishonored will not disappoint.\n\nTHE ENVIRONMENT: When you look at the graphics of dishonored you might think that the graphics are bad,\nbut thats not the case. When i walk around in the world of dishonored i feel like im playing in a painting.\nThis gives the game a really good and unique feel. The world also feels like there is really something going on.\ndishonored's world feels alive and is really nice to look at.\n\nCONCLUSION:  Dishonored gives you fun missions that you can complete in all kinds of ways. combine this with a good story and great gameplay and you get a really good stealth game. The missions also have a ton of replay value, so you might want to play this game for a long time if you want to get the most out of it.\nIf your looking for a game with good stealth gameplay and a nice world for you to discover then dishonored might be the game your looking for.\n","December 27, 2013","true","28.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

For instance, I went through on a completely non-lethal playthrough and found it to be a slow-paced, often difficult, yet immensely satisfying experience... then went on a lethal playthrough and found it to be a short, easy, wisp of a game. Suffice to say the stealth mechanics usually work well, and the game gives you many, many ways to complete various objectives, with lots of clever ways to dispatch foes... but just as it encourages using all these, it discourages combat altogether with the chaos system. Ultimately despite its faults (which are few), Dishonored is a unique, extremely enjoyable game that I whole-heartedly recommend to any fan of stealth-action games, or anyone who's looking for something outside the current norm of gaming.","February 16, 2013","true","16.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

Non lethal options are a good thing in games and as a result I didn't even see the melee kill animations. I think I killed 3 people throughout the whole story and that was unavoidable to help the characters I wanted to help (as far as I could tell). Really enjoyed finding alternative ways to "assassinate" my target without killing them, for instance branding a man a heretic so he'd be exiled was a favourite... just because it was so smoothly done.\n\nAll in all a great game, but not a game I'd rate super highly just because it isn't generally my thing sneaking around etc. I recognise quality when I play it though.\n\nGlad I waited until it was cheaper, and will certainly recommend it to anyone who asks.","November 18, 2013","true","15.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nico-Kun/recommended/205100/","Nico-Kun","¤ βℓооđч ¤ Nico-Kun!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Nico-Kun/","653 products in account","An excellent game with a mix of stealth and action gameplay, Dishonored is set in a steampunk world with some magic thrown it it. The story is set in the Empire of the Isles, and follows Corvo, Royal Protector of the Empress, who's wrongly accused of murdering the empress and kidnapping her daugther. However, the day before his execution, he's freed from prison by a group of loyalists who seek to stop the real conspirators.\n\nThe game is filled with many interesting characters, including the aforementioned loyalists, and the members of the conspiracy. There's also some mysterious characters, most notably the Outsider, who gives his mark to Corvo, granting him supernatural powers, all of which are really fun to use, and offer a nice variety, whether you go for a stealth-based approach, or want to kill everything in your path; which, by the way, are both perfectly valid ways to play this game.\n\nA great thing of the game is, like I mentioned above, the different paths it offers. And it's not as simple as two paths, you can actually approach your targets in several ways; you can even get through the whole game using only your weapons, without ever touching the powers; you can kill everybody in front of you, or you can finish the game without killing anybody, including your targets, as the game offers different ways of dealing with them. Something to keep in mind, though, is that your actions affect the world; the city in which the game takes place, Dunwall (capital of the Empire of the Isles), is afflicted by a strange plague, carried by rats, and the more chaos you cause, the more rats there are, and the more dangerous the city gets, leading to different endings depending on the overall chaos.\n\nAs far as environments go, they're really good. The city is somewhat reminiscent of Half-Life's City 17, which should come as no surprise, considering that Viktor Antonov, who designed the environments for Half-Life 2, worked in this game as well. Even some of the enemies might remind you of ones encountered through Half-Life 2. However, don't think this is a bad thing; even though there are similarities, the overall tone of the game, of a steampunk nature, makes the city feel pretty unique. There's also many pathways to get through the different levels, depending, once again, on the approach you wish to take; and also many areas that you can explore, even when they're not directly related to your mission.\n\nAs for gameplay, I've already talked about it in the above paragraphs. Something I haven't mentioned is that you always dual-wield your sword (on the right hand) along another weapon (or power). This leads to a very dynamic combat system, where you can attack enemies at a distance, while defending yourself in close combat. There's also several powers that allow for easier movement across the levels (from teleportation, to possessing animals, or even human NPCs), and others that give new combat options (like summoning rats to attack your enemies). Then there's the bone charms, which grant you passive effects as long as you have them equipped, enhancing your abilities.\n\nThe story is excellent; as I mentioned, it starts with the death of the Empress. After Corvo escapes from prison, he joins the loyalists, and starts going against the conspirators, weakening the power of the Lord Regent, who was behind it all. Depending on what you do, you can even learn more about the plague that's destroying the city, or you can simply get your revenge on those that wronged you.\n\nSo, to conclude this review, Dishonored is an excellent game. Great story, great visuals, great characters. It's become one of my favourite games, and I'm eagerly waiting for the sequel. It should be more than obvious that I recommend this game.","March 8","true","46.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

You think about\nher as you run along rain-slicked marble walls\nand drab stone architecture, with the magical\ntattoo on your hand's exterior glowing yellow\nand blue.\n\nDISHONORED.\n\nFramed for the murder of the beloved Ruler\nof the City of Dunwall, Empress Jessamine\nKaldwin, you take the role of Corvo Attano,\ndisgraced Royal Bodyguard-turned-deadly,\nsupernaturally-powered-assassin.\n\nGranted a vast array of paranormally-charged\npowers by the strange, ever-watchful Outsider,\nthe world is yours to either silently navigate to\nsave the city from an all-consuming plague and\ngovernment corruption, or for you to unleash\nmayhem and wreak bloody havoc upon those\nwho have wronged you.\n\nDishonored's world draws you in with its rich,\nmeticulously-crafted nuances and mythology\nscattered from minute notes to unspoken\nbaroque and gothic-styled overtones from\natmosphere to architecture.\n\nDishonored's mission and level design rank\nhighly in terms of effort put in and time spent\nmaking these levels become a reality. Each\nchoice made, whether you choose to spare or\nkill whoever stands in your wayhas lasting\nconsequences upon the outcome of the story,\nin what the game explains as 'Chaos.'\n\nComplete the game in High Chaos, and you see\nthe city of Dunwall plunged into a new Dark Age,\nbased on your choices and a playthrough of a\nviolent killer. Complete the game in Low Chaos,\nand Dunwall is spared a grim fate, and the new\nEmpress, Emily Kaldwin- daughter of Jessamine\nKaldwin- will reign in a new Golden Age, in part\ndue to your efforts in a non-lethal, stealth-based\nplaythrough.\n\nYou realize then, after playing the mission to\nretrieve Emily from a posh brothel called the\nGolden Cat, that the game's model of Emily in\nher white dress looks eerily similar, as if you\nhave seen it on someone before, in the past.\n\nIt hits you then. This is not the first time that\nyou have seen the girl in white. There was the\nschool dance and there was this bombshell in\nthe form-fitting white dress, golden bangs and\nher black bob-cut. She was alone and at the\ntime, Ms. Novocaine was running an hour late,\nbut there were rumours that your girlfriend was\ndoing improper things with the sports jocks.\n\nYou invited her to dance, the girl in white.\n\nYou danced with Summer-Rain, once upon a time.\n\nA thread of drool drips unconsciously from your\nhalf-open mouth as your mind wandered. Your\neyes snap back to reality, wiping your mouth\nwith whatever time you can muster before the\nguards are upon you in one of the greatest\nDishonored missions, Lady Boyle's Last Party.\n\nYou infiltrated the mansion, mingled with the\nguests. You had to identify which of the three\nBoyle triplets she was, and choose a method\nto eliminate the target. You went for your\nfolding sword and stabbed the Boyle sister in\nwhite while you had your flashback epiphany.\n\nYou save and exit Dishonored before sitting at\nthe foot of your bed, dialling her number and\nwaiting with baited breath. "Hello?" The line\npicks up, and Summer-Rain's sweet voice\nwashes over your shaken form. "Hey. You\nalright there?" She chimes.\n\n"I remember. That night, when Ms. Novocaine\ndidn't turn up. We danced the night away, but\nin the morning, you were gone. I woke up on\nthat hill overlooking town alone." Silence from\nacross the line, then you can almost feel her\nsmile from the receiver.\n\n"You knew, didn't you? About Ms. Novocaine."\n\nSummer-Rain's tears fall freely now. Her sobs\necho in your ear and through your heart, and\nonce again, the Outsider whispers daggers to\nboth you and Summer-Rain.\n\n"Even when we were children, I loved you.\nLoved you from a distance." Summer-Rain\nwhispers, her voice making you wince in\ninvoluntary pain.\n\n"But who could ever love Summer-Rain, who\nherself was once just like Ms. Novocaine?"\nSummer-Rain playfully says, mocking herself.\n\n"Pretty."\n\n"Spoiled."\n\n"Dishonored."\n\nThe line goes dead.\n\n"By the Outsider." You start, looking\nat your empty hands, breathing slowly.\n"Hear me. Grant me the strength to win\nover Summer-Rain, and heal her heart."\n\nYou clench your hands, and have never\nfelt more sure in your life. "Grant me an\nendless love for Summer-Rain that will\nbe the stuff of legends, O' Outsider."\n\n","November 10, 2015","true","88.0"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","7","11","0","0"

But here, guards keep popping out of no where, and dark vision does f*ck all to see them, I know it has a range, BUT WHEN THE RANGE IS 2CM, THEN WE HAVE AN ISSUE, other then that, Stealth CAN work sometimes, most of the time guards just insta spot me while I'm hiding in the shadows, so I'm forced to go in guns blazing 75% of the time.\n\nAlso smashing glasses does f*ck all, not joking, I smashed a glass in a guards face and he did nothing, didn't move, didn't attack until I walked infront of him....\n\n- The Story is unintresting, while in the beginning it plays the obvious parent is gonna die and the child is gonna be kidnapped card, thats the only intresting thing, rest of it is boring and I keep finding myself skipping them.\n\n- Some powers are no where as good as the others, like I mentioned Dark vision works whenever it feels like it, Blink is broken and is the only power you should use, freezing time while fun, is only good for escapes or quick kills, Devoring Storm is nearly useless, and the Wind Power is decent.\n\n- Some cutscenes can't be skipped, while others can..... why?\n\n- All company logos can't be skipped.... why?\n\nOther then that, this game is a lot fun.","December 30, 2014","true","10.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While they may not always have real consequences (mostly affecting the chaos rating of the city), they give the player the feeling of freedom.\n\nI'm almost done with my second playthrough. The first one was magic-using sneaker, where I only killed people if they caught me by surprise. While it was quite nice, finding alternative routes and hiding all the sleeping bodies, the second playthrough has been so much better.\n\nFor a game that rewards you for being a good guy (sneaking, not killing), being a badass warrior is too damn fun. While I don't use any magic on this run, the feeling of battling half a dozen guards at once is amazing. Blink behind, stab, shoot another one to the face, lob a sticky grenade on one, blink away from explosion, lock your sword with the last one and remove his head. It is frankly quite intoxicating.\n\nAlso, seeing all the differences between different runs make you appreciate the game much more, even if the differences are small.\n\nThe fact that you can be shot or stabbed in the back while swordfighting another guard, is really good compared to Batman / Assassin's Creed type of combo-counter brawl. You have to think ahead or be ready to use your weapons, you can't just jump in the middle of a group of hostiles.\n\n10/10 would play again (almost did already)","November 25, 2014","true","39.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While I don't use any magic on this run, the feeling of battling half a dozen guards at once is amazing. Blink behind, stab, shoot another one to the face, lob a sticky grenade on one, blink away from explosion, lock your sword with the last one and remove his head. It is frankly quite intoxicating.\n\nAlso, seeing all the differences between different runs make you appreciate the game much more, even if the differences are small.\n\nThe fact that you can be shot or stabbed in the back while swordfighting another guard, is really good compared to Batman / Assassin's Creed type of combo-counter brawl.

It has a detailed and well constructed world, a great story (or stories, as the expansions give you another great storyline running concurrent with the original), memorable characters, and interesting challenges and achievements. Also, if you aren't turned off by binary moral choice systems you can play through each story multiple times. You should also definitely get the game of the year addition 'cause the expansions are absolutely worth it.\nA word to the wise, you should probably decide before you start whether you plan to be good or to do some of the longer achievements like Ghost cause you can't start after the fact.","January 2, 2015","true","216.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can go one of four ways:\n1) Complete stealth; nobody ever detects you at all and you only knock people out.\n2) No kills; you may be seen but you never kill\n3) Some kills; you may be seen and you try not to kill, but when it needs to happen it does\n4) Rambo; you run into any fight and kill everyone.\nDepending on what you choose, the game has three different outcomes based off your "chaos" level. Higher and lower chaos will affect different things as well as change the last level.\nThe swordfighting mechanics are great and you will never survive a fight using just the sword in a group of 3+. Using your magic powers via the Outsider's mark you can stop time, teleport around and generally have fun. Plot is simple but passable. Definitely a game worth multiple playthroughs, and each one may vary in time. A kill-everyone run takes only about 8 hours while a full stealth could take up to 30-40 hours. The DLC is very fun, in the Knife of Dunwall and the Brigmore Witches you get to play as an antagonist from the main game, the assassin Daud. The only other DLC currently is the Dunwall City Trials, which are very fun for everyone.","December 9, 2013","true","42.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

On one side I loved the graphics, the style and voice actors and the music. I also loved the level design and overall the great freedom it was given to the player.....BUT this freedom was taken back due to the STUPID Chaos system present in the game. Which chaos you get influence the endings, problem is that chaos level is not affected by how stealthy you play but how many people you kill. I did a lethal stealth gameplay (never discovered/killed all the guards) and got the bad ending. Basically the story forced my gameplay, if you want a good ending you should not kill anyone which is bad. Non-lethal gamplay is boring and made a lot of powers and gadgets useless and restrict your options. This thing really ruined the game for me.\n\nHowever if we put this thing apart you get a solid game, with good levels and lots of fun. DLCs are a must have in this game. If what I mentioned earlier is not a problem then go for it, it's really a satisfying game to play. Personally I enjoyed Daud story more over Corvo's so I highly recommend all DLCs (except the trials of Dunwall that are useless).","July 18, 2014","true","32.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

On one side I loved the graphics, the style and voice actors and the music. I also loved the level design and overall the great freedom it was given to the player.....BUT this freedom was taken back due to the STUPID Chaos system present in the game. Which chaos you get influence the endings, problem is that chaos level is not affected by how stealthy you play but how many people you kill. I did a lethal stealth gameplay (never discovered/killed all the guards) and got the bad ending. Basically the story forced my gameplay, if you want a good ending you should not kill anyone which is bad. Non-lethal gamplay is boring and made a lot of powers and gadgets useless and restrict your options. This thing really ruined the game for me.\n\nHowever if we put this thing apart you get a solid game, with good levels and lots of fun. DLCs are a must have in this game. If what I mentioned earlier is not a problem then go for it, it's really a satisfying game to play. Personally I enjoyed Daud story more over Corvo's so I highly recommend all DLCs (except the trials of Dunwall that are useless).","July 18, 2014","true","32.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's such a unique and refreshing game.\nVery hard to stop playing. The world they created is amazing and has so much potential for many sequels. However, the story is very contained within this one game. Plenty of closure. It's a very intriguing story, too. I heard people calling the story weak, but it most certainly is not.\n\nYou can play the game in a variety of ways. No killing, plenty of killing, balanced, whatever. There are quite a few ways to approach every part of every mission. There are some choices you can make in the game that does effect some dialogue and some more subtle things throughout the game, depending on what it is.\n\nIt's got tons of replay value and plenty of secrets to find. You could play through it 3, 4, maybe even 5 times before you've seen everything that can happen in the game. Like I said, though, it's mostly subtle stuff, but I like that. It's not for everyone, but man, I applaud Arkane (a relatively untested studio until now) on their excellent work on this game.\n\nIf you like BioShock, you'd probably love this game. But again, it really isn't just another rehash of other games. You might could say it takes some of the best gameplay elements from a number of games and combines them to create something special and unique.\n\nReally fun. It's also already got a little expansion to the game, and Bethesda is teasing more DLC to come. I sure hope there will be more!","July 16, 2013","true","20.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The first time I ever heard dishonored was when I was looking up a list of B games. I was buying some games for my Xbox, and saw that this game was getting great reviews from people. At the time it was only 25$ so I got it along with some others and waited a little while to play it. I can easily say this is one of my favorite games of all time. I am normally against stealth games, but this game is so different.\n\nThis game is my "Half-life". I eagerly await a sequel in any form. I could describe why this game is good, but I doubt I could do it justice. I will say that it has thrilling story, fun and non-limited game play as well as a new type of art design. Without taking the extreme graphic engine approach, Arcane made a game that looks vivid and nice all around.\n\nThis game is a solid 10/10. Generally with a good game, at some point I would say something like "I don't agree with this decision but its not a big deal". However, with Dishonored I never found myself saying that. Even the DLC game of the year content that I only recently tried has been great!

Dishonored casts you as Corvo Attano, recently banished from your home by false accusations of murder. Now with you out of the picture, inner forces of Dunwall seek to break it apart from the inside. It is your job to uncover the true murderer... How far will you go to prove your innocence, and will you become a monster trying to? Dishonored has a unique and thrilling storyline, with a conjoined weapon and power system.

Some people call Corvo, the protagonist, boring and characterless, but what's facinating is the effect that your actions  - and by extension, Corvo - has on those around him.\nPeople treat you differently by way of subtle changes in speech or tone and the lasting effect on one particular character is nothing short of brilliant.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, Dishonored isn't perfect. The stealth mechanics are pretty close to perfect, with leaning around corners, clearly visible alert warnings and a multitude of clever ways to get around without being seen, but it falls apart a bit in the combat. Corvo is heralded as a master of arms, able to 'beat three men at once', as a guard can be heard saying. Ironically, fighting more than one person at a time can be infuriatingly difficult. And that's on moderate settings.\nBecause almost all NPCs use a combination of sword and pistol, you can cross swords only to be shot at point blank range by someone you can't stop, they can kick you; an unblockable attack that deals as much damage as a bullet, or they can just swing their sword as you jump backwards out of range and hit you anyway. Their sword range is about three times the length of their sword and you must block every single hit.\n\nThe killy death tools are nicely varied, allowing for very stylish kills with grenades, crossbow bolts and shrapnel mines, and that's not even touching on the supernatural powers. Adding them, the game becomes a flowing action of combat adding a clever third dimension to swordplay (at least the way I fight). Aside from just jumping and teleporting high, time manipulation, rat control and blasts of wind are just some of the tricks you can use.\nAdmittedly, you'll probably find one or two powers that you use more than the others, but the options are there to experiment.\n\nWhile the story can be a bit predictable, it serves as a good framing device to take you across the breadth of Dunwall, killing and stalking people of all kinds. Also all of the cutscenes are skippable for those who want to try speedruns.\n\nThe DLC is an interesting topic, allowing a new perspective on the story as well as some different powers and amazing sprawling levels.\n\nThe downside of these slow, stealth-based games is they can be lacking in F**k Yeah moments, but Dishonored makes up for that in lasting enjoyment, replayability and a world that you can be lost in for days.","February 10, 2015","true","94.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","3"

You may be able to see the end coming from miles away, but it is still an enjoyable trip getting there. I was a bit concerned at the abrupt start to the game with no true backstory besides a paragraph of text.

Arkane Studios have created a compelling game that ticks just about all the right boxes for me. It looks great, with very striking design and a unique painterly style. The city of Dunwall is beautifully realised and is a joy to explore. The gameplay successfully fuses the use of powers and weapons and the choice between stealth and combat is nicely balanced. The mission design is quite varied and allows for a number of ways to complete each one, thus offering decent replay value. The voice acting is always convincing, thanks to a star-studded cast, and the story is reasonable, although not strikingly original. Where it falls short is in the level of humour. Aside from one amusing line about someone not wearing pants I don’t recall there being many laughs along the way. And that’s a shame, because if not for the lack of humour I would have given DISHONORED a full score. 4.5/5","August 11, 2014","true","31.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It has a lot of replay value because you can do every level in so many different ways. I've spent atleast 10 hours on the Lady Boyle mission because it's fun trying to complete it in different ways. The executions are brutal so you may want to complete it atleast 2 times to see them (If you want to play stealthy aswell).  The DLC adds 2 short stories to the game where you get to play as Daud. Daud is a great character and has a few more spells than Corvo. He can summon allies and his blink stops time when he isn't moving. The Dunwall City Trials DLC is pretty fun and very challenging and has a horde mode which is amazing. I can't wait for the second game.\n\nThe only problem I have with this game is that the Guards are a bit stupid.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/caleblives/recommended/205100/","caleblives","Lead Shacks","http://steamcommunity.com/id/caleblives/","255 products in account","Don't get me wrong, Dishonored IS a good game.\nThe gameplay in it is fantastic, the setting is really cool and interesting, and the pure number of ways you can deal with just about any scenario is nothing short of awe-inspiring. However, it does have its claws, most of which settle around the story and how it frames its characters, but it's best to try to be ignorant of them if you want to get the most out of this game.\nJust play it and try not to get too invested in the story because the game won't really reward that investment.\n\nI'll list my issues below in a spoiler, but if you are even thinking about buying this game, grab it.\nCharacters as a whole never really feel like people, they come off as robotic cardboard cutouts most of the time, primarily because they don't seem to ever react to anything. This is something that if you notice it, it's hard to ignore if you are trying to get into the story. The city itself is interesting, it's just that the flatness of the characters never really makes it feel alive.\n\nThe other problem that I have with the game is how it calculates how your actions "impact" the rest of the story. Whether or not you get a good ending is mostly determined by how many people you have killed and how much general "chaos" you have created. However... I went through my playthrough taking mostly knock outs and only killing someone if I needed to silence them before they rang the other guards. Despite these tactics I was still getting high chaos ratings at the end of every mission because of the bodycount tha I was hitting.\nNone of these bodies would ever be found, and most of the people who ever saw me are now dead, and yet still, everyone knows who I am, and the city is going to hell. I'm not dropping corpses to the rats, I'm not charging guards head on, and yet the game still treats me the same way simply because of this bodycount. It's actually frustrating, because the moments where you'll find yourself seen and then have to fight your way are the BEST part of the game. Summoning a rat swarm at the top of a tower, and accidently luring all the guards in the area up the steps, then throwing a grenade too kill every one of them because I'm cornered shouldn't make me a saint. At the same time however, that's just one section out of four in the level and even if I don't kill a single soul after this I'll still get high chaos because I happened to kill eight people out of necessity.\nIt just feels like the emergent gameplay side of Dishonored conflicts with the morality system in a way that punishes the player on the story end of the game because they wanted to play Dishonored the "fun" way.\n\nAgain, fantastic game and this is a gripe I have with it, but the more you refuse to care about the morality/chaos system, the more fun you'll have.","June 16, 2015","true","29.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm not going to try to write a review, but I want to explain why I love this game so much.\n\nI love Dishonored because it puts me in a world filled with intricately linked systems and sets me free to experiment with them. Every item effects every other item in logical ways, producing a depth of interactivity that is incredibly deep, with combinations of systems coming naturally as you think about your environment as an actual world.\n\nI love that Dishonored doesn't try in vain to deliver photorealistic graphics, and instead utilizes a gorgeous visual style of watercolors and caricatures combined with surrealist lighting. Where so many other games struggle for life-like detail and end up slipping into the uncanny valley, Dishonored uses a non-realistic approach that is evocative and suggestive, making every character and locale a joy to look at.\n\nI love how Dishonored feels when I'm moving around. Every motion in the game is so beautifully smooth, from running to climbing, jumping to sliding. After playing Dishonored it's hard to go back to games where sprinting is limited and I can't jump up and grab a ledge to get over a wall. Mirror's Edge did running so well, and Dishonored surpasses it in every way.\n\nI love playing Dishonored because of all the options I've given when approaching a situation. There are countless ways through each area and multiple solutions to each objective, making stealth and combat equally viable playstyles.\n\nI could go on and on, but I'm going to cut this short. Simply put, it's a game that does nearly everything right. Every single aspect of the gameplay is masterfully crafted and polished to perfection. Buy this game. Buy it right now.","July 14, 2013","true","255.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

These thoughts press on your mind as you sit in your cell, awaiting your unfair execution. Your attention is snapped back to reality when a tray of soggy looking food is slid under the cell door, only holding your attention momentarily, except for the small piece of paper with a scrawled note on it. You pull apart the bread to find the key to your cell door hidden in it. With freedom within your grasp, and redemption close behind it, what path will you take? Will you slaughter everyone in your path, and climb your way to your goal upon a pile of corpses? Or will you slip through the shadows undetected, leaving a trace no more than the entrance guard sleeping under a bush? The choice is yours.\n\nAll in all, I really enjoyed this game, from start to finish.\nThe story, though predictable, was both emotionally engrossing and enjoyable.\nThe art style is gorgeous, the graphics breathtaking, and the effects mesmerising.\nThe gameplay is smooth, tactile, and well thought out.\nThe range of paths to a goal are almost overwhelming, whether you want to wipe a building clean, slip through undetected, or take every enemy out, one by one, like a ninja, noone aware of your presence.\nAnd finishing an objective can be acheived through various means too. Will you slaughter your target mercilessly, staring into his eyes as his consciousness slips away, will you sabotage something so his death appears accidental, or will you bribe the local gang leader to make them "disappear"\nAnd your decisions have an effect on the outcome too.

It also includes side quests to obtain 'Runes' which are used to upgrade your magic or completing some quests may earn you 'Bone Charms' which add you a slight boost to things like Attack Speed,Health,Damage and so on. You may use non-lethal or lethal ways to eliminate your enemies it's your choice. Although being lethal/non-lethal may affect your ending. You will never get bored of this game.

This mark allows you to wield great powers, like teleportation, being the main one in the game, and Stop time.\n\nAt any rate, Corvo the bodyguard is blamed for the assassination, and sentenced to death, where a group of people know as the "loyalists" save you from your fate, only  to find that you are one of the 8 men with these powers as well. after this, you, guided by the loyalists and the outsider, must then take your revenge on the cult and the ones who betrayed you. there are different DLC that enhance the game even further, but i can only handle so much awesome at a time, so we are sticking to the main game.\n\nyou can either run around like a headless chicken and stab everyone, or you can make the game ten times longer and attempt to sneak past everyone. each path has a different ending, with the sneaky one being more satisfying. it is up to you how you play dishonored. from head to toe, this game is amazing. i could not imagine a world without this game, and you would understand if you owned it.\n\nand i hope this encoraged you to purchase this amazing game.","July 26, 2014","true","54.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

And after doing a complete non-lethal stealth run through myself in one afternoon I have to agree. However keep in mind that that is just one way to play Dishonored.\n\nPersonally I feel that the game was designed so as to cater to all types of players, from those who prefer to sneak around and leave enemies unharmed to those who like to run around and dismember guards with your gadgets and blade. There are also optional quests that the player can partake in to receive runes to spend on abilities, with certain abilities further catering to specific playstyles.\n\nThe big motivating factor for me was the fact that how you play may dictate how the climax and ending plays out. I played through twice, once as a good Corvo and the other as a bad, and both times I was satisfied by the different dialogue and overall ending. Moreover, for those achievement seekers I feel that the list of achievements for this game also promotes the player to play through more than once.\n\nOne memorable chapter for me with this game was the masquerade party; I spent hours on this one level just exploring this beautifully designed area. It's like taking part in a piece of actual history, the likes of which you know does not happen anymore.\n\nOther than that, this game isn't very graphically intensive though still looks fairly good, and the combat itself is very fluid.

Personally I say this game really reminds me of Thief, although Dishonored contains a lot more murdering. I also finished the "Knife of Dunwall" which let's you play as the Assassin Daud adding some more powers, gadgets and about three more missions. The story in Dishonored is pretty damn good as well. Although bear in mind this game does contain a few flaws mostly being bugs, the pros are still way more than the cons.\nDishonored have a quite unique graphic style as well, set in a "Steam punk, Victorian age"\n\nFinal Verdict: A must buy, especially if you enjoyed the Thief franchise.","April 19, 2013","true","29.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a stealth FPS which follows the path of Corvo, who is wrongly accused of murdering the empress. So begins your journey through a vivid, interesting steam-punk world.\n\nAnyone into the Thief games or stealth in general will find something to like here. This game however, also features an impressive ability set of "magical" powers that you can acquire through runes and bone charms throughout the game. Some of these completely change the way you approach situations and are most welcome additions.\n\nThe only thing I was not to keen on was this "choice" you have over low or high chaos (stealth and not killing anyone or slaughtering everyone in your path). The game keeps on telling you to not kill people if you want the "good" ending, yet by doing so you miss out on some of the most fun powers and mechanics in the game. It's saying, here is an arsenal of cool stuff, but don't use them.\n\nAnyway, a great game in most respects that I would recommend to anyone interested in the genre.\n\nJimbo Rating: 7/10","July 20, 2014","true","23.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

During the game you will come across artifacts that give you points to spend on certian power ups such as the abillity to telleport, use possesion or summon rats.\n\nDishonored takes advantage of this with its open ended level design, there will be some places that can be difficult to get to without certian power ups, but there are usualy three or four ways to aproach each objectaive, for example in one mission you need to get to go from the start to your objectaive, to get there you could either... posses a fish and go though the gates to the sewers, have a good enough blink or jump abillity to run on top of the roofs and destroy the watch towers, walk through the back streets and go through waves of zombie like creatures  or just run through the middle of the big roads and most likly get yourself killed unless you are patient and carefull.\n\nThe world of dunwall is an amazingly crafted world, affected by a huge plage, with abbandoned streets and houses to the sewers over run by zobie-like biengs roaming around. This is a world that was made with great detail and a nice victorian style.\n\nThe story is decent, starting of with you being framed for a murder you now stride though the land, DISHONORED ;)\nand the rest of the story unfolds aroud that.\n\nThe game has multable endings but I have never been abl to get the best one. I have beat the game twice and the endings were different, although i did not know what caused it to be different. In one of my endings one of your closest allies in the game was slightly hostile towards the end of the game, he was not like that in my other playthough.\nThere are two major endings one is the "good ending" and the other is obiously the "bad ending" I have never managed to get the "good ending" but to get  it you have to apperently not kill as many people and help develop the city and not destroy it. On my second play though were I played in the hardest difficulty and  only really knocked a few people out I still got one of the bad endings so there is probably more factores into the endings but I am not fully aware.\n\nAs you go through the game the world either gets darker filled with more zombie infested lands or a brighter land filled with more guards. http://i.imgur.com/YV6gt.jpg?1\nsome of the side missions also affect things in the area and in future levels where you revisit certian areas.\n\nThe combat to the game is very fast in fun with many weapos to use although I didn't use it much due to me usually sneaking past everyone.\n\nThe game is around a 7.5-9 GB dowlaod and should probably work pretty well on most newish pc's.\nI did not experience any crash issues.\n\nI have not bought or played any of the DLC for this game, but the game is still very good without it.\n\nI managed to beat this game in around 10 hours. It may not be the longest time for a game but I had fun the whole way though, and the replay value is insane as well.\n\nDishonerd is a game that I could recomend to pretty much anyone, eiether stealth fans or other people the game gives very different experiences depending on the difficulty and which the style of the player they prefer.\nDishonored is one of those games like Skyrim where everyone has a diffent experience and can talk to someone else who has played at and has a completely diffrent story to tell.\n\nDishonored Is a game where it is just fun to mess around in and just stay in an area and just messing around with each abllity and was an enjoyable game from start to finish.\nI would recomend this to anyone looking for a unique stealth experience.\n\n9.5/10","April 24, 2015","true","29.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Dishonored is a stealth based First person action game. The best part of the game is the choices, although the dialogues don't contain a lot of choices the gameplay does. You can play as I played my first play-through, spare everyone or just be a crazy killer using a lot of cool spells. Many see Dishonored as Assassin Creed in first person. Personally I say this game really reminds me of Thief, although Dishonored contains a lot more murdering. I also finished the "Knife of Dunwall" which let's you play as the Assassin Daud adding some more powers, gadgets and about three more missions. The story in Dishonored is pretty damn good as well. Although bear in mind this game does contain a few flaws mostly being bugs, the pros are still way more than the cons.\nDishonored have a quite unique graphic style as well, set in a "Steam punk, Victorian age"\n\nFinal Verdict: A must buy, especially if you enjoyed the Thief franchise.","April 19, 2013","true","29.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is able to balance well the action and stealth gameplay with a great level design. It is a game that allows you to play as you like without feeling to be railroaded or punished by adopting a certain play style or paths. Thus its replayability is high, even if the story feels like a fatality which you can't change much the outcome. However you can influence its morality, not by making the classical RPG two sided choices but by actually playing the game, each of your actions weights in the final result, which is quite an innovative game design standpoint that makes this game so special. On the pure artistic standpoint, it has a distinct personality that cast it apart from most productions. While a lot of the actual material and fluff of this game is purely optional, if you actually make a halt in your journey, read, watch and listen to all Dishonored has to offer you may discover it has a lot to say behind the actual game.","October 31, 2012","true","36.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You can go a stealth approach and look for alternative pathways, and you can even go for a non-lethal solution in every mission. Or you can use all your powers and weaponry and have a good old slaughter.\n\nWhat is really interesting is how the game is affected by your actions. Murder without restraint and you end up with a darker version of reality. Or keep it under wraps and keep things a little less chaotic.\n\nThe graphics of this game are something unique, in an art style that suits the somewhat Steampunk dystopian world. The level design is done well, plenty of nooks to explore but without getting lost. Alternative solutions to each mission make it replayable, and in two runs you can get all achievements if you so chose to. 'Hardcore' gamers will find joy in doing a non-lethal playthrough with no powers used, but there are also challenges for pushing certain skill combinations to the limit. And with the game being chopped into mission parts, which none the less flow into each other, you can easily sit down and play just a little bit.\n\nThe downside? It's a short game. DLC is cheap enough however, and you do get a quality experience for it which isn't dragged out because a game should be X hours long.","January 27, 2013","true","49.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Com uma história de vingança não muito criativa mas competente e gráficos bonitos, ainda que não magníficos, mas com um gameplay diferenciado dos clássicos do gênero (e muito bom por sinal), esse jogo garante um bom tempo de diversão, especialmente pra quem curte stealth mas está um tanto cansado do combate com armas à distância e a perspectiva em terceira pessoa. A ambientação do jogo também é digna de nota, com uma boa variedade de cenários bem contruídos, ainda que não muito extensos, em sua maioria. Os locais que você visita passam competentemente a sensação de abandono e desolação que a história quer passar.

The game is well-balanced. If you like to use your brain and stealth, this game offers you a nice challenge. If you prefer the more ruthless approach; go hogwild!\n\nPlayer advice:\nSave early, save often.\n\nBugs:\nNo major problems encountered.\n\nCould be better:\nI would have liked to see that Corvo had a little more personality.

You are set to assasinate and extract high valued targets that put you into prison and fight to overthrow the new corrupt Lord Regent. Play how you want to play in this action-stealth filled game, do you want to be a ghost who sneaks in the shadows and prefers non-lethal or do you want to go in with explosive shot pistol rounds and fight your way to your targets. The game makes great use of both with the blink power which is one of the better ideas I've seen in gaming in a while allowing you to short-distance teleport to either sneak around or counter and flank. I will say the game starts off rather slow and your more inclined to choose full frontal assault until you get your powers and learn the game a bit, but once you start it becomes very fun exploring the various routes and paths around enemies and blockades on your way to your targets. One of the few downsides is the dialogue, there arn't many recorded lines for npc's as they say will you hear about cigars and whisky, the chances are very good. 8/10","February 14, 2015","true","22.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a stealth FPS which follows the path of Corvo, who is wrongly accused of murdering the empress. So begins your journey through a vivid, interesting steam-punk world.\n\nAnyone into the Thief games or stealth in general will find something to like here. This game however, also features an impressive ability set of "magical" powers that you can acquire through runes and bone charms throughout the game. Some of these completely change the way you approach situations and are most welcome additions.\n\nThe only thing I was not to keen on was this "choice" you have over low or high chaos (stealth and not killing anyone or slaughtering everyone in your path). The game keeps on telling you to not kill people if you want the "good" ending, yet by doing so you miss out on some of the most fun powers and mechanics in the game. It's saying, here is an arsenal of cool stuff, but don't use them.\n\nAnyway, a great game in most respects that I would recommend to anyone interested in the genre.\n\nJimbo Rating: 7/10","July 20, 2014","true","23.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's very dark outside, only a miserable streetlight covering just a small part of the street; the gate. You know your life depends on what lies beyond the hard metal monster, you must get past it. You can't do anything but wait for now, so you decide to take a good look at it. You see sharp, steel pins on the top, so you know climbing over of it won't be an option. The door itself is toughened steel with a modern lock that you will never be able to pick. The gate is surrounded by many guards, and only one of them has the key. Then, suddenly, a guard leaves the group, probably for a small patrol round. You see him coming closer, and closer. You grab your knife and tighten your muscles. He is almost in range of the garbagecan. You wait for one more second, quickly pull him out of the enemies line of sight, and cut his throat. Blood gushes out of the open wound and your heart beats like crazy, while you search his pockets. And, nothing. God damn it, you can almost punch the ground out of anger. You think by yourself: 'you know what, f*ck this sh*t.' You grab a grenade, pull the pin and you hurl the explosive towards the enemies. You quickly hide behind the trash can and almost inmediatly hear the detonation. You look up. Everybody is dead.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pay4colleg/recommended/205100/","pay4colleg","Baaaaka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pay4colleg/","111 products in account","This game. Man. This game. Right, so Arkane Studios had me at hello. Every game they had something to do with development in; I loved. Dark Messiah: Might & Magic was the first game I ever played by them, and man. I PLAYED THE MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF THAT GAME. Then Bioshock 2, CoD: WaW (level design).\n\nThis review might be slightly biased due to my love for both Bethesda and Arkane Studios; so heed my warning. I am also not judging the DLC that had been released for Dishonored, for I haven't even touched it.\n\nRight, so after 85 hours, I can rightfully say that I practically know most of the game, inside and out. Played it on the hardest difficulty without killing anyone and without being spotted once through the entire playthrough.\n\nSo a brief rundown on what Dishonored is. It's a stealth based action game, based in a steampunk Victorian Britain. It's very much a "choose your own path" game. You can run through it without killing a single being, or without being noticed by anyone; or you can get spotted by every one and decapitate them to your heart's content. Most of the level design also allows you to play through a map multiple  times, finding lots of ways to clear them.\n\nThe game is very story intensive. But the beauty of it is; if you don't wish to explore the lore and story of every inch of the game's setting... Then don't. There are hundreds of books in the game. I literally mean hundreds. Which tell you the story of Dunwall and the isles that surround it. And you can choose to read none of them.\n\nIt's hard to say what's wrong with the game, for I can't think of much... The AI is pretty good, along with the stealth. It's one of the games which make me happy because the fact you're in the shadow, doesn't make you completely invisible; it just makes you less visible. The sword-play is simple and fun to use.

The game takes place in a plague-ravaged, post-industrial world where the main source of power is derived from refined whale oil, which has somewhat mystical properties it seems. However, despite the engineering marvels of the day, there are also supernatural forces at play that bestow the player character with magic abilities.\n\nFor my very first time playing through the game, I chose the hardest difficulty available, turned off the 'cheaty' UI elements such as objective markers, and avoided using magic entirely (with the exception of the two or three places you absolutely must use Blink).\n\nThese are some of the things the game gets right:\n- The atmosphere is quite unique\n- There are a great number of ways to go about navigating through the missions\n- You can choose non-lethal alternatives to completing objectives\n- Graphics are very decent\n- Smooth controls\n- The game provides options for disabling UI elements, such as floating objective markers and NPC awareness markers.\n\nThese are some of my criticisms and observations:\n- First of all, the Game of the Year edition comes with pre-order packs that give the player a bunch of free upgrades and money after the first mission. ♥♥♥♥ that! Why do game publishers do this? Thankfully, it is possible to get rid of the free ♥♥♥♥ by disabling the pre-order packs in Steam settings, then starting a new game.\n- The plot of the story is extremely clichéd and predictable.\n- The game introduces quite a bit of mystery surrounding the supernatural agent that your character comes in contact with, however there doesn't seem to be a story resolution that explains its motives. As a result, it feels like a shallow way to write in game-mechanics rather than being about good storytelling.\n- While the missions themselves provide a lot of leeway as to how you go about completing them, the actual story progression is entirely linear. The choices the player makes ultimately have no impact the way the events of the story unfold.\n- Enemies repeat the same lines over and over, which gets old very quickly.\n- The characters you encounter throughout the game are fairly interesting, but your ways of interacting with them are extremely limited. They often feel like walking tape recorders set up to play their few lines of dialogue, rather than actual people.\n- The game pushes you toward dealing with threats through lethal means by giving you a substantial arsenal of deadly weapons. Actually using them generally throws the concept of stealth out the window though.\n- Very early on in the game, you get the Blink ability (teleport) as part of a tutorial and you can also choose to get Dark Vision (see through walls) immediately after. These abilities in particular make the gameplay utterly trivial. It is possible to use these an unlimited number of times and quickly speed through the game.\n\nOverall Dishonored is a game worth playing, but I don't recommend it highly.","November 8, 2015","true","38.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Right, so Arkane Studios had me at hello. Every game they had something to do with development in; I loved. Dark Messiah: Might & Magic was the first game I ever played by them, and man. I PLAYED THE MOTHER ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥ OUT OF THAT GAME. Then Bioshock 2, CoD: WaW (level design).\n\nThis review might be slightly biased due to my love for both Bethesda and Arkane Studios; so heed my warning. I am also not judging the DLC that had been released for Dishonored, for I haven't even touched it.\n\nRight, so after 85 hours, I can rightfully say that I practically know most of the game, inside and out. Played it on the hardest difficulty without killing anyone and without being spotted once through the entire playthrough.\n\nSo a brief rundown on what Dishonored is. It's a stealth based action game, based in a steampunk Victorian Britain. It's very much a "choose your own path" game. You can run through it without killing a single being, or without being noticed by anyone; or you can get spotted by every one and decapitate them to your heart's content. Most of the level design also allows you to play through a map multiple  times, finding lots of ways to clear them.\n\nThe game is very story intensive. But the beauty of it is; if you don't wish to explore the lore and story of every inch of the game's setting... Then don't. There are hundreds of books in the game. I literally mean hundreds. Which tell you the story of Dunwall and the isles that surround it. And you can choose to read none of them.\n\nIt's hard to say what's wrong with the game, for I can't think of much... The AI is pretty good, along with the stealth. It's one of the games which make me happy because the fact you're in the shadow, doesn't make you completely invisible; it just makes you less visible. The sword-play is simple and fun to use. The powers are great too.\n\nHowever, I note that it's quite irritating when you want to play a complete passive game; and it forces you to equip your sword at all times. I would prefer to wield two powers in each hand, rather than have my sword constantly there; even if I weren't to use it.\n\nOverall; I believe the game has a beautiful art-style and setting; great game-play, and it often makes you feel ♥♥♥♥ing awesome after you've successfully done something. Like if you choke-out a guard, get spotted; toss the knocked-out guard into the one that spotted you; making him stumble to the floor before you jump ontop of him and slice his neck open.\n\nThere are probably loads of negatives I've missed out, but like I said.

Disappoints with a predictable main storyline.\n\n*Spoiler free. Combined review discussing Dishonored, Dunwall City Trials, The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches.*\n\nI've never been a fan of the silent protagonist. Dishonored and its two DLCs, "The Knife of Dunwall" and "The Brigmore Witches" present an interesting opportunity to play as both a silent and a voiced protagonist within essentially the same game. The main game has you playing as Corvo Attano who has a backstory but is otherwise a blank slate for you to control. Both DLCs put you behind the eyes of Daud, an assassin that you first run in to as Corvo. It would have been jarring to suddenly strip Daud of the voice he had in the original game, so he retains it into the DLCs and, in my opinion, they are better for it.\n\nAs Corvo, you sit and listen as characters monologue at you or talk to each other. As Daud, you have conversations, relationships and motives of your own. Giving your protagonist a voice makes him or her interesting, allows for natural conversations and doesn't force the game's writers to avoid lines that would normally elicit a response. And it doesn't come at the cost of robbing players of making choices at key moments, as the DLCs demonstrate.\n\nThere are positives to get to, but let me get through one more negative first. Dishonored's primary story and characters are mostly predictable, standard fare. NPCs are limited to the aforementioned monologues that are generally kept short in favor of gameplay. Both DLCs are significantly better in this regard but don't expect RPG levels of depth. The voice acting, however, is all around excellent.\n\nThe main attraction of Dishonored is its gameplay. It's a fusion of stealth, parkour, magic, and both melee and ranged combat. All slickly delivered from a first-person perspective. Besides the blink spell (short range teleport), you are given the choice of what spells and upgrades you want to unlock first to best match your play style. There are two general play styles that result in different endings to the game: the nonlethal (often stealthy) "low chaos" path and the "high chaos" path that revels in death and battle. This is true in the DLCs as well. Whichever style you choose, the level design will allow you numerous ways to get around and sometimes multiple ways to accomplish an objective. Game length can vary wildly with high chaos being the quicker route.\n\nWhile Dishonored's story may be lackluster, the atmosphere of the world it takes place in is wonderful. The art and sound design both excel at bringing this place to life. The soundtrack takes a more subtle, atmospheric approach that gets the job done but is otherwise unremarkable. You'll find notes and books scattered throughout the game that fill in the details of what goes on in this world. I hesitate to list this as a complaint, but there is a spell that significantly alters how the world looks for the worse but is so useful that I rarely turned it off. It allows you to see enemies through walls while tinting everything orange (similar to the Batman Arkham games' detective mode).\n\nDunwall City Trials is exactly what it sounds like it is: purely gameplay. No story, no impactful player choices, just arcade style pursuit of high scores. I would suggest replaying the rest of the game at a different chaos level than your first playthrough and then if you're still hungry for more, play these.\n\nDishonored: 7/10 --- 16 hours*\nDunwall City Trials: 5/10 --- 3 hours*\nThe Knife of Dunwall: 8/10 --- 6 hours, no alerts or kills*\nThe Brigmore Witches: 8/10 --- 7 hours, no alerts or kills*\n(* estimated playtime for my single low chaos playthrough)","April 7, 2015","true","35.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

So, of course, I purchased it and got a bit obsessed. I dropped path of the exile, which had been consuming most of my time, and started playing. I ripped through the first level or two attempting stealth, but mostly ending up killing people. By the third level, I decided to go with a non-violent route.\n\nNow, I’m going to stop right here and talk about how the general public has been treating Dishonored. Most people compare it to Assassin’s Creed, largely for two main reasons. Firstly, it released around the same time as the third Assassin’s Creed. Secondly, some of the gameplay has hints of Assassin’s Creed. This is a rather unfair comparision, however, and I’ll tell you why.\n\nThe first thing that struck me while I was playing this game in a more stealthy method, is that you’re stuck in first person the whole time. To most people, this is meaningless, it simply makes it a “bad stealth game”. To those of us, however, that grew up playing Thief: The Dark Project, I instantly switched to Thief mode. Yes, first person view does make it harder to be stealthy. However, unlike Thief, you can lean around corners in Dishonored. Yes, shadows don’t make you invisible in Dishonored, but so what? They don’t make you invisible in real life, either. Shadows were a mainstay in Thief, but in Dishonored, they weren’t as vital.\n\nIn Dishonored, you exchange shadows for ledges. In fact, the game is best played for stealth, if you’re good at thinking in 3d spaces. You cannot perform the parkour of Assassin’s Creed, but you’re not as clunky as in Thief. Thief relied on shadows, because you simply didn’t have the fluidity in the game to duck behind corners, or vault onto ledges. Dishonored simply requires you to think in a completely different way, and that throws a lot of people off.\n\nNow, you -can- play Dishonored as a hack and slash action RPGlite, if you want. However, you’ll unlock the bad ending that way, and you won’t get half of the achievements. If anything, the achievements, and ability to “Ghost” an entire level, is a callout to the Thief series.\n\nSo I played my first playthrough of Dishonored, as I would have played Thief, and I had a FANTASTIC time playing the game. That said, I probably wouldn’t play the game a second time through as a non-violent stealther, but I might give it a go, one day, as a rabid, swashbuckling mass-murderer. You know, for the bad end and all that.\n\nIf you were on the ledge about Dishonored, I can tell you this. Take the game without comparing it to other titles, and you’ll find a fairly fun, well-polished, and smooth game. Sure, there are the rare bugs, but in a gaming world where bugs are becoming more common place among shipped titles, they’re considerably rare. The game really only has three playthroughs in it for someone like me, who devours content and then moves on, but completionists might find a good two or three months of gameplay out of it. Considering the amount of time invested, compared to the money invested, any price tag under 20 dollars is a fair trade off these days.","December 27, 2014","true","18.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuckingLautrec/recommended/205100/","FuckingLautrec","Fucking Lautrec","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FuckingLautrec/","380 products in account","THE FOLLOWING CONTAINS MINOR SPOILERS\n\nIf it were about how much fun I had, this game would easily be the 9/10 that a lot of 'critics' seem to have awarded it. I absolutely loved the world of Dishonored, the washed-out watercoloury art style slotted in perfectly with the nice blend of Steampunk/Old England. I loved the clothing designs (including Corvo's mask of course), and the weapons were really cool in my opinion as well. Blinking from rooftop to alleyway, dashing around guards and taking out targets was an amazingly fun experience for me in Dishonored.\n\nBut despite all this I've said, looking at Dishonored from a critical standpoint reveals that it is honestly a mediocre game at best. An example of 'stealth done wrong', with basic elements like hiding bodies and using the environment to avoid combat encouraged only by the prospect of a 'good ending' and a couple achievements. The skill "trees" are what really make the game fall short. If you want to end the game not being treated like a blood thirsty merciless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ then you must choose to avoid about 70% of basically ♥♥♥♥ing everything. A whole bunch of skills are virtually useless and some even unusable if you want to keep your chaos (the Good/Neutral/Evil system that is really more like Good/Evil/Satan-Incarnate) low. Lets not forget that using any weapons other than your crossbow, with sleep darts only of course, are strictly off limits as well (minus the choking ability that didn't even have a default keybind on the PC version). Yes, that includes that cool rewiring tool that you can use to make the turrets and electric gates only affect the bad guys. Oh, and to top it all off the game has a huge difficulty flaw in terms of being able to cheese through a whole bunch of the levels if you've maxed out blink and agility.\n\nThe characters are pretty boring and one dimensional also, with clique traits following a clique storyline with *surprise* clique betrayals. The plot twists aren't even that much of a shock to player anyway, as we're barely given much of a chance to do anything with any of the characters we meet before we're shipped off to do another assassination. At least the non-lethal ways of taking out said targets are creative. The bad guys are all typical power hungry schemers or simply megalomaniacs, with the only one who has any bit of depth being Daud and possibly Havelock in the final scene. Corvo is a silent protagonist, not the kind that you can project yourself onto though however. Corvo has more than just a name, he has a backstory with possible love-related connections. You can't fit yourself entirely onto a canvas that's already half full, which has resulted in Convo simply being a really boring character where the only thing you have control over is if he decides to become a horrendous murderer and essentially doom everything by passing on his bad traits to the game's damsel: Princess Emily.\n\nDespite all I've just said, it'd probably be hard for you to believe that Dishonored is one of my favourite games. I just like playing it, despite its horrific flaws and awful characters/plot/mechanics I still find it enjoyable simply because this lame kinda genre appeals to me personally as the type of game I like jump into every now and again. I encourage you to play it for yourself before deciding on whether my judgements on the game are fair or not; I definitly recommend it for a quick playthrough if you're looking for something different yet not necessarily fresh.

You level up certain skills, your right hand is always a sword while your left is gun/powers/crossbow/etc.  You can rely on stealth of various methods or you can just go running in trying to blow stuff up.  The graphics are fine, the gameplay seemed pretty solid as in I didn't have any glitches.  I found the powers you get to be really fun to use and enhance the going stealth or not stealth (which ever you want).  Story is somewhat predictable, but that doesn't take away from the overall experience.  The game let's you go through on a no kill run.  There are alternatives for everything that needs to be done so a complete no kill run is possible.\n\nSo far I've completed it once and I went what woudl be considered the 'good' path.  I've already started a 'bad/dark' path to change things up.  Haven't made it to the DLC yet either but that will be after the dark path is finished.

It can also inspire disinterested folks to get into this genre.\n\ncons..\nHowever the gameplay style "can" get repetitive as the game closes to the end. The players "adjust" and things can look quite simple as he/she gains experience.\n\nSince this is a non multiplayer and currently a closed dev. game I'd say go torrent if you are wanting to be frugal.\nBut like I said above, it does deserve praise and worth the quality.\nConsider buying it if you want to respect the developers.","August 13, 2014","true","17.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It kept nagging at me though because I thought it was definitely a game I should like.  I gave in during the summer sale and and I’ll be honest; I hit a point at the very beginning where it still didn't grab me.  This time, I pushed through my frustration and it turns out, I love this game!\n\nI was totally caught up in the story and I really dug Korvo.  I was even caught a bit by surprise by the twists and turns that happen.  Hell, I even fell in love with the world of Dunwall and the side stories you find in all the books that you collect along the way.  The Outsiders powers are fun though I really only used Blink and The Ash powers, but they fit well with the combat they've built into the game.\n\nEarly on, it was the fact that they give you wide open maps and leave it up to you to figure out how to get get through them that overwhelmed me.

(probably in my top 30, but I've played alot of games)\n\nTL;DR If this is the game you'd normally play and it looks good, buy it, it's worth it.\n\n[MILD SPOILERS MIGHT BE AHEAD]\nThe Story\nSo it all begins with our silent protagonist named Corvo who is the bodyguard of the empress, he was on a mission to seek help from other cities, when he returned the empress was murdered right infront of him and her daughter, Emily kidnapped, Corvo found by the Royal Spymaster with the dead empress in his arms, is arrested and thrown in prison, his appending death awaits him - This is only the intro to the story, things get much more eventful and fun.\n\nThe Graphics\nThe textures are not the best, but they certainly aren't bad, deffinetly playable.\n\n\n\nThe sound track I have to admit I didn't listen to much, I was distracted by murdering hundreds of people without even being seen, though the voice acting is good.\n\nGameplay\nThere are ranged weapons, tools, and supernatrual powers.\n\nYou have a choice of plenty of different weapons depending on how you want to play, you can choose to play High Chaos or Low Chaos, if you kill lots of people you'll get High Chaos (per mission), if you don't kill over 3-5 people (per mission) you'll get Low Chaos, on HC you'll get more rats, more weepers, and it will influence Emily negativly, effectivly giving you the "bad end", on LC you'll get less rats, less weepers, and it will influence Emily positivly, effectivly giving you the "good end"\n\nIf you want to play HC, there are different tools and weapons ranging from your default sword to grenades, and even rewiring eletric devices made by the enemy and kill them with it, you can even summoun rat swarms to do the killing and rid of bodies for you.\n\nIf you want to play LW, there are different tools and weapons ranging from choking and knocking out enemies to sleep darts, possesing people without killing them, and even freezing time to walk straight infront of your enemy without them ever knowing.\n\n\nOver all\nStory is intreasting and eventful - 8/10\n\nGraphics are decent and get the job done - 5/10\n\nGameplay is fun and gives you plenty of different options to get the job done - 10/10\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of the genre!","August 20, 2015","true","59.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The graphics are fine, the gameplay seemed pretty solid as in I didn't have any glitches.  I found the powers you get to be really fun to use and enhance the going stealth or not stealth (which ever you want).

There are alternatives for everything that needs to be done so a complete no kill run is possible.\n\nSo far I've completed it once and I went what woudl be considered the 'good' path.

That game was greatly underrated. It had the RPG elements, stealth, great storyline, engaging narrative, great voice-acting, exploration, choice and a few of insane twists, orcs, demons, hot chicks, lust, the ability to kick, the ability to set off traps, alternate paths, dragons, mages, and a long single player campaign. I attempted to review that game on several occasions but failed every time. The game should just be played.\n\n\nThis game follows The Dark Messiah in its footsteps. The melee fighting is nailed once again (unlike in Skyrim). Your melee blows feel real, you can almost feel the weight of your blows and the damage to the enemies is realistic. You don't have to hit someone over the head with a mace ten times for them to die (ahem...Skyrim...ahem...). Overall, we get tight controls, responsive and properly ported mouse, the ability to peek left or right, the ability to climb obstacles. The movement of the character has been nailed perfectly. You move fast when moving forward and you move slow when moving sideways. I should say that it wouldn't hurt for this game to have the kicking ability just like in the Dark Messiah. There are certain instances where you can push the unaware enemies from ledges.\n\n\nAs far as the graphics go. Well, it's nice see a slightly cartoony-Rage-like rendition of the Unreal Engine 3.0, but seriously, why isn't this engine on life support yet? The textures are static, the trees do not move, the faces look like lifeless chunks of plastic. The water looks horrible but swimming under water looks and feels pretty realistic. The DX9 lighting is okaish. The artistic style however almost makes up for the old engine. I wish there were more graphic options to beef up the visuals. However, you can't see your legs and you cast no shadow. It's ironic that in some instances The Source Engine rendition in The Dark Messiah looks better than in this game (that's a 6 year difference).\n\n\nThe gameplay is where the game shines (especially the melee). The melee fights are as satisfying as ever although they don't last as long as in the Dark Messiah. You get to wield a melee weapon and a range weapon. There are plenty of upgrades that you get at your home base, as long as you have the coins and the proper blueprints. The stealth has been pulled off pretty well, which is further expanded with the ability to hid bodies. Although there's no indication if you are hidden or not so you have to rely on your instincts. You have a choice of knocking out or slaying your unaware foes but if things go sour you can easily dispatch them with your weapons too. That happens to be one of the few gripes I have with the game, even though some enemies get tougher later in the game. You also get to teleport which I think makes the game easier in oh so many ways. You also get to collect magic runes and put them towards your character development, (higher jump, more health, the ability to see in the dark, etc.)\n\n\nI won't spoil the story much. You play as a mute imperial bodyguard/turned assassin, Corvo, bent on restoring the imperial throne and avenging the conspirators in a dystopian alternate reality world. I don't know why FPS developers are having such a difficulty with adding voice to the main character, it kills the immersion. Anyways, you get to put the pieces together, discover what the world has to offer and seek for clues for how the rat plague started. It's also interesting to meet various characters. Each one of them offers something a different view on reality and the nature of society. You get to do secondary quests and backtrack throughout the world. Overall, the pacing of the game feels real.\n\nThere are moments when you don't have to fight enemies for a long time if you want the game to play life Thief. You also don't get to fight hordes of enemies although you are almost always in danger of being discovered. And even WHEN you are discovered you can quickly dispatch the enemies. I feel there should have been more danger and repercussions for being discovered. Although, if you play on hardest difficulty, it will only take a guard to slice you 3 times for you to die (maybe 5 with the health upgrade). You can also fight every enemy you see and clear the areas that way although you may run out of ammo quickly.\n\n\nOverall, this is a great game with many twists and epic moments although there is some slight imbalance as far as your super-powers go, otherwise, everything else has been nailed pretty well. Don't forget, this is a Single-Player only game, which is saying a lot these days.\n\nA LOT of love and effort went into this game.","November 27, 2013","true","23.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Everything was perfect ... almost. The story started off as pretty generic, but rather quickly turned very interesting. Also, a huge unexpected twist is what makes the story so amazing. The gameplay is great. The spells are awesome, the stealth is awesome, the combat is crap, the ... oh wait. The combat ... if you get stuck and aren't good at blocking. Just run, you WILL die. My other qualm with the gameplay is that if you wish to get the good ending, then half the skills are useless as they are detrimental to the goal of getting that ending. The graphics are awesome with a fairly unique style that I didn't expect in this sort of game, but it works very well and makes the world a lot more interesting. The sound is exactly what I expected from a stealth game.

And the game's most impressive feat is that all of these methods work equally well.\n\nThe story, though neither revolutionary nor unpredictable, still is entertaining, with nice bits of steampunk lore spread here and there, and some sidequests, which you are free to ignore if you just want to play.\nThere are also collectibles and treasures to find for those who like this kind of stuff, but it's still entirely facultative towards your progression.\n\nAll these elements show how much the game caters to everyone's taste, and it's why it can easily be recommended just for about anyone.\n\nThe multiple gameplay possibilities provide some replay value, which is a good thing since the game is not very long (11 hrs for a playthrough - and that's reading every book and searching for most collectibles).\n\nThe normal difficulty is slightly too easy: there are too many potions and ammo scattered everywhere to make it any challenging at all. For any person who likes a challenge I would recommend to do the first playthrough in hard, or to go for the no kills playthrough achievement.\n\nObjectives are permanently highlighted on the HUD which also makes the game easy, but you can switch them off in your option if you want to explore by yourself.\n\nI've had only two gripes with this game. Firstly all the unimportant pedestrians' faces are the same. Some variety would have been nice as it's a bit like walking in a clone world.\n\nFinally an annoying bug: the saved games don't seem to recall the enemy positions accurately so occasionally I have reloaded a save where I was in a stealthed position, only to find myself in the middle of enemies who would immediately discover me.\n\nThese inconveniences are of course very minor compared to the pleasure it was playing this game through.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/destroyingdrax/recommended/205100/","destroyingdrax","cassie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/destroyingdrax/","24 products in account","Dishonored is a first-person stealth action-adventure game set in the fictional plague ridden city of Dunwall. You play as Corvo Attano, body guard to the Empress and friend to her young daughter Emily. Framed for murder, you are forced to become an assassin and spend the majority of the game seeking those who wronged you.\n\nGameplay for a single campaign can last anywhere from 15 to 40 hours, depending on how you go about accomplishing your objectives.\n\nBecause of the games steam punk inspired art style the graphics still look great, despite it being almost four years old.\n\nThis game boasts a quality soundtrack, gameplay that can be tailored to a wide range of styles, good artistic direction and a compelling story, but my favorite aspect of Dishonored is what a big emphasis it puts on players choice.\n\nThe game allows you to complete each mission in a variety of ways. The more you explore your environment the more options become available to you. Because of this, how you chose to reach and accomplish objectives impacts the environment and the way the story progresses. You can do ‘low chaos’ or ‘high chaos’ runs - deciding to use stealth, weapons, or magic to move forward.\n\nCreating panic and leaving dead bodies spreads disease, increasing the number of rats and weepers roaming Dunwall city streets. Operating under stealth and choosing to spare people usually takes takes more effort, but will make the ending to your story a happier one. Making different choices vastly alters your environment and how NPCs react to you in the game, giving it good replay value.\n\nThe DLCs included in the GOTY addition are worth playing. They do a good job of continuing and complementing the story but are not necessary for it to feel complete, which is how downloadable content should be.","March 25","true","41.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

An interesting world is painted, but the details are obtained through the optional mid-mission, flow breaking reading of found diaries and letters. Pass. The gameplay and missions are quite engaging... stopping to read a wall of text about someone's cousin coming to visit is counter-productive. Feeling obligated to stop and read the final enemy's diary mid-climax is maddening.\n\nWith its score keeping system, Dishonored also attempts to steer you towards a strict non-lethal approach... granting intangible bonuses for not being seen or killing anyone. Which is a shame since it's at its best when you're able to use all the wonderful tools it gives you. When 9/10 of your options for getting through any given situation are lethal, feeling compelled to avoid them is cheating yourself out of gameplay. After a few levels, I decided to open up the playbook and feel free to kill when beneficial to the objective... and the game came alive. Dropping from a rooftop sword first onto a guard, shooting his friend, then countering and stabbing a 3rd before vanishing into the shadows is fun as hell. There is no non-lethal equivalent.\n\nLest you think I'm just bloodthirsty....\nThere's only one level, the Lady Boyle encounter, where the purely non-lethal approach is just as viable as the lethal ones... and it was my favorite segment. Everyone lived, though not everyone left happy :)\n\nPlay naturally. Embrace "high" chaos.

The graphics are wonderfully stylised, with a selection of interesting characters that aren't too out of the ordinary, but not bland enough to make you forget them. The protagonist in particular, Corvo, is wonderfully created, so you can imagine what kind of man he would be and play him to that image, whether he's the forgiving kind of killer or whether he just wants to see Dunwall burn. The story-line is intriguing and there's plenty of different turns you don't expect that I've enjoyed so far. Plus I love the man eating rats. The game has levels of customisation whether you want to use a gun, crossbow or the supernatural powers you're given early in the game, with plenty of collectbles to find each mission and requires a level of intelligence to find, as getting to them are sometimes puzzling. So far I simply adore this game and if you're a fan of Assassin's Creed, Thief and Bethesda's works, I can't recommend this game enough.","March 13, 2014","true","9.4"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Consider that Corvo can teleport, see through walls, posses creatures, stop time and effortlessly render any enemy permanently dead or unconscious.\n* The game drops a plot twist that doesn't go anywhere.

I’ve played the game through a few times and I enjoyed both stealth heavy and combat heavy playthroughs.  Additionally, the visual presentation, sound design, and music are all really well done and each made a good impression.\n\nComplementing the fun gameplay is some wonderful world building and storytelling.  Characters are believably flawed and nuanced, and I became invested in Corvo’s quest for revenge or redemption.  But stealing the show was the city of Dunwall.  Dunwall is a marvelous setting and I really liked the blend of steampunk, gothic, and Victorian elements.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/misspauling/recommended/205100/","misspauling","Cade","http://steamcommunity.com/id/misspauling/","586 products in account","A lot of things went through my mind while I played Dishonored. I'd read a lot of things about the game before its release, and I'd read a few reviews and opinions here and there after the fact, but by and large I knew little to nothing about the story besides the basics: you play as an assassin named Corvo; you have a plethora of interesting weapons and supernatural powers; and you're arrested, dishonored (lol) and almost executed for a crime you didn't commit.\n\nSo overall, my expectations were set at a middling level; I knew Harvey Smith, one of the designers of the original Deus Ex, was largely involved, but I worried that perhaps this wouldn't mean much, and I'd be funneled through corridors with little choice as to how events unfolded.\n\nBoy, was I wrong. Dishonored drops you in with some very basic in-game tutorials disguised as everyday routines, and it's a beautiful world. The characters seem alive, the landscapes are vast and interesting, and the music eases you into the experience.\n\nThen it all goes wrong, and the ride really begins. The pacing of Dishonored is superb; just when you think you've come to understand the basics of a level, the next level is something completely different. Whether it's infiltrating a high society party, escaping from plague victims and guards alike in broken-down buildings, or breaking into high-rise penthouses, the experience is always fresh and you're always given countless ways to achieve your objectives.\n\nAlong the way, you'll pick up Runes, which allow you to purchase and upgrade new powers (and I want to note that throughout my experience, there were a few powers I never played with; Runes aren't scarce, but you will have to budget them well), ranging from a simple powerup that makes the bodies of enemies you kill while unaware disappear to a (somewhat gloriously broken) power that stops time completely, allowing you to set up various murders and let them all happen simultaneously.\nYou'll also pick up Bone Charms, which have subtle effects on your gameplay such as slightly faster sword attacks or potions giving you more mana.\n\nEach location that you find yourself murdering or non-lethally choking or avoiding confrontation through is beautifully designed, and offers multiple paths to your objectives, including optional objectives that aren't always easy to find. Truly, this is as close to a modern day Deus Ex as we're likely to get anytime soon.\n\nThe story is interesting, full of twists and turns, and your actions play huge parts in how it all unfolds. It's touching at times and sickening at others, and it all feels very cohesive.\n\nI hesitate to call anything my GOTY without playing everything released in that year, so I'll just say that Dishonored is one of my Games of All Time. Much closer to Deus Ex than DX:Human Revolution, filled with creativity and choice.\n\nA masterpiece.\n\n","June 24, 2013","true","15.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/recommended/205100/","kryskiller666","BadassFreeman","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kryskiller666/","217 products in account","My opinion about this game is a mixed bag. There are a lot of things that this game makes incredible well, and then there are some others that suck balls beyond EA levels.\n\nFirst of all, the price. The hell is this. I don't know if they changed it recently, but this game has stayed with a price tag of 60€ for a year or two after it's release. Is the game long? No. The game has multiplayer? No. Coop? No. Does it deserve the 60€'s?\n\nF#CK NO. Personally, my brother picked up this game in a sale for me as a gift, for 3€, and I think that's what is worth for a semi-dull single-player experience. Yes, I said dull. Here's why.\n\nThe story, while it's quite interesting at first, there are points that get a bit boring, because it's usually the same thing over and over, even with some of those small maps re-used with little changes. And the story does have something worse, but that's still to come. So, what's up with the gameplay?\n\nIt's kind of flawed. You see, you're extremely over-powered. The enemies have NO DAMN CHANCE against you, because of either their massive brain damage, or bad programming. It's easy to beat them up with a handful of slashes with the sword, it's easy to execute them with a pistol, it's easy to screw them up with a crowssbow, it's HELL EASY to sneak up on them and cut their throats, and don't even get me started on the non-lethal methods. And that's the problem I was talking about before:\n\nThere are multiple endings, and there are tons of fun ways to annihilate those peasants the game tells you they're your enemies. But you know what? Killing people won't allow you to see the GOOD ending. And is it fun to sneak up on people and ocasionally knock down the few guards who won't let you go unseen? Frankly, no. I love stealth based games, like Deus Ex. And in Deus Ex HR, they did a good job with all of that crap. But in here? They kinda messed it up. Stealth is boring, combat is fun, yet repetitive, BUT YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING GOOD OUT OF IT, SO STAY IN THE SHADOWS AND GET BORED.\n\nThe game also has a few DLC's, but seriously, why should I give a crap about mission-packs, and why they expect me to pay for them? I do recommend this game, don't get me wrong. It's fun for a while. But you should not buy it at full price, unless you like wasting money. Calling this a stealth game is like calling modern CoD games GOOD. This is, rather, a weird hack-n-slash game, with some escort missions and stealth based gameplay. So, 3€ for this? Fine. 60€? F#ck off.\n\nAnd this thing better not get any sequels. I don't want to see Dishonored 2 for 70€ for the rest of my life.\n\nEDIT: F#ck my life, it's actually getting a sequel. I CALLED IT, I FORESAW THIS!","August 23, 2014","true","6.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/neonfx/recommended/205100/","neonfx","Neon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/neonfx/","695 products in account","Dishonored by Arkane Studios brought back the memories of classic PC games like Thief or Deus Ex, the constant need of exploring just one another room, reading just another little note, and then ending up playing for 10 hours straight. Games like these are a rarity in this day and age. This is not your average cookie-cutter first person shooter; I’d even dare to call it a first person stealth choose-your-own-adventure game. You can play it like an FPS. You can play it as a stealth game. You can play it as a mix of both. You can kill everyone in the room, or you can leave no trace behind. The choice is yours.\n\nYou control Corvo Attano, a personal bodyguard to the Empress of Dunwall, a fictional steampunk city based on London (though all the voice actors are American, which is a weird decision). About a minute into the game the Empress gets killed, her daughter gets kidnapped, and you get framed for the murder of Her Highness.  Exploring the beautifully crafted city is a great pleasure, although the actual situation in the city is far from lovely. Not only is the crime rampant, but the rat plague is killing citizens not by dozens or hundreds, but by thousands. During your playthrough, about half of Dunwall is already dead, as commented by the city guard. The moments in games when I think “wait, this is ♥♥♥♥ed up” are extremely rare. Seeing a wagon dropping dozens of dead bodies was one of those moments. The wagon appears again and again, throwing off bodies wrapped up in filthy bandages. It empties up and returns full again. The world of Dishonored is brutal, every character you encounter has his own agendas and reasons for acting the way he acts, and nothing is ever black or white.\n\nThe approach you take when blasting (stealthing?) through missions is entirely up to you, and you have a nice variety of supernatural powers at your disposal. Do you want to wreak havoc upon your enemies? You’re likely to invest in a Devouring Swarm ability, which creates a devouring swarm (sic) of rats that attack your enemy and then clean up by eating their body. Neat. Are you MGS or pre-2006 Splinter Cell fan? You’ll probably want to upgrade Dark Vision and Possession, one of the most useful tools when it comes to stealth playthrough. Each of the nine missions is designed as a sandbox. Theoretically you could go for an objective marker (which you can turn off, by the way) and finish Dishonored in about 5 hours. But if you want to do that, it’s not the game for you. There are multiple sidequests in each of the missions, and some of them will bring repercussions in the future. The game offers you a choice- do you want a free rune that lets you upgrade your character? OK, but you’re going to have to poison Dunwall’s distillery by the request of a crazy lady. Do you want to kill the real murderer of the Empress, or give him a message and only steal his pouch that he carries by his side? Regardless of your choice, it’s worth playing through the game a second time, just to see the different ways people react to you whether you slaughter everyone or leave unnoticed. By the way- even though you’re an assassin, you can finish the game without killing a single person. That’s right. In times when 3-hour-long corridor shooters earn numerous GOTY awards and critical acclaim, an offer of a choice like this is an excellent touch.\n\nSumming up, Dishonored is a game that begs to be played at least twice. No playthrough will be the same, whether because you choose to end a sidequest differently, upgrade your character in a different manner, or skipping some chunks of content by mistake, because you weren’t patient enough to listen to the guards’ conversation which unlocked a non-lethal way to accomplish your assignment. The over the top picturesque artistic design, fantastic supernatural abilities, excellent voice acting and music, and most importantly- the freedom to tackle the missions in dozens of different ways make this my game of the year.","November 25, 2013","true","38.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/recommended/205100/","Rhykevance","Sharisad","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rhykevance/","1008 products in account","Compareable to\n- Thief (stealthing based on gadgets and special powers)\n- Half-Life 2 (Dystopian elements: fighting a regime, propaganda streetspeakers, meeting suffering civilians along the way, an omnipresent and pressing threat - in this case a rat plague)\n- Hitman (you go on kill missions and have sort of a safehouse)\n\nIt's story-driven, but the story for most parts revolves around neutralizing key enemies scattered around the fictional (but highly "British"-looking) city of Dunwall. There is a kind of safehouse where you talk to allies and relax for a moment before entering hostile territories again. Your basic three approaches at all time are to stealth your way around, to knock out everyone or to kill all you see. You can finish the game without killing a single person or animal. There is one situation where I couldn't find a satisfying non-lethal way though and where I felt pressed to kill somebody. I will look at that again, maybe I missed how to do it the way I was hoping to.\n\nRather easy. I played on "hard" difficulty (there was "very hard" too I believe). Standard stealthing mechanics. You can take out guards one by one (kill or put to sleep), drag them into dark corners and by thus slowly empty the levels of all danger. You are invisible while leaning around corners. Your special powers make you see enemies through walls, stop time for a brief moment and teleport for some distances and on rooftops and things which makes things easy. A.I. isn't the smartest and only having basic abilities (patrolling areas, cone of vision, some awareness to noise). Guards you take out are eventually replaced by others, you will see more guards either patrolling the area you've been in previously after switching back and forth to other places (with a loading screen inbetween) or see "live" replacements coming from where you are meant to progress to. I noticed guards being replaced one time at best - after taking the replacement down the area would stay empty.\n\nCombat is somewhat underwhelming. Enemies step up to you and will either swing their swords or stand still, aim their flintlock pistols and shoot at you. You basically do three things then: Block with your own sword (one button, blocks all sword attacks, if timed well enough your enemies are stunned and vulnerable to instant-kill animations, sometimes you'll be kicked at which breaks your block), step sidewards when pistols are aimed at you (which makes enemies holster them again rather than adjust their aim) and spam your own attack button. Enemies evade or block a hit or two, or cross swords with you, but they don't keep this up for long, you kill them rather swiftly and even easier when using your special powers. Occassionally (in particular when attacking enemies previously stunned by timed blocks) you will see a specific animation in which your character grabs their arms or something before cutting their throat. It's not looking badly or anything, it just isn't very hard or challenging or anything, no one in this game stands a chance against your character.\n\nLooks nice and fitting overall. Some textures are blurry. But it ran like a charm, I had no performance issues, and it just generally felt like a very polished game. All special powers make sense and support either stealthy or loud approaches. There is quicksaving/-loading and loading times are practically nonexistent, this way you can do everything perfectly the way you want it to be or test out some of the freedom the game gives you.\n\nI just had that one issue when getting hurt or taking control of other creatures with my special powers the various effects that go along (blurry or colored screens) wouldn't disappear too easily. That wasn't too bad since I was stealthing mainly anyway. I noticed that enabling VSynch will make these effects fade out properly.\n\nOne thing that irritated me is that bodies of people you took down will just disappear. You knock out two or three guards, toss them in a trash bin or in some dark corner, come back a minute later and some of them will have simply vanished. Not sure was that was about. I was first trying to explain it with them being found by other patrols, but even when roaming nearby they would disappear, and when the game shows you your mission statistics these bodies never counted towards "bodies discovered".\n\nOne feature I liked a lot: There is a heart (half organical, half mechanical) you can hold in your hand and which will whisper secrets to you about the location you are in or about the persons you are aiming at with it. It's voice actress sounded nice, and the way her voice was "manipulated" (with some kind of echo resonating around multiple times) felt intriguing. Especially the various allied NPCs you meet over and over again in your safehouse are given some good depth that way, along with talking to them or listening to "audiographs" (short voice recordings) made by them. I was generally caring for the characters or curious about their intentions and doings, I thought they were all neatly crafted.\nAiming with the heart isn't always easy, often I heard location secrets even though I tried aiming at persons. Sadly, from the middle towards the end of the game you will keep meeting the familiar types of enemies or civilians and there is only one pool of lines for each type (and for each key character), so if you've exhausted all of them early on you won't be using the heart later on too much anymore except for key kill targets you meet for the first and only time.\n\nThe game seems to have multiple endings. A set of snipplets looking towards the future of things, and how these snipplets look like seems to depend on how much you stealth around or not causing chaos to the city (mission debriefs have a "chaos" indicator - if you kill many people it will tell you the chaos is "high", and in the next missions there are presumably supposed to be more "Weepers" (plague victims) or rats or stuff. I was having "low" chaos throughout most parts of the game so I wouldn't notice. Guards, streetspeakers and other NPCs will make remarks in some instances on how brutally or peacefully you'll have advanced through the game.\n\nThe game ends fairly solid though some questions are left unanswered. There is some DLC available. Not sure if those answer some of my questions. Bethesda is apparently planning of turning this game into a franchise. There is some lore background allowing to do more. There are various fictional continents, they designed a world map you can glance at several times ingame, there are texts and voice recordings giving insight into the characters, industry, politics and myths of the world circling noteably around whaling business and a world being seemingly in some kind of industrial revolution.","August 5, 2014","true","83.7"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

There is a Technocracy which suffers some political drama at the start of the game that the player has to advance from.\n\nThe controls are simple and yet there are so many options for play and movement. I did get stuck in two places in the game where my avatar could not move and I had to load from autosave. I felt that something I shouldn't have happen in an AAA game. However, the game is so incredible in every other way that I just overload it!\n\nI highly recommend this game and it's one of the few games where I play it from start to finish. I may even play it again, which is something I don't think I've done for ANY GAME EVER!","May 21, 2014","true","24.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","4"

It nails first person platforming very well.\n\nThere's a lot of choice in this game, there are many different play styles and an impressive amount of diffrent routes to tackle a mission. It definitely encourages multiple playthroughs.\n\nA few downsides are the fact story is pretty meh (you were betrayed, you must take revenge, you must save a little girl, blah blah) it's been done quite a bit.\n\nAlso upgraded Blink makes the game FAR too easy, you can honestly miss out on alot of Dishonored's content just by blinking across rooftops. Even if you don't do that, if you're a veteran of the stealth genre, you'll find this game not that challenging in general.\n\nBut the way it fluidly mashes stealth and platforming more then makes up for it, it's quite the blast to play. Apparently the DLC is pretty good as well.\n","June 14, 2014","true","68.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you haven't played it yet and you love games with alternate play styles, engaging storylines and RP choices that have actual impacts on your playthrough, then you're missing out. Keep in mind I may be biased as I normally love any kind of dark, gritty story that takes place in a dystopian society... However trust me when I say that this game is absolutely brilliant! I loved how it was acceptable for me to progress through quests with a clear objective, then to decide halfway through that I did not agree with it and do something completely different to make the ends meet.\n\nI was not led by hand through the game, I was allowed to play as I saw fit; It could be anything from scaling the chandeliers of a house to protecting a local thug from a crazy old bat. With every playthrough I discover something new, characters reacting to me in a different manner, new opportunities, stumbling upon side-characters I've never met before because I chose a different route and so on.\n\nHowever I do have a wee bit of nitpicking, very insignificant though I might add. I would've appreciated a short prologue in which I was allowed to get to know the Empress and Emily, I found myself not caring much for them, Emily did grow on me though as I got to interact with her. I also would've have liked more side quests that aren't DLCs, while it was refreshing that there were few, I also felt that they were so well made that I sort of wanted more...\n\nTL;DR - 10/10","May 26, 2014","true","26.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The pacing of game machanics alone are realistic, introducing themes and world aspects as the story changes and shifts.\n1. Atmospheric: Felt at the level of the first Bioshock, or even Portal 2. I think that's all I need to say.\n2. Well written: Good story and pacing. I found a few secrets before they were meant to be revealed, and some secrets I didn't figure out till the closing chapter of the game. But I like that not all is revealed to you, that you have to think about it to figure something out, or it's there to be found if you go exploring in the world. Story told through gameplay and your own intuition.\n3. Fun gameplay: The first time I killed someone I said "What even are hit boxes?". And that wasn't fair at all to how this game plays. You are either spotted or sneaking past. And the ways they allow you to sneak past makes this one of the best game play experiences I've ever had.

There's loads of them and they make you do things in the game you wouldn't normally think about. Adds a layer of depth.\n3. Stealth versus lethal. And the combination of weapons and powers. Being able to play the game as you want to in your own style and not be penalised for it, instead it simply changes the story slightly.

It is fairly good, but who wouldn't expect that from the same guys who made Arx Fatalis?\n\nThe story is compelling. I'll try and spell this out for you while forgoing the spoilers.\nYou're Corvo, an agent and bodyguard of the Empress, but something terrible happens and you're to blame, stripped of all honorable titles. You must, with the help of some friends, stealthily take down or kill your way through the people who've set you up as the fall guy.\n\nThe gameplay is simple and probably deceptively so.\nBasically, you're given the an objective, such as, "Get from point A to point B and eliminate this target." You'll encounter enemies along the way and you will have to decided to either kill them, eliminate them non-leathally or just sneak past.\nTo aid you in your quests you're given tools of magically fast loading flintlock pistols and crossbows, a sword and some special abilities. These special abilities will help you either sneak or kill. The most important is probably "blink." It's sort of like a teleport, but it's not instantaneous and enemies can see you if you blink in front of them. You can also stop time, possess people and animals, the obligatory "reveal all enemies and obsticles for a short period of time" stealth game ability and some other cool stuff.\n\nThe soundwork is pretty good. Nice, crunchy dissonant orchestral work juxtaposed with some beautiful stuff. My only complaint is that there was one point where there were some fireworks and the sound actually clipped. I hadn't experienced that in a AAA title for... in recent memory. It's not that big of a deal though.\n\nThe level design is great, as it should be. Stealth games rely on good level design and this one doesn't pull any punches. Almost every enemy encounter is a puzzle in itself with more than a few solutions =)\n\nAll in all, I'd say I'm pretty happy with Dishonored. I haven't played the DLC, but I'll get into that later.","January 7, 2015","true","13.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dishonored is an amazing game with an very good and described storyline. Everything you do in Dishonored have an sometime small change in the story, but can also make a very big change to story. When you play the game through you will feel like Corvo Attano (Main person) as you really was him, not just as games where you dont get that special feeling, you will really get into the game and get a bigger understanding in feelings throughout the story, since the game is based on personal things as Revenge,Saving and Silence, you will have choices that throughout the story, you get many options based on revenge, or be a kind person so all your feelings are in this game wether you choose to be the ultimate sneaking assasin lurking in the shadows of Dunwall, or you want to be the mass murder that is feared in every cornor of the city.\n\nGameplay: I really like the combat technics thats been designed for the game, like you can shoot the head of a man with an arrow, or drop kill him from above when he less suspects, but I would like it a little more detailed as when you kill somebody the body still seems like he alive I think its a little unrealistic but i can live with it. The storyline in the game is also very good I like how they have made the game change the story a little when you can do some tasks for people and so on. The game is very detailed and have a very big storyline if you do all the sidestorys around when you have the possibility, and throughout all the fighting and talking in Dishonored you do even have books an notes all around the game that tells interesting stories of Dunwall city and if you play the game through you can even find easter eggs of some of the stories written in the books.\n\nHmm of 1/10 I will give this game a sure 10/10 since the only things that are missing is very small and not necessary, but i would like a Dishonored 2 or something even though it nearly seams inpossible to make a game as good and you can not make a succesor to the storyline that would match.","July 17, 2014","true","155.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can, however, go through the entire game without firing a single shot nor murdering anyone, which is neat ( and challenging ). At the end of the day, sneaking around is nowhere near as entertaining as using all of your powers and weapons and even simply using your sword to duel guards is more fun than sneaking.\n\nThe plot is quite intriguing but it abuses collectable books to explain it properly which may not be of your liking, considering you want to play a video game and not read a book.\nThe story progression itself offers a nice sense of replayability and the way your perception of a level changes whether you decide to use stealth or go guns blazing just makes replaying it all the more enticing.\n\nThe setting is superb ( seriously, the obsession with whales and the lore are a very interesting read ) and the graphic style is quite pleasing and refreshing, definetely not something you see every day.\n\nThe two story-based DLCs improve completely with regards to the level design and some of the mechanics of the game and it explains another side of the main story, definitely worth picking up. The rest of the DLCs are not as great but if you end up loving the game and you want time trials and things like that, it is okay.\n\nThat being said, it is not a long game, very replayable if you like it a lot but also very short if you do not. You could probably finish it in about 8 hours or less if you go for the main objectives and ignore exploring the levels and doing all the side quests.","December 27, 2014","true","44.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's one of my favourite games I've ever played. Proper dark and steam-punky, the atmosphere is gorgeously gloomy and filthy. Combine your magical powers with your deadly weapons to kill or slip past unnoticed, following a good story, this game should have all you'd want in a stealth game.","January 11, 2013","true","80.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Dishonored is an amazing game with an very good and described storyline. Everything you do in Dishonored have an sometime small change in the story, but can also make a very big change to story. When you play the game through you will feel like Corvo Attano (Main person) as you really was him, not just as games where you dont get that special feeling, you will really get into the game and get a bigger understanding in feelings throughout the story, since the game is based on personal things as Revenge,Saving and Silence, you will have choices that throughout the story, you get many options based on revenge, or be a kind person so all your feelings are in this game wether you choose to be the ultimate sneaking assasin lurking in the shadows of Dunwall, or you want to be the mass murder that is feared in every cornor of the city.\n\nGameplay: I really like the combat technics thats been designed for the game, like you can shoot the head of a man with an arrow, or drop kill him from above when he less suspects, but I would like it a little more detailed as when you kill somebody the body still seems like he alive I think its a little unrealistic but i can live with it. The storyline in the game is also very good I like how they have made the game change the story a little when you can do some tasks for people and so on. The game is very detailed and have a very big storyline if you do all the sidestorys around when you have the possibility, and throughout all the fighting and talking in Dishonored you do even have books an notes all around the game that tells interesting stories of Dunwall city and if you play the game through you can even find easter eggs of some of the stories written in the books.\n\nHmm of 1/10 I will give this game a sure 10/10 since the only things that are missing is very small and not necessary, but i would like a Dishonored 2 or something even though it nearly seams inpossible to make a game as good and you can not make a succesor to the storyline that would match.","July 17, 2014","true","155.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It leads you into the game and its various skills quite gently, so at no point do you feel like you have to remember what everything does or how to use it (i'm looking at you Witcher 2!!!) and before you know it, you're knocking people off, creeping about an being generally, a damn skillful deviant. Story line is pretty cool, as difficult as you want to make it. An it looks ace. Great steampunk aesthetic goin on... I'm def gonna run (creep) through it again on max difficulty and try not to get noticed his time. i went into it as a bit of a clumsy hack an slasher on my first run through but i sense the game is deeper than that... Worth  the dosh for sure but if it comes up on sale, bang it in the can like pronto cos its a def keeper!","April 4, 2014","true","36.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
