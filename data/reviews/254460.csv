This game utilises "fixed camera angles" like  the classic Resident Evil and Silent Hill games but mixes it up with a cheesy high school teen slasher flick story, and combining gameplay from both franchises. This survival horror has alot of the classic elements you would expect; variety of actual puzzles, limited supplies, dark and tense atmosphere, unique monster designs and since this is a co-op experience, reliability on your partner.\n\nSpeaking of partners each different character you can play as, and switch to at any time, have their own special abilities - so it is advisable to use different characters in the appropriate situation, I think this adds depth to the gameplay.\n\nThe story is cheesy, not serious, but there is a charm to it. It also features my favourite "game fetish" storyline in which everything is normal at first, but slowly devulges into the horror you came to expect, and you have to fight and learn the mystery behind how this all happened.\n\nThe combat is basic, there is auto-lock, power attacks and standard attacks, but that's all this game needs I feel. The good thing is that the controls are easy to learn and complexity is not needed here.\n\nUnfortunately, for me, the music is quickly forgettable so don't expect some Akira Yamaoka level of quality here. That being said, what I hear fits what is happening, just that it isn't something you would listen to casually.\n\nI recommend this game to fans of the classic RE and SH games, and looking for their fix on survival horror with some original concepts to it. However, this game was originially released back in 2005, so expect some outdated mechanics compared to modern horror.\n\nAlso, this PC port is a re-release of an older port but adds native widescreen support and full controller support, among general optimisations to work on modern Windows systems. The only bummer is that there is still no mouse support. I should also mention the game does indeed run at 60fps.","March 10, 2014","true","6.1"," 211 of 225 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","211","225","0","3"

The game feels good in that way because it brings extra life to the game rather than thinking you are playing as a lonely character. Each character has a special ability which will make progressing through the game easier if you don't let them get killed.\n\nStan by far is the best character. His personality is just too carefree and cool. :P\n\nBut if you want to have real fun, invite a friend over and grab an extra controller for 2 player Co-op playing out the story of the game. It is a lot of fun! You can even share items and weapons, passing them to each other when needed.\n\nA couple of downsides are that the game hasn't been updated to support wide screen monitors, so you will have a 4:3 aspect ratio unless you lower the res to 1600x1200, 1280x1024, 1152x864 or lower to get a full screen without side borders. Also, use of a controller is highly recommended as the game really wasn't optimized for mouse and keyboard.\n\nObscure is a great game though and yet another surprise to appear on Steam. :)","March 10, 2014","true","11.9"," 84 of 89 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","84","89","0","2"

Was quite surprised to see it on Steam. It's one of the games which reserved a spot in my memory. I remember having a lot of fun playing it, and i got the same pleasure replaying it after 10 years.\n\nObscure is an old-school horror survival game which manages to entertain by offering a cheesy story, influenced by the Robert Rodriguez's  "The Faculty" movie. It uses the music from the movie and even contains a character based on it. Even though i heavily disliked the movie, Obscure succeeded in offering me a whole different perspective.\n\nYou have 5 students trying to escape their school, from an entire horde of monsters created by their Principal who was experimenting on students. You can choose to play for any of them, and at any time a second player can join the game for any other character, which doesn't force you to start a new game if you want to play local co-op with a friend. Each one of them has a different special ability like running faster, better healing, or picking locks skills. I loved especially the method of saving the game. You do it using a CD which you need to find in-game, and i consider it to be an important aspect in a survival game, so that one won't be able to save every 2 minutes since the amount of CD's you can find is limited. The outstanding soundtrack composed by Olivier Derivière, in this particular environment, creates a even creepier atmosphere. There are few types of monsters, and also limited types of weapons, but what makes it better is that except weapons there is something else that hurts monsters - light. So when you are in a room with windows, and got yourself cornered - you can always break some windows and let them know who the boss is, as for the rooms with no windows - one can combine any firearm with a flashlight. I didn't notice for the light of the flashlight to inflict any damage, but at least it keeps the monster at distance for a short period of time.\n\nThere are also some cons of course, but none which caused me any inconvenience. You can choose a resolution up to 1920x1080 but the game does not support widescreen so you'll just get a 4:3 aspect with black borders on the right and left side. Playing it with keyboard & mouse is possible, but not entirely comfortably. At least i couldn't do it, so i just used  a Xbox 360 controller which worked just great. Graphics are not the best, but also not awful, especially for a 10 years old game. I enjoyed Obscure very much, and would recommend it to anyone who likes old school survival games. Looking forward to play the second game. Hope i'll enjoy it as much as the first. Cheers ;)\n\n* NOTE > The game also includes all the Deluxe Edition content: Soundtrack, Artwork, Screenshots, Sketches...","November 3, 2014","true","20.8"," 83 of 88 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","83","88","0","2"

If however, like my unfortunate self, you are incurably addicted to games which remind you of that first-ever magical experience of playing the original Resident Evil on the Playstation 1, and have been seeking to recreate the unprecedented terror and freshness of that experience ever since, then you could do much, much worse than this particular game, 'cause for better or for worse, it's still one of the better Resident Evil rip-offs around.\n\nObscure certainly owes an extraordinary amount to the first two Residents.  The high school it's set in looks a little uncannily like a spooky mansion at times, and heck, there's even a large emphasis on sinister plants and underground labs and what-not.  Add the flashlights from the Silent Hill games, and the monsters-who-are-adversely-affected-by-the-light elements from Alone In The Dark: A New Nightmare (another oldie, but goodie), and you pretty much have this game.  But really, if you're the kind of person I described at the end of the last paragraph, this ain't exactly gonna be something you'll complain about, right?\n\nI somehow never got around to this one when it was on the Playstation 2 - the high school setting somehow didn't inspire me at the time - but I'm glad to say I was wrong to abstain for so long.  Not "classic" exactly...but certainly respectable enough to be a must-play for the likes of yours truly.  Sure, it's nothing to write home about (unless your mother is also a fan of such games), but also not something for the horror-faithful to pass up, especially on sale.  I personally bought it at full price, and even then didn't feel ripped-off.  It's about the length it should be (i.e. mercifully shorter than the otherwise superior Dead Spaces), about as difficult as it should be (i.e. not overly so, with the possible exception of a slightly questionable save system and a truly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ final boss fight), has all the expected weapons (well, for an AMERICAN high school campus, anyway), and an actually pretty darn excellent soundtrack (which comes free in a separate folder with the game).  Hell, the AI for the single-player version (wherein you babysit a fellow high-schooler/"partner", who you can switch to at any time) isn't even that bad, as these things go...sure the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s get in the way occasionally, but only about 20% of the time, which is pretty acceptable all things considered.\n\nIn short, not too shabby at all.  Not terribly scary for a game of this type, with a story as poorly-constructed and real-world illogical as you would expect, and the characters make those in Friday the 13th movies look positively layered by comparison (the distinct "special skills" of the characters is certainly a nice touch, but do we honestly need the guy who runs slightly faster than everyone else, or the guy who picks locks slightly faster than everyone else?)...but lower your expectations suitably, and you just might be pleasantly surprised.  I certainly was, and look forward to playing the sequel.\n\nVerdict: 8.5/10.","May 24, 2014","true","12.9"," 48 of 52 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","48","52","0","0"

There's more to it than that, but that's the basic gist of things. Each of the high school students have their own special abilities, ranging from stronger attacks, the ability to sprint, and instant lock picking certain doors and lockers. If during the game you get one of the high school students killed, then they shall remain dead throughout the course of the game and the ending will change accordingly.\n\nCombat is a little sluggish, you'll often find yourself mashing the attack/shoot button in the direction of your enemy until they fall down. There's not a whole lot of depth to it, but some enemies will require a little pre-thinking strategy before going against. Ammo is also scarce, so you can't use your guns on everything you see either. The weapon management in this game is very simple, yet effective. For example, shining your flashlight on a monster will weaken it, and if you manage to find some tape, you can tape your flashlight onto a gun so you can use them at the same time. You can get better flashlights than others so you have to be careful on what you want to use your tape on. Nothing ground breaking, but a nice touch of item management none the less. You can also find healing items that will restore lost health. Again, healing items are scarce, so don't go tanking too many hits with the same character. The game does have simple puzzles, but nothing that you need to spend too long thinking about.\n\nWhere this game really shines though, is in the coop mode. Sadly it's only local coop, but nearly the whole game can be played with a friend (besides the tutorial at the start). Item management between players is very self explanatory, and everything can be shared between players. The camera is shared between the players, meaning no split screen and it'll only focus one player. However you can alternate who you want the camera to follow at any time, and a lot of the camera angles complement the idea of two players so it isn't that much of an issue.\n\nAll in all, this game is pretty much a lower quality version of the older resident evil games. It's not very scary, the combat is okay at best and the game isn't too long either. However the coop aspect in my opinion makes all of it worth it, so if you have a friend you can play this with, then buy away!\n\nIf you're interested in looking at the game, my friend and I have just started a let's play of this steam version on our channel. I'll just leave a link here in case you want to check it out:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99zsewBeVX4&list=UUP3JZEwTaJQzm0CyXKjDeYA\n","March 10, 2014","true","2.0"," 45 of 50 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","45","50","0","0"

And I have to say that   Obscure  is one of the best co-op experiences I've ever had. The nature of the game makes playing together necessary or rather playing "solo" impossible.\n\nBut let's start at the beginning and look at the different parts of the game:\n- The story: It is interesting enough to pay attention but don't expect too much from a survival horror game. The premise is that your friend Kenny vanished on the school grounds so his friends decide to stay after school and to search for him.\n\n- The gameplay: You have 4 or 5 characters you can choose from each with their own hitpoints (so you can change at the actual meeting place if one is hurt too much) and their own little special ability. For example Josh can tell if there is still something in the room for you to pick up which is actually helpful. Also the characters can die and you can keep playing the game till all of them are dead.\nThe camera angles are "dynamically fixed" (comparable to Resident Evil: Code Veronica X if you know that game) which means you will see the area always from the same direction but it will move with you to a certain degree. Also the camera is fixed on player one. This means in co-op the second player can go off screen and die there pretty easily. So you need to stay together. Other than that you have the Resident Evil room like system meaning that most time ennemies will not follow you in another room (there are small exceptions).\nThe ammonition is scarce (on normal there is more than enough). The same goes for the healing items and the discs needed to save (yes you can save everywhere as long as you have the disc item but each save will waste one of them). There are also melee weapons which help to save ammo on different ennemies.\nThe fighting itself is normal but has an interesting additional mechanic: the use of light. You can use your flashlight to make the ennemies "weaker" as they have some kind of creep protecting them which is sensitive to light. But while you use the flashlight power mode you can't shoot so you have to make a decision which gives a tiny little small amount of tactics. Other than that you have different type of weapons and ammo.\n\n- The soundtrack: It creates the necessary atmosphere for the game and I liked it a lot. A small grain of salt for players who owned the PS version. The intro song has been changed. You can look up the old intro and the song was definetely better but the license expired. It is not the end of the world.\n\n- Replayability: After completing the game there is a hard mode and you get alternate costumes. And the hard mode in this one is actually really hard. Ammo is divided by atleast two, some weapons are obtained only later on, discs are halved as well and healing items are cut to a fourth I had the feeling and yes, monster do make more damage. With the AI this mode can probably end pretty bad. Also completing the Hard mode is necessary for you achievement completionists. With a good partner you can get all achievements in around 10 hours.\n\nWell I don't know what to say more. If you like survival horror games like Resident Evil 1 - Code Veronica X and you are searching for really good local co-op experience then you should definetely get this one (although some may think it is a bit expensive for its age, I got it for the full price and did not regret the purchase).\n\nPS: If you have questions just ask. I'll try to answer them as fast as possible.\nPPS: It's a shame that I never got the chance to play Resident Evil Outbreak Multiplayer Mode (or even the single player mode since it didn't sound as much as fun as playing with others).","April 4, 2015","true","9.5"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","31","36","0","2"

It was one of my favorite games back then for some reason, and even after all these years, I still enjoy it a lot.\n\nObscure is a third person survival horror game, and a pretty decent one. It's not the scariest game I've ever played, and it's not even close, but it's quite enjoyable on it's own level.\n\nYou get trapped inside of a school at night while you are looking for a missing friend. But "Evil" stuff roams the grounds, and it's up to you to survive.\n\nIn this game, you can weaken your shadow coated enemies using your flashlight, and then they will be rather weak, kinda like Alan Wake, but years before it. There are 5 playable characters, and if any of them dies during your game, he or she stays dead for good. In easy or normal mode, the game is rather easy, and even if you kill every enemy in your way, you'll still have lots of ammo. BUT, when you play on hard mode, it's got that good ol' survival horror feel, where you are actually trying to survive. You've got WAY less bullets than the enemies you'll encounter, and health items are rather scarce, too. It's hard, but not overly hard, it's still quite enjoyable, judging when and where you should use your healing items or ammo.\n\nI didn't had any trouble with this port, aside from the incredibly awkward (before you get used to) keyboard controllers. (Yes, you can change 'em, and yes, it supports a controller, but I was way too lazy to change the inputs).\n\nThe graphics, even for a 2005 game, are pretty decent. The cutscenes are rather weird looking, but during the gamplay, they are enjoyable. The music of this game is also pretty good, even if there's only like 3 songs with countless remixes and stuff. (Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it)\n\nThe only downside about this game is, that even on hard difficulty, it's a pretty short game. You can finish it in less than 2 hours if you know where you're going, hell, perhaps even faster. I started a run on hard/special mode, and managed to go through the whole game in an hour and half.\n\nIt's definitely worth it, I would recommend this one if you are into old horror games. One thing, though....This game lacks the Sum 41 intro that made the old version kick ♥♥♥. That made me sad...9/10.","September 3, 2015","true","7.8"," 21 of 23 people (91%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","91","21","23","2","5"

All Choir-like and ♥♥♥♥. Which is spooky.\nThe fact once one of your five characters die, they stay dead is great too. And you can't really combat it with saving every 3 seconds either, as the saves are pretty limited. Though even with that, it's not hard at all to have all characters survive until the end.\nThe game is still in 4:3 ratio though, so if you're autistic enough to care about two black bars at the side of your screen, that'll annoy you. But other than that, the graphics are good (for their time) and the areas have a very creepy feel to them. Mix that with the perma-death, and you find yourself fearing for your life at times.\nThe story itself is a bit dumb, there's no arguing that, but it's very similar to an old cheesy horror movie, and the plot itself is pretty far-fetched, none the less, still easy to enjoy.\nThe game doesn't hold your hand very much throughout it, which is good, though at times it's pretty easy to get lost at certain parts of the map.\nI've played with both a Keyboard and Gamepad, if you have a gamepad, use it. It just makes everything ser much easier.\nIt's also 90s as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nWould recommend tho, I wrote a whole review on it, and I'm lazy as ♥♥♥♥.

Yes if you are into nostalgia or the rare occasion where you may be just morbidly curious. I, myself, fall victim to the latter and here's why...\n\nI played ObsCure 2: The Aftermath on the Wii (which I won't delve TOO much into, see that review later) and thought of it to be a torn fabric of the 1990's horror fame. It was goofy, had that post-grunge rock soundtrack and absurd college stereotypes as your choices for characters. However, I've been familiar with its predecessor for some time. Even having fellow comrades assure me that the original is better, especially if you are into those Resident Evil-esque games (Eternal Darkness, Evil Dead: Hail to the King). That didn't really solidify what I thought constitutes as a "good game", however I still had to know.\n\nNow for the meat and potatoes, is the game good? It is for what it is, I guess you could say. The game was made in 2004 and made by a company that I honestly never really even heard of. I had fun playing it, I was digging it. I enjoyed the experience as a whole. Despite my enjoyment, the game is really easy to beat. A speed run could go for a rough estimate of four hours, but that's an estimate. I'm sure there is somebody who nailed under an hour. I myself took about seven hours, but that doesn't really mean much.\n\nThe real show stealer would be the game's soundtrack and sound effects which really help set the tone and mood of the game. The music is sort of reminiscent to horror films like Rosemary's Baby or The Omen. And the sound effects make you feel like you’re not alone in dark and gloomy areas of the school. For what it's worth, the game's music and sound developers succeed in what they were going for.\n\nBut... like older games... the voice acting. If anything, this would probably resemble best to what my friends were referring to as "Resident Evil-esque". <----This feels like a dirty word, really.\n\nIn lieu of it all, this game is not bad. I'll probably play it again. It's not great, and it's certainly not ♥♥♥♥. But if you decide to get this, the REAL question to ask yourself is, "Do I buy just ObsCure or the ObsCure Collection?" As far as that goes, the ball is in your court.","March 30, 2014","true","7.3"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Splain/recommended/254460/","Splain","Splain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Splain/","85 products in account","Rated 6.5/10\n\nObscure is a multiplayer (local only) survival horror game. The game takes place at Leafmore High where 4 students go in search of one of their friends who went missing on campus. During the search they discover that the school is hiding many mysterious that could be directly tied to their friends dissapearance. It has been said that this game takes inspiration from the late 90s flick "The Faculty". After completing the game I am convinced this is true.\n\nThe game plays much like what you would expect from a traditional survival horror game. You will explore the campus in search of keys and levers to gain access to new areas all while discovering readable documents to fill you in on plot details. You may also be rewarded for exploring by discovering ammunition, healing items or even CD's which you can use to save the game. The CD's work very similar to Resident Evil's ink ribbons except that you can save at any time as long as you have a CD in your inventory. There are also a fair share of puzzles to solve, most of which prove fairly simple.\n\nOne of Obscure's strong points comes from it's combat. The combat in general is pretty basic, you can shine your light on enemies to hold them at bay while firing away with your guns, however if you pay attention to your surroundings you can often use the environment to your advantage. (Just remember the enemies are weakened by light).\n\nOne of Obscure's weakpoints comes from the AI. Again the game does have a local coop option and it is obvious that is how the game was meant to be played. Playing through on single player you will control 2 characters at a time. You will be in direct control of 1 and the other will be controlled by AI, however you can swap back and fourth between these two characters with the press of a button. Don't get me wrong, the AI knows how to dish out damage. Where they fall short is in their ability to avoid damage and once your AI dies, they are dead. Gone for the rest of the game and will never respawn. If you are playing single player, make sure to your AI does not have a bat for a weapon or they will die. Stick them with a pistol and keep them away from certain enemy types and you should manage just fine.\n\nObscure was indeed a fun playthrough once you learn how to work with the AI. The exploring is satisfying and the atmosphere is just creepy enough to keep you on edge. The game is relatively short and you can expect to finish in around 5 hours. If you are a fan of the older Resident Evil styled horror games you will enjoy Obscure. I recommend the energy drinks.\n\n","April 8, 2015","true","6.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I remember this being on the PS2 but i never tried it before. All i remember saying is it's like resident evil and silent hill. Well those people were right, and at the same time i think that this game is actually more fun than silent hill and above par with resident evil code veronica; considering that they both came out about a year or two apart.\nHere is my list of pro's and con's:\nPros:\n+PANTIES (in some places if your going up stairs and open a door you can see the girl with the short shorts panties (can't remember her name at the moment)\n+Great soundtrack\n+Nice graphics for its time\n+Smooth controls (unlike RE code veronica and Outbreak)\n+Gives you plenty of ammunition\n+The party system. i absolutely loved this about Obscure. I liked having two people and being able to control them and customize and give them shotguns, pistols, even a laser gun(very useful)\n+Nice replayability since you unlock a lot of stuff if you beat it on normal (i suggest beating on normal since if you don't you probably won't unlock anything on easy)\n\nCons:\n+I can only think of two cons. One is sometimes the camera angles will fall to your advantage.\n+And two the dreaded hallway of falling, which makes it hard not to fall because your partner can be a dumbass sometimes (you'll know it when you get to it)","March 17, 2014","true","6.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

Some of the criitics were far too picky with this game, such as lowering the score due to the bad grapics. The graphics aren't that bad for a 2004 game, graphics don't make the game; gameplay does. This game definitely delivers in gameplay; the local multiplayer is very well done and makes this game loads of fun playing it with someone right next to you instead of over a mic. I wish there were more games with this king of local multiplayer. My only complaints about this game would be that the dialouge can be a bit cheesy at times and its pretty difficult at times, not impossible though.

Each character has a different skill set that helps you progress through different areas in a more player friendly style of way.  The setting is very cool, very eerie as you complete your mission at the school.  The game is scary,  its unique and different, It has a very good soundtrack and a simple but fun story line.  It does have replay value, a special edition version, which is a very cool basic directors cut version of the game.

A fair 3/5: nothing bad, but nothing that you'd gush about to your friends either.\n\n\nLong version: Obscure draws a lot on the original Resident Evil games. Limited supplies, fixed camera angles (which I never had a problem with but other people hate), and puzzles that are for the most part very logical with only one emblem-style lock.\n\nThere is also the partner system. In this game you play as part of a duo of characters, selected from a pool of 5. On a PC, I think you can play local coop but it requires player 2 to use a PC controller or somehow hook up a second keyboard. The different characters have different abilities which are all handy and none are essential enough that you feel bad for not taking them (though since Josh can tell you if there are any pickups left in a room, you may feel paranoid without him).\n\nWhen playing solo, you can switch which partner you control with the F key, and the AI is rather good about not being an idiot and I've never had a particular issue with it. Combat is solid with an excellent auto-lock system, just keep an eye on your ammo.\n\nThe characters are drawn on basic high school stereotypes but none of it is as intolerable as some other reviews may make it appear. The voice acting and dialogue is both unimpressive but also lacking any memorable cheesiness along the lines of "Master of Unlocking" or "Jill Sandwich".\n\nHaving said that, the voices may be bland but OH MY GOD THE MUSIC IS AMAZING! It's very good and a great mood-setter.\n","May 29, 2014","true","4.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Obscure is doing this 100%, the plot isn't there to tell a story, the plot is there to force characters into situations where they must fight monsters. By the way, the characters are basic high-school teens and they have zero character outside the stereotypes you can see in any american show/movie whatever which features high school life. Hell, they don't even talk to each other outside the usual "WE WERE WORRYING ABOUT U GUYZ" or some ♥♥♥♥.\nAbout the monsters, it's dumb, the concept of them being vulnerable to light is good, but the game has no explanation WHY ON EARTH ARE THEY VULNERABLE. Since the monsters (it's not a major spoiler, but it's a detail which isn't obvious, you decide)  aren't "shadow" creatures, they are mutated persons for ♥♥♥♥'s sake. Why mutation causes them to hate light? Whatever	.\nSo now that we have the grasp of what kinda feel Obscure has when you think about it, we can move on to how it feels when you don't. Just like a B movie should feel, you can laugh on the logic bumps and "weird" execution or cringe on them. Mainly I was laughing, the whole game just screams "don't take me seriously pls".\n\nOutside of that the gameplay was actually fine. The fighting could be a little bit more complicated, outside of the final boss you're just lighting and shooting at random creatures. The best mechanic is that the game has perma death, if one of the five characters die it's not game over, the character just dies, no coming back, it adds to the feel that people usually DIE in horror themed stuff. There's also a part where you can basically kill one of your teammates by being an inattentive prick like me, that was super cool, I felt bad after that.\nAlso, you can combine items. Maybe back then it was a huge thing (I don't think so) that you can combine items, but I feel like that's not a big deal, not that big at least as people emphasize that. Your options are limited as hell, no reason to pee your knickers just because you can tape a flashlight to a handgun or a shotgun. You can also play co-op, but I didn't really care about that, I like my horror alone. But if you want to pop a beer and laugh while you're participating in some B horror action then Obscure is probably one of the best games for that.\n\nI shouldn't like this, but I had fun while playing so I don't care.","April 29","true","4.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

They find that while trying to find ther friend Kenny, that the Principal is conducting experiments on the students!\nREVIEW\nThe game looks alright for being made in 2004, the animations are all smooth, no lag, no issues here. The setting for the game is Leafmore High, the high school the kids attend along with some underground labs once you get halfway through the game. The environments look good, and shadows play a good part in the game, so you'll be using your flashlight a lot. The monsters are engulfed in darkness so you'll have to burn it off them with the flashlight.Be careful though, the flashlights battery can overheat. Now lets get to the good stuff... the dialouge. I'm not gonna lie, the dialouge in this game is actually o.k. It's the voice acting though that can get irritating. You can even sometimes hear a high pitched squeal whenever someones talking. The story is  very important to this game. You're gonna have to look everywhere and anywhere, if you're to find out the backstory, but none of this will be hard. Each of the main charcters have their own special ability. Josh has the ability to tell you if their's something left in the room to get. Shannon has the ability to tell you what to do or how to solve certain puzzles. Stan has the ability to pick locks, but all of the characters can do this, Stan just does it quicker. Ashley is skilled in combat and can double swing or double shoot a gun. Kenny who is the typical jock stereotype of the group, can sprint for at a high estimate 7 seconds before getting out of breath. I actually ran faster with Josh because he seems to take longer strides. The combat is ok but i had some recurring problems on certain bosses, you would have to stand at a certain angle and shoot, and i didnt figure this out till my 700th time through so i ended up wasting a lot of ammo. One thing i didn't like about the characters is that they all had their own personalities, which is fine! They just didnt seem emotionally attached to each other at all. For example, (SPOILERS) halfway though the game before we find Kenny, his sister Shannon dies, when we find Kenny, he doesnt ask abut where his sister is and nobody tells him! This is because anybody can die at any time, but there should still be some emotion!!! All in all i LOVED obscure, it just has some glaring issues that i couldnt overlook, i highly recommend this game.","October 21, 2014","true","5.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Obscure is an old school game that looks like a combination of Silent Hill and the early forms of Resident Evil. Obscure allows you to select five players, only allowing you two to use at a time. I chose (Not being racist just forgot her name) the African American female (Who I will refer as Deja?), who's an expert at fighting, and Josh, the one who can tell if you've forgotten something. At first, I thought this was an online Co-op, making a friend buy it too so we could both play. After we found out it was local co-op, he refunded it and was stingy at me for a few days.\nThe game though, I chose the normal mode, was difficult on pretty much any mode. It took me exactly SIX HOURS to complete, and rewarded me with a special mode that gave you wonderful prizes that you'll enjoy. The prologue sets a creepy ambience to your gameplay, and sending chills when you must escape. I was pretty shocked at the end of the prologue, and thought that was the end of the character. About an hour of gameplay, I didn't know you had to save. I spent an hour of gameplay walking around the map. I ended up getting Deja killed. I found out there were no checkpoints, so I restarted, playing the prologue again and finding out that discs help you save.\nAfter I found the discs, my gameplay began. I ended up at the courtyard and that's where things went wrong. I had no idea what to do and spent 20 minutes walking around. Before the 2 hour mark, I decided '♥♥♥♥ it' and quit and received a refund. About a week later, I found out OBSCURE and OBSCURE II were onsale for 5.07. I bought the game for 6.99 and I saw that as a steal. I bought both games, now seeing as I bought it again I should play it again.\nThankfully the game saved my progresses and I found out what to do. The variety of weapons in this game, the scarecity of ammo, the amount of monsters you must face, is exciting! Several times I had to conserve ammo, and sharing different guns with my partner proved to be a bit difficult. The story progressed and got darker as it went, which I loved. The partner AI though, seemed a bit disappointing, because she would attack so slowly and rarely. Several times I had to tell her to stay put while I finished off some important bosses.\nAt the end of the game, the boss seemed a bit easy, even on Normal, but it was a bit challenging for a two-stage fight. I loved the ending, it sent chills up my spine and I'm really considering playing the second one. This game was enjoyable and remembered me of my PS2 Nostalgia.","September 6, 2015","true","6.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While it borrows from several great franchises that came before it, there are still plenty of fresh ideas here. While the plot represents little more than a teenage horror flick, the game launches you into the action almost immediately and keeps you wondering when the next atrocious ugly will stake a claim on your life. There are no zombie hordes or hell demensions here either. This is a completely unique survival horror angle that makes from a refreshing experience despite being released nine years ago.\n\nAs game mechanics go, having a group of hapless teens to choose from and freely swap between makes the game feel more dynamic and versatile. Furniture and small objects will shift and scatter when bumped into, making the environments feel more interactive despite the camera angles being fixed. You'll spend a fair amount of searching for clues and gathering supplies like in any true survival horror game too. Having originally released for xbox and ps2, this game was developed with controller support in mind. Attempting to navigate this title without one will add unnecessary challenge to the game.\n\nWhile this isn't a AAA title, fans of the pre-action/horror genre of games from the 90's will likely enjoy this. If you are expecting this to be another Resident Evil 4-6 or Deadspace 3 then look elsewhere. This is a fairly dated game that should be enjoyed with a fair amount of respect for when it was released. For such an excellent price, I highly recommend this piece of videogame history to any survival horror fan.","March 11, 2014","true","7.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a story about how five young people pull together in a high stress situation, and learn that together they can win.\n\nMany times I found myself wondering why I would need tape to compete effectively, but then I learned that the hallways leading to the track were dark, and I couldn't hold a flashlight by itself, so I could tape the flashlights to different things to light my way.

And in many ways, it shines. Creature design is great, the underlying premise once you get past the "disposable teens" veneer isn't bad, and the variety of puzzles manages to keep things interesting while keeping in theme with the school campus setting. However, there are a lot of drawbacks to the game, to the point I'm not entirely sure why it receives such high praise.\n\nIn general, ObsCure seems rather player unfriendly. The UI itself is pretty solid, with the relegation of menus to the shoulder buttons on a controller proving fairly intuitive. Ammo and healing item scarcity seems reasonable, for the most part, and while there are some tough enemies, you're usually well-equipped to take care of them. Emphasis on "usually," which we'll get to shortly. However, the game seems to have overlooked something rather major in that there's no listing in the controls section as to how you can pass items and weapons on to your partner if you're playing single-player. I was several hours deep and frustrated by a long run of deaths before I finally found what button combination handed things over thanks to a FAQ, thus arming my second character with a second weapon in case their shotgun ran out.\n\nThe item scarcity also became an issue when boss monsters entered the picture. Rather than giving you the chance to maybe stock up on a bit more ammunition or healing items than normal before a big fight, you're left to pray that you've hoarded enough and that your last save disc was used somewhere not too far back. If you get far enough in, this can be game-ending, as you end up with less than adequate firepower to survive. I got so frustrated with what I think is the 2/3 point of the game that I sacrificed two of the five students in combat, just to keep the ones I actually liked having around going.\n\nObScure also gets cheaper and cheaper as the game wears on. The most egregious example I made it to occurs in the Dormitory area, late in the game, where hidden holes in a hallway floor result in instant death despite there presumably being a floor to land on, albeit with injury, beneath. This is the first instant death situation I can remember in the game, and it comes out of nowhere after everything else just smacked you really hard at worst. It just feels like a really unfair leap without any precedent. If it makes any difference, all of this was encountered on the Normal difficulty level.\n\nI'm tempted to give this another chance, maybe on Easy, just to see how the story resolves, but I don't recommend that anyone else suffer through it. Save yourself the frustration.","January 10","false","5.1"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","3"

There are a number of bugs that prevent you from playing this game.  I'm not sure why they trigger or why they happen so often.  First off the 4:3 is pretty ♥♥♥♥ed up considering it had a fix for the original.\n\nThe problem with the game is some objects disappear or can't be interacted with.  For instance at the VERY beginning of the game theres a cell phone your suppose to pick up and talk into.  Well the damn thing disappeared.  I reset the game and there it was.  Second bug was almost immediately after the intro area.  Your suppose to break a glass window with your bat.  SWING SWING SWING SWING SWING, reset, swing break...this kept happening for window you were suppose to break.\n\nI had to get a refund.

I bought the game under the premise it was a rip-off of Resident Evil, and classic Resident Evil is my favourite stuff in the world, so I thought I'd give it a go.  It is hardly reminiscent of Resident Evil in any respect.  It feels cumbersome to me, almost like an unfinished game, but so do SIlent Hill 1, 2, and 3, and it reminds me a *lot* of Silent Hill.  But I don't have high hopes for the story, which is one of the most important things in a Silent Hill game.  So, If you adore Silent Hill give this a try.\nThe differences between this and SIlent Hill are chiefly that of the teens you control any of them can die, which is interesting, the puzzles aren't as hard, and the inventory is real-time.","February 25, 2015","false","5.4"," 4 of 27 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","4","27","0","0"

And your character is standing there, waiting for instructions from you. Yeah, that same you that doesn't have a clue about what is going on because there is no manual.\n\nTurns out your supposed to get him to move. Great, I finally figure out how to get him to move. So he's walking around in circles. No popups telling you what buttons to mash or where to go, you just walk around in endless circles bumping into the door because hey, why not figure if you walk into the door you walk through it. With all the info you have to go on, that seems as good an idea as any.\n\nOnly he just walks into the door. Finally after 10 minutes of walking around and cussing, I happened to mash the A button on my controller while he was standing close to the basketball. ALL RIGHT!! That did something. A cut scene, where he shoots a foul shot, the ball lands on the floor, and.... back to square one. I figured maybe he had to make 3, or 5 or something foul shots in a row and that would "start something". Nope, after about 8 or 10, I stopped trying. Again, nothing popping up on the screen to help you and no manual.\n\nSo I walk over to one of the doors and mash the A button again and another cut scene, he opens the door, enters another room and a phone is ringing. I walk over to the phone, mash the A button, and another cut scene talking to his girlfriend. Great, I think, something is starting to happen.\n\nTwo door later, five miles of walking around later, and finally a couple of popups that finally helped a little later, I'm in this long corridor, with a flashlight taped to a gun, and something that you can't really make out (it just looks like black fog on my screen) is blocking your way and a popup comes up and says to shoot it. And which button to hold to aim. (Finally at least SOME help).\n\nSo I shoot the "thing". Six times. No more bullets. No help on how to reload, no help on whether you need extra ammo or if you just need to reload. Thinking I needed extra ammo, I spent another hour covering every inch of that long corrider and the room above where the gun was found in the first place and found no ammo, and pressed all the buttons on my controller trying to reload and after that hour, my last one, I wrote this.\n\nFor those of you who haven't played this, you've been fairly warned.","March 10, 2014","false","0.4"," 5 of 193 people (3%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","3","5","193","2","36"

What i really like about this game is how smooth the camera motions/captures during exploration and the cut scenes! I definitely recommend this game if you're into survival horror games in an high school environment.","September 8, 2014","true","28.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's brought to you by french developer Mighty Rocket Studio, formerly Hydravision Entertainment, it was ported to Windows at release and is now on Steam.\n\nIt's important to note that this is a console game first. While the keyboard controls are functional, you're much better off using a controller. Seems to also recognize Dualshock controllers, which is nice. It's also not compatible with widescreen, but there's a simple patch for that.\n\nObscure is a fantastic game that has been unfairly passed over by the annals of time.\n\nBoth the art and sound direction are absolutely terrific. Leafmore High is dripping with the combination of gothic aesthetic and the engulfing crumminess of any public highschool. Stained urinals and vandalized desks go hand in hand with imposing stone structures and wrought iron gates. A gargoyle would not have been out of place on its crumbling frame.\n\nA soundtrack of grim orchestra and childlike choires provides the backdrop as you make like an American and shoot your way through this school. The gameplay is terrific - no tank controls and a generous run speed means you can actually evade, dodge and bait enemies instead of eating damage. There's an Alan Wake style mechanic of dispelling darkness from enemies with light - but unlike Alan Wake, it lowers defenses instead of being mandatory to hit them at all.\n\nThey balanced out the fun gun and movement mechanics by having the melee be horrible. From wonky hitbox collision to indeterminate hitstun, to an absurdly long startup animation that's frequently interrupted - at no point during the game is melee ever in danger of being fun. Thankfully there's no a single situation where you're forced or expected to use melee during your first playthrough, so Hydravision probably knew this.\n\nBut besides the fantastic art, gameplay, sound, and performing very well on any system, Obscure isn't perfect and there's a few key elements that prevent it from reaching heights, and might explain the terrible Metacritic score.\n\nThe game is "built around" a (local only) co-op mechanic where a second player or the AI takes control of another classmate. There's a distinct problem with this - the AI is windowlicking stupid. Aside from refusing to perform several core mechanics, it will frequently run straight into damage, block your way and will attack once every 10 seconds. Thankfully you can just ditch it and play through the game solo - which is fun, viable and frankly easier with the scarce resources - but unless you know to do that it can significantly affect your experience.\n\nEvery instance of the map ingame is clearly unfinished. There's a few rooms in every building (and one giant building that's just on the map) that you flat-out cannot enter, which is a major letdown and tease in any survival horror. I want to explore and strip a place clean, and I suspect the reason I cannot do that is that those rooms are not modeled and don't exist.\n\nAdd to that, that the story doesn't make sense and isn't engaging on any level. The characters are interchangeable and don't matter - you have to be able to complete the game if any of them die. There's no character development, no memorable lines, the support NPCs aren't interesting and don't say much - it's a flimsy excuse to kill zombies and it shows. There's also some audio problems with dialogue cutting out, but the VA isn't even endearingly bad.\n\nObscure is worth both your time and money, and is a brilliant survival horror whether you're a fan of the genre or just interested.\n\nWhy it didn't do better than it has is anyone's guess, but even now it is not a game that will waste your time looking into it.","September 3, 2015","true","12.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is co op, however it is very... odd. It seems like it wasn't properly optimized. For example, player 1 takes damage and the edges of the screen flash red. Now if you heal the red would normally go away. the same happens with player 2. You don't know who is hurt until you both try to heal. another thing wrong with the co op is the camera. The camera is fixed to one player, so one player needs to be close to the first player to see where they are. The camera makes the players clumsy.\n\nThere is also a habit for the game to crash occasionally. It my be my machine or it's just a bug. If you are playing singleplayer then the game is tolerable with a few bugs. If you can co operate with your partner in terms of movement then it is also fine.","July 7, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Do you remember the Resident Evil knock offs that followed in it's footsteps and oversaturated the survival horror genre to extinction? How about the teenage high school horror movies that came out around the same time? If you do, then you know what to expect with Obscure. It's exactly what you think it is, and it's a pretty funny nostalgia trip, too.\n\nI won't say Obscure is “good”, but I'll recommend it anyway with a few stipulations. Firstly, coming in at the tail end of the tank control era allows it to be surprisingly playable by modern standards. The controller mapping is certainly strange; you hold LB/RB to bring up your inventory options and cycle through them with the right stick, holding the action button to bring up commands. It's unique to say the least, but once you get the hang of it it works functionally as well as any other control scheme I guess. You also can have a second character that's either controlled by the AI or by a second player. I didn't try it cooperatively, but the AI works very well for the most part. The second player is optional, but serious kudos for including that feature and making it work much better than the disaster I expected.\n\nThe story and setting is very generic; you control a half dozen high school students whose principal is hiding a dark secret and conducting genetic experiments on the student body in his mad scientist lab underneath the school yard. As stated: Resident Evil plus any '90s high school horror movie paints an accurate picture. It's all very small scale; the school and the underground tunnels make up the entirety of the environments you'll be exploring, and it's a short game that won't challenge you with brain teasers or difficult combat/resource management. In fact, I found trying to avoid enemies useless, and (on Normal, anyway) you seem required to pump bullets into every John Carpenter's The Thing enemy you come across to progress.\n\nAs copy-and-paste as Obscure is in design, there are a few noteworthy innovations that were well ahead of their time. The co-op is now a staple of modern survival horror games like the newer Resident Evils and Dead Space. Also, I thought the main combat mechanic of Alan Wake (shining a flashlight on darkness-covered monsters before you shot them) was a fresh concept... Obscure features this exact same loop and it came out five years prior. Sure, Alan Wake is a much better game, but Obscure should get credit where credit is due. Another fun tidbit: Until Dawn made a big hoopla about main characters dying but the story continuing without them. Obscure did it a decade earlier. You can swap between the six kids at will. They each have unique special abilities, and if they die they're gone. You then have to find the spot they died to collect any weapons they were carrying ala Dark Souls. Again, not saying Obscure is a great game, but much respect for being way ahead of the curve.\n\nThe main reason I came away from Obscure with a positive outlook is because it's hilariously bad. It's B-movie cheese at it's finest, with CGI cutscenes and stereotypical dialogue that's just too unintentionally funny to pass up. As far as survival horror games of it's ilk go it's not nearly as offensively archaic as most, so you're left with a short highlight reel of what makes those games so good/bad. With the right sense of humor and appreciation for the genre, Obscure is definitely worth a look for the stoner kid's lines alone.","October 22, 2015","true","6.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Baraho/recommended/254460/","Baraho","Baraho","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Baraho/","132 products in account","Abridged review (personal insights below):\n+ Offers a bit of a challenge, even on Normal mode.\n+ Brilliantly eerie atmosphere.\n+ A co-op system ahead of its time.\n+ Each playable character has his/her own unique passive and active abilities. That was a lot of fun to explore.\n+ A few unlockables, such as weapons and costumes, offer some replay value.\n- When playing solo, AI-controlled partners are more burdensome than helpful.\n- Enemy designs, while innovative, are way too few. There's only like 5 of them in the whole game,\n- The story may give the impression of being profound and convoluted, but it really is not.\n\nRecommendtation: For horror enthusiasts who have not played this game yet, it will be a fresh and invigorating experience, reminiscent of a time when "survival horror" actually meant something. However, don't expect anything revolutionary. I don't know how much the game cost, but it appears to have had a modest budget.\n\n----------------\nI first played an hour into the sequel of this game (Obscure: The Aftermath) back when it first came out 8 years ago, without knowing it had a predecessor. As soon as I found out, I stopped, and promised myself I'd play the original Obscure before delving into the sequel any further. I fulfilled that promised just now.\n\nMost of the game's shortcomings, few and far in between as they may be, can be attributed to the team's seemlingly low budget and humble technical capabilities at the time. Despite those handicaps, however, they managed to create a spectacular experience with what they'd got. Their ambitious approach to a Resident Evil / Silent Hill-esque experience is certainly unique and engaging. though not without flaws.\n\nFor instance, Resident Evil 3 had me jump through hoops, retrace my steps, carefully calculate my ammo and herb usage just to gain some progress, which some frown upon, but I find to be vital survival horror elements. I this game, however, I rarely felt this. I always knew where I was supposed to go next, and what to do there. This gave the game an almost linear feel; consequently, I almost never felt scared or lost. But that's just me.\n\nThe co-op system is thrilling, but having a partner when playing solo can be cumbersome; they tend to get in the way and you lose the true ending if they die, which they happen to be fond of doing quite often. If you're playing alone, I strongly recommend you command your partner to wait at the gathering point in the middle of the school, where they can be safe and not get in the way.\n\nThe story appears to have only existed as a means to an end: to let you know why the school has gone to hell. There are no "obscurities" or profound revelations, nothing that really counts as a twist, and as soon as you pick up the first couple of newspaper clippings or files, you will most likely have figured out the whole conspiracy. As a storytelling enthusiast, I found that to be a bit of a letdown, since it had the potential to offer something far more grand.\n\nAll in all, I savored every minute of this game and the aforementioned issues did not really get in the way of my enjoyment; I liked it with all of its flaws, just like I like Resident Evil's terrible voice acting.","January 4","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
