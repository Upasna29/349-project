You move around in this game as a spaceship which can be rotated either horizontally or vertically with a press of the right mouse button.  The left mouse buttons shoots out laser beams from each end of your spaceship that turns into a solid line once it hits it's nearest boundary line or section you've already filled in.  Once that line is established, it turns solid and if a section of the grid is now empty of any enemies, that section is filled in and counts towards your "goal % to complete" to conquer that level.\n\nThis is much easier demonstrated by watching my video, but the gameplay is very fun and addictive!  Add in tons of levels to beat with a crazy amount of power-ups and enemies with their own special movements and attacks, and this game offers a LOT of game for the money!\n\nFantastic arcade style game that I've played about 5 hours before I even got my code on Steam!\n\nMy score:  85% (out of 100).  "Fantastic Value for an addictive old school arcade remake with it's own unique style!"","April 9, 2015","true","1.0"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","77","17","22","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/recommended/346780/","kalirion","kalirion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalirion/","2884 products in account","Luminosity is a fun take on the classic JezzBall, with the addition of multiple different enemy types, power ups, ships (i.e. the player character), and purchasable upgrades (in-game currency, not micro transactions.)\n\nThere are two ways to play - the Campaign and the Arcade modes.\n\nThe Campaign mode consists of 4 sets of 9 levels each, and as you proceed through them you first unlock the Arcade mode and then additional ships for it.  You get three health points for each level, and if you lose them all you can just keep trying until you get it.  You can earn 3 star ratings for each campaign level, depending on the amount damage sustained while beating it.\n\nThe Arcade mode lets you pick a starting ship and difficulty setting, and then sets you against an infinite (?) set of levels which increase in difficulty as you progress through them.  You don't get 3 health per level this time around - once you lose all your health, it's to the Game Over / High Score screen.  Each completed level gives you a crystal, which can be spent on select temporary power-ups or damage repair.   The crystals aren't saved between runs, so don't hoard them when you're on the last hit point!\n\nThe basics: you control a  "ship" which shoots laser out of its opposite sides in order to divide & conquer each level.  The ship can be rotated so that you control whether the lasers are launched horizontally or vertically.  Once both lasers reach the edges of an"un-conquered" portion of the field, it gets divided, and any side which has no enemies becomes "conquered." he goal is to conquer a required percentage of the field, which allows you to proceed to the next level. When not firing, the ship is invincible and all enemies can pass right through it. While firing, the ship becomes immobilized and loses a health/hit point if any enemies touch either the lasers or the ship. Each level has a time limit, but in my experience it is usually long enough to be a non-issue (though perhaps this changes in the higher Arcade levels.)\n\nAdditionaly, more tricky enemies are introduced in latter levels.  Some are faster than others, or more unpredictable, or bounce around like crazy for a while before resting, or fire bullets at regular intervals, etc.\n\nPower-ups randomly show up to bounce around the gameplay area, and can be picked up by either firing the laser through them, or conquering the area of the fields they are currently in - which means picking these up puts you in the same risk from enemies as just going around conquering the field.  The power-ups are mostly temporary, and include such useful functions invulnerability, huge laser speed boosts, and damage repair.  A couple of the power-ups - TNT and Destroyer - are also the only methods by which enemies can actually be destroyed, as opposed to being merely blocked in.\n\nAll ships (aside from the starting "Vanilla") have special traits which greatly impact the gameplay.  For example, the "Ancient" starts each level with very fast laser speed but has 1 less max health, and the laser speed decreases each time you fire it, while the "Boomerang" has a slightly faster than normal laser, but rotates with every shot and cannot be rotated manually.\n\nAs you play the Arcade mode, in addition to the normal points to put you on the high score list, you also get rewarded with in-game currency.  This money is used to purchase ship upgrades such as increased max health, increased laser speed, or a small chance to block damage from enemies.  These upgrades are limited to the Arcade mode, and automatically applied to all player ships - no need to purchase separate upgrades for each one.\n\nThe graphics are simple but attractive.  The music is good, though seems limited to only one or two looping tracks - but this hasn't gotten annoying for me because it complements the feel of the game, and just stays in the background so that I don't notice it much.\n\nAnd the dev has been active in the community hub discussions and responsive to suggestions and bug reports, which is always large plus :)\n\nAll in all, this is a very nice arcade game, and I'd recommend it to any fan of the genre.","May 13, 2015","true","7.7"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Fast pace but not crazy overwhelming.  The music is perfect for the game.  The power ups are great and this really reminds me of old school arkanoid except that its not really like that game at all other than you move around a rectangle in space.  The gameplay is simple:  you shoot lasers out your two ends which within a brief period turn into a solid wall.  You have to basically wall off the enemies and each level you must aquire a bit more extra space--simple.  The effects are cool with time destortion, and also double size, immortality, etc. prob why it reminds me of arkanoid.  The levels are quick and you can replay them if you keep failing.  Also the levels and enemy positions are random each time which makes it when you do fail feel fresh and not keyboard bash worthy.\n\nThe game looks sick, sounds dope, and is just fun for any amount of time.  Arcade mode ups the challenge with seein how many levels you can last.  The game says you get 3 lifes but its more like 3 hit points as each one damages your ship.\n\nGot it in a greenlight bundle but having played it i'd say its well worth its $5 asking price.","April 10, 2015","true","0.6"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

I wish the playfield was a little bigger, because I feel the UI wastes a lot of space. Other than that, no major complaints.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/346780/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","A blast from the past, Luminosity borrows the basic idea from the likes of Qix, Barrack and JezzBall and expands on it.\n\nIn Luminosity a bunch of drones is bouncing around in a rectangular chamber. Your job is to trap them into smaller chambers by shooting lasers in both directions. Lasers solidify when hitting walls but are destroyed if hit by the drones before that. Idea is simple but it becomes challenging quickly.\n\nInstead of staying totally abstract, Luminosity adds a simple context to the game: you are operating a space ship and must fly across the galaxy and planets while entrapping these drones. Unfortunately, this development is left stub: other than the brief lore about different ships, there's no other established lore or motivation available.\n\nWhat is left is a pretty abstract game of concentration and timing your clicks right. In every level there's a bunch of drones (usually from 2 to 10 or so). Usually you have to cover about 50 to 70 per cent of the level to beat it. What's new are the differing properties and types of enemies, drones. The basic drone just flies around in straight lines at a fixed speed. Among the special ones there's e.g. an annoying irregular one that can change direction and speed randomly and a death star that shoots blaster beams. The special ones include the various motherships that serve as bosses in the story mode.\n\nStory has you going through several galaxies, each with 9 worlds (i.e. levels) to clear. The story mode serves naturally as a tutorial, adding features, power ups, enemy types and player ships as you advance. Each galaxy ends with a boss fight and unlocks a new player ship to use in the arcade mode. Conveniently, it forces you to try all the ships you might want to use later in the arcade mode.\n\nArcade mode is your regular game mode from JezzBall: just a level after level of both more enemies and more enemy diversity. There are four difficulty levels with varying enemy speeds and this time there are global leaderboards. Here you have to also choose a ship, the apparatus that you control. It affects the speed of the lasers, your maximum health and usually has some special quality as well. My favourite was the Shield: ship that can bounce drones away from your lasers. I also liked the one with time-delayed but faster lasers. One special ship rotates only on shooting lasers, while usually you can do it at will. The variety with ships is quite nice.\n\nAs you progress in the arcade mode, you collect crystals that can be used to unleash power ups like (temporary) invulnerability and time slowing. Some of these power-ups also appear in the level and can be collected for temporary boosts. Upon your ultimate failure, you get some gold to buy helpful upgrades for the ship, easing your future endeavours rather significantly.\n\nTo my pleasure, my initial qualms have largely been addressed by the recent patch. This shows that the developers are still keen on updating the game and even issuing content upgrades, considering a new enemy type was added in the same patch.\n\nLuminosity offers a fine alternative for blowing up some free time. Fairly casual, one full game in arcade mode lasts about 20 minutes (less if you screw up a lot) and the story mode can be beaten in less than couple of hours. I'd wager 100% completion would take anything from 5 to 10 hours depending on your skill and, partly, luck. In my view the present price (5 euros) is fairly adequate for this game.","May 3, 2015","true","8.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

The overall goal from map to map is the same: section off enough parts of the map to satisfy the percentage goal.  While your ship can't directly be hurt by enemies on the map, they can damage you should they run into the laser you fire off to section it off.  Therein lies the strategy...do you split and quarantine one or two enemies at a time, or try to coral all of them into one section?  I personally like the arcade mode better than the campaign levels and I also like the fact that you can permanently upgrade your ship with gold...it gives you something to work towards as you play.

Oh, how wrong I was. Yes, the game has already been bundled five times and has only been reviewed 30 times (as of writing) on Steam meaning that more often than not it has been used as an idle trading card game but here is yet another indie game that is much more than that. It’s a basic score attack game that has both an arcade mode as well as a campaign mode where the player controls his space ship and you attempt to conquer the map to the required level – generally somewhere around the 60 percent mark. But what makes it so addictive is the quick pace of the action combined with the intelligence of smart quick thinking strategy. It’s a match made in heaven that instantly makes me think that Luminosity is exactly the type of game that I would have poured my quarters into at the arcade when I was younger.\n\nThe graphics are suitable – they’re nothing flashy but they don’t need to be. They get the job done. The game’s soundtrack is a high point. It’s pumping along at just the right pace without ever feeling too frantic or too slow. It’s easy on the ears and really fits the game.\n\nI’ve seen people criticize the size of the playfield but I would disagree with this. Any larger and it would quite possibly become too frustrating to play while anything smaller would do the same thing dependent upon the number of enemies on the screen at the start of each level. If there is anything to critique about the game is that it can become rather repetitive. However, I personally find this type of repetitive gameplay enjoyable because the game is designed to be played in short bursts. I wouldn’t recommend to play this for hours but rather sharp fifteen minutes to half an hour periods where you can play a few games and try to top your previous high score or to aim to get further on the global leaderboard.\n\nLuminosity is addictive. It could be my gaming kryptonite in regards to procrastination. It’s definitely ‘just one more game’ material.\n\nFor more reviews similar to this one and our daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/","January 14","true","16.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

The game grants invulnerability to your paddle/ship as a trade-off - only your laser can be hurt. In all honesty, it felt a bit limited to me. The boss mechanic (a ship you have to lure away, as it is trolling you) is also a tad obnoxious and not particularly interesting in my opinion. On the bright side, the developper put in a lot of ideas, which might help in the long run, but might also hurt the score-attack aspect of the game, as the levels are randomly generated and some can be quite unfair.\nThe visual design is not that great either.\nBut seeing the lack of alternative for that particular genre, I recommend it, "slightly".\nIf only Barrack were to be revived, some day, maybe...","April 13, 2015","true","1.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

Your fence-making machine fires vertically or horizontally, but takes time to travel from one edge of the ranch to the other.  It's also fragile enough that it breaks if it touches a rabbit.\n\nThat's the basic gist of the game.  There are tons of wrinkles, of course.

The fact that there are multiple types of ships that have other abilities, shoot lasers and the powerups go a long way in keeping this game from getting boring.
