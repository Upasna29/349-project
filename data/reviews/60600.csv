I have not had any problems with the game besides the Steam achievements not working.","September 8, 2014","true","5.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

It lacks a bit of polish, and the upgrading system is kind of confusing, after you get the hang of it, you should be fine. It features four-player co-op as well (even local co-op), which is always a plus. It might not be worth the $9.99 price tag, but I'd say it's worth the $3.40 sale price for sure.","June 3, 2011","true","1.5"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's a pretty straightforward arcade game: seperate controls for moving and firing; try to manage both as best as you can while you're being bombarded by up to a dozen enemies at once.\n\nThe tutorial it thin. But what really put me off is that it's the kind of game where you might play a 5-minute level for 4:30, fail at the end, and then have to start the entire level over. Bleh. The repetition is painful.\n\nI do not recommend this game.","June 4, 2011","false","0.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"
