Studio Nyx has outdone themselves by making a faithful adaptation to the board game that features Electronic Warfare (Fog of War that would make Space Hulk take notice), balanced gameplay with varied character classes, and a rather extensive list of maps and objectives to complete on each mission. Those who have played the old school XCOM games (or Xenonauts) or Space Hulk will fit right in with this one. It's a little more fast paced than either but if one mistake is made, your whole team is going down, all the same. As a side note, I love the artwork in this game too... makes me think of old Comic books. This for only 19.99 is a damn good deal.

You are not overburdened with useless tactical options, but the one's you have, are essential for victory.\nThis is tactics at it's best, and you can quickly see that the developers have put much love into it's making.\nIt defiantly has that 'one more turn' feature, and is very hard to turn off for the night.\n\nThe AI is extremely good, so when it does make a mistake, you need to exploit it without pause.  Some maps will take you many restarts before you triumph, but it's really great fun finding the right path of action.\n\nThe price is reasonable, and the game worth said price.  If you like your tactics, your going to love this.\nDid I mention that when you turn on the FOW, it becomes a spooky tactical game?\n\nUpdate: This game feels abandoned.  No word from the developers, with only one half-arsed patch.\nSltherine new policy seems to be throw out as many money grab games as possible, and then forget they even exist.\nBe aware of this when viewing future game published by Slithrine.","July 16, 2015","true","2.4"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","22","29","2","0"

The look of LEGIONS OF STEEL conjures up comic book memories of ALIEN LEGION and games i used to play on the Commodore Amiga 500 which delivered the whole package in a very visceral satisfying potent way. Its a fun kind of tough where even losing feels exhilarating all the while learning from ones mistakes and going back into the fray to attempt to do better.\n\nIn LEGIONS OF STEEL combat flows with graceful lethal elegance as units move in a battle ballet of death seeking to achieve the most advantageous tactical position to annihilate their foes. Engaging the enemy means knowing when to do certain command maneuvers such as a strafing attack where the combatant steps out into the open to blast the Machine enemy with metal shredding fire then fade back into cover with such speed one forgets this is a turn based marvel of strategic controlled chaos as they would say in the old ALIEN LEGION comic books.\n\nPlayer and enemy turns are geniously done via table top style dice roll to see who wins the intiative to decide which side moves first. This adds another level of strategy as the player with the initiative roll may decide its better to let the enemy move first as they wait for that right momemt to engage in a ambush maneuver. Before each firing encounter the player can click on the fire panel to see what modifiers are effecting their chances of getting a hit or not thus allowing them to make a decision to fire, move to a more advantageous location or wait until they are in a better situation to engage such as when grenades with different vision and area effects are making for a difficult successful shot or one of your fellow Commandos is in your line of fire thus making for a penalty modifier to hit. Ah wonderful wonderful modifiers!\n\nThen there are throwable weapons like the force wall which comes in extremely handy in desperate situations when the enemy needs slowing down or their line of sight blocked buying the player some time to gather their wits and launch a counter attack or retreat to more advantageous ground. The Machine enemy also have their own plethora of grenade weapons which effect the battlefield or just outright kill those who stand against their all consuming might.\n\nHave i mentioned yet that there are also ballistic and energy weapons?\n\nAnimations compliment the futuristic art style perfectly giving inhuman alien menace to The Machines and vigilant heroic stature to The Commandos. Storyboard screens are rich with comic book artistry alive with violently valiant imagery urging the player to continue their war against The Machines.\n\nThere is both a lengthy campaign mode and skirmish mode where you can play either as the desperately fighting for survival Commandos or the indomitable relentless Machines. For those who desire for more fleshlike opponents there is hot seat as well as multiplayer for your.. special needs.\n\nMusic and sound effects transform my reality into unreality as i suddenly find myself in a science fiction audioscape as if out of the movies FORBIDDEN PLANET and ALIEN among many other forboding paradise nightmare worlds. Truly audiophile elite level of quality.\n\nLEGIONS OF STEEL table top majesty in a digital age where screaming metal and liquified flesh fill the battlefields of tomorrow. Buy it! Play it! Decimate in terror all before you!","July 16, 2015","true","6.0"," 16 of 27 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","16","27","0","0"

The UI not only looks as if it was design for an IPad, it has the same icons as if it did...\n\nConclusion: Instant Refund, the gamestate is on par to an Alpha stage, and yet\nthe price is $20. Not worth.\n\n------------------------------------------Edit -------------------------------------\n@Sukhoi,\nLook you're the dev. Seeing someone bash your baby might be hard news I get it I'm a programmer myself. But I am also familiar with unity and what it takes for a game to be considered finished. Using the Unity Launcher with its fixed resolution options on startup, its uninformative quality settings from fastest- fantastic is not what a finished game makes.\n\n\nLet me give you an example, the options menu I am referring AT MINIMUM should allow me to:\n\nA) Change between fullscreen and windowed\nB) Change resolution settings\nC) Anti-Alias (2x at minimum)\nD) Gamma Settings\nE) Shadows if applicable\nF) Texture quality.\n\nThe user should NEVER be locked into a resolution or windowed/fullscreen and have to EXIT THE CLIENT to change settings. There's a reason every game indie to triple A has this minimum feature. That ALONE was enough to tell me not much thought went into the game itself.\n\nA game is half UI, half mechanics. If you have beautiful mechanics and a clunky UI, the user experience suffers, if the UI is gorgeus but you have no game, same thing.\n\n\nNext point:\nThe game is charged at $20,\n\nFrom what I can tell you utilize a 2.5D approach. The character models are in 3D, and the environment is in 2D. Meanwhile the entire game is played from an isometric top down view. Why the ♥♥♥♥ are the characters in 3D, using an HDR animated sprite would convey more information in a more presentable manner than simply using 3D models for the sake of having 3D models.\n\nIt's as if you included the 3D models to justify a 20 dollar asking price...it doesn't, in fact in this scenario had you gone with HDR textures you'd of allowed for finer detail, stronger asthetic and a $15 asking price without any complaints.\n\nUI + This weird Design decision do not warrant $20.\n\nFinal Point:\n\nWhen you port a game, if at any point the user is able to see the game does not look like it belongs on the system, then the user will feel ripped off. This is not just my experience look at the Arkham Knight reviews on steam PC vs PS4 reviews....it feels, looks, and acts like a shi**y port for pc so people are pi$$ed. Meanwhile on PS4 everyone loves it. Your's behaves fine, but having a giant blurry Android/Iphone/IPad like gui that doesn't scale well with monitor resolution makes me wonder why it's not charged at 5 dollars.  I could be wrong on this, but  I have never even heard of a game that costs 20 dolars on the Play/App store, let alone one selling well.\n\n\nIn the end the game feels unfinished, it looks unfinished, regardless whether or not you'd call it unfinished, that is my take. Had you posted this as an Early Access called it a Beta for example and then got feedback to fix these issues, perhaps my negativity would be directed towards certain mechanics, or perhaps I wouldn't have a single negative view and actualy recommend this product. Unfortunatly that is not the case, and my opinion.","July 22, 2015","false","0.1"," 52 of 97 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","52","97","5","7"

Well i decided to try this out and you know what? This game is a perfect compliment to your strategy collection. This is really the opposite of space hulk (powerful military might in small number against an endless hoard of lesser intelligence beasts). The concept in this game instead of dissimilar opponents, is much more based on two more equal enemies in terms of intelligence and weaponry. The difference between the games is very much worth your money because this title really has its very own feel and in a very good way. I did encounter a bug where the enemy turn would keep running forever so i had to restart. Apart from that very minor annoyance, the game is absolutely fun and challenging. If you like turn based tactical strategy, this is your ticket for a great ride due to the combination of luck/skill making each game a little different and therefore very replayable. You can play a nice quick round anytime you like which is always a good thing thanks to the skirmish mode with the same maps from the campaign as well as a few new ones. Bottom line, its worth the asking price and worth your time. Good luck in your struggle against the machines!","July 20, 2015","true","10.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

I heard about it last night, and instantly started doing research about it.  As mentioned before, I tried to help with the Kickstarter and after it didn’t go through, I was bummed.  Yes, I probably could have tried to keep up with the Legions of Steel news and watched it develop, but I didn’t.  Call me lazy, or busy, but for whatever reason it dropped off my radar.\n\nRight now I’ve played multiple hours of the game.\nHoly crap is it fun!  I didn’t even bother to run the tutorial or the rules, I wanted to approach it with the rules I learned when playing the board game all those years ago.\n\nLet me tell you, while it’s not identical to the board game, it’s really damn close!  I mean, it would be impossible to mimic every element of the board game, but to be honest, some of those rules were thick to understand to begin with.  This PC version takes the guesswork out of it and inject pure fun into your eyes.\n\nThe graphics are wicked cool, the music is haunting and exciting at the same time.\n\nThe Setting:\nThe Future.  Okay, we just took the Past, mashed it with the Present, and now we are flinging it into the Future!  Whhheeeeeeeeee!!!!!\nThe League of Aliens and the United Nations of Earth (U.N.E.) have teamed up to keep at bay a new threat to the galaxy, The Machines.\n\nGamePlay:\nLegions of Steel is a tun based game.  Each unit has it’s own set of skills and characteristics.  Different weapons can be used and sometimes you have to use the map as a weapon itself!\nYou can also choose to play singleplayer missions or go against another player in multiplayer mode.\nIn the board game’s set up, players took turns setting up snap together cardboard tiles that created the scenario you were to play in.  As best as I can tell so far, you do not do that here, all of the maps are premade.\n\nPlatforms:\nRight now Legions of Steel is available for the PC and iOS.  At the time of this writing there is no release date yet for Android but I will update with one when I find out!\n\nThe Cost:\nYou can purchase it for a measly $18.00 from Steam or from the iTunes store!  EIGHTEEN bucks!  That’s dirt cheap for this wicked cool game!  Hell, the board game itself was about $60.00!\n\nBottom Line:\nGO GET THIS GAME!\n","July 20, 2015","true","376.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","1"
