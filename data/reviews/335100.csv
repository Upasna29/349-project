Worth the 3 dollars for the amount of fun you'll have.\n\nImagine, if you will, a game of battleship, except instead of trying to guess where their battleship is in an ocean, you're a mage that's chucking fireballs and floods at your opponent.  That's what this game is; wizard battleships.\n\nThere's no story as far as I can tell, but the gameplay and strategy can vary greatly depending on what rooms you are randomly given each turn.\n\nSide note:  multiplayer (while fixed with the last update) is much like any other small game; pretty sparse but fun as hell when you find someone to play with.  More often than not, I'm playing singleplayer.  I will be picking this game up for some friends for a little gaming fun one night for sure.  Definitely worth looking into.","January 10, 2015","true","1.7"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","24","29","3","7"

Needs more tune, far from perfect, but with some more work it could be great.\nMy Gf compared it to poker - half luck, half tactics.\n\nIm mostly interested in the multiplayer part of the game.\nRecently the main problem is the lack of balance. Its not rare when one player gets good stuff and the other nothing useful for long turns and loose without any chance. The randomness is far too high in this regard.\nWe found another problem when a game lasts too long (dozens of rounds). After a while its impossible to finish it in practice. The players get too much rooms and resources and neither of them can carry out an attack combo strong enough to win.\n\nThe software itself is very buggy now. Got 2 freeze in multiplayer from 8-10 games, randomised attacks try to damage rooms already destroyed in that round, sometimes the cancel button doesnt work etc. The execution is fairly weak now. Should be in early access.\n\nYou may ask if I listed a lot of problems with this game why I still recommend it? Cuz when it works its very enjoyable! There is every possibility to solve those problems and then it would be a really good little game for a fair price.\n\nI hope the dev will solve the problems and let us enjoy this game as it really should be!\n\nI will check back on and off and if needed I will change my review in the light of future development.","March 19, 2015","true","29.2"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","6"

Well done! All issues i had were adressed and i can finally change the review to a positive one.\n\nThe utterly repulsive idea about FB integration was removed and tutorial made good and accessible, removing the confusion and allowing for somewhat enjoyable gameplay.\n\nDevelopers have plans to improve the game, like many other progressive ones, like FTL or DOE at by the looks of it no additional cost. Raising their credibility and faith in them.\n\nNotice that the patches arrived very early - clear sign of devs working to improve, maybe it was slow for some, but for small studios with limited personel thats absolutely fine.\n\nSo far ive seen the content to put the game on 4.5/10 or 5/10. And with the promise of improvement that will be easy 6/10.\n\nNow to the core gameplay -> so far i have seen little change, but the gameplay mechanics were fine to begin with. Its not an AA type product but it has earned its space on steam. And i can only hope the developers will continue to strive for excellence.\n\nOnly thing left to improve upon would be perhaps sound? While Kevin produces high quality music, i feel that perhaps there should be a difference within the music depending on  how the game is going. You know how in FTL there is exploration and battle music? In Payday there is stealth/assault/stealth blown but no assault/planning style, - since the days of old there were changes to music in games differentiating depending on how the game goes. What im talking about is perhaps something like in Democracy 3 where there is vastly different music depending on how bad your situation is. I know its kind of a ♥♥♥♥♥ to ask but when tower is in flames, things are crumbling left and right and there is "Vivacity" playing doesnt really set the mood. Then again the player who's base is up in flames and that track playing might still keep the positive spirit up.\n\n\n\nHere is the full transcript of dialog wit the devs at 08/01/2015:\niosoftware: Q8IRB-P8XXH-X38BJ\nDesert Flower: what\niosoftware: this is access to Dwarf Tower beta versions for you\niosoftware: fixed the tutorial and the Reflector already\nDesert Flower: ugh must i really? i got other things to do oh? Nice! very very good!\niosoftware: Got crashes to fix now\nDesert Flower: there were no crashes before its like one of the finer points of the game, then agian i played too little with all the ragequitting : )\niosoftware: we do plan a single player rogue mode alike for it by the way\niosoftware: similar to ftl\niosoftware: grand enemy tower out there, you walk to it hex by hex\nDesert Flower: oh man now THAT sounds exciting!\niosoftware: other enemies can be destroyed or 'talked into' helping you\niosoftware: so the final battle will have more towers in the background, some helping you\nDesert Flower: Oo you guys were very busy by the looks of it D: sounds amazing\nDesert Flower: but yeh i can see why there would be a lot of bugs with all those improvements\niosoftware: not for the next update, but we had that idea for quite a while\n\nOld Review:\n\nChaotic mess in dire need of tutorial and descriptions.\n\nBought it mostly because there was 'music by Kevin MacLeod' i was thinking - i love that guy he makes great music! And what did we get in the game? Use of his previously made songs. Are his music pieces available for commercial use for free? If not did they even license this? If the answer is yes - thats probably the big chunk of the cost right there. If the answer is no i have no ♥♥♥♥ing idea what did people expend money on to create this to justify the cost. Strippers and coke? Hell if i know.\n\nVery not recommended. At least untill there is a comprehencible tutorial.\n\nEdit: Allright i went through the tutorial which didnt explain much. It was tunnelvision click this to proceed. At the end of which is a check mark, which does nothing but light up. Spamming it 20-40 times resulted into nothing aswell. So i had to manually get out of the tutorial. Did you even test this?  What about combat sequences/build ones? We get items every turn... are they random? What is going on? What if i dont place one? Do i miss out on construction or perhaps i get more options next turn? ♥♥♥♥ if i know.\n\nThen it got to a 'Reflector' item which i cant place, not because i lack space to use it on, no no. I cant place it because to be able to do that i have to go to Facebook and like thier game. Really now? Some people dont use facebook. Im supposed to go over there and make account and then synch the said account with steam just so i can get item which is already in the game to work? This is cancer like on disk dlc, however here it out ♥♥♥♥ing right says its there but ♥♥♥♥ you, cant do that. Go like our ♥♥♥♥.\n\nSometimes enemy starts with base already build, sometimes he builds at the same time as you do. How is any of it determined? How long did this take to make? Weeks?\n\nQuestion to the devs, suppose you could play some average game or Dwarf Tower that you created. Which one would that be? If the answer is DT then didnt you playtest some of this ♥♥♥♥? Have you shown it to your friends to ask oppinion? How was this developed? Christ almighty. I would ask for a refund but steam would take ages and i believe in supporting indie developers. And at the moment Deveopers of this game need some hash loving support.\n\nDont buy this till its patched and dropped in price.\n\nTo devs: get your ♥♥♥♥ together, come on. I dont care if this is your 1st release ever learn from mistakes of others, ask second oppinion, be open to criticism, your game is not all bad... ok its bad. 2/10 tops bad. Drop the ridiculous requirement, fix the tutorial and explanation of how game works, and let some other people OTHER THEN CONSUMERS playtest this. I came to have a good time not tell you how to do your job.

This game is great at training you to make the best of the resources at hand.\n+ There's a good range of both abilities, but also items (/dwarves) that can counter those abilities. It leaves many opportunities to turn the game by moving your most crucial assets around, extinguishing fires, pumping out water, etc.\n\nCons:\n- Not very original music, gets annoying quite fast (which is of course entirely subjective)\n- No options menu whatsoever (including the possibility to turn off the music (I'm looking at you, devs)).\n- Unfortunately, the multiplayer seems to be abandoned. It is probably best reccomended to play the game with some friends, since (even with the randomized aspects), after some time, I can imagine it will get a bit repetitive.\n- Fires will ♥♥♥♥ you up.\n\nAll in all, I recommend the game for those of you who likes having to deal with the worst situation the best you can. With the missing options and died out multiplayer, I would normally not recommend it, but at the price of 2,99, it still have had more than enough replay value to make it worth my while.\n\n//First review.

With simple gameplay and a small price, you will likely not be disappointed by it. While the gameplay is pretty good, and if you grab a friend you can have a good time together, it's not that big of a game that you can keep playing it over and over\n\nThe gameplay is simple and mostly intuitive. Build stuff, avoid getting wrecked, and sling spells at the opponent. The few issues are mostly ones that are a comfort issue. A lack of quick ways to select rooms and spells(The menu shows numbers, yet pressing number buttons on my keyboard does nothing, for some reason), and issues of being able to see just what is going on. Not the inteligence gathering way, that is, as you have spells and a room that help you identify rooms in your opponent's tower, but rather that as your tower is in front of your opponent's tower, your attacks will hit and the camera is trying to look at the action, but instead just zooms in on your own tower.\nFor some reason the screen goes completely black and shows only white text - quite a contrast with the normal bright sky behind your tower, and pretty annoying if you dont have mana or library/worker space. I'm not sure how that got through any sort of playtesting. At the same time, the options menu is severely lacking. They very clearly did not spend a lot of time on usability for the player.\n\nWith the rooms and spells that you get being randomised, you may experience a mild frustration as your tower burns down and there are no firefighters coming up at all for several turns. Luckily, with doors and clever building you can usually stop or slow the fire long enough to draw into what you need.\nThe graphics, as the screenshots show, are nothing to write home about. But they're functional and show you exactly what you need to know. The music is selected pretty well and overall it's a pretty good experience to play Dwarf Tower\n\nThat said, it is cheap, and it is small. Don't expect a huge game here, or a challenging AI to outsmart you. But if you grab a copy or two pack and share with a friend you can have a pretty good time for a few hours and get your money's worth","December 26, 2015","true","12.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

You are basically trying to build your archmage tower while at the same time trying to destroy your rival's and keep them from destroying yours. Interesting dynamics involved in figuring out how you want to build your tower and also in managing your spells and mana to cast spells.\n\nYou are given a random selection of cards each round, which you must use or lose. The cards are the spells, rooms, and tools that you need to build up your tower and your attack (and defense) capabilities. The spells are put in your library inventory until you use them, which requires mana points, which accumulate from crystals you build. (One thing that I would like to be able to do is remove spells from libraries. It can happen that you put a spell in there and later lack the space for a better spell available.)\n\nI had some confusion at first how to play, but I gradually realized how the play is broken into segments. While it is obvious when you enter Build or Combat phase that it is time to build or attack, some of the sub-segments weren't so obvious: for example, that "Pumping" was to assign some dwarves with this capability instead of actually pumping water out of a dungeon at that time. I think the game would be a lot more accessible to new players if there was a clearer demarcation between the segments of play, with perhaps a Help button to click on that describes what is happening in this segment of play.\n\nAll the basic information you need to play is in the game, even if it the information is presented in a manner that is a little rough around the edges. There is a tutorial that walks you through at least part of a game: my tutorial actually got stuck for some reason at some point, but I had seen enough to jump into a game. From what I did see, a little more direction from the tutorial on what is going on would be helpful.\n\nThe aesthetics of the game are simple but pleasing--I quite enjoyed the music and the simple artwork. I do kind of wish that you could see the little dwarves and archmages, especially when one of the archmages is defeated. But that is a very minor point and probably just a matter of taste on my part. (Actually it probably wouldn't work to show the archmage before the end because finding out where the archmage's quarters are is one of the points of strategy in the game.)\n\nI would definitely buy the game again after having played four rounds (each takes about ten minutes to play, I think). I can see this game as one that I come back to from time to time for a quick archmage battle.","December 24, 2014","true","1.8"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","18","35","0","9"

Not because I dislike turnbased strategy (in fact I love that, and it was the reason for me to get this game). The problem with this game is that I as a player have next to zero alternatives.\n\nEvery turn I am dealt a hand of build and attack cards (I cant edit my deck). From this hand I can chose to build some rooms (3 different kinds), fill them with furniture (crystal, dwelling, library and very rarely a mirror) and load up the build rooms with repair and attack-cards.\n\nAnd here comes the point where the game falls flat. When dealt room cards you always play them, because there is no incentive not too (as rooms are your hitpoints, due to many unaimed attacks the maxime here is "bigger is better). The furniture gives me at least a litle tactial decisionmaking, as higher / lower placed rooms are more effective (store more spells) but are prone to some spells attacking from above (lightning) or from below (flood).\n\nThe spells are a no-brainer, as you usually store them all and fire them all, because why not? There is NO incentive not to use an attack, as storeing them yields you no benefit.\n\nAll in all the game is as tactical as throwing dice. If the game gives you good attacks you win, if not you lose. Plain, simple, boring.","March 6, 2015","false","0.6"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","1"

Each turn the game randomly gives you blocks , rooms and spells to build your tower and destroy the enemy tower with. The explanation of how to play is unhelpful and it took me many games to figure it out. The way you randomly get certain items is frustrating as many times, for example, I ended up not getting a library for ages (needed to cast any spells) and the enemy just slowly killed me while I couldn't do anything. Once you do get the hang of the game, it's very easy as you only need to destroy one room of their tower to win, and... well it's just boring.\n\n(Actual playtime 30-45~ mins)","April 15, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

The tutorial is quickly useless because it tells you to make a move that you can't make, and you can't skip past that part. There are little annoyances like a lack of a volume control and a user interface that is more complicated than it has to be. Worst of all, it's a two player game, and right now your only options are a computer opponent who is astonishingly easy to defeat once you figure out the basics or hoping that there's someone online waiting to play (and you have the perserverance to sit there watching a fullscreen window with nothing happening until someone does decide to play, as I don't think there's any special sound to alert you when a game starts, and if you alt=tab away you could miss the whole thing). The developer participates in the Steam forums, though, so hopefully he'll address these problems in an update soon,\n\nBut then there are the good things: The basic rules are somewhat easy to learn but reveal extra complexity as you play. There's the simple pleasure of setting up blocks to build your tower the way you want and the fun of knocking your opponent's blocks down. There's also strategy, including deciding whether to build defensively or to push your luck by stretching your tower out to great heights and depths in order to increase the power of the effects of the rooms you build... and thereby making an easy target to get the structure blown to bits and come tumbling down. The price is relatively inexpensive, which means even if you have to get an extra copy to give to a friend to ensure you have someone to play against it won't be too painful.\n\nAt first I didn't think I liked this game, what with the various problems mentioned above. But I ended up saying "just one more gane" over and over until I realized I had played for several hours. If they ever fix the computer opponent's programming to be more challenging it will be a great solo game, but until then you'll want to find someone else to play against, because that's when the real fun begins.","December 28, 2014","true","9.0"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","1"

For starters, there is no options menu.  There IS an in-game options menu though it is sparse, not to mention that the music toggle does not work (I had to turn the sound down/off via my desktop audio mixer).  There's also no difficulty setting, though there is a sandbox and tutorial mode to help you get acclimated to the various rooms and their abilities.  The game itself is a mix of strategy and luck as the cards (rooms/abilities) you are dealt every turn appear to be random, though you do have to give some thought as to where they should go.  Crystals provide more mana and libraries hold more spells the higher up they are placed, for example.  All in all, a great "filler" game and worth the $3...though like I said, it isn't perfect in terms of implementation and functionality.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rY3pzzc0lss","December 28, 2014","true","0.7"," 6 of 15 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","6","15","0","0"

Those are never any fun when you play by yourself but are a blast playing with others so I do feel I have been misled by the promise of a single player mode that doesn’t just exist to exist…\n…I would say avoid this game if you are only looking for a single player experience.\n\nI really don’t know what to make of Dwarf Tower as a single player game, and I cannot speak to how multiplayer mode works but I do have a few things to say about this game.\n\nHere's a gameplay video on my YouTube channel.  My confusion is apparent at times.\n\nYouTube: Dwarf Tower, Single Player, How, what & why?\n\nFirst, my issues.  How dare you, as a game developer, force Facebook likes out a consumer (someone who paid for your product) to access to functionality with in a game.  There are all kinds of wrong in this, and I don’t feel I need to go into the 'why', as this should be obvious.  All I have to say about this is ‘I hope you enjoy your meaningless, dishonestly obtained likes’.  Facebook likes should be gained on their own merit.\n\nSecond, the single player game is almost pointless.  The only challenge is to figure out what is going on. A broken tutorial, that left me no choice but to restart the application, was not any help.  I played through that tutorial twice and was lost until I figured out why it was broken.\n\nOnce you have figured out the game mechanics you just can’t lose against the computer, and when you do win there is no level up, no new challenge and no improved computer player to test your skills and tower against. It’s all gone. Start again.\n\nI really don’t see any re-playability in the single player mode of Dwarf Tower.\n\nOn a more positive note, I think multiplayer mode may provide more of a challenge and more entertainment value.\n\nIf I were to make some suggestions that may improve the single player experience they would be:\n\nA good game goes somewhere.  This is not the case in Dwarf Tower.  Start the game again after loss or a win. It would be nice to continue play in my newly constructed tower, maybe against a stronger or more capable enemy.\n\nA good game teaches the player how to play while playing the game.  Levels would help here.  As a level one tower builder I would only get a limited number of pieces to work with. Once I have defeated the computer at least once, I would progress to a level two tower builder and get a few more parts to play with and so on.  The pleasure of the reward is what the gamer is looking for.\n\nIf you are going to have tutorial it should work. Swap the library and the crystal in your tutorial so I can finish it.  The single player mode demands some type of tutorial at this point and what is provided is inadequate.\n\nThere should not be a single player mode if it is going to suck. The gamer that is only looking for the single player experience is being misled. My single player experience did not make me want to play the game again and because of this an average gamer may never even try multiplayer mode.\n\nRemove the tie-in to your Facebook account.  Enough said!!\nThis game reminds me of old paper and dice games. Those are never any fun when you play by yourself but are a blast playing with others so I do feel I have been misled by the promise of a single player mode that doesn’t just exist to exist.  The developer has responded to a few Steam reviews to say that there are plans for a ‘true solo mode with a story’ depending on the reception of the game, but as things stand now, I would say avoid this game if you are only looking for a single player experience.\n\nMy recommendation is purely based on the possibilities of the multiplayer mode.\n\nGameFace","December 29, 2014","true","1.2"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","5","14","0","0"

You both build towers, use spells, and try to destroy eachother's archmage chambers.\n\nGameplay is an interesting turnbased strategy and physics gameplay.  No floating pieces of your tower unless they're connected to a levitronus.  Use doors and armor to keep out fire and flooding.  Fire spreads through your tower if it can, destroying anything and everything in it's path, so you need firefighters or doors.  Various other neat things.\n\nThe facebook integration that was there in the initial release DID kind of tick me off, but it has since been removed, letting me make this one of the *few* games where I would give a full 10/10.\n\nThe tutorial is pretty nice and decently explains the game, and the sandbox mode is nice for experimenting with building styles to see how they hold up to various attacks.  The music in use is some of Kevin MacLeod's awesome work, even if they couldn't get some custom music from him.\n\nOverall, would give 10/10.\n\nAlso, just going to get this out of the way so I don't need to copy/paste a response everywhere: I was going mad on the reviews initially because the amount of people bashing the game for the same things, and not seeing that these things they were bashing it for were going to be removed the next update had me worried.  Given that the game got stupid amounts of negativity at launch, I was terrified it wouldn't make it to a stable point on Steam's stores.\n\nAnd no, for those who are wondering, I am NOT related to the developers.  I'm just some guy who saw a little indie gem arrive on Steam, that I had been with for a bit of it's Steam Greenlight days, and I didn't want it to self-destruct because of a buggy launch.\n\nThat will be all...","December 24, 2014","true","1.4"," 15 of 38 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","15","38","0","0"

To do this you have to store spells and dwarf actions and use them to break the enemy tower or fix your own. I found this game fun and although it is a bit repetitive, it was well worth the $3.\n\nBasically this game is about locking yourself in your room and forcing librarians and dwarves to do your bidding.

Quick to pick up, and it's pretty addicting. It's a shame there aren't more game modes, or bonuses such as how many cards you can earn each round. An endless mode, as well as competing against several opponents (at least AI), would be great!","November 21, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Takes a few plays to work out what's going on, but is pretty clean and simple once you get your head around it. Long-term play value isn't high if all you want to try and do is beat the computer, but the fun lies in attempting to complete achievements, as it forces you to try and play in a manner that's not solely focussed on winning at all costs, which is frequently a harder thing to do, and that gives it more longevity than it would otherwise have.","December 11, 2015","true","14.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
