"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelonesoldier/recommended/410570/","thelonesoldier","Cyrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelonesoldier/","188 products in account","This Vive-exclusive edition of Gunjack was not designed for the Vive and is not enjoyable as a result. Instead of using the controllers to aim, you aim with your head. The only thing you do with the controllers is press the triggers, which makes the "Vive-exclusive" nature of this game a joke, since it would have worked just as well with a mouse or a keyboard or anything that had two buttons on it.\n\nAiming with your head is not fun. The turret follows your head movement, so all you do is look at things and press the trigger. What makes this more offensive is that in the opening cinematic for each level, you have free look as your character reaches forward to grasp two control arms that you think are going to be represented by the controllers. The cinematic implies you can aim the turret with your arms while looking around with your head. Nope, the turret is glued to your head and your arms do nothing.\n\nAiming with your head is not fun. I'll be taking a refund on this one, and won't try it again unless they add a proper control setup. This is a shameless cash grab, and charging $10 for a Galaxy Gear game with no actual Vive features is ridiculous.","April 6","false","0.2"," 86 of 102 people (84%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","84","86","102","3","3"

The aim is guided by head movement, and it simply does not meet my expectations of what VR should be.\n\nI will be refunding this game. For $3 it could be nice, but I won't pay a full $10 for this experience.","April 8","false","0.1"," 35 of 47 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","35","47","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/aqtrans/recommended/410570/","aqtrans","::EsG:: aq.trans","http://steamcommunity.com/id/aqtrans/","421 products in account","Not recommending this game solely because although it says "Tracked motion controllers", the game is 100% head-tracked, and it only uses the triggers primarily. Although the head tracking is pretty great, definitely not what I went in expecting.\n\nAll that being said, it is a very fun game! The head tracking is spot on, and does make sense for the setting. It also looks pretty great.\n\nOne minor issue I had was the intro cutscene gave me my first disorienting VR experience. When it went through the tiny spaceship compartments, that set off a bit of my claustrophobia as well, which was somewhat unsettling, but that doesn't last very long.\nTo the devs: I'd recommend reevaluating the current intro scene. Give us some frame of reference, a ship or suit at least.","April 8","false","0.2"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

I know this is VR and the immersion is nice, but the gameplay doesn't bring anything new to the table. Especially considering this is made by CCP, I would expect way more, like switching to other turrets on the ship or some sort of really great storyline or some other interactions beyond look and shoot. It would be okay for under $5 or as a free promotion for Eve, but as a standalone game it's just not worth it.","April 9","false","0.5"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

After reading a few reviews and looking it up on Youtube, I purchased Gunjack just for the fun of blasting spaceships to pieces while sitting in a turret.\n\nThe first thing, though, that really, really bugs me is that the player avatar model is MUUUCH TOO BIG! This is a freaking giant sitting in a gigantic seat with gigantic arms... WTF? Guys - resize that whole thing at least TWICE to make real feeling dimensions.\n\nUnfortunately that really breaks the immersion for me. Everything else is really fun and so... ;-) I mean headaiming really works well, you get to shoot waves of enemies and are defending "your ship's sector".\n"Yes, Sir, I can do that!"\n\nBut how good is a VR game, that breaks the immersion? Well ... NOT!\n\nCCP - this is something you can do better! You get a "C-", now be seated and OVERWORK YOUR PIECE!\n\nIf size is proper and I get the immersion for actually sitting in that gun turret, This would really, really be a nice casual shooter for VR!","May 22","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not sure how long it will work for, but with SteamVR and Oculus SDK 0.8, it's probably one of the most fun 'demo' type games I've played.

Targeting with the VIVE HMD is flawless. Initially I was concerned that I could not see the controllers, but you realize very quickly that there is no need to see them. The story line, narration and game play has me hooked. It also earned itself a permanent spot in my VIVE demo loop.","April 6","true","17.5"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

It's definitely worth a play but you will likely finish the entire game in 3 hours so take that into account when looking at the price.","April 9","true","0.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It's head-tracking, yes. This was originally? a gearvr title, or at least it was when I played it at Eve Vegas. So me knowing while going in that not much may have changed I was really happy with the experience. If you do not want a seated/standing trigger only head movement game this is not for you. However in terms of game play it has the arcadey style you would expect from something originally on a phone. Still highly recommend it to any eve players as well until Valkyrie is launched, so far have seen a purifier and dramiel and I know there was an abaddon when I played it at eve Vegas.","April 9","true","0.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Really well done and super fun.   Between steam reviews and comments on reddit, there are a lot of people who were saying gunjack is just a crappy gear VR port. I REALLY liked it though. Yes, it sucks that the motion controllers are only used to pull triggers but that game is straight up ultra VR galaga with friggin missles and 'sploshins! Super fun!\nI think that yeah, $10 is maybe a little much but I'm glad to give some money to devs willing to invest in VR so meh.\n\nOne concern though.  Why doesn't this game Disable Chaperone?  If you're sitting at your desk chaperon always turns on. Do you have to fully turn it off? Games like Elite Dangerous disable chaperon which is smart. I have to scoot my chair to the middle of the room which is really annoying.\n\nIs there an option to turn this off for seated games like this?","May 17","true","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Smithfield","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smithfield/","1072 products in account","Store page has been edited after this review was posted. I answered the initial thread because Gunjack Store page made no mention of being playable with/without VR. - See comment for detailsI bought it and NO, it wont launch without a VR headset plugged as well (Vive). The game actually refuses to launch if it does not detect the Vive: “This game requires a valid VR HMD to run.” When I saw Solo Player + Full Controller support + Windows (and nothing special in Recommended System Requirements section + being a port from Samsung Gear VR for Galaxy’s smartphones). I thought it would work without VR Headset [like many VR capable games in the Steam Store!] and offers a rails experience close to Titanfall...\nI can ask a refund but Hey CCP, I expect no less from you but an update to enable a VR-free versioneven if it has to hurt gameplay… please :)","April 5","true","0.3"," 35 of 81 people (43%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","43","35","81","7","6"
