To expect great things from the game, and to be disappointed when those expectations are not met, is quite normal. When judgement is rendered solely on the result of those expectations, the fatal mistake is made. It in turn leads to a propensity for jumping to conclusions, and from that point it's a rapid descent into ignorance.\n\nBack when Fallout 4 was released, most of the Steam reviews consisted of incoherent, furious ranting that tarnished the whole title after only a few hours worth of gameplay. After being shocked by the overwhelming amount of negativity, I decided to make my own and openly condemned the bad reviews for what they were: baseless and devoid of perspective. It was quite obvious the authors made that fatal mistake, which is unfair to the many developers who put their soul and passion into creating the game.\n\nIn the end, Fallout fans will almost assuredly find disappointments with Fallout 4, as did I. But if the ignorance of the older reviews and reception of previous games ought to teach one thing, it's that those disappointments are no excuse for blind judgement or jumping to conclusions. If an opinion is to be rendered of this game in the form of review, let it be guided by reason and supported by logic. It is in the pursuit of that fairness and clarity that I chose to write this review.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nFallout 4 is a deeply enjoyable and well-crafted game.  However, it definitely has its issues. Bethesda tried new things in this title, some more ambitious than others, and not all of them were successful.\n\nIt's true that dialogue has been watered down as the devs chose to forgo text conversation choices in favor of a voiced and much more simplified dialogue wheel, which is further hampered by boring choices and weak voice work. Character advancements have been combined into a single perk/SPECIAL sheet. Settlement building, while certainly fun, is mostly aesthetic filler that has little impact on the game world. Side quests far too often amount to just killing some mandatory enemies, particularly with the Minutemen (who are supposed to be the "good guys" of this installment), and can become repetitive.\n\nMy most prominent grievance with Fallout 4 is the dialogue overhaul and removal of the karma system, which was completely unnecessary and not desired by a single player in existence. Unlike the previous flaws, this thoroughly irks me. I realized that this ties in to the primary weakness of Fallout 4: its lack of meaningful dialogue in comparison to most Bethesda titles. Far too often, your dialogue choices are short, shallow, meaningless, or all three.\n\nThe only choices that have any outcome are blatantly outlined as persuasion options, a lot of which only help you get some extra caps. It's not that you should be making major decisions all the time; the problem is that you, as a speaking character, now have a voice that carries no power. What you decide to say is almost always inconsequential. The dialogue system is highly reminiscent of Mass Effect except watered down; the reason it doesn't work in Fallout is that the two games have totally different approaches to conversation. The previous Fallout games had much better dialogue options because they meant something. Sometimes, your choice of words just made someone hate you, allowed you to entice or inspire others, or developed your reputation through the karma system. Now that karma is gone, your choices are just that much more pointless.\n\nThe bottom line is that Bethesda sacrificed a tremendous amount of RPG dialogue elements to accommodate full voice-work. While it was an ambitious attempt, it was an all-around mistake and it sticks out like a sore if you're a fan of Bethesda games or RPG's in general. The dialogue wheel system could have worked out just fine, but Bethesda carried it out in the wrong way.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nAll the aforementioned flaws are some of the most central complaints naysayers have about Fallout 4 and yet not a single one of them has been horrific enough to ruin my experience or let me down. Despite the few bugs I've come across, despite the certain questionable and sometimes idiotic design choices Bethesda made here, this game is still extremely well done. I still feel that incomparable thrill that only Fallout can bring.\n\nEven though Fallout 4 falls extremely short on dialogue and all aspects associated with it, it's still an improvement over its predecessors in almost every other way imaginable. The game suffers some graphical issues like muddy textures and poor lighting at times, like any good Bethesda game, but it's still astoundingly beautiful and even breathtaking at times. Movement, melee, gunplay, and physics are better and smoother than they've ever been.\n\nPeople were quick to judge the Commonwealth map based on its size and I was prepared to be disappointed as well, but it's surprisingly the best one Bethesda has whipped up thus far. The suburban locations are more organically dispersed and things become more compressed as you near the cities. Streets are narrow, buildings are tall, and locations are absolutely jam-packed alongside a ton of unmarked ruins and buildings you can enter. There are hardly any copy-pasted environments and they all show great attention to detail.\n\nI was also worried that granting access to power armor and a minigun within the first thirty minutes of the game would be a huge balancing issue as well, but it really isn’t. Power armor relies on uncommon fusion cores for power and you’re not an unstoppable god while wearing the suit, especially not at higher difficulties or levels. You can acquire some strong weapons like the minigun or Fatman relatively early but finding sufficient ammo is another matter entirely.\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nSkyrim was a simplification of the Oblivion formula, but it was still a fantastic game. In much the same way, Fallout 4 is a simplification of the Fallout 3/New Vegas formula and is still extremely good. Even in light of its issues, this game has not been a disappointment at all. RPG elements can be enhanced through the wonderful modding community and will eventually make up for some of the game's weaker points, a perk of the PC version. Bethesda has, however, been on a recent trend of simplifying their games too much and I hope they change course.\n\nTruthfully, the negative Steam reviews had me partly worried that I’d be disappointed but I chose to disregard them and arrive at my own opinion. I’ve learned that nearly every point of contention was blown out of context. The few issues that haven’t been redeemed in my eyes still pale in the face of the tremendous work that was done to bring this new and beautiful Fallout world to life. I have no doubt that the naysayers worked up their expectations to heights beyond reason, and it’s therefore no mystery that they hit the ground so hard afterwards. I chose to see Fallout 4 for what it is rather than what I expected or imagined it to be: a lovingly crafted game that, despite being marred by some of its shortcomings, has that same engaging splendor that far supercedes its flaws.\n\nI highly recommend you try the game and approach it with a neutral and reasonable demeanor, and you won’t be disappointed.\n\n----------------------------------------\nEDIT\nI'm grateful that so many people have found this review helpful and I'd like to thank you all for commenting. I can't reply to everyone's comments but I've certainly read every one of them.\n\nI hope that my review has given you some useful perspective, either good or bad.\n\nEDIT #2\nReworked the intro to be less confrontational, as it was no longer needed.

Thanks to everybody who rated it helpful or not and thanks to everybody for commenting. I'll respond to any comments posted here or my profile. I also changed my final score of the game in order to clear up some confusion.\n\nOk, now that I've got 100 hours exactly on this game, I'm going to do an updated thoughts list. This isn't a full review, just a list of observations.\n\nPros\n\n- The game is really pretty. Compared to the other two 3D Fallout games, it's quite colorful.\n\n- The FPS part of the game is greatly, greatly improved. The guns feel like they have power. The explosives actually work. Melee feels like Skyrim.\n\n- The story is interesting. Certainly not the best, but it had a few twists and turns I didn't see coming.\n\n- Power armor is quite cool. I think they did this really well. It's more like a vehicle that needs fuel and maintenance unlike the last games where it was just an outfit.\n\n- Crafting. You can create many things including mods for your weapons, armor and power armor. You can also craft medicines and drugs.\n\n- All the clutter is useful. Pick up all the junk.\n\n- I loved the updated looks of the various wasteland creatures. Mirelurks, Super mutants, deathclaws etc.\n\n- Common low level enemies pose a threat. Even the lowly bloatfly can have a legendary mutation and will do a lot of damage.\n\n- Generally less buggy. I've only had a few annoying bugs. Less than I imagined for a game of this size and complexity.\n\n- Mods. Bethesda games have always been very moddable and this one is no different.\n\n- Armor layer system. It's pretty cool to have a base outfit, then a piece of armor for every part of the body. However, by about 60 hours playtime I'd already had gotten the best armors and haven't found an upgrade since.\n\n\nNeutrals\n\n- It runs really well...when you aren't in the city. I get a solid 60fps outside of the city but once I venture in it drops to 30 or less. I've seen a mod that might help with that but I have yet to use it. Also, zooming in with a scope drops my fps as well.\n\n- Voice acting is surprisingly good so most characters. A few feel like they have zero personality while others genuinely feel alive.\n\n- Exploration. There is lots to see and lots to find. You'll be wandering through lots of underground tunnels and ruined buildings. It all starts feeling same-y after a while.\n\n- This game doesn't feel like a true successor to Fallout 3 and NV. It just doesn't have the feeling of a true Fallout game. It feels like a Fallout-themed FPS. What it does, it does well. But I think it's focused to much on the FPS and not enough on the RPG. Todd Howard said it was an RPG with FPS elements but to me it feels like the opposite, an FPS with light RPG elements.\n\n- Removal of skills and casualization. In NV, there were plenty of times where I could use my medicine skill to fix (or kill) a person, use my repair skill to fix machinery or even use my skill level to pass a speech check. None of this is possible in F4, and none of that depth is there. The world feels much less alive.\n\n- Voiced Protagonist. This is the big one for me. I feel as though the game was built around the protagonist having a voice. Because they needed to record so many voice lines, they sacrificed features of the game, mainly skills. If they still had skills, they'd have had to record so much more dialogue for speech checks. Voiced protagonist also limits the amount of variation the story can have, again because that would involve more recording. See where I'm going with this?\n\n- The storyline operates similarly to Mass Effect. You can't be a truly evil ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like in the previous two games, but you can be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ along the way. You will always be a hero.\n\n- Settlement building. I would have put this under pros but it just lacks depth. It's neat but it brings a bunch of hassles. Your settlements need stuff to thrive. They are often being attacked or have some issue. I wanted to build an amazing base, not babysit 50 settlements.\n\n- Removal of the karma system. Sometimes, it was good being bad. In 3 and NV, being good or bad had it's pros and cons. With this game there is no such thing and thus a layer of depth is removed from the game. The closest thing is that your companions may like or dislike certain actions.\n\n- Removal of weapon and armor maintenance. Some people like it. I don't. It removes a layer of depth to the gameplay and makes all those guns and armor you find useless.\n\n- Caps (money) is less useful in this game. You'll find all you need on your adventures, especially if you have the loot perks from the Luck tree. I had over a 1000 .50 sniper rounds before I ever found a .50 rifle for instance. There are a few nice items in shops but they aren't needed.\n\n- Lockpicking is copied from Skyrim. While I'd like to have seen something new, at least I already know how to work this minigame. I've always thought that Oblivion had the best lockpicking system.\n\n- Computer hacking is the same as 3 and NV. I never learned how to properly do it. I just guess words over and over until I get through. At least in this game, you can't be totally locked out.\n\nCons\n\n- The game is a blatant console port.\n\n- Crappy, controller designed UI. Since there are only 4 options in dialogue, this limits interactions options and removes depth.\n\n- Story spoiler: After the end of the story, you can't lead whatever faction you sided with. They just...exist and call you the leader. They stop advancing their goals.\n\n\n- After the story, you are just given repetitive settlement babysitting quests. I've stopped caring.\n\n- Little replayability. Because of the lack of depth there aren't many roads to go down and the destinations are all the same.\n\n- Less weapon variety than NV. By about 70 hours I had found all the base varieties of guns and had most of them modded the way I wanted. Haven't picked up a weapon since.\n\n- Non-story quests are just go here, talk to person. Maybe shoot them. There have been a few interesting encounters but it all feels like busywork. This game is actually worse than Skyrim about this since there aren't many different ways to do it because all the depth has been removed.\n\n- Power Armor doesn't work as expected. I expected it to absorb damage, then break. Once a piece breaks, you start taking damage to that area. However how it actually works is just another layer of armor. If you take damage, then you just take less damage, the armor doesn't absorb it all till it runs out of hp.\n\n- But this biggest gripe I have is...\n\nLack.\n\nOf.\n\nDEPTH!!!!\n\nSeriously, they took 70% of what makes a Fallout game Fallout and threw it away in favor of casualization (to appeal to a bigger audience and thus increase sales) and more SHOOTY ACTION. As a shooter, this game is really good. As a Fallout game, it falls flat on it's face.\n\nMy final score: 6.5/10. Fun combat, decent gear and character customization, lots of exploring and collecting. Settlement building. Lack of depth as expected from a Fallout title is the biggest flaw.","November 28, 2015","true","302.3"," 4,395 of 5,393 people (81%) found this review helpful 206 people found this review funny","81","395","5","206","238"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/arcticdemolition/recommended/377160/","arcticdemolition","Arctic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/arcticdemolition/","266 products in account","I've logged a couple hundred hours in both Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas.  After putting in around 20 hours into Fallout 4, my opinion can be summed up as follows: great game, terrible port, with a few misguided attempts at innovation.\n\nPros:\n+ Fantastic character customization.  Even without more detailed controls, the system allows for truly unique looking characters.\n+ Great characterization.  I've frequently heard people claim characters are "bland" and "boring", but those that I've run in to so far have been anything but.  I think that this opinion stems from the first few hours of the game, when you're first getting a feel for things.  Preston Garvey is admittedly pretty bland, as well as the inhabitants of every tiny settlement until you reach the edge of Boston.  Once you start getting into the nitty gritty of it, you'll find some charming characters.\n+ Good AI, improved companion AI.  This is another point of contention.  I've seen people complain that the AI is bad, but in my experience, it's above average when compared to most other AAA titles these days, and leaps ahead of where Bethesda was with Skyrim and the previous Fallout.  Enemies make frequent use of cover, attempt to flank, etc.  Companions position themselves to accurately fire down at people.  I've had very few issues so far.\n+ Amazing gun/armor customization.  Glad they added in layered armoring.\n+ Music.  Great song choice, cool radio station, funny announcer (though I do hope he'll actually tie into a quest at some point).  Non-radio music is also great.\n+ Environment and Level Design.  Very pleased with how it turned out.  Plus, the increased amount of outer-cell and vertical-gameplay oriented areas makes me very happy.\n\n\nContested:\n= Dialogue.  I don't like the four-button system, and I don't like the whole "color indicated difficulty" with speech checks.  I very much prefer a flat threshold.  That said, the dialogue is fluid, the multi-person conversations are a refreshing addition, and I can't bring myself to outright dislike this.\n= Bugs.  This is probably the most bug-free Bethesda release I've ever seen, not counting the problems associated with Gamebryo or the game's status as a mediocre port.  Still, the bugs are there, and they are occasionally jarring.  Every major release should expect some bugs, and Fallout 4 seems about average for the games industry rather than for Bethesda's historically poor track record.\n= Story.  I can take it or leave it, which may be better to take as a bad sign.  If this game were linear, this would be a major downer.\n\nCons:\n- Controls.  Jesus, the control scheme is bad.  UI is terrible.  This was a case of people reassigning keys to be used on the PC rather than giving it the attention is deserves.  This is probably the worst of it.  With a decent UI, almost half the problems with the game would instantly disappear.\n- Voiced Protagonist.  Ties in with the above.  Personally, I find the voice actors did great jobs doing this, but it still doesn't fit, and completely removes the ability for me to make a character of my own, which was a large part of the appeal.  I can't get wrapped up in this character's problems.  I can't bring myself to care about his/her plight on the Earth.  I think this is mostly a matter of poor execution.  A voiced protagonist would work fine if they also managed to keep the character's motivations ambiguous, and not have it so heavily reliant on a preestablished backstory.\n- They dumbed down the "RP" in "RPG".  It's now an FPSrpG.  I want my perk/skill based dialogue checks back.  I want there to be moral chocies that shape how my character is seen.  I want there to be a karma meter that shows how I'm perceived in the wasteland.\n- Gamebyro and all of the issues associated with it.\n- Terrible PC options.  You'll have to go directly into the preferences & initialization files to change things like mouse acceleration and FOV.\n- No holstered weapons.  This irks me more than it should.  (Clarification: I meant that when a weapon is holstered, you can't see it on the player model.)\n\nNot Rated:\n~ Performance.  I have a very high end system, so I can't speak as to how nicely this runs on budget machines, but I've heard good things.\n\nI may revisit this and add more with my updated thoughts as I progress.","November 11, 2015","true","112.8"," 5,330 of 6,996 people (76%) found this review helpful 201 people found this review funny","76","330","6","201","210"

So all I REALLY care about is content)\n\nBut it has some Pros\n-Basebuilding was kind of a neat thing, able to build your own settlements, defend them. Something to yourself into\n-Shooter aspects of it are MUCH more polished then ever before. Very clean satisfying shooting better then NV\n-POWER ARMOR! Feels so amazing in this game, love love LOVE what they did with it, makes it feel significant, not just another armor set\n-More voice work made it a bit interesting to listen to people and characters, especailly a voice protaganist\n-Graphically it looks much better then previous fallout games, unless you're running a lot of mods in NV\n\nNow it's Cons\n\n-RPG elements have been reduced down to perk points, not even your base stats matter for much, and many of the perks don't do much interesting. Nothing like "wild wastelands" in NV where it literally changed stuff you saw in the game\n\n-Settlements felt very tacked on, a lot of things you didn't even know you could do like linking settlements together. Not to mention if you build them up a bit, it's almost impossible for raiders to do much damage at all and you don't feel any worry about somewhere being attacked.\n\n-Non choice choices. Piper, first time you meet her and try to tell her no I don't want to help, you have to do it anyways. Support the press or not, the mayor always lets you in, Piper is always willing to take bullets for you after. And Many many other times when you try to choice but it just defaults you back to what they want out of the dialog, didn't feel like choices were being made in a lot of cases\n\n-Exploration just turns into shoot everything almost all the time. Ya the combat zone? Remember how we wanted to fight in a ring, and there were files found that would let us be a gladiator? nope instead we walk in, everyone shoots at you, kill everything, get Cait..... that's it\nI did find a few interesting places, but why can't I interact with people more? They say the Gunners are "MERCS" well why can't I hire them? Do some quests with them? I could sell chems to raiders in NV. Gunners just shoot on sight\n\n-Preston is the best example of how this game's quests boil down to for the majority of the time, go here shoot stuf, come back, go there shoot more stuff come back....\nI will admit there are some decent interesting quests, but they all just devolve into "shoot stuff" go back reward. It feels so on rails, no variation. No replayablity. Same ending to almost any quest.\nA growing trend in bethesda games. How many times can you finish the dark brotherhood questline in skyrim before it loses all it's charm for you knowing what's going to happen?\n\n------------------------------\nThe game just feels so lack luster the more you dive into it. Start to notice how repeditive and lack of any variation, like Angry Joe said "more of the same" for the most part.\nAnd it sucks because I'm probably not going to buy a new Bethesda open world game (ya not going to call it an RPG, it's an open world shooter) if bethesda just does more of the same.\nAnd we NEED to be more willing to critize games, instead of religiously defending them. Because without critism, we lose our control as the consumers over what we want from the market.\nAnd while it's really late to write this review, hopefully people will look at reviews like to help influence the market from cutting corners like in this game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEdit: Btw's anyone else tried to steal a bunch of stuff from the BoS or any NPC town?\nAnd then right after you come out of sneaking they all just instantly turn on you? Happens everytime I tried to steal more then 3-5 items or so? Everyone just knew I was the one that stole something. And there's always industructable characters everywhere that you can't stop fighting forever so I have to reload the save. I can't even be a thief in this game :/\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEdit, Edit: No I'm not saying this is such a bad game that you are bad for liking it. I'm just warning people going into it wanting all the things promised are in for a huge let down. It's still a good shooter game on it's own, but I'm just trying to write this in the hopes people will be more warry of hype promises to what is actually in the game.\nTrying to help break fanboyism of religiously defending games and allowing game companies cut corners in quality.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArchiduxAdams/recommended/377160/","ArchiduxAdams","Otto von Bismarck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ArchiduxAdams/","95 products in account","This game is very hard to review. It somehow manages to have an endless amount of things to do, while having absolutely nothing to do and being extremely bored because of it. It's impressive really. To make this simple I'll make a section of pros and cons and have a write up for each feature I like or dislike.\n\nPROSCombat\nThe combat in Fallout 4 is smooth, fun, and interesting.  There are literally hundreds of ways to kill your enemies in any variety of fashions. Improvements on enemy AI make each enemy unique, from ghouls lunging at you, deathclaws bobbing and weaving around your bullets, or raiders riposting your melee attacks. The enemies are smarter. They also actually use cover now. VATS is still as good as ever. Reliable damage with a percentage chance to hit. You can also sprint now by using AP, a feature that was actually a New Vegas mod. Easily the best combat out of all of the Fallout games by far, ignoring 1&2 as it wouldn't be fair to compare the first games.\n\nThe World\nThe post apocalyptic Boston Commonwealth is a fantastic place to explore. Several famous landmarks are present, the historic feeling the city of Boston actually has is portayed well, and it's absolutely giant. There are a massive amount of things to find in the world. There are hundreds of marked locations and an uncountable amount of unmarked ones as well. If you enjoy aimlessly exploring, you'll love this game.\n\nCrafting Systems\nThis is by far my absolute favorite improvement Bethesda brought with Fallout 4. The new overhauled crafting system is spectacular. You can create any number of combinations for weapons, allowing you to build the perfect weapon for you. For example, let me talk about the combat rifle. You can turn the combat rifle into a bolt action sniper, or a full auto SBR, and anything inbetween. The mix-and-match system for upgrades is absolutely grand because it allows you to fine tune your weapons to be a perfect fit for your character and playstyle. You can also customize armor, although it's not as exciting. The most you can really do is upgrade your stats. You can also customize your power armor, but we'll touch on that later. The new crafting system also makes junk loot usefull. By scavenging random junk that would of been useless in previous Fallout games, you can scrap them for materials and parts to build other items. Find a cooking tray? Useless junk right? Nope. Melt that baby down and build a new reciever for your shotgun. The settlement building is also great. It's essentially Fallout: Minecraft edition, which is great by me. The only problem is it can start feeling a little game-y managing resources and such. It's fine overall though. It you like building like I do, this part is really, really cool.\n\nPower Armor\nThe power armor in this game is, if you'll excuse my language, ♥♥♥♥ing awesome. In previous Fallout titles, power armor was simply another regular set of armor that gave the best stats. Not in Fallout 4. Power armor is closer to a vehicle, like a mech suit, in Fallout 4. You climb into your power armor and instantly become an unkillable hulking beast powered by fusion cores. Oh yeah, power armor isn't powered by microfusion cells anymore. It's powered by fusion cores. Fusion cores are essentially nuclear batteries. You can find them scattered around the wasteland in random places. No fusion cores, no power armor. Don't worry though, you probably won't run out. The crafting system for power armor is equally awesome. You can fully customize your power armor with different upgrades ranging from a VATS computer inside the helmet, to electric fists, to a DAMN JETPACK! You can also paint your armors all different kinds of colors. If you have an idea of a cool suit, you can make it. Also, you can mix and match power armor pieces. Want X-01 arms, T-51b torso and helmet, and T-60 legs? Go for it, because you can, although having full X-01 will allways be more efficient, but harder to repair.\n\nCONSQuests and Content\nAfter finishing the main quest, which is decent at best, you have almost nothing to do. There are a few choice quests that stand out such as the USS constitution's quest or the Museum of Witchcraft, but apart from that the game is extremely lacking. A side effect of this is once you finish the main quest, there is no content left. The game becomes boring. You're left with the crafting system and settlement building. If that's enough to keep you occupied, you might be able to stretch Fallout 4 for a bit longer, but you'll eventually become bored. The game suffers heavily for having nothing to do, despite being one of the biggest open world games ever released. There are so many places to explore but nothing to actually DO. It's the Fallout equivalent of having a cake but not being able to eat it. There are a ton of cool places like the Combat Zone and the Robot Race Track where there could be interesting or unique interactions, but they're just more raider shooting galleries. You're probably only going to get ~80 hours out of the game if you're an average gamer, over 100 if you try and stretch it. By starting with a new character and siding with different factions OR if for some reason you're okay just aimlessly exploring, you could probably get ~150.\n\nWriting and Player Character\nThe writing in this game is just pretty bad. Apart from being cliché, predictable, convoluted, and not really giving you an actual reason to care, it limits your roleplaying potential. In previous Fallout games, you were in complete control of your character's personality, traits, opinions, etc. In Fallout 4, you are a semi-goody two shoes no matter what you do. This is a side effect of both the voiced protagonist and the 4 dialog option. The game will direct your character on rails the entire game. The game lies to you by telling you you are free. Sure, you're free to go wherever, and do whatever you want, but you will complete quests the way Bethesda wants you to, or you won't complete them at all. In New Vegas, you could finish and complete quests in literally any way you want, and the game would be ready for it. Not in Fallout 4. You don't get to roleplay as the player character and make your own meaningful decisions. You're Bethesda's sole survivor and you will do as you are told.\n\nGraphics\nThe game can be pretty, and it looks good. It's not graphically impressive like The Witcher 3, and it doesn't have a fantastic aesthetic like Bioshock Infinite. It looks alright and is graphically fine. It's just 'meh' across the board. That's okay. The problem arrives the game runs like garbage. I have a GTX 770, and I have to run this game on medium-high. That's a complete joke when I can count the pixels on the rust texture that they reused on every piece of metal in the game. The game is very poorly optimized. Games like Metro Last Light, which is much more graphically impressive, and has a much better aesthetic, I can run at high-ultra WITH higher frames than on Fallout 4. Ridiculous.\n\nFinal Verdict6/10\nDon't buy this game if you want a true roleplaying experience like Fallout 1, 2, and New vegas. It's a glorified open world shooter with a perk system. It would be a sham to call it an RPG, or anything close to it. It's closer to Borderlands than Fallout. If you want an open world shooter with a solid crafting system, and you don't mind not having much content after the main story, then get this game. You'll enjoy it. If you're like me and wanted an inclusive Fallout open world RPG that was in depth and full of rich story telling and interesting characters, don't buy it. You'll only be longing for what this game could of been. Just play New Vegas with some mods. In my opinion, New Vegas is the best game in the series. Let's hope Obsidian makes another Fallout game, and takes from what Fallout 4 improved on, and makes a a great RPG.","January 27","false","96.8"," 1,898 of 2,585 people (73%) found this review helpful 93 people found this review funny","73","898","2","93","117"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053292615/recommended/377160/","76561198053292615","Fengferth","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053292615/","325 products in account","Recommended with Caution!!!\n\nUPDATED : 18/11/2015, Additions and edits are in italics\n\nIncoming wall of glorious text.\n\nTL:DR\nFallout 4 is a welcome addition to the franchise but suffers greatly by "over-extending" itself, which results in a more simplified gaming experience as opposed to the previous (Fallout 3/New Vegas) installments. Gunplay is more fast paced but SOME RPG elements have been stripped down. The new game mechanics such as the settlement base building are not implemented very well and the dialogue, while the main protagonist is now nicely voice-acted, has been "dumbed-down" due to it. The UI is cumbersome and needs improving, the optimization of the game seems fairly stella although there are unusual fps drops where there shouldn't be and the visuals aren't exactly "next-gen".\n\nCombine all that with the fact that some important keys are hard-coded and basic options, such as v-sync and mouse smoothing, have to be edited via .ini files make this game just bareable to play at times. It stands on it's own merit, but when comparing it to it's back catalogue, it is somewhat underwhelming.\n\nThe GoodGunplay has been taken up a notch, it is much more fast paced.\n\nSprinting has been added. It drains AP and gets you from point A-B quicker. Great addition for players who don't like using V.A.T.S as their AP pool is no longer "wasted".\n\nV.A.T.S has also been changed, while in V.A.T.S time slows as opposed to stopping, this not only gives a sense of urgency to act, but it can also be benefical in some circumstances. Also crits are now activated by filling up a bar which is gained by sucessfully hitting an enemy.\n\nWeapons and Armour now have an in-depth mod system, you can change nearly every aspect of a weapon, from making a longer barrel for higher damage to making an extended magazine for holding more bullets. Armour can have more padding for extra limb protection, or even additional pockets to carry more. There's even armour pieces that can be mixed at will. Bethesda did pretty damn good with this system. You can even re-name them!!! Nothing more satisfying then a "G2 Fengtender" or a "Fengcannon" ><.\n\nLegendary Loot. Some enemies will have a legendary tag maked with a star. They usually drop at least 1 legendary item which is randomized. I've found 3 so far and each have unique abilities (e.g I have a Lucky Metal Chest Piece which not only has good damage resistance, it has +2 Luck bonus).\n\nMods. There are already a ton of nice mods on the nexus, ranging from game mechanic changes to new features (including one I've been using recently, Ammo Crafting). However G.E.C.K for modders hasn't been released yet sadly :(.\nThe BadThe UI. It's just as clunky, if not actually worse, as in the previous installments. This is an indication of a console port.\n\nHard-Binds and lack of important options. Why the hell are we still getting mouse acceleration AND smoothing enabled by default in 2015 is beyond me. Thankfully some .ini file edits can fix most of the problems, however I wouldn't recommend uncapping the fps past 60, unless you want to play at double/triple game speed. Tying mouse movement and the game engine to the FPS is, quite frankly, bloody stupid. People that don't play with WASD movement will have trouble playing since most keys are hard bound. Another good indication of a console port.\n\nLoading times. Probably on my side of things, I admit, I don't have an SSD yet, but I do have a Black Edition WD HDD which is pretty fast at loading but even so the loading times are long. I can make a cup of coffee while waiting for the world to load. Confirmed (after testing with a new SSD) it IS the HDD. This is still worth noting as not everyone has access to a SSD, the load times can be anything from 20 seconds - 1 minute with the above HDD depending what's loading.\n\nRandom FPS Drops. I can run the game fine on High settings @ 1080p 60FPS, however there will be times where I get sudden drops to about 42FPS, even to 30FPS when there's nothing going on, on the screen to even cause that. This still happens with an SSD just for the record\n\nVery Early Game Power Armour. Power Armour works differently than in previous installments. Rather then putting it on like armour it is a suit that has to be interacted with. You can get it very early on (as early as 1 hour in) and is pretty useful. You do need to power it however. once it runs out of juice you're basically running walking around in heavy metal.\n\nPrevious Mechanics Have Been Scrapped. There is no more karma system, repairing is no longer a thing (except for Power Armour), you can't make your own ammo and, probably the most disappointing thing, NO HARDCORE MODE!!! It's as if Bethesda looked at Obsidian's best features in F:NV and thought "♥♥♥♥ it".\n\nThe Not So UglyVoice Acted Protagonist and Dialogue. While the voice acting is a welcome new addition, it has also simplified one of the main mechanics of the franchise, the dialogue. No more using your stats for different choices, everything dialogue related is now tied to Charisma. You only get 4 options, most of which are Yes, No, Sarcastic and Info.\n\nNo More Skills. Talking About Charisma, the RPG/leveling system has undergone a overhaul. There are no longer any skills (like Repair/Survival/Lockpick/etc). Instead leveling is tied to a perk tree which is influenced by your S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats. Every level rewards you with a point that can be spent on either increasing one of your S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats or on a perk. It's a much more simple system that some will like, others won't. A big thing to remember is that THERE IS NO LEVEL CAP!!!. Thank You Bethesda for not locking level caps behind DLC paywalls (for once :p).\n\nSettlement building. Great idea, very poor execution. No tutorial followed by a very clunky UI makes it tedious to use. The worst thing about it is that it's required (to some extent), it's one of the new main features of the game. Kuddos to Bethesda to try and bring something new to the table, but it's very hard to appreciate when it's a complete cluster♥♥♥♥ as it is now. After investing more time into the settlement building I am growing to love it and it's a nice addition. However the above still stands, the settlement building needs ALOT of QoL changes to the UI and useability.\n\nTerrain. Worth mentioning, the level design is pretty decent for most part, but again like previous installments foilage and terrain block shots. It is so annoying to know that I can see an enemy through a fence and know I can hit them through the gap and instead of getting a hitmarker I get a bullet hole 2 inchs away. I could understand this if the world was procedurally generated but it's not.\n\nBugs, Glitches and Crashes, Oh My!!! If there's one thing I've come to expect with Bethesda games it's bugs, glitches and crashes. Oddly enough I haven't come across too many as of yet, just the odd graphical glitches with weapon models, delayed weapon changing and getting stuck on some debris. After putting in some more hours I've noticed these becoming much more frequent, however I've still yet to come across a game-breaking bug. Even so many players on the forums ARE experiencing game-breaking bugs.

There is no problem with going for a voiced protagonist and restricting the available speech options to four (five if you count Speech checks which almost always boil down to "Pay me more and then Yes") if you can back that up with a solid story and good writing. Things Bethesda seem to be lacking. They give you a pathetically short intro in which they introduce you to your family, and whisk you off to a Vault. Why do I care about these people? I don't, but my character does, which leads me to my biggest problem: the lack of roleplay.\n\nYou aren't your character, just along for the ride. You can no longer play as an Evil character, or anything resembling such. Diplomacy? Out the door. Guns solve the problems now, and to their credit, the gunplay is a big step up from Fallouts 3 and New Vegas but that's not why I play these games. Gone are the days of playing as a massive idiot who solves all problems with his fists or as a Diplomat who can resolve problems by talking them out whose only skill with weapons is knowing which way to hold them. Or even a compulsive gambler. Want to tell Garvey to go screw himself? Well, you can decline but the quest will not continue until you say yes and get in the damn Power Armor. You can run away but that breaks story progression.\n\nOverall the game feels less like Fallout 4 and more like Borderlands 3 to me.\nI didn't like it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigwoodfarmer/recommended/377160/","bigwoodfarmer","BigWoodFarmer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bigwoodfarmer/","183 products in account","I really, really wanted to like Fallout4. I even took a few days off work around the release date to be able to play. I invested the time, I played two different builds to level 20+.\n\nFirstly my favorite Fallout build, the intelligent, pacifist, charismatic, scientist who tries to stay out of trouble, sneaks around and uses robots and perimeter defenses against threats. He is also able to talk himself out of most situations and is able to solve many situations peacefully while staying neutral.\n\nSecondy, I tried my vampire build, the strong, melee, cannibal woman, driven to madness by the cruel new world. She uses strong melee Weapons to tear her enemies into shreds and consumes what is left of them to replenish her life.\n\nI was able to create and play both those builds in past Fallout Games by Bethesda with great success, but now, I just can't cover up all the missing aspects of the game with role play anymore. I really needed the Karma feature for this... It was all important. I really need to define my character with certain skills builds, not just randomly be able to do everything.\n\nYes, I have played the game for 80 hours, and as I said, I really wanted to like it. But I just can't... I played new Vegas for almost 500 hours (console, PC) and can't imagine even starting up Fallout4 anymore. It just got boring really fast... I don't care about any story or characters at all. Where are the cool NPCs? Like the Doc in New Vegas or Mr. House, or Moira in Megaton? Or ThreeDog from the Radio? Now I listened to this whinny boy with low self-esteem on the radio until I get so frustrated that i actually do help him in the most underwhelming questline ever.\n\nI find myself skipping through dialogue in Fallout4 which I never used to do in Fallout 3 or Vegas. Clicked the wrong anwser while skipping dialogue? No Problem, all the answers result in the same effect anyway.\n\nSpeaking of Dialogue. I totally wasted my points in black widow / charisma. It's not necessary at all and can be totally ignored. All you are doing in Fallout4 is running from location to location killing everything. There is really no point to any other stats in the game. The could have totally reduced the SPECIAL System to SPEAL. Most dialogue has to end by your character saying yes anyway. If not, the quest will just not continue, there are no alternative ways to resolve the quests I have seen so far. The only benefit you get from high charisma / black widow (formally speech checks) is more caps for killing or getting something. Making it useless, since you will just be swimming in caps eventually anyway.\n\nI used to love hacking, reading all the information in Terminals, finding out about the World from before, I couldn't even be bothered after my 10th terminal to "Unlock Door".\n\nWhere was the tutorial? Why do I have to find out from friends that I can press ALT for different finishing Melee moves?! Explain some of the new features for me?\n\nAnd who had the brilliant idea of double binding the melee hard attack and drop explosives button? I have blown myself up more times playing a melee character then ever before, causing a lot of frustration and replay of the same areas.\n\nEssentially, it's an open world shooter with base building... Not a Role-Playing Game. And most certainly, not a Fallout.\n\n","December 7, 2015","false","77.5"," 2,900 of 4,124 people (70%) found this review helpful 171 people found this review funny","70","900","4","171","161"

(not)\n\nApparently the new targeted mass audience is too overexerted with free choice and complex dialogue options\nNPC: Will you help me?\n\nCharacter:\n\nYes\nNo (Still forced to do it)\nSarcastic (Yes)\nHuh? (Explanation that leads back to the above options)\n\nSpeech check = Yes, but for 50 caps\n\nThe FPS purpose-built overworld and quests\nNo longer is the wasteland a coherent and authentic post-apocalyptic world. In between the separated main settlements like Diamond city there's nothing more than FPS purpose-built locations, enemies and quests. There are many settlements that don't seem to be able to take care of themselves in the slightest. There are random hordes of raiders and super mutants inhabiting places that are only there so you have something to shoot at and then loot the chest located in the center. Brotherhood members have no valid patrols or outposts anymore (other than the Hub-like police station and airport base), they just spawn in random locations, attacking random locations until the moment they die. It's so freaking meaningless, only there to fullfil the purpose of making the world seemingly filled with life and action.\n\nI really don't care for these BOS members, I don't care for this dungeon-like places to explore only to find one legendary enemie and a loot chest. The world doesn't feel like a world anymore, it's just a level to explore. Also I don't care to make randomized fetch quests for generic settlers mostly without any backstory or character, like "Go there, kill that, take this, bring back". Why in the name of god should I care other than having something to shoot with my weapons?\n\nEverything is meaningless.\n\nRoleplaying is 2000 and out\nWho wants to be an evil character anyway? Be the good guy concerned father and General of the Minutemen, don't try to kill the invincible Essential NPC's inhabited everywhere and most certainly, don't try to make any choices that could change the world surrounding you. Also you have to see the reduced dialogue options mentioned above in correlation to the possible solutions/outcomes of a quest. For that, just check out the very first quest in New Vegas and how you could solve it with the following actions:\n\n- Quest starts with Joe Cobb (a bandit) intimidating a townsfolk for handing them over a person which they hide and that the bandits will attack the place\n\n- Help the townsfolk:\n- - Optional: Kill Joe Cobb the very first moment you see him arguing, so the Bandits will have one member less when attacking\n- - Optional: Recruit several people living in the town to help you out with their presence and supplies when the bandits attack\n- - - For convinving them you'll need various skills like Barter, Medicine or Speech i.e.\n- - Prepare for the attack and then defend the city\n- - Every of your allies who dies will stay dead\n- - Don't let the bandits win, or the quest will fail\n- Finally you've done it and became friends with the townsfolk and claim your reward, unfortunetly the powder ganger bandits will now shoot you on sight\n\nHelp the bandits (powder gangers):\n- First, kill the person hiding in the town for the bandits\n- Then you need to get some supplies for the bandits from the townsfolk\n- - Optional: Convince the shopkeeper to supply the bandits with leather armor using the Barter skill\n- - Optional: Obtain medical supplies from the doctor:\n- - - Lie to him, buy the supplies, steal them or simply kill the doctor and take everything you want\n- Proceed to occupy the town with the powder gangers and kill all residents\n- Don't let Joe die, since he's the one who promised you a reward\n- Finally the town will be taken over by the bandits and you claim your reward. The townsfolk stays dead and you're free to join the powder gangers by traveling to their main base\n\nOr you could kill the townsfolk on your own in between or go the psychotic way and just kill both. Also at this point you could still betray either the town or powder gangers. Regarding the bandits for example you could just spy their main base and hand the information over to the NCR military, then you could join to exterminate these criminals.\n\nThere are even more complex solutions like defending the town but still joining the Powder gangers etc.\n\nTL;DR = Compare the possible decisions and consequences of the first quest of New Vegas to the first Quest of F4. There's not a single decision to be made in the latter.\n\nDumbed down and streamlined for the target audience masses\nKarma system gone\nFaction reputation gone\nTraits & Skills gone (RP)\nSpecial/Perk trade gone. If you wanted to improve your Special stats, you had to pass on a Perk or find a rare Bobblehead. Now you can just max out everything eventually (It's really just a level & loot shooter as of now)\nFreedom of choice gone (dialogue wheel, invincible Essential NPC's, concerned family father predefined character, no choice to be evil, simplified quest decisions)\nWeapon condition & Hardcore mode gone without any alternative\nConsequences gone (Not even the choices that are still there do really matter. You've literally no influence to the environment anymore other than siding with a faction, which doesn't have many consequences either)\nIn addition to above, companions really are just a invincible meat shield by now\nInteresting locations and characters gone, everything is purpose-built for a little FPS action or for some linear main quest and the world is filled with generic characters (although there are exceptions)__________\n\nLet me clarify a few things last: This is NOT a hater review. I love the Fallout franchise with at least having 300 hours into F3 and FNV. Also I'm not trying to trashtalk this game per se, since I really love the new Power Armor, shooter mechanics, modifications system, Workshop and I'm actually enjoying the game for what it is. Also I don't mind the graphics, stability or bugs, it's questionable but fine imo. And the main story isn't any worse than previous games.\n\nBut what I most certainly do dislike is how they are draining the essence of the original games out of this installment. Also advertising it as a RPG and Fallout succesor while it is really just an Exploration shooter with some sanbox elements is not okay in my eyes. It's the exact opposite of what every fallout fan was expecting, namely a very weak RPG and survival theme. And the worst thing about this: It works out for them. With the new casual target audience they'll probably make a lot of money with F4 while dissapointing most old and hardcore fans.\n\nAnd that's just bull-sh-it. Also it could eventually backfire at them, since I've seen quite a few games and franchises failing hard because of too hard monetization attempts, just like casualizing or recycling too much.\n\nRating = Mixed\n\nFurther clarification\nWhy I liked the package of Special/Skill points and traits/perks more than the simplified F4 system: I liked the old system way more because it just felt more natural and realistic that way. Choosing you characters Special foundation, then building onto that with Traits and skill points as well as having different perks avaible every level because of the given build made my character feel dedicated. He wasn't an almighty allrounder being able to do everything he wants but there was a much clearer character progression in my eyes.","November 22, 2015","false","121.8"," 1,944 of 2,861 people (68%) found this review helpful 111 people found this review funny","68","944","2","111","187"

I feel like they took a step in the opposite direction from what everyone was expecting. The game is more FPS-based than ever, with shooting your way out as the only option surprisingly often. Hacking, lockpicking, etc. is a joke, if you want to progress, all you need is a gun. In fact, you HAVE to progress with your gun, because gone are the days of talking your way through New Vegas.\n\n4/10, I hate to say it, but feels a lot like "We needed money" was the reason this game was made.","January 28","false","82.7"," 615 of 889 people (69%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","69","615","889","32","10"

Yes the dialogue only has 4 options, but 90% of all dialogue in the other Fallout games had 3 to 4 options. The dialogue is my biggest complaint, but It's not that big a of a deal in retrospect. My other complaint is that quests often have 1 ending, I would love to choose from several endings but I do not expect this for every quest.\n\nThe Game is beautiful, it's got a great feel to it and I love the way the world is set up. The dirt may be a boring brown but you find that the Post/Pre-War buildings have a nice color scheme and It makes the game that much more nice looking. As for people who are underwhelmed by the map, C'mon? If you want to be underwhelmed look at New Vegas. The City was an empty pile with 50% of the buildings being unenterable. It had a total of 6 nice looking buildings, That was it!\n\nThe Power Armor makes you feel like an absolute BEAST! I don't mind that they gave me a Minigun and Power Armor in the first 20 mins of the game because the Armor is in bad shape to start with (and after killing a Death Claw it's in worse shape) and after killing everything in that mission I only had 21 shots left on the gun. I droped it because who wants to carry around a useless (and heavy) weapon. The people who are questioning the use of Power Armor in the first 20 mins should take into consideration that it's a way of giving you an incentive to find, craft, and customize your own set(s). In Fallout New Vegas I never bothered with Power Armor because I already had some cool cowboy stuff, and it didn't do that much for me anyways. Not to mention that it looked pretty bad too.\n\nI don't mind the Perk system because they were always the best part about leveling up anyways. I like looking at all the options that are placed before me and planning out my character before I even hit level 5. For this reason alone, I do not agree with the people claiming that "Fallout 4 is not an RPG" off of the grounds that dialogue choice is limited. You get to make your character look the way you want, fight the way you want, join the factions you want, and so on. You get to create a character who is individual to you, just because he/she can't say exactly what you want to say doesn't mean that the game is not an RPG.\n\nNow that I'm done defending the game from common criticism lets talk about what the game did exceptionally well at. The game has amazing sound design, I'll be walking along and all of a sudden I'll hear far off shots. The fact that I can tell what guns are being used, how many people are shooting at eachother and how far off they are from me speaks valumes for the game's sounds. This skill comes in handy more times then you might think.\n\nAnother thing That I like is the looting system. The game feels so much more seemless now that I don't have to look through body after body to find nothing useful. Instead I am given a nice UI that tells me exactly whats is available to loot. I can also choose to go into a more indepth UI if I want to.\n\nCharacter/Enemy design looks and feels great. Ghouls look and act far more "feral". Mole rats have a nice little add on with the ability to go underground and pop out at you. Your Dog now has the ability to pin people down so you can shoot them (Team work is actually a thing now!) and I am overall impressed with how far they came from the "Run at the enemy and block your friend" companions from Fallout and the Elderscrolls games alike.\n\nFinnally, You can have lasting change in a Fallout game. The fact that you can build your own settlment, is the largest change in a Fallout game since the destruction of Megaton. It adds just as much content as being able to say something new, and I like the change. The next related topic is the crafting system, which is extensive. Build what you want were you want. it's a great feeling and I love it.\n\nCons:\n- "I wanna say something else!"\n- "Put the gun, on your back!" (Gun randomly appears when you have to use it)\n- Lack of Quest endings choices\n- Repetative Quests (Like some Skyrim Quests)\n\nPros:\n- Looks Great\n- Sounds Great\n- (Seemless) Feels great!\n- SOOO much crafting\n- Lasting impression on the world!\n\nThis Game IS an RPG, and it stands strong on it's own. I like it! :)","November 13, 2015","true","144.7"," 2,188 of 3,239 people (68%) found this review helpful 100 people found this review funny","68","188","3","100","103"

For everything it advances, it has taken a step back in the areas players would enjoy. On one hand, I am overwhelmed by the improved gunplay, the settlements, and the improvements to familiar monsters. But this game fails to deliver on player expectations for the series. We didn't buy fallout for gunplay and monsters, or to play minecraft. We bought fallout to experience a world, to lose ourselves in the story, and feel immersed in the wasteland - and fallout has not just taken steps back, they've fully disengaged from this immersion.\n\nThe immersion breaking is the hardest part for this game. NPCs you encounter can be summarized by the dialog wheel: [Tell me your Backstory in 3 sentences] [Give me a quest] [Give me extra money for this quest] [I'll do this quest later.] The deepest an NPC might get into telling you their backstory is two or three choices to get told a little more vague details about them. Even iconic factions with rich lore, like the Brotherhood of Steel, give you barely any backstory or information. Ask them about what values the Brotherhood holds? "Most of that should be evident by the fight we were just in. Also, we value honor and truth. And stuff."\n\nAs a final nail in the coffin, the game handcuffs you to the Father/Mother story. If you enter this game expecting to have freedom to ignore the story, then, don't go near any important NPC anywhere. The more interesting an NPC seems on the surface, the more likely they are going to force you into the worst kind of dialog imaginable: The No Choice But Yes. Without spoiling anything, my first encounter in Diamond City was a cool young lady, reminescent of Moira from Fallout 3. Eccentric and fun, I was hoping for some Moira-style quests, but, her first dialog is an interview where she tells you that you are a vault dweller instantly without asking and puts you into a question about your character's son that gives you four choices: [Stop Asking me] [Vague Answer] [Why are you asking me] [Son] - Except, each time you choose, she says, No! Choose [Son]. NO! CHOOSE [SON]. NO!!!! DO YOUR STORY! NOW!\n\nNo one will read this review and decide to not buy this game. This is a fact of life. However, I can only hope that by adding my negative review, it continues to make the review scores more suspicious. Bethesda failed me with this game, by stepping away from the deep roleplaying aspects and giving me a shallow sandbox to play in.\n\n(It looks like a lot of people are talking about this review in the comments.

I shook a lot of it off as being excessive and that his concerns would be purely his, not really seeing the point he was getting at. I was stoked as hell to get at the game and the moment it was released, I launched full speed into its content.\n\nWell, having completed the vast majority of quests in gunfire, the only vaguely useful aspect of my character being charisma (which does sweet FA in most cases) and the main story feeling surprisingly uninvolving despite the story and factions being built around the protagonist: I can safely say that I finally understand what he was getting at.\n\nThe roleplaying aspect that was present in Bethesda's previous two games and the original games ultimately made the Fallout franchise what it is: your story. Fallout 4 is not your story. The player is irrevocably shackled to the introductory sequence and main storyline in a way that alienates the player from having a unique experience: many quests being practically identical and only able to be completed with violence, the absence of Karma truly making this an uninvolving experience. It feels like a constant excuse to tote the new gunplay mechanics, which whilst being good ultimately don't feel rewarding half the time because aside from self-defense, the only time you end up killing people is in these same pointless quests.\nIt just pisses me off when I go into a factory and some characters have high level weapons and individual names - unique characters I would expect I can interact with like in the previous game, but we can't stop and talk or understand - nope, automatically hostile and trying to kill me. I have to kill them. It's boring as all hell after the first time and only worsens around the twelfth.\n\nThe amount of settlements and vaults is way under what I expected, many of them feeling spectacularly hollow. There are inconsistencies with items: stuff in pre-war safes that shouldn't be in there. There's practically no random events any more. The world feels empty and soulless, rushed and carelessly put together without any consideration for what makes a Fallout game great.\n\nIt's a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ shame that Bethesda have clearly dropped the ball so hard on this. I was expecting another Fallout 3, something that was really going to be my own and unique. But I'm going back to New Vegas instead, because there's not a single iota of what made these games involving and yours to experience how you wanted. It's practically an FPS disguised as an RPG and a pretty major disappointment.","January 25","false","30.0"," 406 of 583 people (70%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","70","406","583","14","5"

Don't get this game expecting an RPG as good as New Vegas. Get this game if you want something with a Fallout setting, but more of a Borderlands or Far Cry feel. Theres a world to explore and the gun play is solid, but gone are the RPG mechanics. The story is nonsense, most things are wasted potential or not fleshed out enough. Your SPECIAL build is not imporant and most of the perks are pointless since there are some obvious "mandatory" ones.  Gone are actual dialog choices replaced with an absolutely insulting 4 choice wheel akin to Mass Effect. Get a mod ASAP to flesh out the full dialgoue, but it's still not good enough. This game is a disappointing addition to the series, but go in having very low expectations and theres still fun to be had running around the world and collecting loot and just rolling with the ridiculously bad story. Play New Vegas if you want a solid RPG, play Fallout 4 if you want a solid shooter.\n\nPros\n-Much improved graphics, animations, and gun play over previous modern titles.\n-Some great music, although some of it recycled from older games on the radio stations\n-Fairly big world to explore\n-More intuitive system to sort throught chests\n-A solid FPS game\n\nCons\n-Not an RPG, stats don't matter\n-Very few enemy types. Very few animals. Get used to raiders and super mutants.\n-Very very few towns/cities. Unacceptably low.\n-Lack of random events and a generally low number of actual quests.\n-All the locations on the map exist just to be kill or fetch radiant quests\n-Dumbed down dialog, choices are meaningless and lead to same outcome. Speech checks are gone, fun things like Black Widow don't have any unique options. No stat checks.\n-Pacing is awful. Within one hour of the game you have power armor (with no training), a minigun, and become the general of an army\n-The whole world revolves around you. You become the most imporant person in every faction.\n-All the factions are poorly written, none of them are fleshed out, and I still don't understand the Institutes motivations even after seeing all the endings\n-Terrible story. The main plot is "resolved" about 50% through the game, but for some reason the game continues?\n-Handful of forced references to reference Fallout 3, but continously ignore New Vegas\n-Wasted potential. Locations such as the Combat Zone doesn't have a quest line, the USS Constitution kind of just ends abrubtly, too many radiant quests for factions. Not all the compnaions have a quest.\n-Settlement building is bare minimum. Very few build options, difficult to construct multi floor buildings. Defense don't matter. Enemies will teleport to the middle of your town bypass defenes, kidnap people, and there's nothing you can do about it. Settlement happiness has no logic to it. Good luck getting the 100 happiness achievement.\n-Armor pieces. You cannot wear any of the armor outfits in the game as it disallows wearing pieces along with it. Even if you wanted to the stats are much lower than the armor pieces. Solved with a mod, but incredibly poor design. There are only about 4-5 choices for armor piece which is very low.\n-Legendary weapons make weapons less unique and more RNG. Finding a named weapon is just a legendary weapon you could have received as a random drop. Not many new weapon types compared to old games either (one maybe two?)\n-Not really any intresting choices in the perk tree. Three-five mandatory points into each gun style of your choice, lockpicking, hacking, crafting, and science. This late in the series I would have expected something new.\n-200 years since the bombs fell and the world is littered with skeletons for some reason. They are even in towns and settlements and unremoveable\n\nEDIT: I wrote this in the comments, but people don't seem to know how to read so I'll put it here:\n\nNot sure what people's logic are with saying "Hey look he played it alot!" I paid 40 something for the game of course I'm going to play it. I also got all the achievements for it, while not difficult shows I actually explored everything the game has to offer. You're allowed to be dissappointed with something and still see good in it. I don't want to see future games be dumbed down like this and expressing concerns is the best way to do that. I'm not alone in this seeing as how 4's user reviews are drasticly lower than New Vegas.

It feels bigger than the Worlds of Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas and theres lots of small stories to discover, but they just arent fleshed out. You find holotapes, notes, letters and entries on terminals, but these stories are all already finished, either because it was before the War or should establish some backstory to a place or to lead you to a reward. But thats it. There are sidequests offered by numerous people throughout the wasteland, but they all are pretty much just about going somewhere and killing something, with the personalities of the people that give you these quests feeling rather lackluster and unrelatable, even if the reason for them giving you these quests in the first place may be understandable and relatable.\n\nIts hard to emtionally connect to the World and the People within because Fallout 4 in simple words lacks one really important aspect: Soul\n\nInteraction\nDiamond City, which is supposed the be the "Great Green Jewel of the Commonwealth", turns out to be essentially just a marketplace with the home of some compagnions nearby. The residents walk around, operate workbenches or sit somewhere with some food or a drink in front of them. But thats it. They dont react to you. They dont resent you if you choose the arguably "evil" faction(s) and take actions that would bring the Commonwealth under a dictatorship. But they also dont appreciate you for helping the people of the Commonwealth out. In fact, they dont recognize you at all. Theyre just there. Sadly this translates to all the NPC's you meet. Everyone who isnt involved with the Story or a Sidequest just kind of exists in his own confined space. This goes as far as the closest thing to an interaction between NPC's ,that arent followers (some followers will exchange lines with other followers, or butt into conversations with one or two sentences to show their opinion), being two raiders joking about their druguse when they loose you while sneaking or telling eachother a story if you listen long enough. But thats it. Noone recognizes you (except members of the faction you finished the main storyline with, but even they just give you generic lines), nor does the world go through a significant change through your actions, which makes it feel like the whole game lacks depth. The world is pretty to look at, but it doesnt feel alive.\n\nDecisionmaking\nWhat plays into that is the disappearance of the karma system. Fallout 4 doesnt offer any real moral choices. In a way, you dont even get to play the bad guy anymore. You can give sarcastic answers, sure, but thats about as evil as you can get. Theres no moral pathway to follow. You cant become the shining hero of the wasteland that everyone likes, neither become the villain everyone fears. You cant get on the bad side of a faction just through your actions or on their good side by blending in through wearing their clothes (which was a great feature in New Vegas). Youre simply always the good guy, who can choose to do the chores that NPC's give you or not.\n\nQuests\nNote that I say chores here, then thats basically what the quests in Fallout 4 are. Chores. To aquire new places to build a settlement for example, you either have to stumble across an empty settlement or wait until you are given a quest to make an existing settlement your ally (which by the way always runs through 3 different variations of the quest  Those being: kill the guys that gave us trouble, save a kidnapped person or clear out a settlement space you havent discovered or cleared out yet ) The other quest almost all have that same principle as base. Go check something out and kill the entire population of that place seems to be the bottomline for most of these quests. Which becomes really repetitive. Especially considering how unimmersive the npc's are voiced, which gives it a bland, monotonous taste.\n\nLore\nOntop of that, at some points the game doesnt even make sense in its own lore.  For example at one point it exhibits that ghouls dont grow up if theyre ghoulified as children, only to later have a school in which the all the kids that have been turned to ghouls have grown up to be adults. This choice is made to prevent the player from killing children, yet it takes away from the immersion, by having inconsistencies in it owns lore.  Another example of that would be the female protagonist being able to wear power armor, despite not having any of the lorewise required training necesarry to do that.\n\nStory   Contains minor Spoilers\nOntop of that, the Story of the game also falls short. From the beginning on, in Fallout 4 youre playing just a normal person. You lived before the war, where the male protagonist is a veteran of the U.S. Army and the male protagonist, his wife a lwayer. Youre not a hardened wastelander. The game acknowledges this, by making your character questions the Radroaches the first time he sees them........ and proceeds to then completly forget about this fact. Sure, theres some dialog options, that let you state youre from a vault but thats basically it.\nThe main character leaves the vault in pursuit of their infant son (without much more griefance than taking the ring off their murdered spouse and swearing revenge) and goes onto a killing spree, without any hesitation whatsoever. Why? Because the game tells you to. This person, who knows nothing about the wasteland disposes of several human beings, whose motives are unclear to him and he knows nothing about, except that they look dangerous, to rescue: another group of human beings he knows nothing about. While doing this quest the main character also displays the ability to use power armor. Which makes perfect sense considering the male protagonist was a soldier before the war. In the case of the female protagonist, this isnt the case. Yet she shoots rifles, shotguns, pistols and every other weapon in the game as if she had done nothing else all life long and moves in powerarmor as secure as in normal clothes.\nOf course I understand the design choice behind this but from a lore standpoint, this simply doesnt make sense, as every title before it required special training to move in the power armor. Ontop of that the maincharacter simply looses interest in their son after actually finding him, reaction in some options completly cold toward the person that they spent the entirety of the story up to that point searching for, which makes absolutely no sense. The entire rest of the story from that point on revolves around who takes control of the commonwealth in the end, with the family story almost entirely being shoved aside.\n\nTl;dr:\nThe game lacks the soul that made the other Fallout games feel alive, and decides to put shootergameplay over lore and                                      story.","April 30","false","424.8"," 962 of 1,433 people (67%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","67","962","1","44","52"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kissmymedkit/recommended/377160/","kissmymedkit","FADE ZEBRA KISS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kissmymedkit/","106 products in account",""IT JUST WORKS"\n7 years of development - for this? Well ♥♥♥♥, what happened here Bethesda?\n\nPeople like me got hyped up and bought this game because it said Fallout 4 right in to your face.\nBut then, then the disappointment came and I really want to like this game, I really do, but I cant.\n\nWhat happened to the moral system? Why do I feel like the Sole Survivor is apparently just a sarcastic emotionless ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that isnt smart enough to handle basic math questions? Why is this story so random and weak? Why is the game forcing me to side with one of the factions from the game if I try to find my lost son in a wasted world full with death and destruction? Why Bethesda used such a god awful dialog system like with the mass effect games is beyond me\nI cant believe how lazy Bethesda went with the RPG element from the game. Why even bother with it if you dont want to ♥♥♥♥ around with it anyway?! Its hard to believe what I see here.\n\nWhat we have here is a solid shooter that tries to be an RPG but fails because of the lack of communication with the world. I dont feel like Im an helpless parent that just survived the nuclear fallout and went out to the world on revenge and the search of my lost son. I dont feel like Im in a wasted world trying to survive not only because there isnt even a ♥♥♥♥ing survival aspect in the game. After the story goes on I seem to care less and less about the actual goal from my journey just to get reminded again that I apparently wanted to do something hours ago. Nonsenical plottwists at the end of the game and faceless characters. The only characters I remember  are just the companions you can have throughout your journey, not only because their AI is broken and the pathfinding is laughable.\n\nEnemies in this game arent smart and not even a challenge, Legendary enemies are just bulletsponges. If you look for a challenge here, you wont find it, cracking up the difficulty will just make you deal less damage, recover less health, and let the enemy deal more damage. Its beyond me why there is no balance between each difficulties, its just gets harder for the wrong reasons.\n\nThe dialog system is a joke. You cant be mean, the game wont allow you that. You also cant say no because the no answer is still a yes answer, like what? And apparently even if my character is maxed out in intelligence his brain isnt working enough to figure out what science is. There is no use of any of your perks or attributes in the dialogs, but charisma. With the removal from the old level system we have a rushed perk tree system that makes me think why I even bothered with intelligence if the only worth SPECIAL attribute  you should max out at the beginning is charisma and luck just because you can talk your way out of this horrible dialog system.\n\nBuilding your own home or base is clearly rushed and buggy as hell. You can completely ignore it, or spend your time building up an illusion you wont care about anyway since its just busy work. Even though the game wants to tell me my settlements can be in great danger if I dont add some stational fire support, there isnt really much going on because apparently no one dares to attack any of my settlements.\n\nMost characters are just boring and I cant build any relation to any of the companions because they just feel like they dont have much purpose other than running into my bullets or dont even show up at all doing the bad AI programming. The only character I even liked is Dogmeat. Romancing in this game is just awkward, I felt better having a romance option with someone In skyrim just because I had a whole marriage to be part of. Characters dont interact enough with you, and other than keep getting on my nerves because they dont like it if I picklock a owned lock there isnt really much to say.\nThey may say something doing this awful dialog system,but thats it.\n\nThe Ending is the worst ending I've ever had to expierenced since mass effect 3's ending. I wasted my time trying to believe that the ending is not just the same ending with all factions but I got proven wrong for good. What happened to the ending not telling me what I did the past ♥♥♥♥ing 40 hours. ♥♥♥♥. I had more fun reading stories from f2p games rather than torture myself through this madness. Maybe Bethesda will give us better stories to expierence with the DLCs we can expect... or not.\n\nOverall this game is fun as a shooter but a poor excuse to call itself an RPG. The story is boring and the characters could look.. or be better. Let us pray that modders will fix what Bethesda has left us to deal with.","January 23","false","167.8"," 1,101 of 1,644 people (67%) found this review helpful 60 people found this review funny","67","101","1","60","55"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vulf/recommended/377160/","Vulf","Vulf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vulf/","298 products in account","So I sank nearly 200 hours into this and I feel like I finished everything that was worth doing around the 80-100 hour mark. F4 certainly has not changed my opinion of Bethesda games; They're like junk food. They taste good and sometimes you get a craving for them, but they ultimately leave you feeling empty and unsatisfied.\n\nI don't particularly want to rant about every detail I didn't like in this game, but there are some things I feel I need to talk about. The game has no challenge worth mentioning, unless you consider chipping away at bullet-sponges to be a rewarding experience. Similar to the Super Mutants of Fallout 3, Deathclaws have been downgraded from how they used to be and are now the new "Generic roaming tough-guy enemy" (Even though they shouldn't be roaming in the first place). Just like Skyrim, NPC's dump meaningless and unwanted quests in your journal if you even so much as hear them whispering in the distance. You're expected to do everything for everybody and it gets tiresome quickly. Example: One of the most common side quests is to clear out a spot that would make a good new settlement. Generally the person giving you the quest will say something like "I've got some friends who want to move in there". So you clear out the place, report back, and 2 settlers will move in to their new home. However, they do nothing when they arrive. They won't set up a farm, beds, defences or even attempt to clean the place up. Despite being told that these settlers wanted to move in once this piece of land was cleared out, they are perfectly happy to just sit there and starve to death until you come back and build up the place for them. What exactly was their plan for the place they asked you to clear out for them? I really can't stand how incompetent everybody is in Bethesda games. Also these kinds of quests are pretty much unlimited, so even if you do take the time to build up settlements for people, there is no sense of progression because you're immediately bogged down with 3 or 4 more of the same quest (Literally, as many of the quest-givers have a nasty habit of giving you 3 or 4 more quests before they allow you to turn in the ones you've already finished). At the time of writing this review, the GECK is not available so mod support is limited and as of December 7th 2015, an update was added which removed what little mod support the game already had (So long, Pre-war house). On that note, I don't understand why rebuilding pre-war stuff is not an option. When it was revealed that you were a pre-war survivor and military veteran, I figured that you having pre-war knowledge would become a big deal in the game. In FNV I remember someone saying that mining machines are tricky to use because nobody alive has the knowledge to repair them, or rebuild them if they ever completely break down. Not to mention HELIOS 1. But no, your characters status as a pre-war survivor is meaningless. He/she rarely even mentions it, he/she can't even sweep the piles of leaves and rubble out of his/her home. But hey, that's my fault for expecting more depth from a Bethesda game, I don't know why I keep trying.\n\nPlease excuse the wall of text, but I assure you, that was the short-list.\n\nIf you already got Fallout 4 on release, chances are you've finished it and moved on, so I'm really just writing this review for anybody who's still undecided about getting F4. This is certainly not Fallout New Vegas. It doesn't even have a Hardcore mode (Despite carrying over Skyrim's cooking system). I've been told that F4 started out as a mod for Skyrim and it sure feels like it. You really won't miss much by waiting for this game to go on sale, maybe in the form of the GOTY edition, when full modding support is available.","December 8, 2015","false","355.5"," 590 of 873 people (68%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","68","590","873","26","29"

I like it more than fallout 3 but I think New Vegas is still the best "modern" fallout game. Anyway, here are my pros and cons after over 40 hours\n\nPros:\n-Exploration is even better than Fallout 3, tons of stuff to find in a dense environment\n-Gunplay is vastly improved, VATS is no longer essential but its still fun to use. Guns have proper recoil and several different stats including fire rate, range and damage\n-Story is more of a "its okay" but its solid enough for me to put it in pros, but keep it mind its iffy on if you'll like it or not.\n-Followers have some backstory and relevance, they aren't just a means to throw your junk so you can keep carying more junk. Although they still function as that. Being able to lose a follower because you do things they don't like, is also pretty cool.\n-The game runs well FOR ME. I understand other people are having issues, but it runs just fine so far for me. I've had one crash, and only a few minor bugs. I do understand that there are serious issues, don't try to call me a fanboy just because I personally didn't have issues, I recognize they exist\n-Atmosphere and asthetic are much better than fallout 3. Theres actually color and it looks pretty good! Its not 10/10 in the looks department but its not horrible.\n-The dialogue itself is better than fallout 3. The dialogue selection and protagonist voice? I'll get to that in the cons.\n\nCons:\n-UI Is horrible. A mod is needed for this ASAP, its a pain in the ♥♥♥ to sort through\n-Voiced protagonist is a step backwards and makes roleplaying harder. I'm sure mods will fix this but that does not excuse how poorly executed the voice protagonist was. It doesn't ruin the game for me but if your into fallout for Roleplaying and story, it could ruin it for you.\n-Bugs. The bugs I've encountered have just been humorous and not game breaking, but game breaking bugs do exist and people have had them. If even minor bugs bother you, I'd wait for a few patches.\n-PC port missing options. However there is a mod for this on the nexus that lets you fix a lot of issues.\n\nOverall, I really love fallout 4 and think its much better than 3. However, New Vegas is still the best fallout game to me, Fallout 4's story and characters don't come close to being as good as New Vegas. Still, a great game and I highly recommend it.\n\nBuy At Full Price","November 15, 2015","true","90.3"," 1,086 of 1,645 people (66%) found this review helpful 63 people found this review funny","66","086","1","63","22"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BigSmokePhil/recommended/377160/","BigSmokePhil","Uncle Phil","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BigSmokePhil/","112 products in account","Ok, since i've spent a few days total playing I think I can write a review. I have very mixed feelings since the hype died down and I started to realise this games flaws, but there are also many other things that improved.\n\nPros:\n- Combat is no longer dull and boring\n\n- Wasteland is a good as ever\n\n- Addicting for the first day of playtime or so\n\n- Once you get the hang of settlement building its pretty fun\n\n- Companion quests are fun, as well as getting them all to romace/best friend status.\n\n- Power armour actually feels like power armour, not just a bad metal suit. Power armor modding is also worth the time. The mechanic is balanced by having to scavenge for fusion cores to keep your power armour functioning like how its meant to.\n\n- Voiced Protagonist: At first the voiced protagonist was hated, the game came out and people thought it was good, now people see it and think; eh. BUT IMO it does express the emotional tones this game wants to portray. When the character is meant to be angry, hes angry, sad, sad and etc. You can hear the emotion in the voice he or her is trying to portray.\n\n- Weapon modding is fun, and it does make a difference. But after a while it can become tedious.\n\n- Locations and map: The map is big enough is full of unique and interesting locations. One of my favourites is The Glowing Sea, where the atomic bomb was dropepd\n\n- Graphics: Personally, I think the graphics are just great but keep in mind I'm running at ultra with 60fps. some people might differ from me.\n\nCons:\n\n- Dialouge: At first i didn't think it was so bad, but now I see its a major flaw. You only get 4 choices, which are YES (good guy), NO (being a ♥♥♥♥), Sarcastic (Sometimes ♥♥♥♥ sometimes good) and question? Question is redundant because someone could tell you something about a topic or thing you already know a lot about, yet you still have the option to "  "?\n\n- Story: No matter what you do, you will end up with the same ending and story, regardless of your choices but slightly different (depending on the faction you side with will determine your slightly altered final mission battle ). No matter what you'll either be a good guy helping people, or a guy with an attitude. No matter what, the game will take you to the same place. The story also feels rushed and incredibly short. Withing your first 2 hours of story or so you're already thrown into power armor, when the other games took a long time to get you into it.  But atleast power armor makes a difference now. With 81 hours in i also cannot find any more side quests.\n\n- Replay Value: As mentioned above, the endings and story do not change depending on choices you make. Don't expect multiple endings or storylines like New Vegas had, thats not here. Since the story never changes (just like war), it feels like there is no replay value besides changing genders, the game still would be boring doing the exact same thing.\n\n- NOT ME PERSONALLY, but bugs: A lot of people have reported bugs in their game, I haven't expierienced any but always keep that in mind.\n\ntl/dr: Most mechanics are improved, making the game really fun. But the story options and ending are just lackluster, when its predicesor new vegas showed how a fallout story line should go (that was developed by obsidian though, not bathesda). Its still worth a buy and play though. Hopefully DLC might fix some story issues, but at least it'll add more things to do as well as other stories to complete and areas to explore.","November 22, 2015","true","244.8"," 834 of 1,260 people (66%) found this review helpful 52 people found this review funny","66","834","1","52","35"

I expected a game very similar to Fallout 3/NV, and whilst the games share obvious similarities, the fundamental gameplay is quite different. The game feels different to play, more modern. Movement feels like that of Witcher 3, jumping is more realistic, gun mechanics are vastly improved and the game explains itself far better than past Fallouts.\n\nSo far, I highly recommend this game but I'd suggest that if you do decide to play it, play it with an open mind. This is not the Fallout: NV the sequel, this is an entirely different game. There are a LOT of new gameplay features, (including a lot of survival and basebuilding elements,) that at first will feel extremely foreign, but you will quickly figure out and more than likely enjoy.\n\nI do think that if you have enjoyed past Fallout games, this is a must buy. Other than that if you're a general RPG fan, this game has seemingly endless replayability and I am personally finding it extremely immersive, moreso than any other game I've played perhaps ever.\n\nThe game is absolutely gorgeous, far more so than any prior Fallout- hell, Bethesda game in existence. I constantly find myself taking screenshots of breathtaking landscapes and wacky but appropriate interiors. It is also well optimised. I run a GTX780 and I get almost a constant 60 fps except in zones that have vast amounts of buildings.\n\nMy only gripe so far is that it is a little bit buggy, but of course that is part of the deal when you play games as huge as this. You can't reasonably expect Bethesda to find and fix every single bug. That said, these bugs have all been minor and I'm sure either a mod/patch will fix them in the near future.\n\nThe mouse sensitivity within the game is currently a little off right now but thankfully there is a guide on how to fix these using a .ini file which is extremely helpful.\n\nI don't usually give number ratings in my reviews but I'm going to give this a 9.5/10. Easily one of my favourite games of all time and now that I've played almost a full day of it I can say that assuredly.\n\nThanks for reading, fellow wanderers.\n\nEdit: Damn, I just noticed all the hate this game has started to get out of nowhere. I urge people to look into the game for themselves, it is genuinely a good game, it just might not be the Fallout New Vegas version 2 you were looking for.\n\nEdit2: 110 hours later I stand by everything I said in this review.

Wrong balancing\nOptimisation/FPS lock/Loading times\nDialogue wheel restricts options for anything but Yes, maybe later and sarcastic yes, good guy\nSpeech checks are now 90% for more caps only\nDialogue has barely any information about the world\nWorld devoid of lore\nBugs/glitches\nQuests are repetitive\n\nPros\nSmooth combat\nThe combat is heavily improved over the last titles and feels very responsive. Its by no means on dedicated shooter level but still vast improvements.\n\nGorgeous world\nThe layout of the map and individual places is very post-apocalyptic and visually pleasing. This goes only for how it looks though, because the world feels devoid of story. An issue though is that the textures look very washed out from close up.\n\nEnemy models and animations\nThe enemies had a massive overhaul and look alot better. Scorpions and ghouls and other mutated enemies look genuinely scary. Synths and sentry bots look like proper machines with an eye for detail.\nThe animations for all enemies also had a massive overhaul. Ghouls no longer just run at you, they behave like insane zombie-like humanoids. Bots are more rigid as they should be.\n\nDense world\nThe size of the map does not matter. Many disagree with this but I personally rather have a small map with LOTS to do than a endless field of nothing.\nIn Fallout 4 the map is smaller than most would like, but every few meters there is a thing to see. Be it a crashed train, a military checkpoint or a encampment. I love it this way although eventually after some time you don't care anymore about the individual places because there is just nothing to them. Just scenery, no heart, no story. Pretty but shallow.\n\nVoice acting\nThe people have alot more emotion in Fallout 4 than other titles and Bethesda allows you to change the view from 1st person to 3rd person to change to the person talking is amazing.\nDownside on this is that you see the textures better and the facial animations are still iffy.\n\nPerk system\nI really like how they did the perk system here. In older Fallouts you had to strategically think how you want your character and skills, making mistakes along the way and regretting those earlier choices. Now you can put points in your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. and individual ranks of other perks. While the balancing is strange and doesn't make sense ( relatively useless skills in late level perks ) it's still pretty nicely done and I like it this way.\n\nCustomisation\nAs in most Bethesda games they went all-out with the customisation, character, guns, settlements, ALOT of stuff.\nCharacter customisation is nicely done.\nGun modification is also pretty cool but in some things it was done poorly and rushed. Most guns have same attachments.\nSome special weapons like the Junk Jet have poor customisation.\nSettlement building feels tacked on. Don't get me wrong, I spent about 20 hours on Sanctuary Hills alone, but the fences and buildings are copy-pasted from around the map usually used by raiders. Clipping issues.\n\nCons\nWeapon balancing\nI have no idea how they went about with balancing this game because its all over the place. In the first 30 minutes of storyline you get powerarmor ( the weakest form ) and a minigun and I found my first combat knife 100+ hours into the game.\nCertain high level weapons like the classic Fat Man and Gauss Rifle are EASILY outclassed by average weapons like Combat Rifle, Laser Rifle and Assault Rifle because of rate of fire where ammo is also easier to find and massively cheaper.\n\nFPS Lock/optimisation\nOptimisation is done quite poorly because you have to mess around with the settings to just have it run a solid 60 FPS on high end PC's and even then it has that classic Bethesda stuttering when you turn around. Also missing certain options like a FOV slider making it a headache disaster for some people.\nFallout 4 is locked to 60 FPS ( which it barely gets in Down Town Boston unless you put certain settings down to bare minimum )\nThe loading times take FOREVER. You sit there from 20 seconds up to a full minute or 2 just loading in certain areas depending on your build and the area ( indoor/outdoor/number of clutter ).\n\nDialogue wheel/speech checks/dialogue no information about the world ( put all of them here because theyre very related )\nThis has been horribly received with the community because it eliminates the option to ask about history and lore and just general storyline the previous Fallout titles were filled with. Be it random trivia or history of certain groups, its not there anymore.\nYou get 4 options every time but I'm not even certain they could be called options. Its either,\n"I will do the thing" ( Down )\n"I will do the thing later perhaps" ( Right )\n"Tell me about the thing I will do regardless" ( up )\n"I want more caps for the thing" ( left )\nwith very little difference in these 'options'.\nIn Fallout New Vegas you could pursuade factions to either fight or befriend and negotiate peaceful solutions. Fallout 4 you speech check for caps. I've seen little speechchecks for information but its the usual regurgitated information about the shallow factions.\n\nWorld devoid of lore\nTo me personally this was the deal-breaker that made this review negative on Steam.\nWhile the world is beautiful and there is something to do every few steps and something to look at, it contains no information about anything. Its incredibly shallow.\nScraps of paper, books, terminals used to litter the Wasteland with stories about what happened there making every settlement/factory/building unique. They weren't always the best written stories but they were there.\nThey spend more time placing teddy bears in sexual positions than writing anything about this very interesting piece of Wasteland.\nSlight spoilers for an example. I was wandering around and I found a locked government bunker so I decided to enter. Inside I found a holotape with a man talking about the moment the bombs fell. It spiked my interest even more thinking I might find some lore here. Only thing inside was a terminal saying, This terminal was seized by the Brotherhood of Steel for your safety.\nAn entire government bunker, without any story, where scientists fled to escape the apocalypse, LOCKED FROM THE OUTSIDE, and the only terminal was wiped by the BoS.\nSo little places have actual story about what happened there and that being one of the main reasons alot of people play Fallout games, for the story, feels dissapointing to say the least.\nNo spoilers, the main story has big buildups and big let downs and many plotholes. Important battles have low count of NPC's and factions are shallow and only have 1 or 2 goals in mind.\n\nBugs/glitches\nAs always with open world Bethesda games its littered with bugs and glitches, places to get permanently stuck, textures all over the place and FPS problems.\n\nQuests\nRepetitive as hell, kill this, fetch that. No effort put into them\n\nTo me it feels like Bethesda wanted to make Fallout more approachable to the general public by including people to previously thought Fallout games had too much reading and ways to mess up but by removing a big chunk of this, they also removed a big chunk of what made Fallout, a Fallout game.\nYou can't please everyone and by trying to do so anyway, they angered quite a bit of people.","December 21, 2015","false","200.6"," 1,821 of 2,801 people (65%) found this review helpful 97 people found this review funny","65","821","2","97","138"

Despite this Bethesda holds off on releasing modding tools in order to sell their crappy dlcs and now tries to sabotage and usurp the modding community with the release of patch 1.5 and the site they are trying to replace nexus with.\n\n\n\nFallout 4:\n\nFallout 4 is a watered and dumbed down excuse for a proper fallout game, RPG elements are next to non-existent, your conversation options or Quest decisions DONT MATTER 90% of the time, there are three major factions but none of them are very likeable or interesting and dont really have any impact on the world outside or after the main quest. there are no real minor factions like in fallout new vegas, its pretty much just either they are friendly settlers/merchants/guards or they are raiders. With the exception of a few conversations, quests and characters the story is mostly boring and badly written. it all feels like it was written for 12 year olds, not 18+ (which is the game`s Age rating) its not nearly dystopian enough, characters are generally waaay too friendly and naive for the type of world they live in, many of which its extremely obvious would never even survive in a modern day wilderness, let alone a post-apocalyptic hellscape (take Preston`s gang of hobo-junkie-settlers as a prime example) i could go on for an entire review about this, but you get the idea...\n\nThe settlement building has no purpose, and its not half as good as it should be, you build a shanty town and a bunch of pointless characters live there doing essentially nothing.\nThe way it SHOULD be: you should be able to teach and train them with the skills/perks you have, make them specialists (craftsmen, traders, farmers, medics, soldiers or assassins for example), you should be able to send them out on missions, to take them with you as a small army, you should be able to establish a economy when your settlement grows large enough it should attract more and better traders, as well as increasingly powerful enemies and allies the larger and stronger it is, you should be able to earn useful, unique and fun rewards over time. happiness should be essential to keeping your settlement intact, realistically, the settlers should gradually grow into unrest rebellion and anarchy if you dont meet their needs, and you should have a reputation/karma if you keep being either a bad/corrupt/lazy or a good/benevolent/hardworking governor word should spread. if a settlement revolts or gets taken over by raiders you will need to reclaim it, either by diplomacy, stealth or force.\n\n\nThe removal of the karma system, you cant play as a evil or bad character or make tough decisions or pick the lesser evil, there are no quests or characters like mr.burke in FO3 tempting you with a deal with the devil, you are by default mr.goody two shoes no matter what you do.\n\nThe removal of the skills system, leveling is far less interesting or deep, explaining the why and how of this would probably take up an entire review.\n\nThe removal of repair, with the exception of power armor, you dont need to repair your gear anymore, which many people may like, it is a convenient change, but it also heavily reduces immersion, when weapons can suddely break, it adds upredictability to combat, the more upredictable and varied something is, the longer it will stay suprising and interesting.\n\nThere is far too little variation in interesting random loot, honestly, even though there are a lot of items most of them are either weapons/armor, consumables, or materials, there should be a lot more unique things to find, such as those magazines you can find, but for every type of thing, unique and rare guns, armor, ammo, food, medicines, materials, clutter/decor, readables and recipies, quest-starting items (journals or treasure maps for example)\n\nThe lack of random spawns (the monsters in the world always respawn as the same things, instead of a varation of anything plausible. Instead of supermutants in the same place every time, maybe mix it up with a possibility for dog packs, ghouls, or raiders, for example. this would GREATLY improve on the game. also, this is just a complaint but theres far too little variation in monsters, a lot of which feel very overused, ghouls, supers, synths and mirelurks felt like 75% of the things i met.\n\nThe dumbing down of combat/immersion: you dont regenerate health automatically, you have to CONSTANTLY pause the game and open the inventory and spam food/spam medicines to heal yourself, its immersion breaking and tedious AF.\nwierdly and stupidly enough, you regenerate broken limbs automatically, which is frankly, just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... and using 1 stimpak heals every broken bone in your body, unlike in fallout new vegas where you heal with doctors bags or using one stimpak per body part broken. radiaion does its thing ok, but far, far too boring, the more radiation you have the less max health you have.\nCrits are now these manual 100% hit chance shots you activate in vats... sigh...\n\nThe lack of any driveable vehicles, i know its hard to implement, nearly impossible since Fallout 4 uses Skyrims Engine, but still, add some sort of new thing please Bethesda, say--- driveable boats shouldnt be impossible? or skyships like the one from that quest? and what about mounts? it IS skyrims engine after all, and skyrim has mounted combat and everything, why the hell didnt you add horses? you could even add robot horses if they are somehow exctinct according to the lore...\n\nAlso Ron Perlman isnt narrating the game, which is blasphemy, he has an excellent voice and it has always been perfect for the introduction and endings, and it has been a tradition every true fallout fan has loved, instead now they use someone with a weaker voice who no-one asked for, next thing Bethesda is gonna do is change the fallout logo or something, you have to understand the importance of tradition with these things, people grow attached to what they initially loved from previous titles, and now you just disregard it in the same way bad movie adaptations usually do with the source material they claim to represent.\n--------------------------------------------------------------\nConclusion: Compared to what it SHOULD have been 4/10, and COULD have been 3/10, and what i WISHED 2/10\n\nHOWEVER Wait 2-3 years and its hopefully still going to be a proper fallout game, worthy of a 7/10 or a 8/10 when its gotten patched, dlced and modded.\n\nRight now though ... i Do NOT reccomend it. buy New Vegas instead.\nAs a long and final note: i fear, seeing as Bethesda have claimed all the rights to the Fallout franchise, the series can only stagnate, as is extremely apparent in the complete lack of anything new in Fallout 4, all that was "new" in Fallout 4 was the synths/institute concept, which was initially very interesting but later very disappointing, underwhelming and poorly executed.\n\n7 years since fallout 3 and THIS is the best Bethesda can do??!\n\nTake Fallout new vegas as a constrasting example: there were plenty of new things added, all the factions, monsters, lore. places and stories, that game was made by OBSIDIAN, NOT BETHESDA.\n\nMy advice to Bethesda: leave the modding community alone, and  let other companies make fallout games, competition is good, it gives incentive for everyone get better than those they compete with in order to sell their better products and services. all you ever learned was from the modders and the previous makers of fallout, let them light the path for you, because you are stumbling in the dark.","May 6","false","178.7"," 950 of 1,465 people (65%) found this review helpful 48 people found this review funny","65","950","1","48","36"

The player character sucks - Some RPGs give you a character and tell you to run with it (The Witcher, for example). But in those types of games, generally they allow you to choose which sort of Main Character you'd like to be, and their motivations are set up such that you feel like they're your motivations as well. In Fallout 4, the main character is a dad who gets really emotional about things, completely at random. You're told in the prologue, this is your family, everyone is happy, now someone killed that family, you should care. But what if I don't? What if I decide not to give a ♥♥♥♥? Well, too bad, the character gives a ♥♥♥♥ and the game will not progress without you playing in that manner. If it had been set up well, without the ♥♥♥♥ing white-picket-fence family, I might've cared. And the dialogue options are so hilariously restricted. You can't choose to kill Garvey, you can't tell the bad guys that maybe they're wrong about everything... you can't make any choices, except to either help people or not progress the game.\n\n2. The factions suck, except the Brotherhood, mostly - Without getting too far into it, the Minutemen generally have no idea what's going on in the Commonwealth, the other "good guys" seem to concentrate really hard on killing lots of people, and the "bad guys" are impossible to turn from their cause.  At least the Brotherhood are a bunch of racist ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who stomp around a lot; they got that bit right.\n\n3. The settlement building is entirely side fluff - As cool as the system is, it really has literally no impact on the game, whatsoever. It's just a time, money, and resource sink for the player. There's not really anything cool surrounding it; nothing interesting happens by way of your construction efforts.\n\n4. The Commonwealth has no soul - This is probably the biggest problem with the game. There doesn't seem to be any central "theme" to it, no style. New Vegas had a whole Western thing going for it, but here, you're just kind of in a city. It feels like there's bits and pieces of themes, with a bit of noir here, a bit of comic books there, a bit of American history everywhere, but none of it is fleshed out to the point of making anything particularly memorable. At most it's a couple quests in each line. On top of that, it feels like the bombs just dropped. For the MC, I can understand, but everyone else acts like they've been barely even getting by until you show up and save the day. It's been more than 200 years, you'd think people would have moved on after a couple generations. Especially with resources as plentiful as they apparently are.\n\n5. Everyone has power armor - What the ♥♥♥♥. What happened to it requiring special training to operate properly?\n\n6. The vaults suck - To avoid spoilers, I'll just say that only one vault has anything interesting in it, and it's NOT the story behind the vault. I thought they were all supposed to be interesting experiments, but they're all kind of boring. One of them is even, according to the logs, completely neutered as soon as it's sealed. So, why is it even a place that exists? Why put a vault into the game if it's not going to have some creepy experimentation going on? It could've been some cave that people live in, and it would've probably even worked better.\n\n7. You can romance the companions? - I thought your wife's murder was fresh in your mind, and your primary motivation. This game also taught me that if you're particularly charming, you can trick people into thinking they're in love with you. One companion in particular displayed zero attraction towards the MC until I started passing speech checks. Everyone secretly has the hots for you, I guess. Things went 0 to 100 real quick. On the other hand, this has incredibly little impact on the game, aside from unlocking access to a buff you get from sexing them.\n\n8. Nobody gives a ♥♥♥♥ who you are or who you're with - Nobody cares if you're openly working with the bad guys, nobody cares if you're a racist Brotherhood ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥... the only thing anyone seems to care about is if you're with the Minutemen, and all that gets you is more stupid "quests" to go kill raiders on the other side of Boston. The biggest offense was when I joined the brotherhood with a synth at my side. They can all see his wiring, why does nobody shoot him and tell me I'm off the force?\n\n9. Nobody cares about my 10 Intelligence. I'm literally as smart as possible, and yet somehow people need to explain to me how to fix a robot. People need to help me decipher high-tech plans despite the fact that half of them barely understand it themselves! If I remember correctly, someone even told me once that I wasn't smart enough to understand how a fission generator works. The MC still has to ask how to avoid getting horribly irradiated in the Glowing Sea, as if I haven't been stomping around in Power Armor for the whole game, with a closet full of hazmat suits back at home.\n\nAll in all, the game has little to no roleplaying. The majority of the writing is sub-par (with a few good standout quests), and the perks really only affect the combat. Bethesda has effectively made Fallout into an open-world shooter. If you understand that going in, and still want to play, then sweet, it's a lot of fun to shoot stuff. But it's really not what Fallout is about.\n\nALSO WHY THE ♥♥♥♥ CAN I NOT USE A POWER FIST WHILE IN POWER ARMOR AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA","December 20, 2015","false","89.7"," 1,082 of 1,679 people (64%) found this review helpful 104 people found this review funny","64","082","1","104","34"

Did Bethesda just forget there should be an actual reason for all the strange stuff going on?  Think of TV show Lost and you'll get an idea of the quality of the story.\n\nVery little content for what you expect from Bethesda.\nMorrowind - 400 hours\nOblivion - 400 hours\nSkyrim - 400 hours\nFO3 - 400 hours\nFO4 - 100 hours\n\nThe game has very little replayability.  Usually in these kinds of games, I use fast tavel and rush through everything and feel like I've missed 90% of content, then I reroll and start again and play more slowly.  In FO4, I rushed through with fast travel and saw everything, plus there isn't much incentive to play with different builds due to the mechanics of the perk system and the way levelling works.  However! The actual gameplay is pretty fun, like you would expect from this kind of game you start out weak, there is sneaking and stalking and playing cautiously with careful planning and strategy, that is until the snowball effect kicks in and you steamroll everything (especially if you use power armour, but that's a problem with these kinds of RPGs).\n\nThere aren't many guns in the game, although the guns that are available can be heavily modded for a number of purposes, which is great! The problem is, there are only a few guns which are really useful, the rest suck, plus most of them have ugly models.\n\nPlayer outposts suck.  They are grindy, mandatory, unrewarding and pointless.  If you're going to spend 75% of your man-hours developing this feature (I'm assuming this feature was supposed to make up the other 300 hours of lost content), at least spend 5 minutes to think of a reason for actually doing it.\n\nPeople argue with me and say you were too hyped and didn't meet expectations well I wasn't too hyped and I usually hate hype for games.  All I expected was FO3, no more, no less.  I didn't expect anything miraculous or immensely innovative, I just expected more of the same I've come to expect.  What I got was something kinda weird, however I did enjoy the hours of actual gameplay you expect from FO, it's just a shame they put too much emphasis on features I don't care about, such as trying to turn games into hollywood movies with all that expensive shiny crap they do, putting in really emotional and sentimental garbage story, and wasting all gameplay development time trying to turn the game into survival crafting crap.","February 3","false","112.1"," 210 of 312 people (67%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","67","210","312","11","42"

The weapon customisation is unbelievably in-depth, satisfying and fun, as is the armour customisation. The settlements are downright fabulous. Spent 20 hours building Sanctuary alone into a metropolis. The map is big and filled with cool stuff and very funny things (Super Mutants orders, for instance. Google it.). The Story is great, followers are helpful and if you're a person who hasn't played any other Fallout titles, this will be an amazing game.\n\nBut Fallout 4 is a step back in the Fallout franchise for a lot of reasons, therefore it may not be as enjoyable to a devoted Fallout hardcore gamer. The Perks system is watered down. You get power armour from the start, which is just wrong, wheres the sense of excitement from using it? Now its just: "Oh, Power Armour. Thats a thing". Not like: "OMFG I got power armour I'ma going to go and wreck some ♥♥♥♥!". The character also somewhat takes away from the RPG experience. In previous Fallouts, your character was not pre-defined. You could play as the bad guy, that was really fun. You could play as the good guy. But in Fallout 4 you can only really play as the "Concerned Parent." Which, while Bethesda really has done well, they've taken away something beloved to the franchise to put a new thing in. Take it as taking one step back and another step in a completely different direction.\n\nFallout 4 is a really good game. It deserves praise. But Fallout 3 and New Vegas deserve more.\n\nSo I'll give this game 2 scores:\n\nFor Gamers who have not played previous Fallout titles: 9.5/10\n\nFor Gamers who have played previous Fallout titles: 8/10\n\nEDIT: 8/10 is a mediocre score for a Fallout Game...","November 13, 2015","true","66.6"," 966 of 1,512 people (64%) found this review helpful 50 people found this review funny","64","966","1","50","20"

Don't even bother reading the rest, the gunplay is amazing.\n\nFor other poor souls, like myself, who enjoy a good story with multiple endings read on.\n\n\n\nThe first Fallout game I ever played was Fallout: New Vegas.\nIt. blew. my. mind.\n\nThere were endless possibilities in the vanilla game alone. Should I be a nerd who talks his way out of everything? A mercenary who works for the highest bidder? A psycopath who enjoyed killing people for his own pleasure?\n\nWhat I'm trying to say here is that, unlike New Vegas, Fallout 4 tells you from the start who YOU SHOULD BE. You are a concerned father/mother looking for their son, and after finishing the game once I have no motivation to replay it. The storyline is very predictable, and your choice of faction in the end game hardly affects the Commonwealth at all, you'll just be reminded by some NPC's of how great you are for leading them to victory. Yeah, sure np mate.\n\nCharacter creation is all about aesthetics now, since they removed the skill system in Fallout 4. There are only a few viable builds because every mission involves violence. Yep, there's no way of talking your way out of anything, you just get some bonus XP if you choose to go the charisma path.\n\nSadly, there's not much replayability in Fallout 4 at its current status. Maybe some mods later on will improve this, but I am reviewing the vanilla game. I downvote this with a heavy heart, despite all of the hype, Fallout 4 has not impressed me as a game that is worthy enough to be in this series.\n","December 6, 2015","false","60.1"," 297 of 453 people (66%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","66","297","453","13","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Riquinni/recommended/377160/","Riquinni","Gestalt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Riquinni/","64 products in account","WARNING: This is more of a rant than a review.\n\nBethesda is going on a downard spiral from RPG greatness to more casual gameplay, For the love of God they need to know just how important it is they stop watering down their games before they do any more damage.\n\nI started this game with high hopes and was instantly crushed when I discovered there was no karma or really any choice in the game outside of who your allies are which is total bull****. You can be a good guy, a sarcastic good guy, or an ***hole goodguy. At least in Skyrim you had the Dark Brotherhood to let you feel like a bad guy if you so chose (even then though the guilds in Skyrim pale in comparison to past titles).\n\nNot to compare the Fallout series to Elder Scrolls but it just goes to show how much their two franchises have been declining in quality over the years. As I played the game more I began recognizing many flaws in the engine itself as well which made it apparent that this engine was adapted from Skyrim's.\n\nI spent a lot of time modding Skyrim so there are many little things I won't take much time discussing that bug me such as when you unequip a weapon it disappears into some alternate reality never to be seen again until you re-equip it. Honestly how hard would it be to fix this? Even swords aren't sheathed in some way or floating at your side. Skyrim, Fallout 3, Oblivion, all managed to pull this off so there really isn't any excuse.\n\nThe game is fun but it didn't feel like I was immersed in a world that would be my playground to do with as I wish, but rather a linear game where I'd blast things to continue on my preditermined path. That isn't what I remember feeling when I first played fallout 3. Building settlements is a nice feature but it is limited and eventually I just focused on one settlement due to lack of interest.\n\nI haven't really played Fallout 4 since I beat it, if there were any impacting choices to be made I might have an incentive to make another playthrough. And I have not used any mods outside of postprocessing since I don't like the idea of corrupting my saves, a date for official tools would be nice.\n\nI am pretty old school so the graphics don't bother me, but it is kind of funny to think back when Bethesda games were always on the cutting edge of visual quality. It seems that the graphics suffer because it has been in development for so long, correct me if I am wrong. Too bad there isn't much to show for it from all that time.\n\nCD Projekt Red made substantially less money from Witcher 2 than Bethesda made from Skyrim and yet they developed a fantastic new engine that demonstrates quality and quantity. Also when people say "just wait for mods" to fix all your problems I think that says a lot about the developers.\n\nSo please Bethesda, listen to your fans and try to improve in the future. Otherwise you might lose your grip from your past innovations as a major player in the gaming industry.","December 16, 2015","false","97.9"," 1,136 of 1,791 people (63%) found this review helpful 61 people found this review funny","63","136","1","61","29"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PandaPal/recommended/377160/","PandaPal","Ari","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PandaPal/","339 products in account","As a huge fan of the Fallout series, I was extremely excited to get this game. I have them all, even Fallout Tactics. As much as I want to love this game, as much as I want it to be an awesome step forward for the series, the truth is: this game is a massive letdown.\n\nThe game immediately dips you headfirst into one of the basic flaws of the game: your character is already decided for you. Want to be the empitome of evil that clears out entire towns for caps? Nope, you're a concerned father. Want freedom in dialogue choices? Nope, you're just allowed to straddle shades of being a concerned father. There is literally no room for roleplaying with the choice of a voiced protagonist. Within the opening minutes, the heart of a Role Playing Game is taken from you and never given back. You cannot be a character of your own creation, you just get to change what your concerned daddy looks like. That's it.\n\nThe second glaring abortion of this game: skills are gone entirely. Just let that sink in a bit, we're talking what's supposed to be an rpg here and an established system from 5 previous games. Bethesda decided to trash it quite literally. No more intelligence beefing up your skill point gain each level, no more needing to tag skills or focus on what you want to be. Instead it's just completely gone, with tiny slices of it shoe horned into the perks system. You get a perk every level instead, and spend it on the new perks sheet. Perks even feel that much more watered down because of it. It's the only slice left of character specialization in the game, and it doesn't do nearly enough. It's cute looking, but also hides the ridiculous nature of leveling in this game.\n\nLeveling up makes character building pointless anyways. In all past Fallout games, your starting attributes were absolutely vital. It was who you were going to be. Melee oriented? Here comes the strength + endurance. Sneaky sniper? Grab that perception & agility. Then Fallout 4 comes in, and lets you learn that attributes are now nearly pointless from a build standpoint. You can add a stat literally each level, until you're perfect. Gaining stats in previous games was like a holy grail, extremely rare to find, expensive to do, but dear goodness you raised that 1 point in agility. Now you can just eat up extra attributes like popcorn, until you're a jack of all trades and builds.\n\nAnother glaring thing that bothered me 8 and a half hours in: I'd already explored half the map quite literally. And I play this game slow, with a terrible side of being a pack rat. I take my time and pick up everything. Heck, I spent an hour and 10 minutes in the tiny Vault 111, just making sure I didn't miss anything. And that's my biggest issue with this game so far: it's absolutely tiny. I later looked back at the map and realized most of the rest I haven't explored was the ocean. You will discover all the locations in the game absurdly quickly, and getting to them is fast. I personally liked the massive empty spaces of Fallout 3. If that's not your cup of tea, New Vegas did a more compact map extremely well. It felt more like an unpopulated wasteland, not to mention journeying there was half the fun. Now you can get anywhere with no planning, and do so in seconds. The worst part? This tiny space is pretty empty. Random encounters are very rare in the time I've played. There's not much of a sense of danger or worry, you'll get there in one piece and most likely never run into anything on the way.\n\nOne last tidbit, companions are all in god-mode. They cannot die, ever :/ They also join you with zero effort or next to no dialogue. The game washes your face with this too, 3 minutes into it you're probably already the new general of the Minutemen. You almost never took charge of a faction at all in the previous games, much less this easily.\n\nThe 3 things that have changed the most in terms of additions: are gunplay, settlement building, and weapon modification. Let's take a look at them.\n\nGunplay is most definitely the best improvement 4 has to offer. And when it really comes down to it, that's what this series has now become. It's barely an rpg anymore, it's much more of an action fps now. The controls are tight, the action in shootouts is intense, and vats is no longer a pause button. Bethesda made some right moves here, but even so missed a few basic things. The ai also isn't terribly suited to the new gunplay either, you'll either be up against someone firing out in the open, or have to chase enemies behind a slice of cover. Once in a while they will crouch behind sandbags, or lean from a corner. On the plus side, enemies on the whole are much tougher, especially the legendary ones. There are some great fights to be had, some can last minutes and require you to pull out the last bits of melon or stab a stimpak in while you run away. It's sad, there was some serious potential here.\n\nThe weapons look much more like what you'd expect in a post apocalyptic wasteland. The vast majority are put together from pieces of pipe, springs, anything you could grab. I like this compared to the mysterious numbers of pristine pre-war weapons in previous games. The modification system is pretty fun, and it's nice you can tailor guns to whatever you need from them. The same pipe rifle you use to snipe from a distance can totally be remade to churn out armor piercing rounds automatically. Unfortunately, there's 2 big downsides to this new system. First, you can usually find better modified weapons off of enemies than the ones you can make. Secondly, you will have the most powerful weapons early in the game. There's no sense of scaling here, everything you can ever operate is there from the get-go.\n\nFinally, let's talk about settlement building. You can finally manage and run settlements in the wasteland, not to mention build them to the smallest minutia. I've spent hours into this alone, just building up the right amount of crops, beds, etc. It adds some serious meat to an otherwise bare game, and in my mind is the 2nd best change this game did. But even so, it was rather poorly explained to the player. Trying to figure out supply lines, looking around on foot for your workers so you can re-assign them jobs... there's just far too much frustration and wasted time figuring this out. Not to mention the entire mechanic would have benefitted immensely from a freaking menu. How is everything else in the game viewable from your pip-boy, and yet you can't look up what your workers are doing & where? It's really rough around the edges the way it's implemented, I'm hoping modders fix this up, because it has extreme potential for fun.\n\nSo when it comes down to it, Fallout 4 is not the masterpiece the hype would have us believe. It's pretty stripped down, well past the point of being an rpg. The game can still be good fun, but I can't honestly recommend it at full price as it is right now. Down the road when it's on sale, and modders have saved Bethesda's butt it could turn into the experience it should have been initially.","November 11, 2015","false","16.9"," 4,459 of 7,112 people (63%) found this review helpful 200 people found this review funny","63","459","7","200","349"

Fallout 4 is unlike the other games in alot of ways, gameplay, developement and story. Fallout 4 takes a different approach to the apocalypse. Instead of focusing on RPG elements like the previous fallout games, it focused on bringing in more of the FPS aspects. From sprinting to hitmarkers, they practically copy and pasted everything from the FPS genre into the fallout universe, and lets just say it just does not mix. Fallout 4 had a stale, repetative gameplay, go here, clear out raiders, go here, kill synths kill synths kill synths, thats all you do in this game. You also cant be evil in this game, literally, the worst you can be in this game is a sarcastic jerk who occasionally kills a grandma or two. The sidequests have no interesting story nor are they fun to do at all. I was also dissappointed with the developement of this game, they took 8 years to work on this game, and it lacked so much! Fallout 4  has a map to a similar size to fallout 3, maybe a bit bigger, but with sprinting added to the game, you can easily get across the map in about 15 minutes.\n--SPOILERS PASSED HERE--\nFallout 4 also severely lacks a good storyline. You wake up in a apocalyptic setting, knowing your wife (or in my case husband) has been killed and your son taken, you havent had any bond with these two characters as you know nothing more then the 3 minute intro, so to be honest the entire time going through the story I didnt give a crap about what happened to him. The first half of the game you kill raiders, and all they have are pipe pistols, then you go up to synths, which are pretty much bullet sponges to make the short amount of areas take longer to complete. The story is the most linear of any of the fallouts other then 1 and 2. You have 4 factions to choose from, but they all have the same exact missions, so its pretty much just one story, reskinned 4 times. We all called the ending from a mile away anyways. Story is the best part of the fallout franchise, and to see them butcher it like this really sucks..\n\nAll in all, fallout has been one of my favorite franchises, and holds a special place in my heart, but this was one of my least favorite. I had very high hopes for this game, but it constantly fell short of expectations. With linear, repetative combat, a cliche story and a 8 year wait period to come out. I couldnt help but expect more from my favorite developers.","February 2","false","57.0"," 120 of 173 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","120","173","0","8"

I really do. But with the horribly balanced combat system, meaningless dialogue choices, boring quests and a pretty badly written main quest (even by Bethesda standards) I just don't like it very much. Is it fun? Yes. Is it addicting? Yes. But if you're looking for an old-style Fallout game, it's not here.\n\n\n\nNow follows a rant by a long-time Fallout fan with mild spoilers (about game design, not story. You can spoil that by yourself.).\n\n\n-Why are deathclaws so pathetic in this game? They do less damage than in FO3/NV, they lost their armor-piercing claws, they're slower and when starting combat that do that stupid roaring houl thing that feral ghouls used to do to make sure they never catch you by surprise. In return, they now occasionally dodge to the side every now and then. Wow. So scary.\n\n-Skills? Who needs them? Hopefully not you because Bethesda decided FO4 would be better without them. I hear this was done to make your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. more important than in previous iterations. Well, they failed. Big time.\n--TLDR: CHA is king, followed by STR and INT. The rest is worthless.\n--Why CHA? No speech skill anymore, so success in speech checks is entirely determined by CHA. You want to build settlements? More CHA = more settlers, more settlers = more resources/money. CHA also influences store prices, so high CHA means you'll have more caps than you'll even need.\n--F04's puts heavy influence on loot, and more STR = more loot you can carry. The high level STR perks are also very powerful.\n--More INT = faster leveling = more perks. 6 in INT also gives access to gamebreakingly powerful weapon/armor mods.\n--Get PER up to 4 to pick locks. That is all it's good for.\n--AGI and LCK are only needs if you like VATS. I never once thought I needed VATS.\n--END gives health and health regen. But why bother with END if Power Armor makes you practically invincible?\n\n-I mentioned Power Armor. The lowest tier of Power Armor that you get for free in the first town in the game is protects more than twice as well as the highest-tier of non-Powered armor that takes about 50 hours of playtime to get. Yeah, I think there's some balance issues here.\n\n-Weapons. They really ♥♥♥♥ the bed with weapon balance. Lets get started.\n--There are so few weapons in this game. There's less than there was in FO3. There's two shotguns. There's two laser weapons. There's one plasma weapon. They included .50 cal ammo, but they neglected to add a weapon specifically uses it. You have to rechamber one of your pistols/rifles to use .50 cal ammo (and it's not even worth it since .50 cal damage is extremely underwhelming.)\n--There are two types of weapons in this game, worthless and incredibly powerful. The 'incredibly powerful' weapons are this either because they have a very good price per bullet to damage ratio, or they just do crazy amounts of damage. The Combat Rifle is an example of an extremely efficient weapon for its ammo, and the Deliverer/Gauss Rifle/Plasma weapon/Gatling Laser are examples of weapons that just do insane amounts of damage. Yes, I know these examples are late game weapons, but they just SO MUCH DAMAGE compared to what you're upgrading from. For example, you'll probably replace your Hunting Rifle (44 damage) with the Gauss Rifle (210 damage).\n\n-'Legendary weapons'. WHAT THE ACTUAL ♥♥♥♥ BETHESDA DID YOU THINK THIS THROUGH AT ALL?! Sigh. I hate these things so much.\n--Ok so basically 'Legendary weapons' are basically regular weapons with enchantments on them. They're dropped by randomly spawned 'Legendary enemies', which are exactly the same as regular enemies except they get one free full heal when about to die for some unexplained reason. They then drop one weapon or piece of armor with an 'enchantment' on them, such as 'Ghoul Slayer', or 'Irradiated', or 'Violent' or something like that which gives them some sort of combat bonus.\n--This would be great but 90% of these enchantments are worthless. Ooh you got a pistol that does a little more damage against ghouls or molerats? Or a neat little shotgun that sets people on fire for a little bit of damage? That seems good until you get a Legendary w/ Two Shot, Explosive, Crippling or  Wounding and show you that any other enchantment besides these are a joke. These enchantments on the right weapons completely removes any combat challenge whatsoever.\n--Yes, getting the right enchantments on the right weapons from a Legendary enemy drop is random. BUT DON'T WORRY! You can buy them too! With a half-hearted effort you can find merchants that sell Explosive SMGs, or Two Shot Combat Rifles less than an hour after leaving the Vault. And since you're a smart player with high CHA, buying them won't be a problem either.\n--So yeah. Bethesda added magic weapons which drop from enemies which magically heal. This system replaces FO3/NV's unique weapons that were scattered across the world. Remember when you would scavenge across the world and come across the Terrible Shotgun, or the thrill of diving into the Deathclaw Sanctuary for Vengance, or completing a quest to control an ancient orbital laser weapons platform that you could use on anything? Yeah you're not gonna see anything that in FO4 for the most part. You'll just find more 'Legendary' weapons with a punny name rather than something truly unique.(Full discloure: there are a few special things to find, but when I say few I mean it. Like two things.)","December 28, 2015","false","202.3"," 275 of 424 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","275","424","2","8"

He already has a complete story. Except in ME the story of Shepard was very interesting. Here the story looks more like "Go, be a good guy". Don't even make me start on the fact that when you play a woman character, your story basically tells you "You're a housewife. You've lived your whole life in house cleaning it up while your husband was a soldier. But you're still badass enough to handle that powerarmor 5 minutes after awakening in the wasteland".

Anyway, I think a lot of people are right for saying that this review is not a proper review, but more of a discussion piece. So in response, I'd like to issue a brief, genuine review for FO4. (btw reviews are not summaries, as some of you think you have to explain in detail an entire game for it to be a "review")\nIt's a pretty good game, I like it. I find myself getting lost in time when I step into the world of Fallout. I have already done quite a bit, and yet there is so much more I want to do. Collecting the power armor and giving them sweet paint jobs, finding the collectables and displaying them in my sweet post nuclear bachelor pad, and the excellent combat above all (which I think is the most improved aspect from previous fallouts). My only negative takeaway is maintaining the settlements. I got to the point where I don't really care about the people in my settlements or whether or not they are happy. The whole settlement happiness thing is stupid and it doesn't work in a lot of ways. But fortunately it is completely irrelevant.\n\nI'm noticing almost all of the negative reviews for this game include the phrase "this is a good game". I'm also noticing the vast majority of positive and negative reviews have 50+ hours, with most of those going 100+, and this game has been out for less than a month at the time of this review. It's just my opinion, but I think if you get 100 hours of entertainment out of a game, you got your moneys worth. This is a great game folks. The culture and atmosphere of Fallout alone is worth the price of admission. But you could have almost predicted that there would be a mixed response. On one side you have classic fallout fans, who want to prove that they liked fallout before it was cool by saying how much better the previous fallout games were. On another side you have the people who pay $60 for a brand new game and try to run it on their $250 hp with a 2ghz processor that they bought at wallmart, then lie and say they have a 12 core processor and 32 gigs of ram or something stupid (you know who you are). Then you have the folks who know how to enjoy themselves, and got everything they wanted out of this game. If you like to play video games, and you actually have fun doing it, you wont be sorry you bought this game.","December 5, 2015","true","216.7"," 903 of 1,439 people (63%) found this review helpful 98 people found this review funny","63","903","1","98","70"

Or Fallout New Vegas? Remember how it had things like:\n\n- Detailed Side quests\n- Skill Checks\n- Massive, Exploreble worlds\n- Choice\n- Detailed Dialogue\n\nWell, those wonderful features have been completely thrown out the window in favor of overly simplified console themed train wrecks.\n\nDialogue choices now come in one of four flavors: Yes, No, Tell me more, and Witty(ish) Sarcasm. While we're on the subject, I'm not sure who sat down and decided on making sure a character you had to interact with regularly (Preston) spoke his lines as flatly and roboticly as possible but thank you, thank you for also making this character immortal as well so that our torment might also be immortal. Moreover, why is it in a game that's decided to make scavenging a requirement, were all the followers given lines to complain about every item you pick up?\n\nMoving on, and while this isn't too much of a surprise to anyone who's played a Bethesda game, I really feel Bethesda outdid themselves this time on a main quest line that leaves you questioning what the hell just happened and why the game is over already. Your told to pick from one of four factions, who's motives are fairly simple:\n- I hate faction B\n- I hate faction A\n- I hate faction A and B\n- Wait there's three other factions here?\nAnd unfortunately, the amount of 'story' involved in each faction gets more lacking as you go down the list. All in all, it's thoroughly disappointing in that regard but let's face it, Bethesda's main quests aren't usually mind-blowing.\n\nSpeaking of quests, let's hit what Bethesda usually does well: Side Quests. In fallout 4, side quests come in two flavors:\n- Go to a place and kill everyone (In the flavor of either Raiders, Mirelurks, or if your really lucky, both)\n- Go to a place and kill everyone (second verse, same as the first), then grab a thing.\nBut let's face it, side-quests tend to break down into that sorta thing regularly, but what makes Bethesda's side-quests special is the amount of story put into each one. The NPCs, and locations involved all have a stunning amount of story put into them, and in Fallout 4 this isn't the case. Multiple NPCs simply tell you to go to a place, and kill a thing.\n\nBut hey, maybe the locations themselves have detailed stories behind them, like in Fallout 3, or the earlier Elder Scrolls games right? Wrong again, welcome to "There was stuff here, but now it's raiders" the game. Just about every location you go to doesn't even have story behind it, just a building and some Raiders, Mirelurks, or Robots. Occasionally you get a note between two people complaining, but all in all it's incredibly disappointing.\n\nAlthough, it IS an RPG, with all the lack of effort in those previous areas the skill-check moments must be impressive right? Oh wait, there aren't any. Okay, that's not entirely true, I mean I found ONE side quest that had effort put into it with decent writing, skill checks, and a story to the environment.\n\nOne of the big selling points of Fallout 4 was the settlement construction system. Prepare to be let down on another front ladies and gentlemen because that too is another train wreck. You'll spend hours trying to cram people into tiny rooms, dealing with ♥♥♥♥-poor collision on unremovable garbage in your settlements, and my personal favorite, grass sticking through all of your floors. On top of that, you also get to defend your settlements from attacks that end in mere seconds if you're there, but result in complete obliteration if you decide the settlement can handle it's own problems.\n\nBut, there's one bright note in this train wreck of a game, and I can only assume this is what they spent their entire budget on because the rest of this game is just terrible. The Power Armor, and Weapon/Armor modding system in the game. These two systems are polished to a miror-like shine while the rest of this turd we've stamped with "Prepare for the Future"\n\nAll in all, your paying 60 dollars for yet another half-♥♥♥♥♥ Triple A game that the publisher and developer of the game are fully aware is ♥♥♥♥, but know you'll pay for it. And they know damn well no mater how disappointed you are with Fallout 4, you'll eventually shell out more of your money for the DLC in the desperate hope they're good.","December 22, 2015","false","552.6"," 810 of 1,289 people (63%) found this review helpful 64 people found this review funny","63","810","1","64","57"

Fallout is a RPG: Fallout 4 is a sarcastic dungeon crawler with bouts of contemporary memes. This replicated opinion of negativity comes from a source of profound love, and is not deprived from anger or biased perceptions. This review serves as a small movment of change, within a circle of dissapointed fans who refuse to accept or validate a; although decent-- mistake. Fallout 4 is like good clothing on a hollow shell. It looks good, until you get to know it a little ~ From a fan of both Fallout and the work of black isle studios...and for the record, I kind of liked Fallout 3.]\n\nI have to admit, seeing this entry in the franchise become so mainstream -- as if the series is at it's peak and this game represents it's heightened elevation-- that makes me upset. Fallout 4 should not represent the franchise to the widespread consumer base. Despite this being a creation from dedicated hard workers, it's still misdirected and relatively insulting to what the original developers established. Quite frankly, it's ambitious marketing from both themselves and fan enthusiasm got it this far. -- Oh, and there are game files that prove this game is somewhat unfinished; well beyond cut weaponary. But rather, cut mechanics and depth expected from such a title. That being said, that leads me to my next general statement.\n\nI admire others who love the video game industry. To me, it represents a distinguished degree of attention and dedication. But with the industry's increase in a consumer base, it's adapted to a shift into the mainstream ecosystem. Video games by default, are incredibly immersive products of escapism -- there is nothing else like it. But with this new found attention, games are heading into the realm of the broad and shallow. I've noticed a increase in high profile games being unfinished yet being passed off as other wise. These games are ambitious, so much so, that they tend to deviate from the established formula of it's predecessors within it's associated franchise, to appeal to a mainstream audience. These games end up becoming empty, with little bits of the extraordinary.\n\nThose little bits of the great, allowed me to put 50 hours into this. It was a decent game, but not a memorable experience. I'm giving it a thumbs down to prove a point, not because it's horrible, but because it jumped the shark while lost in the sea of sightless ambition-- and it became a tantalizing product because of it. They knew what they released.","January 26","false","105.9"," 101 of 144 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","101","144","2","0"

It seemed to get buggier and buggier as I progressed in the quests, the characters felt like they lost all the personality they did have and just turned into quest objectives. The best times I had in the game were the first 30 hours. It was great, I enjoyed every moment of it, and I want to recommend it for that alone. However I can't, not in it's current state.\n\nIt feels like an unfinished game. The settlement building, and the faction that goes along with it feel completely tacked on, buggy and not well thought out. A certain quest that required was so buggy I couldn't finish it for 3 hours. It was for things that needed to be connected together, but the game just wouldn't work with it. That's really where the game fully fell apart for me. It just brought to my attention things I'd been ignoring because it's a bethesda game, of course it's going to be buggy I told myself. It was denial. New Vegas was buggy, Fallout 3 was buggy, but they were so much more polished than this to me. The bugs weren't frustrating in those games (at least not the ones I ran into), and their stories could carry them so much further than this one.\n\nThe story is one of the laziest I've ever seen in a bethesda game. The only strong points were the beginning with the evactuation, (but even that could have been done a lot better, it still felt really rushed), and the last hour or 2 of the game through the brotherhood of steel ending. I made terrible choices, I hated myself with them, and they had an actual impact on me.

I wanted to love this game. And for a long time playing it, I did. But I can't bring myself to finish it, or even plod around aimlessly delaying the inevitable.\n\nHere's the problem with what happens near the end:\n\nThere's 4 main factions who you can join and interact with and gain Companions from. You get a feel for what each faction has to offer, as well as their unfortunate downsides. And one of those unfortunate downsides is trying to make you completely kill off the other 3 factions!\n\nFallout 3 and New Vegas gave you the opportunity to talk your way out of situations, and sometimes find peaceful resolutions to the conflicts. Here? Nope, you gotta kill EVERYONE ELSE because reasons. This game is BEGGING for a round-table peace conference like in Skyrim (another Bethesda title, in case you're wondering why I bring up an otherwise unrelated game): Get the faction heads together, let them yell at eachother for a bit, and find a way to bring peace to the Commonwealth. Heck, The Minutemen, Railroad, and BoS wouldn't have to give anything up (except in the later's case the pathological need to blow everything up), just convince the Institute to stop making killer Synths and replacing people, and everything would be FINE.\n\nBut no. Each faction wants the other 3 completely off the board, no matter how many innocent men, women, and children would die in the process. And that's not an ending I want to work towards, so I stopped playing.\n\nAnd that's why I'm NOT reccomending this game. There are other little things, too (Like people continually getting kidnapped even though your town is surrounded by 100 sentry guns), but this is the big one for me.

But let's answer a few questions first:\n\nIs it the Game of the Century everyone hoped it to be? No.\nIs it flawless? No.\nIs it disappointing? Kinda.\nIs it good? Yes. A million times Yes.\n\nWell, let's take a look at its Pros and Cons:\n\nPros:\n+ World Design: Bethesda has always created amazing worlds and Fallout 4 is no exception. Everything about world design is just perfect and can make you forget about fast traveling and go everywhere by foot.\n+ Character Customization: Fallout 4 offers a very rich customization system. You can customize every little detail on the character's face and with lots of clothing options, you can truly create your own unique character.\n+ Power Armors: Some may disagree with me; But I freaking love the new power armor system. It's finally something different than a normal armor and makes you feel like a true beast. And as a catch, they are limited by fusion cores. (Yes I know. It isn't really lore-friendly.)\n+ Crafting: Another thing I really loved about Fallout 4. IMO Fallout 4 has the best crafting system in all of Bethesda's game. You can create and attach various mods on your weapons and some of them can turn your weapons into an entirely different one which is really great. You can also create upgrades for your clothes and armors, make chems and grenades, and even paint your power armor (and in near future, make your own robot). Which is really nice.\n+ Combat: Though melee combat is still a bit clunky, shooting people in the face is much smoother than before. Unlike Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas, combat is now tolerable and actually enjoyable without using VATS.\n+ Voice acted protagonist: This was a bit controversial. But I'm one of the people who actually liked this new addition. In previous Fallouts and Elder Scrolls, it always annoyed me that my character didn't show the slightest of emotion. Now I feel like my character has a personality and is actually alive.\n+ Companions: This is also my personal opinion and not everyone agrees with it. I found all of them except Preston Garvey (It's pretty obvious why.) much more likeable than New Vegas and 3's companions. Especially Nick Valentine, the charming Synth detective, who is undoubtedly the best character in the game and one of the best in the entire series.\n\nNeutral:\n= The Story: Let's face it. Fallout series isn't known for offering deep, Bioshock-level stories. Though personally I found Fallout 4's story more interesting than the previous titles, it still isn't anything special.\n= Dialog: The thing many hated in Fallout 4. Yes, it does not offer multiple options like New Vegas. For example you can no longer use your intelligence or strength in conversations and only Charisma checks remain. Also there are many instances which your character says the line in an entirely different tone than what the dialog wheel said. The "Sarcastic" option is the worst example. Sometimes it's just a joke, sometimes it makes your character a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. With that being said, it still didn't really bother me thanks to the voice acted protagonist (I repeat, this is just my opinion.). Otherwise it would've been in Cons.\n= Bugs: I got to give some credit to Bethesda; this has to be the most polished and bug-free game they have ever released. Though many people have faced a lot of bugs and glitches, I only encountered two or three small bugs in my entire playthrough.\n= Graphics and Performance: This is by no means the prettiest game in the world but it still looks really good despite some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ textures. Performance is ok most of the times but strangely the frame rate goes nuts in urban areas. And I have a GTX 970.\n= Settlements: I admit I was surprised by the settlement system. It offers lots of options to make your own settlement and honestly it's very enjoyable. But it suffers from a horrible, horrible and horrible User Interface. It's so confusing that personally after playing the game for 120 hours I still haven't got the hang of it. And I discovered many of the options in YouTube videos.\n\nCons:\n- Simplified RPG mechanics: Unfortunately many of the game's famous mechanics were removed in Fallout 4. No Karma (I was personally fine with it though), No reputations, No skills. I hope Bethesda does not continue this trend in their future games.\n- Lack of choices: My biggest problem with this game. In previous Fallouts, there were lots of choices that really affected the world around you in a big way. I mean you could see the consequences of every choices you made and they largely affected the ending. That was the main reason I fell in love with Fallout. Sadly that isn't the case with Fallout 4. There are much less of them in the game and most of them have little to no impact in the world around you. Even the main choice you make in the game suffers from this problem. I hope Bethesda fixes this in the DLC.\n\nOverall despite some of the game's kinda annoying problems, I really enjoyed Fallout 4 and it's my 2nd favorite game of 2015 (second to Life is Strange, that masterpiece.). But I really hope that Bethesda does not continue their trend of simplifying - or as some of you would say, dumbing down - their game because it will hurt their future games more than Fallout 4. And for ♥♥♥♥'s sake use a new engine.\n\nMy score: 8.8/10","February 26","true","169.8"," 69 of 94 people (73%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","73","69","94","4","11"

The gun play mechanics have been revamped tremendously, and VATS is now more reliable. I found myself lost in the world for what seemed to be hundreds of hours, merely wandering the dangerous terrains of the Massachusetts Wasteland. You'll find yourself in Fallout 4 primarily focusing on one thing; killing things. Not only has the combat been majorly improved compared to previous titles, but also the enemy AI has been improved upon also. While the AI isn't exactly flawless, I found myself having enemies flank me from different directions, and take cover behind any nearby objects.\n- Crafting in Fallout 4 is a blast, in my opinion, with the overhaul of the crafting system dramtically expanding it. You can modify and upgrade just about any weapon you may find in the Wasteland, ranging from melee weapons, to rocket launchers and machine guns. Armor and power armor are also customizable, having their own modifications for you to add and remove. You can truly personalize each weapon and armor piece you have, adding and removing the many mods that have been expanded upon in Fallout 4.\n- The graphics are also a major boost compared to previous titles. Even on low settings does Fallout 4 still look retain beauty in its post apocalyptic environment.\n\nNow I shall refer to the things that steer me away from Fallout 4:\n\n- Much like every Bethesda title, the game is littered with all sorts of bugs and glitches. Aside from this, you will find yourself with a watered down dialogue system, with with little to no RPG elements. Indeed, Fallout 4 has been practically stripped of many elements a true RPG game requires. For instance, every piece of dialouge you may pick from in this game will lead to the same result. Instead of talking your way out of many situations like in past Fallout games, and taking advantage of your social skills, you are left with the four basic dialoge options to pick from; Yes, No (yes), Sarcastic (yes), and yes. No matter what you want your character to say, the same end result will still be there. You cannot truly be your own character, as a result. In the past Fallou games, this was not the case. In New Vegas, you had many options to choose from in terms of creating your own character. Whether it was the karma system, the differentiating dialogue options, and or the vast array of skills, I always felt like I was controlling my own character. Each play through on Fallout New Vegas, and even Fallout 3, felt different in some way or another. Throughout my playthrough in Fallout 4, though, I was constantly reminded that I was some father trying to save his kid (whom of which I never even cared of really). No matter what you do, Bethesda has already made and dictated who your character is. You'll find yourself either being a typical hero, or a cartoonish villian who only cares of himself. That is the only RPG elements that are in Fallout 4.\n- The story overall was lackluster and dissapointing, to say the very least. The characters mostly felt bland in their own unique ways, and the script was also lacking severely. Overall the story is linear, predictable, and unorginal. Avoiding spoilers, the different endings you can have are also extremely weak. Each being a minute or two long cutscene, and that is it. I found myself more entertained watching Dogmeat trying to tackle a deathclaw by himself, than by the storyline itself. Not only all of this, but Bethesda sure fortified its side quests through means of endless radiant objectives, typically consisting of killing ghouls/mutants/bandits.\n- The settlement building is redundant, and fortifies the fact that Fallout 4 is a sandbox/open-world game.. NOT an RPG as it claims to be.\n\nOverall, Fallout 4 is a fun FPS/sandbox game to screw around on, and lose yourself exploring the wasteland. But as an RPG, and as a Fallout game, it is dissapointing tremendously.\nBethesda had 7 years to develop this game to its full potential, yet gave us a half finished product plagued with infinite bugs, and mainstreamed gameplay. The dissapointment I, and many other true RPG/Fallout fans have is unreal, purely.","January 25","false","66.2"," 226 of 351 people (64%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","64","226","351","9","15"

It's why you'll see me having about 160 hours of playtime in this game as it's a dream come true to all Fallout fans who wanted refinement in combat.\n\nThis game however is a blatant insult towards the Bethesda community and everyone who played Fallout 3, New Vegas. I know that people here will think that Fallout New Vegas > 3 or vice versa but that is irrelevant as far as I'm concerned. Both Fallout 3 and New Vegas still gave the player something that Fallout 4 does not.... choice.\n\nProblem #1 Choice\nYou have three choices when talking to someone, you can either be a happy, sarcastic guy, straightforward, or a hard-a** but you still have the same outcome nevertheless. You complete the quest and the good guys win.\n\nI remember back in Fallout New Vegas, I sided with the people of Goodsprings to halt the Powder Gangers.

Then I realized that these guys aren't ordinary bandits but a faction of their own that I am now an enemy of. I then sought to improve their relations but I realized I could've picked another path which in another campaign was to aid the Powder Gangers in securing Goodsprings. My choice actually affected the fate of Goodsprings and my relations with both the village and the Powder Gangers.\n\nThe first thirty minutes of Fallout New Vegas (After customizing your character) had you deciding the fate of Goodsprings. The first thirty minutes of Fallout 4 had you deciding whether to talk smack to Preston Garvey or talk normally to Preston Garvey. I can be cold as hell to Preston and still get his friendship because I am railroaded into beating the bandits. Now of course that's the first thirty minutes but then YOU CAN BECOME THE GENERAL OF THE MINUTEMEN!!! Sounds cool right? Wrong.\n\nProblem #1a - Wasted Potential - Factions\n"General, go help this settlement" "General, there's a settlement that is requesting assistance" "General" "General" "PRESTON HOW ABOUT YOU GO AND HELP THERE! THAT'S AN ORDER!" Oh wait you can't give orders because Preston is actually commander in chief. You're a private with the rank of a general in the Minutemen. There's no way you can give out orders on the map to help secure regions. There's nothing that shows factional control of regions besides just settlement. There are no wars for settlements. There's nothing. Nothing. The only interesting part about the Minutemen is the Defend the Castle quest and even then can be boring.\n\nSame exact problem with Skyrim Civil War and that is, you've got these factions but they're only a color you where and have no interesting mechanics behind them. This one dude was modding the Civil War on Skyrim to make it actually dynamic where you can lose battles and be forced to defend forts of your own, making the game much longer. Factions mean nothing in Fallout 4 besides the armor you where and the one or two quests that are different. It is absoluetly disgusting as well that some people who reviewed Fallout 4 actually compared the faction system in this game to New Vegas's which actually meant something.\n\nProblem #1 Choice (Cont.)\nChoice really doesn't matter but you can shoot stuff which is what I did for about the 80% of the time I played the game.\n\nProblem #2 Story\nThe characters in Fallout 4 are boring, the offer very little meaning when compared to characters from the Witcher 3. I never played a Witcher game until Wild Hunt (I played an quit Witcher 2 in 30 minutes). I felt something when certain events happened in The Witcher because I actually had an attachment to the characters of a story. Good writers will always know how to get the reader/viewer/player attached to a character. It's why RR Martin is hated by fans for killing characters all the time. If Piper died by the De-capitalists, no one would care. In fact, no one would care if everyone died in the game besides the main character, Curie (Robot learning to be human), and Mama Murphy (because we all love her addictive personality).\n\nI know some people talk about how Fallout 4 is a repeat of Fallout 3 with reversed roles but Idk and idc as the story itself is bland anyway. It feels so empty no matter which side you pick because there really is no meaningful epilogue. In fact lol, the epilogue scene is the same for every ending you pick. The dialogue afterward is different granted but compared to other game's (Witcher 3, New Vegas), you don't really have that much to look back and say "yeah, I made that choice.".\n\nProblem #2a  Wasted Potential - A Large Empty Canvas with Nothing to Do\nIt's a big world Fallout 4 is, too bad you can only shoot people or use the settlement builder because everyone on PC loves using the Console version of settlement construction. When you go in to the Combat Zone and see the arena in the middle, everyone thought the same thing. "Gee, I wonder how I can bet and make money from this?" Then the bandits attacked you just as they would anywhere else. How about the robot racing stadium where it's just another bandit location? How about Diamond City? Does it have any activities besides go to this dungeon and kill everybody?\n\nThere's no Gwent, no Caravan, nothing but shooting down hordes of enemies. I just played Doom Beta and I see no difference besides the style of combat.\n\n-----------------------------------------\nNow let's get to why this game may be the game for you.\n\nRedeeming Factor #1 - Shooting\nDo you like shooting people senselessly with little to no care for story? GOOD NEWS, this is the game for you then because I had a blast destroying my enemies in one campaign as a sword wielding psychopath and the other as a marksman. This game has excellent combat in which you can wrestle a deathclaw with your power armor fists, nuke a vertibird, or slice your opponents with precision with melee weapons. One problem you might have with melee is you can no longer target limbs but at the end of the day. YOU ARE A SAMURAI! This isn't meant to be sarcastic for those of you with doubt. If you really enjoy Action more than RPG, you will like this game and I highly recommend it to you.\n\nRedeeming Factor #2 - Mods... well sort of\nAs of the time of this review, there are about 9000 mods alone on Nexus Mod Manager. In just five months, it has almost beaten Fallout 3 and is gaining on Fallout New Vegas. That is really insane because it shows the potential that this game really has if people have modded the game this much. Sure, most of the mods are texture changes but if we take a look at Fallout New Vegas, some modders are making a mod for that game with a freaking drivable TANK! If Fallout 4 is anything similar towards Skyrim, we will see modders add on to the game. The modding potential is there but unfortunately, it cannot fix the problems I stated above and there's always the possibility of Bethesda bringing back Paid Mods and destroy the modding community of Fallout 4.\n\nOverall Score: 6/10\n\nIt's a good action game but an awful RPG and for all RPG fans reading this, buy the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt as that will give you a much better experience than this game. I love RPG's which is why I cannot recommend this game as Fallout has been thought of for sometime as an RPG. Recommending this game would be the wrong thing to do and so I cannot. Doesn't mean it's a bad game in general but it does little to improve the franchise.","April 7","false","222.2"," 150 of 227 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","150","227","3","10"

Its not a bad game per se, but keep your money until next year's christmas. The modders will have to work double shifts to finish this console port.\n\nWith the exception of the first ten minutes and what you saw in the trailers, this review is spoiler free.\n\n\nThe Pro's:\n---------------\n* there's a lot of Fallout in here\n* modding support should be decent since its based on the Skyrim engine\n* the combat feels fluid enough for a RPG\n* ironsights for most guns\n* VATS now slows down time instead of pausing the game (I like it)\n* so far no gamestopping bugs except for constant crashes when I exit the game\n* borderless fullscreen mode\n* Apple/Android app is a nice touch for people who like to have the map open at all times, it works for me\n* animated hair (PhysX?)\n* not a single CTD so far\n* Achievements not working (one of the stupidest reward methods ever conceived), Steam Overlay not working either so probably connected (Edit: Achievements suddenly started working, possibly because I started Steam in Admin Mode or they fixed something, Overlay still not working)\n\n* Dogmeat is kinda useful now, he pins down opponents, occasionally finds loot piles and won't die five minutes after you found him (like he did in Fallout 3)\n* Dogmeat goes into "sneak mode" when you do, looks very cute\n* Dogmeat generally behaves like a "real" dog, he runs away from you to sniff at things, runs ahead or stays back for a bit ... he's no DD yet, but close\n\n* conversations are much more natural than in previous Bethesda games (more than 2 actors involved, actions happening, etc,), but they're bugged to hell, more on that below\n* you can move the camera arround freely during conversations and even run arround, the talker will continue to talk and wait until you focus him again to present your four response options, no more being tidally locked to a single NPC\n\n* interesting armor system (you can strap armor on top of your armor, like shoulderpads)\n* you can use the Minigun from the Power Armor without actually using the Power Armor (weird, but its Fallout)\n* Ghouls have become semi-zombies, some are laying arround like a corpse until they notice you or continue to crawl when their legs are gone, try to jump & bite you without arms\n* talkative enemies taunt you during combat while you fight your way to them, making the shooter part a bit more organic\n* tinkering with your Power Armor feels like working on your own car\n\n* I was sceptical about the voiced protagonist, but the female does a decent job, it will make modding quite a bit harder though\n* If you play the standard female player character (the one shown in the trailers), Piper looks almost exactly like you. I'm not sure if this is intentional, but for RP-reasons I will pretend that she is my grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-grand-niece.\n\n\nThe Con's:\n---------------\n* boring but also rushed prologue/tutorial in the most ugly environment imaginable\n* yes, even more boring than the doctor's questions in F:NV\n* the main plot quickly becomes completly redundant\n* the forced straight marriage spouse and the baby fail to create any emotional attachment to either of them (How could they in the rushed 5 minute prologue?)\n* getting the iconic Power Armor ten minutes into the game is an odd design choice\n* no food/water required, a step back from F:NV\n* "Survival" difficulty has nothing in common with survival games, not even F:NV\n* Stimpacks heal limbs again, and you don't even have to target the broken one, just pop a Stimpack into your arm to grow a new foot\n* not having to train skills to improve in them feels wrong\n\n* the village building is vastly oversimplified (I demolished 3 buildings in 10 seconds, imagine woodchopping in Skyrim without ever swinging your axe) and feels like its been rushed on top of the game for feature creep\n* the village building quickly becomes a chore thanks to the ridiculous UI\n* still the same outworldy "hacking" of computer terminals (guess 4 times, then get locked out, although this time you can retry after 10sec), reminds me of Sudoku\n\n* C-movie quality conversations, at least during the first hours, it gets better the moment you meet Piper but they continue to feel forced and out of place\n* Bethesda took the easy way out of the problem with followers stabbing you in the back, get a perk that disables friendly fire damage, no need to teach Piper *not* to use that Fat Man next to you\n* after spending a few hours with my protagonist, its beginning to feel like she has a split personality, mine (during normal play) and hers (during conversations), extremly limited conversation options are not helping here either\n\n* holstered weapons disappear from existance\n* enemies fall out of the sky, Dragon Age 2-style\n* enemies regulary get stuck, jitter arround, generally bug out\n* legendary enemies are pretty meh ("Legendary Bloatfly" ... uh-huh)\n* cars still got built-in nukes that go off if you look at them funny (it's okay if you like it, I don't)\n\n* extreme loading times even for small buildings, SSDs are a huge help, but still\n* tons of loading screens in general, an engine out of its time\n* ugly, washed out graphics, it could be my imagination but I remember Fallout 3 to be prettier and less cartoon'y for its time\n* FPS rollercoaster, even though my Skyrim runs at constant 60 FPS with 2K textures\n* don't even try to compare Fallout 4's landscape to Skyrim, it will make you weep (not talking green meadows, just detail and atmosphere)\n* wax museum character models\n\n* gigantic, oversized console UI (as usual)\n* literally the most unintuitive UI controls for a PC game of all times, Bethesda tried really really hard to pi** off PC players this time, this goes especially to the Pip-boy handling\n* EVE Online character creator with bonkers Gamepad-turned-into-Keyboard controls\n* dialogs only offer four responses with one trying to be extra-witty, like those dumbed down Bioware RPGs\n* talent tree looks pretty and funny, but also unnessecarily bloated (pro tip: you can scroll down!)\n* most weapons take up a quarter of the screen, I'm not even talking about rocket launchers, just pistols\n\n* loot menu pops up everywhere and ruins immersion, no more opening boxes to see what's inside, especially distracting in combat\n* talking to sleeping people sometimes makes them stand up immediatly, instead of waking and getting up\n* NPCs happily block your way in the best of Bethesda's tradition\n* NPC AI seems to be from the 90's, melee's happily run into minigun fire with a pocket knife, grenades are generally thrown at walls in front of them (incinerating themselves instead of me), animals blindly charge avoid of all fear, etc. pp.\n\n\nEdit: Figured out the console keys on the german keyboard. Its AltGr+Ö.\n\n\nAbout the missing ACHIEVEMENTS, you may want to google it before falling back to kindergarten insults. My Steam Overlay is not working either and its a known problem. One of many.\n\n\nAbout the marriage paragraph, let me quote one comment:\n"Kaiser Fred VIII\nThe fact that you are forced to have a wife isn't a problem of social justice or whatever, the problem is that it forces a backstory on your character. It isn't yours anymore. You can't be a socially recluse engineer living alone, or some widowed businessman or whatever. You *have* to be a married vet with a son. It is not *your* character, it is Bethesda's character. That, combined with a voiced protag, pretty much killed any prospect of replayability and RP in this game to me before I even got my hands on it."\n\n\n\nI think I will stop playing Fallout 4 soon and wait for the modders to eventually fix this console port. Thanks for all the comments, especially the kindergarten-level haters. You guys have inoculated me against anything the internet can throw at me for the next 100 years! :)","November 9, 2015","false","32.9"," 8,285 of 13,542 people (61%) found this review helpful 699 people found this review funny","61","285","13","699","1,033"

Hate me, but if anyone liked the hardcore mode in NV or just weapon degredation in general then they should not get this game. It's definitely the Skyrim of TES series. So you'll have a lot of fun for the first 40 hours, but after that you become an all around unstoppable tank that can use any and all weapons to maximum efficiency. I miss min-maxing a character and seeing my character's strengths grow and his/her weakness become a huge challenge to overcome. The voice acting is nice, but shallows out so much choice. Also there's no reason why I should feel sad for my family or honestly have a desire to go after my son. My character cares but why should I? Other reviews sum it up moreso than I did.

Strictly for the reason of not spoiling anything. Let me tell you that was a colossal mistake. Hopefully someone reading this now will not trust bethesda as I so blindly did.\n\nWhy oh why did they dumb the game down? Simple for money. Sure its rated “M” for mature but here you go kids, its call of duty. Complete with the X when you hit something with bullets, sprinkled with some building tools (more on that in a few). I realize call of duty sells, but this game was different. If I wanted a twitchy shooter game I would have bought one. I can look past this as the two previous 3D games had their fair share of shooting. Call this ball 1\n1-0\nThe building feature of the game is honestly useless to me. Minecraft was a blast but why does every game feel they need to add-on some kind of building feature? Is it to try and say, hey we can do that too? Nope more money. A few prefab buildings and some generic materials to build with just feels tacked on and thrown into the mix. Just for the sake that they can say yeah you can build in this game. Kids will love it so screw the adults who play. Call this strike one.\n1-1\nFallout was also about the choices you made. Those choices are still there but they are too plain now. It was hilarious to read some of the different lines of dialogue in the previous two. You at least knew what your character was going to say but not know the consequences for what you said. With this you get to say this vague positive or negative response nonsense. Essentially for the ignorant people who have no clue how to converse with people in reality. Call this strike two.\n1-2\nGiving the main character a voice was a monumental failure for me. You create your character to resemble yourself right? You spend the time to make them personal, a digital reflection of yourself. Then the game starts and every time your character opens their mouth it takes you out of the game. Call this one strike three, I am outta there!\n1-3\nI gave up on this game well before I was halfway through. I read about how it ends to save me additional torment of this betrayal I experienced. Don't be as naive as I was. Save your money. Hell, with the way video games are going now I can pretty much say its about time for any intelligent experienced gamer to throw in the towel and retire.","January 27","false","6.2"," 142 of 216 people (66%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","66","142","216","6","2"

At this point games like STALKER have more RPG elements than it does (and still beat it at what it's decided its new core focus is), which is telling seeing as STALKER's an open-world FPS and that seems to be the goal of this installment. Interesting sidequests, varied (player) characters and the ability to affect the world take a backseat in favour of... settlement building and Borderlands-style loot grinding.\n\nSure, the movement's less wonky, the shooting's more fluid and the graphics are shinier, but they've been paid for with depth of content and interesting things to do USING those mechanics, which renders the trade a bit of a moot point. Ever want your singleplayer game to feel like an MMO Farcry? Don't delay, buy Fallout 4 today.\n\nA might-have for people who pick up the shiny new box on the shelf but if you were a fan of the previous games you'd be better served waiting for it to go 75% off as there's definitely not £40 fo Fallout here.","January 10","false","262.6"," 166 of 256 people (65%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","65","166","256","6","0"

It's a good adventure FPS, a poor RPG and a bad Fallout. Wish I could give this a neutral rating.\n\nPros\nBetter shooter mechanics. There's no denying this. F3/NV suck in comparison.\nWeapon customisation. When you get your head around it, it's a fun system.\nSound and Music are really great, both in terms of content and their implementation\nGraphics are great, both technically and thematically\nAnimations are much improved from earlier Bethesda titles\nNo more "Arrow in the knee" repetition, random NPCs comments are nicely varied. They even have special lines for certain dates (like December 25)\nThe vertibird and artillery additions are Bethesda seeing popular mods from earlier Fallouts and implementing them into the core game in a way that fleshes out the world. Whilst one could argue both are pointless, they add a nice bit of life to the world.\nI prefer the new power armour system, I think if the original Fallouts could've done something similar, they would have. It fits their presentation in the game lore more accurately.\nNeutral\nSettlement system is interesting, but the explanation is nearly non-existent and the tutorial is a joke. Some serious changes to the game world as you setup dozens of prosperous, populated and linked settlements would've been a nice touch to reward the effort. Occasionally seeing a minuteman patrol or a inter-settlement supply caravan is not much. As it is you mostly do it for its own sake.\nThe junk to build system is interesting, it also helps to serve as a cap sink. It can lead to frustrating amounts of junk hoarding though and there are a illogical breakdowns.\nThe factions and their motivations are interesting. It's clear the BOS in this game is a direct response to all the criticism Bethesda got for changing their ethos in Fallout 3. Neutral point because it's never really fleshed out in any interesting way for any faction, just a stream of glorified "clear the building" quests.\nThe game is buggy. But this is an open world game, so it's to be expected and can't really be held against the game.\nCons\nReduction of every single stat and skill down to the perks system, effectively kills the fun of character customisation. Allowing the rapid acquisition of SPECIAL points makes initial character creation feel meaningless and kills replay value.\nDialogue is almost pointless now, options are severely limited and you don't know what you'll actually say. The walking conversation system leads to lots of bugs with NPCs ending conversations mid-stream or you having to jerk the mouse around to get them to continue.\nQuests are all rail shooter quests. On the rare occasion you get a choice it's almost invariable a black and white choice at the very end of the quest chain. Really crap in comparison to New Vegas's brilliant branching quests (not that it too didn't have its fair share of rail quests, but here that is all we get).\nCompanions are really shallow. I've barely said a dozen sentences to Piper and now she's in love with me? There is no real character arc for any of them and they all join you on a dime.\nThe two characters you're meant to care for the most, your son and wife, are in the game for all of 30 mins and you never develop any connection. I've seen 10 mins cinematics do a better job. The main quest line feels forced as a result. I felt more for the Vault Tec sales guy turned ghoul than my son.\nThe radiant quests are painful. When a settlement has a settler captured for the fifth time, by the same pack of raiders in the same school I've cleared out five times, it gets a little tiresome. They also clog up your quest list, especially if you join BOS, Minutemen and the Railroad.\nBethesda still don't seem to understand that Fallout is set centuries after the nuclear apocalypse. There should be some semblance of a rebuilt society. Exploring the weird way in which societies have rebuilt themselves is half the fun of Fallout 1/2/NV. 200 years and the "jewel of the commonwealth" is a shanty town with 20 people? In this world it seems like the bombs dropped 20 years ago, not 200.\nSummary: it's still worth the money and it is a good game for what it is: an adventure FPS. This review would be positive if they'd just remove Fallout from the title. As they won't I will judge it as a Fallout game, in which case it is a disappointment.\n\nFallout was all about meaningful character development, fun interactive conversations and varied interesting quests, this game has none of these.","November 13, 2015","false","67.0"," 1,252 of 2,047 people (61%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","61","252","2","45","44"

If your looking for the magic of past games in the Fallout series this offering doesn't have it.\n\nPros:\n-- Combat is smoother then previous versions.\n\nCons:\n-- Companions only add value as pack animals. They often trigger fights when you don't want to start, or walk infront of you while your in combat, getting them shot in the back. While trying to sneak around they are constantly bumping in to you or blocking your movement.\n-- Combat is repetitive. The engaugement themes are few. 1 you snipe mobs, 2 your dropped into a small area with a hard mob and have to play run and gun till it's dead. 3 The enemy hurls explosives at you over and over and over.\n-- Progression You become very powerful very fast.\n-- Quests Mostly boring, go here (encounter some crap on the way) find x, or kill y return.\n-- Settlements Interesting at first, but mostly just a mini-game with a poor interface and no instructions.\n-- Crafting Build yourself awesome gear/guns too easy.\n-- Perks and Special, ruined and interface is horrid.\n\nFinal thoughts:\nI loved this franchise, but this smells of a cashout. With all the time between installments I'd have expected ground breaking improvements or atleast the same quality as previous offerings. If and when the next in the series comes out, I won't blindly buy it, will wait for the reviews. If you like shooting things and not much more then this is the game for you.

The direction Bethesda is taking the Fallout franchise is a direction leading it away from what made the franchise great in the first place. This isn't an RPG, it's an openworld sandbox with lite RPG elements and for the content provided it isn't worth the price tag.\n\nI first played Fallout at Christmas, 1997. I thought the game was amazing and I wasn't the only one. It was said back then that Fallout 1 effectively "saved" the RPG, without Fallout 1 & 2 there would've been no Baldurs Gate (a game that was later itself said to have saved the cRPG, but without the success of F1 & 2 for Black Isle, neither they nor Interplay would've published Baldurs Gate). Both Fallout 1 and 2 were praised not for their bloodthirsty action or exploration (although those were still very prominent things in the game) but for their emphasis on character development and player decision making. In Fallout 1 and 2 there were decisions and quests (all optional) that you could undertake which could see the story of settlements change forever; want to help a crimelord take over Junktown? Go ahead! or maybe you want to help the Mayor, MacGuyver, take the crimelord down by bugging his office. In Fallout 2 the decisions became even grander in scale; you could help unify (in a way) Vault City, a racist borderline nazi settlement with Gecko, a Ghoul settlement that sprang up around a nuclear power plant (which they made operational, mostly) but the alliance was all really a ruse by a giant intelligent molerat and his plans for world domination.\nThis is something that since Fallout 3 has been eroded by Bethesda; instead of enhancing the character development and adding to the effects of player decision & how it impacts the world, they are "streamlining" them; marketing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t for removing and dumbing-down. Fallout 3 and New Vegas still offered some player choice in certain circumstances, although it was often an all or nothing choice (press the button yourself! make sarah lyon press the button!). Fallout 4 however offers no real choice; conversations are often only able to be progressed by a single option, the others just give you a new line which has no bearing upon the outcome, quests are almost universally only accomplished a single way and the majority of the quests are clear&fetch, or even just "clear the zone!" quests.\nWhere's the intrigue in Diamond City? Why do I have to wait until the game is basically over to prove the Mayor is a synth? Why is there no dynamic quest allowing you to investigate his potential "lineage", bug his office, interrogate his aides and lackeys, and inevitably lead to his "malfunction" while giving a speech and finally having to take him down to prevent a massacre?\nOr resolving it "peacefully" by revealing him to the people before he malfunctions and in a decidedly dark twist which fits with the Fallout universe they smash him up and leave his body hanging outside the main gate? (And this quest line, I thought up as I typed it, in under a minute; surely your writers can come up with something better, Bethesda?). Why no questline helping a group of raiders find a way into Diamond City through a forgotten fire escape, or working against them on behalf of Diamond City?\nThere's so much potential for storytelling in Bethesda's Fallouts which isn't seized upon due to laziness within the development of the product. It's far easier to cut this stuff out and give us something that, at least to me, feels incomplete and half-baked.\n\nI like this game, I really do, but it isn't a Fallout RPG. It's a Fallout openworld sandbox, with some lite RPG elements, but it isn't an RPG, it doesn't have the soul of the franchise anymore; and that's a sad thing. I used to be a huge Bethesda fanboy, from Arena on up through, I've spent the past 3 (almost 4) years developing a total conversion of CK2 based in their Elder Scrolls universe but now... I'll probably buy their next Elder Scrolls game, but it won't be a preorder, or a first-day purchase, I'll wait for the €4.99 "Complete" edition in a christmas sale, their games aren't worth more than that to me anymore.","December 12, 2015","false","191.4"," 205 of 322 people (64%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","64","205","322","6","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jones/recommended/377160/","Jones","Inspector Jones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jones/","495 products in account","Fallout 4 is a great game with its own flaws and shortcomings. On offer is a great new sandbox to explore, scavenge, and survive in with great mechanics, both new and refined, that keeps you going for just "a couple more minutes" only to realize that it's almost 4 o'clock in the morning. Fallout 4 feels like it's all about hoarding items (Every item now has some gameplay use) and the process of acquiring those items are more fun then ever thanks to improved shooting mechanics and a rewarding weapon modding system that helps instill more value and personal attachment to your equipment.\n\nHowever, Fallout 4 has taken a step back in the role playing department. Gone are the skill checks for dialogue options from the New Vegas only to be replaced by a Bioware style conversation tree and voiced main character. At best, the story is a step up from Fallout 3 and a cast of interesting companions helps to keep things interesting. But at the end of the day, this is a step back in the freedom of approaching quests your own way and serves to only limit the player.\n\nFallout 4 is safe bet for anyone who loves the exploration aspects of the modern games (FO3 and NV), combat, and crafting and don't mind or prefer the approach to story. For anyone who really, really values the roleplaying aspects that are lost then safely pass on Fallout 4 or wait to see what mods will bring to the table.","November 16, 2015","true","99.3"," 423 of 686 people (62%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","62","423","686","15","10"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nakyrules/recommended/377160/","nakyrules","N A K Y","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nakyrules/","441 products in account","First, allow me to say - while this isn't a terrible game but I must also very quickly say that it is not a good game either. Fans of this series waited 5 years for this game to come out since Fallout New Vegas and the expectations were high and while it's reasonable to say that all these expectations could not have been met, I cannot help but be fully disappointed with the state they shipped this game out.\n\nLet's get it over with: there are so many things wrong with this game so let's go over them.\n\nThe AI is atrocious. It hasn't improved even a little bit since Fallout 3, back in 2008. Zero improvements in the AI in 7 years. Enemies will ignore cover, they will run at you (and sometimes past you) and they will spam unlimited grenades at you that WILL land on your head every single time. Just like before, if you snipe enemies from a long enough distance, they run around in a circles as until they die or until they luck out and magically manage to discover the direction you're shooting from. Your own followers are terrible in combat and will often not be able to hit a single thing they're shooting at and die rather quickly. There's virtually no reason to use anyone other than the dog, simply because at least the dog can haul down enemies and insta-kill low health enemies for you among his other abilities... like breaking through master locks to hand you items inside them.\n\nThe plot is awful. No, it's straight up awful. It's the exact same plot as Fallout 3 except this time you're the dad looking for the son. You're given power armor and a minigun in the first 15 minutes of gameplay by people who have no reason to trust you what-so-ever after what they've gone through. Roleplaying? Nope, you're a good guy. Oh sure, you get some sarcastic responses and you can turn down a quest if you feel like not getting a reward, but the game all but forces you to be a 'good guy' who fights for the 'good guys', as if some guy frozen for 200 years and given no reason to trust anyone or anything afterwards would automatically know who they are. You will not ever be helping the raiders, nor is it even an option at any point in the game.\n\nWhich brings me to the next point, the voiced dialog and response system. Boy, it sure is fun guessing what my character will say with a four point prompt: Yes, No, Sarcastic, Question? But really, it doesn't matter in the end anyway. Any key decisions will have you railroaded into what you're 'supposed' to be doing anyway and for everything else it's just a matter of accepting or declining a side quest. The voice acting is awful and the male PC character always sounds bored or detached. I haven't heard the female voice acting yet so can't comment on that. And on another note, for the hearing impaired, the subtitles routinely don't match the dialog and the game's subtitling system routinely breaks and will get stuck on a paragraph of dialog while the conversation moves on. Just one small bug in a long, long list of them. And believe me, the amount of bugs and glitches that are in this game are staggering.\n\nFor PC users, this is a console port and it's a mediocre one. There are some keys you can't rebind and I honestly can't remember the last triple A game that didn't let you do this. There's no FOV slider either, which will make using the power armor a chore as its UI takes up a full 1/3 of your total screen space and any weapon larger than a pistol take up a full 1/4 of your screen space in or out of the armor. Fog looks terrible and the textures are low-res even on the highest settings. Skyrim looked a bit dated when it came out in 2011 and four years later it hasn't aged any better. The last open world RPG I played was Witcher 3 and this thing looks abysmal in comparison.\n\nAll this being said, this game is what it is which is Fallout 3.5, 7 years after 3 came out. Running around killing, looting and exploring is the same as it was then and so if you enjoyed that then I see no reason why you wouldn't enjoy that aspect of the game in this either. But shame on Bethesda for releasing a game like this and shame on everyone defending it. If it wasn't Fallout 4, if it wasn't Bethesda that made it, this game would be destroyed by gaming media and gamers a-like. The excuses of 'well, mod makers will fix it' is unacceptable. I am one of those mod makers and I shouldn't have to help fix a game I paid 70 dollars for because a lazy billion dollar game development company doesn't feel the need to improve its products.\n\nIn conclusion, this game is not worth its full price. There are many better games out right now for that money and Bethesda is falling further behind the rest of the game industry with every game release. It's time, fellow gamers, for us to stop making excuses for Bethesda and start demanding better games from them instead of this lazy tripe they keep throwing at us.","November 14, 2015","false","13.3"," 1,455 of 2,402 people (61%) found this review helpful 72 people found this review funny","61","455","2","72","79"

IN A FALLOUT TITLE!! HOW DO YOU SCREW UP YOUR CORE MECHANICS SO MUCH! There's NO cool loot ANYWHERE thanks to the customization system- you will have every weapon in the game within about 2 hours, power armor is a chore, etc. The locations have ALMOST NO story whatsoever! All of the loot is things like "Rifle with attachment 3, 4 and 8", all of which you can make yourself!\n\n*NO COOL LOOT OR STUFF. They cut out unique items in favor of customization (all of which you can do from your base)- ALL THE COOL ITEMS ARE GONE.\n\n* Constant stupid combat. The amount of gunfighting is just unnecessary, and the gunfighting itself  is boring.\n\n*The quests are JUST SO BORING. There's only like 3 interesting ones in the whole game!\n\n* Absolutely stupid difficulty system. There are enemies that take about 30 seconds of continous gunfire at point-blank distance to kill, using endgame weapons on Easy. These enemies happen about once every 10 minutes and are completely unfun.\n\n* Dialog SUCKS. Badly written, badly acted, boring subjects! I could almost NEVER respond the way I wanted!\n\n* Story is blander than Unfrosted Cheerios. I didn't care about my son, at all.\n\nI could go on, but the randomly generated (read: boring) quest maker tells me there's another settlement that needs your help, I'll mark it on your map.

From fallout 1 to fallout 4 and everything in between.\nI also understand times are changing. Play styles and the market are totally different to what they used to be.\n\nThis game is a GOOD game, Infact. It's a fantastic GAME, however, This is NOT a GOOD or even a NICE Fallout title. The RPG elements have been anything but eradicated from the game. Dialog options are lazy and misguided. Combat is based on an FPS, From an RPG point of view this game is simply a post-apocalyptic FPS with ability scores. There's no Karma, No roleplaying, No skills, You can use every gun in the game regardless of strength stats, Intelligence is practically useless due to the way the new perk system has been implelemted which, in my opinion feels rushed too. The perks themselves are good they're on the right track. but this game doesn't feel like fallout. it doesn't play like fallout it feels even less like fallout than New Vegas and 3. But this game drops the penny.\n\nIn conclusion, If you want to play this game in an RPG sense, I wouldn't buy it. It's very difficult to roleplay this game.\nIf you want a game where you can walk in, blow ♥♥♥♥ up, Shoot things from a mile away and watch it run circles around it's programmed area. Buy this game. Because that's all it feels like. Again. This is my personal opinion. I'm very much into RPGing games. Which is why i enjoyed Fallout 1/2/3 so much. Despite that. I've finished this game on the hardest difficulty and frankly it falls short on many occasions.\n\nI personally haven't ran into any game breaking bugs, At least none that werent fixed by simply reloading my game. There are however things in this game i have found to be gamebreaking. Like the ability to find the best weapons in the game within the first hour of the game. This specifically and a few other issues i personally have with the game have rendered me unable to enjoy my time playing.\n\nHopefully this review helps some people who may be a bit "on the fence" about buying this.

My first Fallout game was 3 and I enjoyed it, and I loved New Vegas even more (it's pretty high on my favorite games of all time). I also enjoyed skyrim a bunch.\n\nI expected Bethesda to take what Obsidian did with New Vegas, bring it in and make it better. I didn't see much of it in the trailers, and honestly the disappointment started to sink in... starting with the shoddy development of the dialogue wheel. I also noticed how skills were absent, but I still had hope that the rest would be just fine and that there was good reason.\n\nI purchased the game on release, downloaded it, and started it up. Immediately I had concerns about graphic customization, being that it was far less sophisticated than what I could do with New Vegas and Fallout 3. Still, I pushed on with hopes that it would all work out fine... Then I started my game and saw the opening video, which in my opinion was excellently done and really hooked me. I also loved the idea of being someone who existed in the pre-war era who experiences the apocalypse 200 years later. While it was rushed, I realized that it was to keep the pacing. The face creation system is as good as it's ever been, but it's a bit vague.\n\nFrom there on to exiting the vault, I was in love... that love sunk faster than the Titanic shortly after. Now I'm going to break the game down...\n\nVisuals and Sounds: This is as good as Fallout has ever looked, but we all knew that they were re-using the same engine, so it wasn't exactly top notch. It basically looks as good as New Vegas with ENBs and a ton of texture packs. The faces are also as good as Fallout has looked, along with some of the better animations I've seen Bethesda crop up. Soundwise it was spot on, music again was nicely done kind of resembling Fallout 3. This is the game's best part\n\nCombat: This is arguably Bethesda's biggest improvement... Gunplay is as good as ever, and the power armor system is awesome. The weapon modification system is solid AF, wonderful job there. Sadly this seesm to be where Beth devoted their time. Armor modifications do make sense, but I am disappointed by how they got rid of damage threshhold.\n\nGameplay: Now this is where it goes wrong. Immediately I notice that there's no option for hardcore mode, one of my favorite additions to New Vegas. Also, the karma/reputation system is absent.... This arguably one of the biggest sins I've seen.. Karma was flawed, but it was a system that made sense in an RPG, and reputation was another great addition by Obsidian. With those gone, I feared for how RPG mechanics in general would turn out. This also came through in leveling. Perks are now purely combat, and half of them are as useless as the ones in Fallout 3. It's clear, also, that you can max everything out fairly quickly with no trouble, and that's what frustrates me about an RPG as it eliminates the idea of playing to a certain style.\n\nDialogue: I dedicated this entire section to my frustration with it. The dialogue wheel is one of the worst additions to Fallout. While it worked in Mass Effect, it's poorly done here. All you get is 4 options in every conversation with the same results: Yes, No, Sarcastic/Info, Maybe. It's disgraceful, and we don't even get to see what we're about to say, which forces us to rely on the voice action. The dialogue writing as well is completely one-dimensional, boring, and almost cringeworthy. When I heard the whole crap of "destiny" from that stoner grandma, I knew I was in for another cliche-ridden crap fest.\n\nStory: And here's where I continue. Having the motivation ofl ooking for the player's son is good, but that motivation is gone when presented with a bunch of crap from other characters. The characters are clearly another step down, reverting to the black/white dilemma of good versus evil. I know it gets into the whole idea of synths versus humans and morality, but at the moment the momentum is just dead. Oh, and if you notice, it's practically the same story as Fallout 3, and Skrim, and a bunch of other Bethesda games: find what you los I know, Bethesda isn't known for crafting great stories, but that's what Fallout is all about: the great story of the apocalypse. You're the next chapter. Also, you get the power armor at level 2... What kind of game design is that? Power armor used to be a reward, something you aspired to get. Practically, you're playing Bethesda's character at this point, not your own...\n\nRPG: This doesn't even deserve a section because this game has shifted from RPG with shooter mechanics to Shooter with RPG mechanics. Instead of innovating, Bethesda gutted what I loved about Fallout and took the Role Playing out of RPG. You can trace this back to after morrowind though that they've been doing this. This actually starts at the well-written beginning, because you're railroaded to be either a useless wife or a vet whom both are parents and are "WERE ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY I MUST DO THIS CAUSE ITS NECESSARY FOR MY KID" in every conversation no matter what you do thus creating a split persona between you and the character you're playing, which nullifies the idea of "being whoever you want". The fact that you get your own faction in the span of 30 minutes is another insult... If my character gets follows that quickly no matter my Charisma, then I must be Hitler. Additionally, Pretty much every quest is fetch this, shoot that, go there. This continues my rant about dialogue in that we don't get to use attribues (special) for dialogue, nor any skills. All that affects dialogue is charisma, instead of using other attributes to affect what we say (Intelligence for smarts, strength for bruteness, etc). This goes hand in hand with the lack of the awesome reputation system from New Vegas, which made you want to get in bed with some people and kill others.  You could almost call this false advertising because RPG values are like ghosts here.\n\nCompanions: I like how fluid the dog works and moves, but I'm missing the companion wheel because it was so convenient and effective. A lot of what you can do with the dog is useless and distracting, so it's just there to run around and chew on ♥♥♥♥. The problem is that having a companion is annoying because it's hard to track them and they end up doing dumb stuff, like before, which you can't prevent.\n\nCrafting: A great idea, but this exposes a HUGE mechanical flaw... bethesda forces you to use the arrow keys rather than allowing you to re-bind them. Clearly, this shows the game was ported from consoles. Poor move\n\nThere's so much more I want to touch up on, but my frustration with the game can only be put into so many words. I already got my re-fund, and will not re-purchase Fallout 4 unless it goes on a huge sale and there are mods to fix this. All in all, I love Fallout, but this is a huge bummer. Not a bad game, but it's definitely mediocre and easily the weakest fallout game. If I can find a word to describe it, it's disappointing. If you want to play this game, I highly recommend doing the same and waiting for a sale.\n\nEDIT: For those of you who are downvoting me merely because I'm downvoting the game, I'm sorry that I didn't give your game the obligatory 420/69 because it's fallout. I forgot I'm supposed to blindly accept whatever Bethesda throws my way.\n\nAnd for those of you who are saying 4 hours isn't enough time, believe me it was. If you can't get a solid opinion on a game in that timeframe then you just have issues. And even if I played longer, I guarantee you that you all would be like "DERR THEN WHY DO U PLAY IF U DON LIKE IT" can't have it both ways. But to satisfy your rage, I watched a few more hours worth of videos on the game, and I still was not impressed. I even watched my friend play it on the PS4 and we both realized the truth: Fallout 4 is an utter disappointment\n\nPlease enjoy the show in the comments, because the ragers have arrived.","November 10, 2015","false","3.9"," 2,145 of 3,571 people (60%) found this review helpful 89 people found this review funny","60","145","3","89","568"

And when your dialog options are almost always boiled down to “Yes, No, Sarcastic Yes, More Info” it’s doubly infuriating when you choose ‘No’ and the NPC goes, “Well whatever, do it anyway.” Then your quest updates for you to take the next step, regardless of your input, and sits there waiting for you to come back to. And that’s not Fallout. That’s a bad RPG. No means no, Bethesda.\n\nBut my feelings for this game can be really be summed up by the in-game quest “Confidence Man”\n\nTravis, the Diamond City Radio DJ in Fallout 4, objectively, isn’t very good. He has anxiety attacks mid broadcast, at one time screaming “Oh God we’re gonna die!” (which honestly kept me chuckling every time I heard it).\n\nThen, after completing a quest line to give Travis more confidence, I realized I immediately regretted doing so. Travis had simply become a generic radio DJ. The goofy DJ, full of personality, was gone.\n\nThat’s what Fallout 4 is. Fallout wasn’t perfect, but it had personality and I loved it. Fallout 4 is a distraction that ultimately leaves a bad taste in your mouth.","December 7, 2015","false","50.9"," 113 of 173 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","113","173","3","2"

I didn't get that. Instead, I got an action-adventure FPS with an FPS perk system.\n\nIf I wanted to play an FPS, I'd play Arma II, or Insurgency, or even CS:GO and I HATE THAT GAME!\n\nTHIS is not what I buy a Fallout for. I do not buy it for the gunplay. I do not buy it for a voice protagonist. I do not buy it for crafting.\n\nI buy it because I like roleplaying. I like imagining what my past was and what my future will be. I like creating an archetype for my character to follow, with certain weapons to use and certain quests to take and do, evil or good.\n\nI can't be evil, only good. I can't make a character archetype or niche, because my perks and stats will all be maxed after I play long enough. Hell, there are only a few perks that are even interesting, while the rest are simply percentage buffs. That's not engaging, and that certainly is not an RPG.\n\nWant an alright FPS? Go ahead and get it, it's pretty alright I guess. More customisation than any other FPS on the market, so you should enjoy that.\n\nBut if you want an RPG? Play Fallout 3, play New Vegas, play Oblivion or Morrowind or Mass Effect or even Dragon Age. Play Witcher. Hell, play Stardew Valley. But this is no RPG, and if that's what you want, then this is not where you want your money going.","May 15","false","143.2"," 339 of 552 people (61%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","61","339","552","12","12"

The beautifully crafted world (which thankfully doesn't look brown for the majority of it) is packed with details, and it will compel you to spend quite some time in it. Whenever you stumble upon a deserted town, or exterminate an entire raider camp, you'll either be left wondering how everything was like before the bombs fell, or read small stories of the woes and struggles of others before you (or both). Point in case is, the world is just as rich as you'd expect from a Bethesda game, and you'll be sinking in a lot of time trying to discover every nook and cranny of it. There are other pros to this game, but I'd like to let you discover and experience them on your own. However I think it’d be important to get the cons out of the way right now.\n\nThe dialogue tree is by far the worst offender. Limited to 4 options at a time, and no clear sentences or subtitles displaying what your character will actually say when choosing a dialogue branch, feels oversimplified and really takes away from the Fallout experience. The dialogue camera, while better (no lock-on mode like it used to be in Skyrim), still has some issues when switching to "cinematic" mode (which would usually be a minor nuisance, but it does break the flow). NPCs are a lot duller too, and I found that talking to them again after the initial first time, will get you stuck in the same dialogue over and over (not an issue only Bethesda suffers from, but their games suffer from it the most).\n\nWhile the crafting system is a welcoming addition (especially for people who aren’t comfortable with modding their games, and y’know… console players), after sinking 2-3 days straight into the crafting system - building an outpost in sanctuary (take a look at my screenshots to see the result) – it ultimately did fall short on a number of occasions. There are a lot of assets missing that are almost a basic necessity for buildings (no windows, inner walls and doorways and no bathroom sinks). The controls are okay, but for someone who has used Skyrim’s Creation Kit, it did feel extremely basic and limited. There’s also a building limit, so don’t expect to turn Sanctuary into a metropolis when playing a vanilla game (I had to change the maximum building limit with console commands in order to get my Sanctuary to look like the way it looks now). Nevertheless, if you’re willing to dive into the crafting system, you’ll be pleasantly surprised, and it’ll be a good window for anyone interested to make their own mods (until the G.E.C.K. comes out that is), but not without overcoming certain hurdles.\n\nAs a conclusion, I’d say that if you enjoy Bethesda games, then you’ll enjoy Fallout 4. If you enjoyed Fallout 1 and 2, but also enjoyed Fallout 3 and New Vegas, you’ll enjoy Fallout 4. Even if you only enjoyed Skyrim, you’ll enjoy Fallout 4. If you only enjoyed Fallout 1 and 2, and think Bethesda is ruining the Fallout franchise because “ermagerd Bethesda are sucking on casuals and console plebs”, then though luck, Bethesda owns the franchise and does what it wants with it, and it certainly doesn’t look like they have any intention of going back to isometric Fallout 1 and 2 gameplay. My point is: don't let the die-hard Fallout fanboys coerce you into not-buying this game (unless you're a die-hard fan yourself, lol). The game is Bethesda’s latest and greatest, and aside from some issues and the dialogue wheel, you’ll be thoroughly enjoying the latest installment to the Fallout franchise.","November 14, 2015","true","213.2"," 697 of 1,153 people (60%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","60","697","1","31","8"

This is a fun fps grinder with great mechanics akin to bl2. But it should not have been called Fallout - it is a disservice to the lineage of the series. This game is too magoo and lacks the grit and dark edge. This game is what Doom 4 would have become had the soul of the Doom 4 project not been called into question: a cinematic crowd pleaser. For this game to wear the fallout title, it needs a soul. I've played around 196 hours in an effort to find that fallout soul, I cannot find it. It is not all bad however: out the box, it has gun crafting and amazing shooter mechanics and a big detailed map. Thats all I have.\n\nMy main gripe: the main character crowds the player out, the the dialogue is uninteresting and dumbed down. Fallout, especially new vegas, had an interesting dialogue system that kept the player engaged and interested as well as a highly connected faction system with cause and effect. If you enjoyed that about NV, write this off in F4 - dialogue merely serves a 'rail quest' system to push the story along.\nFollowed by: The character system can be chucked out the window - this game is built for grinding considering everything is a perk and no character is fixed in their initial creation trajectory. By level 45+, you are a god - even with difficulty on very very hard. You can become anything late game.\nLastly: A side quest drought gives little incentive to explore the wasteland. What am I looking for? More things to shoot?\nIn summary - the RPG element is dead in contrast to where this series comes from. This is an FPS first and foremost.\n\nOn a positive note: Bethesda have again created a platform which offers a diverse array of mechanics and functionality with which the community will make good use of. This has always been one of the games saving graces - a dedicated modding community that effectively take the fallout games and create an experience closer to home. Already, some of the lighting presets improve the games atmosphere considerably to a point where I wished I had had them setup on my first and only play through.\n\nIn summary: if you like Fallout - either invest into a new RPG franchise or wait and see what dlc comes or what the modding community come up with in 6 months. This can be Fallout but only with the help of the modding community. I recommend Underrail, not only for 'crazy die hard fans' but for anyone desperate for an RPG. Underrail is more Fallout than Fallout 4.","December 28, 2015","false","239.1"," 74 of 108 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","74","108","0","0"

Imagine you go to this bar every Saturday. Every time you grab a drink and you notice this girl. This girl is your dream girl, the kind of girl that you picture when someone asks you what the perfect woman looks like. You realize quickly however that she’s got to be a figment of your imagination. Girls like that don’t exist. So you settle for girls more in your wheelhouse. You have fun with these girls but then, all of a sudden, you get on a really bad streak. Every girl you’ve tried to be with for the last few years has been a major letdown. They look incredibly promising, and you put your heart and soul into them, but they all turn out to have a ton of fatal flaws in them that were very well hidden.\n\nBut then….one day as you’re sitting at that bar, thinking this might be the end of days, that girl, the one from the beginning comes over and sits with you. She introduces herself and says she’s noticed you before but hasn’t had the courage to say anything to you till today. Things are going swimmingly! You’re on Cloud ♥♥♥♥ing 9, this girl is not only real, but she’s everything you could’ve dreamed of and more! So you guys part ways and all you can think of is this girl. For months you see her very very briefly, but each time it gets that much sweeter. She somehow gets better every time you see her and all you want to do is hold her in your arms and never let her go.\nFinally….she tells you she wants you to come over to her place. You tense up, your palms start to sweat, your face is flush, are your knees shaking?! Is this really happening? You buy a new wardrobe to make yourself presentable, put on your finest cologne, get a haircut, you look better than you have ever before in your life. You even spent around 400 dollars on a nice gift for this girl to make a good impression. Was it really worth 400 dollars? Of course it was! Anything for this girl. You get giddier and giddier with each passing day until finally, after all these months. The day comes around on the calendar….November 10’th 2015.\n\nWhen you arrive, everything seems to be wonderful! It’s everything you could’ve ever wanted. She’s beautiful, charming, funny, but….something seems just a bit off. Is….is that a bulge in her pants? Is that a handlebar mustache? How the hell did you not notice these things before? Were you that blinded with anticipation?!! You get a knot in the pit of your stomach upon realizing that once again, you’ve been fooled. This beautiful girl that you once thought was your dream come true, is nothing but a mischievous transvestite that fooled you into believing that you’d ever find true love.\nNow you’re probably thinking…”Dude, what the ♥♥♥♥ does this have to do with Fallout 4?”\nYou see my dear reader, this is the best metaphor I could think of for how Fallout 4 destroyed me, how it deceived me into believing that any game these days is worth the hype.\n\nNow then….now that you’ve read my long ♥♥♥ metaphor, I’ll be truthful about this game, and about me\n\nI’ve been a fan of the Bethesda Fallout games for a long time now as I’m sure a lot of you have. Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas are some of the greatest games ever made in my opinion. I’ve literally put more hours into Fallout New Vegas than any other game I’ve ever played, and believe me it’s a lot of hours (My steam hours are nothing compared to all the time on Xbox) So as years went by and the modding communities began to die down for Fallout NV especially, you got the feeling that the next Fallout game had to be coming out eventually. Hell I followed it for years from that fake Survivor website that sprung out of the blue, to the random ♥♥♥ articles on Korean websites, literally any bit of info I could find on the internet on an almost daily basis. This was routine for at least 3 years, till finally, the initial trailer for Fallout 4 dropped. Obviously the internet imploded, fans everywhere cried out in joy, Fallout 4 was finally coming soon!\nI remember watching the E3 conference with a buddy of mine back in June. It was breathtaking. I probably rewatched it about 50 some odd times afterwards leading up to Fallout 4’s release. The next morning I pre-ordered the “Pipboy Edition” (The highly sought after collectors edition) I also went out and bought a bunch of Fallout merchandise including hoodies, t-shirts, mugs, and other accessories. Then when the game became available for digital preordering I bought myself a copy and my buddy I watched the press conference with. So all in all you can imagine how much money that was.\n\nThe week leading up to November 10’th was the longest week of my life, and I mean that. I can’t think of anything else that has ever had me writhing in agony for something like Fallout 4 did. And then….finally, it was here. Me and my buddy stayed up for the midnight launch and played through the beginning together, made our characters, and then once we left the vault, we parted our skype call for the next 10 or so hours while we each played and explored. However, right off the get go, after that initial cutscene played, I knew something was up. It got ever worse once I started exploring. The knot in my stomach was terrible, I literally almost vomited after a while. I kept trying to tell myself that I’m just nervous and I need to play more, so I did. It didn’t get better, not even once.\nThis game….is not a Fallout game, it’s not an RPG, it’s….it’s nothing as advertised.\nFor an open world RPG game that apparently started its earliest stages of development “Right after Fallout 3” according to Todd Howard, this game is ♥♥♥♥ing terrible. There is so little content in this game it’s astounding! I completed every single sidequest, the main story, found almost every unique weapon and piece of armor, and explored the entire map in barely 100 hours. Mind you, I wasn’t rushing. I took my sweet ♥♥♥ time, and as a Fallout fan I looked in every nook, every cranny, every crevice as I explored this new wasteland. You can imagine how much of a bummer that was to me.\n\nAll in all I’ll go ahead and sum things up since this review is getting a tad long,\n\nThis game improves on the combat, animations, and voice acting\nIt is worse than its previous games when it comes to its story, sidequests, unique weapons, tone, characters, overall content, and most importantly….Fun. This game, is just not fun.\n\nI had more to say, but steam gives reviews a character limit, but I think you all get my point, this game ruined me.\n","January 9","false","103.3"," 296 of 481 people (62%) found this review helpful 58 people found this review funny","62","296","481","58","49"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chudje/recommended/377160/","Chudje","Crum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Chudje/","87 products in account","Fallout 4 is in no way a good bethesda game. I have played this game for about 180 hours so far and have been disappointed beyond belief that people can accept this game into the fallout franchise.\n\nThe simplistic nature of the dialogue system is very saddening for two reasons. The first being is you don't know what your character is  going to say, The game giving you the option of things like "Impressed" or "sarcasm" is very frustrating because you don't know what they are going to say or the tone. The second part about the dialogue system is that it gives you the usual options of a good response, mean, helpful and even with these basic responses don't really change how they respond or change the situation at hand where in other fallout games you could your choices of speech actually changed the situations and the smallest choices could change the game where fallout 4 fails to do so.\n\nThe voiced protagonist is stupid. I hope there's a dlc where your mouth gets shot and the player can actually choose between more than 4 options. I don't need someone else to feel the emotion for me when I respond, I don't need it vocalized.\n\n\nFallout 4 also lacks content. I can't remember a time in new vegas or skyrim where I did not have a quest at hand. Fallout 4 at this point I only have repeatable side quests. and at only 180 hrs in. But i know what your thinking. "isnt 180 hours worth of content good though?" not for this game. The amount of time I have actually liked playing this game is minimal. About a third of my time I have been building settlements. Settlements are like chores. There not fun for you because they are too small to make something you find cool, and it just takes a while to get enough stuff to make your settlers happy, by the way settlers are useless they provide nothing but decoration and people to work your shops that don't give a good return rate. About 20% of the game is spent on item management. and the final part is the actual game. In skyrim and fallout nv I remember finding great places exploring finding cool quests here and there. This game has little of that. The map is so cramped I could go from one end to another in little time, and many places copy and pasted the same enimies: Raiders, SuperMutants, Gunners, Synths. Just those four things over and over and over It would have been nice to add a few more towns and enemy factions just so it has variety, but it just seems all the same. When you complete the game for the first time you see ending cinematic and kind of think it cheesy and stupid, But when you finish it with another group it's basicly the same, There's almost no difference with the endings, and there's so little endings. The quests are quite boring and predictable. Fallout 4 does not feel like an rpg, I don't fully understand why the rpg tag is set to this game.\n\nSettlements are a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ mechanic. As I said before they are like chores. You get everything good for your settlers than yourself, You need to always look out for stuff just so you have enough to make another turret or food, or beds. And there is no reward they give you almost nothing the best use for them is shops. which don't give a good return rate. The settlements don't give you good quests there are no cool characters that you can have a conversation with most people are just the same. The settlements are lacking a lot, there's no reason to go back to them unless they are being raided, and the settlements just feel like an unfinished mechanic.\n\nThe building of the settlments are buggy as ♥♥♥♥. When it tries to snap to other objects you often have to take more time then it should configuring where to place your mouse how much rotation it should have even if its as simple as a floor. The furniture and decoration variety is not much. You can end up being alright with what you get, But more to choose from would have been cool. And when it comes to farms, Seal them off, your turrets and settlers will just shoot through the crops and just makes the extra task of repairing the crops.\n\nThe load screens are long enough that you can ♥♥♥♥ing die of old age,\nand the bugs are enough that you have to reset your computer every 2 hours.\n\n\nOverall I would say I had about 30 hours of enjoyment with this game the other 150 hours were hoping it would turn into a fallout game.\n\nUI is optomized for Controllers, I dont blame bethesda on this one they were probably paid to make it that way.\n\nI think im just going to forget about this game and pretend it did not happen because it was just a setback in bethesda development.","December 7, 2015","false","212.1"," 116 of 179 people (65%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","65","116","179","10","0"

Action, voice acting, graphics, the scale of the game all got improved. But the missing RPG elements keep most of those improvements held back.\n[ + ] Gameplay got the major overhaul it needed. You can now run, peek over corners to shoot, and use melee and grenades at any time. Also you can see what's inside a container by looking at it, making looting quick and easy.\n\n[ + ] Graphics are great. What it does lack in graphics, it makes up double so in detail and animations. Character creation is a very pleasant surprise, as it's very in depth in what kind of character you want and how they can look.\n\n[ + ] World Size is bigger than previous games, with there being hundreds of iconic and interesting locations to discover. While the map may seem to be smaller than Skyrim's, after you add all the underground and inside building parts, it's bigger than anything Bethesda has done yet. Best part? No two building / areas are the same.\n\n[ + ] Main Story is well written. It gets you interested right from the start, and while it kind of loses steam in the middle, it stays strong until the end. You'll see some twists a mile away, while others will surprise you. Side Quests are interesting and diverse like all Fallout games, if sometimes tedious.\n\n[ + ] Crafting also got a makeover. Every item you collect now has its own purpose, and can be used to craft weapon and armor mods. Building your own settlement is a new feature to Fallout that is both fun, and aggravating the more you tinker with it.\n\n[ + ] Sounds in this game are so good. The 10mm doesn’t sound like a stapler, and laser weapons sound wicked. Distant gunfire are so well done, you can tell which guns are being fired. Also more voice actors for the NPC's.\n\n[ +/- ] Dialogue now has the main character talking, which is something I wasn’t sure of working until I played the game. Turns out its good! But sometimes it hard to tell what your character will say based of the options it gives you , and the random / complex dialogue choices are now replaced by more straight forward ones.\n\n[ +/- ] Settlements are a new addition that allows you to build a variety of objects / furniture. It's a really neat feature at glance and you'll spend hours building and fixing stuff, but, it still needs work. Without going into detail, it can be aggravating placing a lot of objects due to either the junk on the ground you can't move / salvage, clipping into other objects, or NPC's getting in the way and going into places you built for your own self.\n\n[ +/- ] Bugs are almost expected in games like Fallout and Elder Scrolls. I haven’t ran across any that have crashed my game, and Bethesda is usually good on patching their games quickly, so we’ll see.\n\n[ - ] AI is about as smart as a box of rocks. It’s not something you really expect to be a main focus, but it should have been. Companions will get in your way which results in you dying or keep you from getting a kill.  They'll say the same mundane sentence over and over when you pick up an item. And disappear on you when you need them most.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall? Bethesda announced and released the game within 6 months, no release delays, no micro transactions, while also releasing two FREE game apps. In a world where we have companies like EA and Konami pulling every shady business tactic to make money, Bethesda and CD Projekt RED are here to set the standard on what a company should be.","November 16, 2015","true","210.8"," 275 of 447 people (62%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","62","275","447","10","9"

With that said, i have overall enjoyed my hours playing it, but there is way too many small things that breaks immersion, like clumbsy writing and unrealistic mechanics.","November 10, 2015","false","42.7"," 59 of 84 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","59","84","3","0"

Be it new mechanics like base-building that turned us off, or a wasteland however varied, too-similar to fallout 3 and New Vegas, or even the characters/factions with all their charms - falling just shy of memorable; there was just not a terribly compelling reason to come back to the wastes of Boston after an initial 15-20 hour romp.\n\nNow, I've never been to Boston, so I have no real connection to the area besides what I've read about.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFearlessChair/recommended/377160/","TheFearlessChair","TheFearlessChair","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheFearlessChair/","356 products in account","Disappointed People are giving this positive reviews because it's not broken like AC:Unity/Arkham Knight. Is this the standard we now accept? As long as the game can start and run at a decent FPS we're happy? Don't we care about the contents of the actual game? I genuinely wanted this game to be good. But it just isn't. I expected an open world RPG with all that entails, but I got an open world shooter with subpar shooter mechanics and crappy colliders. It seems like Bethesda lacked direction, focus and priorities. More on that as we go.\n\nFYI: I've only played on Survival difficulty (the hardest there is), and all of my gameplay related experiences is reflected in that.\n\nAI: The AI is really unintelligent and just flat out boring to fight. There is barely, if any, difference in how humans and dogs act in combat. Neither tries to alarm their pack/friends if attacked and both just charges dumbly towards you. Even if I put down all of their friends without a single scratch, they still don't care. Doesn't matter that they are hopelessly outmatched either. They're just sheep to the slaughter. And you might say: "Well, that's just like all of their other previous titles, isn't it?" And yes, pretty much. It seems like they haven't bothered developing new AI since they released TES IV: Oblivion. Which is just really sad.\n\nCollision: Really inconsistent colliders. Sometimes they are just fine, other times the devs just put an oversized box collider over a pipe. I can clearly see the entire head, and most of the body, of my target, but when I shoot at him the bullet hits the big invisible box around the pipe. However, these same colliders don't block vision for the AI or your characters movement (most of the time), just bullets. The game also includes lots of obstacles that are just 1-3 centimeters too low for your character to move below, even though there is clearly enough space if only your character had a shorter haircut. Other times there is definitely enough space, but instead you are simply blocked by invisible colliders in thin air due to a massive single box collider being placed over an 'X' of two crossing support beams. Crappy colliders combined with sacks of HP controlled by crappy AI makes combat a really dull and boring affair.\n\nUI Design: And the UI design is, to put it bluntly, a god damn awful mess. It looks like something that was made during their internal alpha and then subsequently forgotten about. I don't think there is a single good thing I can say regarding the UI. The game is riddled with both small and big UI nuisances, some of which are quite gamebreaking. Yes. The UI is gamebreaking! And it's not even a bug, it's a design choice! Here's the worst of them from the top of my head:\n\nThe UI is horrendous to navigate. It's like a minigame in and of itself. It requires two hands on the keyboard and one on the mouse to navigate it smoothly. The "favorites" menu is especially bad as it doesn't pause the game when in use. It is also clearly imported directly from the console version and is clearly not optimized for PC users. Just switching between my 4 most used weapons and a few throwables/consumables is a major hassle. And about 50% of the time my weapon disappears for several seconds after I switch using the favorites menu, often ending my character's life.\n\nWhenever you get on low health or get a crippled limb the game pauses and a pop up appears that tells you that you need to use a Stimpak. This often happens while someone is shooting at you. So now you have to go press "OK" in the middle of a firefight, and as the game resumes there is a very brief moment where the game doesn't properly record your inputs, which means you often die before you can do anything. This often happens even though you could easily have won if the popup hadn't been there. 95% of all my deaths are because of this. This forces me to constantly quicksave to avoid losing progress. Add this to the loading time and I probably spend more time in loading screens that actual combat.\n\nThe building UI (if you can even call that monstrosity a UI) is basically non-existent and extremely bad. It looks like a feature they just added in the very last moment because why not? Except, using this sytem is a big part of the game.\nBuild Mode: Building in build mode doesn't even feel like building. It's more like using a badly developed creative mode. You instantly remove/build everything. But you do this while struggling against the controls. It's like another minigame, and it's arguably worse than the UI. It feels like a bad mobile game ported to PC. At least it's not freemium, but that's is about the only upside that comes to mind. They make this awful system a part of the main story, but they don't bother to polish it and make it fun to use. This reflects very poorly on the main story. They shouldn't even have begun development on this feature until all other game essential features have been completed. It's called prioritizing, something they clearly haven't done at all.\n\nCharacters: The characters are uninteresting, one-sided, characterless robots. The most characteristic character I've met so far IS a robot; your butler before the apocalypse, Codsworth. And he's not even that interesting. Literally the most interesting thing about him is the fact that he can pronounce many, many different character names. But why did they even waste their time developing this feature when there were so many other features that clearly aren't done yet? Like for example their MAIN STORYLINE and the characters that is taking part in it? Lack of priorities.\n\nStory: So far the story pacing has been really bad. The story started out with a great premise, but then the story just went and died in a corner. Within the first hour of the game (still in prologue) something really important happens to your character ( Your son was kidnapped ). Since then all I've been doing is generic "Go to A, shoot/get stuff" for 10+ hours. It's as if it never happened, except for a few brief moments where you just casually comment on that really important thing - I've heard people speak about the weather with more affection. But I guess this is how it had to be due to how the dialogue options was designed:\n\nDialogue: The dialogue is some of the worst I've ever seen in a roleplaying game. I've seen dating sims with better written dialogue AND more dialogue options. Fallout 4 decided to go for the "always and only 4 generic dialogue options, all explained in only one word". Those words are usually always the same: Yes, No, Sarcasm, and a question about something (Info). You don't know what exactly you're going to say, and especially Sarcasm is bad here. You might insult them or just make a joke. Again: they bothered to develop a very crappy and non-essential feature like the building mechanic before polishing and quality testing their dialogue. Lack of priorities.\n\nConclusion: All in all I must say that Fallout 4 has been a massive disappointment. The fun only lasts while your still hyped and capable of ignoring all its flaws, which sadly won't be for long as they keep intruding on the rest of your gameplay. 4/10 for good graphics, just barely acceptable gameplay, and hype fuel.\n\nTL;DR: The game suffers from a complete lack of priorities during development which is clearly seen in pretty much every single part of the game. Controls and UI are clearly imported from consoles; the controls are somewhat acceptable in spite of this, but the UI is a complete and utter disaster that features gamebreaking design choices. Yes, design choices, not bugs, manages to break the game on higher difficulties. Story is just meh, and dialogue is just as bad or worse than the UI. If you're looking for a roleplaying game, then go somewhere else.","November 10, 2015","false","16.0"," 1,923 of 3,246 people (59%) found this review helpful 80 people found this review funny","59","923","3","80","125"

They make sick to my stomach. The practice of raising the season pass price because you realize you can get more money out of fanboys is disgusting.\n\nI don't think it's fair to compare this to the previous games in the series but this game is a steaming pile in comparison so I'mma do it anyway.\n\nY'know, I kinda dig the combat. It feels more powerful, fast-paced, and fluid. I think the world is cool, and I really like the ideas of synths. But for real, what the hell is up with the dialogue in this game? Four options that all lead to the same conclusion?????? Voice acting that is sometimes great and sometimes garbo?? Half the time I didn't even know what he'd end up saying when I picked an option and the other half it didn't matter because nothing had consequences!!!!!\n\nSeriously, whose idea was it to remove karma? You know, that thing that gives a bit of weight to your actions?? That actually makes things differ in playthroughs?? That gives you choice, variety, and able to actually make your character your own????? I don't want to play as some concerned dad. I am not a concerned dad, and I don't relate with a concerned dad. Lemme play some little nice guy baby butt who just does whatever. Let me be the edgy little caca of my dreams.\n\nOh wait, I can't even be edgy because there's barely any weapons / armour to choose from!!!! Did you know Fallout NV had like 5 different shotguns, not counting unique ones? This game has two. What kind of crap is that? If you give me the option to add an extended barrel to a machine gun, that shouldn't make it into the only sniper rifle that is even in the game. I'll give that a free pass on the pipe things because sure, that one should be customizable. BUT, I think those pipe guns are the dumbest thing ever. I hate that 90% of enemies are running around with these god awful variations of pipe abominations. It's kind of like the "legendary" weapons. A rolling pin that does more damage at night?!?!?! ♥♥♥♥ off. I don't appreciate this Borderlands approach to "tons of weapons."\n\nIt's also a nuisance that I can't always wear what I want because of the whole layering system. It's just feels like a cheap way of saying there's tons of options but really it's just different colours of the same pieces. And even then there's like five different varieties.\n\nThe lack of factions is also disappointing. In truth, I barely discovered them, anyway because I found the main story to be kind of a drag. You got the Brotherhood again, the robot guys, and the anti-robot guys? I don't really know. Where's some cool guilds and stuff that I can join? I feel like my only motivation to help people is to get info on my son who i  d o n ' t  e v e n  c a r e  a b o u t. You could offer me a cool gun and I'd be more inclined to lend assistance. But oh wait, it's just gonna be some special pipe pistol that does 5% extra damage to boy characters. ♥♥♥♥ off.\n\nI will add, base building is sort of cool. It's completely unnecessary to have in the game, but since it's also completely optional, it was kind of fun. There was some neat things you could do and it was a nice little distraction from the rest of the game.\n\nI didn't even finish the main quest. I could not be bothered to save my little champster from the kellog's cereal guy. I never felt like I could get engrossed in the world and scenarios like I could in Fallout 3 and New Vegas. I put a lot of time into those games (on 360) so I was genuinely very excited for this game. I barely looked at trailers or anything so it wasn't a matter of over-hyping myself and being disappointed. That kind of just happened on its own.","May 12","false","36.7"," 138 of 219 people (63%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","63","138","219","20","3"

But yeah 85% of the time was just mindless walking > finding a dungeon > killing raiders > looting > going back to the city to sell items.\nThis game is so shallow that it does not deserve more than 7/10. Bethesda went way too far with the "freedom , go anywhere do what you want". Also I won't mention "random skeletons in the funny position", because at least level design and landscapes in the games were pleasing to look at. Those guys behind it did a fantastic job.\n\nI wanted this game to be more refreshing and new, instead we get simplified Fallout 3 on the Skyrim engine 1.01. Fallout 4 feels like a huge framework for mods ,where Bethesda will use it to milk it to the end. Because they have the endless supply of the people whos "Fallout 3 " was the first fallout and they think Fallout 4 is the amazing piece of art. Its good game, it has some good moments but there aren't many of them sadly.\n\nNo idea how people can defend the dialogue wheel in this game, where every option leads to the same outcome. Why even bother recording 4 different lines if they result in the same outcome?\n\nAlso again empty wastelands with no human progress done all through 210 years? No estabilished cities? Wasteland is full of raiders? Who the hell breeds them? Its like there is somone who breeds them only to flood the wasteland to give the vault dwellers some loot and experience. Why no overgrown cities with the nature? Trees ,grass , vines? In Fallout 2 after merely 70 years after the bombs dropped you had already big estabilished cities and various cultures spread across the wasteland.\n\nI know that bethesda wants to keep to the '50 feels but it gets only weirder. Maybe its because every few years a Vault Dweller wakes up from his Vault and wrecks *poop* upon the wasteland, reducing all human progress again to 0. That makes a perfect sense isn't it?\n\nI gave it recommendation because it has modding support ( and fantastic written Nick Valentine which I hope he wil get his own story in the upcoming DLCs ), otherwise this game would be dead after few months and forever forgotten. But mods can't fix the core game problems, Fallout 4 is a huge step backwards and I really hope that the future expansions or next Fallouts will be improved not streamlined.","February 10","true","114.1"," 49 of 68 people (72%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","72","49","68","2","34"

Two of the three game endings can be completed within the same run through simply by reloading 10 minutes earlier.\n\nSo will you like it?

Instead we get a game with polished gameplay, average graphics with preety bad optimisation on launch, poorly made UI and repetitive side quests along a bad main story that ends preety much exactly the same no matter what you do (same exact cutscene).\n\nAll this would have been acceptable, had it not taken them 7 years to make it. It's not a bad game, but it's not a good game either. It's just "fine"...and "fine" is not gonna cut it after 7 years in development, this is just dissapointing. The skills are gone, the story is gone, the dialogue is gone...\n\nVerdict: 6/10 - Average shooter with some RPG elements\n\nIf you want a shooter with RPG elements, kinda like Borderlands, but with an average story and horrid dialogue, by all means, buy it on a sale.\n\nIf you want an RPG with shooter elements, with a very well made skill system, great story with amazing dialogue, with completely different endings based on your choices (that make a huge difference) and some great characters and locations, do yourself a favor and buy Fallout New Vegas, it's better in every single way imaginable.","February 3","false","118.2"," 60 of 87 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","60","87","2","2"

I guess we'll start with the fact that the rpg elements of decent dialogue and immersion are thrown out the window. Any attempts to develop a role or persona or any semblence of choice in this "rpg" are gone.\n\nThe dialogue options have been streamlined to the point that you essentially have no way of branching or expanding the story. The dialogue is laughably terrible compared to the previous 2 games of the series.\n\nAdditionally, the dialogue choices are vague, and offer the eloquent and lovely choices:\n\nYes\nNo\nSarcastic\n<insert vague question that is usually one word and is in no way helpful or what you meant to ask>\n\nThese choices are what you are dealt 90% of the time. I'm serious.\n\nThe voice actor rarely even says remotely what you choose. don't get me started on how lack luster he is as a character.\n\nThe Character Creation System is superb, though the whole point of a creation system is moot if everyones character talks, acts, and from a role playing stance is the same as everyone else.\n\nThe map size is fairly small compared to other AAA titles with open world exploration. The map can be traversed in 11 minutes.\n\n\nThe new power armor mechanic is interesting, but misguided. I enjoy the customization quite a bit. It truly is a fantastic start, but power armor is now functionally a vehicle you need to fuel constantly. Having to refuel and find fuel cells constantly is irritating at best and I feel makes power armor less enjoyable.\n\nThe construction system is laughable, many of the building items hover in the air above the ground as if they havent been tested on uneven terrain. The weapon creation system is interesting, but spams loot into your inventory that you cant consolidate.\n\nThe perk tree and special system is oversimplified. Perks in many branches are worthless. Skills like medicine, repair, and science are virtually non existent. forget about using well advanced skills to solve problems creatively.\n\nFor example: charisma is now the skill of "wave gun at x to pacify it" instead of being focused on persuasion. Because you know, waving a gun like a raving lunatic is super charismatic.\n\nIntelligence is used only for crafting, terminals and additional experience.\n\nIntelligence and charisma or any skill no longer offer unique dialogue choices. The traditional system has been replaced with a ♥♥♥♥ colour spectrum system hovering over one of the always 4 dialogue options.\n\nInterestingly enough, even perks like "Lady Killer" (there is no confirmed bachelor) have had their dialogue options removed. What's the fun in that? Nobody chooses perks like that for the damage, Bethesda. Just another shameful consequence of not allowing a vast dialogue for the player to explore.\n\nyou basically get your own faction after 2 quests. holy ♥♥♥♥ if only running a faction did anything.\n\nThe game's story is super bland. I wont spoil this early, but seriously, who didnt see that coming?\n\nEven Stevie Wonder saw that ♥♥♥♥ a mile away.\n\nThe combat is incredibly smooth, I'll give it that. The combat isn't typically what I personally care about in a RPG, but Fallout 4 does that well.\n\nIt's a shame that they are incorporating a lot of mechanics that the casual market is adopting. It isn't necesarily a bad thing, but it demonstrates the angle they are going for. Casual.\n\nIn terms of graphics, I'll make some concessions. I did not anticipate great visuals. I had hoped the usual stellar story and decision making atmosphere would carry the game.\n\nI was dissapointed.\n\nAs someone who has played every fallout game in the past, and loved the series I'm not quite sure this can be considered a proper Fallout title.\n\nTodd Howard lies again. Just like oblivion, just like fallout 3. We fell for it.\n\nUpdate: I wanted to speak about companions. It's great you can send them to different locations when dismissing, but I do miss being able to stop and ask them their life story. Interesting companions with their own stories to tell gave the previous games some depth that I'm currently missing. They do have personal missions, however any attempts to learn about them outside of these events is impossible thanks to a lack of dialogue.\n\nAdditionally, It seems companions have a peculiar system of dislikes and likes. Piper seems to get excited any time you loot something, and Strong gets angry at you everytime you step foot into power armor. Are we expected to avoid a staple of combat in his presence?\n\noh, and be mindful about their location. I sent dogmeat to sanctuary and he just randomly hides in one of the random doghouses. It's sometimes a pain to find his flea bitten ♥♥♥.\n\nThe absence of the Karma system has been sad as well, but at least we have the companions' relationship status. It isnt a system I'm happy with, but at least it's there.\n\nanother update: still no sign of any type of uses for medicine, repair, or a science skill to solve an issue. It looks like there isnt even a repair or science skill other than the perks for weapons crafting. I used to enjoy unique solutions to quests using these skills.\n\nexample of what is missing: In new vegas, you used to have options that would affect the narrative of a quest assuming you had a certain skill high enough. (repair 35 to fix "x" or medicine of 100 to identify this issue with this NPC)\n\nupdate: remembered that critical hits are no longer calculated based on random RNG and can instead be stored. I can't say I'm a fan of changing the luck mechanic.\n\nnote: to the people complaining on how many games are in this series. I am aware of the number of titles. The phrase " the previous 2 games of the series. " means that compared to the last two iterations of the series. It does not state there are only two previous games. I can't believe I have to clarify this. LeVar Burton is dissapointed.\n\nafter about 20hrs fallout is crashing on load of a save\n\nfinal update: All four of the endings are absurdly generic. The ending cutscene no longer details the ramifications of your choices, but instead ends similar to Mass Effect. The ending cutscene does not change and is static regardless.","November 10, 2015","false","182.2"," 1,733 of 2,938 people (59%) found this review helpful 67 people found this review funny","59","733","2","67","45"

Ill focus on why I cant really recommend it to any fan of those (or of the titles before that).\n\nBethesda had several years to work on this and...they apparently didnt do much, quiet to the contrary, and that infuriates me. And yes I know, the answer to most of the things here is "Mods". Ill get to that at the bottom of my review.\n\nWhat you get is basically a version of Fallout 3 that is dumped down in regards of choices, both story wise and dialogue wise.\nEDIT (7/JAN/16): I have to mention this to be fair: The game improved in three points, though none of them ranks highly on my list. You do get better graphics, MUCH better voiceovers and a larger Map with more Locations.\n\nSTORY & DIALOGUES\nFor the story: The only major game affecting choice is which factions you choose and which you destroy/betray. Even the "climatic" scene is always the same, no matter the faction, just with different actors stitched in. Also the general choices the stories offer seem much more limited, somehow I rarely felt that the choices available really made any difference. That feeling was different with previous titles.\n\nFor the dialogues: In previous installments of the series you could use your characters skills to make special dialogue options available. A Character that skilled toward Science could offer a scientific solution ot a problem, a strong character could intimidate others...that has been dumped down to the Charisma Stat and a few Charisma based perks.\nYou get 4 Dialogue options that often result to the same reactions from the NPCs. Atop of that whoever at Bethesda thought it wise to set the dialogue choices up in a way that you cant read from them what your character is going to say deserves to be fired...honestly...how can ANYONE even consider this a GOOD idea?\n\n\nCHARACTER BUILDING:\nThe Character Stats also haven been dumped down to Attribute Stats ranging from 1 to 10/11 and Perks. It allows for quiet a few builts but somehow it feels less flexible.\n\nCOMBAT: The first few hours in the game can be quiet tough but later on you RARELY get in over your head. The Power of the Character, even without a Power Armor, feels totally over the top. Supermutants? No threat at all (except for the occasional fat man launcher), Radscorpions? Easyly squished under your boots, even Deathclaws are dispatched easyly...almost no matter how you skill your character as most of the Perks ARE combat oriented and bolster your abilities.\nThe game also feels like it tries to be a FPS but does so badly, there are lots of invisible walls (or rather "rims" around objects that block shots, so an opponent standing behind a tree (with parts of him peeking out) or behind a railing sometimes cant be hit except via the V.A.T.S. System.\n\nINVENTORY:\nTHEY DIDNT CHANGE IT! They had years to fix it, about everybody complained about it but they just didnt change it.\nEven worse: as you need to pick up more items for resource and mod part harvesting it gets even more cluttered. It is a TOTAL mess.\n\nNEW THINGS:\nThe two "new" things to the game are the settlement contruction/management and the way they handle weapon and armor modifications.\nSettlement Construction:\nIs a MESS and HAPAZARD at best. You get verly little in the way of items you can build and placing them can be a real pain, since they tend to snap to other items over quiet a bit of range or you cant place them because other non removeable items are in the way...or because of even minor overlapping which makes combining certain wall pieces with other walls, floors or roofs impossible. What I mean by Hapazard: you can clear out quiet a bit of trash from the settlement areas to build things...but some items, that you should be able to remove, because the EXACTLY IDENTICAL ITEMS THAT CAN BE REMOVED ELSEWHERE, just CANT be removed in other spots (like some car wrecks for example) forcing you to painfully built around them.\n\nThe Settlement Management (Food, Water, Defences) is totally unbalanced and also pointless, once you get a certain kind of farmable fruit you only need that single one, because it produces more that all the other food types with no drawbacks.\nDefences: Since your settlers cant die there really isnt much point in equipping them or setting up something like defensive walls and stuff. The only harm attackers can do is twofold: they can destroy items of the settlement (but seriously, protecting those by walls is more of a hassle than replacing them) and steal items from the central item pool (doesnt really matter if you store them in other containers). The settlers themself will always get up again, zombie like, and continue the fight, slowly eroding enemy forces.\n\nWeapon & Armor Modification\nWhat looked quiet good when I watched it at a friend playing it turned out to be basically just leveling up weapons so they are of use to you later on. Most of the upgrades are linear, one more powerfull than the previous one. There is a SLIGHT kind of calibration for special tasks possible, but I wouldnt say its enough to make the system praiseworthy.\n\nSUMMARY:\nI am disapointed by the game overall and really angry about some of the overall design and gameplay choices made by Bethesda. It feels causal and not to mention lazy and shows no real "step ahead" rather it feels like it degenerated compared to the previous titles. For me it does feel nowhere like a AAA Title, there are many indie games that might not be optically as good but offer  TONS more depth. Compared by what a company like CD Project brought to the market with the Witcher Games this game is nowhere near deserving of a place among the Top 5 Games of the Year.\n\nLASTLY:\nBUT MODS!?  Yeah of course, there are many many mods around already, quiet good ones, with which you can change the game to your likeing and I really love that BUT...if I wanted a toolbox to create my own experience I would have gotten one and not something marketed as a GAME. Or I could have stuck to Fallout 3/Vegas and Skyrim. This game feels like the answer to something nobody asked for.","January 1","false","164.6"," 217 of 355 people (61%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","61","217","355","7","17"

I've been a fan of Fallout since I was in diapers, and have many memories playing the first and second games multiple times. Fallout 3 was many things to me. It  was foreign at first, but I eventually grew to like it's gameplay mechanics and wolrd space. The FPS perspective is what really intrigued me. Being able to actually see the environment in 3D was something I always wanted in a Fallout game (I don't count F:BoS. That was a slap accross the face to any who had played that horrid game). Fans who've never played the older games, but've played Fallout 3, have only seen a sliver of what Fallout really is. I've seen mixed thoughts and feelings from old fans. Some loved 3, some despise it. With a new and old fan base, there's a lot of back and forth between these two on their understandings of Fallout. Read any comment section regarding Fallout, and you'll find these conversations every now and then. I personally, don't have much of a problem with Fallout 3, but I do favor Fallout: New Vegas, which I'll explain in the next paragraph.\n\nOnce Fallout 3 had two years to sink in, we were then given Fallout: New Vegas in 2010. Obsidian Entertainment was the company that developed New Vegas, which a lot of newer fans may be unaware that most of the team at Obsidian Entertainment, worked on the previous Fallout titles. Fallout: New Vegas generated a lot of positive feedback from old fans, reviving a lot of lore that was present in the older games and what was to be in Van Buren (Cancelled F3). Newer fans simply saw it as a new Fallout game, but may've had trouble understanding the older lore, due to only playing Fallout 3.\n\nI know what you're thinking. "You're reviewing 3/NV, not 4." I needed to push this background information to give you an understanding of why a die-hard fan is rejecting this game.\n\nNow let's begin...\n\nI'm going to start with the positives of this game.\n\n+ Fallout 4's visual presentation is extremely beautiful in comaprison to the previous 3D worlds seen in Fallout 3 & New Vegas. While the brighter and vivid color pallette wasn't my favorite, it definitely makes the scenery more  interesting to look at. Volumetric lighting and ambient occlusion also adds more realism to the game. The character lighting is a bit immersion breaking, but with a small change to the ini. file, it's not biggy.\n\n+ Gunplay is much more tolerable than it was in the last two. No more needing to stick your neck out, due to some pesky collision mesh getting in your way. I love how there is finally a grenade key, so you don't have to keep going back and forth between switching from your weapon to grenades and vice versa.\n\n+ Weapon & armor customization adds more personality to your play style. Weapon mods were present in Fallout: New Vegas, but in addition from purchasing from vendors, you can now craft mods with raw materials. If you can't buy your mods, this is a good alternative. Armor has also received a massive overhaul. Rather than having just headgear and general body armor, there are now armor layers you can apply to your character (arm guards, shoulder plates, chest guards, etc.) Similar to weapon mods, armor can be modified too.\n\n+ Power armor feels right in this game. It's what it always should've felt like: a walking tank. It's fully customizable as well, and you can even add paint jobs. However, I'm in  HUGE disagreement with the fusion core system. I know it had to be used to keep power balance in the game, but there is lore that contradicts it. Aside from the fusion core fiasco, power armor looks and feels great.\n\nNow for the cons...\n\n- There is an extreme lack of dialogue option in this installment. The voiced protagonist was not only a worry of mine, but to others as well, simply because of the restraint it would put on player immersion and choice. Everyone's nightmare came true unfortunately. The choices on the wheel don't exactly tell you what you'r'e saying either, so if you choose an option, you may not be on board with what you just said after you chose it. New Vegas and even 3 had more dialouge option and choice than you did in this game. Options are very black and white and there's no way of meeting common ground with others. A great example would be my initial intentions with the Brotherhood of Steel. They don't like synths, but where I thought Fallout 4 would have the capacity to maybe have me persuade the BoS into thinking differently about them, that option is no where to be found. If done correctly, Fallout New Vegas allowed me to have the Brotherhood of Steel and NCR to work together, despite their rough history together. Why is it that I can do something like that in one game, but not in a new one? It's things like that really make playing the game a bit tough, because there is little freedom to seek a better alternative.\n\n- There are barely any quests in this game. I was amazed to see how Skyrim was able to have so many quests for you to do, yet Fallout 4 didn't. Sure, there are the redundant quests that happen endlessly when you talk to Preston Garvey, but who honestly gets a thrill out of saving the same settlement from the same band of radiers repeatedly? I was expecting an overwhelmingly amount of things to do in this game, but I was sadly mistaken.\n\n- The stories are seriously lacking in a lot of Bethesda RPGs. Fallout 3 and Skyrim's storylines were definitely underwhelming, but in comparision to Fallout 4, they seem like they could win awards. First off, the story is merely an inverse of Fallout 3. Rather than child looking for dad, it's the other way around. You (Dad/Mom) are looking for your child. To spare spoilers, I'll just say this: It's very predictable, and once you "finish" it, you don't feel like it's gotten you anywhere. In New Vegas, and a little bit in 3, you were give results of the actions you committed in the wasteland. It gave you a real sense of consequence and what was done because of you, the wasteland will either change for better or worse. In Fallout 4, none of that is present.\n\n- You don't get to develop your player background, it's decided for you. You're forced to be a parent with a given background. Fallout 3 forced you to be a young adult, but still left room to determine your uprising in the wastes. Fallout: New Vegas only titled you as a Courier, nothing else, and from there you could decide what kind of person you were. This also holds back player creativity, and takes away the purpose of an RPG. If I can't choose what I want to be, what's the point in creating a character anymore?\n\n- Settlement building is pretty much NOT optional and is a cover up for the lack of quests. Reason being is that where you are not given enough quests, you resort to the settlement building. When this was shown, I knew we'd lose interesting towns and cities that could've been presented. Now, it's up to us to make our settlements "unique." Even with mods, it's hard to make folks in your settlements feel more like a person and less of a zombie, mindlessly hitting a hammer against a wall. You can't even make small talk with them! You can decorate your settlement as fancy as you want, but what relevance is it generating in the game? Yeah, you're being creative, but for what? It's busy work to keep you from being conscious of the lack of quests in this game.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nI really wanted to like this game, but Bethesda worked against it's formula this time around. Fallout: New Vegas was their opportunity to study what fans were wanting more out of the franchise. However, they decided to turn Fallout 4 into an action game, not an RPG. What wasted potential... I certainly hope Obsidian gets a turn again with the Fallout franchise. Perhaps, they can fix what's been damaged...","March 16","false","445.4"," 49 of 69 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","49","69","3","15"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Johnstamoslives/recommended/377160/","Johnstamoslives","JohnStamosLives","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Johnstamoslives/","267 products in account","I've seen some overwhelmingly critical reviews of Fallout 4 and wanted to step into here to throw my hat into the lot: the overwhelmingly negative reviews are misguided and misplaced. This is especially true on Metacritic where it seems a battalion of armed and dangerous gamers who were ready to review the game to hell and beyond on review day.\n\nTo me, it's clear many haven't played FO beyond FO3. That's a core issue in how people respond to FO 4.\n\nLet's start with the first and most important aspect of a game: Fallout 4 is fun. Let me add to that: Fallout 4 is beautiful and Fallout 4 is interesting.\n\nThat's not to say that Fallout 4 doesn't have its areas that need improvements. I have a list of areas that need definite improvement and I've tried to mix these with those overwhelmingly negative comments so that you can see where people step out of "rational criticism" and into "raging, mouth-frothing gamer."\n\n"The Conversation Wheel"\nThe conversation wheel is a downgrade from previous Fallouts.  This is the biggest and most negative change away from previous Fallouts.  It's a change that glorifies a game that I can't stand - Mass Effect - and stands in the face of the role playing genre.  In THAT sense; I agree in how frustrating it is to have a significant lack of choices and responses.\n\nExamples, here, include choosing "sarcasm" which almost always appears on the radial menu.  Human speech and conversation is more caveated than just a single word and displaying "sarcasm" as an option omits the fact that sarcasm, itself, takes on varying forms in human communication.  When I'm sarcastic to my boss it's significantly different than if I'm sarcastic to my loved ones or friends - that's because sarcasm is nuanced, just as human speech is, and Fallout 4 is definitely missing out here.\n\nI feel like Bethesda could take a chapter from Fallout's past - Fallout was originally an isometric RPG similar to Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale or, even more closely feeling, Arcanum. A more recent example would be Pillars or Eternity which has a near novelization of story and writing - and this is something DIRECTLY in Fallout's own history and past.\n\nIt's a fair critique to want to return to that.\n\nThis game isn't an RPG anymore\nThis is the extreme statement from someone upset about the above conversation wheel and they are, to be completely honest, wrong.  Fallout 4 is as much of an RPG as any other game labeled as such - Final Fantasy 7, Valkyria Chronicals or Skyrim.  You might not have as much  choice  in Fallout 4, but, it is absolutely a role playing game in which you play the role of a father or a mother looking for their lost child.\n\nThere are many who feel shoehorned into who their character is and yet I'm sure those same individuals aren't upset that they were shoehorned into the role of the Neravar in Morrowind.  Games have been giving a jolt to their story and characters from the get go - with many, but not all, characters having a past BEFORE their introduction as a character. Fallout 4's system, here, reminds me very much of Deus Ex: Human Revolution in that capacity - the character existed before the events of the story and has plot points based on those events.\n\nThis isn't something new and it certainly isn't even new to Fallout: your character in Fallout 1, while unnamed, still had his own "back story" of sorts. It's not new to RPGs, either.  Alex from Lunar, Chrono from Chrono Trigger, JC Denton... the list goes on - many variants of the RPG genre exist and many of them have characters that have a limited scope or previous history.  This isn't new.  It's not a big deal.\n\nThe conversation wheel is.\n\nCombat in the Wastes\nThe combat systems of Bethesda games has always been frustrating for me. I was originally going into melee stealth but quickly found this to be an exercise in frustration.  I'm still happy I dumped points into strength, but, I'm frustrated with the lack of stealthing innovation and game play.  Deus Ex: Human Revolution did this much better.  Melee stealth in Fallout 4 is clunky and awkward for me.  It seems thrown together in the last minute.  Many times, I will successfully stealth and kill one person only to alert everyone in the area that I'm around.  Apparently, despite instantly dying, people are able to give off enough of a death scream to make everyone else aware of what's going on.\n\nIt would be nice if I had to drag bodies or more game play around the stealth elements.  Thus far, 20-25 hours in, I haven't found any gear worthy of wearing for stealthing.  The game says that light and heavier gear makes you seen faster - but I often get seen in just long johns in the complete dead of night.\n\nThey also fill areas with lights making stealth an exceptionally difficult choice and option.  Suppressors are gated behind crafting skill gates or higher levels, so I haven't obtained anything to shoot lights out. It makes the early game for a stealther frustrating.\n\nGuns "feel" very wastelander-ish, which is cool. They've done a much better job of weapons being pieced together from scrap and garbage. It "feels" like I'm in a post-apocalyptic world.\n\nMelee combat out of stealth is pretty bad. I spent one fight stunned by rad roaches early in.  I realized my dreams of being purely melee were misplaced.\n\nI don't have much to say about VATS. I don't use it much because it doesn't offer much of a reprieve for me at the current moment outside of melee kills - you can thwak the heck out of someone in a VATS melee session.\n\nQuesting and Gameplay\nI think the questing and game play aspects of Fallout 4 are fun. I'm having a lot of fun doing the varying quests around the Wasteland. I like fighting and finding legendary creatures which drop better items, I like modifying my weapons and armor types, and I like the feel of downtown Boston.\n\nThere are some who are bothered by the Minutemen quest series - it doesn't bother me at all. In the long scheme of things, the Minutemen are a small-time militia attempting to secure a single town. It doesn't surprise me or seem weird that the only real remaining member of the militia-group wants you to take charge. A bit early? Possibly. Although I did massacre several groups of bandits beforehand.  So why not?\n\nOther than that, I like the Boston feel to the take.  One NPC called me a "re-todd."  10/10.  Would bash skull in again.\n\nCrafting / Towns\nI really, really like this addition to Fallout but I'm frustrated it wasn't taken to the hole by Bethesda.  I cannot wait for the mods to be released for this section.\n\nBonuses:\n\nIt's awesome that I can level by the crafting alone. I spent a good hour on building my own workshop complete with setting up areas for my settlers to sell weapons and armor and other goods.  It's this cool little "hub" in the sky for people to come trade. I like that a lot.\n\nI think the town setting / system allows for a unique perspective in setting up a thriving area for Boston - being a force for positive change for the settlers of the world. There's a brotherhood of steel member who mentions that people aren't aware of what the world is doing for the "species." The town system answers that - it's humans trying to make a living and working together to survive.\n\nNegatives:\n\nHere are some crafting needs:\n- Needs a flip orientation option\n- Needs to be able to turn on other axes besides left and right.\n- Let me increase the proportion or decrease it. See Wildstar's building options, here. If I want a giant wrench - LET ME.\n- Let me place items where I want. Limiting me to the ground sucks.\n- Let me salvage EVERYTHING. GIve me tools or robots that I can use to salvage entire facilities so I don't have to drag everything around.\n\nFallout 4 is fun but has areas to improve on. What game doesn't?","November 12, 2015","true","112.4"," 411 of 687 people (60%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","60","411","687","24","5"

No idea about time spent in the rest of the series, a lot.\n\nIn many ways, Fallout 4 is a much weaker RPG. They removed skills, changed SPECIAL in some both good and bad ways, turned Perks into a skill tree, simplified and worsened dialogue and the ability to roleplay a class.  You can't be 'evil' like you could in FO3 or NV.\n\nWith that negative paragraph out of the way there is SO much to like about FO4. It's FUN, it's huge, it's a good shooter, it's pretty. The world is gorgeous, think Skyrim plus a bit. The main world is continuous, no loading or zoning. You still zone into buildings (SSD recommended). Downtown Boston is a treat. The skyscrapers occupied by bandits or mutants are amazing. There's always a backstory, often played out in holotapes or text in terminals. I've been playing for over 400 hours and still see new things every time I play. Friends have found things that I haven't and vice versa.\n\nSettlement building isn't very intuitive, but when you learn the systems is a lot of fun and rewarding. Crafting is another area that has been taken to the next level. New Vegas kicked it up a notch from FO3, mods took that to another level. Fallout 4's crafting is amazing, interesting, and adds depth to the game.\n\nThere are always 6 things to do and the best adventures are those you get into while heading to a quest target. The world is richly populated. Even regular bandits are interesting with good dialogue. Even their banter that you can only hear if you're in stealth is great.  I never get tired of the random adventures.\n\nThe main storyline is sold and has more than a couple surprises. It's high quality for a Bethesda game. The factions are interesting with many interesting characters in each of them. The number of quests in the game is staggering.\n\nI highly recommend Fallout 4 to any fan of the genre. It's a lesser rpg, but it's a great game. I love it!","January 8","true","817.5"," 128 of 204 people (63%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","63","128","204","8","0"

Knowing that I would get equal amounts of criticism, I made this review positive. Let me start off by first stating my opinions for the previous games. I've never been a fan of the Fallout franchise. None of the games interested me that much. I was more into Elder Scrolls than anything else that Bethesda made. After many people asking me to purchase this game, I eventually did, and this one standed out to me. It gave me a lot more of an interesting beginning with a unique look compared to the other games. Some might say this isn't an RPG, which to be fair, they're right, but that doesn't bother me. The action in this game is solid. Not perfect, thanks to bugs, but good enough. In conclusion, the only reason I liked this game was because it wasn't a Fallout game, which might seem strange to some people, but thats the reason. A fan of the franchise would probably be disappointed here.\n\nNOTE:\nAll of my reviews are laid out in a particular format that fits the game.\n\nAbout\nLike the other games, Fallout 4 is an Immersive Open World Action game which some people also clasify as an RPG, others don't. The game is set in the year 2287 after a nuclear war that turned planet Earth into a nuclear wasteland. You are a survivor, who was frozen in ice inside a vault underground for over 200 years. You leave the vault into a place known as the Commonwealth. A place filled with raiders, mutants and other creatures. There is still some human civilization, scattered across the Commonwealth, some of which are mutated beings. The game is a lot familiar with the other Fallout games. For example, your inventory is located on a garment called a Pip-Boy. There are 4 different joinable factions in this game: The Minutement, The Brotherhood of Steel, The Railroad and finally the Institute, all of which have different effects on the Commonwealth.\n\nStory\nI for one, enjoyed the story of this game, up to a certain point. The opening scene gave me quite a suprise, as I was expecting to be bored to death with this game. The amount of tension it gives, is quite chilling. First going into the Commonwealth after 200 years is also a very memorable moment. The game starts off just moments before the nuclear crisis happens. You, your wife/husband and your infant son are about to go out to the park when a Vault-Tec representative knocks on your door, announcing that you and your family have access to the local Vault, if a nuclear crisis were to occur. Funnily enough, not long after, a news journalist announces that their have been nuclear bombings in New York, and Pennsylvania. Your local area then starts to evacuate, and you make your way into the vault. You then move into a stasis pod where you are frozen. You later wake up to see some intruders examining your wife/husband's pod. They open it to take your son, and due to your wife/husband's retalliation, she/he gets shot. You are then forced asleep again. Later waking up, the game tells you to find your kidnapped son, and get revenge on the people that murdered your wife.\nI enjoyed the story up to a certain point, until I had no idea what I was meant to do. The game gave me no indication on what to do next. It was only in my 2nd playthrough did I understand. Also, the ending I got was rather slow and poor. There are multiple endings to this game, but most are pretty similar to each other.\n\nGameplay\nThe game is generally classified as an Action RPG, but really it focuses more on the action. Fallout 4's gameplay is very similar to the previous games. You're in an open wasteland thats fully explorable. You can switch between first person and third person view. There are some new features though. One thats very notable is the base building feature. Throughout the Commonwealth, you will find areas called settlements. You can help improve these settlements by expanding them, building defenses and even planting crops. You even have your own area to build your own base. There are already many fights going on in the Commonwealth where you can join in and go guns blazing. The game features a new type of skill tree with abilities that can be upgraded. Due to the game's infinite levelling system, you're sure to be able to use every point. Weapons are fully customisable allowing you to upgrade them. The crafting system is rather in-depth in this game. You are able to scavenge parts to help build things for your settlements.\nThen next part is rather controversial. Is Fallout 4 an RPG? Well the answer is yes and no. The dialogue system is very different than the previous games. Taking a similar approach to Mass Effect, dialogue options are now set to options like: Yes, No, Sarcastic. Most of the time, all the dialogue points into one direction, making your choices irrelevant. There are times though where saying different things does have different effects, such as persuasive options, but is still rather beat down RPG.\n\nDesign & Graphics\nI can start off by saying that the wasteland has quite a lot of detail. Not to mention how big it is. Even I still haven't fully explored it. There are plenty of interesting locations to go to, some with their own stories. The environments are desolate, the buildings are old and decrepit, the cities are filled with mysteries. Definitely buy this game if you want an interesting exploration game. Some areas look a bit painted or smudged, including characters like Dogmeat that literally looks like he\'s been painted, other than that it's fantastic.\nAs for graphics, thats a mixed point of view. If you can actually run the game with good settings, thats great. If you can't, then expect plenty of framerate issues. I can run this game on high, but I never get 60FPS. The game is way too unoptimised for a lot of PCs.\n\nUI [User Interface]\nPeople who've played other Fallout games, this will be a piece of cake to you, almost nothing has changed. The hud is pretty much easy for anyone to understand. Inventory managment wasn't much of a bother to me really as well. The workshop though, I had a couple of problems with. Some constructables I found quite difficult to find, especially mission items. The game doesn't make it obvious on where to find them. Other than that, more or less simple.\n\nPros - Excellent gameplay\n- Immersive world\n- Loads of detail\n- Interesting companions\n- Huge world\n- In-depth crafting system\n\nCons - Weak RPG\n- Bad Fallout game\n- Bugs\n- Weak ending\n- Awful dialogue system\n\nFinal Recommendation\nThis is a hard one to judge, and I'm probably going to get hated for it, but I\'m rating it positive. If there was a mixed option I would've chose that. An excellent action open world experience ruined by poor RPG elements and the abundance of bugs. Good game, bad Fallout game. Best buy when on sale.\n\nFinal Verdict - 6.3/10.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/377160/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE2BkLqMef4\n\nIf you liked this review, be sure to give it a like!

Bethesda previously developed the mediocore Fallout 3, which was salvaged by Obsidian's amazing Fallout New Vegas, which brought the series back to its deep RPG mechanics that defined the series.  For the newest addition of the series, Bethesda has gone in the complete opposite direction. Fallout 4 isn't an RPG in any sense of the term, it's an open-world action game. Gone are skills, player agency, deep quests, and a story that is truly changed through player actions, Fallout 4 settles for very simplistic quests (go here and kill these people/collect this object), the possibility to make your character perfect by leveling up every SPECIAL stat, simplistic combat with cues from recent first person shooters, limited dialogue choices (every dikalogue option can be summed up as "yes", "yes sarcastic", "no, but really yes because the game can't progress if I say no" and "ask for more caps". Your skills or SPECIAL stats no longer change, alter, or add dialogue options. The game also includes many lore-breaking elements. Jet now existed pre-war, even though it was established in Fallout 2 that it was a post-war invention. Vertibirds aren't an Enclave invention anymore as they are shown in the opening pre-war segment. No longer is T-51 the most advanced pre-war power armor and the Brotherhood of Steel's iconic armor, Bethesda decided to throw in new T-60 armor, which was apparently put into service days before the war, just you know, because. Not only does Fallout 4 fail as an RPG, it fails as a Fallout game, do yourself a favor and buy the classic games or New Vegas. If you want something more recent, I dunno, buy Wasteland 2 and pretend it's a Fallout game.","April 8","false","44.9"," 112 of 177 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","112","177","5","21"

Bethesda never changes.\n\nInstead of improving on New Vegas, everything what was done in that game was ignored.\nIt is not even a Role playing game anymore - it is a shooter with RPG elements.\n\nSkills are gone, reputation is gone, dialogs with more than 4 options are gone, skill checks in dialogs are gone with the skills. Just go kill more raiders, ghouls, rad roaches. Repeat.\n\nI am 6 hours into the game, and it is already obvious that plot and quests are secondary feature here. You can hardly tell characters apart, and your motivation to do any quest what so ever is lacking.  The world feels dead and Fallout 3 all over again. There is no logic to it.\n\nSame scrap shanty towns two hundred years after war. And everyone have ammo and food didn't spoil yet.\nDon't forget the Super Mutants that are also here for no reason, same as they were in Fallout 3.\n\nIf you don't mind post apocalyptic Far Cry/Skyrim fusion - this is a game for you.\nBut it is not Fallout. Not for a second.\n\nUPDATE: After putting more hours into the game and finishing the main storyline I can say few more things.\nFor starters, reputation is actually there for major factions, and probably major setlements.\nIt got better for me after 40 something hours, when you start getting more freedom, but one thing still troubled me no matter what and I think it is very important.\nThe game almost lacked roleplaying expirience for me. Dialog options provide very limited options and dialog scripts in many quests bar you from absolutely legitimate options you would consider.\nNot to spoil anything, don't think you can lie and play double agent. You probably will be forced to say things you don't really want to.\nYou have to invent your own motivations and give your own logic to things. There is no major reason to enter two of the playable factions, at least I didn't find them.\nIn the second half more logic appear in your secondary quests, but your character is still bland.\nHis intelligence does not matter, his past military expirience does not matter(or her law degree I am sure). You are mostly agreeing, disagreeing or telling dumb jokes. You have no real personality and you have little(it is checked once or twice) pre-war knowledge.\nMost companions I came across appreciate very similar style of play(help everyone, be a good guy)\nDifficulty is also  a problem. I played on Survivor and came across only one fight I was forced to retreat from. Everything else was a breathe. No hunger/thist etc. Addictions are cured with a magic inhaler.\nMoney are not needed throgh most of the game, you find so much stuff you can outfit an army.\nUpgrading stuff on the other hand, takes a lot of scavenging and I liked that.\n\nAll in all. It is not a bad game. It has a lot of features, it is gigantic and it is action packed.\nIt doesn't provide a good Roleplaying expirience, it lacks any deep moral or any other conflicts and the plot is preety much what you would expect.\n\nP.S. For people in the comments. Guys who write spoilers in the comment section, rot in hell. Even if you didn't like the game, it is not the way to do it.\nAnd christ on a bike, I never implyied New Vegas was made by Bethesda. I lamented the fact they learned nothing from how Obsidian done it. And Obsidian does it better.","November 10, 2015","false","75.7"," 3,113 of 5,310 people (59%) found this review helpful 223 people found this review funny","59","113","5","223","153"

However, if you are expecting this game to follow along and be the cotinuation of the fallout we've all come to know and love, you'll be disappointed. By far, the most disappointing part for me is the dialogue. Oh how I HATE the dialogue. Now that all of the lines are voice acted, the speech options have been very limited. You can four choices. Once you make a choice, you cannot go back and explore where the other three choices would have let you. Once you make your choice, you're stuck with it. In addition, whenever you complete a quest, ESPECIALLY a quest that's meant to develop the characters and make you invested in them, you can no longer even talk to the characters you did the quest for. Instead of bringing up the dialogue options like in the previous fallouts, now the only thing you can do for a majority of npcs is access their inventory. This "feature" alone has killed hope I had that this game could be the successor to fallouts three and new Vegas. The building is very unrefined and not very well explained, everything feels very overpowered (humanoid enemies (raiders) die in like two - three shots with a 10mm ( that might just be my difficulty settings)), the leveling system is now based off of your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. stats, so before you can unlock the various "perks" that are offered, you have to spend hours grinding out the exp necessary to reach the level and S.P.E.C.I.A.L. requirements. That said, I do really like some of the mechanics that have been implemented. I like the ability to be able to customize armor and weapons. I like being able to build a settlement. However, I also feel like the settlements were a HUGE letdown. So far, in all my playtime, my settlement has not been raided once, and you can pretty much just put it on auto pilot after placing some beds, food, and water. The building is so clunky- sometimes walls will snap together, other times they won't, the pre-made houses have holes and gaps in them, the list goes on and on. Despite the things that I do like in this game, it just feels like there's no real depth. I don't feel attached to any of the characters, or even my character. For all of the above reasons, there's just no way I would be able to enthusiastically recommend this game to anyone who's a fan of the previous fallouts- it's just too much of a drastic change and it feels like a lot of impostant features to fallout are missing.","January 1","false","51.1"," 33 of 42 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","33","42","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/everydayimtutturuu/recommended/377160/","everydayimtutturuu","Miqs","http://steamcommunity.com/id/everydayimtutturuu/","255 products in account","It is a shame that Fallout 4 turned from RPG with FPS elements (3 and New Vegas) into FPS with light RPG elements.\n\ntl:dr version:\nGood game, bad RPG. Bethesda's writing is inferior to Obsidian's.\n\nAs this is a PC game it means I'll have to nitpick about the port. At this point it's clear that Bethesda doesn't care about PC side. The game is designed to run at 60 fps and is locked to it via v-sync and we know what that does to mouse controls. Things like FoV, V-sync and depth of field are buried in multiple .ini files and you have to set them to read only or the game reverts them back to default values. As V-sync is enabled by default the game has terrible mouse acceleration problems and disabling V-sync also introduced screen tearing, forcing me to use third party software to lock my FPS. Screen tearing was solved by locking the frame rate bit higher than 60. The performance isn't anything spectacular either with frame drops when entering anywhere with more than few buildings. I was forced to drop it down to medium settings to avoid biggest drops which is something I shouldn't have to do with my hardware. (i5-3570k, 16GB RAM, GTX 980 and installed on WD Black 7200rpm HDD) The loading times were dreadfully long at times. At the worst I could've gone and made a cup of tea and it would still be loading. Fortunately I've experienced only few crashes. There's been few bugs such as entering power armor or terminal and character gets stuck forcing you to reload your previous save. I encountered one game breaking bug that made me restart the game but luckily it happened only few hours into the game. The bug gave me constant radiation damage no matter where I was.\n\nThere's not much story to speak of. Your characters are locked with specific background stories and they're fully voice acted which I feel detracts from the RPG element. At the start of the game you're hurried up into a vault, see the bomb go boom and then you're turned into a meat popsicle. Later you wake up, your significant other is killed, your baby kidnapped and then it's for a rescue. Not much really happens between leaving the vault and finding your son, you're mostly doing fetch quests for others until you get to him. Biggest things that happen are when you finally decide to join up with a faction.\n\n\nI said that this is more like FPS than RPG so what do I mean with it? No karma, skills have been removed, only perks remain and traits do not exist anymore. I get what they were going for with removing the skills. They wanted to avoid the waste of levels between skill checks (76-99 in lockpicking were totally wasted) but then they gated them behind level checks so it doesn't really change it. No level cap throws any consideration for builds out of the window as every character will end up being the same at some point, you can even use your level up points for your SPECIAL stats which makes builds even more redundant because you don't have to make any sacrifices. Conversations consist of yes, no, question and sarcastic responses and what you are going to say are shown to you really vaguely instead of full responses. Speech checks are dice rolls, meaning you can just save scum until you pass it. Intelligence 1 characters are treated the same as int 10 so no more silly dialogue.\n\nCompanions are more like walking witty comment machines than people following you. You can't initiate conversations with them and they don't have their own agendas. As an example: Boone from New Vegas will warn you that he will engage any Legion members on sight no matter what and oh boy will he do it, I just helped him by giving him antimateria rifle. In F4llout the Brotherhood of Steel wants to exterminate everything that isn't human but don't do ♥♥♥♥ about it when you bring a synth, super mutant or a ghoul into their place, nor will your companions care where you bring them. The worst you'll get is a mean comment from someone. You're better off without any of them, they can't shoot straight and get in your way all the time.\n\nThe well hyped customization also falls flat on its face. The base weapon variety is lacking so you don't have much of a choice in what you're going to use. And no, modding 10mm pistol to fire full auto doesn't make it an SMG or putting different colored grip doesn't turn it into different weapon. The hardest thing about modifying your gear is finding the materials to do it, not deciding what you want to put on as +damage is the only way to go.\n\nThe settlement building was a good idea but as usual Bethesda leaves it half way done and expects modders to make it better. Why can't I decide where I can build my settlement? I'm restricted to wherever they've put the workbenches and work with it. You can't change the terrain or sink objects into it so your protective walls will be floating in the air and being ugly. Halo 3 back in 2007 got this right. The variety of items you can place is limited and by limited I mean you can't build half the items you see in the world. Then you have the settlers who occupy your settlements. You can assign them to do different tasks but you don't see who is doing what and some don't do whatever free jobs are around without you telling them and even doing so they can ignore it. Then they have the nerve to tell you "thanks to our work this is starting to look like home and you're welcome here too" ♥♥♥♥♥, I build this for you and now you act like you own the place.\n\n\nNext part gets into spoiler territory about factions so feel free to skip it.\n\nThere are four factions you can join which are the Minutemen, Brotherhood of Steel, Railroad and the Institute.\n\nI don't really know what the Minutemen want to do other than trying to help people against the dangers of wasteland. After finding out that a big group of them turned into bandits after the group started fighting each other I didn't want to help these people into position of power.\n\nRailroad wants to free synths from Institute's control but they lack any kind of longterm goal to consider helping them. They're too busy liberating vending machines to think about it. If you decide to help them they blow up half of Commonwealth. I'm not joking, they're going to overload the Institute's nuclear reactor.\n\nBrotherhood of Steel are still being jerks towards anybody and taking what they want at gunpoint. They're really no better than bandits, they are just better armed and more fanatic. Their goal is to clear Commonwealth of all scum, meaning super mutants, synths, ghouls and other nasties. They also blow up the Institute's reactor.\n\nThe Institute is the boogeyman of the Commonwealth, in short they're mad scientists with no real goal in mind. They produce synths (synthetic humans), kidnap people and replace them with synth copies. Why? I don't know. They also like to tell you that synths are mere tools but why do they insist on making them indistinguishable from humans? They tell you that replacing all humans with synths is the best hope for mankind. They are also responsible for super mutants being present in the Commonwealth. They experimented with the FEV virus and instead of disposing their failed experiments they let them go to the surface. Initially I was ready to join up with BoS even though they're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s but they had clear motivations about what they want. I changed my mind about betraying them after hearing that I'll be the next leader of the Institute and thought that I could change all the insane things they're doing. Unfortunately as a leader all you get is one meaningless choice and repeating quests.\n\nSpoilers about factions end here\n\nFinally the ending, it's weak. All you get is two different slides with commentary that barely differentiate from each other. They're literally called "Male A, B. Female A, B"   You don't get anything about what happens with your companions, your settlements, the people you met or the cities you visited. Nothing.","December 1, 2015","false","176.7"," 822 of 1,392 people (59%) found this review helpful 40 people found this review funny","59","822","1","40","46"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ringhloth/recommended/377160/","ringhloth","ringhloth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ringhloth/","351 products in account","Fallout 4 is okay. It's not revolutionary, it's not fantastic, and it's not what every open world post-apocalyptic rpg should be. I don't exactly recommend people to not play it, though I don't know if I'd recommend buying it at full price. If you're really hankering to play a Fallout game, play New Vegas to your hearts content. If you're really sick and tired of playing New Vegas, you'll get enough milage out of this and more to enjoy the price range.\n\nThe Good -\n- The crafting system is pretty great. I was pleasently surprised by it. I expected just an expanded version of FNV's system, which wasn't compelling because finding specific ingrediants for things was so boring. Instead, every item (mainly junk) has components, and those components are what's used to build new things, rather than the items itself.\n\nThe Okay -\n- Perks are... okay. It doesn't signficantly change the game, really. The interface for selecting perks is, thankfully, significantly better than Fallout 3's. So nothing really good, nothing really bad.\n- Building settlements is... okay. Maybe I'm just not a builder, but I don't find it that compelling. It's not perfectly smooth, and a first-person builder is rather clumsy, but it's not frustratingly so.\n\nThe Bad -\n- Don't expect any revolutionary story telling. Bethesda has always been great at building worlds and making the game fun to play, but terrible at writing compelling characters. I've yet to meet any really dynamic characters. Everyone feels flat and one sided. It's at the level of Fallout 3, though the companions are slightly more interesting, where the system itself (of companions reacting to actions and then engaging in special dialogue when you hit a certain threshold of liked) propels it above 3, but the flat writing doesn't stand up to FNV.\n- VATS isn't significantly better. Charged crits are a good idea, but it's a little wonky, and the same old problems FNV had of your executions taking years is still present. Not only that, but now VATS doesn't pause the game, which is the entire point of VATS.\n- The game seems like they decided to port it to the PC at the last minute. Which they clearly didn't, so I don't know how some of the terrible interface choices made it to release. All of the dialogue is limited to 4 options (90% of the time it's yes, no, maybe, and info) and the most intuitive way pick choices is to use your arrow keys. The favorites menu also expects you to use your arrow keys, and this time also hitting enter after making a choice. Favorites also no longer pauses the game, so you better grow a third hand if you want to make full use of the favorites menu during combat. When was the last major PC game that asked you to use WASD, the arrow keys, and your mouse?\n- Player dialogue is a huge step back. Always being limited to 4 choices is very limited for a game like Fallout. They've taken out any indication of how difficult a speech check is besides a very vague color, which is a huge step back. They've also done what many games have done and given you only a vague idea of what your player is going to say. I don't know if "Sarcastic" means a playful joke, or me being an enormous ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. And half of the dialogue choices have "Sarcastic" as an option. Why can't you just say what my character is going to say? "Sarcastic" is not descriptive of what I am going to do.\n\nAll in all, Fallout 4 is an okay game. Terrible interface design decisions and bland storytelling plague this game, leading it to just be worse than FNV, and not significantly better than Fallout 3.","November 10, 2015","false","86.7"," 3,088 of 5,276 people (59%) found this review helpful 125 people found this review funny","59","088","5","125","48"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/KatxInfinity/recommended/377160/","KatxInfinity","Kat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/KatxInfinity/","87 products in account","Edit (Original Review found after the jump):\n\nThis article[sinisterdesign.net] makes several smart points about the definition of "RPG" as we use it now.\n\nIt concludes that an RPG is a game that features "player-driven development of a persistent character or characters via the making of consequential choices."\n\nI know people gripe about not being able to make "meaningful choices" in Fallout 4 (in comparison to previous Fallout games, or other CRPG's), and in a lot of ways I agree. But the reviews I was responding to don't say "Fallout 4 is not a CRPG", they say "Fallout 4 is not an RPG!!! It's an FPS!!!".\n\nThe game limits the kind of choices you can make in order to streamline the experience and focus on a bigger market. They didn't remove choice completely, as what you choose to do still absolutely affects both subplots and the main storyline, but they did limit it pretty significantly.\n\nI want to re-state that just because it doesn't have as much choice as previous Fallout games it doesn't mean it doesn't have choice at all. There is a difference between not being able to do as much of something and not being able to do that thing at all.\n\nThe "RPG" world isn't cut and dry. And for people making the distinction that "jrpg's are different!!!" : No. They're not. They are still RPG's. It's just a sub-genre of a much broader category. Just like Action-RPG's, which is honestly what I would consider Fallout 4. But as such, it is still fully an RPG.\n\nIt's just not as much of a CRPG as it once was. But it is most certainly not an FPS (the shooting mechanics are way sub-par in comparison to the current FPS market), and it is definitely not an Action / Adventure title.\n\nDefinitions change with time. Gaming, and gaming categorizations, are not a science. I understand people are upset that the game doesn't fit their expectation of what they thought it would be. There are things I miss from previous Fallout games, too. Did that curve my enjoyment? Maybe a little. Not enough to dismiss the game as a failure, or to label it a "non-RPG". It just means I needed to adjust my expectations. Expectations set by the audience, not the developer. We were told we'd be delivered an expansive RPG with better graphics, better fighting mechanics, an overhauled weapons modding system, new building mechanics, and a streamlined narrative interface. That's what we got.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe people who are complaining that this "isn't an RPG" because your character comes with a backstory are forgetting the Final Fantasy games, the Kingdom Hearts series, every Zelda game ever.. are those not RPG's then? Because there are few "choices" to make in those games, and all of the characters we play have set backstories. But it's still an RPG. "RPG" doesn't mean you literally get to role play every part of your character.\n\nYes, I understand that that's what we're used to from Fallout. But, to be honest, Bethesda's Fallout games have never been "true" Fallout games to begin with. They began by essentially scrapping the feel of the Fallout games that came before, and are simply evolving their take on the world once more.\n\nTo say that this game "isn't worth it" simply because it isn't the same game we've gotten twice before is ironic. It isn't an FPS. Not by a long shot. A game having passable shooting mechanics does not make it an FPS. It is fully an RPG, but with a stronger focus on story than we've gotten before.\n\nDoes this mean you don't get to still explore the world? No. There is still tons to do in Fallout 4. And just because your "choices" don't affect the main storyline as much as in other games, doesn't mean the subplots aren't heavily affected by who you choose to be, what you choose to say, and who you choose to align yourself with.\n\nFallout 4 is a different game than Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas were. Just like those titles were completely different from Fallout 1 and Fallout 2. That doesn't mean that they weren't Fallout games. And it doesn't mean that this isn't a Fallout game, too.","November 22, 2015","true","156.9"," 671 of 1,136 people (59%) found this review helpful 31 people found this review funny","59","671","1","31","47"

What was going to be another much-expected installment of the dark, gritty and intense survival game we have all grown to love, became a watered down, Borderlands loot-and-shoot with base building elements.\n\nThis game parades as a Fallout game, but given how much the gameplay and story elements have suffered, you can hardly call it a true one.\n\nI've been a Fallout fan ever since 3 came out, and this game is just insulting. It's insulting the fans who wanted an actual Fallout game, and it insults all the efforts the community poured into fixing the previous games, only for Bethesda to never learn.\n\nThe only excellent part of this game, and what in my opinion, all the effort went into, are guns and visuals. Guns feel powerful and are extensively customisable. The visuals can be eye-candy, but that's really all.\n\nThe story and quests are atrocious. Gone are the varying, interesting quests from the previous games. Instead, we get repetitive, Borderlands-level quests. Fetch that, kill them, it's all the damn same after playing for a few hours.\n\nThe settlement/crafting system is even worse. Settlement is pointless, it doesn't give that much of an income, and it takes a ton of time to actually even set up a decent base. It's an unnecessary grindfest to get the materials you need, and it's not even worth it in the end.\n\nThe story is disappointing from what I have heard, and so far, all the characters I have met are as interesting as trash on the street. Zero character build-up in the beginning, a Mass Effect convo-wheel, pointless Charisma responses, cliche story line and a talking character finished this off for me. Charisma responses only yield you extra caps, I have never seen a single manipulation technique via Charisma in the amount of playtime I had on this.\n\nThese are my personal gripes and problems with Fallout 4. A game that panders to the current generation of console and casual players, with zero regards to the actual fans who kept this series breathing. An insulting final product to all of those people.\n\nGet this game on sale, as a full price for such a disappointment is a no-brainer. If you want a less-gameplay orientated experience, get this. If you want to experience an actual Fallout game, get all the previous games. Even Tactics is better than this.","November 12, 2015","false","126.4"," 567 of 959 people (59%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","59","567","959","20","27"

I was so excited but I was faced with poor optimization and disgusting graphics on low settings, the only setting I could play on for the game to actually be playable. Not only this, this is a terrible port, the PC controls feeling very odd especially when moving through the menus. AND NO SUPPORT FOR 4:3/5:4 ASPECT RATIOS? ARE YOU ♥♥♥♥ING KIDDING ME? Edit: After playing the game after getting all of the issues sorted out ( Except for the Aspect Ratio problem ) I noticed the story was extremely bland. Also, the dialogue is quite limited... In previous Fallout games at times we had over 6 options to choose from and then subsections for those options, this game only has 4 options, commonly a Yes (Yes it really gives you just "Yes/No"), no, and gimmie money then yes option, I find this extremely lazy and boring, I loved being the protagonist in Fallout 3 and New Vegas, it made me feel like I was the character; your character having a voice scared me, and it is probably the worst decision they could have made, they must of thought that if it was voiced they could just slack off...

What you get is an action first-person shooter with a few RPG elements. Something like, Call of Duty with quests.\n\nAs a fan of the Fallout and the Elder Scrolls series, I am strongly dissapointed  with what Fallout 4 came out to be.\n\nBefore saying what's right and what's wrong though, let's just get out of the way the usual Bethesda problem. BUGS. They are everywhere. They block you from completing quests and progressing in the game, literally making it unplayable. Now, the 40 hours I have played involve me, discovering the bug or unavoidable CTD and literally going the OTHER WAY. The biggest one is a huge area in the middle of the map that is glitched and you CTD by setting foot in there - blocking ALL quests in that area and making you unable to progress (i.e.When riding the Vertibird with Paladin Danse, right above the glitched area the game just closes)\n\nPROS:\n1. It actually runs on day-one, unlike other games (*cough* Batman: Arkham Knight *cough*). However, unfortunately nowadays our standards (and this is what most Positive reviews of F4 are based on) are THAT low. We think it is a positive think that the game actually LAUNCHED.\n\n2. Character is voiced. Especially the female one is pretty decent.\n\n3. Crafting - though you need skills to hit the right pixel to place your object...\n\nCONS:\n1. No longer an RPG. Sadly enough, this is evident during the very first 5 minutes that you launch into the game. You can no longer be the person YOU want to be. Forget being the evil chemist who melees everyone, or the stealthy recluse with the silenced sniper. For some reason, Bethesda decided to force a backstory to you and give you a preset character (not talking appearance-wise). This isn't your story any more. You are forced to be the kind little husband/wife whose spouse was killed and who has a son who he/she must find. This is who you are. This is what every dialogue must revolve around.\n\n2. Character creation. Frankly, it's wax museum at its best, and the barely on par graphics definitely add to that. Although the creation itself may sound exciting - being able to sculpt your character's face with your mouse - NPCs around the world, for some reason, share very similar face bases. For example, Diamond City's major is basically your old husband. Or, given the same clothes, the only reason you can distinct between Pipper and Cait is the (awesome) accent of hers. Everyone looks like they were based on the same preset face and just had a few things changed - something that makes the people you meet mostly unmemorable.\nIn addition, Bethesda didn't even bother changing your character's hand textures, so whether you play Male or Female, the hands have the exact same (male) texture.  Funny, I played around 10 minutes on my female character accidentally this morning, and I realized it when I went 3rd person that I play a female.\n\nAlthough a minor aesthetic thing to some (though due to the "guns nature" of the game, you are basically playing more in 1st person than 3rd person, meaning that you see your characters hands around 80% of your play time) it points out that Bethesda didn't f*king bother. Something that highlights what I always said. This game needed at least an extra year of development.\n\n3. What everybody talks about: Graphics. To be clear, they are not bad, but they are not good either; and from a company that brought Skyrim (a game that had me spend my play-time watching a river flowing calmly due to it's amazing textures) this is unacceptable. It is unacceptable to be using an engine from the 2000's that requires a modern PC to run. At this point, at least for me, the graphics between F:NV and F4 don't differ that much. There ARE parts in the landscape that may make you go "wow" but mostly it's just outdated graphics that are so bad that almost look cartoon-ish, like they imported them from Telltale's Walking Dead or Wolf Among Us.\n\n4. Dialogues. Plain bad. This copy-paste they did from Bioware's 4-answers wheel is something that I will never understand. Forget choosing an actual dialogue to reply to NPC's like in F3 or F:NV. Your options are always "Sarcasm, Maybe, Yes, No." Sure, "No" means no and "Yes" means yes. However, choosing Sarcasm or Maybe is really a gamble. Your character will either say something funny that means "YES" or something funny that means "NO." There is literally no way to tell if it's "Sarcasm I Agree" or "Sarcasm I Disagree".\n\nMoreover, most dialogues are at best taken out of B-movies. They are unimaginative and something that a child would come up with - no offense. There is no "soul" behind what you say. No "smart".\n\n5. The map is literally SMALL. I had around 4 hours played when I decided to see my map as a whole by zooming out. In my surprise, I had explored almost 70% of it by simply following the Minutemen quests and 1-2 Miscellanous I picked up. Then I also discovered that the right part of the map is actually a huge sea. Now, since I didn't bother going there (it's sea afterall) if every bit of this part is playable (and I mean if there is content - not just swim around taking Rads) then the map is decent, but again, NOTHING compared to Skyrim. If it's not, well then the map is literally small. I can go back to Skyrim right now with 900hrs played on Steam and another 700 off-Steam and still discover places.\nWhat was the name of the f*ker who said that this will be larger than Skyrim? Todd Something??\n\n5a. City's are small. Diamond City, for example, the Jewel of Commonswealth, the main shelter of the game in the middle of the map that houses shops and stores and people around the area is like Dawnstar (Skyrim) at best in size. It's basically almost as small as the shelter (Megaton) you bomb at Fallout 3. It literally has 10 buildings including shops/houses and around 20 residents who most of them just sleep outside. No "real" city to see and explore - just a small District/Market area as you enter and a few ruined houses around. No back-alleys. No wealthy or criminal-based areas. It's just small and unintresting.\n\n6. The story. Other than being forced on you, it really is boring for the most part. By forced, I mean the whole "find-your-son" thing they chose to give you. And on that, you are in a way compelled to complete it since it's an urgent matter - isn't it? Would you be doing Misc quests and building a shelter while you know your child's gone? You'd want to "fix" that first before bothering doing anything else in-game, which throws people off. At least those interested in an RPG experience. Moreover, there are several things that add to the story being boring.\na. The bad textures/character models add on that. I am not talking about the non-synced lip movements. For a second you are smiling while discussing what happened to you in the vault, then suddenly you choose the "Yes" option and your character goes crazy, mad that "OMG MY SON WAS KIDNAPPED." It's kinda creepy.\nb. There is just no "soul" behind the story. Just another cliche you'd expect from an Indie game. I expected the outcome since the start.\n\n\nCONS: Minor\n-A really weird decision on development includes the fact that you are given the Power Armor - Fallout's Iconic piece of armor - literally during the first 15 minutes.\n\n-No real "talents" system.\n\n-No "Survival" theme. Just a shoot-em-all FPS.\n\n-Holstered weapons dissapear from existence.\n\n-Companions are a PITA since they always get stuck/bug.\n\n-many more...\n\nThere is no space left for conclusions, so all I say is  wait for the game to be on a sale and HOPE that the modding community will fix this mess.\n\n\nHope I've been helpful","November 13, 2015","false","167.8"," 696 of 1,181 people (59%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","59","696","1","29","28"

I really want to like this game. But it's not a Fallout game. This game takes what made Fallout a unique and great as a game and completely flushes it down the toilet. There is little strategy in this game, skills are gone and with it the careful planning of making specialized character builds. There is no level cap, you can get all the perks in the game with one character, and you can get 10 points into each SPECIAL stat. Bethesda has choosen not to go along with the damage threshold system featured in New Vegas and has gone back to the arguably inferior damage resistance system, meaning that a gun that shoots ten thousand bb pellets a minute will do more damage against an enemy wearing power armor than a high calliber rifle, so there is generally no reason to go with anything but the weapon with the highest damage per second. Weapons and armor no longer need to be repaired (with the exception of power armor), meaning that having multiples of the same weapon or armor in your inventory is uneeded weight for the most part, once you have a weapon or armor you will never need another of the same kind. The new dialog system is uttterly terrible, you can only guess what your character will say from a few words for each option (which you only get 4 of), so quick saving during dialog is advisable as it isn't uncommon for you to expect your character to say one thing and then totally say the opposite.\n\nThe pc version of this game feels as though it has been very neglected, as if it were some retaliation to the paid mods fiasco for Skyrim. The promise of an uncapped frame rate seems to have been a flat out lie, as the game's actual speed is directly tied to it's framerate, and attempts to uncap the frame rate in the config files makes the game unstable. This is absolutely unacceptable for a AAA game in 2015. The game also still runs on the same engine bethesda has used since Oblivion (but of course a very updated version), and it shows. Despite this, the game is extremely demanding for it's lack of decent graphics, and I personally have had trouble maintaining over 60 fps with an overclocked GTX 970 and an intel i7-4790k with decent settings, and there doesn't appear to be much of a difference in fps between low and high graphics settings. Menus such as the pip boy are a pain to navigate with a mouse, even worse than they were in Fallout 3 and New Vegas. Mouse sensitivity is a big issue, verticle sensitivity is half of the horizontal sensitivity, which makes little sense being that this game seems to be more of an fps than an rpg. There are lots of tall buildings and you will often be shot at from great heights, making it annoying to aim with the lower sensitivity. Mouse acceleration and mouse lag caused by the needed v sync for stability make aiming even more frustrating, and aiming down the sights with a weapon makes the mouse sensitivity slow to a crawl. Raising your mouse sensitivity (which must be done out side of the game because it lacks such simple options) will make aiming easier, but you will find your mouse flying across the screen when you use it in menus. Vats mode no longer pauses the action, which may seem a purely good change, but selecting parts of the body to target becomes more difficult than you would think when the target is moving.\n\nThere are pros to this game, but seeing how the majority of reviews of this game are positive, I'm sure you can read about them there. There are also a lot more cons to this game, but the ones listed here are the ones that I was most disapointed about. If it's enough for you that this game has the name "Fallout" then you will probably enjoy this game. If not, you will probably be disapointed.","November 13, 2015","false","57.9"," 178 of 292 people (61%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","61","178","292","3","0"

You know how in F3 and FNV there were neat little things hiding behind every nook and cranny? Every inch of the map told a fun story, and each little shack and camp had an "implicit tale" that was told by the world design. Some were silly, some were funny, some were sad, some where disturbing. Skeletons in bathtubs with a shotgun positioned on their head and blood splatter on the wall, and if you dig around you can find a little note. But not so with F4! It's just generic terrain as far as the eye can see with the occassional loot pickup. Go back to F3 and you see bottlecaps positioned on tables as if someone lived there. In F4 it's all about streamlining the loot drops (bottle cap stash? c'mon). Who made the decision that the performance/visual gain from reducing the number of interactable world objects was the right trade? In an open world RPG? Next-gen graphics is not why people play RPGs! As I said, we're dealling with COD:Wasteland here.\n\n3) Yeah I get it you designed the UI for console. Guess what. I play on a PC and I miss the previous dialog system.

You were rewarded for paying attention to the NPC's mood, and the subtle cues from his/her text. This ME ripoff is simply not suited for a Fallout game since the point of playing a character in a story-rich RPG is having control over what he says!\n\nI'm the sort of player that has like 100s of hours into pretty much every open world RPG I touch, and that includes multiple Bethesda Titles.

I will be giving some extensive "backstory" so If you don't want to read that and be informed on what's going on with the controversy with Bethesda & this game, skip to the -------- for the game review itself.\n\nSome small part of me really hoped that Bethesda would have learned their lessons following the recent abyssmal series of failures they have created for themselves in the recent past such as the paid mods push for Skyrim, their tendency to controversially sue any and all games (& indie developers) that have fallout in their name (see Fortress Fallout), their decisions to release versions of games they know full well are broken (see Skyrim for PS3 & Fallout: New Vegas for all systems) and their line of colossal failure titles (Rage, Elder scrolls online, Brink)..\n\nBut.. Nope. They keep the tradition of idiocy rolling stronger than ever before this game was even released by ruthlessly hunting down and banning & blocking & t-bagging & suing any and all people who shared as much as a screenshot of Fallout 4 outside the official trailers before the game had been released globally for everyone (Owners of review copies & people in Germany literally got burned at the stake). They even went as far as to force Steam to ruthlessly hunt down and ban & permanently shut down ANY Steam accounts that tried reducing the incredibly unfairly made store set timer by changing their country of origin to access the product they've bought a few hours faster as friends in other countries were playing it. I'm not even kidding, this happened to HUNDREDS of people: http://i.imgur.com/TjEObhD.png\n\nWitnessing all of this in real time as I was myself waiting for my copy to "unlock", I couldn't help but to stop and ponder in fright as to just why they would choose to act out in these levels of rètardation.. Was there some incredibly dirty secret they were oh so desperately trying to shovel under the rug? Was there in fact only a small tutorial area for Fallout 4 and nothing else beyond that? I kept making theories until I decided that It was enough guessing and I took to the Internet to download the illegal child-porn ràpe equal that was the two hour stream "gameplay leak" video from my local P2P website, I sat down and calmly watched through it. After two hours, I went "What the f*ck is all the fuzz about this?", as the entire video was the guy doing the starting area and little to nothing else with only a few very minor bugs happening for him.\n\nDumbfonded over their actions at this point, I pulled some strings with a few contacts of mine and got myself the release version of the game early for me to play. I spent some time making a solid spec that could handle me going Survivalist at square one and at this point in time, I have played this game for about 80 hours.. And all I can say is: "Bethesda, You dun' fùcked up."\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nFallout 4 is a mind-boggingly catastrophic failure through both a design perspective and on a purely technological level with a shockingly large amount of reports being posted on the Steam forums (and elsewhere) of startup crashes, program hang-ups, dialog freezing, audio cutting, black screens, micro stuttering, pixel distortions, missing audio, disk writing errors, memory leaks, screen flickering, freezing UI, crashing drivers, broken mouse & keyboard inputs, horrid performance for pcs both above and below recommended specs, broken aspect ratios & resolutions and the list just goes on and on for over 200 pages on the Steam forums.\n\n"What about the design then?" you ask? Facepalms everywhere here as well I'm afraid. To simplify things, I'm gonna list some of them off:\n\n\n1. The graphics. Going along with the flat-out lying that Bethesda has made about the FPS & resolution not being capped for the PC when they both are ( http://www.pcgamer.com/fallout-4-resolution-and-frame-rate-wont-be-limited-on-pc/ ), you also have a game that is incredibly ugly for It's time with It's lack of detail only managing to work against itself as guns are as of right now, all wrongly represented. Aim down your sights over some cover? You're gonna hit the cover instead of your enemy. Why? Because all shots originate from an angle that is around the player's torso instead from the barrel of the gun you're shooting. Wanted to play the game in third person and have your character use a gun? Good luck. It's about 25 times worse there, especially at close distances.\n\n\n2. The dialogue system. Ripping off Mass Effect.. I mean, REALLY BETHESDA? Before, you had the choice from an often vivid list of possible dialogues with friendly (and not so friendly) NPC's that always managed to keep you intruiged with what they had to say. It often rewarded you for being a good listener and If you happened to have any particular set of skills to help a situation you were conversing about, you could jump in and show off. Other times, you would just indiscriminately stumble into interesting characters that you could have hilarious dialog with and no matter how many times you re-played the game, It would still be just as funny as the first time.\n\nIn Fallout 4, this has ALL BEEN REMOVED and replaced with (99.9% of the time), and I shìt you not now:\n\na) Sarcasm/More info\nb) Maybe\nc) Yes\nd) No\n\nThey are uninformative as all hell as to just what your character is going to say when you pick them (Exact same problem from Mass Effect) and they are all depending on the voice-actors to add some flavor to conversations being had in the game when the script is the embodiment with that of a dead, farting camel. You may be surprised by the smell but once you take a good look on what you're indulging in, you get the strongest of urge to back off as fast as possible without ever looking back. It can also be argued for that the addition of the protagonist being fully voiced only helps to damage what little chance of immersion there was left to have in this game as no matter what the player does, he will remain to be the same, stereotypical "Hurr durr, i do dis fur my familie" guy.\n\nTo sum it up: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=551675456\n\n\n3. The difficulty settings. This is easiest one of my biggest personal complaints. The game has a variety of difficulty settings which you can change at any time and It starts off at normal, going up to hard, very hard and then finally to Survivalist which is the hardest of them all. What does this Survivalist difficulty do? Reduce the speed of how fast your health regenerates from healing items and amps up the HP & damage for all enemies. That's it. It is the most disgusting display of pure artifical difficulty I have EVER encountered in a game that gives itself the audacity to be called a "New release" in the year 2015. There are literally THOUSANDS of things Bethesda could have done to integrate a much more interactive & fun way to challenge players (rather than just slapping 50000 extra health & damage on every single creature) such as a more fleshed out medical/healing system ( For example, how awesome wouldn't this be to have: https://youtu.be/5JpQ401QVlA?t=1m28s ) but instead, everything has been depressingly dumbed down to three items. Food for HP, Stimpacks for damaged limbs and Radaway for radiation. That's it. Know those three and you're a head chief surgeon for life in Fallout 4.\n\n\n4. Progression. Last point ill make due to text limitations, The way they have handled character progression in this game is downright grotesque. Want to specialize or progress on your own terms using perks? Too bad, play like everyone else and wait for the stated levels to become better/unlock that specific thing. Next to ALL of the perks in this game have their second perk level be locked behind level 17+ which is just absurd as you can average level 8-10~ after 4-5 hours of play.\n\n\nYOU HAVE ALL BEEN WARNED.","November 9, 2015","false","60.1"," 1,622 of 2,777 people (58%) found this review helpful 102 people found this review funny","58","622","2","102","62"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grizzlybomb/recommended/377160/","grizzlybomb","Grizzles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grizzlybomb/","136 products in account","As much as I didn’t want to, I’m going to have to give Fallout 4 a “do not recommend.” However, that doesn’t mean that this is an inherently bad game, or that you will not enjoy it, rather I feel like it was marketed as something it’s not. Let me explain:\ntl;dr: Dumbed down RPG to appeal to the masses. If you want an RPG experience do not buy this game. Wait until its on sale.\n\nThe main improvement to the game is the gunplay. It is vastly improved over the previous games. Everything is a lot more responsive and fluid. Guns have feedback and just “feel” good. To add on to this is the upgraded weapons modding system. It allows you to customize your weapons to fit your playstyle, such as adding a long range scope, adding a suppressor, reducing recoil etc. This system also works on armour and power armour as well. Wearing power armour actually makes you feel above human compared to previous games. Some other features such as the base building (more later) have also been added. Lastly, one small change that I like is the change to the radiation system. In the previous titles rads were almost no threat at all. Now, not only do a lot of enemies deal radiation when they hit you, but instead of an incremental status debuf, each point of rads lowers your total health pool.\n\nThe other positives of fallout games are still here, but they more or less have stayed the same, without changing at all. By this I mean the exploration (although they have used a lot of copy/paste boarded up buildings you cannot enter), wide range of NPCs, lots of different items etc are all good.\n\nNow for the negatives. The main issue is the dumbing down, or “streamlining” of the game. If you want a good RPG then this is not the game you want. Gone are skills, which have now been more or less replaced by the perk system completely. Instead of leaving barter for example you take the barter perk. Most of the perks are quite generic (ex 20% more damage with rifles, or you can now pick expert locks). This limits the amount of creative perks because they make up for the lost skills. Why not implement both like before?\n\nSecondly, as most people know about, is the horrible dialogue system. Every dialogue choice is Yes, No, Sarcastic, Info. That’s it. Not only that, but that is essentially how they are listed so you don’t even know what your character is going to say. There is absolutely no reason for this change. Thankfully there are mods that display the full line, but it’s still inexcusable from Bethesda.\n\nThirdly is the quests. Talk about generic and boring. If you played skyrim I’m sure you are used to the “I need x in dungeon y. Go there, kill everything and get it.” quests. Now it is the same except you are fighting raiders instead of draugr. Sure, there are a few interesting quests but they are surely limited. A lot is even reused from FO3. (Ex, remember the leaking pipe repair mission in megaton? That mission is recused almost the exact same). This leads to the story. Although it is subjective, personally I think it is garbage. Completely uninteresting and linear. Some quests are so cliché its almost cringe worthy. It is such a huge step back from all the branching and interesting writing done in NV.\nThen there are the secondary issues that is just lazy game design. The graphics are definitely an upgrade, but for a 2015 game they are pretty bad. That would be okay if you didn’t need a beast of a machine to run it at a decent frame rate. The optimization is so bad and I have encountered numerous crashes. These PC issues carry on to the control layout. There is no button mapping. For a AAA game that is pretty sad. They have even bound multiple actions to same button. You want to melee attack you press alt quickly, but if you want to throw a grenade you hold alt. If you try and melee attack but hold alt slightly too long you just threw a grenade at your feet and killed yourself. Not only are the controls not mappable, but there are default options turned on that you cannot change without editing the .ini file. For example, there is a default mouse acceleration turned on that you cannot turn off from the menu. The FOV is set to 80 andwill not change in the console, so you have to change it or have guns take up 1/3 of your screen like so:\nhttp://imgur.com/GUkOEfx\n\nI know its preference, but the difficulty of this game is far too easy. I’ve played on Normal up to Survival. My character has 1 strength, endurance and agility. I have taken no perks in damage or improving combat really at all, and have only used my power armour for the very first death claw. The game is still no challenge. There is soooo many healing items its basically impossible to die. You get so much health from food that you don’t even need stimpacks (I have over 100). If you turn the difficulty up enemies just become bullet sponges which is equally unsatisfying. You now just have to sit there and fire hundreds of bullets. But there is still not challenge as you are sitting on a mountain of healing supplies.\nTo finish it off I’ll talk about the base building. It’s okay, but not great. I really enjoy sandbox type games and was really excited for it but I was quite disappointed. It’s cool at first but it starts to become quite the grind fest haulting all the junk around from place to place. The actual building does’t work very well, some types of walls don’t snap to a grid, items have bad hit boxes so they are not placeable without big gaps in-between them (Junk walls are particularly annoying for that), and walls will float in the air if they are not on even ground which I can’t stand: http://imgur.com/C4KSMR9\nThe mode feels more like a gimmick than anything else. They have also removes some great features that were present in NV, namely the NV survival mode where you need food, water etc, removed types of ammo and ammo crafting (for what purpose?) and limited the survival crafting system.\n\nThis is where I feel the game falls flat. It’s trying to be too many things at once. It’s dumbed down RPG mechanics, but kept a bit there. It’s removed interesting stories and quests for a more action focus, but there are still lots of quests. It has improved shooting mechanics but still are quite poor compared to an actual shooter. It has added some quite shallow sandbox mechanics. Removed lots of survival mechanics, but kept a small amount. What is this game trying to be? Personally, I’d much rather they had removed some of the features of one genre and focus on another instead of trying to make a jack of all trades kind of game. When I think of fallout I think of a survival themed RPG, and this is not what the game is. If an open world, action oriented game is what you are looking for then you will probably love this game. If, like me, you wanted a more RPG/survival game then play New Vegas if you haven’t yet.\n\nOverall, based on its many flaws I give it a 6/10. I expected a better game technically and mechanically, and as it stands it is not worth the $80 price point (CAD). If you want an RPG and still really want to play it, wait until it’s on sale to pick it up.\n\n\n\n\n\n","November 30, 2015","false","25.8"," 548 of 929 people (59%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","59","548","929","29","7"

Alpha Protocol has deeper systems than this, honestly. I might as well be playing COD: Wasteland with a quest system.\n\n2) The world design is just lazy. You know how in F3 and FNV there were neat little things hiding behind every nook and cranny? Every inch of the map told a fun story, and each little shack and camp had an "implicit tale" that was told by the world design. Some were silly, some were funny, some were sad, some where disturbing. Skeletons in bathtubs with a shotgun positioned on their head and blood splatter on the wall, and if you dig around you can find a little note. But not so with F4! It's just generic terrain as far as the eye can see with the occassional loot pickup. Go back to F3 and you see bottlecaps positioned on tables as if someone lived there.

This is game is not going to be one of them. I will be requesting a refund.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI want to clarify what I meant by "lazy world building."\n\nin both FNV and F3, even in the new player areas, it felt like I couldn't go behind a hill without "finding a location" that had basically a mini-vignette. And it's not just about skeletons in death poses, it's the feeling that somebody used to occupy this space, and it's really just a lot of little touches and attention to detail. In F3 and NV the world was just filled with random little details (if you pay attention) and plus maps were HUGE. You could tell a well-staffed experienced team spent a lot of time world building. It's like for every shack and gas station they asked "who lived here? what was he doing?"\n\nThis is what it means for *me* to be immersed in an RPG -- the suspension of disbelef that the world exists with or without me, and I'm just passing through.\n\nI found F4 totally lacked this. And yeah, it's a feeling thing... but so is "fun" and everything else important to game aesthetics. I want feel like a location is a legitmate place in the game world that I "happen" to run across, rather than solely existing to supply me with loot for the next scripted battle. I felt F4 was mostly the latter.\n\nMaybe other players don't care about these sorts of little touches, but for me when I play an RPG it really matters to my immersion in the world. Otherwise I just see right through to the treadmill skinner box and I might as well be playing an FPS/shooter.\n\nWhich brings me back to my main contention is that F4 isn't an RPG game. F3 is, NV is, but F4 isn't. If Bethesda wanted to make an FPS fine, but that is not how the game was advertised and honestly it's a huge waste of the Fallout license which is primarily an RPG franchize. In a larger sense this is a very disturbing trend I see in the industry... a large company buys a beloved RPG franchize, and makes a shooter out of it and burns the core franchize fans because cashgrab. Then buy a new franchize, rinse/repeat. It's parasitic behavior.","November 10, 2015","false","2.2"," 1,023 of 1,748 people (59%) found this review helpful 38 people found this review funny","59","023","1","38","37"

It means that almost everything that made Fallout what it is is stripped out.\n\nThe skill system has been stipped away and replaced with an utterly dull perk tree. Remember how excited you were when you levelled up in the previous games? Well forget about that because it is not a pointless process done only if you feel like crafting or lockpicking.\n\nGone are the days of having to plan your character and roleplay as a specific type of individual, instead the addition of endless levels and being able to upgrade your S.P.E.C.I.A.L. skills with level points means you will be a jack-of-all trades (and a master of them all). This is great news for casuals (who bethesda clearly targeted) but awful news for anyone looking for a deep role playing experience and replayability.\n\nThe story is dull and awfuly slow. Not going to spoil anything but its just 'meh.'\n\nYou can only be one character. The concerned (maybe sarcastic) dad. Want to be evil? Well you cannot be. Maybe a bit naughty but if you are looking to be that devil you were in Fallout 1,2, 3 and New Vegas you will find it utterly impossible here.\n\nThe dialogue is widely complained about so I won't go into much detail. All I will say is that its either Yes, Yes?, No (Yes), or a sarcastic yes. No options, no variety, no roleplaying, no depth.\n\nThe art style is way too cartoony. I have no issue with the below par graphics but the art style just dragged me out the game completely. I'm not saying it had to be as grim as FO3 but something more realistic like New Vegas would be good.\n\nLooting is terrible and this destroys the drive to explore. Exploring is of course the basis of a Fallout game, so when the most interesting thing you find it a bottle of wonderglue you have a problem. The weapon variety was stripped back to allow for crafting, which is great and all but now you no longer find great weapons because all you have to do is craft them. Armor is ugly and making power armor a vehicle is a poor gimmick in my opinion. The only way anyone can find looting exciting is if they are obsessed with the underwhelming crafting element.\n\nSpeaking about crafting, thats another underwhelming element. Not only is it very clunky (very difficult to get walls to click properly, or align fences), but also completely useless. Sure its cool to have a badass base, but what exactly does it do? No one else can see it and nothing ever attacks it meaningfully so whats the point? This element has been done better in countless games. It feels like bethesda just threw it in because its a treding thing.\n\nThe locations and characters are dull. No life to them, no cool secrets hiding about in them (except one or two spots). Vaults are awful, and considering they were a highlight of previous games this is unforgivable.\n\nQuests are mostly repetitive fetch quests. You may at first be overwhelmed by their quantity....until you realize 95% of them are go there, kill that, repeat.\n\nCompanions are just as stupid as previous games, and more dull.\n\nOn the plus side the game did not have as many bugs (In my experience) as previous games. The Weapon modding is cool, and the robot modding added by automatron is nice. Shooting is also a lot better than previous games, and V.A.T.S. is no longer neccesary.....\n\n\nHowever thats where the big problem comes in, you can see that shooting was bethesdas' total focus. They built a shooter with RPG elements. That for me is just disgusting. To take a deep, ongoing series of RPG's and make it into a shooter series more akin to Rage that Fallout is disgraceful.\n\nThats not mentioning the abysmal handling of DLC, where Bethesda nearly doubled the cost of the season pass when it decided it could milk more from us.\n\nAll in all a decent shooter but an awful fallout game.\n\nAs a shooter 7/10\n\nAs a Fallout game 5/10","May 13","false","87.1"," 400 of 676 people (59%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","59","400","676","20","29"

I have enjoyed both games. I liked the world of Fallout 3 more but prefer New Vegas gameplay more. I have waited for Fallout 4 since i finished NV. I knew it will be a Bethesda game, i did not expect a miracle like the Witcher 3. Maybe that‘s why i‘m not disappointed with the game. I liked it from start to finish.\n\nYou start the game by creating your character as always. This time you have a nice costumization options, you can create a handsome guy or sexy woman same as you can create some really badass looking or plain ugly characters. After short time you get thrown into a game, bombs fall down and the world as we know changes. Only war, war never changes. After you wake up you find that your child is gone and you go on a journey to find him.\n\nThe story is pretty nice, i did not expect a good story, but i enjoyed it until the end. Also first time in the series i loved other characters. In previous games i didn‘t care for anyone, in this one i loved to chat with my companions and get to know them and little stories behind them were quite interesting. Of course not every character is likeable. There is one you will hate from the start. And he‘s become another internet joke. Skyrim had „arrow to the knee“ and this one has...well, i don't want to spoil it for you.\n\nThe gameplay is similar to previous games. Shooting mechanics are improved, now the game feels and plays more like a shooter. The world is nicely done and you will spend many hours exploring it. After 2 hours you will say „ok i‘ll clear this building and turn it off“ and another 2 hours pass and you‘re clearing 5th building already and you can barely hold your bladder. It‘s really addicting. The world is small in scale, but locations are very close to each other and there‘s so many of them that they will keep you busy for hours. There is another couple of new things. First being, you can finally hear the voice of your character. I don't if it was needed, i guess it only made dialogues more simpler and shorter. Also now you can build your own settlements and invite people to live there.\n\nGraphics are nice, i love the colors. Hated the green and yeallow/brown tint in previous games. In Fallout 4 the colors are realistic. Time of day and weather can change and it looks gorgeous. Character models sometimes looks very good and sometimes they look like they came from Xbox 360. All in all graphics are nice to look at. But performance is not very good. In an empty part of the map you will get 60fps, but in busy areas fps will drop to 40 or even 30fps because the game renders shadows underground. Yeah dear Bethesda, you really have a talent.\n\nThis time the game feels less RPG and more FPS. The dialogues are dumbed down, there‘s almost no choices and even when you can choose it doesn't matter what you choose, the outcome will be the same. Same as the Walking dead. But i don‘t know if it makes the game worse. I loved Fallout 4 and would pre-order Fallout 5. For me Fallout is all about exploring while listening to an amazing in-game radio stations. But if you expect a 100% percent RPG you will not get it. It‘s more of an adventure shooter with elements of RPG.\n\nOf course the game has plenty of mods which could add things and improve almost anything. I can‘t really imagine this game without mods. After the first hour of playing i already had some mods installed. Official modding tools are coming soon.\n\nIn conclusion i would recommend this game at full price.

The wheel pretty much seems to just follow the pattern of "what?" "no" "yes" and "SARCASTIC". The new perk tree feels awful compared to how SPECIAL and traits were in past games. I don't know why Bethesda refused to acknowledge any of the good changes Obsidian made in New Vegas and reverted back to things like chance based dialog checks. Why even make the playable character voiced? It's not like his delivery is that great. If they were trying for a more "cinematic" experience, they failed at that too considering how jankey the camera is when it goes into 3rd person for these conversations. All they've accomplished is stifiling creativity. Want to play as an comicly evil elderly man? Too bad you talk like you're a mild mannered 30 year old who likes being sarcastic sometimes.\n\nI'm going to finish my playthrough but I can't say this is what I wanted from a Fallout game.\n\nBut they improved the shooting outside of vats.

Thank you.\n\nFallout 4..... The first thing I'll ask you to do is look at my steam hours, it will put things into perspective... Now look at the number of negative reviews on steam, seriously, read through them. I was originally going to write a whole review, listing everything that's wrong with this game but then I just read the steam reviews... Why beat a dead horse? Everyone has already pointed out my main problems with this game, I have nothing new to add to this conversation. It's a mediocre game on it's own and a horrible Fallout game and I'm glad it didn't win game of the year at the award show and I hope it continues to lose to the Witcher 3 and Metal Gear Solid V.\n\nI'll say this though. My heart goes out to the people that worked on this game for years and put their all into it... All of the programmers involved, the incredible art team at Bethesda, the voice actors, like Brain Delaney and Courtney Taylor, for this game to turn out like this is unforgivable in my opinion and I blame the Direction not the individuals that I assume didn't have much say. Bethesda is absolutely out of touch with this franchise. Fallout 3 showed signs of it but they were easier to forgive since it was their first Fallout game. This game semented it in and proved that they don't know what they're doing.\n\nAnd that leads me to my main point. A letter to Bethesda... Here's my advice. Do what you're good at doing, stop experimenting by trying to further simplify existing systems that were already simple and the whole "starting over" thing, with each game you guys make. When you're making Elder Scrolls 6, take a step back and reuse your leveling system that was in Skyrim but tweak and REFINE it instead of trying to REDEFINE it. Do what Obsidian did, add more RPG elements without making it complicated for new players. You guys have literally no reason to remake the leveling system or add a voiced protag.\n\n\nIgnore people that crave and over overemphasize innovation in this industry, like Angry Joe and several others, I couldn't disagree with that more. We the fans have to wait 3 to 4 years inbetween new Bethesda titles, you don't have to reinvent the wheel when we're stuck waiting so long inbetween releases, master the wheel and make it perfect instead. Also, stop trying to be Bioware, you may have gotten away with turning Fallout into Mass Effect (somehow!?) but I have a feeling you won't get away with it as easily with the elder scrolls. Fans and critics will pan you for it not being enough like Skyrim, I know it.\n\nEveryone has already played Skyrim, everyone gets that system, so all you need to do from here is add features and "smarten up" the gameplay instead of "dumbing down" since everyone already gets that system because of how popular Skyrim was. Improve the writting on top of that and you have a solid formula. There is a balance to hit here and I think Bethesda is capable of getting there, even though they refuse to admit that you can make a good open world RPG without sacrificing story. I hope you're next project is good but I'll be honest, if it looks anything like Fallout 4, (which it probably will) I won't be purchasing it.\n\nAnd lastly, I ask you guys to allow Obsidian to make a new Fallout. They get this series better than just about any other game developers. They deserve to make a sequel to Fallout New Vegas and to rob them of that would be really sad. That's all I've got.\n\nEDIT: At the time of writing this I had 30 hours played in game.\n\nEDIT 2: Well, it looks like it's officially confirmed that Obsidian will never make a Fallout game again. http://i.imgur.com/JCWqBgQ.jpg http://i.imgur.com/glgMBiE.jpg and lastly... http://jesawyer.tumblr.com/post/143129802911/so-ive-followed-your-qa-series-for-quite-a","December 4, 2015","false","64.1"," 49 of 71 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","49","71","0","0"

You can throw a whole bunch of parts and pieces together and make something, but it doesn't mean that what you made is good.  Scale of 1-10.   M'eh  about a 5.\n\nI do not normally take the time to reveiw a game, but Fallout 4 has been a little bit of a let down and it is just another reminder of how hard it is to find a really good game.  It's not a horrible game, I wouldn't mind playing it more if there wasn't four or five different ways to exit a menu, depending on which one you are in.   Thats a little ridiculous.  There are other problems that are really holding this game back, but beggers cannot be choosers.  I have not tried my hand at modding the game because I don't really feel like working on something that is lacking in areas I would not be able to fix.\n\n\nDoes anyone really care that the son was kidnapped?  NO....  Why make that the story line in the game?	Why waste the time, effort, and money developing a story line that no one will ever care about?  Just sayian.   There is only one point to these games so why try to cover it up with a useless stroryline that, OH YEAH, you can't follow because you will get killed the second you try to.

I do... But until modding steps in to fix this game, there are a lot of major issues.\n\nThe first big thing I noticed is that when the game defaulted me, it set my monitor from 1440p down to 1080p. That was really not desirable, so I bumped it up to 1440p. I logged in, and there was a 20 FPS cap. I even set the game settings to the lowest they could be at 1440p, and there was still a 20 FPS cap.\n\nSo I looked up how to remove the cap, and it is altering Fallout4pref.ini, one string from a 1 to a 0. Problem is, that doesn't let you -change- the cap itself. Now I normally don't care about that, as I want it to run at a high FPS, but the next thing I'll talk about explains why that is an issue. So now I had 1440p with about 100 FPS.\n\nFunny thing about this game: Physics is tied to the FPS... The same error and crap that has happened with games like Dark Souls. This means things move faster, lockpicking is tough as hell (pressing A-D to turn the screwdriver happens instantly so it breaks your pick often), but more importantly, that using terminals will 9/10 lock you in place after finished using the terminal. There's no way around it, not even "tcl" in the console to enable no clip. You're simply trapped in place.\n\nAll of this happens because the game is running at around 100+ FPS. Okay, well, I don't -need- 100 FPS, but I definitely need more than 20. Problem? I can't set the cap. It is either 20 FPS that is jagged and terrible, or 100 FPS where there are numerous gameplay issues.\n\nThese are basic things that really isn't and shouldn't be acceptable in a game in 2015.\n\nEdit: Okay, so it turns out this happens because when you release the FPS cap and you do stuff in lockpicking/terminals, it stops processing other background graphics. So your full GPU is going to processing just the lockpicking, just the terminal. This means your FPS jumps an insane amount, and the speedup is incredibly noticable and leads to problems.\n\nSo the fix: You need to set an application based FPS cap using a 3rd party program. I believe Nvidia Inspector has a way of doing this, but for you AMD folk: Install MSI Afterburner and as you do, it'll also install "RivaTuner Statistics Server". In that program, all Fallout4.exe to the left side list. Select it, and then set the Framerate Limit to no more than 110 FPS. This way, the game will -never- process more than 110 FPS and problems will stop.\n\nNote that this will not stop the game from having a speed up effect based on frames. You naturally swing faster, people move faster, etc. all when the FPS is high. That effect is still going to be there, so be ready for Fallout 4 to be a faster game.\n\nI am keeping my review how it is because in 2015, I shouldn't need a 3rd party program to play a game at higher than 20 fps. I love Fallout, but it isn't excusable to ship a game this thoroughly borked and depend upon modders to clean it up like they did with Skyrim and the rest.\n\nEdit 2: Okay, it didn't actually fix the terminal bug. I have gone down even as far as 90 solid FPS and it still screws up.","November 10, 2015","false","42.5"," 138 of 225 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","138","225","4","4"

Most of these will probably be resolved in future patches or by the community when the GECK gets released.\n\nIn terms of it being an RPG? Yes. It's still an RPG. You play a role. No.. it's not a fully controllable RPG in the perspective that YOU can be completely how YOU want to be. That's unfortunately how Bethesda wrote it. You still have ALOT of freedoms in how you handle situations.. (via stealth.. via guns blazing.. via diplomacy, in some situations, etc.) Despite not being able to go an all-out evil route and people respond completely (YOUR companions will.. they will leave your a$$) it still meets the mold of an RPG. Not as story-engrossing as say the Mass Effect series.. but you still steer the direction of the overal story arcs.\n\nIn terms of it's place in the Fallout franchise? It was a good game. Not the best in the Fallout series (IMHO). I still prefer the breaking the mold of Fallout 3 and the overall tone and gameplay of Fallout New Vegas. The new breed of Fallout is nothing like the early isometric Fallouts.. so no comparison there.My Scoring...Graphics - 8 Despite some of the technical issues.. the graphics were pretty amazing, if not TOO post-apocalyptic. Future bugfixes, High-res packs, mods, etc. will improve this considerably.Sound/Music - 8 The sound was fine. Ambient noises, Radios, etc. Mods made the sound so much better (better birds, better storms, quieter settlements, etc.) More variety of radio music would've been nice.. but it was decent overall. (Magnolia was a nice touch. I enjoyed most of her lounge-singer'ish songs)Gameplay- 8/9 Lots of interesting stuff to do made this a fun playthrough. I'm a decorating junkie when it comes to MMO's that have the feature, having SOME after-ending quests was a nice touch.. despite the latter ones being radiant. The release of the GECK and future DLC's will improve upon this dramatically, as it has with most of the previous Bethesda titlesStory - 8 I enjoyed some of the storylines. Some of them were very engrossing and pulled me in. Others I found.. well.. I feel the factions could be a bit too extremist for my tastes (doesn't mean that's bad tho). No.. it's not Mass Effect level storytelling.. not even Skyrim level.. but it was a decent overall story arc with some nice twists and turns to keep it interesting.Overall Score: 8(9 after bugfixes and the GECK release allows for better mods)","January 7","true","503.7"," 514 of 879 people (58%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","58","514","879","37","37"

The engine is showing its age. The game runs really badly. (EDIT: Some of this can be fixed by turning off Vsync in the .ini files.) Few crashes at the beginning, but after that nothing. Some keys can't be bound and some keys have multiple functions bound to them.\n\nIntro Sequence: Very cool, ultimately. I liked the overtones of the whole thing and how devastating the situation felt.\n\nFirst hour of gameplay: Basically you're playing through the gameplay trailer. You already know every beat of it. It's boring, and where I think I went wrong was abandoning the NPC group after I killed the deathclaw. What I mean by that is that it took me another three hours to find the first NPC after that.\n\nGameworld: Very messy and chaotic. Maybe they wanted it that way, but I have no idea where to go or what to do. I'm carrying a bunch of gear with me in case I'll need it at some point. There's nothing to do except opening random doors and killing whoever's behind.\n\nQuests: I didn't do that many of them. Like I said, after the cinematic tutorial mission I didn't run into any NPCs. After four hours of gameplay I got my first mission, which was a pretty generic: "Follow me and if you happen to kill anyone, great!"\n\nEquipment: There seems to be A TON of equipment, guns, and all that good stuff. But I played like five hours before I found the first vendor in the game. So, I was constantly just throwing stuff away. That's no fun.\n\nSkills: There aren't any.\n\nAbilities/Perks: I don't know why, but it seems BGS gets their biggest hard-ons from simplifying their products. Then again, that's not really different from any other software company out there. They got rid of the skills, reduced the amount of ability points you get in the start, and made the perk tree the focus of levelling up your character with multiple grades on each perk.\n\nThe perk tree is a mess. It's huge and you have to navigate your way around it each time you level up your character. None of the perks seem particularly good because they spliced them in parts. Alternatively you can just assign your point in one of the abilities. In my opinion they simplified the wrong thing and it created a huge mess that benefits no one.\n\nStory: I don't know. They just didn't make me care at all. You really need to find this thing and feel emotions because this happened! Nope.\n\nAudio/Graphics: Mostly mediocre, sometimes bad.\n\nCan't really recommend. I don't hate it, but it's mostly so boring and mediocre that there are better ways to spend your time. A lot of the same problems Skyrim had.","November 10, 2015","false","49.0"," 712 of 1,223 people (58%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","58","712","1","20","11"

I was so excited to see where they would take it after new vegas but I have to say honestly that I have never been this let down by a game. It's nothing but a cash grab by Bethesda. The graphics SUCK, even maxed out, the AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the character development systems are dumbed down, the dialogue has been reduced to the following (yes, no, maybe, sarcastic), there is no longer a karma system so you can't actually be a unique character, the game is buggy to no end constantly crashing my computer even though I have a really nice computer (gtx 980's in SLI, i7 4790k etc....)

I'm not saying that to get attention, because it hurts me to say that as a loyal and avid Fallout fan.\n\nLet me also make it clear that I am having fun playing this game, but it is dumbed down casual fun, like casual sex, which is nice for a brief period, but once you step back and look at it from a bigger perspective, it is obvious that this instalment does not have the 'internal beauty and charm' of its predecessors and this is not something I would want to replay or be in a long-term relationship with, at least in its current state. Hitmarkers are now in, just like COD.\n\nI could spend forever going over each of these downgrades, so please feel free to browse the other Steam reviews here (most of the most helpful and most endorsed ones, are negative) and you'll get a good idea of what I'm talking about. Not to mention the infinite bugs which have made me both cringe and laugh out loud in equal measure. Also there are too many pet peeves to mention here but to name a few particularly nasty ones:\n\n- 1). New to Fallout, you are now not able to wait wherever you damn well please in the wasteland, now you have to follow the rules set by Bethesda and find a bed or couch to wait.\n- 2). Children and followers are still immortal because Bethesda does not want you to do what you want and suffer the consequences of your actions. The moral arrogance of this is disturbing.\n- 3). Weapon/armour degradation/repair/jamming have been scrapped as part of Bethesda's dumbing down of the RPG genre. Even though I know that many players, especially those new to the series, are happy with this change, for myself and other RPG lovers, this was an important mechanic which brought a sense of connection between the player and the equipment you carry. Without it, you no longer have those classic tense moments when your hunting rifle jams or breaks altogether just before you fire the finishing shot at a super mutant. Now, your guns have no more required maintenance other than loading ammo, which never jams, just like COD, and feel just as plastic and arcadey.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSo. Do you remember these really cool things from Fallout 3 and New Vegas?:\n\n+ Karma (that cool mechanic which let you personally control and shape your character's sense of morality, and which brought a sense of meaningful connection between action and lasting consequence);\n\n+ Skills (that in depth character customisation option which let you specialise in key areas and made your character have a unique set of skills, distinguished from everyone else);\n\n+ Reputation (that amazing mechanic which let your character have a lasting, but nearly always alterable, fame/infamy in each of the key communities and factions, depending on the choices and actions you make);\n\n+ UI which encourages intrigue and exploration and let you see your pip boy inventory next to the container contents you are examining (I'm not talking about the HUD, I'm talking about the loot/inventory menus) - in this game, you don't even have to open a world container or examine a dead body for loot, you just walk up to whatever and a huge glowing menu will magically pop up In mid air Borderlands-style, detracting even more immersion from an already rather plain world - this is a recurrent theme of this game, 'Bethesda will do it for you' - Bethesda probably thought this new menu system was innovative and encourages 'seamless' exploration because the player does not even have to press a button to check for loot, but in practice it has the opposite effect);\n\n+ Intriguing open-ended in-depth dialogue where you feel like YOU, as a person playing a video game, are speaking/being spoken to, to/by people in-game  (in this game, you never have more depth than 4 options of Yay/Nay/Dunno/Bold statement, and the character you create at the start is strictly controlled and restricted by the generic prerecorded voice and personality of Bethesda, not your own personal and free projected voice like in Fallout 3 and New Vegas);\n\n+ Immersive and unique story and side quests and world map  (I personally don't care that the new world map is small, as long as it is detailed and unique and not generic af - but unfortunately it is);\n\n+ The iconic Power Armour being a long-term goal which you had the pleasure of working towards as a hard earned reward  (you now get it for free 10 mins in) .........\n\n........... have all been thrown away      :D\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYes. You heard right.\n\nThese things which make a timeless, replayable and pleasurable game to play, are not to be found in this game. This takes a huge poop on the head of Vault Boy and loyal Fallout fans.\n\nIt really does feel more like Bethesda's huge failure of a game, RAGE, which admittedly did have really fluid and fun GUNplay along with very pretty graphics. But that game was a shooter with RPG elements. The same logic has been applied to Fallout 4 here.\n\nThis has been Bethesda's biggest mistake with Fallout 4.\n\nThe Fallout brand is first and foremost an RPG, not a shooter. This is why Fallout 3 and New Vegas were so highly and widely loved by gamers from all spheres and platforms. Fallout 3 earned GOTY in 2008 because most gamers value story, narrative, immersion, and freedom, over merely good gunplay and graphics (these last two aspects do not stand out at all in Fallout 3 and New Vegas, in fact they are often seen as being below average quality).\n\nModders - you now have the grand project of bringing this potentially amazing game to life.\n\nGodspeed and may the spirit of GabeN guide you in your journey.","November 11, 2015","false","54.0"," 134 of 220 people (61%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","61","134","220","7","9"

I was really pumped but... dissapointment on the horizon as this game was clearly intended for console. Here are a few reasons:\n\n- Low res textures: A lot of objects especially small ones have low res textures that look washed out and blurry. There is really no crispness to textures except on character models and certain parts of the terrain where they look more decent. You would expect smaller objects to have better textures but they are so washed out a rust bolt just looks like a blob of brown and orange. Unfortunately the games looks best when looked at from a distance with all kinds of lovely weather effects.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/marand2013/screenshot/391046545658912160\n\n- Low Poly: The game is quite low poly, I can understand that dense areas are more intense on the rig but really the buildings just look like they were copy and pasted in parts with little effort.You really get a feeling that as you approach the centre of the map with high density of objects the polys and textures just go down.\n\n- Average Physics: The game physics are nothing complex. Use a minigun to shoot a lantern? Won't even dent it. As for smashing lights and making it dark, well not possible as far as I have played. Ragdoll physics on people nothing special. The physics engine  could be compared with that of CoD with the only exception that in F4 you can move certain bodies around and throw cups, boxes or other items around. Also need to mention some objects are stuck to tables like lanterns.\n\n- Lack of Pc specific features: I had to modify ini files in order to get the proper FOV slider, eliminate mouse acceleration and remove the 30fps cap.\n\n-Construction feature: Interesting concept I can see potential in it but its too easy to just scrap a whole house in 1 second and instantly get all the items from it.\n\n- Glitches, bugs and performance: Well to start off my cursor moved to 1/3rd to the left of the centre. This bug seems to appear at random for me. I have also had my character FOV revert back to the console default a few times despite my changes in the .ini files. As for performance, I feel the engine is quite dated either that or not very well optimised for PC which wouldn't be a surprise.\n\nI am ruuning an i7 4770k at 4.0 Ghz OC with a GTX 980 Ti, 16 GB of ram at 2400Mhz and Samsung Evo SSD. I see no reason why my fps should drop below 60 considering the low poly count of some buildings but it drops quite often even to 50. Mind you I am playing at 2560 x 1440.\n\nI would suggest you wait and see how it unvelops. It is not worth paying £40 or $60 for a game that was made for the console and just ported to the pc with not even the most basic features. Its almost like making a car for the UK roads and leaving the steering wheel on the left.\n\nP.S Can't play game at all now cause my monitor goes on standby after about a minute or so and have to reset.

I'm not going to complain about graphics or glitches because I myself am not a graphic freak and have yet to encounter glitches. The game runs well and I'm suprised because my setup didn't fully fit what the minimum was.\nBut here are my reasons as to why I do not like Fallout 4\n-It feels like it was rushed\n-Terrible and boring dialouge\n-Power Armor and Minigun at level 2\n-Story that didn't catch me but I had to follow because there were only 2 NPC's in my area (Codsworth and Dogmeat)\n-Bland story so far. Just go kill this, help this, kill this, look for him.\n-The beginning made it look promising but then they freeze you. No story in the vault other than (Not spoiling) but you know what happened\n-The map is incredibly small and its a 20 min run across but in games prior it took much longer even with no clip at max agility\n-The crafting is confusing and not very interesting\n-They re made a world that was over. The new designs of weapons make no sense unless they were only in Boston\n-The game was meant for a controller\n-No mouse settings. Mouse speed up is ridiculous and the Mouse sensitivity is a joke\n-NPC's are very jittery and like to speed up and around. They never want to engage from the front\n-They turned the ghouls into zombies. Just really fast buggy zombies.\n-This games only true hope with me is for good DLC but that might not even make me change my mind.\n\nI will say this. Its not a bad game at all. I do enjoy it a little bit but its not a Fallout game like we enjoyed before. Its a game with Fallout strapped onto it, using only the most basic things from it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalalification/recommended/377160/","kalalification","Kali","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kalalification/","252 products in account","Fallout 4 is an okay game. A solid 7/10. But it's not better, on really any level except the gunplay, than Fallout: New Vegas, which came out half a decade ago. It's a downgrade in many areas for the even older Fallout 3.\n\nA lot of people are complaining about the map size, I personally think the map is fine, there's as much content within its boundaries as there was in NV or FO3, at least. But the real issue with Fallout 4 is that the content you find in these locations is pretty meaningless. Much like Fallout 3, the overwhelming majority of locations you visit are strictly there so you can kill everything inside and loot it. There are a mere handful of areas where there's an actual quest or a town.\n\nMost of the time you spend playing will be spent shooting at raiders, Super Mutants, ghouls, or mirelurks with extremely same-y and gross looking weapons. Occasionally you'll fight Gunners or synths instead. Nearly all of them will be wielding the ever-disgusting and loathsome pipe weapons, the most common type of (literal) garbage gun in the game world, which you will spend (at least) the first few hours forced to use. There are only two actual pistols in the game, the 10mm and the .44. There is only one assault rifle, called simply "Assault Rifle" and it's one of the ugliest weapons in the game as well (which is saying a lot, nearly all of the weapons look terrible). Given FO4's focus on gunplay, its weapon variety is abysmally, apocalyptically bad.\n\nAs with Fallout 3, the actual game world of FO4 is extremely uninteresting. Aside from (some of) the faction HQs every location is made out of literal trash, and nobody is doing anything meaningful. Bethesda's continued tale of basic survival being the main focus for most people on the East Coast remains incredibly boring compared to the vibrant and active West Coast of other entries. There is only one actively lived-in city in the game, and it is very small and very lifeless.\n\nThe player character is not customizable, you are forced to be a worried, good-natured parent and you cannot deviate from it. The dialogue system in this game compounds that by allowing you to "choose" between four options that basically boil down to "Yes, No, Sarcastic, and Huh?" You don't control what your character says, and at best you can make a reasonable guess as to what the option you select will actually mean. It is not possible to be evil, or even to not care about your family. Nothing you do actually has any consequence on the plot or the game world, except for the faction you pick, and even that has extremely minimal effects.\n\nIn short, this game may be decently fun to play, but it is several steps back for the series as a whole.\n\nUPDATE\n\nA lot of people say they don't understand why I would rate this game 7/10 and not recommend it. Consider for a moment what a 7/10 means. A 70%, or a C-. A passing grade, technically, but not a good grade. This game is priced at $60, and frankly I don't consider a game that's merely "passing" worth that much money, let alone consider it to be a good Fallout game.","November 14, 2015","false","99.6"," 1,769 of 3,069 people (58%) found this review helpful 81 people found this review funny","58","769","3","81","132"

You always start off as a concerned parent and you stay concerned parent. Special basically doesn't matter in this game. YOU CAN BE 10 ACROSS ALL SPECIAL, EXCEPT CHARISMA AND IT WON"T CHANGE ANYTHING. Seriously I found one, just one inteligence check in this entire game, nothing more. The only checks that are left are Charisma based and 95% they are like this: Give me more caps. That is it.\n\nYou can't roleplay in this game, because the dialogue is limited to 4 options and it doesn't matter what you take 99% of the time, it all leads to the same god damn conclusion.\n\nThe voice acting is one the worst decision they could have made. I gave them a chance but this is just bad. I have never felt connected in any way to the main character, I never cared what happened to him. He is not me, he is some sort of idiot that even with 10 intelligence can not draw even the most simple conclusion, like when he leaves the cryo sleep he is convinced that it happened like a week ago, for gods sake.\n\nNPCs:\n\nNow onto the characters. Most of the NPCs in the game are boring as hell. Even companions are hardly interesting and the way the react to your actions and how long it takes is poorly designed. For example, there is Curie, who you can impress by being nice, siding with Railroad, etc. I did many things like but it still takes ages to romance her and I hate this system. In Fallout NV companion quests were much better solution than this terrible system. And there wasn't even one time I cared for my companions. They are immortal, why should I care? The only companions I like so far are Dogmeat and Cadsworth, but other than that I want to shoot some of them in the face.\n\nAnd here we get to another stupidity of Fallout 4- essential characters, they are almost everywhere. Basically, You are connected to the quest, I can't kill you. It breaks immersion and is annoying when there are some NPCs, like Mama Murphy who you want to shoot in the face, but you can't. The only thing you can do about her is to build her a chair, somewhere where no one will ever find her.\n\nCharacter Progression:\n\nNow let's talk a bit about character progression and how inferior it is compared to Fallout NV or even Fallout 3. In both of those games you had to pick your special carefully, otherwise your build would be flawed and you would suffer a lot. They were RPGs that punished players for making stupid builds and mistakes. You could not become a Jack Of All trades because levels and perks were limited so you had to be careful what to choose. In Fallout 4 though, there isn't such thing. You can become 10 across all special, or even 11 if you pick boobleheads just by leveling up. There are very few builds that will make player miserable, such as the one focused on Charisma so it much less punishing than previous games. It is more streamlined, which for me is not a good thing.\n\nAnyway, as you level up you can either boost your special or take a perk, which sounds good on paper but in practise it takes away from the game, because the most important thing in this game is to get you damage and let you build weapons. Other builds are much less optimal. It wouldn't be that bad, but because Bethesda cut out Skills, karma and reputation there almost no alternate ways to do quests. The only instance that required high int and nothing more was found by me after 40 hours of playing the game, which is just bad.\n\nMain Plot and Sidequests:\n\nNow onto the quests and main storyline. The main quest takes the player through the ruins of commonwealth in order to find Shaun, the son of the Protagonist. Unfortunately it is quite predictable, and does not allow too much flexibility. In the end we find him and we have to decide which faction to support. So the main quest is bad, but it has never been great in most Bethesda games or even the most important. Side quests were the most important part of playing Fallout games. For example in New Vegas, there was a quest in Goodsprings, where you could side with either the town or the powder gangers. Doesn't seem impressive, does it? HOWEVER, you could join one of those sides whenever you wanted or even back stab the one you supported, for example: Side with powder gangers, but lay mines on the road and kill them all before they come to the town or just murder them after everything ends so you could take all that sweet loot.\n\nAnd once again Fallout 4 disappoints in that regard. 90% of the quests are like this: GO THERE, KILL RAIDERS/RESCUE SOMEONE, GO BACK. The amount of radiant quests is staggering and quests that are not radiant still disappointed me most of the time. The issue with them is once again is that there are very few alternate ways to them. The only good quest so far for me is: Silver Shroud, a bit cliche and still not that great, but I enjoyed it. Unfortunately I can not say the same about most of the other quests.\n\nCombat and No level cap:\n\nBefore we go into combat though, I want to pinpoint a tiny detail, which is no level cap. Sounds awesome doesn't it? Unfortunately it once again is poorly designed system that does not work well with the franchise. This game features way too many radiant quest that are meant as nothing more, but a grindfest. This game is full of grinding, grinding and grinding, otherwise your character is just weak and it still not done that well, because you receive little experience for most of the quest and it would require hundreds of them to get you above level 100, which just plain stupid.\n\nNow, let's talk about the combat and difficulty. I have to admit it is one of few things Bethesda managed to improve. It feels much more fluid and natural, although it is still nothing incredible, quite mediocre I would say. It is still a step up from Fallout 3 and NV, though. Unfortunately the same cannot be said about difficulty. As I was playing with my level 250 character (cheats, I wanted to verify something), I came across a super mutant suicider with level 250, the same as my character. I think you understand what that means? Level Scaling and Bullet Sponge Enemies are the bane of this game. How is it that .50 caliber sniper rifle does nothing against him, even though I hit it in the head??? It is really frustrating. And the game is full of them + legendary enemies are basically buffed up versions of them. Also the different levels of difficulty are like this: you deal less damage, take more damage, enemies deal more damage, enemies take less damage. Just bad.\n\nRight, legendary enemies are enemies that spawn randomly in the game. Whenever you kill one of them it drops an item with additional effect, such as: Penetrating laser musket (ignores 30% of armor or something like this). Sounds good on paper, but most of the time you get something like this: Ghoul Hunter Gamma Gun (Deals 50% more damage to ghouls) with radiation? So it does nothing against them, in fact it should even heal them more, which makes no sense. Sure not all enemies scale, but it is still poorly designed system, with way too many flaws.\n\nCrafting:\n\nNow, lets talk about weapons, crafting and armor. It is great that you can modify your weapons, power armor and such. It feels natural, they also completely removed weapon degradation so you don't need to worry about carrying 10 rifles, so you could repair your favorite one (it got tiring, I admit that but in New Vegas there were weapon repair kits making it a piece of cake to repair). However, that lead to the fact that the most important aspect is crafting. Also materials like alumminum being the most important thing in the entire game + armor and weapon inflation. The game becomes too easy with couple of mods to hunting rifle.  You waste so much resources on crafting it is not even funny and it is required in main plot, so you can't really skip it.\n\n\nLAST PART IS IN THE COMMENTS, LAST PAGE, 3 LAST COMMENTS.

I spent several hours trying to get the whole WASD thing happening, but in the end, trying to override decades of habit was a pointless, futile exercise.\n\nI've had no crashes and am perfectly happy with the graphics running on medium. I like the brighter colours of the game world and the general look of the game.\n\nI also liked the new VATS, rather much to my surprise, as I expected it to be one of the things I hated. It slows the game to the point where you don't feel completely rushed to assess and decide on your enemies weak spots, but not so slow as to remove any sense of urgency. Indeed, I think they hit the sweet spot with VATS, because whereas in previous games, was a useful time to go make a cup of tea, now it contains a welcome element of danger.\n\nI thought that the opening sequence was well done and gave me a good sense of atmosphere. I didn't find it particularly hard to put myself in the mind of the protagonist and empathise with her experience of the end of the world and confused reawakening.\n\nSadly, the game failed to run with what could have been a really engrossing and RPG filled transition 200 years into the future. Almost as soon as I was out of the vault, I fully acclimatised with morphing from a suburban housewife and lawyer into a sociopathic killer. Within 30 minutes of leaving the vault, it was quite clear that I was just another FPS cardboard cutout.\n\nHaving abandoned a potentially awesome "girl out of time" storyline, for one written by hacks, the devs preceded to abandon the survival and life threatening danger that has made previous games great. The first mistake was giving the player powered armour and a minigun at the very start of the game. Now, if this was just a teaser for things to come, with a storyline removal of the armour and gun, that'd be kinda cool.\n\nBut it isn't. In fact after nine hours of gameplay in which I reached about level 6 I had found a total of three suits of power armour and had three cores to power them. Now, any difficulty is a fast travel away from being eradicated (fast travel didn't seem to use any of the power either). Power Armour is the peak of armoured perfection and should not simply be handed out on a platter. When you get it, you should feel like you've achieved something, not been visited by your drunk fairy godmother.\n\nForget roleplaying. Dialogue options in this game are atrocious. with only four selections and no real idea of what your character is going to say. Half the time, one of them seems to be "sarcastic", but you've no idea in advance if that means "♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥", or "witty rejoinder". In previous games, you could actually see what your character was going to say and you weren't limited to only four options. In any case, most people aren't sarcastic, so making that the only "role playing" choice probably speaks to Devs with significant social and relationship issues. Kind, sympathetic, angry, joyful, or worried would have worked just as well.\n\nMind you, given the two dimensional nature of the conversations and NPCs and the fact that all conversations seem to lead to the same outcome, it doesn't really matter what answer you give. Your path has already been pre-ordained and you are going to get on that railroad!\n\nWith respect to NPCs, Fallout 4 lacks the humour and vibrancy of previous titles. Enemies seem generic with little to distinguish one group from the others. Don't expect to find a Moira from Megaton, Sunny Smiles, or even a Gob in this universe. The closest I saw was one character with mystic powers, but the potential was lost through poor voice acting, the crappy conversation wheel and the fact that she only seemed to exist as an accessory to the main story, rather than as a living and breathing person with a will of her own.\n\nThe dumbing down of SPECIAL and perks from previous games is really disappointing. While, a mere 3 points in Agility will enable you to take all the perks you need in order to sneak like a pro, many of the high level perks are marginal, (rooted, nerd rage, sniper, ghoulish and solar powered) or way too specific and pointless for almost any build (Idiot Savant).\n\nEdit: Steam have refused to provide a refund on this unplayable mess, because I spent too long trying to make the damned thing work. This is the last title that I will be purchasing from Steam, as crappy customer service does not deserve to be rewarded.","November 11, 2015","false","524.1"," 324 of 552 people (59%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","59","324","552","18","24"

If you just want this game for open world exploring by all means get the game but if you came here to try and get a meaningful time that you will remember for years you might want to just go back to previous installments of this series. Once you get to the open world it's pretty bland with reused models all over the place and a lack of education for the new crafting system.

In Fallout 3 you start as a kid, you grow up in the vault and learn skills and eventually decide what your character will be like. In Fallout 4 (I chose to play as the woman) my character starts off as a mother and wife, ordinary yet surrounded by future and past elements mixed together, I like it! Then moments later you're in the vault, then (skips spoiler) you have a gun and your killing people, before you know it you're in a powersuit. The progression is much to fast. After this super fast progression of military like encounters you're thrust into building beds, yes building beds!\n\nThe options to customise, build, explore and follow the story make it worth while but my impressions so far are that the narritive really needs some work and the conversation options you choose should make a difference.\n\n6/10\n\n\n* Graphics issues: Discussions about the graphics seem to be due to certain graphics cards, which may be resolved with driver updates. My AMD card does not like the God rays setting on this game, producing giant squares around characters. This doesn't happen on other games.

Compared to other titles, i'd say I got my money's worth. If solely based on that, I would recommend this game.\n\nUnfortunately i'm confused because overall, despite all the hours played, I did not like it. The entire thing feels like a mindless, uncreative game. I can't shake the thought away that, if this game had been handled by another team, it wouldn't have been the mess that it is now. Without giving any spoilers, the plot/storyline is not presented adequately and attempt to dupe the player for a plot twist but ultimately steps on its own feet while trying to do that, which leaves major plotholes confusing the player before you can take the final, most important decision.\n\nThe game feels uncreative because many of the quests are very repetitive, there's little to no place for politics, problem solving or plotting. The only problem solving is in the form of bullets in your enemie's heads.\n\nThe RPG aspect is very limited too, while you can make your own settlements and even equip them with whatever you want (which is fantastic) they will always treat you like a stranger and will never acknowledge you as a mayor, or a superior in any kind of way.\nYou have very little power over your settlements and they are quite limited in size (There is a size limit to towns, which is pretty small) You can't choose the type of settlers you want, you can't attract visitors and the stores you build are solely for your own use and as far as I know, nobody in the wasteland will ever mention anything about your settlement(s), they will never mention how small and undefended or how great and thriving a settlement is nor will they ever mention you being important, rich, or powerful (or the opposite). Even if you own every damn town in the wasteland.\n\nThe conversations are also underwhelming. While not terrible and often quite enjoyable (played as a female character) they are just rarely deep enough, as if no one in the wasteland had anything to say that would last more than a minute.\nThe only NPCs that acknowledges anything about your character afaik are the guards/minutemens, which is fantastic but I wish more important NPCs would do as well, like vendors or quest-related NPCs.\n\nAs for the companions, they're not very useful and will burn through your ammos. If you're not playing a cookie-cutter build (charisma+intellect+companion+localleader or str/end/per/agi/luck+dog companion+lone wanderer) it may be difficult to supply your companion with ammos and just generally have a harder time.\nThey do however interact with the world around when you're not moving and they will have something to say (or people will have something to say about them) often enough to be entertaining. I'd want more, as usual but it wasn't lacking. Their perks however, are all over the place. Some of them gives amazing perks while others are just plain useless, which doesn't help wanting to team up with them.\n\nContent-wise, it's all south. You start the game up north and all the quests/towns are densely packed at the bottom of the map. My first impression of the game was "Where the hell are all the merchants?" which, unless you want to be a smart-mouth and claim that there are plenty of merchants elsewhere, the main merchants are down south.\nThose "other" merchants are traveling merchants, which means they're not always there for you and can be killed by wildlife/raiders/explosions/you, or smaller merchants, which means they won't have much to sell you anyway.\n\nIf, like me, you decided you want to explore the world before doing the main quest (which is located in the biggest city in the game) and avoided to go too far south because\nA) I didn't want to do the main quest right away\nB) I had other ♥♥♥♥ to do like the million things the minutemen asks you to do\nC) The loading screen explicitely tells you the further south you go the more dangerous it becomes\n\nThen you most likely felt the way I felt, the hunger for any type of community/politics/town with interesting stuff to do and hear about. You roamed the wasteland doing "missions" like go there and kill that. Go "help" that settlement (go kill the stuff that harrass the settlement).\nIn Fallout New Vegas, your started in a town (Goodsprings), with interesting people to meet and when you were done with them, a little bit further down the road you had the powder gangers and other communities. It had memorable people, memorable places, things you don't forget easily because they're interesting and not straightlined.\n\nAll those things, despite still not being that much memorable or interesting, are all south.\nThat's where things gets more fun, people to meet, things to do and see that doesn't end with putting a bullet into someone's head, although it does happen and in a somewhat enjoyable fashion, to not spoil anything.\n\nThe pace of the content isn't great at all, i've already mentionned everything being south but there's more to it.\nI made a 5 intellect character (int influences xp gain) so i'm mathematically assuming that my character is intellectually average. I ended up getting my gun nut lvl 4 perk about a few hours away from beating the game (finished the game lvl 41).\nThat perk is required for silencers for high end ballistic weaponry which was the entire point of my character. The perk lvl 3 wasn't much easier to get, I spent most of the game playing with unsilenced weapons because the game just wouldn't let me craft it unless I'm high level enough to get that perk, which by the time I got it, I had already done half the game.\n\nI know this is something every game does but can we just stop that? Can we stop locking everything up until "x" level? It's spoiling the fun for "balancing" purposes, it's not an online RPG, or FPS (since now they all have RPG elements).\nIt doesn't matter if I get that damn perk so fast I can blast people in one shot because guess what, i'm already blasting people in one shot on the hardest difficulty.. I just want to have fun while doing it. I RPed my character as a retired commando, a stealthy lethal mofo you wouldn't want to mess with but spent most of my time shooting my way in because my level didn't allow me to have good enough stealth yet and because I wasn't high level enough to put silencers on the guns I get at my level. Forcing me to spend perks in charisma and other stuff until the perks I wanted got unlocked.\n\nWhen I don't have a blackface, or a whiteface, or grey nights.. the graphics are actually pretty good and very immersive. I love the clothing aspect of the game and the character creation isn't all bad, I especially liked the opacity slider, although not having sliders or numerical pointers for most things makes the creation a bit too clumsy and un-repeatable. It also isn't an efficient way of displaying the set of tools that you have, you're left to a point-and-click minigame to figure out what does what and what cannot be changed.\n\nI'm not sure if i'm giving this game a thumb down because of what it could have been, or if it's because the current game as a whole is not great.. Overall it just feels like a pipelined game, it feels hollow, it has no soul, no passion. The intro is where it's all at, whoever was in charge of the intro and the first hour of the game, did a great job, that was amazing. It's arguable that there should have been more pre-war, to give the player some time to actually care about the characters and get into the pre-war mood but I was and still is thrilled to start a new game, just not what is after that.\nIt's not a terrible game, it was quite enjoyable at moments, wish there was a "meh" button instead of a thumb down.\n\nI still have a lot more to say about this game, without even going into the bugs/storyline/spoilers aspect but fortunately i've reached the maximum length for a review.","December 22, 2015","false","177.3"," 61 of 94 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","61","94","0","0"

Gone is the meaningful choices we got in previous games, gone are the perks and skills that let us get unique dialogue options. They have been replaced by an atrocious dialogue wheel. At one point I was talking with a character and he asks me "What is your business here?" I had 4 options (as always) 1. Sarcastic 2. Surviving 3. Who are you and finally 4. My business. I choose to select my business and what does my character say? (not exactly what he said but) "♥♥♥♥ you I am angry my business is none of your concern you massive ♥♥♥♥." Which took me off guard and annoyed me.\n-Bugs. What else can we expect from Bethesda, but oh well they are bethesda so we should just let that fly.\n-Power Armour. Remember the joy of finally learning how to use power armour? How good it was to walk around the wastelands as a walking tank? Well forget about that because now you can experience that within minutes. If I recall correctly it's the 2nd or 3rd main story mission you get it. Also fuel, is annoying but I guess it kind of makes up for getting it early as you won't have enough fuel to use it constantly.\n-Base building and construction. It is poorly made and seems rushed. Objects don't connect with the ground and levitate a lot.\n-Loot. Do you like pipe guns? Well good, you'll be getting a lot of them. Also the loot is random, understandable on enemies but in the world it isn't great. I loved the fact in morrowind you could venture into a cave and discover some chest with a powerful spell or sword inside. In fallout all loot in containers is random.\n-Level scalling. If you like it than consider it a Pro. I don't, I like seeing my progress, when I can go and kill some enemy within 2 seconds that used to kill me in 2 seconds.\n-More RPG. This is more of an exploration game, little to no roleplay allowed. What contributes to that? Vocied character, since he/she (he more so than she) didn't do a very good job some of the lines can come out very badly and ruin immersion. Like I said before dialogue wheel. Characters aren't memorable, neither are the quests. At least I haven't experienced any yet. I still remember the "town" in Fallout 3 that was 2 houses of cannibals. That was one of my favourites. Now it's just go to this building and get this thing for me, there WILL be enemies to kill in it and you'll have to kill them because that's the only way. The most unique one I've found is the one where you are the Silver man or whatever his name is where you play the role of a superhero/vigilante and have to go around killing the criminals of Goodneighbour. But that still involves go to this building and kill a bunch of raiders and then kill the boss. I just wish they could do some more things. (I haven't done all the quests clearly so there probably is some more unique ones.)\n-Gunplay, though great. I feel they focused too much on this which took away their time to build a better RPG experience.\n-Animations. Oh lord, so much reused from Skyrim. The vault tec salesman has the same animation as when you equip a shield in skyrim except his shield is his clipboard and does the same turn animation npcs would do. See what I mean https://i.imgur.com/7gcVw9D.jpg. It's literally Skyrim with guns.\n-Skills. Are a no show. They're gone. Perks I guess were meant to replace them but you can't specialize in energy weapons anymore because there isn't a perk for it. As I said with the dialogue options, no longer do perks help get new and unique choices. Charisma is the only thing that helps you. And all it does is give you ways of "charming" the npc. Lady Killer doesn't give yo unique choices. It's sad.\n\nSo yeah. Don't buy this game in its current state. Unfortunately we'll have to wait for mods to fix it since bethesda doesn't want to do the work and get ready to pay for those fixes. Wait for a sale please. I was dumb enough to buy into the hype and probably validated bethesda reason to continue it's shoddy practices. It's NOT a bad game maybe 6 or a 7/10 at best if I were to give it a number score but it's just not good. So please, play New Vegas, 3, 2, 1, Tactics or even play BOS but just don't buy this game, at least not itll it's fixed.\n\n*PS\nSince people are asking. I've played 40 hours because\n1. I want to get the most out of a game if I've spent full price for it.\n2. Nowhere in my review did I state it was a bad game, I only ever said it wasn't good nor was it worth a purchase because I know Bethesda can do better and if people weren't like me and didn't buy the game then maybe Bethesda would realize they'd need to make better games.","November 11, 2015","false","76.4"," 520 of 897 people (58%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","58","520","897","19","17"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lingo56/recommended/377160/","Lingo56","Lingo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lingo56/","283 products in account","The first 3-4 hours I've played (2 offline and about 2 online) are... ok. Just kinda ok.\n\nTHE GOOD AND THE UGLY (No Order)\n\nI'm not giving anything on the game's side quests because 3-4 hours really isn't enough for that. I'm keeping this focused only on the core gameplay.\n\n1: The gunplay is better, guns have a definite punch and enemies are much more smart to dodge shots or try and group around you instead of just being stupid. It makes the combat nice, but the best moments in the combat are very much the best moments you get in the past games as well. Stuff like hitting that low crit chance, or having some ridiculous interactions happen thanks to some perk. Also, if I were to nitpick a bit, the gun sounds for some of the weapons lack the punch that others have. Probably will be fixed with a mod, but a small thing I've noticed.\n\n2: The graphics have quite a bit to be desired from. Mostly from the texture department. It really surprises me that this game uses 3 gigs of VRAM on Ultra. The game barely looks like it's using 1 gig. Compared to a game like Borderlands 2, this game just does not hold up graphically or performance wise. This can always be fixed with mods though, and textures are usually one of the first things to be modded in.\n\n3: The character creator is bloody excellent. I don't really have more to say, just I don't think I've ever seen one this well made and implemented. Easily the most fun I've had with the game so far was just tweaking around how my character looked.\n\n4: Animations are fairly janky. This is really sad because all over the place you can see attempts that Bethesda has made to really up the production value for this one, but it's completely shot down once you look at a character's mouth or how their eyes are dead pan. You can see the attempt to bring this game forward a few notches, but either their animators or the crappy old engine just can't keep with the times anymore.\n\n5: The game flows better. In general enemy AI is smarter and much more interesting. Like, RAGE levels of interesting. They have lots of diverse habits and ways of approaching you and it really makes them feel alive. On top of that the movement of your character is much better compared to last games and the gunplay just makes a nice feeling package.\n\n6: Pretty poor introduction in my opinion. I was hoping for some really great stuff in the intro, or at least a really good change of events that would get me motivated. The game doesn't really provide that. Although the beginning is fairly dark, the character's aren't given enough time to be fleshed out so it's interesting. It's always easier to be invested if something happens directly to your main character. I don't think Bethesda understands this because this is their second Fallout game where you're looking for a family member gone missing that I personally don't care about.\n\n7: The music and atmosphere are as great as ever. Inon Zur did a masterful, phenomenal job. The main theme gives me chills, and the environmental music is right up there with Jeremy Soule's Skyrim OST. If you were to skip this game entirely and just buy the soundtrack, I wouldn't be surprised.\n\n8: The game is all over the place with it's framerate, I'll be perfect 60fps at one point but then I move to the left and it's down to 15-30fps. It's crazy. This should be the #1 priority to fix. Right now I plain and simple just don't want to play the game anymore because of the insane FPS fluctuation.\n\nAfter tweaking around with the settings I've now been able to get the game running alright (60fps 90% of the time with rare drops to 40 in cities). For anyone else; lower God Rays to anything under Ultra, set Shadow Distance to the lowest, Lighting Quality only Medium or High, and Actor Fade to about a quarter. Changing these should really help boost performance, also the game looks pretty much identical no matter what you change.\n\nDo I recommend this game for Fallout fans?\n\nWell, if you've played every mod, you've explored every corner, and did everything that you ever wanted to do in the past games and still want more? Yeah go for it. The game isn't significantly worse than the last ones, just disappointing with how little it changes after Skyrim.\n\nIs this a good first Fallout game?\n\nYeah I'd say so. The older Bethesda ones lack a serious amount of polish that can make them hard to get into. If you can get past that they're great, but in 2015 it can be a little hard, especially if you don't take the time to mod them. This one is polished enough that you'll probably enjoy it fine.\n\nDo I recommend it at full price?\n\nWell, can you deal with the issues it has and the usual Bethesda bugs? If yes, and you really can't wait, I guess I can't stop you. At the very least the game doesn't seem to have crashing issues. If I were you though I would just wait some more. Mods and patches are likely to get the game into a much more fun state and fix the rough edges the game currently has. There's a good if not great game hiding here, it's just that it needs some more work put in for it to come out.\n\nI don't fully recommend it right now. Giving it a year for all the issues to be sorted out will give you a better overall game. If you're reading this though, then you've most likely bought it already.","November 9, 2015","false","2.2"," 1,575 of 2,743 people (57%) found this review helpful 83 people found this review funny","57","575","2","83","39"

But most of the people want a game that has choices and not dialogues. However the game was poorly released and caused many spoilers and misunderstandings against the community. Not the mention the lack of optimization currently but I'm just glad the game is still playable. I cannot recommend this game as the launch was a total disaster to many and the optimization for PC was ignored.\n\nMost people will say to high end computer owners to upgrade their potato when they have a stable build to run this game without fps drops. Already the forums/reddit are filled with high end system users who are having trouble with fps drops and mouse problems. I hope Bethesda will fix this soon. I cannot complain about the graphics, it fits the nuclear apocolypse era and puts the player in a place where everything is most likely reset.","November 11, 2015","false","103.6"," 179 of 301 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","179","301","0","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/grumpyviking89/recommended/377160/","grumpyviking89","Kok-cigg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/grumpyviking89/","117 products in account","Foreword\nI do realize that i have played very few hours as of this review posting (4.5hrs), but this is still my opinion about the game. I feel that the points i bring up are covered well enough in the first 2hrs of the game\n\nI want to start by saying that i have always loved the Fallout franchise ever since the first game, which i still play from time to time today. I was one of the many skeptics that were, to a certain extent, proven wrong by Fallout 3 and NW. There were alot of new things to take in and no one really knew what to expect, but it turned out to be a really awesome game! It may not hold a candle to the old games, but thats a discussion for another day...\n\nWith that said, i found "Fallout: New Vegas" to be superior to Fallout 3, which i think is due to Obsidian Entertainment being the developer, and i had hoped that Bethesda might have asked them for guidance in this effort.\n\nSadly, that seems to not be the case...\n\nThe Good\nCombat and environment\n\nBoth the combat and the world is improved greatly since the last entries in the series!\nCombat feels more like an FPS which is an improvment, if you ask me, from both F3 and F:NW. That is not to say that it's flawless, but i'll get to that. The animation, sound and models have all improved quite a bit, and the general feel of shooting is more satisfying than in earlier installments.\n\nThe world looks better! It might just be the general change of scenery, but the game is a little more colorful and pleasing to look at. Mind you that is not only a good thing, but still, it's some eye candy at least! I know some people disagree on this, but i also feel that the design has taken a step forward when it comes to how the world is layed out. There seems to be more usefull stuff too, loot wise, which can only be counted as a plus.\n\nLooting and Crafting\n\nThe looting has improved since it feels like all the stuff in the world has atleast some value and meaning this time around. You can loot and scrap almost everything you see, which makes it feel a little bit more natural, if that makes sense. The fact that there is more incentive to loot makes it alot more fun.\n\nThe crafting system is to me what has taken the biggest step forward. It's fun to see what you can come up with at the different crafting stations, and see what you can create. The look of the armor and guns you craft really gets a home made, scrappy look to them which fits the post apocalyptic setting very well!\n\nAlso the new addiotion of building settlements has its moments. Even though the user interface leaves alot to be desired, it does the job quite well. Setting up supply lines and fiddeling around with various things around town, i can see my self really getting in to that for extended periods of time.\n\nThe Bad\nSkills, "The Perk chart" and S.P.E.C.I.A.L\n\nThis was the first thing i noticed that made me scratch my head in confusion. Why would you get rid of a perfectly functioning skill system and replace it with a cluttered chart? In all the other installments of Fallout, you had the skills menu. In the beginning of the game, you got to tag 3 skills you felt you wanted to build your character around. You could start fleshing out your build then and there. It was fast, easy, and as for character creation goes, fun.\n\nNow we have the chart instead. Am i supposed to sit there and read what all the perks do, and what S.P.E.C.I.A.L stat i need? It was much more intuitive before. Every skill was clearly linked to a S.P.E.C.I.A.L stat. Now they seem to just, with some exceptions, be kinda jumbled around in there and if you did not take the time in the beginning to read up on every single perk, you'd regret it.\n\nAs for the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system it self, it seems to be pointless now. Seeing as how you can just max out all the stats without much more effort than it takes to level, it loses its purpose. You can become a "Jack of all trades" by just leveling and you don't have to plan at all. Sure, if you pick the wrong S.P.E.C.I.A.L stat or wrong perk, you'll suffer for a few levels, but for the game as a whole, it truly does not matter. The whole system falls with this for me. I don't have to suffer any consequence at all, unless i make up my own rules.\n\nDialogue and freedom of choice\n\nIt's not news to anyone that they have remade the dialogue system for Fallout 4. Now we can only choose from a set few key words when we talk to other people in the Common Wealth. This is one of the biggest mistakes in my opinion. I've always loved the Falllout games for thier ability to let me get through the game almost without firing a single bullet. I might still be able do that, but it seems like alot less interesting and down right stupid on some occasions to do so now.\n\nI don't want to click on an dialogue option and expect my character to respond in a certain way, only to have him use a tone of voice or words i did not choose for him to use. In previous games you could read every word and make an informed decision. Now i feel like i'm in the hands of the character instead of vise versa, breaking any ability to role-play or even have fun conversations. Sure you get a few hints in regards to what you can expect, but it's by far the lesser way to have a conversation. The voiced dialogue is no doubt to blame for alot of these issues i presume...\n\nPower Armor and Combat(?)\n\nThe Power Armor is iconic to the Fallout universe, and has always been something to strive and fight for. Now you just kinda jump right in to one during the first hour and thats that! You don't have to play the game for more than an hour befor you can scoot around in your very own, upgradable (which is kinda cool i guess) Power Armor! The other thing i feel is off with the Power Armor this time around is that it feels like a vehicle instead of armor. Why not just have it as its always been? Now it feels like an old crummy car you are taking to the mechanic for the fifth time this month. But then again, since you did not have to make an effort to get it in the first place, why should the reward feel significant? Sure, you can upgrade it, but you still have had the damn thing since the first hour, it's not special anymore!\n\nI listed combat under the positives but there is alot to be wanted here as well. Combat is the highlight for many people in this game it seems, but i don't see whats so great about it? Seeing as how this game is trying to be more of an FPS than a RPG, i'd expect alot more from the feel of combat. It's better than Fallout 3 and NW sure, but we lost so much other stuff from those games, and for what? Improved first person combat? It does not feel as tight and on point as it should if this is supposed to be an FPS, or even for an FPS/RPG hybrid.\n\nI guess it can be debated if this is an RPG or a FPS, but in my eyes, it's an FPS TRYING to be an RPG. So then i think we are allowed to expect alot more and judge it harder on that point.\n\nFinal Words\nAll in all i feel that Bethesda really lost sight of what Fallout is. It's a RPG first hand, and if you want to have first person combat, that comes second to the RPG elements. That is not the case with F4. They tried to make it into something it's not, and thats a shame seeing as how unique and awesome the Fallout universe is at its core. The whole game feels like a squandered opportunity.\n\nI am still going to play this game for a long time to come i believe, but that is only due to the fact that i am sure it is going to have an dedicated and amazing modding community keeping this game alive for years to come.\n\nIf i was to score the game, i guess maybe 3.5/10? Maybe 4/10. Not worth full price at the moment if you ask me. And i even got the season pass!\n\nOh boy...","November 12, 2015","false","46.0"," 280 of 478 people (59%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","59","280","478","9","3"

Bad PC interfaces and control issues are also something I've seen in Skyrim so that's all kinda okay to me. Shallow story and characters are also somewhat expected, but it is at least slightly better than Fallout 3.\n\nWhat I hate is that it does not feel like a RPG anymore. There is almost no choice in dialogue. You even cannot go back to your previous dialogue tree, and inquiry is even more limited than say, Mass Effect. It just feels like watching a cutscene. There is no skill and vey few perk-based choices.\n\nBethesda's RPG element was somewhat iffy in Fallout 3, but at least it let you to do some creative evil things and there were several memorable, fun quests like the Wasteland Survival Guide. Fallout 4, no, not anymore. You do the fetch quest, or you don't.\n\nEven exploration feels bland. There are very little interesting subquest or random events. Even two Vaults I've been to, which should be filled with wacky Vault-tec experiments, all felt quite bland.\n\nAll that left is open world fetching, shooting and looting. It's basically RAGE with Power Armors, Far Cry : Fallout or Borderlands the Nuclear Wasteland edition. As an open world shooter, it is a decent one as they improved gunplay and AI a lot - but not exceptional, and without RPG elements, Fallout 4 is simply a fun yet buggy and graphically dated FPS, nothing special.\n\nI've been a fan of Bethesda Softworks since Oblivion, and as someone who played Fallout 1, 2, 3, Tactics and New Vegas. I liked all of them, but I'm sad to say I do not like Fallout 4, and worried at where the Bethesda is going.\n\n\n\nEDIT : I wrote this review after playing for 25 hours. Now that I played more than 100 hours, discovered nearly all the locations and spent few hours building settlements, I still feel the same with the game. Overall it felt quite mediocre and sometimes I had to force my self to 'complete' the exploration, which I never thought possible in a Bethesda game.","November 11, 2015","false","112.7"," 51 of 77 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","51","77","0","0"

The enemy movements (i.e.) of the Feral Ghouls is quite the challenge when in large groups. The enemies such as humans & mutants takes cover and this adds to the realism of combat.\nWatch out for the kamikaze also....be very very careful in those small streets...\n\n>Graphics/Environement/Atmosphere\n-Graphics are great in my opinion even though there is alot of damn 2d textures for the foliages,tree's & etc... I dont really mind that the graphics are not on par with other AAA titles, they are incredible to me, i love the haze,the sun trying to peirce through it, the environement is just amazing to look at , the wasteland looks quite epic in my opinion.\n\n>Sprinting\n-Nuff said\n\n>Customization of Weapons and Armor\n-At first i didnt know if i would like that but to say the truth....\nI really like it , it's well done and love that i can make a more unique equipement for my character.\n\n-------\n\nThe Bad\n\n>Forced Backstory/lack of dialogue option\n-I'm forced into an entire backstory that i dont really enjoy, get all obsessed with finding my kid and suddenly have so much knowledge about the wasteland, the institute and super mutants... I dont get to choose what i want to do in most of my "choices" during dialogues, it's a real Russian roulette each time i press something because i have no clue what he will really say.\n\n>Main Storyline\n-The main story so far doesnt impress me that much. (will update later).\n\n>Character feels like he doesnt have any emotions...\n-Like literally doesnt seem to have emotions sometimes when he speaks , not only him but many npc's.Sometime the voice acting is good and okay but most of the time it's making me lose interest in the conversation. Also the conversations are pretty basic and feels like they have been ripped off from cheesy movies\n\n>Clueless NPC's with zero coordination...\n-I keep getting my follower to either stop in the doors ,  only sits down in chairs and couch WHEN IM LEAVING not while i'm trading or talking , they just roam around not knowing what the hell they should do with their lives. They also get in your line of sight all the time, guess they like lead.\nThe dog AI is also half-decent and half-stupid.\nSays he found something but stare at a wall in an empty house...\n\n>Limitation of 1 follower.\nCannot take Dogmeat + another follower...\nThat's just wrong.\nIn FNV you could take ED-E + another follower , or Rex and another follower.\n\n>Removal of Skills\n-WHY? JUST WHY BETHESDA!?!?!?!? THAT WASNT NECESSARY!\n\n(Keeping these 2 points i've made in my original review).\n\n>Get a Power Armor,Mini-gun, Face Raiders + a Deathclaw,Become an All-knowing Wasteland Superhero General that creates settlements in the blink of an eye in less than 2 hours in the game.\n\n>GET INVITED TO THE BROTHERHOOD LESS THAN 2 HOURS IN THE GAME...THE GUYS THAT NEVER ACCEPT ANYONE ALSO GIVES YOU ON THEIR MOST VALUABLE TECHNOLOGIES FOR FREE!\n\n----------\n\nWant my opinion ?\nThis game is good if you dont mind the storyline that breaked my heart as a fan of the serie.\nIf feel like Bethesda had a great opportunity in their hands but sadly didnt deliver what fans expected after playing F3 and FNV.\nSad considering the fact that we waited years for this.\nMaybe one day i'll see this game under a different eye , but right now i feel like they removed too much good stuff that was making the game original and added too much useless things such as a grindy settlement building mini-game. They could have kept that but us gathering the ressources and voting for a settlement leader that would lead the operation to make (i.e.) defferent types of settlements such as : Farming community , Trading Post , Fortress , etc...\n\nBut that is MY DARN OPINION stop disliking because your a Bethesda fan boy, i'm not a Obsidian fan boy but BOY DID THEY MAKE A DARN GOOD JOB ON FALLOUT NEW VEGAS.\nEH ? BETH? DONT WANT TO SPEAK ABOUT IT EH? THAT'S RIGHT , DONT ANWSER , WE KNOW YOUR GAME M8!\n\n--------\n\nTL;DR\n\nI doesnt feel like an original Fallout it feels like a mix of Doom , CoD and stamped a few Fallout images and theme over the place.","November 11, 2015","false","30.6"," 791 of 1,374 people (58%) found this review helpful 37 people found this review funny","58","791","1","37","25"

A character creator that doesn't maker everyone look the same.\n\nCons: Very shallow gameplay, poor dialogue with poor/if any choices, awful construction mode tacked on, complete lack of most things that make a Fallout game.\n\nFallout basics are either missing or completely mashed up and regurgitated to fit an action game, rather than an RPG game. This is a series known for it's freedom of choice, variety of options, diverse character skill development and a sense that you might be able to die any minute. Fallout 4 has none of that, if you want anything from Fallout 1&2, you are looking in the wrong place. If you want anything from FO3 or NV then you are going to have to accept that they have traded graphics and combat for any kind of depth and difficulty.\n\nI gave it a negative review to highlight that this is a terrible Fallout game, if Bethesda want a nice tight little FPS then that is fine...but don't tack that onto the Fallout series. I liked what FO3, and NV especially for what they were, but destroying the SPECIAL system, erasing skills and making the player the equivilent of a Terminator from the start just ruined any hope i had to bother finishing it.\n\nCertainly the biggest disappointment of 2015.","December 20, 2015","false","32.3"," 43 of 63 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","43","63","0","0"

In 2009 I was using a HD 3470 laptop, The graphic sucks, I can only get 20-30fps in Windowed mode with low-mid settings, and I only use V.A.T.S because the shooting part feels awful and inaccurate. But I still say it’s the best game in its genes. The plot went with your choices, nice little details in interaction, Karma and skill system, food / water and sleep actually means something.\n\nBut most importantly, it’s DIALOGUE, PLOT and EMOTION defined Fallout, they made you feel what’s like to be in a post-war wasteland, where characters have emotions and your choices can decide their life and death, and you realize that every life matters, or you can let the devil out and have no mercy, in a world where everyone for himself.\n\nI remember that after the first 30 minutes I found Metagon instead of the Mighty Power Armor\nI still remember Tenpenny Tower, they let ghouls in - I persuaded them, when I returned, no one lives, ghouls rules\nI remember that girl named Cherry, I put 1000 caps into her pocket in stealth mode, hoping she may choose a better life, found her died outside Rivet City, guess old habits die hard\nRemember Dead Money in FONV, God and Dog\nand Lonesome Road, one of the best plots I've seen in RPG games\n\nBut FO4, Yes, No, Maybe, Sarcastic?\nPre-defined character and plot, shallow, meaningless quests and dialogues, NPCs are just cold plastic models like those in the museum. Most times they don't have a life. They don't concern life and death.\n\nNo more surprise moments when you access a terminal and find a novel-like story – Mostly they only have obvious clues for items. Also, the moments when you find something rare when looting.\n\nNo more Karma system.\n\nMaybe they should remove all the dialogue, perk and other RPG elements, just focus on the shooting part, they could even get rid of the 'annoying' health bar and stimpak, mix it with the new crafting system, turn it into a great Wasteland FPS game! 'Call of Falloutcraft' ! Maybe it'll be better, since in that case I won't wait for this game for years and finally waste my money.\n\nGuess I don't need to describe those good old days. From Battlefield Hardline to Call of Duty BO3, Assassin's Creed Unity, then Arkham Knight, you already knew those days are long gone.\n\nEnd of an Era.\n\nUNLIMITED / 10\nThanks to all these games. it’s time to shift my focus to real life.","November 13, 2015","false","30.7"," 206 of 349 people (59%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","59","206","349","7","0"

Are you serious, Bethesda? 10% of the population is left-handed, and I'd guess roughly half of those people keybind their movement/general-use keys to the number pad. You're ok with alienating 5% of your audience, making the game virtually unplayable unless you unlearn X amount of years of playing PC games a certain way? Again, this is 2015. I have a $60 piece of digital trash for an X amount of weeks or months until a modder is able to fix this idiotic bind lock problem. You have to be the only major gaming company to consistantly pull this crap.\n\nSo, this is somewhat unplayable unless I switch to a weird and uncomfortable right-handed setup that makes me feel like I'm playing my first PC game ever. Auto downvote. Listen, Beth... entire consoles have been derided by fans/critics for ridiculously unfamiliar or unintuitive controller layouts. This isn't an immersion-breaking bug that you can get past and continue, or a penchant for the game to have to be installed a couple times to work right, or an NPC flying around in a certain zone; every action and movement I'd make would be made not fun by a bad key layout, start to finish.

Considering Bethesda is known as Bugthesda.\n+Good atmosphere.\n+Crafting is fun and complex\n+The music is top notch. I liked that they included Edvard Grieg in there.\n\n-Story is uninteresting and feels like Bethesda did not prioritize it as much as they should have.\n-The dialogue options are pathetic, and a huge step down from previous fallout games.\n-Companions are more annoying than helpsome. Especially Dogmeat. He will block your way on small corridors very often, and he aggroes enemies when you try to sneak past them. They are only useful if you go full rambo, because apparantly Dogmeat can tank sh*t tons of damage, and still be alive. Go figure.\n-The hud is ugly.

Not this time. I can't give you the thumbs up.\n\nFor those of you who are interested in a game with a simpified skill tree, little character customization and a mass-effect styled walk around the globe and do cool stuff game then this is definitely the game for you. It runs smooth enough and with mods can provide some very nice customization, though in its current state isn't very good for what it tries to achieve.\n\nThe system -\n\nFallout 4 uses a tech tree style similar to Wolfenstein New Order (EDIT: I was wrong about Bethesda's involvement. It was my assumption from the loading screen of Wolfenstein that Bethesda was involved more heavily. I should have done more research, my bad. Understand as a lifelong fan of Fallout, from the very first DND-type games to New Vegas, I loved this series. To see it die infront of me had me ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ like a king.) in which you spend your points on perks and unlocks rather than leveling up skills. There are no skills in the game as far as I can tell, you level up lockpicking 4 times and you get master/unbreakable (Which is only available at lvl 40 anyway, good luck with that.). You level up your science you can modify energy guns, but not make them. There's only a few energy/plasma weapons in the game anyway because they're all customizable but in a very small range of play.\n\nArmor crafting is even worse. They use a modular system, IE you can put on specific limbs, but it doesn't work with all clothing so if you want to wear a labcoat and a raider arm you can't. Have to use a harness or one of the modular pieces. So modular but not modular armor. You can upgrade your clothes and armor as well, unless it's anything but the vault suit, which can be given a lining upgrade much like the guns can get damage upgrades but you can't do this on labcoats or other items which usually count as clothes. Suppose that much is fair but for a game that prides item customization, it's lacking.\n\nAs far as buildings/settlements goes it's mediocre. Looks like a mod still in alpha. There's limited options, half the pieces in settlements don't have snap points and basically ARK did it better.\n\nDialogues are by far the most abysmal thing I've ever seen. If I wanted to play mass effect I'd go to Origin. Four options, your character talks. Now this might not be a big deal for some of you players but for people who enjoy a roleplaying game it's pretty unimmersive. The story is too complex for you to make your own adventure, the character you play has a preset route he has to go through and you merely choose the way he goes about it. In that sense it's sort of semi-linear but for me a deal breaker of the highest kind. In skyrim your options were very diverse, you could say and do a multitude of crazy things and due to the way the story was set up, you could imagine your character to be of any background and any way. Here, your dude ♥♥♥♥♥es every 7 seconds about his military life and dead wife. It's not your character, it's bethesda's original OC do not steel. Sure you can melt his face but if you have no idea how to sculpt then you'll likely fail, and with no numbers or sliders you can't do specific tweaks.\n\nMoving onto that, the face sculpter is an interesting idea but it's difficult to master. It's somewhat intuitive, has a few options and the triangular body slider isn't that bad of an addition but without the numbers you're at a disadvantage if you want something specific. It's more of a personal preference, but for those who enjoy making characters with defined features, saving presets and other such race-menu esque details, it's nigh impossible. A sidenote: Bethesda likes to limit your options by making you find comic books in the world to unlock hair styles and tattoos/scars for future playthroughs. While it's a good idea in theory, it ends up leaving you with only 20 hairstyles to start, though it's really not a big deal due to the barber only costing 15 caps.\n\nDespite everything I know and love being ripped from the corpse of the game and simplified to a point where nothing matters, there are some significant improvements. For instance, your companions can dislike and like actions. If you steal infront of Codsworth, he gets salty about it and will even sometimes reprimand you for your choices. The charisma options are interesting as well, you don't have a flat fail rate you have a dice instead. If you convince someone, the difficulty of convincing them is shown in a gradiant of yellow to orange in the text of the ONE OF FOUR OPTIONS AAAA--\n\nSorry. It's just very disappointing. I suppose my summary for this game, and I might add on more to this review later, is go play Mass Effect, atleast the PC version wasn't a console port.\n\nEdit: The thing that makes this game the worst, is it is SO different from past versions and the successful godsend Obsidian made that there's going to be too much work for modders to do. They're going to have to tear this FPS apart at the core to make it like it was. We were promised a roleplaying game, something where we can design our own characters and have broader choices. What we got was a 3 dimensional railroad.","November 10, 2015","false","70.0"," 1,733 of 3,030 people (57%) found this review helpful 67 people found this review funny","57","733","3","67","46"

With the exception of Indie gaming it seems that mainstream titles are over simplifying features and streamlining what made them original in the first place.\n\nFallout 4 is a perfect example of cutting back on features so it can appeal to a wider audience instead of taking the mantle of it's origins and extending them further.\n\nLet's run a quick check list..\n\n- Skills points removed, replaced by perks.\n- Any survival mechanics introduced in New Vegas scrapped.\n- Dialog has been cut back.\n- Removal of Karma system (Seriously, hardly any repercussions).\n\nJust a few off the top of my head anyway. So am i saying Fallout 4 is a bad game? Hell no, i enjoy certain aspects of it despite a lot of things upsetting me. Honestly Skyrim to me felt like where the whole feature stripping started when you compare it to Oblivion and when compared to Fallout 3, Fallout 4 feels the same.\n\nConsidering we have now entered the next generation of Hardware i was expecting more from every aspect of the game not just the features that have been lost in time. Fallout 4 had the chance to be revolutionary, not just in a gameplay perspective but the very foundation of it's systems aswell.\n\nSo in summary, do i recommend Fallout 4? In time yes i will, modders will take Bethesda's work and turn it into something more...but for now i would have to say that i am left a little disappointed.","November 10, 2015","false","19.1"," 175 of 295 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","175","295","3","8"

Maybe they should apply the companion hitbox to the floors and walls.\n\nThe story is a pathetic and clichéd "I must rescue my son, where is my son" story, that's weirdly paced, and your character's motivations don't really match your possible actions actions;  you either join Father and help the Institute hide away forever with their robots, or you blow up the Institute. The entire game tells you that the Institute is some sort of bogeyman kidnapping people in the night, but it never actually happens to anyone in the game. This is poor writing, just telling and not showing.\n\nThe game auto-detects controllers and disables mouse and keyboard input while it's plugged in, which really adds to the feel of it's a bad console port, and the controls are weirdly designed i.e. melee/throw grenade/hold breath are the same key, and you can't separate them into different key-binds, leading to many awkward grenade throws after sniping, or throwing a grenade when you wanted to melee someone up close.\n\nSkills have been change from a levelling up due to use to a more washed out, and casual, perk based skill system. Instead of using a skill to get better at it, every time you level up you just pick a skill to level up with you.\n\nPeople are just becoming complacent with Bethesda producing the same low quality game, that cuts more and more corners with every iteration of their games, removing multiple features but adding a shiny new one to distract everyone from what was removed. Removing things like:\n-survival difficulty, where you need to drink, eat and seek doctors to fix damaged limbs.\n-waiting, something you use to change the time of day to a more favourable time to attack, to just limiting it only when you're seated in a chair.\n-multiple conversation choices, to be limited to just 4 possible choices, hardly able to get information out of characters when you can only have 4 questions.\n\n\nPeople have come to expect to fall through the floor in a Bethesda game and no longer even see that as a problem; but it is, it always was.\n\nThe game runs, looks, feels and plays like it was made half-♥♥♥♥♥ in a month using the majority of Fallout 3's code, improving upon nothing but adding in the base building gimmick that was originally just a mod. It plays as a shooter and has barely anything that you could consider classifying as an RPG, other than RPG isn't a properly defined genre and any game could be called one.","November 11, 2015","false","26.5"," 486 of 841 people (58%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","58","486","841","30","4"

It's completely true that some peple will find more enjoyment out of this game than others. If you were a fan of Skyrim or hell, even Borderlands you might enjoy this game more than I did. And I don't hate it! That red thumb means very little, I just think some questionable compromises were made here that I'd like to address. This review will mostly contain lists of positives and negatives I've experienced in my 15 hours of gameplay. It may contain minor spoilers story wise.\n\nPositives\n+ The environments and textures, despite how they run, do look very pretty. I play the game on high settings (what it defaulted me to) and the world still looks great all around.\n+ The ambient tracks in particular are very pleasant. This game gets a lot of the sound aspects done right, and I would even suggest turning off the radio and just listening to the ambient tracks that really do bring you back to the good old fallout days.\n+ Gunplay is fun and they really seemed to step up customization overall in terms of weapons, in what results in a more unique experience for every player. I was never one for weapon mods in Fallout myself (cost too damn much), but to say it's not a positive would be a lie.\n+ Checking supplies in drawers, cabinets, and the like doesn't require you going into every one individually, which is a great new feature that really removes the tediousness behind it. It even sorts these items in terms of aid, bottlecaps, guns, apparel, etc.. It has its drawbacks as well, but that's for the negatives.\n+ Sprinting is a cool feature. I had a mod installed in New Vegas that worked exactly the same way, and it's cool to know that Bethesda can learn from modders about neat features.\n\nOkay\n= Building settlements is an odd feature to put in a fallout game, and it's not very intuitive. From the very first trailer showing this feature off I knew for a fact I would not care to mess with any of it, because to me that's not playing Fallout. Consider this point a personal opinion, as I'm sure thousands of people will get many hours out of customizing their settlements. Not for me.\n= Companions are walking tanks, some more than others of course. I believe Bethesda tried to make companions balanced with their own strengths and weaknesses, such that Dogmeat can sniff out items (thanks for the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ pipe pistol Dogmeat, would've hated to miss that) but dies when touching a fly, and Danse literally never dies even when I send him into a horde of 4 super mutants. When a mutant suicider can go full terrorist on Danse and he can shake it off and continue fighting, that's a problem.\n= Some decent characters. While I'm only about 15 hours in as of writing this review, I would say the only truly interesting character interactions have been in Diamond City. Everyone else has been rather cookie cutter good or bad guy. But, as stated before, if you came to Bethesda expecting quality writing you'd be better to look elsewhere (cough obsidian)\n= The weather conditions seem cool as an idea, but overall don't cause much of a threat to your player. Radiation storms give you 1 radiation every 10 seconds, and can be slept away in a single hour. Neat idea, strange execution.\n\nMediocre\n- This is a role playing game, or at least it's supposed to be. That usually means I get to choose my role and shape my character to my liking. Let's look at Fallout New Vegas for example. We have minimum setup for your character, all we know is that he was a character who got shot in the head and was a courier once. Not only does this give us very little information about the person and allow us to then take the role, but getting shot in the head is a great excuse to start building a character that's all you, regardless of their past. Who cares who you were in the past, that part of your brain could've been blown out for all I care. In Fallout 4, Bethesda would rather choose your character for you, make you a loving husband/wife that spouts lovey dovey quips at their significant other, and give you a baby that you're supposed to care about despite having no actual connection to it. Fallout 3 also had this problem, though not as bad, and I'm baffled that Bethesda continues to take away from the player experience like this. And after New Vegas handled it so well, it's weird to see that Bethesda still went with this path.\n-The new dialogue tree aspect it detrimental and boring. I would much sooner have no voice acting in my character than have only 4 options for any given situation. Also, skill checks are ambiguous. Sometimes I fail them, sometimes not, who the ♥♥♥♥ knows. I'm still not sure of what color means what in regards to levels. I've often times said the wrong thing since the summary of what I'm going to say doesn't reflect my words. But hey, you can be the most sarcastic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ around if you want?\n- I've not been spoiled on the end and no nothing about where the story is going, but if Shaun is the evil leader of the institute in the game I'm giving it a 1/10 story. I'm sorry if this is actually spoilers, but that's what seems to be likely right now. Needless to say I'm not expecting much either way.\n- The stat point allocation is taken away and adding points to S.P.E.C.I.A.L. is now possible whenever the hell you want. This baffles me to no end why this decision was made, did we really decide that putting points to actual stats was too complicated? And if that wasn't the case, how does this new sustem somehow improve this? Not to mention perks were more useful and exciting when you got them in addition to stat points. Overall, this makes leveling feel very lackluster and is, again, a baffling thing to change. I'd love to ask the developers why they did it.\n- So far at this point in the story, I've fought 80% raiders, ghouls, and mutants. The other 10 percent being synths. Many of the areas characters send you to contain these specific enemy types only. There is very little that is interesting behind fighting any of these enemies, which only adds to the combat being overall disappointing.\n- No way to check stats on items before picking them up. I mentioned before that checking items without having to physically open every cabinet is great, but the problem here is that I have no idea whether that piece of armor with 500 adjectives in front of it is better than what I'd currently wearing, or that a gun with some random mods has more value than my other gun with random mods. I could be wrong about this, and there might actually be a button to quickly check, but I haven't found it.\n- The game runs poorly at certain areas (I'm looking at you, everywhere that's not inside a building) and the UI is poor. I've consistently gotten less than 30 FPS wandering the wasteland and frankly that's a damn shame. The UI for building and favorites and the like is obviously build for a console/controller experience that it's pretty much worthless trying to navigate on PC.\n- An annoying bug I thought I'd make a point about, we didn't need animations walking up to terminals. I've been stuck twice now because my worthless dog stood in the way. If I didn't have a save from 30 seconds ago, I'd be damn ♥♥♥♥♥♥. As is right now, the game is worth waiting on just for bugs alone.\n\nOverall this game has been an alright experience. A lot of my time has been spent wandering and not following the story, which is common to do in open world Bethesda games. I think if you enjoyed Fallout 3 and Skyrim, you'd enjoy this game too. As someone who comes to this game looking for a uniquely Fallout experience, this game doesn't deliver exceptionally well, and the review score reflects that. I think at 60 dollars this game is not worth getting, a sale would be a more approprite time.\n\nI'll try to talk about stuff in the comments, cause word limits.","November 12, 2015","false","47.4"," 720 of 1,252 people (58%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","58","720","1","27","16"

By all means, if the game looks interesting to you, then pick it up, you'll get a lot of hours of enjoyment out of it, but viewed in the context of the series as a whole it's a disappointment.\n\nPros:\n+It's more Fallout, we've been itching for a new game for a long time, and it's still a 3D Fallout game at heart.\n+Gunplay is much improved over Bethesda's embarrassing shooting in Fallout 3, bringing it right about on par (in my opinion) with a modded Fallout New Vegas.\n+VATS feels a little bit more useful, there's a lot of fast-moving enemies that make Vats a great asset for picking out targets.  It doesn't totally pause the game now, it slows down time to a near standstill, giving you a bit more of a sense of urgency when you're making decisions mid-combat.\n+You can sprint now.  This is kind of a joke of a pro, it was dumb (in my opinion) that you couldn't without mods before anyway.\n\nCons:\n-Poor optimization.  You'll get frame drops in the weirdest of places--interiors frequently run more poorly for me than interiors.  There's a weird black screen that gets thrown up when you try to look down a magnifying scope.\n-Inconsistent lip syncing.  Sometimes it seems like mouth movements and audio are off by half a second, sometimes they're exactly right.\n-Characters wander away mid-conversation.  (Frustrated fuming)\n-What does "Sarcastic" mean?  I know what "yes" means, I know what "no" means, but "sarcastic" tells me nothing!  Sarcastic refusal?  Sarcastic aceptance?  Sarcastic agreement?  Random witty phrase?\n-If you saw screenshots of the dialogue choices and thought "bad mass effect rip off," your instincts are good.  There is no role playing choice in this system, you at best can either say yes or no, with a sarcasm option that is kind of a toss up from the couple times I've tried it.  "Important" missions you may find will probably take away the "no" option, and just give you varying degrees of "yes."  Dialogue with companions seems to give you more options for how to respond, but they of course have little impact on the world at large and how you're allowed to respond to it.  There used to be a lot of interesting speech checks that were based on your characters actual proficiencies: speech, barter, guns, science, medical, etc.  Now there just seems to be a basic "persuade" option, with difficulty indicated by a resoundingly unhelpful color coding system.  This is really disappointing for someone who really enjoyed the dialogue system in the previous Fallouts.\nThe thing is, I like Mass Effect's dialogue system.  I had a bit of a problem with the dialgoue choices in that game being so polarized between messianic and puppy-kickingly evil, but it worked well enough for that franchise.  But Fallout isn't Mass Effect.  Fallout already had something that worked really well for it, and they scrapped it for a soulless rip off of a system.\n-A lot of people cite the small world map as a con, but for me, the problem lies with the world design rather than the raw size of the map.  Bethesda crams a lot of ruined cities and derelict structures into that tiny map, but a feeling I got really strongly as I played was "look, but don't touch."  The ruined cities are visually great, finely detailed masterpieces, but when you're actually walking through them, it feels underwhelming.  Point to a building in a town, and there's a 50% or more chance you won't be able to go into it.  Concord, the first city I visited on my adventure, had like three or four explorable buildings in a fairly sizeable town.  It got dishearting as I explored, trying to see everything, running up to a building that looked interesting and realizing it was inexplicably boarded up.  Repeating that process over and over and over was incredibly disappointing for me.\nI keep thinking back to New Vegas, and Primm, one of the earlier towns you can visit.  Primm is pretty unexciting, really, it's just a few buildings on the side of the road  in the desert, the most significant being the old hotel/casino taken over by powder gangers.  But like Concord, it has a few buildings to explore and one bigger dungeon-esque building with enemies inside.  Concord is a bigger town, but most of it ends up being non-interactible visual fluff, whereas Prim actually utilizes most of the structures in the town.  When New Vegas boarded up buildings (and oh boy, it did, and don't even get me started on how disappointing the titular New Vegas itself was), I was able to forgive it because it more than made up for it in the scope of the exterior map, and it's no secret that it was a rushed, overly ambitious project that we're lucky turned out as well as it did.  But I had hoped that Bethesda, with all the mainstream success they've had with the Elder Scrolls, and all the modern hardware they could take advantage of, would push the envelope of the interactive environment, and give us an interactive environment on a scale we hadn't seen before.","November 12, 2015","false","29.9"," 766 of 1,334 people (57%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","57","766","1","23","17"

Much of the time you were never quite sure what your character was going to say (yes i know there's a mod for this...no I'm not installing mods to fix dev issues).\n\nThe buidling/crafting system was god-awful. It could have been good or at least manageable, but it's control implementation made you want to punch a kitten after about 5 min. This could have been easily resolved by using a standard top-down generic interface.\n\nAlso in my game, the mayor of diamond city.....was never there. There's supposed to be a mayor and a whole story line there. But....no. His secretary was there. His guard ws there. He was never there. (Yes I checked the entire city)\n\nI could nit-pick many other things that kinda ruined it for me but I'd rather just get to the big one...\n\n\nThe game has basically 4 factions. These being the Railroad, The institute, The Brotherhood and The Minutemen.\n\nAt some point in the game, you make a choice to follow one of these factions to the end.\n\n\nMy game never gave me that option(s). Due to....reasons?!?\n\nThe only faction I could get to progress to the end was the Brotherhood. With the other factions, their quests just stopped.\n\nThis angered me greatly since I had no intention of going with the Brotherhood. This bug/issue alone is enough to get it a thumbs down.

You get companions as soon as you start the game, and come on, who did not see that ending coming.\nDialogue is bland, and don't even mention the countless times you didn't even mean what your character says.\nPower armor is supposed to be the final frontier, when you've done everything, mastered the combat, learned how to play the game.

It feels like they were trying to mix Rust or some other open world building game with Fallout, and it leaves you with a pretty bland looking world where every town no longer feels like a discovery, but more like an overly-safe zone which you can completely destroy and rebuild after doing one simple quest.\n\nSure you don't have to do that, but it really does take away the magic of finding a new settlement, since they now all feel the same.\n\nDialogues are really nice and dynamic, you no longer get locked into them and you can have dialogues while the world around you is still unpaused, even pulling a gun on the person you're talking to.\nHowever, they also feel more forced and useless.\n\nI can't entirely explain what's wrong with this game but it just feels so flat and empty.\n\nCombat is nice but almost every gun you pick up will be a slightly different version than your previous one, since you'll mostly be spending time digging through your collection of pipe pistols only to figure out they're all equally ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThis is because every gun is customisable. This is obviously a great addition, but this just means you'll be making minor changes to afterwards still average guns, instead of creating entirely new weapons to your liking. They could have added more items to change the behaviours of the guns to be mixed up by the player.\nAlso whenever you have your gun holstered, it's invisble.\nOne of the simplest, but coolest cosmetic things in fallout was that you had your gun in your holster or on your back. Now you just reach for thin air next to you and *poof*- there's your weapon.\nThis too takes away the immersion and character of the game.\n\nAfter just about every quest you'll be spending time fast traveling back and forth to get all the loot back to your base.\nThis is a tedious process that is the result of the whole "everything is useful now" concept.\nThe concept is nice, but they could at least have added in some items like backpacks to actually make it fun in the game.\n\nI've only cleared about 2/10 of the map at best and i already lost all appetite to continue exploring, which hasn't been the case in the previous fallout games for me.\n\n\n\nTL:DR\nNot a bad game, but although there's probably days of replayability in it, there's no motive to keep playing.

So I can't discover ♥♥♥♥ about the city because dialogue no longer exists unless it's linked to a questline.\n\nDon't get me wrong, there are still alot of quests, but I feel like I'm in a lifeless world. I no longer have any real sense of immersion because my character is so forcefully from the past. I can't enter a questline without bringing up my lost son or dead wife and being frozen in a cryotube chamber for a hundred years. This completely ruins the replay value as instead of like in past fallouts being about to take several different paths, I'm stuck on the same, linear path. Dialogue doesn't even matter, what I say doesn't matter at all, I could be a total ♥♥♥♥♥♥ to someone or I could be nice and it won't change anything except them reacting in a minorly different manner, but ultimately making no effect what so ever.\n\nThis game was ruined by its desperate attempt to appeal to it's new playerbase that has to have constant action and simple quests(kill these, fetch this). You are forced into combat so frequently that it's not even satisfying to take out a band of raiders because you're literally encountering a new band of raiders every 5 minutes of travel. Literally 30 seconds outside every single friendly village/city in no matter what direction you go there will be some raider, super mutant or some annoying molerat group you encounter and have to slaughter. You are a one man army who will kill atleast 100 people in your first 4 hours of gameplay.\n\nQuests have been deluded into for the most part being "go kill this band of raiders/super mutants/ghouls/mutated animals as they've been harassing us", the main questline is a little more in depth than that, but not by much. This feels like a slightly advanced farcry 3 and despite both farcry and fallout 4 being good games, this is nothing like past fallouts and has completely taken the power and creativity away from the player.","November 11, 2015","false","58.3"," 47 of 71 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","47","71","2","0"

Here's the bottom line. Unless you are a major fan of the franchise, I can't recommend buying at this time. I'm hoping that Bethesda will take responsibility and fix their product, but... You know what they say. Hope into one hand, ♥♥♥♥ into the other, and see which one fills up first. If you're on the fence, give it around 3-6 months and wait for a sale.\nI mean... It says something, when the best Fallout games we've gotten in over the last ten years have been Obsidian's Fallout: New Vegas and Wasteland 2.\n\nPros:\n-The game's graphical update is quite welcome, especially with all the colors.\n-The settlement system is a cool idea.\n-Animations on some enemies (e.g. The way Feral Ghouls flail about, Mirelurks turtle up and charge, etc.) is phenomenal.\n-Running (or, sneaking) around, exploring places and looting things is reasonably enjoyable.\n-The additional weapon variety and the crafting to be able to reforge the weapon you've been using into an entirely different role is great.\n-The fact that there are populated vaults with something that's capable of talking rather than shooting is nice.\n-Your companions will converse with nearby  NPCs, which is a welcome touch.\n-The game doesn't restrict you from being polyamorous, if you choose to do so.\n\nThat's about all I can think of, in terms of positives. Everything else....where to start.\n-What's with the story? I'd accuse it of copying Fo3, but... At least, in Fo3, the father had interesting motivations and was working on harnessing fascinating technologies that would affect the entire wasteland. Here, it's essentially a cutscene that says "here's this person you love that's now dead, here's this other person you love that's now kidnapped, fond slap on the bum, go get 'em tiger".\n-The usefulness of ALL items seems great on paper, but it absolutely tanks the pacing, as you inevitably end up spending hours ferrying around endless amounts of trash.\n-The game doesn't explain ANYTHING. Which, I wouldn't be an issue, except for how there's a bunch of things implemented in odd ways. For example, there are been functions I learned about only after being told about them by friends. Functions like getting out of your power armor without waiting for the battery to fully drain.\n-The traits menu is pretty, but inefficient at communicating information. I prefer the older text interface.\n-The PC port is straight-up horrid. Why does leaving the framerate unlocked ♥♥♥♥ with the physics and game speed? Why do are certain functions perma-bound to certain keys? Why does the melee attack and grenade have to share a button? Why are some functions using multiple buttons, but are not usable interchanably? Why are the loading times absolutely abysmal? Why does the game feel like it hasn't been even remotely optimized?\n-The AI....oh, man. NPCs taking cover seems great...except, they always leave a large portion of their body exposed. Also, companions are often worse than useless. The number of times my super sneaky character was discovered because a companion would refuse to get out of the open, or would pull everyone by charging into combat as I'm trying to sneak away, or would block my path of escape from a grenade at my feet...AGH.\n-One would think that converting a classically silent protagonist into a voiced one would have entailed doing a quality job...apparently not.\n-Whatever happened to the whole "role playing" aspect of Fallout? Remember how in the older Fallout games, you could be Sir Benevolent the 3rd or Lord Mc♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ the 5th? Here, we'll have none of that lip. You're a good guy locked into the role of being a good guy, fighting for whatever has been pre-determined as being the "good guys". About the most evil thing you can possibly do is request more caps from the NPCs as quest reward....and, even then there are absolutely no consequences, so you have no reason to not do it.\n-The conversation system is atrocious. Not only do you have less agency in your decisions than you have in a TellTale game, the game steps on the same rake as Heavy Rain by having one word, vague descriptions that are generally very misleading to what your character actually will say. I suppose, at least, this...thing saved Bethesda a ton of cash (by limiting the dialogue options) after they made the incredibly misguided decision to voice act everything.\n-I understand that the karma system from before had its issues, but... The replacement is an utterly useless irritation.\n-The settlement interface was built for three-handed mutants. Not only that, Good luck with getting things to line up nicely or not float in mid-air. Also, terrain detection seems to work sparingly, at best (e.g. I've tried planting a melon on a surface, where sometimes the same patch of ground will show that you can, but sometimes, can't plant it).\n-The bugs, oh the bugs. I know that the community is going to help out with most of this, but... I think it's an abhorrent practice to have a AAA publisher release a full price title and then outsource the QA to the community. Here are some of my favorite examples:\n~Picking a lock, hacking a terminal, checking your PipBoy, or switching weapons has a chance to make it go invisible, leaving you stuck.\n~Taking back power armor that was stolen from you leaves it marked as stolen.\n~If you die during dialogue, the subtitles will remain on screen and the clip that played during your character's death will continue to play at random intervals.\n~Some walls are only solid and present to you. The number of times I've been shot by bandits through a solid brick wall...ugh.\n~Floodlights tend to regularly break, nuking the framerate and leaving a massive white void.","November 29, 2015","false","117.5"," 614 of 1,071 people (57%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","57","614","1","34","17"

Players just stop being able to move for no reason, the game just freezes.\n\nIts a console port so the menu controls are clunky unless you use a controller, and that should not be the case for a game that costs this much.\n\nWhen controlling your companions you have to use the mouse or the short command whit the arrow keys.... Yes, the arrowkeys. Even if you play whit WASD you have to let go of your mouse or stop moving and put your hand on the arrowkeys this makes it very hard to do in a combat situation.\n\nYou also have to confirm whit the Enter key in some cases. Why can't we just have something further away....\n\nBut the port problems are the worst. You can really feel the that this game is not mouse and keyboard friendly to play.\n\nBut I guess they count on the moders to keep it alive on PC.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoodGameHunter/recommended/377160/","GoodGameHunter","NightLurk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GoodGameHunter/","165 products in account","Lots of buthurt kiddies bashing the game cause that's the social trend and they need to be in line with the cool kids... Many whiners complaining that "this isn't a fallout game" because they heard it from someone else, like they're the ones who define what a fallout game is...\n\nIt's not the players who define what a product is, it's the creator of the product, as a customer you can either buy the product or gtfo, especially now that Steam offers refunds. Playing a game for 60, 90, 100, 400 hours and then giving it a negative review means you're simply a ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I think if you dislike a game you don't need 60 hours to figure it out.\n\nDO NOT BUY INTO THE STEAM REVIEW KIDDIES, go follow a playthrough on youtube, there are tons of them, that should be more than enough to get you to figure out if you want to buy the game or not. As for the game...\n\nSo why am I writing a pissy review? Well, because unlike steam review kiddies, I was playing Fallout 1 back in my highschool winter vacation of December 1997, I was playing Fallout 2 the year after, I was playing Fallout Tactics 3 years later, and every single one of all Fallouts ever made with the exception of everyone knows what console shame. So, if there's anyone who SHOULD talk about how the game "is not a fallout game" it would be the likes of me, who literally lived through the franchise. But, I'm NOT doing it. Because unlike review kiddies I have a mind of my own and I don't jump on the "trend train" to be inline with the social sheep herd.\n\nThings CHANGE over time, gaming becomes an industry, gamers become lamers, the Internet becomes a social cesspool... trust me I KNOW, that things change. Obviously this affects games too, especially over a period of two decades and between different companies. So...\n\nIs F4 a different game? YES, obviously, that's the whole point of evolution, CHANGE! If you want the same game then you shouldn't be buying the next iteration of the series, just play the old one! Is it "dumbed down"? OFC it is, have you seen ANY game in the last decade that was NOT dumbed down? OFC it's dumbed down, to applease the masses, to applease the steam review kiddies, to get inline with the trendies, to do all these things that need to be done so that the programmers, designers and artists working on the damn game for years can be paid and hopefuly also make a profit on it for the stockholders.\n\nThat's the way the world works, you bust your nuts to create a product, but if your product doesn't sell, you end up with a bunch of busted nuts AND no money. So you need to sell it, but in order to do that you need a marketing team, and then the marketing team runs market studies and checks the trends and do all the sadly necessary crap they do, and come up with a plan to maximize the potential revenue. So then the developers have to reach a compromise between their work, ideas, and desires and what the marketing department thinks, because if they don't they WILL end up earning less on the game than they spent on making it, which leads to bankruptcy which leads to NO MORE GAME!\n\nSo IS F4 different? Yes. Is it dumbed down? Yes. Is it less RPG-istic? Slightly. Is it a bad game? NO. Is it fun to play? Yes. Is it immersive? Very. Is it interesting? Yes. Does it have a good story? Yes. Does it bring innovating changes? Yes, plenty. Could it have been more polished and done better and have more content and more stuff and yada yada? Yes, and I would also like to be a billionaire and fly spaceships and have my vacations on Mars but there's such a thing called being a realist getting in my way... And we can go on and on like this, but it ultimately boils down to one thing...\n\nIs it worth the money? Well I'm not gonna answer that for you, instead just scroll through the tons of negative copy-paste reviews left by the review kiddies here, and check out their amount of played hours, and you draw your own conclusion if it's worth the money or not...

Modding weapons and building structures isn't enough to make this game feel fresh and feel like it was worth the wait.  The game is missing a connection between the player and the environment, i can't explain it but something just doesn't work.  Fallout 4 just feels like a new skin on an old body.  The combat feels dated, the story is forced and feels rushed.  Fallout 3 was going to be hard to equal and this game doesn't come close to matching the atmosphere, excitment and wonder.  Fallout 4 is by no menas a bad game, it just hasn't added anything to take the genre into a new era.  There was an opportunity missed here.\n\nAdmendment -\n\nAfter sinking a few more hours into the game, my mind hasn't changed at all.  I would put Fallout 3 in the top 10 games of all time and Fallout 4 in the top 100.  There are only a few new enemy types, which is lazy design, the AI has improved which is a plus.  The game feels like it is still using the Fallout 3 code, it doesn't feel like a huge improvement.  The few vaults i have come across don't have the same atmosphere of fear of excitment, they are very bland and polished.\n\nCompanions keep getting in the way, either in combat or they block doorways.  I haven't bothered to build any structures, some people will love that side of the game and sink hours into it, but they missed a major part of game development here.  They could have made a mini area control game, with numerous factions pushing for major controll.  The controlling of areas would be a constant push and pull.  You could get one settlement to produce water, food etc, which you could access or even sell.  The structure building part of the game feels unfinished in its current incarnation.\n\nThe weapon modding is a nice bit of fluff, but the fact you have to sink skill points into specific areas just to mod a baseball bat or a gun doesn't return on the amount of time you have to sink into the whole process (the collecting of specific items and skills)\n\nOn the plus side, the load times are very good, quite a few bugs, dog meat gets stuck in walls, as do enemys, and the game crashes every so often when i access the map on the pip boy.","November 10, 2015","false","132.4"," 398 of 691 people (58%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","58","398","691","14","8"

Couldn't get past 2 hour mark.\n\n-Fun combat\n-Boring story (for 2 hours)\n-Complicated interface\n-Annoying characters\n-Wouldn't let me kill "important" characters.\n-Found myself more annoyed than having fun\n-Dialogue was cheesy\n-Characters reacted unrealistically to situations and the environment around. I was unable to get involved in the story as a result.\n\n***Incoming rant with possible spoilers***\nFor instance, a nuke goes off killing thousands if not millions, and our main character and the characters around him barely escape death. No one is screaming, shouting, cursing, or freaking out. Then I have to listen to some vault tech personnel calmly tell me what to do and where to go like this ♥♥♥♥ happens all the time and it's just another Tuesday for him. Then some guy manages to break into my vault for the sole purpose of stealing my baby, and then shooting my wife. Disregard that all the doors are locked and sealed. This is no ordinary vault either. This is a military grade vault specifically designed to keep out radiation, that requires a big machine just to let me unlock the door so I can go outside.\n\nI decided to drudge on anyway with the intro, and multiple times I almost uninstalled. I follow the story to go to my house and I have to talk to that stupid robot. It was the most infurating experience having to converse with that pile of junk. I questioned why I was still playing at this point but figured perhaps the exploration and combat may redeem the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game I've experienced so far. Despite not being able to get into the story, I made my way into an encounter with raiders and the minutemen in a nearby town. I got into a shootout and took out most of the raiders. I preferred to attack manually, but used the "Q" targetting system which was kinda cool. After defeating the raiders, I talked to the main guy of the minutemen who I have a brief conversation with. I just saved his life and all his peoples lives, and I'm ready to move on but he starts demanding I continue to help him like I owe him something. It was after that point when I became extremely frustrated and ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. I tried taking it out on him by killing him but the game wouldn't let me. I had no choice in being a lone wolf villain. It was pointless, no matter how many times I shot him or the characters with him, they wouldn't die.\n\nIf you're going to force people to play your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ storyline at least make it good.

Well the fact is this game made for consoles and its a real struggle for pc players to use.\nUser interface is god awful and obviously made for consoles in mind but in the same time feels unfinished - modders get to work.\nSome keys are hard coded - no way to change them. This wouldnt be a problem if the default keys were somewhat intuitive but they are anything but and that is making your game experience a struggle.\nThe tutorial section is doing a ♥♥♥♥ poor job of giving you information.\nCharacter models feel funny - animations are quite decent tho.\nNO TOGGLE AIM DOWN SIGHT - a basic feature in shooters - patch it in!!!\nFeels like some weird mouse acceleration is going on - no way to turn it off tho.\n\n-\nEDIT 1\nThe feral gohul animations are badass.\nSettlement building is as optional as shooting enemies - yes you dont HAVE TO do it but if you want to progress in the game you should consider doing it to some degree. So far my settlements havent been attacked tho so it was not much of an issue besides the awful controls that you have to endure while building.\n\nBased on my limited time so far the game feels like it sacrifices the rpg mechanics for a more seamless shooter/action-adventure feel. To be fair tho the shooting part is decent.\n-\n\nEDIT 2\nThe shared keys are annoying as ♥♥♥♥.\nI exploded myself on a few occasion (bash and throw are on the same button) and it is really annoying that reload and "transfer" (to put stuff from your inventory to a container or corpse) is shared as well so when you are in the middle of the action you can accidentally open the transfer screen by simply moving close to a body.\n\n-\nEDIT 3 - might contain minor spoilers. Proceed with caution.\n\nSo far Ive been negative in this review so lets see the positives.\n-Lot of ♥♥♥♥ to discover and collectibles to find (which are actually pretty interesting)\n-The shooting part is decent.\n-I love the way power armors work in this game ,too bad they pretty much mandatory on harder dificulty settings. It is because of how the game is "balanced". Lots of oversized enemies can one or two shot you if they get a hold of you. The power armors tho really feel powerful and I love it. Also if you jump into water while wearing them you cant swim and you will just sink down to the bottom.\n-Heavy weapons look bad.♥♥♥!\n\nThats about it now lets get back to the negatives and my subjective whinning.\n\n-Stealth was dominant in the previous games but here it feels sub optimal.\nIt is really hard to take someone down from a stealth kill(survivor dificulty) and even if you do you will drawn the rest of the pack to yourself.\nSilencers are in the game although you need a specific perk to craft it.\nAmmo is also scarse so you will not always have ammo for your silenced weapon.\nA lot of the enemies are also meele (gohuls, vicious dogs, scorpions, mutated dogs, deathclaws, rats and certain raiders and supermutans etc) so they will catch up to you.\n\nThe map is not particularly big although it has a lot of locations and its really crowded. This can cause some frustration as you can easily pull multiple packs of enemies unintentionally while kiting.\n\nThe VATS changes are pretty annoying. Now VATS dont stop the time just slows it down so you dont really have an opportunity to make a strategic decision because you can be killed while using VATS which means you have to click fast and hope for the best.\n\nDuct tape is the core essence of crafting so collect as much as you can.\n\nLegendary enemies are the ♥♥♥♥ing worst because they can heal themselves up to maximum health instanly (only once tho) so if you are low on ammo and engage with one you will most likely die.\n\nStory is whatever I was okay with it personally but I think you shouldnt be able to play arround after finishing the main quest line but honestly its not a big deal.\n\nEDIT 4\nI forgot to mention the most annoying thing about this game. Which is that you have no gameplay variety when it comes to combat.\n\nLike i said the gunplay is the most polished part of the game however the guns you can have are all boring and generally weak in harder diffs.\n\nThe way this game is balanced is that you have your heavy weapons with high damage but its hard to find ammo for them and you have the generic automatic/semi-auto rifles and pistols but the thing about these is that they just dont feel al that different.\n\nLike I also said above stealth is crap at the moment so sniping a horde of enemies from the distance might not work most of the time(especially against stronger enemy types like mutans who can 1 shot you with a rocket launcher if you dont wear your power armor). The perk system has a damage upgrade for semi auto rifles, auto rifles and pistols but they are all spearated into 3 different perks so if you want variety you are forced to lvl up those perks.\n\nYou might also run out of ammo of your main gun and if that happens and you have to use a gun that you are not spec-ed into you will do less damage and it will be painfull.\n\nPower armors are meant to wear them. What I mean is that there is no disadvantages of wearing it in fact the game is ballanced around the power armor so you pretty much forced to play in power armor due to the overpowered enemies that would otherwise swarm you and kill you.\n\nMeele weapons and explosives with a backup rocket launcher is the way I played around a bit. This setup is way more powerful than any gun in the game.\n\nAlso I have to mention the crafting system is shallow af. You cant make weapons you just modify them and most mods are pretty much the same on all the guns.\n\nThe lack of gameplay variety shows on perks as well. For example you always want to go to high inteligence because a perk that gives you "high tech mods" is require high int. What I mean is that there is only one way to play and its very hard to find something gimmicky or weird character build (for me that a huge negative)\n\nEdit 5\nAlso as of recent if you install mods you cannot earn achievements so your full priced game is no better than the pirate copies that you could have downloaded for free.\n-\n\nMy advice would be - drop the hype and prepare for a letdown.\nHad nearly 250 hours in this game and i played multiple characters. I cant honestly recommend a buy because this game has everything that is wrong in a multiplatform title and it disrespects the fallout legacy really hard.\nOther than that its a decent open world game with some watered down rpg elements.\n(sorry for the bad english)","November 9, 2015","false","289.2"," 563 of 984 people (57%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","57","563","984","22","11"

Within my first hours I was blown away, it was a new experience. It was fun, and I was loving it. Probably about 15 hours in, I started to notice the flaws and oh boy is there a lot of them. The building mechanic is probably my least favorite thing about this game. It honestly feels like something they chucked in last minute to make the game more unique. Don't get me wrong, if done right it could have been a welcome addition to the game, but it was not done right. Its a clunky mess, finding the right materials takes a long time, too long. Worse yet it forces you to do it for certain quests, so if you can't find one bit of oil then you can't progress anymore.\nNext the quests. The quests are the worst from any bethesda game ever. Dull and repetitive. Very uninspired and lack luster. I found myself doing the exact same quests over and over and over, with minor differences, be it the enemies you are sent to kill or the location you are going to.\nNext the main story. Now the main story was spoiled everywhere, so obviously I'm not going to enjoy it as much. That being said, it was weak, it was very very weak. At the end of the game, my honest to god thoughts were "oh that was it, that was the end I guess" very unsatisfying.\nThere are aspects I like about this game though, I find the power armor and weapon customization really fun. Using power armor is always a blast, and finding new sets is a treat.\n\nMy final verdict.\nI think this game was very, very overhyped. I played into the hype and was excited as a little kid at christmas, but oh boy was I dissapointed. Its not a bad game, its just not the game we expected. Bethesda can do much better then this.\n\nEDIT: After around 75 hours, I have no more quests left. Well "real" quests anyway, I am doing the same 3 quests over and over again. I have gone town to town, settlement to settlement looking for a new quest. I don't remember a single Bethesda game has had me searching for quests. Another thing that has left me utterly dissapointed is the lack of again "real" quests. So after 75 hours, I have reached my end to Fallout 4. There is nothing left for me to do, other than start a new character, but I just dont want to do that. Goodbye Fallout 4.\n\nEDIT 2: After a long time, I've finally come back and visited this game. I've put some serious hours into it, and it's better the second time around, it is still very flawed and I still agree with all of my previous points. If you played this game previously and didn't enjoy it, I reccomend giving it another go. It's more enjoyable the second time.","November 14, 2015","false","197.1"," 497 of 868 people (57%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","57","497","868","19","8"

These villages have no contact with the surface world or other villages, and are under constant threat of earthquakes. After normal humans ceased to be, the psychic endowed humans established a stable society where they control their powers by using genetics and brainwashing to make themselves incapable of hurting one another. The act of murder activates the Death of Shame, causing the murderer's body to shut down and die instantly.When their ancient enemy, the Orochi rises once more the girls' long-sealed personas awaken to defend the world. The Orochi awakens on the first day of October, Himeko and Chikane's shared birthday. The first Orochi who tries to kill one of the mikos is Soma Ogami, Himeko's childhood friend. However, after a blinding flash of light brings him to his senses, he rejects his fate and vows to defend Himeko against the other Orochi. The mikos must awaken Ame no Murakumo to combat the threat, while Soma repels the Orochi's efforts to kill them.Simon and Kamina learn from Gin that humans on the surface are attacked each day by Gunmen piloted by beastmen, humanoid creatures who serve as Lordgenome's army. Kamina hijacks a Gunmen and names it Gurren, combining it with Simon's Lagann to form the mecha Gurren Lagann. Aiming to defeat the Monster Lord, Gin encounters a strange monster named Alice. Traveling together with her, he eventually discovers that she is in fact the Monster Lord. But Gin decides that Alice is not a bad being. He chooses to continue traveling together with her. Finally reaching his destination, he arrived at the Monster Lord’s Castle. After defeating the Four Heavenly Knights, the Monster Lord Alice stood in his way. However, he holds back in their fight, and refuses to let Alice sacrifice herself. He realizes that the true thing blocking humans and monsters from coexisting is Ilias.

That's why every NPC hates me.\n+ Sprinting (Positive) - A very useful addon.\n\nNeutral :/ Minor bugs - Stuck in a tree? Or in a rock?\n/ Building Settlements (Neutral) - Very enjoyable at first, then annoying as hell.\n/ Critical Strikes - They are not random anymore. I, personally, don't use V.A.T.S. so, it is kinda useless for me.\n\nBad :- Slow rendering - This happened me and some of my friends. Graphics don't load fast enough. Sometimes i only see plain, untextured objects.\n- Minor optimization problems - Random FPS drops, this happens rarely, but can be annoying.\n- Very few weapon/armor models - I kinda annoyed by the number of weapon/armor models. They are all customizable but you cannot change some parts.\n- Dialogue - You will have 4 choices in every dialogue. That limits the RPG immersion unlike the old Fallouts games.\n- Story (Negative) - The main story seems rushed a bit. And it has the worst prologue in the Fallout series.\n- Sprinting (Negative) - Uses AP, i cannot use V.A.T.S. because of that.\n\nConclusion :Do not be scared by the bugs, bad reviews and cons.

It's just really bland. And story-wise quite ridiculous, and I don't particularly care for the representation of the factions (e.g. the BoS). Also, building the settlements and then maintaining them wears out *really* fast.\n\nOther than that, exploring the wasteland still has its charm (although a lot less, since all the quests basically boil down to shooting things) and the combat is really fun.

I have other things to do in my time than to spend 2 full work days to simply compress 16hours of play-time into 2hours of content.\n\nThe beginning of the game engages you into what you think is going to be a great game, then once you're about 15minutes into it, you realize you've been dropped into a game with:\n\n- Barely any character development. I have no empathy for my character.\n- A desolate world full of useless objects (They're not useless? Well, what do I do with a toaster? Is this another "you need to spend 7hours in the game to find-out how everything integrates with each other" situation? Thanks for instructions Bethesda. I'm not at work, I want to play a game.)\n- The building feature has no tutorial. The UI is confusing and incomprensible. What am I even doing with a building feature? Again, no tutorial.\n- Certain choices in the game leave you with a big "WTF? What do I do now?" (Leaving your body armour behind, forgetting to call for your dog). It's not a matter of logic, it's why am I not being told how important it is to have my body suit with me? Or that my dog doesn't listen to me when I tell it to stay when a mob is attacking me, but if I tell it to stay and walk away from it, it doesn't follow.\n- AI is super lackluster. There are countless people commenting about how they can screw-up AI by walking around a car to with screw with poor pathing algorithms. Or the mob will simply stand there because it doesn't have proper line of sight.\n- Boss "elite monster" mechanics are boring\n- Controls are all over the place.\n- The game feels like there's no substance. Too much atmosphere and a boring story that's barely told to get you interested in the game.\n- There's zero motivation to do quests\n- Choices in dialogues are boring and predictable\n- Graphics really aren't that impressive (expected as it's a 5 yr old game, I suppose)\n- The game feels less of an RPG and more of a shooter\n\nProof of Console Port\n- Clunky interface meant for controller navigation\n- Non-intuitive HUD and controls\n- Choosing your dialogue requires your mouse or arrow keys (not number keys...)\n- TERRIBLE PC support. You need to modify a few config files because the in-game options doesn't have FOV, VSync, Mouse Acceleration, Mouse Smoothing etc.\n\nI'm not even sure what to say anymore...I'm really disappointed. This game is for build junkies, loot hoarders, and die-hard post-apoc fans. If you want a skill-based RPG game, this isn't it...","November 10, 2015","false","5.7"," 465 of 812 people (57%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","57","465","812","25","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/radmander/recommended/377160/","radmander","Radbuns","http://steamcommunity.com/id/radmander/","88 products in account","Having fixed the constant crashing and graphic issues of the game, I played the introduction, the first quests in the game, 7 hours later I'm almost half way through the entire map. I will try to keep this review objective, because this IS a decent game, but it's so flawed and lacking that it really deserves not to be recommended at this time.\n\nPros:\n\n-Fluent fight mechanic, the change in VATS allows for a different take in target areas, doesn't stops time anymore.\n-Interesting crafting mechanic, letting the player to scrape almost the entire /game/, and build a settlement\n-Weapons, except powerarmor, don't break, allowing inmersion in the game itself rather than just metagaming for items, (though whether that's one of the elements of any RPG is subjective and open to interpretation).\n-Armor and weapon customization are really easy to do.\n-You can increase your base stats at any time when you level up.\n-The companion commands are fun, though not useful for combat, it is a fun aspect for recon/stealth.\n\nCons:\n\n-The game is rushed story-wise, as the character introduction is REALLY forced upon, and then forgotten right away.\n-The perk tree is really simple, and while it might be a different take on the intended gameplay, it forces the player to meta-create a character with a good knowledge of it's stats, as the perks have base stats requirements instead of skill points, which are now removed from the game. This is a huge downgrade from the previous versions, and makes it less of an RPG than it could have been.\n-Lackluster dialogues, things don't add up to the lore of the game, as stated above. There's a big disconnection between the character you're supposed to roleplay and your actions in-game.\n-Little to no inmersion, such as lootmenus pop up when you kill enemies, ironically, provoking the result that was trying to be avoided with the removal of the previous metaelements.\n-Story and content is, apparently, replaced by crafting and scraping, while fun and interesting it doesn't makes it up for the rest that's missing\n-There is no more karma to your actions, and whenever you gain standing and reputation with NPCs it happens without notice. Maybe a good thing? Bad thing? It is open to interpretation, but I don't feel it was well implemented.\n-Graphics are decent, textures can be pretty washed out and sometimes glitchy, not polished enough as promoted. Enviormental designs are great, but it really doesn't feels like something /new/, it is more like an upgrade to Fallout 3.\n-Map is way shorter than previous games, anyone after 10 hours of playtime can, in fact, have more than 50% of the whole scenario explored. While being easier to get from point A to B, it's lacking the promoted content.\n\nPerformance:\n-Random crashes on release, eventually fixed after 2 patches and GPU updates.\n-Abnormal waiting times. SSDs do help, but even if you have the best specs, sometimes it's going to give you a 20 second loading time, or more.\n-Decent framerate, sometimes it drops and lags out of nowhere, it's not that bad.\n-Enabling steam overlay over the game makes it prone to crash. I'd say avoid it for a while.\n\n\nThe game itself:\n\nThe main plot it is so forced and rushed that it makes the whole experience really awkward in itself. You wake from a 200 year old cryostasis, your wife is killed and your son kidnapped, and 10 minutes later you're in a power armor shooting a deathclaw helping a settlement of survivors to establish a community again. This, might be one of the main problems with this game, the lack of interest in it's own story and pace. There is none in this game. The attention to the main character is focused in such a way that you /assume/ that you really need to invest yourself in your character, but the dialogue choices are not your own, and there's little variety in it, just a bit of exposition and yes/no. The game feel is so vague that it really feels more like a standard FPS rather than the RPG hybrid that was supposed to be.\n\nIt is not by all means a bad game, but this was clearly rushed for this year. With all the expectations, it feels like Bethesda didn't deliver, and didn't knew how to. This game NEEDS to get more content, and even more work done on it. It really, doesn't feels like a finished up game. It is not worth $60 right now. Do get this on a summer sale, or when it's on a $15/$10 discount.\n\nA fun game? Yes. A good game? Far from it. A fallout game? Not even close.","November 11, 2015","false","38.2"," 253 of 437 people (58%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","58","253","437","12","3"

Lucky me. Why?\n\nThe game (so far) looks like a pretty solid successor for FO3/FO3:NV.\nThe thing is, you can't use any custom key bindings. Oh, don't get me wrong, there is a configuration menu for this. It's just that half of the keys can't be configured. Looting corpses is always 'E' for example. How convenient when you've been using a ESDF layout for 20 years. So while you run along, your character is trying to loot every single box, drawer or corpse you walk by.\nOthers are lefties and would like to use IJKL or the Numpad. The Numpad btw, is just completely impossible to bind to. What a big bundle of joy. For just 60 bucks ... plus 30 for the season pass maybe.\n\nFix that!\nThen I'll buy the game for myself and write a review actually tackling the game's content.","November 11, 2015","false","276.7"," 135 of 228 people (59%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","59","135","228","5","9"

Quite honestly. None of them have any basis of value in their posts.\n\nI'll admit the release is buggy, but what game isn't? it's also not working for some, but again, when has a game ever worked perfectly, or completely for every single console, platform, and graphics card in existance on release? None.\n\nSo the majority of these complaints are immediately wiped under the floor as well. Game isn't trash just because its not released bug free.\n\n--------------\n\nFallout 4 has far more custimzation and choices than Fallout 3. I'm finding it far far easier to RP my character how I want her to be. The new Perks system is wonderful. More than Fallout 3, and with deeper customization.\n\nYou can certainly put 1 point of perks into the basic of each perk, and be a wild card able to do a little of everything, but you won't really master anything either. The more points you put into a perk, the better it gets, and on the final level of that perk you generally get a very nice bonus to it. Either way it allows for much deeper crafting of your character.\n\nAn example would be the stealth perk. As you continue to put points into it, it goes up, 20% harder, 30% harder, etc. But say you also favor long range weapons, and you only wish to put 2 perks out of 5 into Stealth, because of your longer range youd on't need 40-50%, and you can put those other perk points somewhere else.\n\nThis allows for deeper customization, rather than just 1 perk point in stealth for a flat bonus all around.\n\n------------\n\nThe graphics as well are pretty damn good, even on all low settings. Many are whining about them, but I see absolutely no problems. Most of the screenshots you're looking at, are probably in Low settings, yet they look awesome. I've yet  to see an "ugly" texture, or "flat" surface.\n\n------------\n\nGameplay wise, the area's as far as I can tell, don't scale with you unlike Oblivion, Fallout 3, and Skyrim. You will come across area's that you really have business being in yet, and the enemies will be very dangerous. This to me makes the game far more adventerous, and feel dangerous and alive. Sometimes, you gotta retreat and come back later, better prepared, and armed for what you're going to confront.\n\n----------------------\n\nOver all this game is awesome, and delivers on everything it promised. It has a great story that pulls you  in, a more believable environment, and one which is more interesting than Fallout 3 in my opinion. The ability to build your own towns and manage them which is a very fun meta game in and of itself, something which took me 8 hours of playing with ,and still tons to go.\n\nThe writing for the characters is not bad either, with nice mix of personalities, and backgrounds.\n\nSo long as you aren't expecting a game that's 10 years ahead of its time, like it seems so many were, and it's a type of game you enjoy, or like Fallout games, this is one that is most likely well worth your money on release.\n\n----------------------\n\nNote: It seems people aren't understanding me. I'm not saying its bad to have high standards (I do). I'm not saying its bad to dislike this game. (There are parts I don't like either). I'm not saying its wrong to say this game just isn't for you. (even if it is for me).\n\nMy review here, and my "rant" post here http://steamcommunity.com/app/377160/discussions/0/496881136898465390/ explains this, but also why I did write that rant post and this review the way I did. People are  going off the deep end with expectations and presumptions of what this game "was supposed to be".  Without realizing this game is exactly as it was meant to be, and just because it didn't hit what the hyped up version they expected in their minds doesn't make it a bad game.\n\nI also explain why expecting no bugs in today's world is both Idiotic, and shows a very low understanding of the world you live in. Depending on the engine of the game, and such some games may have a better chance of having few to little bugs on release, but Bethesda isn't using Uneral 4, or Cry Engine which have their own dev teams working around the clock to make it as streamlined as possible for every major graphics card. Bethesda is using their own game engine. One which allows for extreme non hard locked code, so ANYTHING can be altered and changed by the players, allowing for extreme modding capability. This, unfortunately does have the side effect of making the code less balanced. I won't get into why, or how, or the specifics, but it does, because the devs aren't hard coding it, so we can go in and mess with it to our hearts content, without screwing up anything else in the game except for what we wanted to screw with.","November 10, 2015","true","91.2"," 479 of 838 people (57%) found this review helpful 34 people found this review funny","57","479","838","34","19"

I want to like it sooo much... Anytime I leave a terminal it freezes and I have to reload. So pretty game breaking. After discussion pages it seems to be related to 144hz or similar. Since this is an "advanced iteration" of Skyrims Creation engine, where anything over 100hz made the water flip out, I'm thinking its related. It runs at 144hz however, thats a plus. For an "Advanced" engine though some environment effects are nice (lighting, effects), some textures and character models are pretty bland. Pretty much made for consoles with the large interface and poor high fps performance. I can't believe I just said that, but it's true. I killed the deathclaw with a 9mm, not the power armor because he was glitched in the ground. So as usual, lets wait weeks for modders or MAYBE Bethesda to patch it. Also, during a main quest, a character you have to follow doesn't move. No reloading will fix it. I love Fallout, this is very upsetting. Bethesda/10\n\nPros:\nStory. Pretty quick hook. Interesting.\nEnvironments on the whole look nice, lighting, effects etc.\nShooting, fps combat is better than ever.\nNew animations. Running, swimming look much better. Fighting a deathclaw that charges and grabs you? Awesome.\nMore Fallout\n\nNegatives:\nStory. It's, well, short.\nAbout 55 hours in I've explored 85% of the game. It has HALF the content of FO3. It's SMALL.\nCover. You cant hit enemies through it but they can hit you.\nA.I.: Enemy AI is improved, they get to cover, and you CANNOT hit them behind it, even if there are holes were you should be able to. General AI is not, with free placement of items comes characters just stuck blindly running into everything and staying stationary.\nGlitches: Galore. 2 or 3 gamebreaking ones. Hopefully will be patched in time.

Comparing it to another 2015 game, Witcher 3 is like watching professional actors.\n\n2.Story is dull, simple as that.\n\n3.Graphics on max settings may appeal to consoles, but honestly on PC it looks like 5 year old title.\n\n4.You can't remap controls - just a few of them. You can't bind anything to numpad. It's a big deal if you're left handed like me.\n\n5.The "map" is small, smaller than Skyrim (at least it feels this way)... and man is it uglier!\n\n6.Speaking of Skyrim I see a lot of "reuse of technology" from there with zero effort to improve anything. They just changed models and textures.\n\nand overall "bad console port" is written all over this game.\nAlso, as other reviewers said "Call of Duty: Wasteland" - yep, that sums it up.\nIf you're looking to buy a real RPG look elsewhere.\n\nWhat really killed it for me is that I did play Witcher 3 before this one and the immediate difference in both graphics and dialogue quality was so striking, like traveling back in time to days when "professional programmers" did all the voicing and animations were done only in 3D Max.\n\nIt's certainly not the "next generation of open-wrold" not even close.\n\nP.S. All that said, I will play my money's worth out of this game, cuz I just got nothing better to do. Adios.\n\n\nEdit: answering some questions from the comments.\n\nBy saying that the world is "ugly" I meant that there are same models everywhere, same broken tree I see in every corner of this dump, same structures, same everything and colors yeah, could have a little more variation. These artists even saw how real rust looks like?\n\nI completed the game by the way. It won't get better. It's just you who will get used to it. Used to people talking to a wall, when you stand in another place, used to awkward animation efforts, used to unnatural emotionless voice and unimaginable dialogues and so on.\n\nThis stuff is for 12y/o kids or w/e the current age limit on it is, while Withcer 3 was made by people who know what emotions mean and what life is about. Not saying about magic crap, if you can't see beyond that - I pity you.\n\nAnd if you, boys and girls, don't know, the author of the original Fallout was not there. He instead made a kickstarter-funded game called "Wasteland 2", imagine what he could make of it with the sort of money that this guys had.","November 14, 2015","false","95.5"," 676 of 1,188 people (57%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","57","676","1","36","27"

Many interesting locations, rather than giving you a fun narrative, are just raider/feral ghoul/enemy spawn points you have to clear out. This might be fun if the gunplay were fun, but you tend to either be under levelled for enemies who withstand withering fire, or over levelled and single shot all adversaries with ease.\n\nYou can piece together fun bits in locations to form a skeleton of a story, but after finding your 100th safe filled with useless pipe guns, armor pieces, and nothing else, you start to get bored. Likewise, characters tend to be a bit one dimensional. You speak to them once or twice then never truly interact with them again. Even the companions, most of whom are particularly cool, only give you one or two extra side dialogues. You're dying to know more about these places, people, and things, but there just isn't anything else.\n\nThe smaller complaints wouldn't be a problem if they didn't happen often. But they do. And it's terrible.\n\nI wouldn't call the game bad, but I can't recommend it because it's a bad fallout game. There are some great parts. But it all comes together to form a shallow, tedious mess.

"I'll just run over there and kill them" "Oh it's raiders now is it? but of course I'll go kill them for you" That is pretty much the quest system and main story missions for each of the factions, the nonsense that is the main quest after you've met each of them is just, well let me say I could only think "WT actual F" so many times before I had to start drinking.\n\nNothing is your choice, settlements are already predefined locations, most make little sense either cluttered with stuff you can't scrap, not built on a flat location, or other pointless things that leave you trying to fit things in, if you have the materials, the game provides you with many places full of junk to loot in order to create these things, trouble is, there is usually nothing else in these places and unless you have at least the ammo perk or that and the cap one you will literally just be wasting your time, resources and little ammo in the hopes that you will find some adhesive until you start growing it.\n\nrepetative "radiant" quests are thrown at you time and again, half the time with no choice to reject it, just about every npc is unkillable it seems, no matter how you think your character is and seemingly no matter what you do everyone you meet thinks you're a cross between chuck norris and my bean.\n\nIf you're a fan of cinematic action games then by all means dive in, if the improved combat, the settlement building and junk hordning is your thing then you'll enjoy the game.\n\nI enjoy the game for what it is but I am totally disapointed with my purchase, It's not what is advertised, it's not what I was told I was buying, It's totally not what it could be and should be, It's not like bethesda aren't capable but it seems they are no longer willing, yet the way they spoke about this being their "Biggest most advanced rpg to date" they seem to genuinely believe that it is all of those things and more.\n\nHubris.","November 23, 2015","false","335.7"," 484 of 848 people (57%) found this review helpful 79 people found this review funny","57","484","848","79","71"

I spent 60 hours in it. And yes I did do the NV main story, but I CARED. I don't value my stupid spouse and whiney child in Fallout 4. I found them annoying and needy (especially when the child cried). I was excited to roam the Common Wealth as much as I did the Mojave... but I was a low level and couldn't do squat without doing the main missions.

My biggest problem is the leveling,  Why would someone think that you have to be at level 10 to become an armorer is beyond me.  Or that you have to have a science skill of 10 with agility 10 and Endurance oh wait plus Perception to be able to build a wooden wall.  This is truely where they messed up.\n\nSo a game that is using a fairly stable engine with thousands of hours spent using it (Skyrim) why do we still have clipping issues, frame rate locks, FOV locks, etc...  The first hour playing sent me to Nex, to find a way to get rid of that stupid cashregister sound, then believing Beth would have a patch out for major bugs like when you use a terminal and then are stuck in place for no reason.  So far Beth has failed a beloved game imho.\n\nUnless you have to have it, as Christmas is around the corner, I would say wait for it to go on sale or after a couple of months and the Modders have fixed it for us.\n\nFor the most positive for the game is how you are shown what materials you get from items for example, a typewritter gives you gears, screws, steel, to use for building, enhancing your gun, armor, etc...  But you must use some type of adhesive on almost everything but the most basic and guess what,  yep the rarest item.\n\nI hated FO3 for being an FPS/RPG, well not anymore, FO3 is by far ahead of FO5 wait sorry i mean 4.  I am thanking God I did not spring for the Pip Boy addition when I could afford it.  You can use your phone to act like a pip boy if you wish.  But beware of the lag that goes with it.\n\nAs for graphics, If you can play Skyrim, Batman, BF4, on Normal settings you can play this one.  I have a GTX 760 and the recommended settings by the game are ultra,  I even turned them down to see if there was a major difference and nope not really.\n\nMy review may be all over the place but its like the game, i can't say yay go get it before paying your rent and nor can I say not to get it on sale.  Just do not expect this to be the Game of the Year.  I am wishing right now I bought Black ops 3 instead of this one.\n\nI pray the modders can make this game great or maybe whomever the creative people who made this realize gamers are not idiots and actually want content for 60 bucks.  If we didn't we would all be playing ios games on our phones and not build/buy computers that could feed a small villiage in a 3rd world country for 10 years.","November 11, 2015","false","163.4"," 299 of 520 people (58%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","58","299","520","9","0"

If this was the first in the series, I would rate it higher, but my expectations based on previous installments lowered the score. Thing I will explain in the review.\n\nI won't lie. Like most, I was hooked on fallout 4 after playing the first 2 hours. The game showed so much promise, but after beating the mainstory and starting my second play through, I realized, quite honestly, there was no reason for a second play through. Like most have stated, there is no choice system or karma system in this fallout. There are 4 endings, 3 of them end the exact same way, the only variance is which factions you dont wipe out at the end (which you dont get to chose, you make enemies of 2 of the factions based on which one you chose for the ending). Also, with no level cap there's no reason for a second character, unless you wanted to replay the main story missions with a different style weapon.\nThe game has its ups, but if you were looking for that 100hour+time sink that most people expect from a fallout game, you won't find it here.\n\nthe settlement building is a nice addtion, but the UI for it is atrocious, the rules seem inconsistent. I can scrap an entire house in sanctuary but ONLY IF ITS TOTALLY COLLAPSED, for whatever reason. Settlement locations are predetermined, with most being very small 2 person farms which you get by "clearing out those nearby pesky raiders/ghouls" every..single..time. Seriously there's about 5 farms like this and the dialogue is the exact same at every single one.\n\nThe graphics are great for the scale of the game, no issues there, and the combat is the most fun its been, which I think is why so many people played the first hour or two, and immediatly went to every social media saying this game lived up to the hype. I was that person, too. Until i finished the game and felt pretty hollow inside.\n\nAtmosphere(graphics, environment, sound): 9/10\n\nCombat: 7/10\n\nStory: 3/10 (The story itself isn't bad, but compared to previous fallouts, the lack of choice, karma and effect, etc, it just doesnt compare, No replay value to the storyline, because you can do all the side quests for every faction before getting to the "point of no return" in the story. Outside of the 4 main factions I haven't seen many sidequests worth doing.)\n\nContent: 4/10 (Settlement building was a nice addition, and you can do a lot with it, but there is no depth to it. your settlements don't tie into the main story and it doesn't affect the game at all to improve any of the settlements, whether your settlements are happy or not has no affect on anything other than the number of settlers there. Basiclly just a 3D version of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ phone fallout shelter app. Weapon and armor customization is the best its ever been, and the addition of legendary equipment is nice.","November 23, 2015","false","55.1"," 344 of 600 people (57%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","57","344","600","19","24"

They are like teleporting while attacking...\n\nI have played now about ~43 hours (+~4 hours idling altogether) and i am done with the main quest, which was very disappointing at the "end", i really forced my self to end this game after 16 Hours...it was very hard keep me playing with this boring Story and Gameplay.\nThe Quests? Well, most times you just KILL, KILL and KILL very monotonous...which means cleaning Areas and maybe search for something, thats it!\nTrust me! Scroll through the Questlist, you only have"eliminate- or find-"Quests...sometimes there is a different quest, but that makes no changes, because it ends like the others.\nReally, everytime i talk to a character and he gives me a Quest, the Goal is to clean an area, i clean that area, talk to another npc or even the same and i have to clean ANOTHER AREA...what is Bethesda Softworks THINKING?! This is an RPG not a Shooter!\nAfter more than 35 Hours i have NOT found any deep and complex Quests beside the main quest! And the main quest begins very well, in the middle it is still interesting but then monotonous! You will get bored, trust me!\nEverything feels so 'empty', if you walk around the world, you will not find much creatures, npcs, random encounters, or Cities and on.\nAfter i finished the Game, i start watching Streams and Videos of Fallout 4, always the same, the quests never really change.\n\nYou walk through the world and you will find like 4 enemie types at all... the world feels so empty and everything looks almost the same...\nIn every Safe or Container you almost find the same stuff, ammo, a gun and on, it is always the same! There is no excitement in exploding, you find always the same boring stuff.\nYou never feel like you are moving through a unknown exciting world, it is more like you are walking through a fan made map for Fallout 3. Or you can say everything is made for the main quest...so you don't have much outside the main quest.\nAnd the Cities? Well, there you go, i will not spoiler you but i can tell, you can count the amount of cities (not ruined cities!) with one hand and these are not very interesting or huge!\nFor example there is a abandoned city with like 12 Buildings, but you can only enter ONE Building, the others are barricaded and some of them has a clipping issue, so you can look through the doorframe and see it is just a Model...\nIf you would ask me, to describe Fallout 4 with any other game titles, i would say 'Call of Fallout: the Crafting Simulator'\nThe whole game could work perfect as a non-open-world shooter, it feels like that these "RPG-Elements" are just in the game because they want to call the game a RPG...\nI am so disapointed about Fallout 4, not at all, but with the World, the Quests and the Design.\nSo far i can NOT recommend this game at all, i will forcing myself to continue playing it, maybe i will find any interessting Quest or place but i don't think so...\nThis game has no Adventure feeling, it feels like a simple shooter with Quests and a Inventory...\nEven Fallout 3 and New Vegas are masterpieces compared to the World&Quests of Fallout 4!\nIf you ever played fallout 1 or 2 like i do, you will know how good and deep Quests has been done!\n\nPlease also read this Review:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/id/Yagey1/recommended/377160/","November 11, 2015","false","47.5"," 251 of 435 people (58%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","58","251","435","9","1"

Same Dialogue everytime. Like really??\n-No Factions/Karma System. Basically 4 Factions, no minor factions with quests/adverse affects to the main story.\n-No Crafting Ammo..No different types of Ammo. I've seen limited amount of Weapons, just lots same weapons with different names, similar to Borderlands type of Weapon System, random generated. - (Mods make it possible to craft Ammo)\n-Map feels really small, after 8 hours of Gameplay you explore over half the map...after that a-lot of back and forth of spots..Leveling system makes old areas Obsolete, kinda like Borderlands.\n-Worst social options I've ever had in any Bethesda Game, Yes/No/Maybe/Sarcastic? REALLY. It makes talking to others So BORING I end up skipping/clicking anything because of it, zero entertainment, zero logic, dull. - (Mods fix this with Open Dialogue)\n-More a FPS game than a RPG Survival game. They've removed more features than they added (Maybe they'll come with DLC.)\n-No workshop support.\n-Console Port.\n_______________________________________________________________________________\n\nOpen World building shooter game.

Some perks are nothing but boring stat boosts and offer nothing new and exciting mechanically, and almost feel mandatory to continue to survive in the world. Eg. Generic weapon type damage increases.\n\nStorywise, the game is lacking, the main story was quite rudimentary, even spawning a myriad of memes about it. That said, some of the side quests, and the general background atmosphere and characters you meet more than make up for the lack of character in the main story. Some of the different 'Vault stories' you read about and experience exploring the various vaults spread across the game world are far more interesting than the main story.\n\nFallout 4 introduces a few new mechanics to the series, such as crafting/modding weapons and armour and settlement building, both of which are conceptually great, but awkwardly implemented. For example, swapping mods out requires you to craft new mods to replace the original ones rather than just being able to break the weapon down for parts (albeit you can break down weapons into crafting materials with certain perks).\n\nAs with all recent Bethesda games the ui and control scheme is horrible on pc, and suffering terribly of consolitis. Speak of which, the game looks relatively dated even on max settings.\n\nOverall though I still enjoyed this game and would recommend it.\n\ntldr;\n-Buy if you like exploring and shooting.\n-Don't buy if you were expecting a story that didn't seem like it was written by someone on the spectrum.","February 1","true","97.7"," 49 of 76 people (64%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","64","49","76","5","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/xvocab/recommended/377160/","xvocab","okay","http://steamcommunity.com/id/xvocab/","842 products in account","This is a tough one. On one hand the game has the spirit of fallout, and is a lot of fun, on the other hand the game is the most shallow fallout in the entire series.\n\nLet me start by saying if you enjoyed fallout 3 you will probably like this game...somewhat. It has a lot of similar vibes though lacking in a lot of areas. The gameplay is much improved, and playing without VATS is completely viable, and somewhat prefered in this game. The world is big, almost too big actually. There's stuff in the game that's not even labeled on the map so exploration is as dense as it gets when it comes to fallout. The crafting is a big step up, and directly ties in to the settlement aspect of the game. There's a lot of quality of life improvements in this game that really make playing it over the previous ones much better for new, and experienced players.\n\nTechnically the game runs well if you have high specs, sometimes. There are areas in this game that makes the most high end computers cry. Some of the downtown areas near good neighbor, the power plant, and the trinity tower are highly unoptimized. If you are on the fence about the game wait until the first couple of offical patches that address performance. The sound is pretty good. I'm not the biggest fan of the sound track, but there are some decent tracks. The radio has some songs that were in previous games. There's some nice classical songs that fit a lot of the crazy chaotic moments to. One of the best moments is a classical piece playing when some guy shoots a fatmann at you, and you know it's over. The explosions are pretty insense in this game, and the feedback from them are a pretty big step up from previous games. Visually the game looks great in a lot of ways but it also look bland in a lot of areas too. Some interiors look really high quality, while some just look flat.\n\nHowever, the games not a great rpg compared to FO3/NV. In fact, this game has tipped the scale and has basically become a shooter with rpg lite mechanics. Some people will like it, and some people hate it. There's not really any great ways to role play. This game isn't about the character you made, it's about you the player. The entire game is about player empowerment. You no longer have to care about a build because the way the perk system works. You are essentially gated by levels, and you can be pretty good at everything. Your character isn't a blank state either. You are forced as a mom or dad seconds into the game. Yes, you can play almost 60+ hours without going to Diamond City, but the game will force its agenda on you eventually. As a fan of Fallout this is quite disheartening.\n\nSo why don't I like it? The biggest issues with the game are the lack of player agency, quests, and dialogue system. These things define fallout to me, and they are done poorly here.\n\nPlayer Agency - The ability for the player to make the choices that help shape his or her story, the choices that directly influence the game world. The ability to roleplay. If you played the original fallouts you know there's certain builds that change how you play. This allows for great moments in rpgs. Some of the best games of all time have choices that can completely change the entire game, and this creates a world that reacts to your choices. This game has very little decisions that actually matter outside the main storyline. Almost all roads lead to the same path in a good portion of quests. In fact, there's a lot of time where you can't even say no in some quests. It's really odd, and my character who had fairly high charisma still didn't get much choice in a lot of "decision" making of the game. Another reason why I think the player agency is weak is simply because the dialogue system lends it self very poorly to the rest of the game.\n\nDialogue Choices-  When bethesda showed off the dialogue wheel at e3, there were a lot of mixed reactions saying there would be only 4 choices per conversation, it's just the beginning, the choices will open up later!, look how dumbed down it is, and that it's fine, mass effect does the dialogue wheel great, and even games like Alpha Protocol, and Deus Ex Human revolution found success with it. So what do I think about it? I think it's a massive step back. For starters, you don't know what your characters going to say when you choose the options, and that's the biggest issue with it.  Even though it says words on the option doesn't mean that's what you get. When I choose sarcasm, and I going to be a witty charismatic kind of sarcasm, or a complete ♥♥♥♥ bag sarcasm? Sometimes it's neither, and it's that lack of consistency that makes me never choose sarcasm in a lot of conversations. None of the conversations come out the way I want it, and if you factor in the lack of player agency none of my choices really mattered.  It seems lazy. Yes their is a lot more voiced lines in this game, but does that really matter when It comes to on screen options? Well, yes, there's already a mod that pretty much has the entire line laid out for you, and shows you just how flawed the system is in the first place.\n\nQuest design - This was the breaking point for me personally. I wanted to really like this game despite all of its problems.  I was having a lot of fun. I even played around with the settlement aspect of the game despite it being poorly explained, and being very time consuming. The quest system in this game is just extremely bland. Go here, Clear this, Plant this there, Meet this guy or girl. It all amounts to nothing a good portion of the time. I did a quest called the big dig, and it was such an elaborate escort quest that was for.....nothing. I was completely blown away by how much time was spent doing that quest that the only reward was an abandoned power armor exoskeleton which I already had 4 of them before I did it. The amount of interesting quests I ran into were personally lower than any fallout game I have played, and that's completely unforgiveable. It's pretty sad the birthday party in Fallout 3 had more outcomes than the majority of Fallout 4 quests. Fallout New Vegas took the modern series to new heights offering some of the best quest design with many branching paths. There are quest lines in New vegas that have so many possible outcomes that its just shows me bethesda didn't put a lot of effort into their quests.\n\nThe game promised infinite quests, and oh boy they weren't kidding. Do you like repeatable dailies like in MMO's? Well fallout 4's got you covered. I think after the 8th cleansing the commonwealth quest I did to save another settlement (which after you have 10+ settlements the games becomes completely impossible to manage all of them) was me not caring anymore. Areas you previously cleared will now respawn because you triggered a quest to clear it again. It's boring as hell, and it makes playing Fallout 4 "proper"  a waste of time when things respawn in areas you already cleared. The ironic thing is that all the factions have types of quests like those, and some of them appear to be the same old boring repeatables, but some of them have rewards, and good ones at that, but only after you do them 4-9 times. Thanks Bethesda.\n\nDo I reccomend this game as an rpg? No. Do I recommend it as a action game with rpg elements or a shooter with some rpg lite flavor? Absolutely. It's a lot better than a lot of the same tired ♥♥♥♥ on the market. From the world sprawling to the more bigger dungeon areas, there nothing really that comes close. I really wanted to like this game. The more I played it the more the game started falling apart. There's a lot of missed potential, and the story has moments where it lacks true impact. I really do appreciate that Bethesda started incorporating companion quests. Some of the companions are pretty good, and I'll commend them for that, but I think other parts of the game really need to be brought to the next level. Basic mmo fetch quests in 2015 is just sad at this point.","December 3, 2015","false","46.5"," 333 of 581 people (57%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","57","333","581","14","7"

This is pure "consolitis", this is blasphemy towards one of the best and most mature RPG series ever made.\n\nBethesda, you can't be blamed enough for that, and you made it for the console versions.\nShame on you a million times.\n\nI always disliked consoles, mainly because two of the best games ever made are 'console only':\nRed Dead Redemption and The Last of Us.\n\nBut now to see my favourite franchise ruined because of THAT?!?!...\nJust to do THAT?!?!?\n\nDon't you ever dare of simplifying conversations in such a childish and disrespectful way.\n\nWe are NOT stupid, don't think for a moment you can behave like Hollywood and get away with it.\nThe only stupid ones here are YOU, Bethesda.\n\nModders can fix things and improve games, but they can't fix stupidity when it runs so deep.\n\nPlease, just let Obsidian do the job.\n\nI mean it very seriously.\n\nAbout the plot (under construction):\nIf I ever experience a nuclear war and wake up the next day,\neven if it is over 200 years later,\nI just hope I am not as superficial and stupid as the main character.\n\nWhere is all the shock, the trascendence of the Armageddon, the sadness and all that rubbish?\nI mean, where the ♥♥♥♥ is everything???\n\nFallout 4 is the FIRST Fallout game starting right before the Armaggedon, and ANY character from ANY previous Fallout has more depth than the ones here. Such a loss of chances of writing a flabbergasting script. Something that could even beat other Fallout games in many ways.\n\nInstead, it's a blockbuster plot with superficial human reactions, flat characters, meaningless conversations, topical feelings...\n\nI still have to hear the main character ask ONE question about nuclear war, its aftermath, and how people survived and coped with it.\nAfter all, it is the main character's very next day. The absence of depth in that sense is brutal.\nWhat a pity.\n\nAgain, Bethesda: you are beyond stupidity writing scripts like these.\nFallout 3 is like reading Philosophy compared to this.\n\nMUSIC: Apart from a couple of new songs, they are pretty much the same of Fallout 3.\n\nA couple literally: It's All Over / The Wanderer.\nBoth included in the trailers.\nThe rest, Fallout 3 repetition or awful songs.\n\nConsidering New Vegas had a mindbinding soundtrack, and Mr New Vegas Secret Stash proved there are true jewels out there... Fallout 4 soundtrack is an act of pure laziness.\nUtter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and\n"another" missed chance.\n\nAh, and the achievement icons are AWFUL.\nDid you hire a child to draw them???\n\nLOVELY\nFallout Universe deserves this graphic quality and detail.\n\nAstonishing to get out of the vault and see The Wasteland as it always deserved to be.\n\nExploring the map is one of the strongest points in Fallout games,\nand man oh man how the game could be if the script had half the beauty of the rest of the game.\nBecause exploring is beautiful\n\nIn that sense, I am more than hooked.\nThe ambience is a wish come true.\n\nMusic:\nWhat a fantastic masterpiece Inon Zur has created here. The music immerses you all the way as much as the map.\n\nWeather and climate conditions:\nAgain, a-m-a-z-i-n-g!\nThat fog, that rain... what a great job.\n\nBattles and fights:\nWell they ain't that bad after all... kind of a bit too much dependant of your first person view,\nbut the fact that VATS does no longer freeze the battle gives a lot of tension.\n\nSettlements:\nYou can spend so much time in there!\nIt is a bit confusing the first hour or two, and it takes I suppose one or two entire playthroughs to understand and value all their possibilities.\nFlabbergasting adding to the game.\n\nYou can jump while overencumbered!\nThis is one of the best improvements in the series, believe me you.\n\nJet slows time!\nIt works just like Implant GRX in New Vegas.\n\nNOW it is addictive :D\n\nDo I recommend this game?\nWell yes I do, absolutely.\n\nBecause I want it to be a blockbuster, so more and better Fallout games come.\n\nAnd a new Fallout game is always welcome, no matter what.\n\nFallout 4 is an experiment in every single possible way regarding previous titles, and many of the results are very, very good.\n\nNext time you know it is Obsidian's turn to do something "overwhelmingly positive".\n\nSomething that Fallout 4 will never be.\n\nThanks for reading this review,\nI'm gonna keep playing it cheers see you later bye thanks for the fish.\n\nAh, and there is Dogmeat.\n\nWhat else can you ask for?","March 29","true","135.3"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","2"

Yes like so many I've played and loved all the earlier incarnations of Fallout. I know the mythos. I've stuggled and partied on with the improvement misses and wins. Yes I followed along with all the discussion of where's the next Fallout going to be. What effect a branch within Bethesda might adjust gameplay. Thing is no matter what has happened earlier within a game series, each incarnation while it may resemble prior output. Is a new game and it's best to treat it as such.\n\nSo a little background for those new to the game series. Read nearly every review and you'll be hit with this quote "War. War never changes." It's a knowing and yet by now amusing start to get players in the mood to play in this world. The world is not much far off from the one we live in. Think post WWII 50tys early 60tys fashion and style. Except in this world they took nuclear power and developed into their energy based technolgy drive. Cars ran on atomic power cores. Robots were household everyday helpers. It's kind of the world promiced to us with the "World of Tomarrow" tours they put out in the early 60tys. A robot does your housework. Everything easy and automated for everyday life. Now think for a moment what happens in that technical marvel utophic future if all goes to pot with a nasty little nuclear war with China...\n\nThat's the setting of all the Fallout games no matter which region they are set in. This is America after the Fallout starts to clear. Blast craters bleeding radiation. The water is poisoned. The food grows radioactive. The old foodstuffs you find aren't much better. Lazerguns being shot at you, though of course a cobbled steel pipe gun can be just as nasty. Wepons are super franksteined or near space age. Sometimes it's nice just to find a funtioning weaponsbench. Ammo is always running low. You've got Ghouls both the still inteligent, the starting to slip into brain degraded crazy town, and the full out zombie ferals. You've got mutated animals, mutated super mutants, near endless tribes of Raiders, technology scabbers, gun hording militant gangs, the Brotherhood of Steel, killer robots, deathclaws, and even syththetic soildiers all of them running around more than happy to take a shot at your noggin. Pick a side, you'll apreciate the help. You crawl over crumbled buildings. Crack open chambers sealed against the blasts. This wasteland is devastated and covered in salvagble junk. You're in Boston and the surrounding suberbs this time. And yes once again you are a Vault deweller. But there is a nice new twist to that old shtick.\n\nSounds like fun, doesn't it?\n\nGRAPHICS: Top knotch standard you get nowadays from Bethesda. Everything is lit well, good texture, and nice color palate. While it's not really pretty it does look as if it could very well be real. As an aside: a few weeks of playing this and my dreams now often are these landscapes. You will get immersed in the visuals.\n\nAUDIO: Guns, growls, wepon blasts, explosions.. they are all well done. The voice acting for everyone...well except you are excellent. Yes you read that right, your character whether male or female has the most uninteresting voice within the game. That and the dialog choices are my biggest gripe about this game, more later on the subject.\n\nGAMEPLAY: You've got your standard wasd mouse point movement. Space for jump. Quick keys for inventory favorites, holding you breath durring scope use, throwing combustables, using opening, and taking items. Mostly standard contols, not much of a learning curve.\n\nYes you get a lovely pipboy. For those of you new to the experiance. Your pipboy is a radio, your maps, inventory access, quest display, stat lists, and bestower of the lovely VAST time. While is not the total freeze of past incarnations. This rendition is more of a mildly sluggish "bullet time" effect. The world still moves, just through molasses. So I advise you to pick you critals quickly cause you've only got a couple extra seconds. Also players of earlier rendition need to note that going into your pipboy and taking healing will no longer give intant healing when you leave the pipboy. It skips ingame swallowing or chewing but you're still going to have to give them a few mommets to work. Yes that includeds stim packs, though if you want to stim up in VATS time you'll buy a rew secs there for yourself. Just be aware.\n\nNow to the issue of your protagonist's dialog. Unfortunately Bethesda chose to go the route they took with Mass Effect. Chose one of 4 choices with the arrow keys, hints will be given in color shifted selections. Those that require a little push yellow, more push orange, and real hard to convince red. Gone are the old well wriiten dialogs of the past. All you are given are short clippped and pretty low impact selections. They added insult here in my opinion with poor voice acting for either protagonist choice. I'm not happy with this. What you said and how you said it should matter in gameplay. I miss the old philosophical monologues, they were a nice counterpoint to the devastation of the surrounds.\n\nGone is the repair your rapidly degrading weapon and armor by combing them with another. You now have to uses a scrap bench you take possesion of for parts to upgrade your current wepon and armor pieces. They took away that almost ridiculous degrade factor. Your gun now lasts in the condition you found it in. While this is good. All those lovely wepons and armor bits carry a lot of weight, you'll be schlepping around. You will miss that ability to crunch your inventory down.\n\nThey have added town building to this new rendition. While a lot of players may stess how little impact it has on the plot. You will eventually after you've been at it a while, find some benifit to it. Traders are scarse. But setting up your town with a wepon bench, armor bench, scrapping worktable, chemical worktable, and a cookstand; will let you adjust your inventory nicly to a benifit. Not to mention storage, even a garden. And if you snag the right skills and make a few friends. You can put in a traing post, even set up a trading line. What do you need access to, there's probably a way to add it to your town. Set up enough spots and you can greatly reduce your need to always be repetativly going back to base to clear your inventory space. Oh and by the way you'll even have to build your bobblehead stand.That's right.. they brought bobbleheads back (THANK YOU). Those cute little stat and skill boosting little figurines are once again scattered around the common wealth.\n\nAnd I can not stress how fun it is to get ahold of power armor so early in the game.. No this isn't the game imbalancer you might be thinking. Powerarmor is the only armor that can be shot to pieces. You'll be repairing it frequently if you always wear it. And well you can't really do that. Power armor takes powercores to operate. Those aren't commmon, not impossible to find. But the few you do find you burn through them quick when you wear a suit. So fun to have, hard to maintain.\n\nOVERVIEW: I love this game. It's just as fun as all the earlier versions. Just as satifiying to blow a raiders head clean off. Just as nerve wracking trying to survive waves of ferals comming at you from all angles (those buggers climb in though holes in the walls now). Same "oh crap" feeling when you spot a deathclaw. The main plot is compleling yet you'll spend a great deal of time doing everything else before you even get to much of it. Case in point 100 hours so far myself, no where near where I might find someone who knows where to find my remaining family. Much less close to that family. There's a lot to do and you will love doing it, main plot be buggered..\n\nI will mention that so far the dhls that cost extra, look as if they should have been included in the basic game. I haven't bought them yet, so I left them out of this review.

Why give me a spouse?  Why give me a baby? I don't want to be THAT person, I want to be anyone I want in each playthrough! I want to make up my own background, my own personality, so that my own decision will make sense. And that is what a ROLE-PLAYING game is all about.\n\nThe quests are G.E.N.E.R.I.C. and repetitive, and I am not talking about those thrice-damned radiant missions. There are no humors, not even dark ones, in Fallout 4’s quests. I can only recall the good ones like the Silver Shroud and the Cabot House, albeit very short. I want quests like Dead Money or Old World Blues in NV, which give me enough reason and curiosity to solve the puzzle or trouble.\n\nPlaying on survival difficulty, the combat is actually very good. The customization of weaponries and not-so-Legendary Legendary variant of enemies keep me playing. But as for character specialization, there is none. Fallout games used to emphasize on specialization (hence the S.P.E.C.I.A.L.), you have a level cap and limited attribution and perks to make your play style unique. In Fallout 4, at Lv. 200+, you will be almighty and omnipotent. Want to Blitz? Or Gun-Fu? Or Sniping? Just switch between weapons. Knowing that everyone with enough patience will get the exact same result makes my character so G.E.N.E.R.I.C..\n\nI enjoyed the game, but the G.E.N.E.R.I.C. story and quests really let me down. I wish Bethesda would work with Obsidian again in Fallout’s future installment.

(Nuff said)\nImmersion (Despite its flaws its possible to sink in for hours, the game is huge, lots of interesting location to explore)\n\nMixed:\nGraphics (better, but still the same old engine with somewhat better texures and postprocessing)\nCombat (lots of improvement in mechanics, but there is no choice, figthing is mandatory with few exceptions)\nPointless settlements (can be interesting to start and build something for a change, but they don't serve any usefull purpuse so far and I fear it will be just another excuse for game to force player into yet another fight whether he wants it or not)\nInterface (managing equipment, trading is mediocre at best, shooting is ok though; bullets acually fly where you want just like in NV not F3)\n\nBad:\nAcuall RPG mechanics (which are almost not existent at this point, I've played Stalker with more RPG than this, it simly a disgrace to call it S.P.E.C.I.A.L - it has NOTHING to do with original system developed for F1 and F2 )\nDialogs (everything in there is wrong, both script, choices, execution, everything. Voiced protagonist is supposed to have a character, but this one feels like plaing a bipolar sociopath if you're not playing yes-man)\nQuests (Fetch and kill = get 100 caps + negotiation/charsima * 25 / just another dungeon crawl with ghuls/raiders etc. )\nStealth (Had to lower the diffulity level, weapons just felt weak, Level design is not stealth frendly so far and its linear like hell)\nConstant need of scavenging for trash (It may seem like a good idea at first to use this for crafting, but quickly looses any charm and becames another boring grindfest)\nCompanions (underdevelopt, boring and flat characters)\n\n\nI will continue to play this game cause I bought it and might as well finish it once However I strongly recommend to not buy this at current price and wait for sale. It's not worth the money.","November 14, 2015","false","252.3"," 217 of 376 people (58%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","58","217","376","8","3"

First off the problem that most people have had is the FPS, then theres storywise the illusion of choice, where everything pretty much ends up the same with everything, but don't get me wrong the ending is different, but only slightly depending on who you choose.  Then theres the storyline aswell, which just feels like it drags on and on and on, which may sound nice having a long story, but no it's so damn dull throughout all of it, e.g when you finally find out what has happened to your son, you just feel like "oh ok, well who cares, I think I may just switch off and go outside now".  Even the side missions that you usually get in Fallout just feel more dull and less exciting, it all just makes you really feel like the playing the game is actually a chore.  Then theres a few personal reasons for me not enjoying it, but mabey some people may agree that they are bad and first off is combat in general, the only way I can describe it is that it feels rugged, kind of like Borderlands, (which is a great franchise mind you) but a little more slow and poorly done, it's just I personally dont enjoy that style of combat, honestly the faster smoother style feels better to me, like the last two games, though this ofcourse isn't the worst thing in the world.  Finally theres the enemies, you can find a good few types of enemies in the game, but I swear I am sick to death of just finding sodding bandits everywhere I go, mix it up a little why don't ya.  But I will also point out the positives, the games companions are quite fun to talk to and the character creation was quite fun aaannnd..... thats about it.  Overall the game did not feel like a Fallout game and I mean that in a bad way, it is CERTAINLY NOT A RPG, and is a miserable excuse for a game compared to it's predecessors (yes even Fallout Brotherhood of Steel) and I am very glad that it did not win Game of the Year.","December 22, 2015","false","46.6"," 176 of 303 people (58%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","58","176","303","8","0"

I've played 1, 2, Tactics, 3, and New Vegas countless times with different builds. I just beat 4 with 132 hours logged on Steam. I have to say that this game is a huge let down. The graphics are beautiful but that's about where the good things end. I don't want to spoil anything story wise, but the story and end game is weak. It's practically Fallout 3 all over again.\n\nThe lack of a karma system is mind boggling. That is practically what the Fallout series is built on aside from Fallout Tactics. There are literally no repercussions to any good or bad deed that you do aside from a town being ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at you.\n\nRemoval of the Skills system is rediculous. You come wandering out of the vault and are a pro with all guns. No thank you. More flavor lost.\n\nThere are many more things wrong with this game, but it would spoil storyline and I don't want to do that. This game does not deserve the Fallout name. I understand that They wanted inovation, and I'm all for that, but this game changed way too much. It's more like Farcry than Fallout.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rofldanger/recommended/377160/","rofldanger","Hamdip","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rofldanger/","186 products in account","Fallout 4 is a good game. It's not a GREAT game; it's just a good game. Why?\n\nWell here are my issues with Fallout 4:\n\nThere's not a whole lot to do. At all. Most of the game is just going around shooting ghouls and super mutants, and... that's it really. I mean, they tried to add interesting things, like "settlements" but those are just pointless as all hell. Let me elaborate on my opinion a little, and break this review down into sections so I don't ramble.\n\n1. Graphics and Aesthetic appeal.\n\nThis part of the game is a great improvement since Fallout 3. Aesthetically much better. The lighting is great, the textures are mostly good, except for a few, and the people look OK as well. Visually appealing.\n\n2. Sound.\n\nSound is fine, for the most part, but nothing exceedingly great. Music is just meh. Dialogue isn't WRITTEN badly, but delivered atrociously. Protagonist is a god damn robot with depression.\n\n3. Gameplay.\n\nGameplay wise, it's decent, as far as core mechanics go. The shooting and combat has FAR been improved from Fallout 3. You no longer are forced to rely on VATS for any kills. I actually got the majority of my headshots and kill outside of VATS. To be honest though, beyond that aspect of the game, I would say that's all it has going.\n\nThe quests are just boring. There's nothing truly interesting happening at all. Find your son simulator, basically. Here's my big issue with this, and I know I'll sound like a typical hipster for saying this, but Oblivion was Bethesda's best game. Sure it was clunky, and glitchy as all ♥♥♥♥ (every Bethesda game is), but it had the most involving world of all their games. Ever since Skyrim, Bethesda has dropped the ball on making an interesting world. Where are the insane side quests, that end up being more epic than the main story? Where is the diversity in enemies? Where's the deep lore and care for the world? Where's the diversity in the land to traverse? It's gone. There's nothing in this game to hold your interest in exploring or doing any sidequests. I had a brief moment where I thought I found an interesting side quest, and it was the Witch Museum. It started out relatively creepy and mysterious, but turned out to be a 5 minute "Kill the deathclaw" quest. Why? That had potential to include a new enemy, or tie into the Point Lookout DLC in Fallout 3 or something.\n\nRemember playing Oblivion and finding that town of invisible people? Remember entering a random Elven ruin and finding completely new enemies? Remember finding secret rooms in churches? Remember the Dark Brotherhood, and the MASS amount of questing from that? Remember how the questline for the Mage's Guild ended up being longer, and more important than the main quest? Remember how actually finishing the ACTUALLY had a direct impact on the game's world and residents? Well, forget about that in Fallout 4. You can quest til the cows come home, and kill everyone on the planet and I guarentee you won't notice a difference.\n\nAdding to the gameplay section of my review, let's look at settlements. This is something that when I started the game, I was very excited for. I thought "WOW, it's like the SIMS mixed with Fallout! AWESOME!" I did not know how wrong I could be. I've never seen a more useless addition in a game. What do they do, you ask? Well, I'll tell you! NOTHING. NOTHING AT ALL. They sit there, complain when you're not constantly droving for useless materials, and... that's it. In 50 hours of gametime, literally saw only ONE ever get attacked. Why build defenses? I set up shops and tasked people to them. NO ONE EVER SHOWED UP TO THEM. They don't DO ANYTHING. They are the most vicious cycle of a gameplay element I've seen. You can have them harverst food! For what? So they can eat and do nothing? Literally nothing. They don't help you fight, they don't have anything useful to say, and the only quests you get from them, are to get MORE settlments. They are a huge waste of your time and effort.\n\nNext off - CRAFTING! I thought this would be cool too, but guess what? It wears on you too after about... 5 hours. Want to make a good gun? Well you need metal... and nails... and glue, and glass, and wiring, and asbestos, and circuitry, and wood, and cement, and nuclear energy, and love, and sugar, and spice, and everything nice, and the head of a demon, and a car battery, and an elephant, and not to mention God's blessing before it all happens. Seriously, I've never seen a stupider compilation of "crafting materials." This should have been compacted to maybe four or five things like, metal, wood, concrete, electronics, and ... honestly four materials would have been better even. There's so many ♥♥♥♥ing different things you need it makes your head spin. WHY??\n\nNext topic - THE WORLD\n\nThe world in the game is not amazing. It starts out OK, but after about 10 hours, you've seen it all. It's just a big abandoned neighborhood basically. That's it. Just some residential, a few taller buildings, and a coastline.\n\nNow I know Fallout 3 didn't have an INCREDIBLE world, but the difference between that game, and this one is one BIG distinction, that kind of boils back to my earlier point - THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS WORLD. Fallout 3 and Oblivion may have been smaller, but there was WAY more inside of the world. So much more to do. Fallout 4 is just... dead.\n\nTHE CREATION ENGINE -\n\nThis engine is a pet peeve of mine.  Screw the creation engine. I appreciate them trying to make their own unique style and look to the game but... it's just bad. It's always been bad. Glitchy, graphically behind a generation, and slow as all hell no matter how good your system is. JUST USE UNREAL, OR FROSTBITE, OR CRYENGINE, OR SOMETHING!\n\nPeople love to counter this by saying, "WELL ITS JUST BECAUSE THE GAME IS SO BIG IT RUNS SO SLOW!" No. It's just optimized HORRIBLY. Look at MGS: The Phantom Pain, HUGE world, and looks FAR better than Fallout 4, and yet runs at around 130 FPS on my system. I'm lucky to get FO4 to run at 40 FPS. Not to mention countless other games that are bigger, and look better like, Farcry, GTA, The Witcher, Dragon Age, etc. JUST USE UNREAL.\n\n\nSUMMARY - Overall, despite my negativity, it IS a good game. It's a lot like the game "Destiny." It's a GOOD game. Not a GREAT game. I'd play Oblvion or Fallout 3 before this one.\n\nI have to stop here before I write another 12 pages. I could go on about the dialogue choices being awful, and much much more, but like I said, I have to stop now.","January 27","false","45.6"," 43 of 66 people (65%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","65","43","66","2","3"

If you just want a good shooter with rpg elements you may buy this game. If you want a fallout role playing game you will be deeply disapointed.\n\nLets first talk about the gameplay very shortly. I like it. It feels good when you shoot stuff. There are lots of different weapons which can be modded and so on. The enemies are well done and there is much to explore.\nThe controls are basically like Fallout3, so they are ok in my opinion.\nFor the graphic Bethesda choose to put their effort into the assets instead of a high tech graphics engine. Which i think was a good choice for this game. It looks good and still manages to create great atmospheric moments through lighting.\n\nSo, why do I dislike the game then? As short answer: the game designers and story designers from Bethesda clearly had no idea what a fallout game is all about. Sry guys but you failed so hard that it hurts.\nTo further explain this i will talk about two points. Some people may consider this as spoilers, though i will just talk about what happens in maybe the first hour. So if you do not want to know anything about the beginning you have to trust me :P\n\n\n1. The character you are playing. The problem is that this time the character has a pre defined backstory. In the previous games you could always create your own character and act like you felt was fitting. Here you basically play a parent of a young infant. You live in a pre war suburb or something, probably never had to deal with violence and in the next moment you are thrown into the nuclear wasteland.\nMy problem is how the character reacts to the situation. To give an example: NPC:"Can you help us kill the raiders that threaten us?" You:" Yes, sure" (This is your first sidequest). There is no believable emotional reaction or whatsoever.  My conclusion is that you play a bloodthirsty psychopath. The fact that it talks is just the last nail in this coffin.\n\n2. There are actually very intersting features in this game like, town building, the power armor, crafting, cool enemies and so on. (If you are a dog friend unlike me count the dog in >.<). The problem is the game designers decided to throw that ♥♥♥♥ after you like it is nothing. 10 Minutes out of the vault and you help some settlers. They are like, hey there is a power armor on the roof, why dont you take it, ahh yes and also take that minigun. As if this wouldnt be enough that the game presents you two of the most iconic items right at the beginning you also kill a deathclaw with it....\nThe settlers are like, hey do you want to be our leader? Ok lets build a settlement.\nBethesda, i want to work for stuff like that! How ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ are these settlers anyway? Waiting for someone who just emerged from the vault, not knowing anything about the wastelands, and immediatly crown him to their leader? How did these people manage to survive in the wasteland anyway?\n\nTo conclude this, the world is not authentic. I dont believe that this world could exist, because everyone is either a useless settler waiting for you to help them, or a raider shooting anything on sight. There are characters which are more interesting, but it always feels like they do not belong into this world.\n\nOne last point which might be interesting to know.... the game uses the same disretized difficulty system like skyrim and oblivion. So it happended to me that a radroach at some point took 5 hits with the same weapon i one shotted it always with.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","November 15, 2015","false","52.7"," 298 of 522 people (57%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","57","298","522","8","5"

What from remains a mystery. Unfortunately, the energy to his fusion core runs low, to the point where the armour stops functioning. He accepts defeat, halts and breaks down near a half-collapsed monastery. Thinking of survival, he exits the armour and approaches the monastery, in hope to find someone for help. He notices a small candle burning wildly through a closed window. It’s getting dark. Gingerly stepping up towards the entrance, he begins to move the cast iron door knocker. A small group of men slowly open the door, monks, who glare at the vault dweller.\n\n“My fusion core has ceased. Do you think I could stay the night? I can’t find my way back until sunrise.”\n\nThe monks graciously accept him in, feed him dinner, and even replenish his fusion core.\nAs the vault dweller tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound; a sound like no other that he has ever heard.\nThe next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say,\n\n“We can't tell you because you're not a monk.”\n\nThe man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his journey.\n\nSome years later, the same vault dweller winds up down the abandoned road, in front of the same monastery. His glow to his pip-boy has worn out, leaving him lightless for the night. He approaches the monastery and raises his hand to move the cast iron door knocker. Whilst waiting, he notices the candle still burning brightly in the window.\n\nThe monks again accept him in, feed him, and even fix the light problem to his pip-boy.\n\nThat night, he hears the same strange mesmerizing sound that he had heard years earlier.\nThe next morning, he asks what the sound was, but the monks reply,\n\n“We can't tell you because you're not a monk.”\n\nThe vault dweller has had enough.\n\n“All right, all right. I'm dying to know.\nIf the only way I can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do I become a monk?”\n\nThe monks reply.\n\n“You must travel the wasteland and tell us how many blades of grass there are still intact, and the exact number of sand pebbles. When you find these numbers, you will become a monk.\n\nFeeling confident and full of purpose, the vault dweller sets about his task.\n\n\n\nSome forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. The monks slowly open the door to see the man standing before them. He smirks and begins talking.\n\n“I have travelled the apocalyptic wasteland and devoted my life to the task demanded. I have found what you had asked for. There are 371,145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”\n\nThe monks reply,\n\n"Congratulations, you are correct, and you are now considered a monk.\nWelcome. We have been patiently waiting.\nWe shall now show you the way to the sound."\n\nThe monks lead the vault dweller to an old rickety wooden door. The head monk emerges from the dark room, telling the man that “the sound is behind that door.”\n\nThe man reach for the knob, but the door is locked. He asks "What? Can I have the key?"\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens the door..\n\nBehind the wooden door is another door made of stone... Agitated, the man requests the key to the stone door.\n\nThe monks give him the key, and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby.\n\nHe demands another key from the monks, who provide it.\n\nBehind that door is another door, this one made of sapphire. And so it went on until the man had gone through doors of emerald,...\n\n...silver, topaz, and amethyst.\n\n“Finally”, the monks say, ”This is the key to the last door.”\n\nThe man is relieved to be at the end.\n\nHe unlocks the door, turns the knob, and behind that door he is astonished to find the source of that strange sound.\nIt is truly an amazing and unbelievable sight.\n\nBut I can't tell you what it is because you're not a monk.\n","January 12","true","076.4"," 346 of 608 people (57%) found this review helpful 384 people found this review funny","57","346","608","384","53"

You follow a linear set path for a character and that's it, there is a few different dialogue options that don't lead anywhere, and the few choices you can make in this game are; who you're character falls in love with, and what faction you want to become affiliated with. The factions are definitely cool I'll say and it's an improvement from Fallout 3 and much more like New Vegas, and Fallout 1 and 2.\n\nThe shooting in this game feels good, really good for a Fallout game, and it's a welcome surprise to anyone who would have played the previous Fallout 3 and New Vegas. Everything else though especially the level up system just feels off somewhat, it doesn't feel like Fallout at all, and while I'll say that the Fallout level up system is extremely bare bones and simple, the new one doesn't feel that much more innovative or RPG like.\n\nThe crafting system is really good actually, picking up every object in the game actually means something this time and gives a reason to pick up tin cans and wonderglue, and the settlement stuff can be quite extensive but somewhat disappointing considering what you can't do with it, but it's optional and pretty cool nontheless.\n\nI can say Bethesda took 2 steps back with this one and 1 step forward. It's better than Fallout 3 overall but it doesn't hold a candle to the original Fallouts and New Vegas.\n\n\nI can probably recommend this game for someone who hasn't played a Fallout game before, or just wants a fun shooter to mess around with in an open world that likes picking up loot and or building stuff. I would still say if you want a really great Fallout game, go play Fallout New Vegas. In my opinion it's the best recent Fallout game to come out and gives you an idea of what an actual Fallout game is or was in a more nuanced way compared to the originals.","May 22","false","71.8"," 78 of 129 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","78","129","3","0"

You want a brilliant-written story along with unique dialogues? You want a game where your choices matter? Do you want to replay a game over and over because it has so many opportunities that you can't simply explore everything on the first go? If yes, then go buy "Fallout: New Vegas". "Fallout 4" is the opposite.\n\nWell, my previous review didn't publish for some odd reason... I'll start over again. I want to express my opinion far too much. Considering the word counts and limits I will not point out every aspect, but...\n\nI am a huge fan of Fallout series. Just like a lot of people here, my expectations were really high when I watched the trailer. I was really happy and I could wait; except, the more leaks I saw, the more sceptical I was.\n...and I was right, I should have been, and if you were watching E3, you should have been too.\nNo, take this; although I was expecting a mediocre game, it went beyond my disappointment.\n\nWhere shall I start...\n\n1. A series that was known as one of the greatest RPGs of all time is laid to rest. Fallout 4 is an amputated version of what once was a role-playing game. It is insanely linear; although there is an open world - which is of a decent size, not huge, not large, just decent - the game manages to be linear as the number of solutions to each quest barely exceeds one. ONE.\n\n2. The dialogue system... the most horrible thing of all. There are 4 options in total. FOUR. OPTIONS. RPG. FOUR. How can that be? I guess it's self-explanatory; a game cannot possibly be a RPG if there are 4 options. Furthermore, these four options always. well, 99 % of the game, include: 1. Question. 2. Yes. 3. No. 4. You're a ****! That's it. So, you have your own opinion and you want to express it? Well, **** you, you can't.  It's the ultimate failure. You barely have any power; I guess I would feel less offended if I had no choice at all, as this... this is lazy. Most of the time characters even say the SAME LINES, even if one is to choose different dialogue options. Imagine that!\n\n3. Perks... I don't know what was so wrong with perks in prior Fallout games, but these perks are just smashing. They lack any variety and creativity. Most are purely number-based; take this and get 20 % resistance, get that and get 40 % resistance, double your resistance, blah-blah YOU GET THE POINT. I will not waste too much time on perks, but before the initial release, I knew what 80 % of these perks would be. Why? Because they're copied from Skyrim and Fallout games that came before. Except they are simplified to an extent where it feels more like cheating then choosing perks.\n\n4. Boring, repetative missions... So boring in fact that I was moaning for approximately 5 hours, keep talking to myself and saying out loud: "who the **** came up with this, this is ****ing stupid!". At this moment there are only 3 requests I can clearly recall, although I played for a while by now.\n\nUPDATE: Most of the missions - approximately 90 % of them - involve you going and murdering.  May that be raiders, may that be mirelurks, whatever; they are as repetative as they get.\nSo, here's the way the mission usually looks like:\n1. get item "x" (or kill whoever at "x")\n2. you go and kill that whoever\n3. mission is done. congratulations, you now have an achievement!\n\n5. YOU. GET. THE POWER ARMOUR. ON THE FIRST MISSION. WHAT THE ****? Who thought this is a good idea? You are awarded with a minigun and one of the strongest suits in the game during the first 20 minutes of your game. Does this sound fun? And then you are to kill one of the strongest and most feared enemies of Fallout universe. What is the point?\n\n6. The intro is too short. I had no emotional connections to any characters; the only thing I've managed to do with my so-called "wife" is to sit on a ****ing couch for a minute. That's it. Find a son? Well, not only it feels like... *COUGH* *FALLOUT 3*... *COUGH*... you get no emotional attachment and you don't care what is it you're doing. You don't care why is it you're doing it. You do not care about the ultimate goal of the doing... and unfortunately, it feels like that with every mission. Why? Because you don't care. You do not care because the dialogue options do not let you say what is it you want to say. It's because that at the end, when you've chosen "yes", your character turns out to be saying "yes, but i will need your car, i am ready to play 1000 caps, by the way, how is your sister doing... whatever you get the ****ing point.\n\n7 The stupidest AI... this stupid dog runs into the Molotov Cocktail and then lies down, damaged and praying for help. Why? Because it can. I do not even have words to describe it...\n\nThese are to mention few.\nYou know, I think I understand why this game turned out to be "not so good" at the end. I think Bethesda hasn't realized why people like Fallouts first of all. Compared to this game, Fallout 3 was an absolute masterpiece. I suddenly start LOVING every single quest I had to do in "Fallout 3".\n\nThe game has some fantastic aspects to it. The FPS mechanics had improved DRAMATICALLY. It's amazing. The game has some unique locations to explore. It has a majestic - truly! - weapon and armour customizations. Gorgeous.\n\nThis is a good game overall... but with things mentioned above, I cannot recommend this game. I simply can't.\n\n...But it doesn't make up for it. Instead of putting the stupid ***ing mini-games to your Pip-Boy, Bethesda should have worked more on everything else. With the ****tiest dialogue options and repetative main story the game can only get you so far. One can't imagine how many times I was about to throw my laptop into the TV screen saying "I should have ***ing REFUND THIS PIECE OF ****! And maybe I should have. I, however, want to see what's going to happen and hopefully update my review in the nearest future.\n\nAn absolute shame. I enjoyed "Fallout: Shelter" more than Fallout 4...","November 11, 2015","false","110.6"," 646 of 1,146 people (56%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","56","646","1","30","31"

Unfortunately, SPECIAL system and perks have been too much simplified (no more skills for example), just like in Skyrim, karma/factions are no more, and dialogue options are way too poor to really feel like in Fallout (no more good/bad choices), now the adventure is so  linear and you have to comply with what you're being told to do (quests are too boring), you can't play as a scum or a greedy character...\nfuthermore, there are still a lot of bugs in the game, even after installing the latest patch.

So much so, that it kind of influenced me as a person, and made me who I am today. Simply put - I'm a post-apo freak :D Therefore, I have seen things, heard things, played things - enjoyed A LOT of post-apo media. It's what I love.\n\nBut until recently, Fallout was something that kept escaping my attention. There is no real reason for it, it simply happend as it happened. And I NEVER PLAYED any Fallout games. Ever. I was told that it's something "SOOOO, LIKE, FOR ME" and that I should "TRY IT BEFORE I GO STUPID" etc. That was years ago.\n\nFinaly, the planets aligned, Virgo entered Mars and - I bought a Fallout game. It was Fallout 4 (DUH!).\n\nAs a self-named post-apo expert = I loved it.\nAs a self-named video games expert = I loved it.\nAs a descent-but-not-so-great PC owner = I loved it.\nAs someone who expected 3/10 I give Fallout 4 a huge 9.5/10.\n\nThe storyline is great, the world looks great, the all in all impression of Boston after nuclear fire is amazing. It even made me go and google Boston, and see if Bethesda was making it as realistic as possible. A truly amazing experience, so far.\n\nI do have just a few issues with Fallout 4. The lack of a developers presence on Steam seems kind of discouraging, and there ARE bugs in the game. No matter what you do - there will always be bugs in it. But again, there are not even close to making the game unplayable. Definitely worth the buy, even at a full price.

I don’t have much time on Fo4 because it ran terrible on my system; I tried for hours to get the settings in such a way that would allow me to use this product.  My rig should have no trouble running the game but I was unable to get any acceptable performance from it.  On top of the poor performance there were a lot of crashes and failures to load.  I wanted it to work so bad that I tried to stick it out and play for about 2 hours before I got a head ache from the skipping and poor performance.  My Pro/Con list below is from these 2 hours or so.\n\nPros: The different looting system that brought up what is in the item from putting your cursor on it. – I never actually experienced this but I did spend a lot of time loading and reloading the game so I got to read a lot of the tips on the load screen and what they did with magazines was a plus.\n\nCons: Unacceptable performance – When  running (not sprinting) which is the basic movement, and you stop there is a weird bobble head movement that I could not turn off and it was crazy annoying – A lot of keys wouldn’t register on the first press, like hitting Q for vats, sometimes I would need to hit it twice. Normally I would expect this to be because of the poor performance but it was also doing it in the title screen and was also super annoying when trying to use a melee weapon – The text options are not Fallout like, it was very Mass Effectish with most option being (Yes, No, Sarcastic, Other) – I don’t know if I would consider this an RPG anymore and it felt very un-fallout, there is only visual character creation (which I have never cared about) as skills are removed (not totally against this and would have liked to see how this fleshed out), your back story and main mission effect all of the dialog options that I encountered in the beginning of the game.  I don’t know if this is only for the first part of the game (similar to Fo1 first main quest) or maybe I just didn’t care about the premise of the main mission.\n\nAll in all I am super disappointed in this game as it is.  I am seeking a refund which is something I would have never of thought I would say about a Fallout title but I can’t justify $60 for what I received from Bethesda.\n\nEdit: Was not able to refund this game because my "play time" was higher than Steam allows. I guess I will wait for the modding community to fix another game.

For me Fallout 4 runs at 60 fps on ultra. This is with my gtx 980, 16gb of ram and intel core i7 on windows 8. Some users have problems with the game crashing, glitches, bugs, cant save, mouse problems, etc. For me the experience have been good, but that doesn't mean it will run as well on your system, so look that up first.\n\nI'm gonna be honest, I am not a fallout fan and this is basically my entry to the franchise. I have played a few hours of new vegas a few years back, but thats it, so I cannot compare the story between games, the lore, etc.\n\nFallout 4 is gorgeous and colourful, which is the opposite of what I remember of the 'New Vegas' look. I even looked at some items up close and the textures was better then I expected from this engine! The lip sync is not that great though, that is probably one of my biggest complaints. Your character talks now and you can customize your couple (man and woman) in as many ways as Sims.\n\nIt's hard to tell how much inpact your choices have as of yet, but it seems like there's lot of replay value here. The intro part is interesting , but on the other hand it's a bit rushed. There is like no time for emotions even though a person you know well dies, which feels a bit wierd. You as a player didn't really have any time to interact with this person either.\n\nYou can bring a companion with you, like your robot or dog for example. From what I've seen this far the map is very big and doesn't have mountains like skyrim which makes it feel even bigger then it is. I could explore all houses I tried to enter, although a lot of them requires loading screen, even when it so small it shouldn't.\n\nThe UI and menu feels a bit outdated too, just like the lip sync. They could have made some of them smarter and a little more modern. I know that this is an old engine though, but for the most part you won't notice it that much, thanks to good graphics and detail level.\n\nThe crafting system for food, drinks and customizable weapons is great. Lock-picking is a fun little challenge (It's like the lock-pick system from skyrim) with different difficult levels and rewards. It's always satisfying when you lock-pick something open and find some useful items!\n\nAfter the first day with this game I can say that i'm pleased. That's a lot thanks to performance being good on my machine. I can say that fallout seems like an impressive game, but you might wanna wait a few weeks before you buy it to make sure that they release some official patches that might fix performance on all systems, bugs and crashes.\n\nModders will surely come up with some great things too if you just wait a bit. Unless you have a really good PC or you are in hurry to play this game, I think you should hang on for a bit. This is probably GOTY-material once these issues are sorted out though.","November 10, 2015","true","22.4"," 242 of 424 people (57%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","57","242","424","13","9"

Gunplay is mediocre, crafting is ♥♥♥, VATS is ♥♥♥♥ (I have 6 perception and it still sucks ♥♥♥♥), everything is ♥♥♥♥.\n\nThis game is actually a ♥♥♥♥ sandwich.

This was one of the definitive power armor mods out there.\n-Weather effects, including radiation storms.\n-Custom variants of already included weapons.\n-Settlement building (Real-time Settler)\n-Layered armor\nAnd a ton more...\n\nIn regards to the perk tree... It does feel watered down, but it also feels like, just like with the dialog, choice matters more. Instead of arbitrary skill points that add simple multipliers for you to work towards, you're instead given half your usual SPECIAL amount from previous titles, and perk options that carry a lot more weight. Instead of stat raising for combat and picking more diplomatic or resourceful perks, you're left with only the option to either invest in combat that level, invest in resourcefulness, or raise your SPECIAL to work toward something. The system actually feels a lot more unforgiving than the previous iteration, so I can only see it as an improvement.\n\nSame with dialog. While there may not be a defined karma system, karma is still technically there with the weight of conversation choices and your actions in general. In this game, it's less like karma is needed and more like it's completely redundant. This game just doesn't have a need for a system that was already sub-par to begin with.\n\nOverall, this game is a beefed up Fallout 3 with a significantly more immersive experience, more intuitive controls, and vastly superior graphics (which actually look better than the newest Call of Duty, yet people say they're garbage for some reason).\nI recommend this title to everyone. It is perhaps the best Fallout title to date. It is by far the best Bethesda title to date as well.\n\nIf you want a stat management game - a genre that's been on it's way out since Mass Effect, go try Pillars of Eternity or Wasteland 2. Leave your shallow and dated statistical elements out of our immersive RPG experiences.\n\nI thought I would edit this to include two things:\n\n1) I play on survival difficulty. While not really as 'Fun' as Hardcore mode in New Vegas, it is definitely more challenging.\n2) I play with a Keyboard and Mouse. This question was asked of me. I thought I would state it.\n\nEdit #2: I just posted this review on metacritic. I want to apologize to everyone for the horrible spelling mistakes it previously had. I originally typed this entire review on mobile.\n\nI also wanted to include a few additional tidbits...\nSome of the largest gripes out there have been heavily based on NPC characters in this game being nowhere near as deep as previous iterations. I unfortunately have to say that, after completing Cabot House and the USS Constitution, this is nothing but a bold-faced lie by people who have refused to give the game a chance. NPCs in Fallout 3 and New Vegas had a level of depth to them, but nothing compared to the complexity of the backstory to the Fallout 4 characters, what they represent, and who they are. I was taken off-guard after yes, seeing some otherwise boring characters, that there are some truly outstanding and phenominal characters that feel even more interesting than the entirety of the NCR, Caesars Legion, and Mr. House put together. While I haven't yet met this game's equivilant of Boone, I do expect there to be a character similar to his archetype here. Bethesda wasn't as good in Fallout 3 with companions has Obsidian was with them in New Vegas, but I can definitely tell there is a deeper level of development for NPCs and Companions in this game.","November 14, 2015","true","234.9"," 292 of 515 people (57%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","57","292","515","13","31"

As I cranked up the difficulty to the hardest level and journey my ways in the new wasteland in my power armor I was Kentor, Wielder of the Legendary bladed aluminum baseball bat.\nLong story short I ended up where I am today because of my journey the slayers of deathclaw. This game is worth a buy.\nIf you are new to the series, A Fallout fan or someone who is ok with changes you will like it. Otherwise those that hyped it or expected too much out of it please research some more or wait for mods before you do pick up this game. It is really damn fun though and I'am going for round 2 with mods installed.\nVideo review at the bottom\n\nPros + Love the skybox and landscape Graphic engine itself a bit rusty and could be improved more.\n+ Many quests all over The map looks small but so much to find and explore and discover.\n+ Building a base and settlement is a fun and of course optional.\n+ Character Customization adds variation\n+ The combat feels much more smooth shooting and melee.\n+ Weapon modding adds variety to weapons.\n+ Armors are now worn in layers. Much more fun to mix and match gear and stat.\n+ Enemies animations are better than previous game.\n+ Much better voice work\n+ The hours I spent exploring and finding easter eggs. Easter eggs are fun.\n+ Hundreds of mods support already to fix many of the issues players had with the vanilla version.\n+ The game gets Harder as you level up\n\ncons - The interface being more friendlier to controllers so it was fustrating for a KB and mouse user ( Mod being worked on this )\n- Dialogue choices only had one word as description to what your character will say (Mod was just released to show what dialogue are)\n- Not amazing in terms of the graphics wanted to see even more (Mod being worked on this)\n- Some of the quests were decent and some were star quality but overall could had branched out more.\n- Bugs and glitches of course, they're being resolved by patches.\n- Survival mode lacked actual survival ( Eating and drink to survive) (mod inc)\n- Building aspect of the game didn't feel rewarding  but is optional.\n\nIn short I don't think i'll have any cons for this game soon as people keep on releasing mods to fix all the issues thats in the game now. I think I should make a mod of destructive explosive weapons myself.\n\nVideo Review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5FWOmvx5fE","December 3, 2015","true","64.1"," 253 of 445 people (57%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","57","253","445","20","6"

That's fun for me. I love going around the world, playing a character I thought out.\n\nBut that's where Fallout 4 lost me. I just don't enjoy it, because I know the franchise is so much more than the game allows me to do. I have virtually no choices.\nAfter talking to Codsworth, I learn that everything has gone to ♥♥♥♥ and there's tons of raiders. I then go to Concorde to find out more. On the way I meet Dogmeat. As the player I don't trust this dog. Why would I? The last things I remember are my wife getting shot, my son getting kidnapped and Codsworth already told me that there's dangers all over the place. But I don't get a choice. He's my bestfriend immediately, the PC doesn't even get the option to be worried.\n\nOkay, I then assume my PC is a naïve fella, because his pre-war life probably affects that.\n\nThe first people I meet are the minutemen. They're fighting the Raiders. The character I am, has no reason to shoot either of them. I get no explanation to --why-- I should help the minutemen, the game just assumes I'm gonna do it, because that's obviously the good guys. This here contradicts there entire interaction with Dogmeat.\nI go on to shoot the raiders, helping some people I don't know at all. Then they tell me they're stuck there, and I'm their only hope. So what? I don't care for these guys and I frankly found Preston to be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. So I told them no, I don't want to. But I guess a no isn't a no, because I got the quest anyways. I couldn't even say no. And I couldn't even shoot the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I didn't have ANY say in what I wanted to do, it was all arbitrary speech options.\n\nThis is just one example of many.\n\nThis is not to say the entire game is bad by itself, because it has nice add ons and changes. The combat is smoother. The movement is better.\nHowever, none of this justifies the casualization and streamlining made in this game. You simply can't play the character you want to, which was a huge part of the Fallout series to begin with.\n\n\nIn short: Fallout 4 is streamlined and casualized. Its complete lack of elements that made Fallout the enchanted experience it was is gone. It's a wasteland shoot-n-loot with a Fallout title.","November 14, 2015","false","3.6"," 150 of 260 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","150","260","5","2"

Instead its got its own hud, a power management system, and lots more.\nIn-depthSo here we have one of the most hyped game of 2015 it was, did it live up? Certainly not for many. But the game isn't bad specifically people who haven't played the previous ones I can say will enjoy, as well including old fans who have a love and hate relationship with the game. But one thing's for certain this game in average won't provide the fun of making a second play through as we did in the previous fallout's.\n\nThe A.i, It's one of the major frustration's here, from companions to enemies.\nCompanions will get stuck in stairs,walls,not get in elevator. In all they won't follow around perfect,they won't be of much help, they will aim badly.\n\nGeneral npcs,enemies. They will sometimes not be able to find the path, or just glitch out.\nThis is what's called poor A.I simply. I know, I know it's a huge game so it should be common but come on after  many years they still haven't programmed the companions to get out of doors.\n\nIn all it's not that bad, but it adds up to frustration specially with the companions. While other than that it's fine generally in combat as well there's more options now on what a companion can do\n\nMuddy textures, it feels as if a blur thing is always turned on.\nHdr specifically in daytime is way to bright really not suiting for the eyes.\nEasily one of the best explosion effects.\nNight specially does look good, great sky-box.\nMuch of the particle effects have been seriously improved.\n\nIn total, the graphics aren't really bad as people say sure not for today's standard but pretty big improvement.\n\nThe collusion detection is messed up, it's always been like that over the course of so many year's they still haven't managed to fix it up..\nCats lying on peoples heads, dogs going under the ground, things getting attached to npcs not really kidding one time a hellmat got attached onto the face of my dog....\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=598566854\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=598567923\n\nNow lets talk about optimization, is it optimized well ? Or just a average console port ?\nWell unfortunately it's the second answer, it's a bad console port but not as bad as arkham night  that's just another story, but here the game is 30 fps locked, requiring you to change it up from files, really ? And there is many, many areas which lag for many people such as a specific tower area and so on. As well people with monitors that have more refresh rate then 70 are in bad luck as running the game more than 75 fps causes the physics to break-up.\nAs well many bad technical problems, after a month or so i wanted to play the game, it just wouldn't give me any audio. I've tried doing the directx fix, the audio settings but nothing's worked at all, as well there's much other problems like these.\n\nIt can be a lot better, as well with the 30 fps lock for starters adds up to similar as a console port.\n\nCharacter Progression\nIts really down-graded from all the previous games, the special skill things are gone, take the small-frame or many other ones for example. In over all it's just been dumbed down in terms of the fallout games.\n\nBut it's not bad actually compared to other games out there it offers a lot it's just not in-tune with the fallout games.\n\nDown-graded from the previous games for sure, but it still offers a lot compared to other games in the market. Could been better but what there is isn't bad\n\nThe dialogue, being the main thing of all the previous games, its just disappointing, just to take a more casual and similar to mass effect game's approach, this doesn't help at all.\nThe choices are really limited compared to almost all of the series, seriously lacking.\n\nWhile not terrible, but " lacking " is the word i'll use\n\nNow lets jump to the conclusion.\nWhile a disappointment for many including myself, its still a fine game despite its technical problem's and so. Why?\n\nBecause i can still go on my own adventures, and not give a frick about any story or any missions, i can be that, i can go out and collect good ♥♥♥♥, i can go out with my companions and raid the ♥♥♥♥ out of raider-"scum".\n\nThe sandbox is also really great, specially with the building mechanics now, there's a lot of variety turrets, houses, defenses etc.\n\nAs well with the inclusion of many new mechanics, it really adds up for a more fresher experience, radiation storms, crafting, base building and so on.\n\nIn all while taking a different turn from the others in the series, its a really enjoyable game, there's easily more than +50 hours game-play value here, which in terms is perfectly appropriate for a $60 dollar game. You'll have many adventures, you'll have many disappointments as you progress, but in the end you are gonna still have fun which is why we play video-games.\n\n==================================================================\n\nJoin our Giveaway Group and win every month over 2100 Steam Keys (Daily 70 keys) We love to share\nClick to join our Giveaway Group!\nClick me and follow us as Curator","March 26","true","62.8"," 20 of 26 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","20","26","0","24"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Radaney/recommended/377160/","Radaney","Radaney","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Radaney/","376 products in account","I'll get straight to the point, the step ups I see in this from other Bethesda games are;Character Customization was made easier and better.\nThere's quite a lot to find in minimal travel time due to the compressed map and the environment(s) are less copy paste. By find it's basically just a copy and paste building with two skeletons hugging each other ready to be screenshotted and posted on Reddit.\nThe enemies are more exciting to fight due to legendary affixes and general AI improvements but overall they are still bullet sponges with no interesting abilities or mechanics.\nCrafting has overall been improved and the fact random junk is not really junk any more takes a burden of inventory management and makes exploring which is a staple of these games generally more interesting but acquiring the same junk still becomes dull over time, the fact that going into a building and being most excited about 50 metal gears being on the floor speaks wonders about the overall game.\nBorderlands style weaponry with added mods and weapon affixes on rare/legendary enemy drops has added onto the gunplay of this game and adds to weapon diversity which has lacked in previous Fallout and Bethesda games. Complements the Borderlands style bullet sponge enemies well.\nV.A.T.S slows time instead of stops time which adds a sense of urgency instead of slowing down / stopping gameplay although the whole mechanic is still basically pointless and only exists in the game due to Fallout 1/2 when it actually mattered.\n\nPower Armour is sort of in the middle, it enforces fantasy and adds diversity and features to some builds such as a Heavy weapons and Melee build whilst some wouldn't use it all such as a Stealth build, however you get it very early in the game so it's not exactly something you stay excited about for very long\nThe new perk system is also in the middle. There are no more skills, it has been simplified into a perk tree influenced by stats every level rewards you a point to be spent on your S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats or a perk. There is no level cap though so you could get all of them. Some are also pretty unexciting.\n\nBut the game also has a lot of gameplay problems in my opinion such as;Copy and Paste fetch quests; in comparison even Skyrim had a few Copy and Paste quests but these were usually only found when you reached the end of a guild storyline but now the Copy and Paste quests occur at the very start of the 'Guild' storylines, this heavily detracts from the RPG side of the game by quickly estabilishing your character as a boring errand boy which does not feel rewarding and it simply isn't fun after the first few times. I'm not particularly glad that Bethesda built a whole game around their garbage quest generator for £40.\nIn my opinion the main storyline is very obvious and also generic especially in comparison to some of the other RPG releases of the past years. Although in previous Bethesda titles the side questlines were pretty decent, due to the mostly copy and paste nature from the get-go this time around they have fallen flat.\nStandard Bethesda Copy and Paste enemies plague this game too in some essence with the continuity of this is a different bandit that has a slightly different name and hits harder! although the affixes and AI are a step up in this department in comparison to The Elder Scrolls: Draugr Simulator 2011™ it's still an issue.\nCompanion AI can be extremely annoying by standing in your way and path blocking, pathfinding AI is pretty bad and playing stealth with a companion is almost impossible because they have no Stealth AI,\nAbsolute garbage UI in every single gameplay aspect.\nSettlements lacking in any exciting function or depth, I also find the lack of placeable assets when the game has so many in the environment an upset as well not to mention the locked amount of max placeables to cater to the games own poor performance. The feature leaves a lot to be desired. The UI is also absolutely god awful, I gave up on the entire feature when I couldn't figure out who is assigned to what and the settlements only purpose is basically to tell you to defend their base from 4 super mutants because apparently 300 defense is simply just not enough.\nCopy and Paste voice responses which is why I prefer detailed text responses from previous games than the dumbed down text there is now, 2 of the 4 options have a written response and the other 2 are response types such as Agree or Sarcastic but you don't even know what are the positive and negative replies which is not really acceptable for an RPG game. Several games from a few years earlier such as SWTOR also has this problem however The Witcher 3 a modern RPG game does not. You can't even do an evil playthrough anymore because there are no options to let you do this, this game is absolutely not even a basic RPG game anymore it is a FPS with some slight RPG elements.\nThe graphics are not "next-gen", definitely not good enough to warrant the amount of bugs and performance issues that the game has.\nThere are also way too many bugs and annoyances, I had less bugs in previous Bethesda games. I'll list just a few of them below;Freezing.\nCrashing.\nFPS is horrendous.\nEnvironment and NPCs popping in.\nInfinite / Extremely long loadscreens.\nInvisible Lockpicking Screen.\nDisappearing Weapon for about 5 - 20s whilst Weapon Swapping which can cause death.\nObjects, Enemies, Settlers, NPCs glitching through the floor or onto roofs and they also like flying.\nRandom Dialogue cut outs or people pushing the thing your talking to out of cut scene.\nSettlements randomly decreasing in happiness even when all their needs and more are fulfilled.\nThe UI is complete console garbage, why would I use a controller for a shooting game on the PC.\nStandard Bethesda Clipping.\n\nThe PC option menu is also horrendous for a AAA PC title lacking expected things such as Mouse Acceleration, FOV and even a colorblind mode. Smoothing Enabled? Really? I have to go into the ini file to change options, is this the 1990's?\n\nSome previous gameplay mechanics aren't there such as the Karma system, repairing is only for Power Armour now, no longer different versions of ammo and there is no longer a hardcore mode which has been replaced with varying levels of difficulties.\nThis is just another Bethesda game where they've slapped a few things onto their outdated engine to leave it for the modders and sold it again, since I thought Skyrim is Copy and Paste: The Game™ this is just a slightly improved version. This game does not have good enough RPG elements to say it is a good modern RPG game with the lack of any real choices in the game and the on rails main storyline and the game does not have good enough gun play to call it a good modern FPS/TPS game. The story is god awful and the fetch item, rescue my dog, kill ghoul copy and paste side missions don't make up for it. The user interface in general in every aspect of this game is a total hinderance and non-intuitive just like Skyrims was, but hey why improve anything when our slave modders will fix everything for free. The game lacks for a modern AAA title and performance wise can be summarised as a shoddy unoptimised console port.\nI know I won't be buying another Bethesda game again until I see some heavy engine improvements as I don't feel this game was up to par especially after playing other RPGs such as The Witcher 3 and Dying Light this year.\n\nTLDR - The game would have been good 5 years ago and it's a step forward gameplay wise atleast for Bethesda but this game does not compare to recent modern releases on the PC the past few years. This game is the absolute pinnacle of lazy development practices which should not be encouraged. Barebones Skeleton game with no flesh on it.","November 17, 2015","false","173.1"," 868 of 1,553 people (56%) found this review helpful 61 people found this review funny","56","868","1","61","42"

It's incredibly hyped up, and for good reason. It's a huge, incredibly dense world of action, drama, exploration and so much content it would keep you busy for weeks and weeks. But would I recommend it?\n\nI can't recommend a broken product. Unfortunately Fallout 4 suffers from the same bugs and issues that the last couple Fallouts and Skyrim suffered from. I lost my level 25 character to game corruption, restarted, got to about level 10ish and that save file got corrupted as well. I also had a couple instances of important npcs bugging out, saying their busy and never advancing the quest. I was also trapped in the crafting menu when i tried to back out of the Chemistry station too quickly, and navigating the clunky and counter-intuitive AI that is obviously designed for consoles becomes somewhat tiresome.\n\nAll in all, I'll be waiting a month or two for this game to be patched and fixed by Bethesda, as it suffered the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ launch that all their games do. I'll also be installing half a dozen mods to make the game more playable, such as a UI overhaul and more built-in options and tweaks. Once again, they spent too much time watering down the game for a more casual playerbase, taking many systems out of the players hands and at the same time designing the game to be more appropriate for consoles while neglecting the pc version.\n\nLost 2 playthroughs and salty about it.","November 14, 2015","false","125.2"," 171 of 298 people (57%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","57","171","298","5","0"

I am a sucker for RPG's with deep conversation systems and interesting stories. The Fallout franchise had previously been a pretty good source of this. Adventures with exciting twists and turns, interesting characters and naratives. It had it all. But then theres Fallout 4, and Fallout 4 is probably the most disappointing one in the series. Probably also the game I felt the most disappointed about in a while.\n\nThe main story is uninteresting, with boring plot points and even more boring characters. The lack of a indepth conversation system means that all of the main story as well as side quests usually are boiled down to accepting the quest, or not accepting it right now. There are very few arguments left in the game where you can persuade someone or convince them of doing something else. This utlimately means that the quests are incredibly bland straight forward things, with the main story especially being horrificly boring.\n\nYeah the shooting is better, and the settlement building is mildly interesting for a few hours (Until you reach the object cap, that is) and the world looks alright, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ this game is just so mindnumblingly robbed of any interesting details or plots. Not even the vaults strewn across the wasteland are that good, in fact some of them are downright boring and unoriginal.\n\nI think this will be the first bethesda game in a while where I stopped playing it, not because I was "done" or felt I had done everything fun, but because I was so unexceptionally bored with it.\n\nAlso can I just note that settlement building is attrociously boring when you actually figure out what the hell the point is. You go back to your settlement every once in a while and hope that your villagers don't berate you with inane requests as they slouch around and ♥♥♥♥♥ about stuff. Then you place another bed and suddenly everyone is back to their lines of "WORK HARD LIVE GOOD AMIRITE" over and over. Theres no depth, nothing interesting besides straight up window dressing. Yeah your sanctuary looks good, but is it actually meaningful? Does interesting stuff happen in that town? No.\n\nIn fact i'd like to argue that your houses in Skyrim were better, just because atleast in Skyrim I could put my stuff on display and have a nice armor/weapons room, but even that they have taken away.\n\nI give this game a 4/10 and a negative rating.","December 10, 2015","false","74.1"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","22","30","0","0"

Or even that it would just be like Fallout 3, which while actiony was still a good RPG.\n\nSadly, none of those things are the case. Bethesda did to Fallout what they did to the Elder Scrolls. They turned a once proud series of RPG's into a mindless action game. They essentially copied Skyrim but with even less roleplaying elements. This game is actually more of a streamlined mindless action game than Skyrim, if that's even possible to believe.\n\nThey completely gutted almost all of the compelexity and role-playing elements. There are no skill points in this game. Yes, you heard right. THERE ARE NO SKILL POINTS. Just let that sink in for a second. There is no repair system. No skills used in dialouge. In fact, there are hardly and soloutions to problems other than go in guns blazing and kill stuff. What New Vegas did amazingly well with multiple soloutions to quests and deep roleplaying elements that make the gameplay unique for your character...all of that is gone. There is a perk system but mostly all it does is allow you to choose stylistically the manner in which you will slaughter 5,000 enemies for the rest of the game. Yes, speech exists but it's pretty much useless. I've never been able to use it a meaningful way that helps me achieve a goal or beat a quest. It's completely superficial.\n\nThey also took out the karma system. You can no longer be evil. In fact, you aren't even allowed to choose evil or selfish options in quests. The choice just doesn't even exist. In fact, that's the other thing. There are no meaningful choices in this game other than "accept" or "deny" a quest, a quest which itself does not have multiple soloutions or options. You don't even get to control your own actions. How sad. This game is just so utterly bland and streamlined and simplified.\n\nThe story is pretty much non-existant. There's  kind of a logical, if not meaningful, story in the main questline but mostly the plot developements feel like excuses for the game to send you somewhere to kill some guys. This is even more apparant in the side quests. They have the most aboslutely hair thin plot lines that connect them (especially the railroad or minutemen quests) that are barely even coherent and logical. It's like the developers just sat down an came up with as many excuses as possible that might get someone to a new location to massacre more raiders. It reeks of minimal effort and laziness. In fact the faction sidequests literally repeat themselves, sending you to the same place to kill the same enemies twice. I've never seen a massive open world game that tricks you into thinking it's so full of content when actually it's so EMPTY. There's nothing interesting to do in this game. No interesting characters. No interesting dialouge. No role-playing.\n\nAnd I'm just getting warmed up here. There is a host of simple little things to critique about the game. Like for example, this game has a HUGE problem with transparency. It doesn't make the mechanics that clear at all, you don't know how that stats are being used. For example, the speech skill may seem to be a dice roll at first, but in actuallity its fixed. It's based on the color of the dialouge options. yellow = requires 3 charisma, orange = 6, and red = 9. This is just one example, but there are many others.\n\nThe game is also incredibly buggy. I won't even try to list all the bugs here because the list is so utterly massive. They include but are not limited to:\n-vats causing you to teleport\n-minimizing causing graphical errors\n-floating or naked people\n-one area being innaccessible because it instantly crashes your game and corrupts save files 90% of the time\nThis is simply an inexcusable amount of bugs, escpecially for a TRIPLE A TITLE THAT COSTS $60, of all things.\n\nI also have to critique the fact that the controls are totally changed around from the previous Fallout games. And a lot of times it's really not clear how to do something. For example, setting up supply lines between settlements is incredibly convoluted and complex and nowhere does it explain how to do it. This isn't the only thing, there's lots of them and the game does nothing to teach you about them.\n\nAnother super annoying thing is the dialouge. It's very unpredictable, you basically choose one of four options thats a really simplistic summary of what your character actually is going to say. So it ends up that you don't really know what you're picking and a lot of times your character says something you don't expect. Super frustrating. I guess they did this because "we don't want to upset the idiots who can't be bothered to read".\n\nAll in all this game is lacking on every front. No story, no emotion, no choice, no consequence, very streamlined and boring character development. It's a pure shooter game and not an RPG. Fallout is dead.","November 16, 2015","false","81.5"," 321 of 570 people (56%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","56","321","570","15","3"

Bethesda took absolutelly nothing from the master piece that was Fallout New Vegas, develloped by Obsidian. It's sad to see one of the best RPG franchised die and raise as an action adventure shooter game. Fallout should be an RPG first, meaning RPG aspect should be the meat and bone of the game. Dont get me wrong the game is still good for a adventure shooter, but if you want Fallout a post nuclear RPG, you will be disapointed.\n\nTHE BAD\n-Dialogue: Some says the dialogue is better than ever with the charcter voiced and all that. BUT IT'S NOT! it is lame and dull. you have only 4 choice that are always (up Question) (left Sarcastic) (right no) (down yes) Thats it. And no dialogue tree, no matter what you anwser the dialogue will always go the same way in a linear fashion. The voice of your character is not bad but there is no change of what he says or how he talk depending of your skills. So a 10 inteligence character will says the same thing and talk the same way as a 1 intelligence character, no skill base dialogue choice.\n\n-Choice: It's simple there is none, like in elder scolls, most quest only have one way to do it and it's always blast your way in the level and kill every moving creature. No moral dilema, no diplomacy, no sneak option, no nothing.\n\n-Character Developement: Alright every Fallout exept the two made by bethesda had: SPECIAL, SKILL, TRAITS, PERKS. now with Fallout 4 well you only have special and perks. pick a perk or a special every level until you have unlock everything.\n\n-Difficulty: the game do not offer hardcore mod...so you will end up with thousand of ammo in your inventory and hundred of stimpacks because they weigth nothing along with dozen of fusion core. the food in the game are only usefull for the settlement building. waiting and sleeping restor health and limbs, so stimpacks are useless. Invincible companion.\nStupid ennemy spawning system base on your level, oh yeah with legendary ennemy who loot better stuff, like a legendary radroach with a legendary piece of armor WTF! am I playing Fallout or Diablo???\n\nTHE GOOD\n-Crafting: The crafting system is good, Each weapon and armor have multiple option and with the layered armored system it get very interresting.\n\n-Visual: The graphics are better than ever, they look awsome, even if some says that they look bad for a "NEW GEN" I dont care they look really good. the only probleme I have with them so far is the baby toy color of some object but mods are available right now to fix these.\n\n-Combat: As a Hardcore fan of Fallout I dont think a good FPS gameplay ruin the game, I like it for the mechanic side, but the spawning of higher level ennemy ruin it all when it take you 20 bullet to kill another human.\n\nOverall if you dont know Fallout and adventure game are your style you will probably like the game, but for those who played Fallout from the start, it's a sad experience. Bethesda should sell the right to Obsidian like they did for New Vegas. Fallout 3 and Fallout 4 are my least favorite of the franchise and it's not because I hate bethesda, I do love skyrim and Morrowind, but they jsut dont get it for Fallout, they improved in the less important part at the cost of the most important.\n\n\n\n\n\n","November 13, 2015","false","38.6"," 128 of 222 people (58%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","58","128","222","7","0"

The game has been streamlined alot and has been turned into a shooter rather than a RPG.\n\nNearly all of the RPG elements are gone, the SPECIAL values are useless since you can increase them how you want and you don't really have to give them any thought, 90% of the perks are just damage increase for different weapon types.\nFurthermore the dialog design and the dialog options are really bad, your character is just a yes sayer. You're also forced in the role of the carrying parent with no chance to choose your own path.\nThe game also doesn't recognize your decisions in the ending cutscene, like it would be typical for a Fallout game, it's just a forgetable generic clip.\n\nThe story is most of the time forgetable and the choices you have for finishing it just decide which radiant quests you get in the end. Most of the time you feel like running errands even if you're a supposed to be the leader of a faction.\n\nThe world is okay, but often has copy and paste elements or feels.\n\nThe settlement system is okay, but besides some quests where you have to use it, it's nothing special, also the building often feels clunky and the UI is trimmed for console use, just like the rest of the controlls.\n\nThe gun modifications are nearly all the same just with different tiers and looks, they don't make the guns feel any different.

This is just a case of slapping a well known name on something to generate revenue. I don't know what the ♥♥♥♥ this poorly assembled, terribly optimized, crap pile is supposed to be, but it is not Fallout, it is not a RPG. I guess my biggest question to Bethesda is, in a game that you made soooooo linear how did you ♥♥♥♥ up he QA process so bad? There's less of a story choice here than Black Ops II!!!!

Jackson","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pulp-Friction/","193 products in account","A few good things to say about the game.. Unfortunately they're outweighed by the bad.\nStarters. The game is very poorly optimised. Off the bat it suggests Ultra for me, but as I finish character creation, the game stutters immensely.\nAlmost have 200 games in my library, none of them give my PC issues when playing on High/Ultra.\nNow I'm playing on a mish-mash of High, medium and Ultra, with tweaks to the games .ini file. Only pulling roughly 40-50 fps outside, and about 25 inside (what the ♥♥♥♥?).\nLooking past that as I explore the wastes, I come accross a blatant design flaw.\n90% of the buildings you find, you can't enter. Which really turns me off.\nBuildings are very sparse as is, but to run up, only to find they're boarded up, is a real ♥♥♥♥ing bummer.\nThey essentially took the Fo3 mod, which allowed settlements, and based Fallout 4 around it.\nGame pretty much throws this simplistic distraction at you.\nWhich is sad because the actual building aspect is lackluster and poorly done.\nWhat tutorial does exist, isn't any ♥♥♥♥ing help, once you get around to trying to build a settlement.\nWalls, floors and roofs don't exactly snap together either. The clipping is pretty gross.\nSome building items even have an unexplainable excess of "safe" area around them, that makes it even harder to align things. ♥♥♥♥ my OCD right in the face.\nThank the flying spaghetti monster, you can go into the console and disable the idiotic clipping.\nPlus you've got about 20 options for chairs, and 7 different options for lights.\n(More if you find Good Housekeeping magazines, doesn't matter in the long haul though, because the decent lights you can unlock, are broken and bugged when placed.)\n\nThe fact of the matter is the game pretty much screams..\n\nHERE, go build some ♥♥♥♥, and disregard the fact you can't truly explore the towns that do exist, in this tiny, sad excuse of a map, because they're boarded up.\nI guess as the bombs fell, the ones that didn't make into vaults, thought if they applied plywood to windows, that'd they'd be saved, rendering access to them, impossible.\nHuge missed oppurtunity to breathe life into the cityscape, by just leaving buildings inaccessible.\n\nV.A.T.S is a hot mess.\nMost the time my Criticals don't even register when they hit targets.\nIt actually results in ZERO damage dealt, with a loss to AP still. Damn, that's a nice addition.\n\nUsing the number keys to switch weapons, often causes the weapon to become unfireable/invisible.\nSeveral times now I've been killed by switching weapons, to just have animated hands spring up holding an invisible set of balls, and shaft.\nInstead of my gun.\nJust sitting there, groping invisible genitals.\n\nCan only imagine the amount of circle jerking going on when they spitballed ideas for this game.\nGuess the developers true feelings somehow bled into the game, with the whole invisible genitals bug.\nThey really ♥♥♥♥ed the pooch on this one.","December 3, 2015","false","274.3"," 67 of 112 people (60%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","60","67","112","9","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lmayyo/recommended/377160/","lmayyo","Jelly Croissant","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lmayyo/","452 products in account","I’ve decided to rewrite this review because I’ve played Fallout 4 more extensively and my opinion of it changed.  Steams stupidly small review length is why this doesn’t feel more fleshed out.  Sorry.\n\nThis is not a game for Fallout/RPG fans.  This is a game for people who don't care about either of them.\n\nI paid around 150 USD for this game and wanted to get my money’s worth.  Apparently this is not possible.  This is one of the most insulting video games I’ve ever played, and a slap in the face to anyone who has played a Fallout game before.  Bethesda decided to pander to the casuls who like the same generic garbage they got last time, instead of improving on their tired old formula.  Fallout 4 is not an RPG.  It’s not a Bethesda game.  It’s not a Fallout game.  It’s generic cliched FPS open world farcry shooting game #489, and it barely even works that way.\n\nDo you remember when Fallout games where RPG’s? Where your choices had a real effect on the world around you? Do you remember when the choices you made during gameplay actively affected quest lines and companion interactions? Do you remember when you could end a war with a tyrannous  faction using words and emotion rather than brute strength? Well, Bethesda decided to forget all of that.  There are no choices to make in Fallout 4.  All options eventually lead the same way.  You have absolutely no say in where the story goes, and this is made even worse with the addition of the dialogue wheel.  Each option: “YES”, “NO”, “SARCASTIC”, and “WHAT?” all mean yes in Bethesda’s eyes.  No matter what you choose, the game will FORCE you to play it the way it WANTS you to play it: As the good guy.\n\nEven worse, you can’t roleplay as YOUR character.  The character you play as already has a voice, a wife, a history, and a mission.  What’s the point of even letting us make our own character? We can’t be him.  We can’t make our own decisions because the game won’t let us.  There’s a reason why New Vegas’s story was so short, because it wasn’t important.  What was important was how YOU the PLAYER interacted with the world, and the main quest just showed  how the world would eventually end up due to your actions.  Your actions don’t mean ♥♥♥♥ in Fallout 4 despite the fact that the game forces you to make them.  Nothing you do has an effect on the world around you.  When the game tells you to help settlements, it will respawn enemies in the same place for you to kill all over again, so what’s the point?\n\nI didn’t mind the dialogue wheel at first.  I assumed Bethesda was making it easier for console players and controller users to make their selections easier during conversation.  Unfortunately, Bethesda ♥♥♥♥ed that up, and instead we get 4 options that are all the same.  And why are the explanations so short?  Why should I have to GUESS what MY CHARACTER is going to say.  What the hell does SARCASTIC mean?  Is that positive or negative? Am I going to be rude to them or make a joke? This would be a huge problem, unfortunately, the game doesn’t make what you said matter so it doesn’t mean anything in the end anyway.\n\nThe combat is fun at first glance.  But due to the fact that every quest is the same, “Go here.  Talk to someone.  Go there.  Talk to someone else.  Go there. Shoot things. Go back. Talk to the guy again.” , it gets monotonous very quickly.  It’s casualized to the point where it feels like Bethesda ripped ideas from other games instead of coming up with something unique and new.  Hitmarks, grenade prompts, orthodox sprint options, etc.  The game stops becoming fun when all you’re doing is the same thing over and over again.\n\nThe glitches and graphical options and slowdowns and poor performance don’t bother me that much.  What does bother me, is that people will defend ♥♥♥♥ for absolutely no reason, when there is nothing to like here.  Nothing new.  Nothing original.  Please don’t defend garbage like this because you don’t agree with my points.  Defend it when you can actually back them up.  This game is a letdown because it fell short of what was ALREADY ACHIEVED SEVEN YEARS AGO.\n\nThis game is a tragedy.  It makes me very upset to even think about it, because they hyped this game up so much.  They promised so much.  “No loading screens”, “Your choices matter”.\n\n“Their most ambitious RPG to date”.\n\nIt’s disappointing when you consider the fact that it took them 7 years to take something that was great and stripped everything that was great out of it and didn’t replace it with anything.  This is a framework.  There’s no substance here, no soul.  It doesn’t have staying power.  I can guarantee that if this game didn’t have the fallout title attached to it it would have disappeared into obscurity because there isn’t anything new here.\n\nIt’s the same ♥♥♥♥ we’ve been getting for years.  Please don’t buy into the hype.  It isn’t worth it.  It certainly wasn’t for me.\n\nI'll still play this game to fix and mod it, but in all honesty, I shouldn't have to do that.\n\nEDIT: To those of you complaining about my playtime, grow up.  It's extrememly rude and stupid of you to see my negative review and my playtime and then say "If it's so bad, why did you play it?"  Sure, let me just spend money on the game and then not ♥♥♥♥ing play it.  That seems like a great idea.\n\nNot only that, but I got a physical copy, and the game is tied to steam anyway so I couldn't even get a refund if I wanted to.  Use your brains, people.\n\nEDIT 2: Jesus christ does anybody even do research?  All you do is read the review and assume I'm some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ who doesn't like anything.  If any of you would start acting like Cireric or Mog or blue whale then we'd actually be having a discussion on the game instead of just starting flame after flame war over nothing.  The only time I've ever been insulting to anybody is when they are to me, and just looking at the comments will prove that.\n\nEDIT 3: Grey Man says I'm a stuck up nerd.","November 18, 2015","false","93.4"," 1,887 of 3,411 people (55%) found this review helpful 207 people found this review funny","55","887","3","207","597"

I'm going to avoid talking about the story since I haven't seen enough of it to judge it. I will update it if as I continue I come across anything that changes my mind or that needs to be corrected.\n\nPROS\nLOOT UI : The fact that this is my favorite part of the enitre game so far should speak volumes alone. This game has by far the best loot window UI I have ever seen. Nice, clean and minimalistic. Which is odd considering how unorganized and messy the rest of the UI is.\n\nNO FREEZE TIME IN VATS : This basically just makes the game a little harder. You can no longer freeze time when an enemy is about to attack you to get a quick shot on them and run away usncaved.\n\nMIDDLING (leaning towards cons)\nWEAPONS AND ARMOR MODDING : I would've listed these as pro's because they are vital to the game and although the game does a terrible job of streamlining the process (UI is terrible in the modding menus's) I still feel these systems are good. The reason I'm not listing these as pros is because other games did it better. Much MUCH better. Specifically MGSV and Witcher 3. MGSV has literally the exact same weapons parts swapping/modding system with even more customizable options and parts to choose from and a much cleaner easier to use UI in a much simpler system over all that is more complex in options but easier in accessability. Witcher's armor crafting system with normal to mastercrafted has essentially the same pros of MGSV's system over Fallouts. Not to mention Fallout had a higher budget, and more experience in open world games that both of those competitors that came out this year.\n\n4 DIALOGUE OPTIONS : I don't have anything particularly wrong with this other than it's just cut down from FO3. If they wanted the dialogue UI to be better, they achieved that, but at the cost of actually having lots of dialogue for the player to get into. Sometimes it's even less than 4 options, not literally but think about it this way: The option to the right is always a mean option, players who aren't going to be mean literally only have 3 options to choose from. When there is a chance to use charisma to get extra dialogue, players who haven't invested points into charma's speech options will be cut down ever further. The system is cut to begin with, then the game cuts the options down even further.\n\nCONS\nSETTLEMENT SYTEM : It's literally a chore that offers no worthwhile benefit. It's like they put this in the game just to say that they have a base building mechanic. As far as I can tell, the only pro to maintaning a settlement is that you will get traders, well, why waste hours trying to build it, then have to maintain it to keep the citizens happy otherwise the trader's won't want to trade, when I can just go to diamond city and have access to every trader I need. Not to mention crafting all the things you need to keep the settlers happy costs a lot of materials, materials that you could use to enhance weapons and armor that is actually much much more important and useful than this useless mechanic. Also the UI is awful again.\n\nPOWER ARMOR SYSTEM : This may come down to opinion but using power armor almost feels like a chore. In order to use it you have to find fusion cores which aren't common at all and you have to stop what you're doing and go to wherever you last left your armor suit, put the core in, then go back to whatever you are doing. May not sounds like much and it really honestly isn't but I never felt like "oh I should get my power armor". It almost feels like the game doesn't want you to use it, which is fine because if you used it a lot the game would be too easy, but it's such an iconic piece of fallout that it really should've been integrated better. Having it actually be armor like in FO3 I think was much better. Also customizing it seems completely useless to me when it's already strong to begin with and I can use those crafting materials to make better weapons/armor which are world's more useful.\n\nCOMPANIONS : Used 4 of them so far, just get the perk where you take less damage if you don't use them and be happy. They are literally stimpak eaters.\n\nGRAPHICS : Don't need to go in detail for this one, I play the game with all settings maxd (motion blur off) at 1440p and character models and tons of the game's textures look incredibly dated. Yes it matters, stop lying to yourself.\n\nANIMATIONS : Character's movement, lip syncing and faces are just bad. Just bad. Nothing more to add really other than there are re used animations from skyrim here and there.\n\nPERFORMANCE : There aren't really lany performace issues per se (other than the forrest around sacntuary during the day, frames drop to around 25 FPS with 2x780s and a 5820k and yes I enabled SLI and modded it work) but the reason I'm listing this as a con is because for the size of this map, and the incredibly dated visuals, the game has no excuce to run poorly at all under any cirumstances anywhere on the map. I can run withcer 3 and MGSV both maxed out at 1440p with no issues but this has me dropping frames every now and then for some reason. It's also hard capped at 60fps due to the garbage engine the game runs on. Uncapping it in the INI files will ♥♥♥♥ up your game's physics/cause crashes so beware.\n\nBUGS : Tons of them. Not all game breaking. But I've had to load a save 3 times now in order to continue because my game or character got stuck. I've played over 100 hours of witcher and had to load a save 1 time. Over 400 of MGSV and I've never had to load a save. "B-b-b-b-but It's just classic Bethesda!" Ok so as long as your name is Bethesda you can release a really buggy game and everything will be Ok. Did people forget that bugs and performance issue is what got Batman removed from the ♥♥♥♥ing steam store?\n\nGUN PLAY AND MOVEMENT : This might come down to opinion as well but controlling your character feels extremely sluggish and unresponsive. Fallout's gunplay has always been off, and it may be intentional, but I thought the addition of ADS would fix this. Well it doesn't, countless times I've been aiming right at someone or something and I miss. "B-b-b-b-b-but it's part of fallout's charm!" Ok well if being one hit away from dying and no way to restore your health when the enemy is so close to death and you take the shot to kill the enemy but it misses even though they were right in front of you and you aimed right at them and it ends up getting you killed and loading a save for 40 minutes ago is very fun to you then yeah! It's part of it's charm! Also not to mention ammunition is scarce so shots that should be hits missing is just a useless thing to have, if it's intentional that is.","November 11, 2015","false","47.9"," 25 of 36 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","25","36","0","2"

Fallout 4 is the type of child that looks adventurous, intelligent, intuitive, innovative, and outgoing. However, when Fallout 4 invites you to play at his/her house for the evening Fallout 4 only wants to do one thing, one way, all afternoon.\n\nIn other words Fallout 4 lacks the creative depth of previous Fallout games, though it tries to mask it with an amazing Character creator, civilization simulator, and modification system. Fallout 4 is never concerned with approaches to situations other than to point and shoot, and every level seems to be a grind to dealing more damage or sustaining more damage through Perks.\n\nIf you are looking for a role playing game it is probably best to try one of Fallout 4's older siblings.","January 29","false","71.1"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","20","27","0","0"

Iron sights and enemy tracking are added.\nVATS isn't a one-click-shoot mechanic anymore.\n4 factions that tie in with the main quest.\nBuild your own settlements / villages.\nYou can command your companions to shoot targets, pick locks / hack computers / open doors.\nPerks (character leveling bonuses) are fairly balanced.\nCompanions have immersive reactions to your actions, and aren't mindless puppets.\nNo crashes.

Legendary weapons are randomly spawned.\nAlmost no unique dialogue, which has been converted to a 4-line only dialog system.\nYou are required to join atleast 2 of the 4 factions to end the main quest.    Not all armors are compatible with the advertised armor-addon system.

Definitely an improvement compared to Fallout 3 but as good as Fallout: New Vegas. The main problem is\nthe lack of interesting factions. At some point in the storyline I was forced to choose a side but I couldn't. I couldn't choose because no faction was unique/new enough and with good motives to make we want to join it.\n\nDialogues and Voice acting: Good. The voice acting is a huge step forward compared to all the previous Bethesda titles and most of the characters are well written. The new cinematic camera helps a lot to make each conversation worth to hear, this is the first Bethesda title that I didn't skip any conversation parts.\n\nQuests: There are dozens of unique and interesting quests and a fair number of choices to be made. Overall I believe that, as most Bethesda games, Fallout 4 has the following problem -> quantity over quality. There are tons of filler quests and they hide the good ones, that's a big problem.\n\nGameplay: Really good for an action game, not that good for an rpg. The gunplay, if you consider Fallout 4 an action game with rpg elements, is excellent. The only things holding it back are the AI (still better than previous Fallout games AI) and the thematic yet boring pipe weapons. But, if you expect an rpg combat system when buying Fallout 4 you will be dissapointed. The streamlining of the leveling up system, that was in my opinion neccesary to change the gunplay, leaves a lot to be desired and 'nerfs' the rpg element of the combat system that the previous Fallout games had.\n\nAudio: Excellent. The sound effects are really good, but the highlight is the music. The music is excellent, truly excellent.\n\nOverall: A great game to buy if you like action games with rpg elements. On the other hand if you are looking for an rpg you should probably take a look at Fallout: New Vegas because Fallout 4 doesn't have quite a few things that qualify a game as an rpg (in it's true sense).","March 30","true","29.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","11","11","0","5"

However this is yet another game that proves that Bethesda knows game engines and in-game physics, but not how to write a damn story.\n\nPros:\n-Pretty graphics\n-Hey, it's a post-apocalyptic RPG\n-Cool weapons system, you will often find yourself switching between different types of weapons depending on the fight (sniper rifle to semi auto to full auto as the range changes)\n-Makes power armor its own gameplay style and it's pretty fleshed out as a way of fighting\n\nCons:\n-Horrible writing.\n-Bland two dimensional characters and transparent motivations.\n-Overly simplistic gameplay (how do you solve that? you shoot it!)\n\n-Aggrivatingly wimpy protagonist and non descript dialogue tree. (There was a guy being a ♥♥♥♥ to my character and one of my dialogue options just said "offended" so I thought to myself "yeah, I'm offended" and selected it, expecting my character to be a badass and get angry. Instead, I was disgusted when my character gave this weak little smile and went "I'm sorry, have I offended you in some way? Maybe we got off on the wrong foot.") Terrible!\n\n-Over emphasis on crafting. You spend so much of your time "looting" ovens and other household items, getting encumbered, then slowly lugging your things back to your base. You lose a bunch of game time and a bunch of playtime just going back and forth carrying loot and crafting instead of solving quests.\n\n-Nothing really happens without the character being "ready" for it. You seek out pretty much everything, almost nothing just happens on its own. It really reinforces the notion that you're playing a video game because the world is incredibly predictable and stolid.\n\n-Settlements. ♥♥♥♥ off with the god damn settlements already. I thought building one base was okay. I have no interest in being a full time land surveyor.\n\n-Aside from being wimpy, the protagonist is an idiot. The intro shows his son being taken and then him RE-ENTERING cryosleep after he witnesses that. Yet afterwards he is searching around asking people about a baby, somehow not connecting being in cryosleep with the passage of time. Everyone knows that his son will be an adult by the time he meets him yet Bethesda seems to think this is going to be some kind of unexpected reveal because they can't write worth a damn.\n\n-It's post-apocalyptic but hardly feels that way. There's not a lot of unique ways of living or a whole lot of freedom. It's much closer to the wild west. You have your law-abiding people, you have your outlaws, you have a few powerful factions of people who have access to better weaponry and resources than the general populace. Most things are solved by gunfights, towns are safe, outside of towns are not at all.\n\nIf you're a fan of post-nuclear games, sure buy it because who doesn't like roaming around in that environment? Don't buy it for the 1 bajillion dollars it currently costs though. The best game in the Fallout series is Fallout: New Vegas. If you want a post-nuclear RPG that's actually got some story to it that will keep you interested, buy that game instead. The only reason this game sold as many copies as it did was because they made an exceptionally good commerical and aired it everywhere and cashed in on the Fallout name. If this game had been made by an Indie company without a marketing department, it wouldn't have sold more than 100,000 copies.","May 11","false","40.1"," 17 of 22 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","17","22","0","0"

Yes. Is it a good Fallout game? No.\nI've come to expect something of Fallout games and Bethesda's take on them. Fallout 4 is just a huge uneeded change to an established system.\nYeah, Fallout 3 had a backstory, but you would get so lost in the game you could forget about your dad and the vault or even just say "♥♥♥♥ you dad, I'm gonna blow up towns and ♥♥♥♥ over humanity you ♥♥♥♥♥♥". In this game your just this constantly concerned dad who can't stop babbling on about his "military experiance".  God, don't even get me started on your wife/husband and son. The introduction is so rushed; I have no emotional attachment to my family even if I wanted to.\nNo karma system whatsoever, not even Fallout 3's primitive system. Oh yeah, you get companion relationships which are pretty much ♥♥♥♥ing useless.\nDialogue is just plain ♥♥♥♥ed. I thought the voice acted protaganist would work, and it does to a degree, but it really just sucks the fun of being your own character. The diolouge wheel is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and gives me no idea of what I'm about to say, but there's a mod that fixes that so I really can't complain to much. But Jesus ♥♥♥♥ing Christ, why? WHY?! FOUR DIALOGUE OPTIONS? And half the time it's, Yes, No, Sarcasm, What? Thanks Bethesda for the riveting conversations in-game. It makes absoutely no sense. I never feel like I'm in control, all the diologue usually just gives you the same response from the NPC, no matter what. No intresting speech checks from having a high repair, medicine,barter,explosives, low/high intelligence, low/high strength or special perks like in previous games, nope. Just a yellow, orange and red speech check. Wow.\nThat brings me to skills and leveling which has been completely castrated. No making some cool ♥♥♥ stealth character or a handyman with high repair and lockpicking, nope. Just some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ perks. Did Bethesda honestly think that I chose Confirmed Bachelor for the 5% extra damage against women and not the special speech checks? At least lockpicking and terminal hacking are still there, but it's not like Fallout 3 or NV where you would spend your points wisely and try as hard as you can to either max out lockpicking or hacking. Now you can do that in 6 levels. Yeah. You literally get handed special points so just have fun having a maxed out special character by level 20. None of the perks are really that intresting or what we were asking for: Less statistical perks, more visable perks and new abilities.\nBOS, Super Mutants and Enclave are thrown in cuz' ♥♥♥♥ lore. we're Bethesda. Honestly kind of bugs me they put them in there for no reason even though it defies the lore to the max. New England was an un-tapped resource they could have utilized and made brand new factions. We get one new faction, The Minutemen which pretty much suck ♥♥♥ because it's just some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and a bunch of crusty, STD infested settlers.\nCombat is nice, pretty much where it should be, same for graphics. Map is nice size, so far I've seen TONS of content and I think modders should help with that tremendously. Crafting is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic, I love it probably the best new addition to the game even with the small gun variation pool. Settlement building is meh.\nI don't think Fallout 4 would have ever lived up to it's hype, regardless of how good it was. The wait was so long and Fallout 3 and NV were two unbeatable games. Loved those games, loved the lore, loved the atmosphere and loved the flaws. Fallout 4 is a good game, but an awful Fallout game.","December 29, 2015","false","41.8"," 73 of 124 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","73","124","3","7"

4\nOur Group Page\nReviewer        Hours played                Scarecrow        142\n\nLet's begin\nAlso, I'm sorry for anyone whom got the ending spoiled before the game came out, but at that point It was a bit obvious considering the whole opposite ends comparison from Fallout 3.\nSo, I'll be putting the whole story section wrapped around In a Spoiler tag, Incase you want a review, but nothing related to the story, so you can experience It for yourself.\n\nSection 1: Story (Intro)\n\n\nWaking up for the first time, you noticed a few strange figures walk into your field of view; confused, possibly scared, you watch on as they release your wife/husband from their chamber.\nYou can only watch on In horror, and anger as one of the figures shoots your wife/husband In the chest, Instantly killing them.\nThey approach the glass window of your chamner, and proceed to call you The Backup.\n\nYou're then frozen on Ice again for who knows, and the manuual override Is finally released allowing you to finally leave your confinements.\nAlarms are going off, everyone Is dead, and the only choice you have Is to get out of there, or keep exploring and finding out what the heck happened like myself.\nSoon, you're faced with giant cockroaches, or Radroaches, which try and attack you on sight; you fend them off and finally get to the Vault Entrance.\nYou find a nearby device on the ground attached to the skeleton of a dead scientist, strange and foreign, and not knowing what It would evendo, you see It as your only way out.\n\nExiting the vault, you see that your entire world Is in ruins, destroyed, and there's radiation and skeletons to be seen everywhere.\nIn the distance, you see your home, Sanctuary, and begin to find out what happened while you were away.\nSection 1: Story (Ending Branches)\n\nThe linear endings are probably what most people were mad about, that or the numerous bugs that Bethesda, or modders have yet to finish In their long run.\n\nYou're given 4 choices, on how you want the story to play out:\n\nA) Join The Brotherhood of Steel\nThis one Is pretty obviouus, given The Brotherhood wasn't always subtle on their true intentions.\nYou're tasked to wipe out The Railroad, and The Institute with the help of Liberty Prime.\n\nB) Join The Railroad\nJust like The Brotherhood ending, except you're tasked with becoming The Director of The Institute, and helping as many Synths as possible to escape the comfounds of The Institute.\nAt some point In time, you will have to fight, and drive back The Brotherhood of Steel, since they see The Railroad as a threat.\n\nC) Join The Institute\nYou soon learn after helping Father, that he Is dying of an aggressive form of cancer, and wants you to take his place.\nNot everyone Is pleased with this decision, but you'll soon earn their trust by destroying the Brotherhood of Steel, and The Railroad.\nYou'll hijack Liberty Prime, and order him to destroy The Prydwin, which results In you having full control over the Institute, as the new acting Director.\nIt's to be noted, that a lot of your companions will hate you after this, giving a speech and asking as to why you decided to go with The Institute, they'll continue as normal after this, so you won't have to worry about not playing the endgame, If you choose to.\n\nD) Raid The Institute with The Minutemen\nThis one Is kind of a neutral party, besides having to bombard The Brotherhood with artillery shells, and also gives the most freedom when It comes to the fate of The Commonwealth.\nYou'll have to restore the minutemen to gain this option.\n\nSection 2: Gameplay\nSome, to Most would say that this Is a bad game, and In all due to respect there's a lot worse out there, but the fact Is I'm not actually trying to defend the quality of the game when It comes to this.\nSure, this game has Its Bugs, Glitches, and even mechanics that people wouldn't find fitting, but that still doesn't make It a Bad Game, not even close.\nAs for being a bad Fallout game, you'd have to not be accepting of this new change, or be out of your gourd considering what they put Into this game In the first place.\n\nLet's discuss the new feature sthat Bethesda has brought to the table:\n\n1) Voiced Protagonist |\nObviously this one had to make It to the list, and I for one don't really find this to be a bad thing.\nSure, without a voice you'd be able to pretend that the Lone Survivor Is actually you, but I see It as just a Mass Effect approach to the whole thing.\nNow, one can argue that there's no spaceships, and Commander Shephard definately Isn't In this game, but think of It like this:\n\nMass Effect: You choose what your character says through various options of dialogue, and shape their story.\nFallout 4: You choose what your character Is name, what they say through various options of dialogue, and shape their story.\n\nIt's also to be mentioned, that Falloutu 4 also Isn't as linear as Mass Effect, but they're both still pretty enjoyable games In that remark.\n\n2) Settlement Building |\nThis Is one of the biggest features mentioned, and shown In the E3 presentation, and I find this quite enjoyable.\nSure, It could be compared to some sort of management sim, but In that aspect It honestly Isn't even one In the first place.\nThink of It like a slightly more simpler Fallout Shelter, which of course Is exactly what this Is, besides managing your own vault, you manage an entire settlement instead.\nThe Size Limit would be the biggest Issue with this, but there's always ways to avoid this.\nResources can be a pain to get, but other than that the whole system just seems a bit too limited at times, and I just wish that there were more options.\n\n3) Weapon Modification |\nOne of the coolest features about this game, allowing you a sense of making your own weapon with various mods, changing both the appearance, elemental damage, and even damage and recoil.\n\n4) Companion Interaction |\nThe way they react to the environment, and others Is remarkable.\nNoticing things, your actions, and other objects and people around them and being able to talk to them, or do things with them Is one of the features that I really enjoy.\n\n5) Perks, over Skill Points |\nI noticed that a lot of people were complaining about Skill Points being taken away, but let me just ease your mind with this:\n\nFor one, you're able to use any weapon you want now, regardless, considering that there's no skill points system.\nIt also doesn't matter what level you are now, and the gear you're given, and perks determine If you're able to take down an enemy.\nAnd finally, It really balances out everything, giving you control wether you're able to do something or not.\nRegardless, I still find this a step up, than anything else.\n\nAnd that's about It.\nTo truly see If you'll enjoy the game or not, I'd recommend actually trying It If you get the chance, you may or may not regret that decision, but you won't know until you buy the game.","November 17, 2015","true","492.8"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","23","33","2","0"

It's worth the purchase price, to be sure, but it's not quite what I was expecting or hoping for in a Fallout title.  If you like GTA or FarCry, you'll probably like this.  If you're into real RPGs and making choices and seeing the results of those choices, or building nuanced, different, interesting characters, skip it.\n\nSo I started playing the Fallout series with 3.  Someone bought the game for me and I loaded it up and I was astonished that I got to live out a video game childhood and then I got set loose on an entire living world full of people that I could either help or hinder, or even ignore.  It was great, but after that initial rush was over, and after the first play-through, I never went back because it suffered from the blandness that Bethesda is now kind of notorious for.\n\nAlong comes New Vegas, and, after the technical stuff was fixed, it became my favorite RPG of all time.  That world was alive.  The things you did for and to people mattered.  The world gave you feedback based upon what you did.  It felt very real, particularly on the first play-through.  it was a deep and complex game that I really cared about.  Every character was different, and you could really play nuanced individuals and the whole world would feel just a little different to you every time you did that.  It felt like an RPG with fairly good shooter mechanics layered on.\n\nSo out comes Fallout 4.  I was initially so excited because my most recent memories of the series were of New Vegas.  I wanted to feel invested in a game world again.  Unfortunately, it feels more like a dumbed-down, first-person shooter version of Fallout 3.  It's a shooter with some VERY meager RPG elements layered on.  It honestly feels more like GTA V than a Fallout game.  You walk around and look at things, and you get spoon fed a little backstory and atmosphere from the world, but it's such a light touch and it feels like you're riding a ride that every other person who bought the game is on.\n\nDon't get me wrong.  The world is massive and somewhat dynamic.  The art direction is beautiful.  The voice acting is actually pretty good most of the time (I was afraid it would be terrible, given Bethesda's history, but it wasn't).  I haven't had a lot of technical problems.  This is probably the most stable Bethesda release ever.  The game makes a FANTASTIC first impression, and without giving any spoilers, you do make an emotional connection with your character and his or her family in the beginning.  In the first few hours, you really feel like it's going to be the best game you've ever played.\n\nThat fades really fast, though, as you realize that this gigantic, meticulously created world is basically just a big place full of things to shoot, and people who want you to shoot things.  I found this note on a super-mutant.  It said something like "kill, loot, return."  That pretty much sums the game experience up fairly well.  I stock on on supplies, I go out into the city, I find places on the map, read a terminal or two, pick a lock, and then kill the things that are there.  There are a few decent character based quests that I've come across, but nothing like what I experienced in New Vegas.  This is the standard 'new' Fallout formula, which is fine, but in this game it's like they spent all their time recording dialogue and very little effort went into actually creating stories, and more importantly, tying those stories together into some kind of cohesive whole that gives feedback based upon the player's actions.\n\nThe settlements feature is cool, but it feels mechanically useless most of the time, and its features are kind of poorly fleshed out.  Honestly, I'd rather have well-realized towns with interesting people to meet and choices to make that actually matter.  I think providing one or two settlement spaces tied extensively to the story would have been a better way to handle this feature, instead of many locations that are just bland tickboxes.\n\nThey built a really neat, beautiful world.  They provided the terminals and the scenery and the setting for post-nuclear Boston.  The stage was set masterfully.  Then it kind of feels like they created one adventure on rails and everyone experiences that (you can be either good, good sarcastic, or evil... which is just terrible for an RPG... there seems to be no grey area).  Even the way the leveling works kind of funnels you to certain locations before others, so no more deciding where you're going to go because it feels like your character would go there.  You get on the 'Mass Effect' like ride, complete with dialogue wheel (sigh, it's as terrible and predictable as it sounds) and you do basically the same thing every other player is doing.\n\nIt's a solid, good, and even fun game.  I don't think I've felt more conflicted about a game in a long time, and this is after eagerly waiting for YEARS for news about it.  I'm not recommending it, though, because pretty much everyone playing a Fallout game nowadays expects a Fallout game, and this just feels kind of like GTA V without cars or some Bioware title where you are on rails most of the time.\n\nAfter the masterpiece, work of art, splendid RPG that was New Vegas, this just feels very bland, on rails, and poorly fleshed-out.   After all the waiting and the hype and the expectation that they would evolve more than just the technical aspects of the engine, and actually provide a deeper RPG expereince alongside the better shooting mechanics, it kind of feels like a bit of a disappointment.\n\nI won't be buying anymore of their RPGs until I read a lot of player reviews, because they seem to be heading in the dumbing-down, mass market, pretty colors / big explosions / be the hero design direction.  If you're into that kind of game, that's fine.  Enjoy them.  Fallout 4 just doesn't give me the same feeling I got in Vault 101 or, even more so, as the Courier, though.  I always feel too constrained, or like if they had simply tried a little harder, a good quest, npc, location, or DECISION, could have been better and felt more real to me as the player.  It feels like a gigantic, dense, pretty world filled with those animatronic people you see on amusement park rides… most of whom you just shoot at.\n\nIt's just flat, on-rails melodrama, most of the time.  After like 50 hours I really don't care where my son went or whether Mama Murphy takes drugs or not.  I didn't want to play as a guy with a son.  I don't want to wander the wasteland looking for a son.  Even if I did, the game pacing is just... wrong... for this kind of story.  Is this an RPG or a network made-for-TV movie?  It started out fine, but the forced emotional, on-rails trope gets old fast.\n\nIt starts out feeling amazing, and the longer you play the more you really start to see its shortcomings.\n\nThat being said, there is a lot of content and it's great for killing some time.  The shooting mechanics are alright, although the enemies are bullet-sponges on anything above normal, so it feels very arcade-y and a bit dumb.\n\nI regret buying the strategy guide.  I think I've used it once, to figure something out with power conduits in the settlements.  I'll probably give it to someone for Christmas, and that right there pretty much tells me how I feel about this entry in the series… Wow I'm depressed now.  Sad Vault Boy is sad (and I'm wearing a Vault Boy t-shirt right now, which should give you a hint how much I have loved the series in the past).\n\nI feel like Bethesda let the RPG portion of its fan base down with this title.  I feel like they dumbed the game down substantially.  I feel like they want sales over substance.  I don't like how they treated the gaming press with that 'embargo of an embargo' thing.  I think it's bad when game developers become icon / rock star archetypes because this kind of thing seems to inevitably happen to the product over time… So yeah…  End wall of text.","December 4, 2015","false","79.2"," 102 of 177 people (58%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","58","102","177","5","0"

I am not going to write a lot but will mention all important parts. I am a great fan of Fallout universe so I will analyze this game as  a part of the UNIVERSE\n\nThings that I liked\n- Really nice graphic. Despite the fact that fallout is using old engine the picture is nice by itself and as a fan of the Universe I like it. We were not expecting great graphic. This game is not about it.\n- guns. I really enjoyed the process of upgrading my guns. It was interesting and each gamer can create his unique gun, which will perfectly fit his style of game.\n- gunfights. Bethesda did great work on improving the gunfights. Each fight with different enemies was interesting.\n- nice locations. Despite the fact that there are not a lot of unique and big locations they are in general nice, full of colors and people, who do their job.\n\nUnfortunately there are no more big positive aspects of this game\n\nThings that I dislike\n-  DIALOGS  OMG Bethesda why you did this awful step back?! If you are a new one and Fallout 4 is your first Fallout series game than it is fine. But if you have played FO 1,2,3 and NV Than you will see that the dialog system in Fallout 4 is  Bull**t  REALLY BAD. We don't need the voices of main characters. We were OK with silence Main characters. You sacrificed the option to communicate and make real choice just to hear what your character say. It is so awful that I can speak with 1% of commonwealth. Yes/No/Sarcasm/Maybe answers do not fulfill our needs. To tell the truth it is the worst thing in game.\n- a lot of NPCs cannot be killed. Minor thing\n- armor system is useless. A lot of similar parts. Nothing unique like the ranger armor in NV. Major thing\n- PipBoy. very strange menu. Took a lot of time to get used to it after perfect Fallout 3\NV PipBoy\n- NPC SPAWN. Are you serious? I was playing Destiny or Fallout 4? It is nice that yoy improved the process of gunfights but OMG why you created a spawn??? MAAAJOR THING\n- Small map. You added a lot of similar locations and there was nothing interesting. Even Diamond City( like the biggest location) looked like Megaton LOL.\n- Awful missions. Almost all side missions are stupid. They are like GO AND KILL. What were you thinking about, Bethesda? Not interesting at all\n\nConclusion If  you haven't played Fallout before than after playing Fallout 4 you will give this game 8-9/10\nIf  you are a fan of Fallout series than you will give 5/10\nWhy 5? Play Fallout New Vegas and you will understand why. It was much better. I think that Obsidian (  the company, which created Fallout New Vegas and in which worked people that created original Fallouts  ) knows how to make Fallout games better than Bethesda.\n\nDon't judge me strictly. I am a great fan of Fallout and I am deeply upset with the fourth part. But for New people this game is perfect. It has everything to attract person which is unfamiliar with Fallout universe.\n\nSorry for my bad english\n\nХотел давно написать отзыв про эту игру но думал, что сюжетная линия дополнит картину. Я большой фанат вселенной Fallout и соответственно буду анализировать игру с точки зрения фаната серии а не человека, который знает про эту серию игр только играя в 4 часть.\n\nПлюсы\n- Хорошая графика. Для ценителей вселенной графика никогда не была очень сильным показателем и несмотря на старый движок картинка в игре вполне красивая и динамичная.\n- Пушки. система крафта меня очень порадовала. Каждый человек в этой игре может создать уникальное оружие, которое подойдет под ваш стиль игры.\n- Перестрелки. Разработчик игры постарался на славу и улучшил процесс перестрелок и боев.\n- хорошие локации. Несмотря на то, что в игре не так уж много интересных локаций они наполненные красками и некоторые даже людьми, которые воистину оживляют локации.\n\nК сожалению на этом плюсы закончились\n\nМинусы\n-  Диалоги  . ОМГ Бесезда, как можно было так запороть с диалогами??? Это ужасный шаг назад. Если вы раньше не играли в игры вселенной, то еще пол беды. Но если вы играли хотя б во что-то, то вы поймете, что в четвертой части диалоги откровенно ужасные. Никому не нужен озвученный главный герой. Нам игралось хорошо и с тихоней. Вы пожертвовали возможностью общаться и делать реальный выбор( что делает эту игру РПГ) только ради того, чтобы мы могли услышать голос ГГ. ДА-Нет-Возможно-Сарказм - это не то, что удовлетворит наши потребы в РПГ!\n- многие персонажи не могут быть убитыми\n- система брони бесполезная. Очень много одинаковых частей брони. нету ничего уникального как в Нью вегас с броней Рейнджера НКР.\n- ПипБой. Очень странно переработанное меню. Пришлось долго привыкать. В нью Вегас и в 3 части было намного лучше.\n- Спавн врагов? Вы серьезно? Я играл в Дестини или в Фоллаут 4? Очень хорошо, что систему боев вы улучшили но спавн зачем добавлять лол.\n- Маленькая карта. Очень много одинаковых локаций, которые вообще не интересные. главный город Даймонт Сити Размером с Мегатонной из Фоллаут 3. Печально и не интересно.\n- УЖАСНЫЫЫЕ МИССИИ. Почти каждая миссия это ПОЙДИ УБЕЙ. Очень неинтересный сюжет и побочные миссии. Возвратились В фоллаут 3. В Нью Вегас намного интересней.\n\n\nВЫВОДЫ Если вы новенький, то игра вам очень понравиться и я рекомендую поиграть 8-9 из 10\nЕсли вы фанат серии, то поставите игре 5 из 10. Почему 5? Поиграйте в Fallout New Vegas и вы всё поймете. Я думаю, что Обсидианы( создатели Нью Вегас) намного лучше бы сделали четвертую часть.\n\nНе судите строго и извините за плохой русский","November 15, 2015","false","55.2"," 283 of 508 people (56%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","56","283","508","6","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shakabra/recommended/377160/","shakabra","shakabra","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shakabra/","175 products in account","This is a hypocritical review, and I am mostly contradicting myself, considering the hour count I have laid into this game, but I feel like I need to vent on why this game is mediocre in contrast to something vastly superior in the past (FO3 FO:NV). And it is long as ♥♥♥♥ so bear with me.\n\nThe majority of folks get the idea of the story, post apocalypse, wasteland wandering, blah blah blah, if you have no idea what the Fallout universe is about, you are probably living under a rock. My main gripes with this game isnt even  the main quest and storyline being boring, weak and not up to scratch from the previous game (New Vegas), If anything, it is the overall dumbing down of the whole RPG mechanics and system, ranging from dialogue branches (WHICH ♥♥♥♥ING MATTER IN MY FALLOUT GAME) to the lack of a karma system. These components made you feel like you were self inserted into the story and not coming from some kind of outside third person feeling. Fallout games are meant to be IMMERSIVE. A lot of people commend this tradeoff for a better and more fluent combat system, which is absolutely absurd, because the mixture we get with this is a Borderlands-esque feeling of looting, shooting, pillaging and dialogue being uninteresting or just comedic value alone.\n\nThat is Borderlands, not Fallout. Roleplaying is out of the question for me in this game, mainly because the character is voice acted by strictly 2 people based on gender, and for me that just kills an RPG in general unless the character has developed and made attributes beforehand, such as the Witcher games. In this case, why not just make the character be somebody, and not self inserting yourself with a generic voice? It feels like a Mass Effect role, which for me really killed the feeling of enjoyment in dialogue. Mind you the ACTUAL main gripe with dialogue overall is how dumbed down and simplistic the choices and things you can say are.\n\nThe game will give you objectives and quests where people simply say something along the lines of "Help out settlement is under attack!" which your 5 main responses will be:\n\n"Anything I can do to help?"\n"Relax, I got this, point the way."\n"If you need help, all you gotta do is ask."\n"Sarcastic"\n"I am going somewhere else"\n\nThese branches will become the main crossroads and heart of the dialogue choices. Yes choices will differ slightly depending on the quest of course, most from the main quest. However the sidequests, which compared to Obsidian's Fallout games, are the heart and soul of the game and hold the games up from falling apart or becoming boring, with a boat load of dialogue choices. In this game, those 5 options are what those choices consist of, nothing more than just repeating "accept quest" 4 times over. Also the dialogue itself will not display anymore what you are exactly going to say, so even THEN the choices will probably not reflect what you are intending to say. It's like someone didn't proofread anything or check what the hell those branches entail.\n\nEnough about the dialogue choices and story, the game mechanics themselves: are they good? For the most part yes, shooting is the best aspect of this Fallout game. Gone is the need or usefulness of a crutch for aiming and shooting like V.A.T.S. and in comes the smoothness of shooting like a first person shooter. You are able to still use V.A.T.S but if anything it just feels like it is needed maybe more for a console player who is incapable of shooting.\n\nThe perk system is absolute wank, no lie there. In order to access the later perks, you must invest points in perks which WILL NOT BE USEFUL. Wasting of these points from levels is awful design choice, and there was absolutely nothing wrong with the previous Fallout game's use of perks. Why change something like that? If it isn't broken, why change it? It makes the game feel like a grind to get the levels of killing things or lockpicking endlessly to get the perk that you really want, WHICH YOU WILL NEED TO LEVEL UP MORE BECAUSE IT GOES UP IN LEVELS TOO. the perk system is a huge letdown for me personally, I am sure some people will agree too with this design choice.\n\nI could ramble endlessly about how unnecessary some of the things they added in are, like the building sims (which could easily be done in previous games with a modding community) and other taccy or gimmicky ideas, like making LEGENDARY ENEMIES appear (very borderlands-like) that drop weapons with weird stat effects. If anything, the game required more focus on a good script, excellent dialogue and choices,  Also, the hour count on this game for the majority of players will be significantly less than you might imagine, the majority of people will beat it in about 40 hours overall, with not much to explore. The wasteland in Boston is denser, but that means getting to places to find interesting stuff is incredibly easy and makes the game just feel like one big overpopulated town, with nothing else otherwise(there needed to be WAY more wasteland radiation zones like where a bomb site was, easily the highlight of the game for doing something different).\n\nOverall, the game is something that appeals to people who want simplification, and less time taken to get into a game, and once you get into Fallout 4 it will grab you then release you within a second. Nothing will make you come back to this game, No good dialogue, no good branching choices of paths (trust me, I did them all in desperation) and virtually NO GOOD REPLAYABILITY. yes you can play the game again, but when you have done it once, you have done it enough. The DLC that has been coming out looks incredibly boring, Point lookout is literally something you can get for cheaper with an older Fallout game. Just stick with Fallout New Vegas unless you want to play something that is heavily modded and looks a bit prettier than that game, otherwise there is that small remainder of appeal left, which is not worth 50 bucks.","May 19","false","261.7"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","19","26","0","2"

Bethesda sold their soul to Mister Burke\n\nTo further expand my disappointment for Fallout4:\nI started playing RPG's with Bethesda's Elder Scrolls: Oblivion after it had already been released for 3 years.\n\nI deeply fell in love with RPG's, I started playing Gothic, The Witcher, KOTOR, Dragon Age, Fable, Demon Souls... you name it.. I played it. Elder Scrolls: Morrowind was one of the most amazing games I ever experienced due to the role-playing aspects, the atmosphere of being in the world, the challenge, and most importantly the character-building. After playing Fallout 3 which I found to be a good sci-fi apocalyptic variant of Oblivion, it was nice because it just reminded me of Oblivion.. nothing more. Fallout New Vegas, however, blew my mind! I was hooked, and it was the very first game from Bethesda Softworks where I actually dug out every dungeon on the map. I was hooked and fell in love with Fallout. (Noting that it was made by Obsidian, not Bethesda who did Fallout3)\n\nI am so sorry to say it, but Bethesda fails at creating a good Fallout game. I bought Fallout 4 with all the hype and anticipation. Only to discover that they abandoned what made Fallout a franchise: Character-building and damn hard choices to make.\n\nI am currently replaying Oblivion for the fourth time to examine what I am missing in Fallout 4. And another thing I don't have in this game is the feeling of BEING there, the feeling of BELONGING there. My actions do not affect the world. I don't have much actions to begin with because this game feels like an FPS or a brainsucking Sandbox, NOT a RPG.\n\nI will never hold any nostalgia towards my Fallout 4-experience in the future, I don't even plan on beating this game.","May 19","false","52.5"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","19","26","2","2"

Yes you can use a mouse in pipboy but It is even slower and very painfull clickfest.\n\nNew feature - building your own settelements is good and refreshing idea, BUT you doing so in first person view which is the worst possible way how to do it, when you want to build a wall at the other side of the house you need to gou around nearly to a spot where you want you wall to be...and I dont even mention buiding roofs when standing on ground level - NIGHTMARE...\n\nA dog, best friend to the man...not in F4. Dog looks OK and his functions can be very useful, but when you want to give a command to him you need to go to him and "talk" to him (sometimes you need to find him fisrt)...You cant just shout on a dog like in real life...Again, if you played MG5:PP you know that the buddy command system can be done much better...\n\nI cant recomend F4.

Did they just really inverted the positions of the main character?\n\nNow the story - I'll be honest. It's pretty ♥♥♥♥ compared to the previous series, but that kinda is arguable for all the fallout games. However!  Its not the game's story that you are interested in - its the story you develop for yourself of which WHAT MATTERS THE MOST!\n\nNow granted - the whole VOICE PROTAGONIST and OOOH NAMES! Sure pretty cool stuff, but I knew that it will suck ♥♥♥ sooner or later of which I was right. It sucked major mutant ♥♥♥.

As a hardcore Fallout 1 and 2 fan, and a person, that played Bethesda games from Arena to Morrowind,  and end up in F3 and F:NV, this was a huge disappointment.\nWonderful graphics, huge world, great AI and a load of weapons. So why the disappointment? Because this is no more a Fallout game. It lacks the atmosphere, it is too colorful and the dialogues are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The revolution in the RPG system did not happened and the settlement building...well, I am not much of a Sims fan. And the "radiant" quests, randomly generated quests to repeat without any reason or point, not worth it.\nSo, if I have to rate this game as a Fallout serie game, I do not recommend it. It is boring, and has no point. If I have to rate this game as a standalone game, then yes, it is an above average game and you should try it once it gets cheaper.

The optimization must be so lazy, and so poorly done, for a game with such low-resolution textures, and such simple animation, to be killing my computer like this.\n\nNow, With the new patch that came with the DLC, not only is the framerate still horrible, but now objects and textures simply aren't loading in. I'll walk into a town that has no doors, and where the road hasn't rendered in. I'll go to my settlement, and the workbench hasn't loaded in, so I can't do anything. The textures of clothes don't load in, so everyone is just wearing a brown blob over their chest and legs.\n\nThis whole game is a buggy, ugly mess. I highly reccomend that you don't waste your money on it. I've tried everything I can to fix it, and to make it fun.

Bethesda has long been tied for first as one of my favorite game design companies, and I was incredibly excited for Fallout 4 and preordered as soon as it was available to show my support for a series I love.\n\nBut I cannot love this game. I can’t even like it. My spirit dies a little more with every hour I play.\n\nIt began when I heard about the bugs. Characters equipping clipboards like shields from the Elder Scrolls? I’ll laugh it off. Items glitching out and disappearing from sight? If it’s rare enough, I can ignore it. Little girls becoming giants to climb into power armor, which then promptly disappears and leaves a headless naked lady running off into the distance? All right, that one’s pretty strange. Still, I wanted to give the game a fair shot before judging, so up it went – bringing us to the second point, the graphics.\n\nApparently my ultrawide monitor, along with some others, were not considered during development of this game. The highest resolution I’m allowed to play at in windowed mode still barely takes up half the available space. My native aspect ratio isn’t supported at all, so attempting to play full-screen dumbs the resolution down to 800x600. This, I thought, I could also look past, though it’s a far cry from what I’ve come to expect from a AAA title. I didn’t even mind the low poly count; it just stings to realize that, between the chosen graphics settings and clunky game controls, Bethesda apparently considers PC gamers to be more of a “bonus” than a genuine target audience. (I also felt this way with the release of a few other titles, but Fallout 4 seems to be even more strongly geared toward a “console-first” approach.) Even so, I thought, surely the game itself will make up for it! Graphics and finicky mouse controls are nothing in the face of the amazing open-world, customizable, immersive awesomeness that is a Fallout game, right?!\n\nWrong. Because where previous Bethesda games have managed to craft an amazing experience centered around creating whatever kind of character you want – a character where the player decides not only skill and appearance, but also morality, personality, and (to varying extents) backstory – there is instead linearity and rigidity. As a warning to those who haven’t started the game yet, there are mild spoilers ahead.\n\nI feel it is important to note here that linearity and pre-defined player characters are not inherently bad. In fact, I love games where I can play as someone completely different from myself, who has to work within the confines of an existing world and history. The important difference is, those pre-defined characters exist as they are for reasons inherent and important to the game’s world and story, and the games they feature in aren’t meant to give the illusion of player choice; you know what kind of character you’re signing up for when you buy the game, and don’t enter with the expectation of being able to make any choices about who that character is or what motivates them. The Fallout games have established a precedence of high player choice where the main character’s actions, thoughts, and goals are yours to mold as you see fit, and Fallout 4 simply does not deliver on that premise. Instead, the player is forced into a character whose mold is predefined: heterosexual, married, doting parent with no real option to be “evil” and whose post-apocalyptic life revolves around finding their infant son.\n\nI’m sure many people will click with this type of story. Others will find it annoying as it won’t give the option to create the type of character they wanted to play. However, some people – myself included – will find it outright insulting. “Play as anyone you want to be! And by anyone, we mean a parent. And straight. Make absolutely sure you’re a straight parent because we don’t give you any other choice. Oh, and don’t be mean. Be a good, straight-laced, straight parent, m’kay?” No, not okay, because a game that claims to let you be whoever you want to be shouldn’t outright exclude so many differing life choices. As a woman who doesn’t want children herself, all I could think was – why is it assumed that my character wanted a child, and in the middle of a war at that? Why can’t I be trekking across the Wasteland to save a sibling’s or neighbor’s kid instead? Why can’t homosexual players at least choose the gender of their partner and have an adopted/surrogate baby instead? Bethesda could have easily kept with the same overall story of “save the kidnapped baby” without alienating so many players, but chose not to.\n\nAnd so, my immersion was shattered not ten seconds past character creation. I kept playing anyway, determined that the game would eventually get better, only to be met with cookie-cutter characters and halfhearted dialog wheels. (“Yes, no, or later? Oh, and I guess you can be snarky sometimes, but let’s just take away that karma meter because remember, good straight parents aren’t allowed to be evil.”) I tried ignoring the main story, but am incessantly reminded by almost every character willing to have a conversation that I’m supposed to be looking for my son, and that the only correct choice on the dialog wheel is the one that gets me closer to finding him. Quests so far have been bland and the main character’s voice acting subpar (mostly due to limited and repetitive options along the lines of “I’d love to help! Tell me what to do. Tell me more. Go on. Of course I’ll help. Tell me more. I’ll help!”). With the main story having already lost my attention, it feels more like a chore to feed the cycle of kill monster, obtain item, build settlement when the script surrounding the quests is just as redundant as the quest mechanics themselves. The Perks system has been watered down and powerful items are given at the outset of the game rather than found as you play, but these aren’t necessarily detriments – just different.\n\nI keep trying to make myself play, hoping that if I can find at least one tucked-away Vault with a tidbit of intrigue that the game will have been worth the purchase, but there is just too much disappointment for the game to be fun. As stated in this review, almost everything I find wrong with the game is something I was more than willing to overlook – but combined, it’s too much.\n\nIf you have never played a Fallout game before, have no pre-existing expectations, and aren’t bothered by any of the items I’ve mentioned above… read a few other reviews, the positive ones. See if you’d still like to try it, and if you do, have fun; there’s still plenty about the game mechanics to enjoy. But if you played Fallout 3 or New Vegas and were hoping for more of the same, then take this game with a grain of salt. Personally, I’ll be waiting a while to see if a plethora of mods can make the experience more bearable; but, honestly – who wants to play a “bearable” game?\n","November 14, 2015","false","5.5"," 541 of 981 people (55%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","55","541","981","25","15"

If yes, I insist you read this before purchasing. If not, you may want to read someone else's review.\n\nLike many others I feel that there should be a third option between thumbs up and down. Is it a bad game? No absolutely not. The world is well designed with lots and lots to explore; nearly every building/location has some mini story you can delve into. It does have its charm for, say, the first 25-50 hours of gaming, which to some is more than sufficient. In reality though, within that timespan you can only grasp the surface of everything Fallout 4 offers. Attempting to experience as much of the world as possible will eventually lead to a lot of frustration and boredom. You will start to notice how any choices you make have little to no impact on the world (nothing remotely close to blowing up Megaton in F3), dialogue is very bland with every option practically leading to the same outcome. On top of that, doing too many missions raises your level so high the game becomes obnoxiously simple (Starting from lvl 30 I played on survival, not dying once besides the very rare surprise mini nuke). Finally, I feel there's too little variety in monsters, weapons, environment and quests (95% involving fetch this or kill that). Why do I still recommend it you may ask. Well, there's no denying I still managed to waste 230+hours on this game and enjoy myself from time to time (PS: That is the time it took for me to experience all endings and complete all side-quests). Also, again, it is not a bad game per se.  If Fallout 4 were a burger it would be a royale with cheese. But no matter how tasty the burger may be, eating it every day would get boring fast, just like Fallout 4. All in all, it is too much of the same which limits the enjoyment and unmotivates you to try and complete the game in its entirety.\nRating: 6.5/10\n\nHalwin's 100% Completion RecommendationDifficulty: 1/10\nTime: 75+ Hours (25 extra for DLCs)\nConsidering that all achievements can be earned while playing on the easiest difficulty setting and using console commands (cheats) does not disable them, there is no difficulty what so ever in acquiring any of the achievements in Fallout 4. Most achievements are unlocked by completing the game in three of the four 'different' endings; saving at the right point in the main story will save you a lot of time. The remaining may require certain perks or simply consume a lot of time to complete, but overall it's a straightforward 100%.\n\n-Edit: Updated for DLC-","January 22","true","262.9"," 108 of 189 people (57%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","57","108","189","12","4"

But, once the settlements are established the lack of events do not generate enough long-term motivation to keep up with them.\no Despite a user interface based on a console layout the inventory management is satisfactory.\n\n- Loading times are significantly longer in populated areas and accompanied by irregular framerate drops.\n- Occasional delays in correct depiction of texture resolutions.\n\nCombat & gameplay:\n\n+ The ability to approach a potential combat situation in multiple ways is well balanced in the game.\n+ More than 70 different perks offer a unique character development.\n+ Usage of the Vault-Tec Assisted Targeting System (V.A.T.S.) gives the player a more tactical approach of combat situations.\n+ Impressive customization system allows for extensive weapon and armor modifications.\n+ Each weapon category has a variety of entertaining fatality animations, which are triggered via V.A.T.S. and the action camera.\n+ The fighting in the power armor changes the perception and tactic.\n+ Excellent A.I. behaviour of enemies creates dynamic combat situations. They take cover, throw grenades, start flanking manoeuvres and dodge when charging towards the player.\n+ Good and reliable A.I. behaviour of the companion during combat sections.\n\no Action points regenerate in real time and are also used as an endurance bar during sprints and alternative power attacks.\no Being exposed to radiation damage reduces the maximum health.\n\n- Stealth sections with a follower can be complicated due to suboptimal A.I. routines.\n- Durability for weaponry has been removed with exception of the power armor.\n- Stimpacks heal crippled limbs.\n- Highest level of difficulty, called survival, does not include feelings of hunger or thirst.\n\nCharacters & story:\n\n+ The main storyline is quite interesting with a dramatic touch to it.\n+ Charismatic companions offer a fair amount of witty comments.\n+ The behaviour of the player influences the companions, each of them has its own likes and dislikes.\n+ Very good voice acting of all characters.\n\no The different factions add a certain amount of replayability to the game, but they have little impact on the behaviour or decision making of the player.\no Only one companion can be recruited at the same time.\n\n- Despite several dialogue options during conversations, the responses of the protagonist do not always reflect the intentions of the player.\n- General mimic of characters is too static and sometimes out of proportions.\n\nSummary:\n\nFallout 4 represents yet another milestone in Bethesda’s interpretation of the Fallout universe. The urge to explore every location on your map, spending points on the elaborate skill tree or crafting and modifying your weaponry will keep you up late into the night.\n\nYet, the streamlining of the game for both consoles and PCs has led to a loss of quality for the PC players. Next to graphical and performance related shortcomings, there are a couple of questionable decisions why certain gameplay mechanics, like the maintenance of components which was introduced in Fallout 3, have been removed from the game.\n\nIn addition, it remains to be seen if Bethesda will open the game to the modding community as they have done it with Skyrim.

Nice to have your own settlement and build further improvements, like interior decoration, managing food and water supply, turrets and traps for defense\nor even construct your own shacks...out of the few parts that are present.\nYour settlement can also be attacked by raiders, super mutants and so on...tho in my 70~ hours of gametime I only got attacked once while working on my settlement,\nI couldn't even look so fast who attacked as the assailants were steamrolled from settlers and defenses.\nAlso the bulding controls are quite the challenge.\n\n- graphics are fine, like they were in Fallout 3, NV....with some more fancy lighting.\n\n- performance is solid for the most parts of the game, tho there are places were your framerate will drop significant.\n\n- I haven't crashed once in my playtime, bugs I can't tell either, which doesn't mean there aren't any or I took them for a feature.~\n\n\nCon's:\n\n- dumbed down S.P.E.C.I.A.L. system, no more skills and skillchecks,\nplenty of perks which now have several levels you can choose depending on how high the corresponding special attribute and your character level is.\nWhich translates to every level you gain a perk point, you can also put that point to increase a spcial attribute, that's it.\nThere is no max level for a reason now it seems, that said without you could screw your build from the very beginning, quite easily.\nWhich leads to...\n\n- bad dialogues, even worse as it was in Fallout 3, happy save scamming as you try to see through copypasta choices you get.\n\n- Storyline/Mainquests. As I don't want to spoil here I can only say that choices and outcomings leave much to be desired for.\n\n- Beginning/Vault 111/Tutorial: Way too short, feels unfinished, rushed. Also speaking of tutorial, don't expect one for settlement building.\n\n- Companions. There are plenty but to be honest, besides ♥♥♥♥♥♥ AI that sometimes may even lead to your death, those aren't very special to remember...\nI usually had my Dogmeat around me 80% of my playtime.\n\n- voice acting. There's the writing and the voice itself, both are lacking imho, especially the protagonists voice is shallow and feels unfamiliar,\nalso might be part of the reason dialogue options are that shallow aswell. Too much voice acting altogether.\n\n- RNG loot is through the roof, you're not going to far or dangerous places to receive a bad ♥♥♥ gun or something like that, loot isn't hand placed at all as far as I can tell. (excluding companion guns)\n\n- Replay value. I tried a second walkthrough with a different character build but due to reasons above I couldn't even make myself touch the mainquest or settlement again, just ran around killing things and then died of boredom.\n\n- personal gripe. "War, war never changes." ..No ♥♥♥♥ I got it the first few times, it's the thing you always get in the ending to make you shiver and think about it but here it's like..oh coo' I can say that too! It's loosing it's meaning, really childish.\n\n- Bethesda. I'm actually asking this to myself...Don't people have any sort of integrity anymore?\n\n- oh yea...UI sucks...again.\n\n\nThanks for reading, might have missed stuff but I'm out of fuel.","November 21, 2015","false","116.7"," 749 of 1,362 people (55%) found this review helpful 42 people found this review funny","55","749","1","42","34"

The game is filled to the brim with adventure as you explore it’s dark and mysterious world. You seek out settlements and locations on your map as you go around demolishing anything that stands in the way of the goals you want to achieve and the marks you want to leave on the Commonwealth and it’s people.\n\nThe game starts off with you, your spouse and your infant living in a futuristic house inside of Boston with a robot butler. This is where you can build your face for your character and their spouse if you choose to do so. Life seems perfect before a television broadcast alerts of nuclear bombs hitting America destroying everything. You sprint off to the vault getting one last look at the outside world before you and your family get locked in the vault frozen for 200 years where you wake up in the year 2277.\n\nAfter waking up, you find your son has gone missing and so you are off to escape the vault as the “Lone Survivor” of Vault 111. What you find is that even after 200 years of being frozen the world is still a nuclear wasteland with people fighting over things like food weapons and other gear. Alongside that there are also mutated creatures such as 2 headed deers and giant scorpions roaming the apocalyptic wasteland.\n\nYour adventure in the wasteland builds on how you want to play the game. You can run around not really following the quests and instead build yourself a huge fort made out of the materials you find from scavenging houses, mines, bunkers and other places. You can be the Commonwealth’s generic hero by helping out small settlements being attacked by raiders and monsters or you can be the big tough guy who takes everything for himself.\n\nAs far as wasteland creatures go, there is a wide variety of them to find from ghouls to super mutants to gigantic crabs the wasteland has it all including legendary enemies which drop rare loot with special attributes. Whether you choose to fight these creatures head on with your shiny power armour or sneak around each with their own strategic benefits is entirely up to you.\n\nThe main storyline of the game is rather short, if you rush through it, it will take you around 15-20 hours. There are however a lot of side quest lines which can be very long and also rewarding if you go through them. In the story there are factions of people which can be joined by the protagonist and build up their trust and respect for you by doing their quests and generally helping out with miscellaneous tasks.\n\nI did rather enjoy the main story of the game as well as most of sidequests which some people found repetitive. The real serious problem I have with this game is that it’s lacking that it’s lacking that  exquisite depth  that I felt other RPGs offer. The characters in the game were very bland, no one seemed to have much of a personality and were just there like robot. The limited amount of dialogue options in the game don’t help with this as you can make a joke every once in awhile but mostly it is just  falls so flat.\n\nDespite that, the gameplay is extremely superb. The gunplay feels fun and responsive compared to a lot of first person shooters I’ve played. The enemies feel satisfying to kill using or not using VATS, the automated agility point based targeting system which is in a few other Fallout games. Adding things like advanced crafting made playing the game almost like a survival first person shooter with RPG elements more than just a plain RPG.\n\nGraphics wise the game doesn’t look as great as some other AAA games coming out in 2015. It doesn’t look awful but it looks  dated.  Which is one of the big things I have to talk about; The game’s engine. The engine for this game is  ancient  at this point. It feels like it also. So many things could’ve been improved if Bethesda pushed it a bit further and brought in a brand new engine for Fallout 4. They didn’t do so and that’s honestly just feels like laziness. A lot of things felt like they were dealt with using laziness in the game. The building is alright but it honestly feels like something that was crammed into the game to add extra content and is quite glitchy. If they would’ve used a new engine for the game, I’m almost certain that it would’ve earned a lot more respect and been considered revolutionary like Skyrim was, but it just isn’t.\n\nWhy most of this dosen’t really bother me is because this is that there are already mods that fix most of my problems and that add more content for the game. As always places like Nexus provide a large amount of mods for the game to improve it to the player’s liking.\n\nTL;DR\n\nFallout 4 is a  FPS with RPG elements and not an insignificant amount of problems. There are a lot of things broken with it but the amazing gameplay, adventuring and exploring makes it worth your time and very much worth it on sale.\n\n8.8/10.\n\nFor more reviews like this, check out my curator page  here!\n","February 10","true","105.9"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","21","30","0","4"

FO4 has just one big issue: it is commercial. It completely cuts the feeling of the entire saga. 60€ for this game is too much. I bought it for 35 and I still don't think it was a nice deal. The settlement crafting could have been like Skyrim's Heartfire, not this horror. The new skill system is too much simple, it feels like I'm playing Pokèmon and not FO. The plot is nice, but all the humor and sarcasm of the saga are completely deleted.

Just to play the game had to tinker with settings or it wouldn't start and my specs smash the required ones. The intro story is boring but once out of the vault gets better. The interface is cumbersome and sluggish (no problem with frame rates for the game just the interface). You need only look at the hundreds of other reviews talking about the mouse interaction problems.\n\nI would say to anyone sitting on the fence about purchasing to hold off for a bit until they release a few patches. Being a fan of the series I will play on and hopefully comeback to change my review to a positive one\n\nSo after putting a bit more time into the game do I want to change my review to a positive one ? NO\n\nPlaying this game I keep thinking of a line from a Divinyls song "there's a fine line between pleasure and pain"\n\nTo give you an idea I will use the dog as an example. In fights he charges in keeps the enemy busy and I can pick them of with little risk GOOD.....I turn a corner to find a boss monster my health is low so time to make a quick retreat but dog doesn't attack the monster he blocks the doorway so I can't get out bang dead BAD......Found a legandary monster way to tough for a straight fight so time to lay some mines and even things up. Spent 10 minutes setting trap just laying last mine outside a door (before I lure him out)  dog opens the door and legandary monster one shot kills me......Bad but also funny\n\nAlso picked up a bug around the 20 hour mark that if I save a game can no longer access pipboy display have to exit game and reload to continue.\n\nThen there is VATS my sniper rifle has 98% chance to hit. Find an enemy VATS tells me body shot is 90% chance to hit, head is less than 20% so I try for the body twice for 2 misses no AP left so I aim by myself at the targets head and one shot dead target ......after this happened few times I just gave up on vats ..BAD\n\nClear a house of super mutants loot the entire house including both sides of a locked door then pick the lock for xp and 4 supermutants transport in killing me .........Fine this time when I clear the house I leave mines where they teleport in then pick the lock and boom boom boom add a couple headshots to finish them off and I think that is dumbass lazy programing ......BAD\n\nThe crafting is really cool but as with everything else it has its bugs like one of the corner wall pieces will not let you put any type of roof on it (the roof tries to default attach to the outside) so I have a workshed with 4 very leaky corners lol.\n\nAll in all there is a good game ready to emerge when a little bit more patching and modding happens so wait a bit and you will probably end up with a really enjoyable game","November 9, 2015","false","60.5"," 251 of 452 people (56%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","56","251","452","17","4"

As sequels are made to videos games, we are expect them to expand greatly on their predecessors. Although Fallout, for it's size, is a completed game with some annoyoing bugs, it really lacks a lot of the characteristcs and diversity in choices and factions. The story itself (No spoilers) is just very linear. Every dialoge option you have gives you 4 almost identical choices to the last and no matter what you choose, unless it's a just a simple yes or no option, you will always get the same outcome in whatever quest (main or side.) The only REAL option I felt that I've had is in choosing my ending with the faction I've chosen. When it comes to the many factions of the wasteland, the ones you can actually interact with are minimal. Most I feel are only there for their nostalgic factor. Ex. The Followers of Atom just attack you on sight without any real explanation and (SPOILER) their camp in the crator seems very meaningless as far as I've encountered.\n\nAs someone who really enjoys games for their storys, I was really let down with the minimal, low quality story and content (I could rant about the settlement creation for days) and for those reason along with the fact that it seems to have undershot it's predessecors and other Bethesda games that use the same engine (looking at you Skyrim) I can't recommend this as a quailty game.\n\nBUT THIS IS MY OWN OPINION. If you are enjoying the game then, please, keep playing. As for me, this game just didn't meet the standards of a Fallout game I, and many others, were hoping for. Hopefully the next Elder Scrolls game doesn't make the same mistakes and fall short of Skyrim.","December 17, 2015","false","101.1"," 23 of 34 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","23","34","0","0"

I played vanilla for a few hours before jumping into the mods that were offered so I'd have a better experience, but still: Fallout 4 is a bit of a disappointment to me.\n\nIf you're familiar and enjoyed the previous Fallout games, I wouldn't recommend it to you. A lot of beloved core features have been stripped and/or simply gone. Returning theme of looking for someone that you'll never care about, main story is always a bust. But, where it really lacks (for me), is exploration. It just seems smaller than previous Fallout and Elder Scroll games, or should I say lacks content and stories?\n\nIf you're new to Bethesda games, such as Fallout, then I'd say give it a try. You may enjoy it. It's somewhat of a decent shooter, but the rpg elements are lackluster and extremely basic. Some stories and characters shine, while some just fall flat and cliche.\n\nThough, the addition of settlements (if you get the mod to eliminate or increase the limit of what you can build) is really fun for a few hours. But, even after building up your settlements, you won't do much else with them. Occassional "raids" which are pretty much dealt with by the time you fast travel to it.\n\nI had fun with it, got my money's worth, but still disappointed. I'd say get it if you really want to, but if you're on the fence, definitely wait until a sale and try out the previous Fallout games if you haven't already.","May 30","false","93.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

Nothing in the game seems to have a broader connection to anything else in the game. In F:NV and to a lesser extent Fallout 3, it was a lot clearer why the different factions were in the area, and what they wanted to achieve and what their relation was to the other factions and settlements, but here that connection is barely there.\n\nThe raiders in power armour should be really scary to the people living in the wasteland but they don't seem to care, besides the occasional randomly generated quest. The arrival of the BoS should be huge news and if the Institute is truly so villified, people would rally behind the BoS, but nope. No reaction.\n\nThe dialogues were mostly just 3 ways of saying the same thing, with no other consequence to any of them.\n\nAnd I might be in the minority here, but I absolutely hated the basebuilding thing, and it didn't help that it was forced into the story and that every companion keeps complaining when you pick up junk. I don't want to pick it up either but can't finish the game if I don't collect more of these coffee cups. If I wanted to do basebuilding, I would have downloaded a mod for it.

This game doesn't do well as a First Person Shooter, due to unrealistic combat movements (strafing back and forth as if it was Unreal Tournament without losing aim) and poor AI, and it's a worse RPG that it's predecessors with only 4 choices that in the end railroads you along one story path. And that story path is not that interesting.\n\nEven the new settlement building system feels clunky and pointless. There's no good tutorial of how to expand your settlement, I had to find that out via googling, and I have pretty much nothing to gain.\n\nAs far as settlement building goes, I'd rather play the Sims or Minecraft, and as far as First Person Shooters go I'd rather play one of those military shooter games (CoD etc), which is fine, because those areas are not the forte of Fallout. However, what is supposed to be the strong point of this game, RPG, has been watered down to try to appease console CoD fans and Minecraft kids with the other features of the game, and thus Fallout 4 ends up being mediocre at everything it does.\n\n*SPOILERS*\n\nThe beginning is anti-climactic when you start off in a really interesting location, pre-war Boston, and can't even exit your house before the mayhem starts. There is no chance to devoloping emotional attachment to the pre-war world, the community you live in or even your family before you're railroaded into the vault. Then, in the vault your spouse is killed and you baby taken while you can do precisely nothing. No role playing, just a bad plot thrust at you after 10 minutes. Then, when you finally encounter the killer and kidnapper, they behave all calm and dignified and you respond pretty much the same way. Again, no role playing. Yeah, you can cuss at them but that's about it. Oh, yeah, and you mutually agree like mature adults to fight to the death.

The game limits your decision making and forces you to take on the role of a "good guy". The FPS aspets are well done don't get me wrong, who doesn't love watching raiders heads explode but it lacks a lot in an RPG element. Dialogue is limited and in most cases your choices are. Yes, no, (Sarcastic) and more information unlike previous games when the character takes on a role of his/her own based on how people were treated and how you may help or harm them. It feels as if bethesda spent more time on Preston Garvey and his settlements rather than adding more of a Wasteland atmosphere. With over 200 hours of my life spent on this game I only wish I could have them back. It was a waste of my money and time, the game is not at it's best and It's easy to see what their main focuses were. As I end this I'd like to say I'm a huge fan and have played every Fallout from 1 - 4 I just don't think this game is anything like Fallout and I hope that Bethesda can change that in the future, maybe in 2077 we'll have a Fallout of our own who knows...","May 26","false","213.5"," 24 of 36 people (67%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","67","24","36","4","2"

Do you want a good Fallout game?  Because this isn't it.  This is some other game where you shoot everything and sometimes there's RPG stuff to do.  I realized I needed to change it when I came to the conclusion I just don't care about anything in the game that happened and have no interest in spending more time in that bland, bland wasteland.  Maybe mods and DLC will add what this game is missing, but right now, I can't recommend this game.  Bethesda needs to let someone else take the reigns because they can't write an interesting world, story, character to save their lives.\n\n\nPros:\n\n- The world is a huge step up from FO3 and New Vegas\n- Graphics are a nice step up from Skyrim or previous Fallouts\n- Shooting mechanics are noticeably improved\n- *Some* good companions, Nick and Piper were pretty good!\n- Weapon crafting adds a nice dimension\n- Will scratch that exploration and combat itch nicely\n- *Some* interesting side story/questlines, vault 114 was actually kinda neat and had some of that good ol' dark FO1/2 humor!\n- Building settlements is a great idea!\n\nCons:\n\n- Overall, the writing isn't good, especially with the main storyline.  The primary event that is supposed to spur you along in the main story was incredibly underwhelming.  I couldn't care less about the motivation they tried to give me because they invested, literally, less than 5 minutes in set up.\n- *Still* a distinct lack in the dark, weird, satirical humor that was all over FO1 and 2\n- The choices you make through out the game feel like they have almost zero impact, you can side with a faction and that's about it.  What you do while supporting a given faction really doesn't matter at all.\n- Very, VERY easy to break quest lines.  I did things in an order Bethesda didn't forsee and I completely destroyed my first play through, NPCs reacted to things I never did, acted like I did side quests I never even got.  Major NPC: "I can't believe you banished Dave to the wasteland!!!"  Me: "Who the ♥♥♥♥ is Dave?"\n- Building Settlements feels half implemented.  The building is twitchy and feels like the overpoch mod in DayZ, which, is not a flattering thing for a AAA game.\n- Skills are gone, so no more leveling up big guns, or sneak, or barter.  It's all based on perks and SPECIAL stats, I think they streamlined something that didn't need to be.\n- Only way to resolve conflict is to kill everything.  Well 99% of the time guns blazing is the only option, this is very, very lame.  First play through, 10 int, 10 cha, no way to put those to use to find alternate solutions to problems.\n- Game takes place 200 years after the great war, no one has built anything new (besides ramshackle huts).  Humanity has frozen in place, this seems wierd, jarring and a complete lack of imagination, or maybe just lazy world building.  The ONLY human advancement in this game comes from The Brotherhood and another faction that existed prior to the war and has been in hiding the whole time.  What the hell has the world been up to for *200* years!?\n- Most side quests are super bland, "Go here, Kill a Bunch of crap"\n- I'm the General of the Minutemen, why the hell am I running around and holding every random settlers hand when a raider looks at them funny?  Why can't I order my minutemen to deal with it?\n- There is no character development for ANY character, at all\n- Karma system is gone.\n- No real repurcussions for being a bad guy, can't kill kids (I use this as an example of that weird FO1/2 do ANYTHING you want mentality that Bethesda is petrified of), can't kill vendors and take their stock, can't kill many "main" NPCs.  For example, I *hated* a leader of one of the factions, blowing his head off did ♥♥♥♥ all, he just stood back up and tried to kill me.  I then killed every single member of that faction in their main base, and it had NO impact on the world!  I literally killed *dozens* of people and it didn't matter!  I hate, HATE this.\n\nThings that personally drive me nuts that some people might not care about:\n\n- I hate the props you get when building settlements, for example when you build a new wall in your town it looks like its about to fall apart and is pieced together with chicken wire.  I hate this.  Why the hell would you build a home from scratch just to make it look like garbage?  There're holes in the walls you build big enough for a bloatfly to cruise through!  WHY!?!\n- Weapon and Armor model/texture designs often look like butt (imo).  For example, you find the best power armor in the game, you invest tons and tons of skills and resources to upgrade it, it's still rusty and chipped.\n- No slide show at the end.  The great voice over slide show deal they've done in past Fallouts is missing.  I really liked that!  I can see how other people wouldn't care that it's gone though.\n\n\nOverall:\n\nIt's a good game!  It's a very fun game!  It's a lot better than FO3 and New Vegas(mechanically, FO4 writing is several steps down)!  BUT!  It's not a good Fallout game.  If you're like me and started with FO1 and then FO2, the writing, characters and player choice just don't compare.  If you just want a shooty game where you explore stuff and have a bit of light RPG stuff to do, then this game is right up your alley.  If you want a Fallout game, go install 1 or 2 or even New Vegas, because you aren't going to get what you want from this.","December 7, 2015","false","71.0"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","18","25","0","0"

I really, really don't know.\n\nLet's 'try' to do this from the start.\nYou play a guy with military training who goes into cryo, or a women with household chores training (completely ignoring the complete survival chance disparity in the husband/wife). You then have to go look for your infant son. You, like a complete idiot, still think your son is a newborn despite the fact that you quite obviously exit cyro-stasis at very different times.\n\nYou then are then ham-fisted a dog from the get go (like, hey guys, dogs are cool right?) as well as having a bunch of other immortal god companions who spend the entire fight on their ♥♥♥. You can only play one character - concerned daddy. I mean, concerned daddy can either be chill about finding his son and be polite, or be slightly abrupt and annoyed about finding his son. But at the end of the day, you're not choosing who you want to be; the game has already done that for you. You're roleplaying exactly what Bethesda wants.\n\nFort building is a joke. The NPC's will literally steal your power armour and make it impossible for you to recover (exo-suits can't be taken off corpses, just the armour) straight from your fort. That's right, settlers know how to use power armour. Guess training ain't needed, huh? Placement is regularly buggy and fussy, and whilst you can scrap all sorts of **** and that's cool and all, you can't level out the ground you're building on which just leads to the realistic 'build space' being where the game sodding well lets you. 3-4 slots in the first one and a couple in one or two others. Oh, and the house you build for yourself? Gonna get invaded by settlers.\n\nYou're once again ham-fisted the role of brotherhood knight, oh, and you're also the general of the minutemen! After about 3 minutes outta the vault.\n\nSidequests are literally MMO tier - go here, kill raiders, come back, get reward.\n\nOptimisation is 'eh' at best, and your FPS will get annihilated in the city.\n\nDifficulty seems to vary to ridiculous degrees with some areas seemingly levelling with you and others being preset.\n\nThe weapon customisation is cool, but the quantity of skills and components required just for say.. a shotgun stock is ridiculous and will take a huge amount of levels.\n\nThe looting gets ridiculous too when you see names like "Tactical compensated heavy stocked automatic suppressed bayoneted laser rifle" and after a while, all these mods mean nothing, it just turns into another slog fest of putting round after round into some up-levelled raider's skull, desperately hoping the fight will end.\n\nRadiation actually matters now which is nice. But no radiation sickness. (wat)\n\nPower armour is a cool rethink. Shame it completely ****s all over the lore.\n\nRomance companions? What like say "I thunk we should be more than fronds" "oki, we are lol"\n\nJust generally being ham-fisted with companions. Stop it, stop.\n\nSeriously, am I not allowed my own house? I know I've said it, but when I build my own house I don't want it invaded by a brahmin caravan that blocks the doorway.\n\nNo more skills, just a ****ty rethink of the perk system simply leads to a game where you don't get a stronger character, the game just keeps asking you to play it FPS style and occasionally pick up a new weapon.\n\nHonestly the most disappointing starting vault ever.\n10 people in cryo and some staff that died after a year. Absolutely tiny too.\n\nSimply put, this isn't an rpg anymore. This is like if they stole Mass Effect's dialogue wheel, made a huge mess out of it, and removed any last semblance of an RPG.\n\nWell, back to Fallout 1-3 + Vegas, guess that's where the franchise ended.","January 31","false","273.7"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","18","25","0","1"

That's great and all, but it doesn't make up for the lack of RPG elements. There aren't any skills and it results in the once-interesting perk system to be extremely watered down. Not to mention the fact that you can just get every single perk in the game, completely void of builds and replayability. Any choices you make hold very little impact and the lack of a Karma system means there aren't any repercussions for your actions. The dumb dialogue system that's borrowed from Bioware and Telltale with few choices and vague descriptions only makes the whole role-playing thing even worse. Combined with a multitude of uninteresting MMO-tier quests and a mind-numbingly boring and poorly constructed story, Fallout 4 makes for a bad RPG and bad Fallout title.","December 16, 2015","false","261.3"," 80 of 139 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","80","139","4","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/proloto/recommended/377160/","proloto","proloto","http://steamcommunity.com/id/proloto/","21 products in account","Many negative reviews here dropped the game very quickly.  I was more patient.  I've been averaging about 12 hours of play per day since release - more than every negative reviewer I've seen.  I have completed the main quest line (only 2% of steam users have done so as of this post).  I have 50% of the achievements.  So I feel qualified to give a review having experienced a large portion of the game.\n\nSpoiler Free PortionMaybe a lot of my impression stems from the fact that the game is simply too easy.  I started on Normal to get my feet wet, and moved to the hardest after a few hours once I learned the main game mechanics.  Here are a few things that I just found, well... stupid:\n\nSettlements:  This is a big one.  I had a settlement that I used for only one purpose: purified water (read below).  Other than that, I simply let every single one of my settlements die.  They served no game play purpose, but the game makes them seem ever so important.  They are not.  And heads up, unless you spend a substantial amount of time on them and waste perks into Leadership 2 (like I did), they will never be as useful as simply going to Diamond City to stock up.  Talk about a useless mechanic (except for purified waters - read below).\n\nRadiation: You think this is going to be a major part of the game?  You have a whole meter just to measure it.  It's part of your life gauge.  You find tons of drugs to cure/prevent it.  There's entire quests revolving around radiation.  So naturally I was scared of it... in the beginning.  But after about 10 hours I realized that it's totally utterly pointless.  I got a doctor to cure my radiation twice in 80+ hours.  I used approximately 4 radaways, 2 of which were almost surely a keyboard mistake since the stim pack shortcut (e) is too close to the radaway shortcut (r).  I ended the game with like 200 unused radaways.  I had a hazmat suit that prevented an arbitary amount of radiation that I never had to wear.  I encountered one enemy radiation weapon, which didn't do any damage at all because I was in a good suit of Power Armor by that point.  What a disappointment: they could've made this damage type actually viable, but instead it just tricked me into thinking it was an important mechanic.\n\nV.A.N.S.:  An attempt to give this game a turn-based element, this game mechanic is again TOTALLY pointless.  After some testing in the beginning of the game, I quickly found out that 99% of the time it's better to just pretend this game is a true first person shooter and forget about this functionality.  V.A.N.S. is usually less accurate than what you can do with your mouse (assuming you're O.K. at first person shooters - I'm not, which is saying a lot).  It for some reason does less damage.  You can only get in a few shots before you have to revert to point and click anyway.  Yet there's all of these perks and abilities that are associated with V.A.N.S. - why?  I just completely stopped using it after the first few hours, tried it again for a little after 20 hours just to make sure, and then quickly reverted.  I get that you can make it more accurate with perks and make it do crits and it can help situationally in melee battles, but honestly it's so bulky and slow to use it just becomes annoying when you know you can do more dps in human-time by just carefully aiming at the enemies' heads and clicking a few times.\n\nFood:  OK, small spoiler here.  I accidentally found out that if you have excess water at your settlement, the remainder will become purified waters that you can take with you.  I made a settlement with like 10 people, and 50 excess water.  Every time I returned I had a supply of as much purified water as I could handle.  Once I realized that, I only carried around tons of purified water (and stim packs, of course, since they don't weight anything).  I set purified waters to the #1 hotkey, and just spammed it when I was in trouble during a battle.  Having an infinite supply of healing potions that I could spam on demand made every action I take seem unimportant.\n\nPower Armor:  I avoided using power armor during most of my run because I SUSPECTED that it would be game breaking.  I was both right and wrong.  The game was already so incredibly easy (even on the hardest difficulty) that it honestly only made a perceptible difference during one particularly, uh, enemy-fire-intensive quest.  It did increase my carrying weight, so I continued to use it for that purpose only.  Again, a useless game mechanic that gets a lot of lime light.  Just skip the power armor so you don't have to worry about fusion core management.\n\nDrugs:  Jets and Stimpacks - that's all you need.  Forget about all of the other options - enough said.\nSpoiler-ish Portions\nPistol Choices:  My mid-game centered completely around one item: Kellog's Pistol.  It does way more damage than anything else you can get at that point in the game.  Only problem is, I wasn't able to find additional ammo for it until I turned, like, level 14?  If you do the main quests, you will get this item.  Once I got this, I just poured all bottlecaps and other things that were not Kellog's Pistol-related into Kellog's Pistol ammunition.  I kept looking for better guns, but everything I could find or create (I had top gun-nut and science perks) was still worse than this gun that you get from a main-line quest at like level 8.  Only until I was around level 35 did I find a gun that had more dps than Kellog's Pistol.  So between levels 14 and 35 I spent a great deal of wasted time keeping a look out for a better option that simply never showed up.  That's most of the game using one weapon that I didn't even need to upgrade/modify!  I'm sure somebody could point me to what I could've done differently, but I'll remind you that the game was already too easy.  In hindsight I didn't need a better gun, the Kellog's Pistol was simply available too early, rendering all other weapons pointless for me.\n\nCompanions: I'm told that you can get into relationships and get perks and whatnot from doing things that a companion likes.  Make X6-88 happy - get +30 plasma resistance!  Who cares - I encountered one legendary brotherhood of steel enemy that had a plasma weapon.  Other than I only saw them at vendors for more bottlecaps than I've ever owned.  Also, why go through all the trouble for another companion?  The biggest asset a companion offers is that you can give him junk to carry when you're full.  For that purpose, I simply started using the very first companion you have access to: dogmeat.  He carries things just as well as the next chump, but doesn't get upset when you steal from people or lie.  Also, he tackles people so you can get head shots easier (see, who needs V.A.N.S.?)\n\nSide quests:  No side quest in this game is engaging.  There is the main quest line which is O.K.  I've been hesitant to compare this to other games, since I want to focus entirely on FO4's own merits, but let's be honest - this game is Skyrim with less people and different skins.  In Skyrim you have Winterhold College's quest line, The Thieve's Guild, The Assassin's Guild, Dawngaurd, etc... (I know some of them are DLC, whatever).  In FO4, there is only the main quest line.  Everything else on the side is basically a one-and-done type of mission with no reward.  I simply stopped doing them after I realized that a 100 bottlecap reward and more radaways for 30 minutes of my time was not worthwhile.\nI'm at the character limit, but I could go on.  They could've made these above elements more interesting or important, but instead they just confused me into thinking there was more depth in this game than there truly was.\n\nTLDR; get the Kellog's Pistol, drink purified water, and ignore everything that doesn't get you to completing the main quest - nothing else is worth your time.","November 17, 2015","false","83.2"," 74 of 128 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","74","128","3","1"

It's just soooo underwhelming and disappointing compared to its predecessors and other games of its time like Witcher 3 or MGS5. I don't mean to sound like I'm complaining about the graphics, but when you have such low rez or low detail, there simply shouldn't be any loading doors and they should not take as long as they do. Many would say it's because there is so much to do, but in truth there isn't. I struggled to find fun quests to do and most of my game time was just miscellaneous quests pushing me to level up. When compared to Fallout 3 or Skyrim, there was absolutly nothing to do but misc. quests which seemed forced most of the time. Witcher 3 has much better detail and graphics, the maps are very much larger, there are more quests, and there are hundreds of NPC's and no loading doors and few bugs. The followers were a nice touch, but their stories and behavior seemed cliche for Bethesda and I only liked about half of the cast and neglected the rest. Many of the factions simply weren't interesting and I couldn't appeal to them in really any way resulting in me going with the same faction. The loot system was a bit wonky because by the time you got comfortable with an item or weapon you found something better and never really seemed fixed on one thing (some people like that). Building wasn't great because they barely explained it and was just annoying sometimes, especially with gates and fences. Occasionally you would be low on a resource in a town but you would have to play detective for an hour to find out what it was that was draining the resource. Combat was pretty awesome and the dialogue was great (sarcasm all the way) and the standalone quests they did deliver were pretty fun and amazing. All in all, Fallout 4 was another disappointing current gen game with amazing highs and crushing lows that ended up underdelivering.

Instead of a son looking for father you have a father looking for his son. Oh and Liberty Prime is back to destroy the communists again. How original.\n\nI also want to point out that at release on my Nvidia GT 610 this game ran very poorly. Obviously it is way under the minimum requirements. I decided to try the game out the other day and I was very impressed with the optimisation done to the game for low end systems. I can now get on terminals without lagging to 2 FPS, I can walk in Corvega Assembly Plant without having to look at dark areas just to save my game from crashing. Yes it will still lag due to diffuse lighting and intense fights, but it is a hell of a lot better than at launch.\n\nFallout 4 is a fun, first person shooter, but it doesn't live up to being an RPG. It takes what Obsidian did to really improve the new Fallouts with Fallout New Vegas and completely disregards it and throws it into a nuclear waste pile. If you are looking for an RPG first FPS second experience then get Fallout New Vegas. If you don't come in here expecting Obsidian/Interplay quality work, and expect the Skyrim experience this game is worth it.\n\nI would probably feel the same way with Elder Scrolls if I had started with Morrowind. I will probably buy the new Elder Scrolls, but then again I didn't look at the series and think RPG I thought open-world FPS. Looks like the Fallout RPG series is dead, hail Fallout FPS.

Is it 80-90 AUD worth of fun? Nope.\n\nJust like many of the other negative reviews this game is pretty much not even fallout. No Karma, No Reputation and No weapon condition. I really wish i couldn't say this but its sorta like skyrim just with guns. Nothing that made the previous fallouts are in this game other than the fallout name on the box.\n\nGameplay wise this game improved in one aspect. Being able to sprint. Thats pretty much it. They turned it into a fps open world game.\nNo rpg element at all. Every decision you make in this game all leads to the same point. Which makes the dialog system ♥♥♥♥ing useless. Might as well have 2 options. "I'll do it later" and "yes".\nFollowers are just annoying and are always in the way.\nBrotherhood of steel where turned into a huge bunch of dbags in this fallout.\nPower Armor is pretty much useless other than for the extra carry weight. The power armor hud was a horrible choice. should have just left it with the regular hud.\nBuilding ♥♥♥♥ is a pain. feeding the povo ♥♥♥♥♥ food and water. Wtf am i your mother? Get your food yourself you lazy ♥♥♥♥.\n\nEnemies are ♥♥♥♥ing easy as ♥♥♥♥. In Nv when you see a deathclaw you usually run for your life. In this you can kill them with the most garbage weapons ever. Even behemoths are a joke. Killing them solo with 10mm pistols at like lvl 15.\n\nPerformance wise the game runs mediocre. Running a 3570k and sc 770 and im dipping into the 30-40 in the dense city areas.\nEdit: Nvm still memory leaks until it hits 6gbs of ram then crashes into a pile of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nBugs wise i haven't seen many but depending on your system you will have some.\n\nAll in all this game is average. Not worth the $80. Would say wait until it price drops but that'll be at least a couple years. Hopefully the dlc will be able to somewhat fix this game up.\n\nIf you have played any of the fallouts before this be wary of buying this.\nBut if this is going to be your first time playing fallout go for it.","November 29, 2015","false","71.0"," 153 of 274 people (56%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","56","153","274","7","10"

Like I said before, I can't go and play this without my brain saying something is fundamentally wrong with this game. While the no level cap looks like a great addition on the part of Bethesda, in reality it basically removed any sort of character stratagy that was in Fallout (this is an RPG, Bethesda wtf). And since there is no level cap, skills could not be implemented without making them far too easy to max out. With no skills, character specialization is rekt, and the leveling process is now "get next perk shooty shooty bang bang".\n\n\nI really want to like this game, I really do. I love Fallout, but Bethesda ♥♥♥♥ed up in ways I never thought possible. Let's just hope they don't pull this with the next Elder Scrolls.\n\n\nOVERALL-6.5/10, good for those hoping for improvement over the godawful gunplay of the previous Fallout games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/recommended/377160/","deathbomb1","Dirk Dickbutt","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deathbomb1/","389 products in account","Fallout 4 is pretty alright I guess.\n\nFallout 4 is a game directed by a tiny leprechaun whom you should never trust, for he will lie to you and steal all of your hard earned gold. Instead you should put your trust in me for I am a kind and honest hobo who will warn you ahead of time before stealing your shoes.\n\nBethesda games seem to be a mixed bag. On one hand they are vast and open and you can spend hours just exploring and rummaging through other people's things. On the other hand they seem to be programmed entirely by interns and have the depth of caked mud. But my opinion doesn't matter to anyone except for me, but since I am never wrong and the best at everything, I'll still puke out words at you until I'm finished. No matter what I say you're still going to buy the game you gullible, attractive, hunk of a man/woman you.\n\nTo be as fair as possible with Fallout 4 is to split this review into two parts, much like the Titanic, I'll start with the bad and then get to the meaty bits where everyone freezes to death. I mean the good parts.\n\nTo start. Yes, a lot of features that have been iconic to the Fallout series since the 90's are gone, which is garbage. Yes, the game sometimes has a hissy fit when you alt-tab, yes a lot of the textures look like I was the one who made them. And yes, the game has no right to run as bad as it does considering MGSV could probably run on a toaster if you asked it nicely enough.\n\nThe main story is also probably the most boring in Fallout history considering at one point you were fighting an army of super mutants led by a crazy meat computer and the other one you were doing battle with the genocidal remnants of the US government who looked rather dashing in their suits of armor.  Looking for your son is like a reverse Fallout 3 where you were looking for Liam Neeson and actually feels like a step back compared to the political cluster ♥♥♥♥ that was New Vegas. The Commonwealth itself also feels cramped and actually kind of primitive compared to their Interplay counterparts. And there's a lot of pointless retconning that only exists because the writers couldn't be asked to use the Wiki. Good job, guys.\n\n“But Dirk, you incredible sex machine vital to the salvation of the human race.” You might inquire. “If you dislike all of that stuff, what do you like about Fallout 4?”\n\nThank you for the compliment.\n\nFirst of all I liked the weapons. Although they took out a good number of them and equipment repairing is gone, the firearms themselves have this really nice, blocky look to them. They look like they fire bullets that can take a man's head off, is what I'm saying. They also added a more in depth weapon customization feature, probably to make up for maintenance being taken out of the game.\n\nThe shooting feels like it was handled by the Machine Game guys, the wizards that conjured Wolfenstein last year. It feels weighty and meaty, making it leagues better than the first person shooting in the last two modern Fallout games. At least in my opinion. It also helps that there's a snap function for cover where you can walk up to a wall and press the aim button to peak around it, giving Fallout 4 a basic, but viable cover system that can help you avoid getting shot in the face. But from what I can tell it doesn't really work with chest high walls and only with walls, though I may be wrong.\n\nI was never a fan of Power Armor in 3 and NV, opting to rather use the Ranger and riot combat armor instead. To me it just felt like putting on a shirt rather than an advanced piece of military hardware and it never made sense to me why you would need training to put on something that was just as floaty as wearing normal armor or clothing. While they took out the need for power armor training in 4, they at least made up for it by making the power armor cool as hell. It works like a vehicle in a way, with frames acting as a base to modify using power armor parts. Fallout 4's power armor not only makes you  taller and larger and more appealing to cute girls, but it also boosts your defense, strength, and other things. Power armor is treated like what you think power armor should be treated like, huge, lumbering death machines that run on communist tears and patriotism.\nI mean fusion cores. Which are made with patriotism and the joy of free American children.\n\nThis is the part where you salute.\n\nThere is also this change halfway through the story mode where The Brotherhood of Steel  invades the commonwealth in search of the Institute, that thing they (I think) talked about in Fallout 3 once or twice. This new element makes it clear that they're going into a military operation and they intend to wage war, and it shows. Boston itself, turns into a quasi Stalingrad of sorts, with mutliple factions fighting from street to street trying to relinquish control from one area to another. With vertibirds flying around, Super mutants, raiders, mercenaries, and soldiers fighting one another for total control, it gives the Commonwealth a real sense of danger and struggle between the factions that fight for control of the ruins that look suspiciously like my bed room.\n\nBethesda games are a mixed bag, you either love them, hate them, or have no strong feelings. I'm part of the third. While I dislike all of the cut corners and lazy design choices they seem to enjoy, when Bethesda does right then they do right. For every mistake or blatant disregard they had for Fallout 4 it's evened out by ideas and changes that just work well with the game they created.\n\nI will admit that Skyrim grated on me after awhile, it wasn't long until the game felt almost empty and boring. but Fallout 4 feels like a pleasant surprise, like a half eaten hoagie in the bottom of a dumpster. Though it's nowhere near the best game in the series because Fallout 2 still exists, it's still just the right amount of good to make up for all the bad.\n\nAlso for some reason some weapons are magical.\n\nDropout 4: High school redemption gets 7 nuclear holocausts out of 10.\n\nHey wait, where's Ron Pearlman?\n\nThe curator: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Dickbuttexperience#\n","January 27","true","99.0"," 46 of 77 people (60%) found this review helpful 23 people found this review funny","60","46","77","23","1"

If you're new to the fallout franchise, you will most likely enjoy this game and get your money's worth. However, I cannot in good conscience recommend this game to any fans of the previous Fallout games. The game is just not as in-depth as previous fallout games. Anyway, I'll write up my review in a series of lengthy pros and cons.\n\nPROS:\n-The combat is just as great as the previous two fallout games. You can be as creative as you want in the ways you kill people. The only thing holding you back is your imagination. And, once again, bloody mess makes its return for those gore enthusiasts.\n-The map size. I've seen many complain that it's small, but I personally think that it's the perfect size. Nearly everywhere you go you'll find something to do, even if it is small. Gone are the days where a mountain takes up a massive chunk of the map.\n-The story. It is rather short, but it has kept my interest so far. I still haven't fully completed it, though, due to the amount of side exploration in the game.\n-The graphics are, in my opinion, very beautiful. On ultra, at least. I haven't tested anything below. Yes, the graphics may look somewhat outdated to some, and they may be different from the other fallout games' graphics, but they are still visually appealing.\n-The voice acting of everyone but the protagonist (I'll get to him in the CONS). I thought the voice actors were really great and fleshed out in this game. The voices perfectly matched up with each character, and each voice had a personality to it. I especially like Curie's french accent.\n\nNEUTRAL:\n-Crashing. I figured I'd put this inbetween, as it does not effect everyone. I haven't had a single crash yet, but others have reported it.\n\nCONS:\n-The bugs. Oh man, the bugs. This game is riddled with tiny (and huge) bugs that varies from player to player. Want to make an expansive settlement where everyone is happy? Too bad! You're not allowed to! There is a widely known bug where your settlement resources (mainly water and defense) reduce to 0 when you're away, which decreases your settlement happiness. As an aside: it doesn't bother me as much as it bothers some, but it's still something that needs to be fixed.\n-The companion AI. The backstories to the companions are interesting, which is something I would have put in the PROS section, but everything else about them is terrible. They do little to nothing in terms of combat. They constantly get in the way (At least you can command them to move). And this may just be happening to me, but my companions seem to be suicidal. They LOVE jumping off of buildings and making me waste a stimpak on them. As always, though, they're great for lugging around useless junk.\n-Voiced protagonist (This is for the male voice actor only. I haven't heard the female). Some like it, most don't. I happen to be in the latter category. I find that it takes away from the immersive roleplaying aspect that was in the previous games. I would be fine with it, though, if the voice actor didn't constantly sound bland and confused. He also speaks in low tones at the most random of times.\n-FPS/Stuttering. Even on top tier machines people are reporting issues with FPS in certain areas, namely cities. My FPS in the wasteland is a constant 60 fps on ultra, but when I walk into a city there's a massive drop in my FPS for a couple seconds.\n-And, finally, we come to the crowning glory of CONS: The dialogue choices. It is the worst of the worst, and it caters only to console players. As opposed to the other fallout games, there are only four options to choose from, and they are almost always the same in every situation: Yes (Bottom. The good choice); No (Right. The bad choice); Maybe/unsure/sarcastic (Left. The neutral choice); Question (Top. Neutral. He simply answers with a question). Not only is there a lack of choices, but there is also a lack of clarity. The choices are almost always one worded (You get the occasional two word choice. Oh my, what a treat!), and you never know what your character is going to actually say based on that choice. He tends to say something completely different from what you\nexpected, and you often times find yourself face-palming at his choice of words.\n\nSo yeah, those are my PROS and CONS for Fallout 4. Decided whether the game is worth it for you or not from them. Or don't. That's cool, too.\n\nTl;dr: The game is good in some respects, but terrible in others. I personally enjoyed it, but there are too many kinks in it at this current time for me to give it a positive review.","November 18, 2015","false","152.0"," 299 of 544 people (55%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","55","299","544","19","10"

This game doesn't have the substance or story to be called such. What it does have, is endless hours of sandboxing fun, and some pretty interesting visual effects to play about with. Never in New Vegas would you launch a Mini Nuke at nothing, simply because the explosion looked cool (or maybe you would, but that's not my point), or never would you stalk enemies for minutes on end just to get a look at them. Think of New Vegas (and 3, fine) as the girlfriend who doesn't look too pretty, but is reliable and has an amazing personality. Fallout 4 is the girlfriend who looks absolutely stunning, but lacks any character whatsoever. You know what, that was a terrible analogy. Simply put, what Fallout 4 lacks in story and character development, it makes up for just by looking cool, and giving you the total freedom to do whatever you want with your character. If you liked the other games, this game is drastically different. Decisions no longer matter, and you don't feel remorse for killing people because they're so shallow.

Fallout has always been one of the game names to elevate my heart rate. Since Fallout 1 I could not wait for the next one to come. Some Fallout memories are as strong as if they were real. Fallout 4 was no different, but now after finishing the game, I can honestly say... I am disapointed. Still looks like Fallout, has a good story, but...\n1) The number of bugs, even in main quest line and most important quest hubs is frustrating.\n2) The game more often than not doesn't know where to lead you to your next Point of Interest either - talking about quest pointer navigation - tells you to go inside location door and once you are inside, tells you to go out again and so on endlessly. Often tells you there is no direct path and that is it, you are on your own. Quest descriptions will not help you much either. Youtube is often the only way to find out WTH is going on there.\n3) The number of endless loading screens made me buy new SSD, so I would not bite my fingers off while waiting.\n\nFinaly and most importantly:\n4) Conversations and replayabile value... More often than not, your conversation choices does not matter, no matter what, the outcome is always the same.\n\nAll in all I would wait for some major discount to get the game. In its curent state it is not wortg £40 and by that time some of the bugs might be already fixed, which will save you a LOT of frustration.","December 16, 2015","false","145.1"," 48 of 81 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","48","81","0","0"

Only took me five attempts to get the Liberty Prime mission to actually function. It's cute that Bethesda thinks they can do mass combat and all, but maybe next time they should do it with an engine that isn't 20 years old and held together with twine, duct tape and prayer.\n\nIt's honestly the least moving, most formulaic ending I've seen in years. Despite the attempt at pathos, there's ... none. There's nothing. 'I'M READY. BECAUSE WAR... WAR NEVER CHANGES.'\n\nIt sums up the game, but not in a good way. It's unintentionally a great way of driving home that you in fact have no agency as a player when it comes to the story, at least. Is this not how "your" character would react? Well, you don't actually have a character. You customize your appearance, but in no meaningful way are you actually making a character. You're Joe Soldier or Jane Lawyer. The people defending this - I don't know. Part of it's blind fanboyism, some of it's this weird drive to maintain the letters 'RPG' because the original Fallout games have them, and I strongly suspect some of it's ignorance from never having played an actual CRPG - just iterations of The Bethesda Game and maybe some JRPGs.\n\nA lot of people defend it on the basis that the combat is better. But "better" in no way means "good". Despite positioning itself as a shooter, Fallout 4 fails as thoroughly as an FPS as it does as an RPG. The combat is simplistic, the weapon balance is a joke, the much-touted mod system is largely just upgrades to damage and scope range and is used to justify a tiny number of base weapons, and one of the only pair of RPG mechanics Fallout 4 retains makes it all the more annoying - enemies are bullet sponges, soaking up dozens of .308 or .50 bullets to go down if they spot you and remove the stealthed damage bonus.\n\nIt's the summer blockbuster of games. It's formulaic, it's flashy, and it's enormously dumb. If you turn your brain off, it can be fun - until the threads start to unravel, until the endless inconsistencies of the world become impossible to ignore, until the tedium of combat mounts, etc, etc, etc.\n\nIt's a game that's going to be utterly forgotten. Almost 20 years later, people still talk about Fallout.\n\nNobody's going to talk about Fallout 4.\n\nNot in a positive way, and not even in a negative way. It's going to leave absolutely no impact whatsoever.","December 3, 2015","false","137.9"," 107 of 190 people (56%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","56","107","190","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VincentSlayer/recommended/377160/","VincentSlayer","Vincentmario","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VincentSlayer/","249 products in account","So I have been playing fallout 4 for a while now and have been reading the reviews. From what I see the game is getting negtive reviews because of... Pretty pathetic reasons. This game, in my opinion, is really good and sure, it did not live up to my expectations all the way but I don't think any hyped game came out 'perfect'.\n\nI think the main problem with the negitive views was the hype. This game was really hyped and for good reason. Years of development and potential was put into this game but people expected this game to be groundbreaking, revoloutionary, a game that everyone can have hours of fun in. But hype is not aways a good thing. Hype rurrined this game. Our expectations were waaaaaaaaaay too high for this game and this is what is making people upset.\n\nReading some of the 'cons' people have written about the game is so pathetic. Most of them are tiny details that honestly don't even matter. I honestly found myself laughing about the complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t the reviewers pulled out of their ♥♥♥♥. Some of my favorates negitive said things are : Big skill tree, people quickly getting out of bed when you talk to them, you can quicky demolish building in editor mode and enimes falling out of the sky.\n\nWhen I started playing, I HATED the new dialouge mechanic. "Only 4 options of converstaions? What a downgrade." But now I have been playing for a while now and honestly, its not that bad. Sure, more options would be nice but its really not much of a big deal.\n\nI am still upset about removal of skill points but I guess I can handle that. I would get a mod if someone will make one.\n\nI do agree the game feels less like a RPG because of removal of skill points, removal of the kama system, ect. On that note I can't BELIEVE they removed the karma system. This was a really bad move in my opinion and removes great role-playing aspects.\n\nFallout is known for being different from other games for its RP aspects. The RP elements is what seperated Fallout 4 from games like Far Cry, Just Cause and lots of other open-world games. Fallout 4 still has lots of RP elements, just not as many as Fallout 1 and New Vegas (Not 1 and 2, entirely different games)\n\nWith all these aspects in mind, I think its good Bethesda done this. Yes, removal of karma, no skill points, removal origonal speech options, ect is all a good thing and for some of them I dont think Bethesda can be blamed for it.\n\nThink about it: If Bethesda kept the dialouge from Fallout 3 the same in Fallout 4, players would call the game out on being too much like fallout 3 and not much improvements. With Bethesda experementing with new dialouge options, they can see what fans like and dislike and with this infomation improve their next games witht he infomation of what works or not. I think this applies to all of the game elements people are upset about.\n\nYes, people say 'Fallout 4 is just a re-hash of fallout 3!' Which i think is complete and utter ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. Say if Bethesda used the old dialouge system, players would call that out of being copied from Fallout 3 and nothing new is being added. So to avoid this, Bethesda tried to add a new dialouge system, different from Fallout 3 and New Vegas so people wont moan that the dialouge system is the same as last time and their is no new content. I think game reviewers are responsible for this. When a game developer tries to make a sequel to a game they try to make it seem differnet to avoid hate.\n\nAlso, why is it a bad thing that Fallout 4 'may' use lots of origonal material from Fallout 3 and New Vegas? Fallout 3 and New Vegas are great games and have lots of elements that would work well in Fallout 4. I dont see why people complain about this. Don't we gamers want a sequel to New Vegas, not a ENTIRE DIFFERENT GAME that removes lots of elements that makes Fallout 'Fallout'. Jesus Christ just because Fallout 4 uses content from its old games does not make it bad its a good thing. Its like if The Elder Scrolls went from a first-person RPG medieval game to a FPS futureistic game. We dont want this!! But apparently we want this in Fallout 4... God.\n\nI still laugh at people complaining about graphics. Those people dont deserve to play video games. Trust me, we DONT WANT a super realistic post-apocalyptic game. We want Fallout, and thats what we got.\n\nMost of the negitive reviews are kinda stupid. Just people moaning about the dialouge system. Kinda annoying.\n\n\nHey, if you read this far, thanks! Sorry for bad spelling and gramma. You see... I don't care.

BLAH BLAH BLAH\ndo cookie-cutters Quests over and over again.\nBLAH-de-blah-blah\n\nForget the issues with the Game Controls FO4 just gets boring after a while.\nClose to finishing and i am not sure i can be bothered\n\n*** Review Updated ***\nThere are some things i like about the game but most of them come with a 'but'\n\nWHAT I LIKE\nThe Atmosphere, the setting, the style BUT honestly, this is just FO3 revamped and given a slight makeover. Hell, they are even using some of the same radio music as FO3 & FO;NV\nThe NPCs in general are pretty damn good, if anything they are what makes the environment more believable BUT the Player Character is a bore, the voice overlay and dialogue system is a joke and the RPG elements are dumbed down. I am supposed to feel for his story but i was given a 5 min intro into that story. The 'emotional bond' i am supposed to feel for my kidnapped son is so weak that chasing after him is less important to me and the story than the next mcGuffin hunt\nUpgrade System - there are some good ideas here and it is one of the few of the 'workshop' aspects of the game i like BUT lets face it, most of the upgrades to weapons and armour are not going to get used, there is a lot of fluff and fill in there.\nWHAT I AM OK WITH\nThe Quests are doable and fit the story and atmosphere BUT they start to stray into 'MMORG' style after a short time. There is little sense in some of the quests apart from - 'go to X, shoot the things, get the mcGuffin and come back for Ca$h Munnies\n\nWHAT GETS DULL QUICK\nThe building system... OMFG every time i have to build a community i feel like i am doing my tax return... this is NOT fun... this is NOT an interesting addition to the game... it feels like a chore as i chuck down a couple of dull prefabs into the small area assigned to me and then whack in a few turrest or stores or whatever... and the funny thing is... i LIKE games like Dwarf Fortress, FOlk Tale, Clockwork Empire and TImber & Stone. I actually bought the game in part BECAUSE of the community building options but it is drab, dull and tedious and adds nothing to the game.\nWHAT I HATE\nLocked keys - keymapping is a basic of any RPG/shooter. I have played with the same key set up for decades. Whoever thought of locking off certain keys from remapping should be fired. Ina  modern game this is atrocious and just lazy coding.For example...\nIf i want to pick up items i need to use 2 separate keys....\nIf i want to craft an object and move it i have to remap my inputs otherwise i cannot position them properly FFS\nAnd who had the genius idea to put... on the f#cking MIDDLE MOUSE WHEEL... the awesome option to drop into 3rd Person? Why would i want to have that for something, you know, USEFUL... like *next* & *last* weapon.\n\nNexus Mods are starting to fix some of the biggest fails with Fallout 4 but honestly i have sort of given up on the game... I will play it later when the mods and fixes make it more enjoyable but this is limp addition to an otherwise excellent franchise.","November 10, 2015","false","109.4"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","29","46","0","0"

You are forced into a linear ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story with an identity that cannot be molded into your own design. Your voice is some annoying ♥♥♥♥♥♥ and you cannot change the voice no matter what race you choose. So if you are black you will still sound like a homosexual white guy. You are forced to be part of a faction in the begining and many characters you cannot kill because you are being forced to play the story they want you to play.\n\nDont even get me started on the dialouge. Lets just put it simply- it will do your head in. Most of the dialouge is pointless time wasting dribble.\nUnappealing companion characters- Yes i know this is opinion based but I dont like any of them. No cool badass characters like "jericho" from Fo3 theyre all just annoying and get in your way and are not combat effective.\n\nPOINTLESS PIPE WEAPONS- Why the flaming ♥♥♥♥ are these crappy, useless weapons in the game?\nGHOULS- went from cool in FO3 to now looking like down syndrome zombies\nSPECIAL WEAPONS- copied skyrim with generic weapons with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ bonus added to it which is usually ineffective. Doesnt change appearance either.\nWEAPONS- Not a very wide variety at all and most appear cartoonish and round and cover a very large portion of the screen which is very annoying limiting your sight. When you holster your weapon it magically dissapears.\nTHE PHYSICS & GORE- Bugged and the ragdoll effects are horrible. The gore and blood has an unrealistic look and feel and just doesnt seem satisying killing people compared to previous games.\nPOOR FRAMES PER SECOND- They devs still need to iron out the crappy code, bottlenecking in condensed urban areas\n\nGame engine is pretty much the same as skyrim which I believe they used from 2007. Feels dated as ♥♥♥♥.\n\nTHE POSITIVE SIDE\nOnly thing that impressed me was survival mode and crafting.\nMODS will hopefully fix alot of the dissapointments but still doesnt change the fact that the game is a dissapointment overall.\n","May 19","false","192.4"," 29 of 46 people (63%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","63","29","46","5","17"

Depends.\nDo you enjoy games that are good?(yes) or I came here because I want to play Fallout 3/NV except 4(no)\n\n\nNon condensed Rant.\nThe first sign of trouble I had when I started playing was that the game took almost 100hours before I had some sort of fatal crash. That made me realize just how different it was to previous games. I remember I had to stop playing, and wait for a patch for NV when it came out, because my game would crash whenever I tried to open doors.\n\nHey, it did take me a less than that to realize that the game was terrible at RPG, yes I could rant about all the 4, yes FOUR choices for everything allways get you to the same conclusion, or the fact that every single conversation goes like this:\n\n>Hey, there pilgrim.\n>>Hey, I have needs that you can satisfy!\n>(Sarcastic) You don't say?\n>>Yes, raiders are eating our babies faster than we can make them.\n>Well that would be at least six billion caps.\n>>mmmm. I can do 250\n>(this one has more choices) 1Yes  2reluctant yes  3 no (yes)  4No(later(yes))\n\nReplayability is nill because by the time you finish you have already done everything that can be done. Yes some quests are mutually exclusive (some late game main quests) not a lot really.\nThe game became a great shooter by emphasizing that, so any build that is not really combat oriented in some way doesn't work. which further reduces the replayability.\n\nStats were dumbed down, that means that instead of being a highly focused god of pickpocketing/stealth or something like that. You are some sort of pre war savant on his way of becoming lord of the wastes (that just means you can level up enough to get all of your stats/perks to max level)\n\nKarma is gone, but surprisingly so is the need to steal anything that is not bolted to the floor. You can be level 50 and just use a highly modified version of whatever gun you got when you were level 5.\nSo there is no need for the stealing then fencing loop of improvement in the previous games.\nYou might still want to take anything you can just so you have enough materials for building, crafting and hoarding.\n\nso even if this is a terrible Fallout RPG it is by far one of the best RPG shooters around. and depending on what you are looking for it is either one of the best games of the year or the worst RPG ever (Fable 3 really)","December 4, 2015","false","183.5"," 148 of 266 people (56%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","56","148","266","18","0"

Then ignore this game and go play Fallout 3 or Fallout New Vegas!\nI don't know why Bethesda decided to turn one of the greatest RPGs into an FPS with no depth and bad writing, but whatever. We'll always have New Vegas.\n\nThis is a long review, so heres the TL;DR: It's a good open world FPS, but I didn't buy an FPS. I bought a Fallout RPG, and it doesn't feel like a Fallout game, and it sure as hell isn't an RPG. So I sadly can't recommend it.\n\n\nOk, Lets Start with the good:\n\nGraphics (10/10): It's a very beautiful and colorful world. Bethesda did a great job listening to fans and creating a more beautiful and alive world.\n\nGameplay (9/10): Combat feels good, shooting free form feels amazing. And the Power Armor! Oh baby the Power Armor! Jumping off an apartment block in Power Armor. Just try it. It's the most satisfying feeling in a Fallout game!\n\n\nContent (4/10): But then.... It just gets boring. Sure the custom weapons and settlements are neat, and yes, it's a huge world. But it's an empty huge world.  There just isn't enough content to keep the game interesting. Once you complete the main quest, theres nothing to work towards, aside from a handful of interesting sidequests, but they are few and far between. Hopefully DLCs and Mods will fix this somewhat, but at the moment, there just isn't enough to do.\n\nThe main faction quests eventually boil down to ''Go here. Kill this group of Synth/SuperMutant/Ghoul. Collect this''.  It gets very tedious, very fast. People don't play Fallout for randomly generated monsters and collecting loot. People play Fallout for the rich world and story, where every choice you make influences the world.  Fallout 4 doesn't have this\n\nCharacters (4/10): How is it possible to make such a vast world with so many different characters so boring? No one is fleshed out. Everyone is bland as hell, even the factions. Characters dont interact enough with you, and other than keep getting on my nerves because they dont like it if I picklock a owned lock. Even the main character is railroaded into specific dialogue and choices. You can't be evil. You can't even be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ unless you ignore all dialogue and just shoot people.\n\nStory (3/10): The story is bad. Yes, for this category ''bad'' is the right term. It feels like very little you do matters.\nI won't go into any detail because of spoilers, but it's just bad.  And Aside from the occasional main questline dialogue line, You never really feel like the character is incredibly attached to his kid, or could be bothered getting him back.  Unlike previous Fallout games, You can't even say ''F*ck this faction crap, i'll do things by myself'' You have to pick a side, which is incredibly frustrating. What's worse is that all the endings are essentially the same. Nothing really changes.\n\nDialogue (2/10): Terrible. Absolutely terrible. Instead of seeing what your character is going to say in full, Fallout 4 adopts a Mass Effect-like system. And sometimes, all four dialogue options result in the same thing! There's no variety!  There is no use of any of your perks or attributes in the dialogs, except charisma. You get a maximum of four dialogue options, all denoted through a few on-screen words that do not always give you a good sense of what will be said next, which is often in no way what is implied.\n\n\nNPC: Will you help me?\n\nCharacter:\n\nYes\nNo (Still forced to do it)\nSarcastic (Yes)\nHuh? (Explanation that leads back to the above options)\n\n\nPicks the "Disagree" option: "YOU ♥♥♥♥ING DUMBASS, THAT'S WRONG AND YOU KNOW IT!!!"","January 30","false","68.0"," 17 of 24 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","17","24","0","0"

But this time they've gone too far, turning the long running RPG franchise into what's essentially a simplistic action game. The game lacks depth. It's overly simplistic. It's horribly dumbed down.

This includes karma, skills, and special quest perks, and choice needs to come back. The game right now feels to linear. I feel like I'm playing COD on the campaign. Everything on the story side is done for me. I really thought I would be able to make more of an impact on the story and my character and the npcs around me. Since there is no karma I cant play a nuetral character like I've done in previous Fallout games.  Dont get me wrong the game looks good but the quests and choices you make are lacking substunance.

Bethesda games have been great "make your own story" simluators. You had a lot of freedom how to respond to NPC, what to say and what to do. The freedom, the biggest best feature of skyrim and earlier fallouts, to play whoever you want to be is simply gone. In favour of a meek fixed choice system and you are preloaded with a defined character. It I am very sad that this time I am not playing my charcter but the one Bethesda thought would be a good one.\n\nIt is a now an open world shooter with "better" but still not great shooting mechanics and what feels gutted character building mechanics.\n\nIs it still a fun game? Hard to say. I spent as much time with this as I have trying to get to the point "When it gets better", it just never got there.

But it is SOOOOO boring and too FPS to be considerd an RPG. I have played all the Fallouts up to this one; Fallout 1, 2, 3, New Vegas and even Tactics. And truth be told, I'd rather play the olde rFallouts than this. In fact, I actually will once I've written this review. There are some good features in this game, but their isn't a lot.\n\nPROS\n> The Commonwealth wasteland is vast and quite beautiful to look at and explore.\n>Armour and weapon crafting.\n>Visually looks nicer and less bland grey than in Fallout 3.\n>Piper... 'nough siad.\n>The power armour is fantastic. It is like an Iron Man suit and a vehicle, not just another metal armour set.\n>The shooting has vastly been improved... even if its that all they ♥♥♥♥ing focused on in the entire game!\n\nThats it.\n\nCONS\n>No karma system\n>No skills\n>No traits\n>Talking character.\n> Rubbish dialogue system\n>Uninteresting characters. Hell, Fallout 2 has more interesting characters and the Enclave speech still holds up today.\n>Settlement construction and management  and how it is piled onto you in quests, even if you don't want to do it.\n>Lots of Fallout 3 features are gone (Weapon and armour maintainance, karma, skills, perks and so on)\n>Not an interesting story. The factions, even the mighty Brotherhood of Steel, are just bland, and there is no depth put into the conflict in the game\n>Feral Gouls. F**k, I hate them in this game!\n>Crappy AI path finding.\n>Glitches. Some are funny when first seen, but after awhle, they just get annoying to see.\n>Extremely repeatative quests (Kills something, return OR kill something, find something and build settlement, then return)\n>Preston. Go save those settlements yourself you lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥!\n>The suicider mutants.\n>The higher level bosses that recharge their health near death! GAAAAAAAAAAH!\n>The power armour battery pack drains too quickly.\n>The radio station is just abysmal to listen to; from the repeatative use of (good, but overdone) songs from Fallout 3 and a crap radio presenter who reports ONE of your quest actions across the wasteland and stutters too much.\n\n\nOverall, this game is fun to play for just a few minutes, but I would not recommend playing this game for longer. Its just boring and grinds on. In truth, play this game when decent mods come out, like Fallout 3's FWE mod or New Vegas' Project Nevada pack which may hopefully add the RPG elements back into the game. But overall, just stick with the other Fallouts for a better RPG and story experience.","January 27","false","79.6"," 24 of 37 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","24","37","0","0"

HOWEVER MY REVIEW STAYS NEGATIVE FOR THE REASONS LISTED BELOW FOR THE AVERAGE JOE WHO DOESN'T USE NMM, USES STEAM WORKSHOP, OR IS PLAYING ON CONSOLE.***\n\n*I'm sorry for the super long review but with the addition of this new patch I couldn't keep quiet any longer*\n\nI don't care if most people dont like this game because it doesnt't feel like recent fallout games. I still love this game.\n\nI was able to look past the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ dialogue system\n\nI was able to look past the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ never original "Legendary" Weapons that replaced unique guns from past fallouts rewarded to you for exploring.\n\nI was able to look past the sub par generic ♥♥♥ story.\n\nand finally I was able to look past the bug towards the middle of the Far Harbor DLC during the puzzle sections that prevented me from progressing and the only way i got past it was because i spent a half hour deleting blocks using console commands and reloading my game more than i could count.\n\n\nAbove all else despite all those problems I still had fun with this game. However with this new patch they have established I have to put my foot down AND NOT RECOMMEND this game. And it pains me to do so, and here's why;\n\nThis new patch now has the forced feature of adding a mods section in the games main menu. Which would be fine if it wasn't forced on you. (I will be using the term "FORCED" a lot in this review) The game now forces you to go to the mod section of the menu AND MANUALLY SELECT ALL OF YOUR PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED MODS THAT YOU WANT LOADED INTO THE GAME. Why is this a problem? Well if you people are anything like me you have a lot of mods, so i spend literally 5 minutes spamming the down and enter keys selecting all of my mods EVERY TIME I START UP THE GAME so i can play with my mods and there is noo way to save your mod load so you HAVE TO do this everytime you start up fallout.\n\nTo add insult to injury the game HAS TO RELOAD ITSELF TO PLAY YOUR LOADED MODS so it has to load for another 10 minutes just so you can play with your mods.

There's very few ammounts of gun types but mods are supposed to make up for that. So instead of a 10MM a new gun is considered a 10MM with a scope. That's not a new gun, Bethesda. Also theres few armor types in the game and yet again the armor layers are supposed to make up for that.\nThe perk system makes no sense either. There was nothing wrong with skills so no reason to remove them. What we get instead is a subpar system that makes no sense.  and the placement of the perks makes no sense\nlike some feel too high on the list others feel too low some I feel are in the wrong catagory, Most are just +damage\nmost you need to put allot of points into to get anything useful like robotics expert 2 makes it..what attack you?.. uh, ok. 3 to command it. Thats 3 whole points for what 1 should do.  There is no connection between perks and attributes. Oh you want to do more damage with weapon x? You should have picked the other stat then! Sorry! Also, as I said before with placement, Look at where the toughness perk is on Endurance. It's level -1- meaning someone with 1 endurance vs someone with 5 can have MORE damage resistance simply because of the perk being at level -1-. They dont feel placed in the right areas and if you really want my opinion on this the system just doesn't work. I would GREATLY prefer the old game's skill system.\nThe power armor system is nice but the putting a timer on it and making it this OP vehicle you get into is just silly. Would greatly prefer the old system of PA being just strong armor instead of this OH CRAP button.\nThe craftng and building is nice but the components for crafting make no sense. There's no screws in cars of alarm clocks? And a car has as much asteel in it as three pistols? What?\nFallout 4 is not a BAD game but it's not something I'd recommend for $60 It's a VERY medicore experience and feels empty and shallow compared to vanilla New Vegas even.","November 15, 2015","false","10.9"," 45 of 76 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","45","76","3","0"

There isn't any denying that. But my main complaint is that it's a bad fallout. Fallout 4 took one step forward in gameplay (i.e. animation, movement, combat) and a step backward on every other aspect.\n\nThe voiced protagonist really take more than it adds. Some of the lines are voiced horribly/cringy. The backstory is the frontrunner in why I've come to really grown to dislike this game. Instead of being a vault dweller, you're a concerned dad/mom trying to save their racially dynamic child from the hands of the commonwealth. Each conversation ends with you agreeing to do whatever task the NPC's have assigned. There isn't any slack given for options. 90% of the time you'll end up shooting/slashing your way through a place just because someone asked you to. Despite Bethsda's efforts, the world feels completely dead. Aside from parts of Boston & tiny rural farms, every location is another shooting range that respawns after a few ingame days.\n\nThe art style honestly just pisses me off. They've completely ditched the previous games styles for something that resembles a scifi based during the prohibition. Would it have killed them recreate the G3/AR-10 instead of replacing them with some WWI watercooled HMG?\n\nThe amount of modifications doesn't balance out the lack of weapon diversity. After a few hours of playing you'll realize that you've seen everything Fallout 4 has to offer.\n\nFallout 4 feels like it's the Infinite of the Bioshock series. Some people will like it, but those who have played previous  games are left with a bitter taste (go away NMA posters).\n\nI really hope Obsidian (If they even make the next game) will make everything right for the next installment.","December 10, 2015","false","264.2"," 18 of 26 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","18","26","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nommynomm/recommended/377160/","nommynomm","Nommy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nommynomm/","313 products in account","Fallout 4 is, in the simplest of reviews, worth playing. Whether you're a die hard Fallout fan or new to the series, you'll likely play a few hours and feel like your money was well spent.\n\nThere are many amazing things about the newest installment in this prolific series, but some experienced fans the franchise might feel that the cons outweigh the pros. For me personally, somewhat of a casual, I find myself eager to punch out every day so I can get some quality time in the wasteland.\n\nTL;DR, if you're here for the gun play, the graphics, crafting, character builds, or constructing one hell of a base of operations, FO4 will be your jam. On the other hand, if you're here mostly for the lore, character development, immersive interaction with the world, or the "choose your own adventure" feel that previous titles in the franchise delivered, you might want to take a step back, firmly grasp your expectations and pull them down quite a few notches, or pass on this title entirely for now.\n\nWhat's Good\nWeapons, Armor, and Crafting - This is where FO4 really shines. Modular weaponry and armor has added so much depth to the mechanical side of Fallout. Being able to tweak your favorite weapons to your exact specifications and play style is a treat only moders are used to indulging in, but Bethesda gave us an OEM experience we can all enjoy. Armor is nearly the same way, however not as modular as weaponry in a vanilla (read: unmodded) build. This ultimately gives you the feeling that your loadout is truly yours. One interesting aspect is that nearly every single item you pick up in the wasteland has a use in crafting.\n\nPower Armor on the other hand... Holy fission-powered-mechs, Fat Man. Power Armor is no longer just dead weight in your inventory when not in use. It's a full, standalone mechanized vehicle that you can craft, customize, and drive. The animation while entering/exiting the armor is almost as addicting as actually using it out in the Commonwealth to lay waste to the unholy abominations that dare cross your path.\n\nCombat - That brings us to the more actionable side of the above. Combat in Fallout 4 feels pretty similar to previous installments in the 3D era of the franchize, but overall does it much better. The engine feels much smoother, the gunplay more natural, and the enemies more life like. Enemies have actual AI, taking cover at appropriate times, coordinating their efforts, and overall effectively laying waste to anyone who dares venture outside the confines of their vault. Whether you're addicted to V.A.T.S., or a 1st/3rd person purist, Fallout 4 has a lot to offer you in the combat department.\n\nSettlement Building - When you're tired after a long day of injecting as much lead, laser burns, or teddy bears (yes, teddy bears) as possible into your irradiated opponents, there's much to be done at home. Protecting settlements, satisfying its settlers, and most importantly, building them entirely adds a whole new (optional) experience for Fallout fans. I honestly had a bit of difficulty determining if building belonged in the pros or the cons, but in the end, it's a winner in my heart.\n\nDespite the clunky, snap-based building mechanics that are often difficult, yielding arbitrary behavior, and frequently downright frustrating, being able to craft your own home in the wasteland (along with the homes of many, many others) is one of the most rewarding experiences I've had so far with the game. Admittedly even in my first playthrough, I rely heavily on mods to truly deliver the building experience I craved. But that's the beauty of Bethesda games - the modding community will always be there to more than make up for Beth's shortcomings.\n\nGraphics - The wasteland, both pre and post war, looks astonishing. Lighting and scenery really takes Fallout to a crazy new level in this installment. The shadows remain blocky and artificial up close, and the urban areas are about as optimized as any 1st world government, but I can't help but find myself just looking around and taking in the scenery. Attention to detail is something Bethesda has always done well, and here they do not disappoint.\n\nWhat's Bad\nUser Interface - No surprise here. Fallout 4 is yet another game designed for console and lazily ported to PC with little to no attention to the user interface during the change over. Clunky UI and menus, awful inventory management, and an overall "I should have a controller" feel to everything but controlling the character itself is getting old.\n\nCharacters and World Interaction - One thing we've all gotten used to in Fallout is the ability to shape our own character, and define how we're presented to the other people in the world. Want to play the fool? Do it! Want to be a completely evil jerkface? Do it! Want to play the hero everyone knows and loves? Here's your cape and exterior-underwear, friend!\n\nWell, you can kiss all that goodbye in Fallout 4 where you're restricted to playing the hero only. The way you act has no effect on the world nor its inhabitants. You're limited to 4 paraphrased responses in every single interaction and the magic of making choices is entirely dead. Aside from simply building homes, you no longer shape the world; you simply follow along and take orders, peering through the eyes of a protagonist that speaks on your behalf. This not only severely cripples what many find critical to their FO experience, but it pretty much eliminates any replay value the game could have had.\n\nIt might also be worth noting that the voice acting so far has felt very uninspired and rushed. I often find myself paying attention to the quality of the VA vs the content of their words.\n\nIn conclusion…\nAs mentioned above, I love playing FO4. At the time of this writing, I’ve logged only a mere 20 hours but see myself packing in at least another 80-100 more. Not only is the mostly-vanilla experience enough to keep me hooked, but the incredibly massive modding community will drive this thing home, clearly marking it as worth the 60 caps for me.\n\nIf you find yourself feeling like exceptional mechanics and gameplay can't make up for a lack of character development and the ability to shape your own adventure, you might want to pass on this title. At least until DLC and/or the modding community gets involved.","March 17","true","39.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","2"

The reason i say this is because i personally was waiting for fallout 4 after seeing the trailers and hearing from word of mouth however as the inital wave of excitment wore over in the 10 hour mark of the game and was past the requirements for a refund i was stuck with the sub-par fallout experience. What disappointed me the most was the dumbed down approach to make the game more "accessible" to players who aren't used to free world rpgs. On the other hand, the game has refined gunplay and shooting mechanics that make sniping easier without the use of vats and the introduction of the settlements despite them being weak at the moment. Then again the new dialouge system and pointless skills that serve as the only means to "level" your character makes me not want to recommend this game to those who loved fallout new vegas, but i would recommend it if you can pick it up on sale.

There is (somehow) less feeling of depth than Skyrim and the NPCs and companions are less interesting and feel even less real (again, somehow worse than Skyrim.) with the exception being Nick Valentine, being one of the most interesting characters I've seen in a Bethesda game.\n\nMake no mistake, this isn't an RPG. This is a shooter with light RPG elements sprinkled on in the same way that Skyrim isn't an RPG, it's a fantasy-adventure game with RPG elements sprinkled on.\n\nI find the most egregious part of this game to be the randomly generated quests and settlements in general. The quests are endless if you keep going to Preston and there are three types of quests related to this:\n1) This Settlement is under attack.\n2) Kill all the enemies in this "nearby" location to a settlement\n3) A settler as been kidnapped to this "nearby" location\n\nIt's worth noting 2 and 3 are pretty much one in the same as they use the same locations and I've even gotten the same location a number of times in a row for these sad excuses for "quests." I also put "nearby" in quotes because I've gotten quests from settlers saying raiders or some other type of enemy is camped out nearby and harassing the settlement only to travel more than halfway across the map. On top of that, if you can get away from Preston after turning in a quest and before he gives you another (because it's automatic) eventually you'll get a warning on your Pipboy that a settlement is under attack anyways and if you ignore that, damage is done to the settlement. So unless you want your settlements getting messed up, you're constantly strong-armed into saving them, constantly distracting from your exploration or questing. Some get messed up so fast there's no time to go save them unless you immediately drop what you're doing to go save them.\n\nFurthermore settlement system itself seems like it was tacked on at the very last minute with incomplete tilesets, a strange lack (and selection) of objects to build, bizarre boundary and placement restrictions, an extremely finicky snapping system, odd restrictions on what you can or can't remove from a settlement (for example, some structures and objects such as beds or part of a house in an inconvenient position) and absurd material requirements for the inventory space you get. This game is already tedium incarnate, but trying to get materials for all these settlements with the inventory limitation is insane. And no, I'm not calling for the removal of the carry weight limit. The whole settlement construction system feels like what you'd expect from a modder, not a professional Triple A game developer.\n\nThe weapon modding system is actually pretty great and it does seem like there was effort put into this and I wish more games that have weapon modding had this level of choice.\n\nThe dialogue system felt like the most lame and flaccid way to interact with characters in the world. Every conversation turns into a mini-cutscene as you get up to four responses to any statement: Typically just a Yes or No type statement and usually some form of further questioning or sarcastic reply. Most times it doesn't seem to matter which you pick. It's like how in Telltale games no matter the choices you make always leads to the same conclusion. So many conversations are like this, like the one when you first reach Diamond City between the Mayor and Piper. I got the exact same response for picking all four dialogue options. Why even give the option if it changes nothing? Angry Joe showed this particular conversation in his YouTube review and only showed two of the four responses. All four come out with the exact same response. This system also does not show exactly what your character is going to say and is often really unclear. I've picked what I thought was a genuine response only to find out it was some snarky sarcasm. This also takes away some of the more amusing dialogue choices from previous games such as Fallout 3.\n\nWhat few puzzles that are in this game, like Skyrim's puzzles, felt like they were designed for toddlers. While Skyrim had the insultingly easy picture matching puzzles, the only real puzzle I've encountered was involved in finding the Railroad faction. What is supposed to be a secret underground group that is difficult to find consists of following a very clear and obvious red line and spelling out the faction's name on a rotary disk.\n\nThe factions are all completely uninteresting and stupid. The Brotherhood feels like they were pointlessly shoehorned in this game because there needed to be some sort of connection to the rest of the series and this time they've taken on a far more militaristic role and are intent on waging war just because. The Railroad felt useless, like their only reason to exist was to help with one very specific instance in the main story. The Institute likewise felt stupid in that they were propped up to be this big evil villain, but we hardly see or get much motivation to go after them except for the fact that they kidnapped your son. I would also like to point out the absurdity of their whole base of operations being this beautiful pristine facility with technological wonders in a world where everything has to be scrapped and salvaged and the availability of the energy needed to run such a place would be impossible to attain.\n\nI wanted to finish this game before writing my review, but in all honesty I just couldn't take it anymore. I find there to be little of interest to this game and none of the hooks that kept me playing previous Bethesda titles like Oblivion, Fallout 3, New Vegas (yeah, I know Obsidian did it) and especially Morrowind. Even Skyrim kept my interest long enough for me to finish the main story and faction questlines despite how boring it was.\n\nTotalBiscuit once described Skyrim as an ocean with the depth of a paddling pool. I'd go a step farther to say Fallout 4 is an ocean with the depth of a puddle.\n\nNo, the fact this game can be modded isn't an excuse for the problems I've mentioned and no amount of modding can save the base game.","February 14","false","114.5"," 26 of 41 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","26","41","3","6"

Mods can't fix poor pacing; mods can't fix bad writing; mods can't fix an uninteresting story.\n\nSure, New Vegas' gameplay wasn't perfect, but I've spent a lot of time modding it to get it just right and I think I may have recently succeeded. Why? Because New Vegas has well-developed characters, great pacing, excellent writing, and a truly deep and thematically-significant story that gives the player TONS of freedom to do as they please. Fallout 4 is the opposite: its combat is pretty good for an FPS, but its story feels forced and rushes the player, its characters are (save for the companions) completely forgettable, and the player has absolutely no choice in determining what sort of person they want their character to be.\n\nNew Vegas felt like a believable post-apocalyptic society that existed independently from the player. Fallout 4 feels like a game world where everything exists just to provide the player with things to kill and ways to make their pretend numbers get bigger.\n\nAlso, way to make it so incredibly obvious that being able to play as a woman was a complete afterthought. "What's that, you want your female sole survivor to be a veteran too? TOO BAD, she's a lawyer, so she doesn't get the story opportunities and interactions with NCPs that Badass Male Main Character would, and because we care soooo much, sometimes her companions will call her 'Sir'. Don't worry though; we made sure bandits will call her '♥♥♥♥♥'."\n\nOn the plus side, Fallout 3 is no longer the worst game in the series.","May 12","false","7.9"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","13","17","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Souperzombie/recommended/377160/","Souperzombie","BOSH BOSH BOSH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Souperzombie/","517 products in account","This game is... somewhat of a mixed bag. I guess it's fun, but compared to Bethesda's other games it is completely inferior in every possible way.\n\nCombat feels very weak compared to the last games, despite it being improved with several new features such as a melee attack with a ranged weapon, a grenade button, and overall faster and more intense gunplay, but it just doesn't have the finesse that the other games had. It simply feels like another generic first-person shooter with no features that distinguish it from other FPS games, and because you no longer build your character's skill with weaponry by levelling up (because there aren't any skills) and because your character is always proficient with all weaponry, regardless of what it is, it just further reinforces this. Oh, and just because there's a "canonical reason for it", it doesn't make it a valid excuse.\nVATS has become a worthless feature. Because the combat is somewhat faster you'll probably need to be at least a bit lighter on your feet, and the VATS system puts you at a complete disadvantage. You aim at an enemy with it, time does notstop, your hit chance is lower than it would be if you weren't using VATS, and you leave yourself vulnurable to attack as the animation of you standing there and shooting plays out. However unlike in the last game, when you hit an enemy in VATS it charges a Critical hit meter (Critical hits don't seem to be random anymore, which I guess is fine), but it just feels like another worthless feature, as all it does is give you a single hit of double damage. Nothing more, nothing less. Absolutely no point to it at all. There is a perk that allows you to 'store' critical hits, but unless your going for a specialised playstyle (which is a pointless endeavour), there's still not a lot of point to doing so.\nThe Perk system. Oh, good god, where do I begin? There are only 10 levels of perks in total, all of which have seperate ranks that need additional levels in order to progress in that perk further, and there are no skills. Because of this the freedom you have over building your character is EXTREMELY limited, but it also goes against the entire nature of the game. Remember in New Vegas where your strength and skill levels dictated what weaponry you could carry and use efficiently? It both made sense and encouraged players to refine and shape their character to suit whatever build or preference you desired. In F4 there are no such limitations, and that makes things boring. Any weapon you find you are automatically a master with, with no exceptions. Sure, you can choose perks which make you a bit stronger with certain weapons, but because you're automatically brilliant with all weapons there's truly no reason to do so, not even for damage bonuses; You're just forced to use whatever weapons the game throws at you. No longer are you the character you want to create; you are ALWAYS a character that the game has made for you and forced you to play. You don't get to shape your character or watch him/her grow in experience and become stronger, because that's not how the game works.\nWeapon modding is... egh. I've mixed feelings on it. It's certainly interesting, I'll give it that, but it can also be tedious as all hell. Rather than buying and installing distinct weapon modifications like you do in F:NV, you instead build the mods yourself using various types of junk from the wasteland by breaking said junk into raw materials. As a result you spend much less time adventuring around the world than in ALL other Bethesda games, as the amount of objects you can carry is compromised. In all other Bethesda games you adventure around the world killing enemies and taking their weaponry and possibly armor as loot to sell, and because crafting didn't take up too much inventory space it was not much of a hassle to be able to both carry loot and materials used for crafting. You can scour your way through several areas in older Bethesda and have fun with it, games Because your inventory space is compromised with junk you have to go back to your house, deposit the junk and/or sell your loot, and resume adventuring. While you can mark junk items that contain the specific resource that you need, there is, once again, no point to doing so, as there's no true way of knowing what weaponry you could acquire in the future and what materials it will need for modding, and unless your OCD enough to keep a document detailing what junk contains what amount of whatever resource and what weapons use what weapon mods that need whatever resources, it's generally best to just pick up anything that isn't only steel.\nSettlements. Just... Ugghhhhhh. It seems to me like the only point of this is for building up the area you start in for a tiny bit of quest XP and breaking down objects in the world such as destroyed cars and trees for resources. I have not once been compelled or given any reason to build a settlement in any other area in the entire world. There truly seems no reason to do so at all.\nI thought the pathfinding in Bethesda's other games was shoddy, but HOLY HELL IS IT FRUSTRATING NOW. You have no idea how many times I've had to follow someone only for them to just stand in a doorway doing NOTHING, or for my idiot companions to stand on a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ mine AND NOT GET OUT OF THE WAY WHEN I TELL THEM TO SO I CAN DISARM IT. Every single companion in the game, including that unbelievebly stupid dog, are nothing but a burden and an inconvinence. They get in the way all the time and are only useful for carrying your junk. Fortunately there is a perk that increases your damage and carry weight when you don't have a companion, which is all the more reason not to have them around. At least the terrible AI helped me kill a deathclaw because it got stuck behind a short wall, so there's that...\nThe power armor... well, I guess the new system does makes sense and it sets it apart from other armors which I do like, but it just doesn't work in a game like this. Because F4 can throw super-strong enemies at you out of nowhere, you rarely know when or where you're going to need power armor unless you're following a guide, which is boring. And you can't wear power armor constantly because it runs on power cores which are rather limited and expensive, so unless you've got a lot of cores to spare you're going to spend a lot of time hulking around a suit of unpowered metal. Almost the only times I wear power armor is when I find one sitting around in the wasteland, which is rarer than the cores they run on.\nThe dialogue. Oh, good lord, the dialogue. You'd be forgiven for thinking that this game is a comedy, because the dialogue in this thing IS ONE OF THE MOST PATHETIC THINGS I'VE EVER HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF OBSERVING WITH MY OWN TWO EYES. I can't accurately describe it. It's even worse than Fallout 3, for christs sake. It's like if Mass Effect was written by a toddler. It can get truly, truly cringeworthy at some points. On top of that, you DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOUR CHARACTER IS GOING TO SAY. YOU DON'T GET TO CHOOSE YOUR CHARACTER'S DIALOGUE ANYMORE. You just get vague headers, such as "Sarcastic" or "Question", and therefore you have no idea what consequence your words are going to have until you've already said them. It's truly laughable. And not in a good way.\nThere are no true unique weapons. At all. One of my Favorite things about Bethesda games was collecting all the unique items I could and displaying them around my house, and I'd talk about it more in-depth but I'm all out of space. Phooey.\nDespite the myriad of flaws this game has, I'm still having fun with it, but that's probably because I'm the kind of person who shuts off their brain while playing games. All in all, if you're a fan of Bethesda games you might like this, but don't be expecting  any kind of gold.","November 15, 2015","false","207.7"," 56 of 97 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","56","97","2","0"

However, they took too much inspiration from other genre's and inserted them into this game far too poorly to be considered a good finished product.\nThe RPG aspects of the game have been far too dumbed down for a role playing game. The dialogue branches all follow the same path with very few conversations having any variety. The player character's leveling doesn't feel like a reward nor does it feel like any progress. Instead, leveling your character after a certain point becomes the "Perk Grind" kind of like skyrim, but at least in skyrim you were able to train particular skills by using them.\nNext, the combat in the game is very stale, and while the development team did a great job of making a good shooter, yet they still kept vats as the primary mode of combat by omitting criticals while outside of vats and including perks that make vats so brokenly overpowered that anyone who invested into luck based perks can activate their win button to trump anyone in almost any fight.\nThe weapons look bad and have terrible sound effects, none of the firearms feel good. Additionally, all of the weapons being left handed for a right handed operator is a terrible design choice. I would have preferred a left haded shooter firing these weapons, it would have been less annoying to look at. And to top it all off the firearms still feel like peashooters, especially when playing the "Totally challenging" survival mode. It's not so much survival as just dealing with the crap that the glitches and bugs in this game can bring which destroy any sense of enjoyment.\nI'm not going to defend myself from those individuals who would claim "nostalgia blindness" has taken over me, as it hasn't, if I wanted to play the older fallouts I would. But, that is not the case I wanted to immerse myself in the next story in the fallout series, but not a story that feels as though it is simply a fanfiction.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InnerConflict/recommended/377160/","InnerConflict","InnerConflict","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InnerConflict/","291 products in account","All the factions are boring and dull. All characters are ♥♥♥♥ except maybe strong and codsworth. Most weapons look and feel like ♥♥♥♥ even though they actually play kinda nice once you modded them. The story is ♥♥♥♥, the graphics are decent, dont hate too much on it really, but I seriously think it needs modding done a lot. The bugs are present but not that bad this time around, than previously. Everyone who spends most time building something instead of exploring or adventuring in this game is a complete F in a test, missing the whole meaning of this game series. Fallout 4´s dialogue is the worst bethesda has ever made and is acted worse than most indie rpg´s . The bulletspongeyness once you go hard or surviva difficultyl is ludachris and needs modding and once you try to manage your inventory you stopped playing this game already because of it´s monotone repetitiveness. Fallout 4 literally has not the traders economy balanced out enough. So you just hold all your hrs spend selling crap to ten thousand different traders or scrapping them on the workbench. Fallout 4 is a disaster for fallout fans and watered down to appeal to a bunch of newcomers. A game like this doesn´t need much and once you overwater it with crap, like Fallout 4 does, it feels bland, out of balance and just boring. A few quests are great,  some can be good, a few are bland, but most are outright embarassing. Combine that with worthless dialogues and crappy characters and your rpg turns into a dull shooter which doesn´t even compare to a proper shooter or RPG. The only thing appealing to me were the many places to visit and the many random encounters. The hideouts and environmental stories told secretly through journals and so on, just as fallout always did were good. I already wasted 18 hrs my lifetime doing the mainquest and side quests and exploring and I couldn´t keep myself to enjoy anymore of it. I felt satisfied enough nor shall you expect you can endure such crappy game designs either. I deleted it off of my library. I´m too ashamed to possess it.\n\n\nMy review more cynical:\n\nYou know f   u   c   k   i  n  g what, 13 year old russian kids modding on the creation engine have more talent at texturing, art design and story writing than bethesda ever will. You could slap a dead dogs body across the floor and drown your face in the rotten blood of it and have a more plesant experience with that, than trying to fix the r   e   t  a  r  d  e  d vegetable mouse controls and optimization.\n\nMy fix guide for Fallout 4:\n- Buy a   l   c, d   r   u  g  s and h  o  o   k  e  r  s and die before you need to choke on that ladyboys c    u    m called gimped dialogue.\n- RPG... shooter with rpg elements it is now.... probably mostly was... ever... fanboys... so just wait for others to fix it or fix it yourself by avodiing s   h   i   t   t   y gameplay elements such as overpowered power armor. Survival my a     s    s....\n- Burn your f    u   c  k  i  n   g  c   o  c   k down. It helps taking away the focus from the foggy godrays and eye cancerous depth of field.... if you want to disable mouse smoothness that is of course... Gamehas some nasty a  r  s  e optimization.\n\nYou want a real fallout experience? Follow my guide and enter the asylum of your choice, if you even have one and feel the games most agonizing parts in real life. Way better than f   u  c  k  i  n  g  VR.\n\nHere is how I enjoy fallout 4: Tweak until it crashes, fix it until it works, hit your PC like it´s a damn slave and sell your liver for a   f    u   c  k  i  n    g s  h  i   t   ton of weapons, ammo and radioactive material from the darknet too. Buy that s   h  i    t anonymously on the darknet with bitcoins. Meet the guy and toss todd howard into a river. Storm the Bethesda HQ as a super mutant and free codsworth. Have a blast and let someone else get the fallout brand and license. Future Issues solved.\n\n- Technically seen the game is just trash obviously. Shadow pop ins even on ultra, bad optimization, mediocre animations, etc etc so on and so forth it goes on as any bethesda game, even skyrim sucked in technical terms. My Phenom II X9 OWNED every Intel back in 2010 and my 460 was solid enough and yet.... YET .. ♥♥♥♥ THIS, JUST ♥♥♥♥ THIS!\n- The whole economy is crap. The traders never have enough money for all the ♥♥♥♥ you can collect in order to sell... It´s more work than fun having your ♥♥♥♥ing ridicliously  idiotic inventory cleaned up by running to 10 different traders. I´m speaking about useless high quality gear and not about junk which you store away in the workbench anyway. Economy is ♥♥♥♥ed.\n-No character except maybe Strong is likeable, most good characters were scrapped from F3 anyway. Codsworth etc. You are in diamond city and after you go back for the 10th time you are so sick of that place. What a bunch of lifeless, non talkable, badly written, embarrassingly executed citizens.\n-This seems to be not even worth the seal of being a RPG anymore. The dialogues are shameful, without a mod you can forget having proper input as to what to say. The mass effect emotion 4 direction dialogue options aren´t meant for every game, especially not bethesda games and they completely break the game. SO WHY!?!?!?!  Especially if most dialogue options are said or spoken in bland sarcasm, denial, cynicism or plain unintelligent (with 10 points invested into Intelligence). Often.. no. Most of the time the outcome is the same no matter what option you take. It´s so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ useless!\n-Cities are so empty. Maybe 2 or three buildings you can enter and find some stupid crap gear or safes. Some places are meant to be nice and give youa real fallout charme, but diamond city, villages... all are crap´. No advancement. You enter 2 or 3 buildings... and find yourself wondering why we can´t enter more! It´s 2015!!!! The only places worth mentioning are the hidden environmental quests like with lakes and cabins or big quest buildings like universities, sewer systems, etc. Fallout 4 is merely Fallout 3 with some updates and worse story.\n-Tiresome fights turning boring when without proper fun gear. Mini nukes, miniguns and ♥♥♥♥ combined with power armor are nice and the way to enjoy that game, but somehow... fallout wasn´t always about being a idiotic kindergarten group shooting with ridicliously strong weapons. There is no balance for proper stealth players nor other playstyles as much as for the wild rambo. The AI got improved, first time stealth isn´t totally clunky in this series and still sucks. Despite the embarrassing difficulty scaling on survival difficulty which is the only difficulty worth playing as it has legendary loot dropping regularily. 50% Player DMG and what.. 200? 400? Enemy DMG... forces one to use FUELED POWER ARMOR. URGH. Bulletsponges incoming. Wasting precious ammo on enemies... breaking any meaning of ♥♥♥♥ing survival. Survival COMBAT isn´t survival at all. They broke their own gameplay design by casualizing a non casual series.\n-Unplayable mouse input and movement lag + ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ UI ( huge space when viewing the pip boy but nearly none of it is used to increase the pip boys screen.... maybe make it a higher tec pip boy. New generation? It´s the commonwealth vault tec version... who da♥♥♥♥ knows... get some ideas bethesda or just ♥♥♥♥ing make a good game....)\n-I take a huge ♥♥♥♥ on that childishly bad settlement system. Fallout 3 PC mods did it better.\n-Next gen mod support I can see.... So we still need to use ♥♥♥♥ing mod managers. Get your ♥♥♥ up Shitworks.\n-How can it be harder to fight a ♥♥♥♥ing bobfly on survival due to it´s speed and fast attacks than a legendary rad scorpion? ♥♥♥♥ man! I still can´t believe even the most simple difficulty scaling job was done so badly...","November 27, 2015","false","18.9"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","4"

There is not much to do in the way of quests, it seems like they traded out a lot of the quests for random settlements that you can build in, which got real boring very quickly. It feels like NV had 10x as many quests, i could go play NV again and get another 150-200 hours of gameplay without DLC. This feels like 70% of a game, made as a platform for DLC. The games story feels small, like nothing important or exciting happens. The dialogue is crap, the other games had great funny responses, this game is Yes, Sarcastic Yes, No,and I dont know.

Not huge ones, but just a few small ones.\n\nBy no means is this a bad game, It is absolutely amazing, It has given me ridiculous amounts of hours of entertainment, I was obsessed with it, I stopped playing several others games I was fond of because of it.\nIt truly is a masterpiece, but it's disappointing and no, I don't mean it's disappointing because It doesn't live up to the old Fallout Titles, because of the changes the game received but because of the lack of content.\nYes the game has ridiculous amounts of things to do, It has immense replay value and if you're like me, you tried your best to avoid using Fast Travel as much as possible and spend most of the time exploring things.\n\nBut me personally, I was disappointed with the lack of quests available and how the game approached them.\n\nOne of the first things that are preventing me from truly recommending this game, is it's disappointing release.\nThe game is flooded with Bugs, Issues, Glitches that it's absolutely ridiculous. I've been relying on the game's Console and Modding community to help me through the game because I suffered from so much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on my play through that I nearly frustrated me to the point I just didn't wanna play the game anymore.\nThat and also the fact that the game is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ PC port with ridiculous Framerate issues, Freezes, long loading screens I had never had to rely on the Modding community so much like I did for this game and this was all so I could get fixes for my game's bugs, stupid inconveniences and all my Framerate Issues.\nThe Lag I got in this game was not due to my computer, I have a damn good computer. It was due to the game being poorly optimized and this is unacceptable.\nThe latest Beta Patch actually helped my Framerate and Turning off the Game's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ Vsync helped smooth out my Framerate as-well.\nBut for some stupid reason Bethesda thought it was a good idea to make your game's speed tied to your Framerate so if you have an FPS above 60 your game is basically going to go on a sugar rush and act all spastic.\nI had to rely on external software to Cap my Framerate to 60.\n\nAnother thing that disappointed me about this game, is the lack of quests.\nAccording to the Fallout 4 Wiki the game in itself on contains 135 quests.\n\nMost of them are Faction Quests.\nThe game has 4 Factions which you can choose from.\n\n-The Brotherhood of Steel\n-The Minuteman\n-The Railroad\n-The Institute\n\nAs you progress through the story, you will unenviably come across some of these quests depending on which faction you join, each faction is basically holding about 1/6 of the game's content.\nDepending on which faction you join, you will have to destroy other factions towards the game's progression which means you will lose that part of the game's total quests!\n\nThis is a very stupid approach and I believe the reason for this is so Players will be encouraged to buy the Season Pass in order to gain more content as the base game lacks quite a bit compared to other Bethesda Titles.\nSkyrim which got released 4 years ago had more content in the base game and had 3 DLC's released throughout the years which added a few more quests.\n\nAfter finishing the main quests and siding with the Brotherhood Of Steel, I ran out of things to do. I was tempted to try and clear out every location I could, but I had no incentive to do so as there were no quests towards that area. In Skyrim, Fallout 3 & New Vegas I always had my quest log flooded with Misc quests and Side quests in which I could hardly even choose what to do first even after I finished the game there was a ridiculous numerous amounts of quests for me to choose from, In Fallout 4 I struggle to find any quests after I even complete the main.\nYes I'm aware the game will most likely have a lot more content and things to do after the Season Pass gets released, but that's stupid logic because there should be more content in the base game instead of being saved up behind a paywall that will come later next year.\nWe will most likely also get custom quests from the Modding Community, but that's only going to come later since we don't have proper Modding tools yet, what we have currently is limited and I have a feeling Bethesda is only going to release it after the Season pass is over and done with so Players will have a reason to buy the Season Pass if they want more content.\n\nMaybe I'm judging Bethesda a little too much, but considering how money hungry many companies have become nowadays, It's a little bit difficult to tell who's going to make a difference. God forbid I am wrong and Modding  get released early next year as mentioned.\n\nBut I think I've ♥♥♥♥♥ed about the game enough as it is.\n\nTime or the good stuff.\nThe game is great, I am having a lot of fun playing it, removing the whole quest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t and the bugs the game is fantastic.\n\nIt has great replayability, plenty of reasons why you should make a new character and start playing the game from the start.\n\nThe game has a great character creation system, WE ARE FINALLY MOVING AWAY FROM SLIDERS!\nHowever I wish sliders were an Optional feature so we could have tutorials on how to create specific/Iconic characters which is fairly difficult to do so with the new system, but nevertheless It's amazing and I'm so glad we're slowly moving away from Sliders.\n\nI enjoy the game's new perk system, however I must say I am not very fond of the fact that now you can Add points to your S.P.E.C.I.A.L  because now you can max out all S.P.E.C.I.A.L  attributes, I think the perk system should've stayed true to the other Fallout games and you'd unlock extra perks depending on your level, but it's still a great new system.\n\nThe game's graphics are improved a lot of people say they're up to scratch and I agree to a certain degree, there are so disappointing textures in the game, but the game still looks fabulous and looks a lot more alive compared to other games of the series.\n\nThe Companions actually feel like real people, they have personalities now, I can actually grow attached to these Companions because they are just fantastic, I enjoy hearing what they have to say and how they interact with the world and the people around it.\n\nThe new Settlement construction is awesome, I love it, I can actually let me creativity flows and build the crazy shelters I wish I could've built in other games, My one complaint is that, It can be really finicky at times and downright aggravating but when it works, It works damn well.\n\nNeedless to say. The game is Fantastic I r8 8/8 while I masturb8 and finger my prost8. Jokes Aside.\n\nI love it, I don't recommend it in the current state though, I'd say wait a few months before purchasing it so the patches get down and the game starts running smoothly and how it should. I'd have to be the poor player who ends up getting a bugged save file and has to restart from scratch, It happened to me once and It has happened to a good friend of mine more than once to the point he nearly quit the game for good.\n\nFallout 4 Is a great game but needs patching for it's current state and Improvements to It's port, It could also use Plenty of additional content as I feel it can be lacking after you've completed the story.\n\nFor those who do have the game already, I hope you are enjoying it.\nThank you for reading.","November 30, 2015","false","282.4"," 53 of 92 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","53","92","0","0"

Another great series thrown straight into the trash. GG, Bethesda! You successfully dumbed-down an already simplistic system, removed countless of Fallout-defining features, made the most messy storyline I've ever seen and you've created a bloody flame war between the old fans and the new fans.\n\nYou know; I thought that game developers were supposed to improve upon existing titles, by making them better while still managing to maintain the game's core fidelity; not depriving them of their features.\n\nGot to give 'em an applause for the amazing game-world they created and the very interesting characters they built, but other than that.... The vibe's gone. Fallout is now an extremely simplified minimalistic shooter with RPG elements set in the Fallout universe.\n\nReminder: Obsidian created Fallout: New Vegas in the course of one year, and that game is seen as maybe the best Fallout game ever created, not the spin-off it was intended to be but actually ended up being the "true successor" of Fallout 2. Now take a look at Fallout 4, a game five years in development, and is seen as the most disappointing Fallout game - the weakest Fallout game - ever released. Sure, it has its moments, but ya got to dig deep to experience them.

The writing is not great to say the least, the UI is crap, although there are some good companions. If you are looking for an FPS, there are way better ones out there.

I really wanted this one to be a big hit so I gave it every chance.  I explored all I could, met up with all the factions, ran through all the endings.  At the end of it all I have to say...while this is a good and impressive game, it is not a FALLOUT game.  This had the feeling of bolting a radiated wasteland and the Fallout name onto a Skyrim clone.  There's really no big senses of accomplishment during the game, just an endless grind.  The endings were short, pro forma, and ultimately cheesy as they again tried to bolt on some of the old Fallout nostalgia.\n\nIt just didn't work.  Sorry Bethesda, you lack the "It" factor for these games.  Since I already bought the DLC pack I'll probably poke around in there briefly to see if you can bring any closure to the affair (ala Bioware with the ending to ME3 mostly coming in DLC).  But even in that, I suppose I'm still old-fashioned enough to expect a good ending in a game WITHOUT having to shell out extra caps for it.","January 31","false","324.8"," 17 of 25 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","17","25","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/377160/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Fallout 4 is the fifth major instalment to the Fallout series, being released on November 10th 2015 for PC, PS4 and Xbox One. The game was developed and published by Bethesda.\n\nIf you didn’t know already, Fallout is set in a post-apocalyptic world, this instalment is set in Boston in the year 2287, hundreds of years after a nuclear war. Game play in Fallout 4 is similar to that of Fallout New Vegas. You can either play the game in first person mode, or third person. Personally I found the first person view to be the best but people will want to experiment for their own liking. This game brings a few new game play elements such as a crafting system, customizable weapons and base building. I really enjoyed the customizable weapons as it was always something I craved for in New Vegas. However I wasn’t a massive fan of the base building; for me this aspect was a little dull and uninteresting; building the base seemed pointless as it very rarely did anything of any real use apart from making more resources. You make the base using a crafting system which incorporates every piece of “material” loot you can find, so everything will have some sort of use. You base will attract settlers in which you can assign them tasks, such as farming or taking control of artillery for example.\n\nAlong with the new game play features, all of the classic elements make a return. The use of Pip-Boy will aid you in the combat situations, letting you select a specific part on your target to shoot. How accurate you are in this mode will depend on your base stats though. Fallout 4 is another really expansive open world that allows you to explore to hearts content, everywhere is accessible (apart from locked doors etc.) from when you start the game, meaning you can do anything you want right from the word go.  The game has four factions in which you can work for and raise your reputation with; but of course, working for one will mean consequences with the other, so you have to pick wisely. Normally I am not a fan of a decision  you make in a game means you miss out on content, but with this one I didn’t mind so much, given that the way the story changes and the quest lines adapt to whatever you chose.\n\nThe graphics in Fallout 4, whilst they are good, they did seem to fall a little bit short of what I was expecting. Mods in the previous two instalments in the franchise are still better looking than this game. That doesn’t mean the graphics are bad, no no. They are definitely on the upper scale of the market out there right now, I was maybe a little overhyped with what to expect, but due to being based on the PC, mods will surely be released which will make this game absolutely gorgeous, and will no doubt make it photo realistic! The game is also fully voice acted to a very high quality, the only issue I had with the voice acting side of things, was that when you are selecting what to say in a dialog option, what you choose can sometimes come out in a different way, and I would of actually liked to have seen the actual words you will speak show on screen rather than a summary of the words.\n\nI was completely immersed in the story of Fallout 4, I was hooked right from the first key point in the game, and you are essentially on a search to find your son who was kidnapped. The main story is only one of the plot lines you can follow in the game, not only do you have the four factions that you can do missions for, you also have plenty of other smaller side quests which also add their own flavour and interesting side plot to the world you are in. The game has some brilliant individual storylines and a lot of them I will remember for a long time.\n\nThe difficulty in Fallout can depend on a couple of things, first of all the game has a good number of difficulty settings that you can change on the fly, meaning if you find a certain part of the game hard, you can drop the difficulty level down to a more manageable level, however I was playing on the medium setting, and I found the challenge to be just right for me. On top of the regular settings, how you play your character will also vary the difficulty of the game, if you opt for a more peaceful run, you may want to be more stealthy and avoid as much combat as you can, where as you can also choose to be all guns blazing and cause as much havoc as possible.\n\nI finished the main story and the majority of side quests in the game; I completed it in just over twenty hours. After finishing the main story you are still free to continue you work in the Commonwealth, allowing you to mop up missions, continue crafting, and levelling up. There is a season pass available for the game meaning there is going to be DLC in the coming months, and not to mention the modability of the game will also mean an almost endless supply of content for you to play. This is going to be another game that you will easily be able to get at least 200 hours out of. The game also has a very high replay ability factor. Whether it is playing your character in a different way, giving yourself different stats for a different play style, or maybe even choosing a different faction to favour towards the end of the game, the possibilities of different endings to the game will be more than enough of a reason to play it through at least one more time.\n\nTechnically, I didn’t have any issues playing Fallout 4. Which is a nice surprise given the issues that New Vegas had on launch. The game comes with fully customizable controls and the option to play on a controller if you choose.  There is also a substantial amount of graphical options meaning you can optimize it for your rig.\n\nTo round up, Fallout 4 is going to be considered as a must play title, and is definitely going to be one of the top games of the year. The game does almost everything right and keeps the gameplay true to its core. The freedom and creativity you can have in the game just make it an almost perfect game that I cannot find very much wrong with. Not to mention the mod support will make this one of the biggest games on the PC platform for the next few years.  The game’s full price of £39, 99 could be considered high for PC, but I would honestly say it is worth every penny of that. But we all know how low Fallout games can go in sales, so if you can wait a few months, you may be able to get this for less than £15 if you are lucky, but please don’t let it stop you from picking the game up now and enjoying this masterpiece of a game.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

Then the following game came, fallout 2.\nEqual in style and ever more impressive it was not just bigger and better, but it had the story of the previously game molded into it, feeling brand new, but also familiar.\n\nThen the fallout 3 came. The rules changed, everything was improved. 3d who would had imagined the game surviving to this point. And the game went into the book of ledgends as the ultimate post-apocalyptic game.\n\nWe old and new loved this change not only because they added the new and improved, but they kept the story and the core basic systems.\n\n-The SPECIAL stats continually add bonuses to skills.\n-Skills represent a character's chance of successfully performing a group of specific tasks (such as firing a gun, or picking a lock)\n-The player also selects three Tag Skills.\n-The PERK`S is determined by the players (skills %) at certaint lvl`s.\n-And the never altered the fallout lore, rules or story.\n\nBut back to fallout 4.\nMany things can be said about it, but is has some positivity to it.\n\n+Good graphic\n\nBut sadly this is all i can say honestly to be positive.\n\non the other side.\n\n-Perks, special`s and skills in general is made in a ridiculous way.\n-Altering the lore of the power armor to use (fuel cells). As  previously game did not have this, and it is not combat efficient at all. (The Brotherhood dissprove of this fuel cell)\n-Placing wath appears to be skyrim developers to make a fallout game (conclusion came when legendary gear and bosses appeared on screen)\n-Make the map smaller at the cost of graphic`s\n-Made it more 1person shooter than an actual RPG-game.\n\nFollowing is grind based, and unnecessary. And only used to make the game feel longer. As previously games has relied on (bottle caps and random scavaging + quest rewards)\n-Getting resources to build your village(es).\n-Getting resources to uppgrade your armor.\n-Getting resources to uppgrade your weapons (since skills no longer exist to boost dammage)\n-Getting resources to make medical supplies.\n\nDo not think i wrote this lightly.

I do NOT play Fallout so I can be in the Walking Dead. However, that appears to be what this game is.\n\nWalk into a ruined town, get mobbed by 20 feral ghouls. See a cabin, approach slowly. Get mobbed by 5 feral ghouls. Walk into a railroad station, get mobbed by 10 feral ghouls. Walk into a building, guess what! Feral ghouls.\n\nAnd when I saw mobbed, I mean it. These are "running zombie" fast. Hell, more like "teleport zombie" fast. They arent so bad if theres a few, but its a giant pain when you've got 20 zipping at you.\n\nI'm sick of f'n feral ghouls. They are EVERYWHERE in this game. I like the new creepy feral ghoul models, but I guess Beth REALLY liked the new feral ghoul model because they stuck feral ghouls all over the f'n place. Hell, I open up a toolbox, it wouldnt surprise me one bit if a feral ghoul popped out.\n\nThere really isnt much else. No sense of a cohesive rebuilding society on the brink of war that you got in New Vegas.\nSo far its just emptyness, abandoned buildings, and feral ghouls all over the f'n place...with the random raider group/base or wasteland monster to round things out.\n\nI was hoping with New Vegas, (the only one of the new games whos story setting and writing felt like "real" Fallout) Beth finally understood what made the Fallout series great...but I guess not.\n\nI can give you a hint though, it WASN'T feral ghouls.\n\nFeral ghouls.","February 7","false","44.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","9"

I love Fallout. 3 and New Vegas are up there amongst my favorite titles of all time. Up there with the original Deus Ex, Final Fantasy, The Elder Scrools, and  Ocarina of Time. The Fallout universe was my first experience with an open world RPG. It was harsh and unforgiving, but once I got the hang of it, the world was an amazing place to explore. it was all about choosing wisely, resource management, and exploration.\n\nI feel like if Fallout 4 was some other game or franchise, I wouldn't be giving it a negative review. It's not "terrible". It's just a terrible Fallout game. The immersion of the character just is not there for me. I do not feel like I am the character, like I have in past installments. It feels like it's on rails, and I'm just along for the ride. That's something I have come to expect from other titles, but not from Fallout. The dialog system is just plain awful, and the voiced protagonist is the worst. They should have focused their efforts elsewhere. Kudos for trying something new I suppose, but it most definitely did not work out unfortunately.\n\nWhile on the subject of trying new things: settlement building. I was thoroughly unimpressed with this as well. It's one of those things, that I may have gotten into, or cared about, if the rest of the game was playable for me. I feel like they spent too much time with this kind of stuff, and forgot to make a memoralbe RPG around it. If I wanted to build civilizations, I would go play Civilization. This is not what Fallout is about. If they had fit this aspect into a decent Fallout game then OK, but as it stands, that is not the case.","April 10","false","59.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

You can ask a person 1-2 question about a quest, say "Yes", "No", "Maybe" or "Yes Sarcasticly" and ask a single question about quest itself. This is it!\nThere are very few phrases that NPCs say to each other. Missions are mostly kill and retrieve.\nPlot has many holes and world in general is hard to believe in. It is supposed to be 200 years after the war and nothing has changed. People still have plenty of pre-war trash to survive, there are no factories, farmers use literally bare hands to tend crops. And even in stone age cavemen were more creative.\n\nWorld is small - "capital town" has a size of Megaton, smaller settlements have about two nameless NPCs going about and a single shack. And even these small camps can "feed" ruined factories populated with thirty to twenty raider who would raid them now and then.\nBuildings also shrunk significantly - Supermarket for example is several times smaller compared to Fallout 3.\n\nThere are actually less enemies\n\nBase building is shallow - there is no point in elaborate construction. As long as numbers of food and water are more then population and the nuber of turrets is high enough it is fine. Economy model is flawed - purified water made in exsess is the best source of income.\nShops in bases give no resonable return on investment and at least as level 2 shop goes, do not even allow selling loot withing base. Hard to argue though, as you assign one of the settlers to this lemon stand and can barter with anyone for any item.\nWhile residents of bases can pick up weapons from enemies and use them they will not use armor.\n\nMinor bugs - it is possible to stick under a terminal after hacking it, supply lines may stop functioning.\n\nKey mapping is not suitable for left-handed people (does not bother me, but can be a huge issue for others).\n\nBottom line.\nWeapon customization can carry game only for a time beeing. As levels grow progress in modding department comes to a halt. Without RPG component it is a mediocre shooter, thus time is better spent elsewhere.\nSeason pass is out of the question.\n\nP.S.

The customization is amazing, and I'll admit with some mods that just gets a hell of a lot better by making some suits, like the tuxido and hazmat suit, able to be worn with armor, OP? it's situational but really after playing a few days of this game you get like that anyways...but...\n\nIt doesn't feel like a fallout game, it really doesnt. The story is so lackluster compared to the previous fallouts (Yes, from the very first to new vegas including the spinoffs) it feels more like a fast paced shooter with the element of exploration. Unless you've been living under a rock you know that fallout 4, despite the creatiors knowing that the skills were part of the game that the fans loved, completely forgone the skill part of the game and instead pretty much made most of it perk based. I mean don't get me wrong, I like some perks, but what I don't like is enimies getting a LOT stronger and spongy when I put my points into armor and gun smithing only to have said guns pretty much be as useful as tossing a pebble at them. I liked New vegas and LOVED fallout 3 for having the feeling of progression as they had it, where you not only gained a perk but also you got better at sneaking, killing, batering, or even surviving in the wastes. Fallout 4 feels more like you're getting better with some, but not all depending on what you do. Granted yes, if you took the time, you could actually gain levels through just building but, while the building is nice, it's boring to go scearching through ruins to find a clipboard or clock or desk fan to find that last peice you need.\n\nAlso, while this may seem unorthadox for someone to complain about but...when the newer fallouts came out they were buggy, and are even buggy to this day. Perhaps yes it's weird to say fallout 4 kinda made me feel like it wasn't a fallout game cause I didn't encounter any silly glitches but...yeah.\n\nI remember the first time I saw a deathclaw in Fallout 3, I seriously almost ♥♥♥♥ myself till it suddenly decided to not fight me and took off into the sky at mach speeds. It took three days, just me going around after forgetting about the flying deathclaw till I suddenly saw a dark speck in the air, falling at alarming speeds till suddenly I had this large lizard suddenly fall over onto the ground then bounce once before dying. I remember another time where another one in the DC ruins decided to say hello to me when I exited the state building by suddenly popping up onto the roof and, while I was trying to figure out where it went, pop right onto a fence nearby. Not only deathclaws did this though, as some supermutiants probably decided to cease hostilities with the brotherhood as they both just stood around, neither firing another shot till, admittingly, I stole a tedy bear which caused both to suddenly decide that I was the evil one there. Needless to say I didn't last long under such heavy fire, even with my T45-B.\n\nIn New Vegas? Oh where to begin. Cazadores flying through the ground? Giant ants crawling sideways across the ground? Raiders-excuse me, fiends- suddenly dying with no other reason besides a heart attack from overuse of chems? The bugs were plentyful and never once did I have a day where I didn't enjoy a ragdoll from a missle launch and never once did I miss a shot where my target was a dot on my screen. New Vegas ans Fallout 3 both have special places in my heart cause of the stories and bugs they came with...\n\nThe only few bugs I've ever encountered was when it was annoying, like a legendary deathclaw falling through the ground or a bugged quest that required me to know the next step to get it going. Fallout 4 is kinda like Bioshock infinite to me, an absolutely amazing game that just falls short from actually feeling like a game that it's named after...\n\nThe short of it is, while this game is amazing, I can't reccomend this title cause it feels like the makers of this game spent seven years of swapping out things fallout fans loved with pretty awesome stuff, which isn't a good thing if you're a fan. I'd personally suggest buying Fallout: New Vegas or Fallout 3 for console or if you have a vista computer or just skip all that for the (slightly buggy) Tales of Two Wastelands mod if you want a fallout experience that most fans know of, or even splurge and pick up the origional 2d fallout games.\n\nEdit for the Automatron DLC:\nOK, I will admit that it is getting closer to the entire reccomended side of the post but only cause of this DLC. I started up my old character I've guiltily been playing every hour since Fallout 4 came out only to find that ALL my mods pretty much made the entire game buggy. Agian, not the fun type of bugs but where it went from playable to completely dead. So after clearing all my mods and putting back on some that change weapons a bit? I started off with a new character.\n\nFast forward a day and quite a few levels, along with picking up the Silver Shroud outfit mostly cause I thought of how the Mechanist was one of the evildoers from the Silver Shroud radio, and there I am gunning down the first few robots...and more robots...and more robots and people dressed like robots...and a factory worth of robots. All too soon was this DLC finished for me, then I got to the meat of it which was building your own robots. Now this, THIS I can agree is amazing cause if you build your bots right they can actually go out and FARM. THEY ACT LIKE SETTLERS WITH THE RIGHT BUILD! I cannot tell you how annoying it is to have to wait for one settler to show up only to have him go off to my hub of either sanctuary/the castle/starlight drive in then have to wait LONGER for another to show up so I can actually start a farm, with the Automatron DLC I'm just able to build a sentry or something in one town, move them to another then make them a Supplier back to the hub town. Granted, they're expensive to build so it's not all fun but it's pretty awesome to just be able to build your population and not have to worry too much about building the things settlers need. Also not to mention the Robots are much, MUCH more robust than settlers and seem to be able to defend themselves rather well (doesn't mean you can skimp on the defences of your settlements or just leave them to defend themselves but eh.)\n\nHonestly with how short the story of this DLC, and how I could breeze through it with just one death when I thought a robot wouldn't explode in my face, I can't reccomend it on story alone but I CAN reccomend it for what it does to Fallout 4 itself.","January 29","false","262.5"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","18","27","2","0"

This is an opinionated, biased or whateve review, but enough of that.  So far I have been enjoying Fallout 4 as I did with the previous games Bethesda has made. Some more than others and while I do think it is good it isn't exactly perfect as no games are without their flaws.\n\nPositive: I believe that Bethesda made the enviorment of the game good. In the aspect of some places creepy and some interactions funny. I have been immersed with the game for a while, exploring the wastes of nuclear fallout. The game felt like it was giving me a full package unlike some that would supply us with DLCs to keep us interested in the game, I was constantly in to the game I was playing. FO4 was constantly supplying me with entertainment and there weren't many dull moments. While I do enjoy the game, like I said earlier the game isn't in my opinion perfect or great. I can only describe it as a "Bethesda Game". Each one are good with their own merits and their own interestes and enjoyment, I enjoy the RPG aspect of the game and it is what I expected.\n\nNegative: There are some game breaking bugs out there. It detracts from the immersiveness that the game provides. Some may not encounter it and some may, but some makes the game unplayable. An example of this would be the, "Boston After Dark" quest line where I'm sure many people besides me have experienced many crashes. While crashes in a Bethesda game is common, I kept getting constantly crashed and I couldn't complete the quest :\. While I do think that Bethesda would fix this, it made me go from being immersed to now having a stronger obstancle to wait. Another would be the constant side quests from my settlements to "help" them. At first it was interesting, but after saving Sanctuary from an area that's ten or more miles away that they are so afraid they would get invaded even though I put turrets everywhere, the annihilating the Raiders or Ghouls quests have started to make me tired of them after doing it constantly for five times.\n\nFunny: There are many funny bugs and glitches that maybe encountered through your playthrough. For me an interesting glitch was that some feral ghouls would be docile towards me despite being in front of them until I engage them in combat.\n\nIn the end, if you are impatient and couldn't wait like me, I would recommend playing this game. It is what you would expect from a "Bethesda Game" and that is all I can explain about it. Sorry, I am bad at reviews, but Bethesda is one of the few companies I like and uhh.. yeah.. :s Thank you for reading ^^;\n\n8/10 , press "E" to activate skeleton","November 14, 2015","true","273.9"," 186 of 341 people (55%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","55","186","341","15","0"

And I ♥♥♥♥ing regret it.\n\nI'll come in details about why it feels so outdated, boring, bad and downgraded.\nGraphics\nAI\nStory\nModability\nSettlement\nSurvival\nTL;DR at bottom\nThanks for reading\nGraphicsLet's start off with graphics. At first Fallout 4 seems fresh and new, shiny to some good point. Well guess what... That's just sugar coating for the first part of the pre-war, after you exit the vault, it's just mostly bleak, boring and all that maner of crap.\n\nYes... I get it... there's been a nuclear blast, but that's about 210 years ago... at least make the ♥♥♥♥ing wild-life grow. Can't expect everything to be dirt-brown and boring, what is this? Pooptown?\n\nAt least you can retexture that...\n\nAINow let's get to the AI! Not much is to say about the AI... It's not impressive, generic at best, nothing new to offer, just the same old shooty NPCs you can expect... You should also expect the stupid AI from Skyrim with companions standing in the way, so next to no improvement.\n\nStoryGod, this is god ♥♥♥♥ing boring! It's more interesting to do a damn escorting quest! At first it feels like a normal story, a bit normal, but at some point it feels rushed, and makes you confused as to what the ♥♥♥♥ is going. You just talked to this guy speaking about some boring ♥♥♥ shit. Suddenly, an interferance machine! Ya-- wait what? You know what... Skip the ♥♥♥♥ing "story", it's not memorable of something good, only boring and only serves as something that was suddenly there.\n\nOh let me mention... Your character is pre-determined about their past and what they are, so don't expect any of kind RPG.\n\nModabilityFallout 4 + Mods = No-go.\n\nBut you're wrong! It's a bethesda game! It's bound to be moddable!\n\nLet me be clear. Bethesda taken the Mass Effect route, which is a linear game to most extensions, whereas Fallout 4 is a sandbox. Voice Acting + Sandbox + Mod support = NO.\n\nThe voice acting is... okay... but ruins any form of quest-mod, because you would have the voice actors themselves who did the vanilla Fallout 4 to do the voice acting, and is that easy? Hahahaha, I bet you already see this point. But it doesn't stop there.\n\nThe dialogues... Holy ♥♥♥♥. This is a simplified version of Mass Effect's dialogue wheel, it worked for Mass Effect, but that doesn't mean it will work for other games, such as Fallout 4? It's just... No, just no.\n\nSettlementOkay... Okay... And okay... Why is this thing in a 1st/3rd person shooting game? Why shall players take their time to build a crappy version of the Sims? Why is it even in this game? Did they even think of why?!\n\nI don't have the ♥♥♥♥ing time to spend 1 hour just to build some damn settlement for NPCs that can't take care of themselves! What is this?! Kintergarden?! They keep calling for assistance when they got 20 ♥♥♥♥ing guard turrets, and gets wrecked by ♥♥♥♥ing attack dogs or worse!\n\nAt this ♥♥♥♥ing point, it's just a damn "Burden-game", where you, the player, has to take care of every ♥♥♥♥ing thing just to keep every one else fine, meanwhile you work your ♥♥♥ off.\n\nSurvivalLol. This survival... just a laugh-off if you ask me.\n\nAll these kinds of diseases... Just from 1 jump into the water... with Power Armor... Where my feet touches the water... And already I got Lethargy.\n\nWhat. The. ♥♥♥♥. Is this! Why do I get Lethargy on first contact with water? With Power Armor even! This is completely illogical and just a burden once again!\n\nAnd don't tell me survival is hard, it's just the player dealing 50% lower damage, and NPCs dealing twice more damage, with no change to AI, no fast-traval, disabled Console Command (because ♥♥♥♥ you if you get stuck), carry weight reduced by 50% (once again, ♥♥♥♥ you player).\n\nWhy can't Bethesda just ♥♥♥♥ing learn from Obsidian Entertainment on: How To RPG Properly. Is it this hard? Is it because your Fallout 3 wasn't successful as Fallout: New Vegas? Also to mention that their RPG and survival is better than Fallout 4? Also to even strict Obsidian Entertainments development to 18 months. Yes one and a half year to make a game, and thus they had almost no time to bug-fix and release, thank you, Besthesda, for being ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nNot gonna rewrite my review on this game, cause it's the 4th time, oh just to mention... the DLCs suck balls, nothing interesting (Automatron (Crashes like ♥♥♥♥ by the way, and no solution) and Wasteland Workshop).\n\nTL;DRNo time to read? Fallout 4 is a failure if you ask me, simplified, bad mod support, bad survival (just stressing players for who knows why), bad DLCs (Automatron (not to mention, crash-fest) & Wasteland Workshop, and thus bad expectations of Far Harbor), terrible RPG, oh look another boring-♥♥♥ shooter game.\n\nThanks for readingAnd to end it all off, thank you, random stranger, for reading my review, and... have a good day or night!\n\nEdit: Spellcheck and correction.","May 15","false","121.0"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","11","14","3","2"

I don't recommend this as a Fallout game. And since it's marketed as one, I say no. I spent 230+ hours on it, I enjoy it, but as a completely different game. It is not Fallout, and here's why:\n- Conversations\nIn previous Fallout games, you had much, much more dialouge options than in this installment. 4 options in each situation. I understand that the voice actors had a lot to record as it is, but I would have taken a silent protagonist with more choices. I had no problems with the shortened versions, although I prefer seeing all. But what is unforgivable, is that ALL DIALOUGES ARE THE SAME\nYes, I am a kind person\nYes, but ♥♥♥♥ you\nYes but I want money\nYes sarcastically\n- Character creation (I will use NV as an example because I enjoyed that more than FO 3)\nYou assign your SPECIAL, you make the face, aaaand..... That's it. No skill points, nothing, just a perk each level. Thus, the use of your skills in conversations are absent here, and that is a huge letdown. I loved New Vegas's system, how you could use your strength, barter, speech, or just sneak skill to get out of a sticky situation. None of that here. In New Vegas, I felt like I was really in control over my character, in every way. Here, it feels like a COD with a skill tree, plus the usual perks, like lockpicking, hacking, Mysterious Starnger, etc.\n- Karma and ways of playing\nWhen I discovered that my only options to be evil is to kill all that I can, I was bummed. In the previous installments, you could pull off some of the most evil, twisted ♥♥♥♥ I ever saw. Here, the most evil thing I found is *SIDE QUEST SPOILER* To sell the kid from the fridge to a random dude. *SPOILER OVER* You are always the good guy, even if you do something against someone, there is someone backing you up, justifying what you did.\n-World\nNow, don't get me wrong, it is a huge world with a lot to see... but you see it all pretty quickly. It feels empty after my first playthrough. Unlike Skyrim (Which I have 700 hours in all things considered,) I don't bump into new stuff in every new playthrough.\nA bit about Bethesda\nYes, we were all joking about how it's buggy, and screws up your save. But when after a week of playing, enduring a bugfest, wanting to start the game on a lazy morning... Corrupt save file, Not so funny then, huh? We shouldn't allow this to happen. WE BUY THESE PRODUCTS. We make the demand, and we didn't want a buggy game, did we? So think about this when you are playing.\n\nAll in all, I will continue to play this game, all DLCs, and see if it can turn me around. This is a good game, but not a good Fallout.\n\nSorry for the long text, here's a potato\n\nPotato","May 20","false","239.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

At the time of writing this I'm on my 5th character with almost 200 hours logged on Steam. However, I'll be the first to admit that my love for this game is likely more of a relief that a new Fallout game was released with more up-to-date graphics and features after so many years than that it was a well-made game. While Fallout 4 takes plenty of steps in the right direction, there are a lot of things that need to be addressed. My cons may seem overwhelmingly greater than the pros, but that's mostly because a lot of the problems are little things that require specific changes, while most of the good things are very broad and can be explained with very few words. With that being said, let's get on to the details, starting with the good news.\n\nPros\n- The game looks and sounds great. A massive improvement since the last installments.\n- Weapon modding allows you to make whatever kind of gun you want. Many weapons can be modified to suit close, mid, or long range playstyles.\n- Lots of lovable followers, each with their own likes and dislikes, and helpful perks once they reach maximum affinity. Their commentary makes the wasteland feel a little less lonely.\n- Plenty of areas to explore, many with their own stories in the form of notes and terminal entries, much like the previous games.\n- The voice acting has improved in almost all cases. Characters tend to sound more lively.\n- Quick-loot menu means no more waiting for the animation of a cabinet opening every time you want to find out what's inside.\n- Sentry Bots look (and are) much more bad-♥♥♥.\n- The mod scene is, at this point, already booming. And the G.E.C.K. only JUST came out.\n\nCons\n- The UI is the absolute worst. It was obviously made explicitly for consoles, then repurposed for PC. Keys are simply remapped straight from controller bindings, seemingly without a second thought about practicality.\n- Dialog tree is narrow or non-existent. All conversations consist of 4 choices; typically Yes, No, Maybe, and a question that can be asked before a decision is made.\n- The game railroads you pretty hard. There aren't a lot of choices you get to make that change the outcome of a quest short of just shooting people, and occasionally you'll even find that choosing the "mean" dialog option results in the same exact response from the NPC as if you had chosen the "nice" one, even if it doesn't entirely make sense.\n- Speech checks are percentages again, so you can just save-scum instead of keeping Charisma-boosting items around.\n- No more skill checks, because there are no more skills. The game now relies exclusively on SPECIAL and perks, but this also means that some SPECIAL-altering items are worthless. For example, increasing your Perception will just give a negligible boost to VATS accuracy for a short time, and is never worth it.\n- Character background is very specific and leaves little room for roleplaying. The story is very clear about who you were and are as well as what you need to do. You can pretend you're someone else for awhile, but the main quest will be quick to remind you that you're just a desperate (or angry, depending on which of the two dialog choices you pick) parent.\n- One of the characters inexplicably knows about Dogmeat, even if they never see him with you.\n- The hundreds of player names that were recorded are only used very seldomly by a single companion and doesn't flow well with the dialog.\n- NPCs have mediocre facial and body animations. The game tries to wow you with some frankly incredible animations when you first reach Diamond City, then never uses anything like them again in favor of about a dozen other less interesting ones over and over. NPCs still need to stand still while changing direction.\n- Settlement building is very clunky. Terrain is almost never flat but the building mechanic seems to have been designed as if it always is.\n- No more weapon repairing. Could be a pro or con, but I personally dislike this because there's no point in picking up spare weapons anymore except for selling, and you'll never be hurting for caps.\n- The ending leaves a lot to be desired. Not much changes other than that you get rid of the factions working against the one you side with and some repeatable quests become available, which there aren't any shortage of anyway. This was likely required in order to let you keep playing after finishing the main quest, but it results in a very dampened feeling of accomplishment.\n- An almost sickening amount of repeatable quests. Some make sense, but others have you doing something that you just did 1-2 in-game days ago. In some cases, turning in one of them immediately starts another, making it very difficult to keep a clean quest log.\n- Optimization issues cause instabilities that either result in crashes or stuttering.\n\nSo that's it. Do I like the game? Very much so. Would I recommend purchasing it right now? Probably not.\n\nI probably would have waited too if I hadn't been desperate for a new Fallout game to explore. Perhaps that was an intentional business tactic that I fell hook line and sinker for, but I digress. I'm sure the modders will be fixing a lot of these issues down the road, but that time is still pretty far off. If you can manage it, hold off on Fallout 4 for now, wait until the price goes down a little and a lot of the "mistakes" get reverted by the modding community. You'll be saving yourself some money and disappointment. The G.E.C.K. was just released as well as the beginning of the Unofficial Fallout 4 Patch, so things are already getting better. Modders are already on their way to fix the mess Bethesda has made, again.","April 30","false","208.8"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

Certain areas of the map are literally unplayable, causing a crash to desktop with 100% consistent reproducability. This has now been a well publicized problem that the newest patches were supposed to address. They apparently do not address this, as my game continues to crash in those areas. I've followed all of the recommendations on the Bethesda website, reset my .ini files, updated my drivers, I'm running an i7 with a Titan X and plenty of ram. Hardware is not an issue.\n\nI have tried to contact Bethesda via email on two separate occasions over the last three weeks. They have not yet responded to me.

The setting is fantastic, the improvement in graphics was so much I had to get a new video card for the first time in over 3 years AND Bethesda didn't blow it's voice acting budget by hiring a great A-lister and then filling in the rest.  THIS ALONE WOULD NORMALLY SCORE A RECOMMENDATION.\n\nNow for the bad, and for me this is deal-breaking stuff.  The settlement creation system is just absolutely terrible:  Snapping things into place is just an exercise in frustration and fixing the walls at the Castle is perhaps the worst set of feels I've experienced in a game since listening to a companion spring a trap in Skyrim and knowing I'm about to get my corpse punted down a hallway by a spiky metal wall-trap.  This feature needs a better interface, maybe a third-person view mode for trickier builds and a snap-grid to make settlement construction feel like a finished product instead of a terrible sequel to Fallout Shelter.\n\nMoving on, making companions essential is an immersion breaker, especially when a companion turns on me during a quest because things went south fast and it becomes absolutely impossible to do anything but run away because the companion just springs right back up to their feet and tries to kill me.  Sometimes ol' yeller needs to be put down.  This feels like a stopgap measure in place of an AI rework to prevent companions from doing the extraordinarily stupid things they did in Fallout 3 to get themselves killed in combat, but instead of eventually fixing the problem they decided to release anyway.\n\nIn summary, I paid AAA game prices for what should've been listed on the Early Access page.  It's a great concept but the execution is sloppy and I will under no circumstances recommend this game to anyone until significant overhauls are performed, either by the developers or the modding community.","December 17, 2015","false","138.7"," 42 of 72 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","42","72","3","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaptorLover/recommended/377160/","RaptorLover","Lizard King","http://steamcommunity.com/id/RaptorLover/","260 products in account","TL;DR version: Vanilla game at full price: Not recommended. If you can get it cheap, are prepared to spend time modding it, ignore the awful quests and dialogue, and there aren't any other games you want to get: Yeah go for it I guess.\n\nThis is less a Fallout game, and more akin to a Fallout-based Mass Effect mod. Almost everything that made the Fallout series what it is has been ripped out of this. Your character is pre-determined in everthing but looks, the quests all boil down to "kill everything and maybe pick up something at the end" with no other ways to complete them, skills and their associated skill-checks are gone, nothing you do seems to have any real consequence, the dialogue - and choices presented - are consistently awful, the pacing is screwed, companions are frequently beyond useless, the multiple storyboard endings are scrapped in favour of just 2 endings, the UI is a joke, and more.\n\nIn additon, Bethesda's usual bugs - some of them game-breaking - are present once again. I had to abandon my first game 20 hours in because arriving at my home base would crash the game, rendering me unable to access all the weapons, armour, ammo, and aid I had stocked there, along with all the crafting benches. I had been out in the wasteland long enough for all 4 of my previous autosaves to have the issue. In my second game, I ended up stuck in a room for 10 minutes because both of the elevators to exit the room were bugged, and multiple attempts to load different saves and restarting the game were needed to progress.\n\nA settlement and crafting minigame has also been shoehorned in, which is by far the most inconsistent and frequently-infuriating parts of the game. Resource scarcity rarely makes sense, and perfectly good sources must be abandoned in favour of breaking down old desk fans or clipboards. Your character can repair power armour, create water purifiers and automated machinegun turrets out of junk, but can't fix the holes in the roof. Getting parts to line up when creating new shelters rarely works how you'd expect.\n\nI did eventually manage to have a bit of fun with this game by adding numerous mods to make it harder, such as fixing the ludicrous amount of loot given out by default (my first character ended up with over 150 stimpacks, thousands of each type of ammunition, over 100 bobby pins, and 30-40 of each drug by level 25), ignoring most of the quests (therefore bypassing the awful diaglogue), and just playing the game as a survival/exploration game, sneaking around trying to kll things before they kill me with my now-limited resources. It's the closest thing I could get to a new S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game. Mods don't merely improve Fallout 4, they're practially a requirement to making it usable.\n\nThere are so many more little niggles and tales of disappointment, but I think I have rambled long enough already. I simply cannot recommend this at full AAA price in its default state, and it certainly has not earned the right to call itself Fallout.","December 17, 2015","false","59.7"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","19","29","0","1"

Ten hours into the game I was already bored, the charm that made the fallout series what it is is gone. Everything now is a go kill such and such, the factions themselves are full of for the most part forgettable characters, and I can't play the game I really want to.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apfelsator/recommended/377160/","Apfelsator","Joshua Norton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Apfelsator/","59 products in account","As a fan of the series since Fallout 1, i can't recommend this game to any other person loving Fallout for\n-its vast roleplaying elements\n-good story and dialogs\n-the overwhelming amount of backround lore which goes into even small locations/areas of the world, weapons, armor or items\n-the variety of characters you can build/roleplay\n-the great replayability\n-the variety of factions/groups or NPC characters in general and all of them with a great backround story\n-the lovely designed quests which feel unique and fitting(most of the time)\n-the atmosphere of the world which pulls you in and wont let you go even if you don't play\nbecause Fallout 4 has none of it.\n\nThe promises which Bethesda made to the fanbase of Fallout where great and many of them and this game met almost none of them.\n\nThe dialog choices are horrible, one-dimensional and often enough force you into either choosing the most friendly answer or something totally stupid which no one would say in most moments.\nAnd since there is no Karma-System anymore, the choice you made really doesn't matter at all.\nThere is a joke going around in the Fallout community, regarding the dialog choices:\n-Yes\n-No(Yes)\n-Sarcastic(Yes)\n-Talk(leading to Yes in the end)\nand this is basically what most dialogs with "choices" are.\n\nThe lack of a Karma-System leads to your actions having no meaning at all and also no real impact on the world itself, besides some choices of the main story.\nYou are basically almost always faced with the status quo which you can't change no matter what you do(a great example is Diamond City and its hatred for ghouls).\nAlso, with the lack of a proper Faction-System and/or the interaction between Karma and Faction affiliation, you can happily murder your way through the commonwealth without people reacting to it as long as they are not the ones getting killed.\nNow don't misunderstand me here, what i mean are situations like that i can easily kill the roaming traders of the commonwealth in my settlement and their guards in my settlements and not a single one of my settlers will even question my reasons, hell most of the time they start shooting them as soon as i attack the traders.\n\nLike others have said in reviews about this game, the lack of factions in numbers is another thing, Fallout New Vegas had 32 factions and each and everyone of those factions had some questlines, a proper and deep backstory, believable motivations and characters, even if some of them felt like they where just there for the nostalgia(the great Khans for example).\nIn Fallout 4 you have 4 factions, one of them the minutemen, a militia which is just pops up of nowhere with no real motivation of the group explained other then "lets make the commonwealth a save place to life" and which suddenly grows into an army out of nowhere and no one knows where they get the ressources, people or equipment to mess with the half the commonwealths population....and all that after they designated a walking ice pop from the past to their general and a "second in command" which couldn't even wipe his ♥♥♥ without the help of his general.\n\nThe motivations of the other 3 groups are a bit more believable but still lack a proper explanation, even with the brotherhood being one of them(they are even worse pictured then in Fallout 3, in my opinion).\nAll that while the settlements and civilians of the commonwealth are barely trading with each other(if at all) and mostly just stand for themself, ignoring the world around them completely(there are raider camps a stone's throw away from a lot of these settlements).\n\nThe character/perk system is embarassing at best.\nNot only is there no level-cap anymore, leading to you accumulating enough skill points to max out ALL of the perks(which is utterly ridiculous) and therefor leading to a jack/jill-of-all-trades on EVERY playthrough, reducing the replayability of the game drastically.\nFurthermore, there are no more traits, only perks and none of them have any balancing factor like in the games before.\nSo you don't choose a trait/perk which may give you an advantage, lets say better sight/perception at night but a disadvantage at day, no, every single one of the perks in Fallout 4 only give you an advantage but most of them are pretty boring or uninteresting in themself(the "robotics expert" is a good example after the recent patches, you can "hack" robots if you are close to them, meaning if you can basically touch them).\n\nThe settlement building system was something i personally wished for since fallout 1 but its implementation is lackluster and feels rushed and unfinished and is more of less only properly useable with disabling collisions with an in-game-console command.\nAdditionally, the amount of items you can build in the build-mode is also lacking variety, even with the stupid wasteland workshop DLC(Fallout 4's Horse Armor DLC) and only mods make this a much more enjoyable thing.\n\nWell, i could go on for pages but yeah, the game feels overall dull and empty, more like a technical demonstration of what the engine is able to do(it is still not that good of an engine) but not like a proper fallout at all.\n\nThere are a few good things but the overwhelming amount of bad game decisions just bury those things.\nAn example is how Power Armor is handled now, the basic concept of the PA as some kind of vehicle/one-person-tank holds great potential in my opinion and fits the lore of the Fallout Universe much more.\nThe gunplay is also pretty well done but Fallout never was about the gunplay so yeah.\nThe settlement building is, as i said, a nice idea but is done horribly.\nThere are quite a few areas/locations in the game which would be great for sidequests or nice player interaction but are just plain shooting ranges in game, "Easy City Downs" and "Libertalia" spring into my mind immediatly here, those where some of my most disappointing "discoveries" in-game so far since they hold so much potential and you can see that the level/area-designers put a lot of detail into those locations but well.\nOtherwise, i think the overall graphics are actually quite good.\n\nIn the end, i just hope that Obsidian may find the time again to do another Fallout, while New Vegas was far from perfect, at least it felt like a proper Fallout game where your choices matter on the one side but also you where not the most important person in the wasteland.\n\nThe Mojave(and the lore of the world around it, like the NCR or the lands of the Legion and the lands behind) felt like a proper, breathing world, where a human society tries to rebuild a civilisation but fails(arguably) on humanity itself.\n\nThen there was you the player character, living in this kind of world and trying to make a living.\nHell, even the initial(and further) motivation of the player character was totally believable, not the annoying family drama Fallout 4 or Fallout 3 are.\n\nBesides that, the modding community is great again and makes it possible to make Fallout 4 at least get a bit closer to a proper fallout game.\nBut the community can only do so much.","June 1","false","276.2"," 27 of 44 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","27","44","2","29"

Fallout 4 has decided to take the route of giving you the illusion of making a choice and forces you to complete a task with only the methodology of that task differing, with no meaningful reason behind why you should even bother. Not to mention the fact that the looting system is dumbed down to bits of legendary equipment and weapons with a few different attachment, which compared to previous fallout games is an insult. Like I said it's a great game but a really ♥♥♥♥ fallout game, it's graphics are nicely done with great attention to detail on indvidual parts and displays where you can clearly see a lot of time has put in by the graphicla artists. The gunplay is much better compared to previous fallout games and allows the game to stand out in the FPS or third person shooter genres, without being the games sole defining trait.

I very much enjoyed quite a bit of it. But I seem to always have a hard time talking about what's good about this game. Having no morality is still the big one for me. Paraphasing Yahtzee "with nobody to be dissapointed in me, there's no motivation to be evil." That's just part of it. It feels like they took what made the previous installments so lovable and fun and removed them. I miss having evil karma, or skills, or roleplaying. That's right, it feels like this isn't even a RPG sometimes. It falls somewhere where Borderlands falls, an FTS with RPG elements.  And the shooting isn't even on par with moderen FTSes, it's better than Fallout 3's shoot mechanics, but not by much. There's something going on with the leadership of Bethesda right now, and I'm a loyal fan of their games, but I can't get this bad taste out of my mouth. The last straw was the patch released today, that makes it so mods disable achievements. This is just all kinds of wrong. Mods are a HUGE part of your games, so why would you want to deter me from using them in any way? I've been running through this game more lately because I didn't enjoy iy for long back in November.

(Even without mods)\n\nFallout 4 was really fun and enjoyable for about the first 3 weeks for me, but I soon realised it lacked a bit in the way of improvements from the previous Fallouts. This write up could be huge if I wanted it but I will do my best to keep it simple and to the point. (My opinion)\n\nPros: The game definitely looked a lot better than it's predecessors, the new engine was exactly what the game needed.\nIt runs great on very high for me. (Nvidia GTX 770).\nThe new inventory system is great, you no longer have to bring up a menu to see what's in that desk. Very simple view and quick to take and store items.\nA great size map when you take into account the amount of in door locations, some of them being huge.\n\nCons: Combat is dull, very dull. Unfortunately the AI aren't great at 'wanting' to actually kill you. They spend far to much time shooting near you and hiding behind things.\nThe balance with difficulty is not good. Early on the game is a bit hard on Survival, but as soon as you reach around lv 18 and get some Legendary Gear you can smash anything farely easily. The difficulty as it get's higher basically reduces the percentage of damage you dish out and gives the enemies a higher one. This just causes some enemies to essentially become a big filthy sponge. Causing combat to get a bit lack luster for me.\nThe settlement building 'Option' really steps away from what the Fallout series was. I understand this is only an option for players but I feel as though the creators spent too much time and effort into it rather than the base game.\nThe power armour breaks the game when you use it. You become a fortress even on Survival without upgrading it. But again this is just an 'Optional choice' for players.\nThe Factions are dull. The stories just didn't do it for me, I honestly didn't like a single one of them. I feel as though that with such a big map they didn't put the Factions into as much use as they could have. E.g. There aren't enough patrols going on, it's really only the Brotherhood of Steel that do anything.\nA lot of the higher up perks you get towards the end of the game are ALL to do with VATS. So that was a bit of a bummer, as a person who hardly uses it I would have liked some more interesting ones. I have a mouse.. who needs VATS.\n\nThe future DLC is in 3 parts. Automatron, Wasteland Workshop and Far Harbor. Of the 3 listed only 1 of them actually intrigues me. That would be Far Habor because it is going to be an additional large scale area to explore, missions and new enemies. Automatron seems to be a robot building add-on with a side mission just to make it sound a bit better. Wasteland Workshop is by far the worst of the three, this one is really just additional content for settlements and the ability to catch wild animals and fight them against other ones... as in Pokemon. For me, Automatron and Wasteland Workshop sound terrible and move away from what the past expansions have been for the Fallout series.\n\nIt may sound stupid but the Settlement 'option' in this game really has ruined a lot of it for me. They have dedicated an entire DLC pack just for it rather than creating another explorable area with missions, enemies and weapons. I do look forward to playing this game again with the Survival difficulty overhaul they are making, but I am not holding my breath. I really think this game was a massive let down for such a big Fallout fan and because of this I cannot recommend this game.","February 6","false","109.3"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

They are experimenting with dangerous FPS elements, that could prove to be Fallout's undoing for the second time- in recent history. The Bethesda developers have created a weapon that transcends the destructive nature of Black Isle's bankruptcy, they call their creation; "Fallout 4" an abomination of technology that is repeptitive and masquerades as a Fallout game, this... notion, that Fallout 4 could be granted Fallout licensing is not only offensive, but horribly dangerous. And like bankruptcy, it has the potential to render Fallout extinct as an RPG. I- am not prepared to allow Bethesda to continue this line of experimentation. Therefore, Bethesda and their Fallout 4 are considered enemies of the Brotherhood of Obsidian. And should be reviewed negatively, and mercilessly. This campaign will not be costly, and many dollars will be unspent. But in the end, we will be saving Bethesda from it's worst enemy...

Your choices no longer feel like they make a difference in the game and the endings are lackluster at best. When I finished it the first time I wasn't sure that it was even over because there was no sense of closure. Overall a good game, just not a good Fallout game. 6/10","December 20, 2015","false","39.0"," 59 of 104 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","59","104","3","2"

I did every ending just to see if there is a decent ending but I was very disappointed. I didn't feel anything for the characters, I didn't even feal bad when a certain character died. I also felt like there wasn't enough lore involved. The side missions were very repetitive, its basically clearing a area of enemies or finding an object of value. There were some cool missions like defending the atom cats and the last mission was actually a fun mission. 3/10\n\nGameplay- I was absolutly blown away with the gameplay. I was expecting Fallout 3 gameplay but I was wrong and happy about it. The gunplay is how a shooter should be whether you like third  or first-person games Fallout excels at both. I thought the melee combat was pretty good but I was kinda disappointed because there wasn't enough variety of melee weapons and the blocking is kinda weird. The power armor felt perfect, it felt heavy and bulky, it needed a power supply to keep it running which was cool. MODS!! 9/10\n\nCustomization- Customization in Fallout 4 is fantastic there are almost unlimited possibilities with guns at least. You can make an automatic rifle out of a pistol which is awesome. I felt like there wasn't enough crafting for melee weapons though. You can customize your power armor in so many ways, you can put vault-tec colors on it, hot rod red, flames, ect. and you can customize how much damage it can take before breaking. I didn't really customize other types of armor because of legendary armor. The base building is a fantastic idea but it wasn't done well you cant put walls on a destroyed house that you cleared of all scrap without putting a wood floor on or you can' make default building bigger and you can't remove them, also there wasn't enough things to build in my base to keep me doing it for more than one settlement. 9/10\n\nThe Open World- This is a Bethesda game so you know the world large and will be filled with interesting enemies and cool loot. The world is the same size as Skyrim except there are no mountains so it feels smaller but it is filled with more places to find. The Glowing Sea is my favorite area in the entire game and possibly my favorite area in any Fallout, there is always radiation so you need to prepare before going and its where the coolest enemies live and it is entirely destroyed with gas staions and power plants in ruins it just feels cool. The commonwealth doesn't feel as it should (at least for me) it doesn't feel like a nuke was dropped near it, there are too many buildings and people in it. 9/10\n\nGraphics- Everyone knew from the trailers they were going to be bad and they were. The lighting makes the game not feel like a Fallout game but it for sure makes the game look pretty. The textures look terrible at points, the framerate can dip below 40 fps even with a gtx 970, the facial animations are the best out of any Bethesda game but are trash for a next gen game, the synths look like terminaters. There are lots of graphical glitches you can see alot of them on the tallest bulding. The depth of field and Lighting saves Fallout 4 from looking like a ps3 game. In less than a year there will be photorealistic graphics and better framerate. 7/10\n\nTotal: 74/100","January 15","true","89.4"," 36 of 61 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","36","61","0","0"

At level 1. With a 10mm pistol. That i name pea shooter. And there was a death claw. Yeah...\n\nAfter this i managed to explore for about two hours before fast travelling back to one of my settlements to start demolishing everything to build up my base. Figured i'd have a look at the map to see how far i managed to get in two hours, i got the smallest amount away you could imagine. This game is FULL of things to do and explore. I then spent just over 2 hours building one house, filling it with lights, beds, giving it power, making sure there was accessible food and water nearby, carefully placing turrets in case of a raider attack or anything like that.\n\nThis game WILL feel a little weird coming from Fallout 3 or New Vegas, but everything in this game is a huge step forward in a very positive way.\n\n\nFor anyone wondering, i play it maxed out in 1080p, keeping a steady (vysnc on) 75fps at almost all times. Very rarely will it drop at all, if it does drop it's for about a second where i'm assuming the game is loading up the next chunk of the map.

That its more of a chore than it is fun. I almost compare this game to the sims with all the micro managing of the colonys. I would not mind the building system and the colony managing but the it is so clunky and bugy and mind numbingly frustrating. I put it down for a few months thinking "eh once they patch this game it will be playable". NOPE The easiest things are ridiculously hard. And not to mention I have a R9 390X that strugles for some reason to play this game at 30FPS. I have no idea why it struggles slow this game is ugly! The graphics are horrible!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/leewells2000/recommended/377160/","leewells2000","Chip Patton","http://steamcommunity.com/id/leewells2000/","22 products in account","Expecting an improvement to FO3, I was highly disappointed; however, I imagine that if I were expecting an improvement to Call of Duty or Battlefield, I would be elated.\nINTRO\nI really hate doing this, because I loved Fallout 3 so much, but I'm just going to be honest here.  Beth missed the mark by serving up a game that targets Battlefield and COD audiences and not their RPG majority audience and fans.\n\nBefore I start with the review, I would like to notate that Beth did make a critical story error, moreover, and advertising error.  There is only one choice of the ending -- (spoiler) either you nuke the commonwealth or side with the "boogymen" and not nuke the commonwealth.  Neither choice is something a sain human would adhere to.  There should have been alternatives, a way in which to convince this faction or the other to peacefully resolve their issues.  Afterall, if this is a "REAL RPG" then your charisma stat should have some impact in the story, right?\n\nIn short, there is no real choice in the story; regardless of what you've been led to believe, even from the fanboi reviewers and "professional critiques" out there.  No matter what you do, no matter the dialogue options, it has absolutely no impact on the story itself or the ending sequence, except for what is stated above.  In fact, you should have a look at some other reviwers out there that were modders for the TES toolbox (the same toolbox used for FO3), they found that there are only 2 possible endings (exactly as I stated above in the spoiler).\n\nTHE GOOD\n1) The colonial building system was very decently done, and gives the player something else to focus on rather than the bad points of this review.\n2) The weapon modding system was pretty neat.\n3) Being able to wear your power armor on top of your armor and jump suit allowed you to feel like you were truely armored and tanky.\n4) Game is modable (hurry up with the tool please beth)\n\nTHE BAD\nSadly most of the stuff above lead to the bad below...\n\n1) The textures in this game were atrocious on ultra settings.  Nothing struck me as being real and I lost immersion nearly after the first 15 mins of the game.\n\n2) The side-quests are repeatable cookie-cutter quests.  There are 2 types of these quests: Go kill XXXXX and return or Go rescue kidnapped XXXXX and return.  That's it!\n\n3) There are NO SKILLS in this game.  This game is literally Battlefield 3 with 3 ending options -- Mass Effect 3 and Battleifled 3 had a baby and made FO4. You level up, you spend a point into a perk -- that's it... BF3 style level up.\n\n4) There are NO CRITS!  You have to manually enter VATS to crit on anything using a crit meter.  And unless your preception is 10 or the mob is in your face, you can't hit anything in VATS anyways so it is a major waste of time to use.  VATS seemed to just get in the way when I accidentally hit Q.\n\n5) The story had severe continuity issues -- what's this about all these missing kids? Who the hell took them all?  We don't know.\n\n6) Power suits and the ability to buy the power cores from venders made this game way too easy.  I'm sorry but being able to walk right through super mutants with a minigun mowing them down without losing a single % of health is rediculiously easy.\n\n7) Nothing has an impact on anything except for the choice of faction you join..  So I build a 30 citizen community... So what?  What does it do? Nothing, absolutely nothing.\n\n8) You cannot craft bullets or weapons.  This is a huge turn-off for me.\n\n9) Its a small world after all... Yeah, its not just small its TINY.  You can walk across this map in 2 minuites, real time and live to tell about it.\n\n10) I beat the game, I listened to all the dialogue, I didn't cheat, and I completed all non-repeat sidequests.  Now look at my play time and you decide of this game is worth $60.00.  Keep in mind the ending-options completely demoralizes the player from playing again or continuing to play, so there is zero replayable value.\n\nSUMMARY\nSo why did I not recommend this?  Most people that I know that played FO3 were fans of TES and the like.  They liked the games because of their RPG elements, complexity, etc.  I said it best to a friend who was playing while in TS3 yesterday as I quoted prepended to the begining of this review.  Besides what is listed in the good, the only RPG elements in this game is that you get to name your character, purchase perks when you level, and interact with your companion.  Even chosing a diologue option does not affect the quest or dialogue in any way, shape, or form -- it is simply there as a cosmetic so that you think you have "choice" but in fact the story does not change in the least.  Again, the only thing that matters is what faction you side with.\n\nI truely feel as if the developers took a major shortcut in this game.  Instead of giving us a fully developed game-world, they gave us an empty map with one city and the ability to build our own cities and said "have fun!".  This is not what I expected, and if I wanted to build cities with radioactive ghouls trying to eat my face, I'd play 7 Days to Die.  I was expecting rich content and a world "four times that of Skyrim" and what I got was a Mass Effect 3 story line and ending with a map that was 1/10 of Skyrim.  I cannot recommend this game unless it is on sale for $20.00.\n\nSIDENOTE\nAsk those giving positive reviews the following:\n1) Do you work for Beth?\n2) Have you completed the game?\n3) Do you play COD?\n\nGuaranteed, if the first is no, the second will be no or the third will be yes.\n\nUPDATE\nAs of Nov 22 I have put some more time into the game, basically I had found 3 possible factions to end with and was told it was possible to use the Minutemen to end the game.  I tried a fresh playthrough with this, and come to find out the ending sequence is identical to the Railroad ending, except Liberty Prime is a lot easier to take out using the minuitemen -- and I have to say with the exception of being a disappointment for your child (being a father of 4 myself, this paternal emotion was hard to shake) it was the easiest ending to accept.\n\nThough I still hold to my review that things are out of place, and if the player sides with the institue, there is never any option to allow the player to fully redeme the reputation of the institue (or destroy it) and bring them from the shadows and involve them more above ground.  This is a flaw of the game that makes me think this "short" ending option was rushed to completion.","November 13, 2015","false","274.5"," 163 of 299 people (55%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","55","163","299","9","12"

I don't write reviews usaly but for some reason fallout 4 compells me to put somthing down. The first thing that struck me about this game is the amount of stremlining done, this is NOT a fallout game its a consolised wackamole shooter with "rpg" elements tacked on there.\n\nThere are no skills its all based on stats and perks every level up you get a choise to either raise a stat or choose a perk assuming yout stat is high enough for it. All the perks are tied to your core stats. This is lasy design as far as i'm conserned.\n\nIt also effectively stripped out all the tools you would normaly have to define who you are in the game world. Bethesda seemed to let there maketing department call most of the shots here so much so that they forgot the golden role of rpgs the idea is to give players more options not less.\n\nOur background and motavation is already defined for us. there is a family dinamic tossed in there to try and get you to care only to be discarded with in 2 minutes (with the ocational emo line here and there to try and keep it relavent.\n\nI wanted a falout game not a cod/ borderlands/ massefect mashup, but thats what we have here. The new conversation system is a joke, want to find out more information? Sorry you only get to pick 3 options and they through in a snarky and a persqade option in there to make it look like an rpg.\n\nThe way critcal hits are handled are perticularly annoying insted of a percentage chance to crit when you hit somthing now its all put in a crit pool that builds up every time you hit somthing in vats. then you can pull off your special move like its a fighting game.\n\nYou can build your own towns which on paper sounds good, untill you see how limiting it really is. the games interface is horable on pc this is perticularly aparent when your trying to build and place things. One button rulles them all here. i.e I placed a building, great now lets go in and place stuff in it. but more often than not I have to fight with the interface if you hapen to have the building highlighted (and it happens every time you walkin to one in build mode) the key you have to use to select stuff to place in the building also picks up seid building.\n\nProblem could have been solved with an actual working ui. But then I realised how utterly pointless the setelment system is. Its just busy work to grind money or resorces (very slowly) not to mention you have to drop what your doing to go and devend these places even if you never bothered with them or the building stuff.\n\nI mean why have the devs build interesting towns when they can just have the players do it farmville style?\n\nAll this and they just give you power armour with in 15 minutes granted its gimped by the fact you have to get power cores to use it but still. Getting power armour in ffallout games is a rite of passage it tells you that all that hard work ment somthing and now you can go and stamp your will on the wasteland. devs- Nope people dont have the patence lets just give them it now.\n\nThis game is not fallout to me, sure it has the trapings of fallout but none of its soul. i'm willing to bet that fallout 5 will just play it's self at the rate the dumming down is going. My advice is save your money if you really want to play it be aware that its not a fallout game and wait for a sale.\n\n\n","November 17, 2015","false","107.0"," 45 of 78 people (58%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","58","45","78","4","0"

Was it worth the wait? Yes. Is it a good game? Yes. Is it a good Fallout game? Kind of.\n\nIm a huge fan of FO3 and NV but so much has changed in FO4 that it does not feel like a Fallout game as much as it should have. First of all the dialogue options and the voiced actors. Dialogue options SUCK compared to the last two games. It's basically "yes" "no" "sarcasm" "some other stupid ♥♥♥♥" FOUR OPTIONS, (Its not always like this). You dont know what the character is going to say to the NPC because of the short dialogue options, it says "yes" but the character says just more than "yes". Basically i want it to contain the whole sentence the character is saying not just a part of it. I've had times where my character lies without me knowing it.\n\nSpeech checks are like FO3 but the % has been removed now its colored (yellow-easy, orange-medium, red-hard). I dont have much of a problem with voiced actors, thats fine with me but some people hate it.\n\nNow let me talk about Quests. I dont like alot of them, some of them is just you either do this or you dont. Theres no solving the problem or maybe doing something else. Like i said either you're in or out. But keep in mind not all of them are like that, some did have more options and i liked that.\n\nSkills are gone now its just the S.P.E.C.I.A.L system and perks. Most of the perks are from older games just maybe changed a bit, others are new and pretty cool, i liked it.\n\nGraphics: Does the graphics "SUCK ♥♥♥♥ING DONKEY ♥♥♥♥" like everyone is saying? The graphics have improved alot. Better colour and no gross green/orange filter. But its not the best either. Textures sometimes takes time to load like on Proctor Ingram and her armor for example.\n\nI dont have time to talk about everything so let me just make a TL:DR.\n(Sorry for the long text i just wanted to back my arguments up)\n\nPros:\nGreat combat\nWeapon and armor customization is so much fun.\nCooking food and making chems.\nGraphical improvements\nBuilding settlements is also very fun (not required)\nAlot more harder than previous titles.\nExploring is wonderful theres alot of stuff to explore and to fight bad guys that live there for example Dunwich Borers was really cool.\nUnique armor and weapons are awesome.\nStory is decent, it had me pretty interested.\nCons\nDialogue like i already talked about.\nMost enemies i ran into was just raiders and supermutants but thats just me. You may go other routes and find more of the other cooler and new ones.\nSome parts you need to upgrade and mod weapons are scarce and i just modded my weapons a few times because of this. So if you want to mod alot you need to loot alot.\nSome of the quests like i talked about. (keep in mind not all of the quests are like i mentioned)\nHorrible optimization: my pc has better than minimum and i drop fps at some places AND IM PLAYING ON LOW.\nPeople complain about bugs but honestly ive only encountered a few graphical ones which got fixed after a few seconds.\nThis game is a good game in my opinion its an 8/10 it would be 9/10 if bugs were removed and if they optimized this game better and this is coming from a hardcore FO3 and NV fan. Sure dialogue is bad but its not "♥♥♥♥ING HORRIBLE". Theres alot more positives and i dont have time to write them all. If you want to buy this game then do it, its ♥♥♥♥ing great just some things are removed or changed and i can see why people are mad.\n\n\nPS: If you dont like my review tell me why. Dont just dislike it like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ hater who hates the game for no reason other than "the graphics suck" and whatnot.\n\nPS 2: I have played alot more now and some of my opinions have changed. So if you want to ignore this review.","November 14, 2015","true","166.0"," 133 of 243 people (55%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","55","133","243","6","0"

And it's particularly sad they they can't tie together their game systems the same way a clumsy six-year-old might not be able to tie together his shoelaces.  But their worldbuilding remains top-notch.

Power Armor appears to cause these bugs. I have hit 2 quests that if you have power armor the quest breaks, wiki's will help. Had time to play my friends console (P4), same sorts of issues overall. The story get pretty liniar with 3 core factions I am so far disapointed in the overall path pushed but feel there are plenetly of quests to keep you busy and leveling. Speaking of leveling now that I am use to the system. I do like it. As for the building a base, big letdown. Overall if your fan you will enjoy it, if your not sure, save your caps for now.\n\nUpdate: 20 hours of play - I will admint I am beeing pretty harsh overall but I have a lot to expect from an expensive AAA game that just made Bethesda a boat load of money and they hyped the heck out of it.\n\nThe game takes a bit of time to grow on you. In typical Bethesda style the game has a lot of rough spots typical of their recent releases, NPC pathing is bad. I recently had the boss enemy of one quest totaly fall off the building he was in and kill himself before I knew he was the bad ♥♥♥.\n\nSpeeking of NPC's if you start the game and notice a realy powerfull gun behind an locked case you can't access. Turns out one of the NPC's has a bit of an exploit to help you aquire that gun earler in the game then I think was intended. I don't want to post a spoiler here but lets just say I am not sure the NPC's ablity was intended to work with locked items.\n\nThe UI is HORRID! This is so bad that even on the console versions my friends have the same issues and complaints. (PC) In many places the TAB key is the back button but its the final back that changes to ESC. (PS 4) My coworkers that have consoles say the same issue on their end exists, using something like STAR and chaning at the last dialog to SQUARE or TRIANGLE not sure what they said. Another issue is in building a base when your inside a building that takes up your view TAB is also "select" that item so now you cant change dialog options because your moving the dam building element. You have to find and empty part of the structure that dosn't have any parts to properly select the item you want from your menus.\n\nBuildings: Still useless for the mostpart but I did cheat on one save to see if it ever becomes usefull. The answer is yes eventually becuase once your high enough level you can attract merchants.\n\nPower Armor: My inital thoughts (below) were that it felt like cheating. After 20 hours of play I can say nope its dam well the only thing your likley to give a crank about. You will want to scav every core and save them for when you realy need that power armor becuase its the only thing that has saved me a number of times in combat. I do feel you get enough cores if your scroung and trade for them.\n\nCombat - Intense. Even with good armor and a good supply of weapons I find that I need to change my guns out for ones with ammo, or do more stealth, use cover etc.\n\nV.A.T.S = CRAP, Criticals are now a charge meeter that you have to activate in VATS to use. I see no diffrence using VATS and JET. Both are just bullet time.\n\nThe Second screen PipBoy app! Love it, its very usefull and if you have a smart phone well worth the minor install and config issue to make it work.\n\nGraphics, they just don't feel rich enough. I think mods and DLC will change this with time.\n\nPlot line - pretty linear this time around, your choices to be bad are at least so far limited. In general many more NPC's are considered "critical" and you cant kill them. My character has a charisma of 9 and two persuasion perks and still I am frequently unable to persauade people in dialog. (this is supprising since I basicly wanted more options and in a few places its usefull to avoid combat) the investment in points in this regard are not paying the dividents I had hoped for. Another ding for the UI using freeking arrow keys for dialog options, hate it.\n\nOn a posittive note, there is a ton of content to explore and if you keep a look out there are many situations where you can be entertained by the sugested position of items or bodys etc to get a feel for what happend in that space.\n\nOverall still feel they need a decent update to address a number of issues but the game is a bit more playable at this stage. Bethasda seem to allow for some very genious community updates and changes to their products and I don't think Fallout 4 will be any exception. I look forward to the mod communities contrubtions to filling in the vacuos holes Bethesda seems to have left.\n\n\nEarly Review - 4.5 hours:\n\nIn a word - Underwhelming\n\nSo 4.5 hours in and I can say that I am not really happy with this game. I love the series so I will put up with it but save your money for a sale.\n\nDetails:\nWell they tried and failed in a number of areas, day 1 patch needed, feels like some parts are unfinished, the building settlements bit for instance feels lacking. Lack of adequate tutorial. AI pathing is a joke. I have had enemies falling off buildings, not shot, just running at you, fall and die. Too many chems I guess. Early power armor access feels like a cheat (update turns out its needed)\n\nIf your playing this on a PC be prepared to feel the pain of the crap console UI forced on you. Even that is not intuitive. For instance when looting and manipulating stuff the keys change so picking up stuff goes from say E to R and then getting out of a menu goes from ESC to Tab but when that occurs is very jarring and distracting. You now get 4 dialog options at a time and you have to use the mouse or the arrow keys.\n\nVATS - Say good buy to turn based RPG play. VATS is now bullet time. Worse is in combat if you have an ally, and the friendly AI kills the last enemy while you are trying to select your point of fire with vats, it will automatically target friendlies thus if your not careful you will shoot your ally.\n\nIf it sounds like I am being too critical that is because for $60 and all the hype I had higher expectations. Even the graphics on ultra dosn't impress.\n\nThe Story so far - I won't provide spoilers but I will say that given the events that put you in the vault and what happens as you get out I would have expected a few more breadcrumbs or plot points to engage me. Its early so take this part of the review with a big grain of salt. The NPC's that I have encoutnered and side quests just don't have the conversation depth I had hoped for, that said they are all are voice acted. (update above)\n\nThe Environment – Its expansive but feels off, by that I mean the physics are not clean, the world should be more destructible and interactive and I honestly think that since the primary focus seems to have been on console players that they didn't make the world as interactive because of that. Now I could be totally off base on this and it may be that the UI is just getting in the way.\n\nSync audio to npc mouth/body- This is a huge gripe for me, the audio dialog of the NPC's doesn't feel right when you watch them, the mouths are out of sync and the body language is either absent or not in tune with what is being said. If you like voice over kung fu movies then you will love the dialog with NPC's\n\nThe moderately good:\nThe “second screen” pip-boy app for android & ios devices, that actually is dam cool and useful as well.\n\nI started to get sucked into building a house/town. That's very different for the fallout franchise so it takes some getting use to and it feels clunky at first but after a bit of practice you can loot out a town and turn it into your own kingdom. I haven't seen a need for it yet but it can side track you for some time. (update above)\n\nOverall, I would say unless you are a huge fan and dont mind the rough edges then it might be worth it to you. For the rest, save your money for a sale and don't have high expectations.","November 11, 2015","false","78.8"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","23","37","0","0"

Bethesda has had years to make this game, and its really a letdown from the other fallout games. I really wish I could write a positive review on this game but I just can't. If you've played the other fallout games you would understand, im sure theres people that have played the other ones and love it but i am not one of them. I played Fallout new vegas for 250+ hours on steam and many on the xbox also, I also played fallout 3 on the xbox. Those 2 games were the best fallout games they have made. This game(fallout 4) kills the fallout feel. It turns this game into more of a fps game then the fallout games we remember, It removes alot of the rpg assets the game had that alot of people loved about fallout. It was an attempt to change something that didnt need change. Yes the fallout series is geat storyline great, etc, but not fallout 4. If you really like fallout new vegas and 3 and you like the "fallout feel" to it you wont like this close to as much as the other games. When progressing mid way through the game you just dont feel like continuing to the end, the main quest is completable in a few hours and its pretty lame, all the endings are not satisfying, all the quests are pretty much the same it either says kill this and return or find this and return theres really no other quests, plus its x3 the price of fallout new vegas ultimate edition which is way better... If they make another fallout game and its like this that really sucks because they ♥♥♥♥ed up a good game series it was one of a kind game no other like it or as fun as it. 3/10. Anyone who writes a good review for this game either jumped the band wagon of the hype or is just doing it because its fallout 4. I ran out of content after 70 hours then just stretched the rest...\n\nThe worst parts:\n\n-Power armor is no longer prestige item\n\n-Skills and levels and perks were neutered\n\n-Dialogue choices were also neutered\n\n-All side quests are Clear some raiders and return\n\n-Main story line is not interesting at all its more like\na chore to finish it.\n\n-Character skill customization was ruined along with karma\nyeah you can make your character have pubes on his face but\nit really is not unique with no skill customization\n\n-Not Fallout","January 24","false","94.4"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","23","37","0","0"

I am addicted to Fallout 4 this game is incredible. It is phenomal and just a flawless execution from Bethesda. It has unfortunately taken over my life because of how massive this game is. The map isn't as big as Skyrim but there is more to explore through Fallout 4 because it is overwhelming, each area has it's own story or cool loot. Every area in this game is worth exploring which can easily distract you from the main quest or side quests.\n\nThe voiced protagonist male or female sound spectacular. At first i was hesitant as to not wanting avoiced protagonist since the previous Fallout games never had that. The voice acting for Fallout 4 quite strong, it makes everything seem more believable, the dialogue seems very natural and gives more character to the protagonist especially when you further along the main story. The voice acting is better than it has been in the past franchise.\n\nThe collectibles. You are able to find magazines which adds to your perks permanently, i am glad that Bethesda brought back the collectible bobbleheads which where unfortunately missing from Fallout New Vegas. There is also legendary items you can find or pick up from killing legendary enemies.\n\nBuilding your settlement is optional, you don't have to build your own settlement if you don't want too however if you do decide to build your own settlement it just becomes addicting. Picking up everything through the wastelenad is essential in Fallout 4 where as in the previous Fallout games such as 3 and New Vegas i didn't have too i didn't see it as a purpose unless it was to mod your own guns in New Vegas. Picking junk through out the wasteland in Fallout 4 adds to modding, building your settlement, reinforcing your armor or just making drugs. It can be difficult at times but you're easily able to search for certain items if you want to mod all you have to do is tag them. Overall Bethesda did a grat job at handling the settlements.\n\nMy thoughts on the main story is basically an emotional rollercoaster ride, it's not what you expect and the storytelling is is unique despite the fact that it is a reversed Fallout 3 where as in Fallout 3 you're trying to find your Father but in Fallout 4 your trying to find your son. I won't spoil the game anymore since the story is amazing, it's one of Bethesdas best story yet.\n\nMy thoughts on the sidequests, it's better than the main story. The faction quests are amazing, even quests you just pick up randomly. The lore is still good, where it can really make you think and make up your own assumptions. I feel Bethesda has respected the lore of Fallout in Fallout 4. Just take your time to read the terminals, listen to the holotapes and read the texts.\n\nEach companion is distinct and has there own personality, each companion has there own perk which you get to keep. Some of theses companions have there own story and quests these characters are unique and interesting in there own way. You get to develop friendships with these companions and then eventually romance them where as in other non Bethesda games you talk to someone and straight away you see a cut scene and straight away its a sex scene. Bethesda has handled the romance option the best in terms of gaming where you have to build upon a relationship.\n\nThe game is very challenging. You may have to run away at times because your character is too weak, the game is not easy in any way. The a.i. seems smarter and Fallout 4 adds in many new enemy types that are really cool. Beware of Swan.\n\nThe leveling system in Fallout 4 seemed confusing at first but it's easy to get used too once you start leveling up. All the perks are all worth while. All the perk ranks adds new perks and adds really good character builds where as it can effect your play style.\n\nBethesdas soundtrack is amazing along with the radio stations. So glad there is no Johnny Guitar however i do want more radio stations in the game.\n\nThe performance of the game is excellent. My only problem is that the game stutters when i am at the menu screen or when i go to save my own game. I play the game on high settings not ultra high.\n\n\nIf you're a Fallout fan or a non Fallout fan pick it up. It's worth every dollar, it's one of the best Open World games out there. This game simply gets an easy:\n\n9.5/10","December 29, 2015","true","207.0"," 325 of 604 people (54%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","54","325","604","24","15"

I never used V.A.T.S. before, and the new gunplay system makes that easier than ever.\n+Weapon/Armor modding system is fantastic and wonderful. As promised.\n+Engaging sidequests, and an interesting main story, what little I've played of it\n+The settlement-building system is quite fun, if a little wonky at times (If building a corner to your hut, don't use the pre-built corner. Place a wall down, then place a roof, and the corner can naturally be built with another wall. That was my first hour of trying to build, so hopefully I save somebody the same frustration).\n+While there are some bland characters (looking at you, Garvey), there are far more colorful and fascinating characters.\n+I know a lot of people don't, but I actually really enjoy the voiced protagonist. While the conversation options are somewhat lacking, compared to previous Fallout games, the depth of the voice actors' performances for your character more than makes up for that.\n\nCons:\n-A few bugs, one which I've experienced twice now, in which my companion is perma-stuck in the laying down position like they're hurt. It's an easy fix, though--just shoot them until they're really down, and then get them back. Other people have experienced some game-breaking bugs, but thankfully, I haven't yet.\n-Minor, minor, minor performance issues. Some frame-rate drops inside of lighting-heavy buildings due to their new lighting system that could definitely use some patching. It's not unplayable (for me, it's a drop down to ~25-28 fps, which I can tolerate), but a little annoying at times. The Library and Corvega were the worst offenders for me, hands-down. Other than that, there's occasional stutters when in the Commonwealth, but so few and far between that I hardly notice. Runs great otherwise, on med-high settings. With the patches that I hope are incoming for the lighting, I hope that I can drop the medium and run on the high like Fallout initially recommended.\n-Sort of going back to the bugs post, my guns occasionally like to take what feels like a decade to pull out, when switching between them using the hotkeys in battle. It'll put away the old gun, and not pull out the new one until I've taken a sound thrashing from the Super Mutant I was hoping to blast away with a shotgun (IF I HAD ONE...equipped). Whilst not game-breaking, I do hope that gets a visit. The switching works fine through the Pip-Boy, and also through the app, but the hotkeys can hesitate, and hesitation hurts, a lot. I can only run so fast, since it also disables my sprinting while frozen in the gun-switching limbo.\n\nOverall/tl;dr:\n\n10/10, would (and will) Commonwealth again.","November 16, 2015","true","194.6"," 204 of 377 people (54%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","54","204","377","11","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/recommended/377160/","Lunaril","Lunaril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lunaril/","880 products in account","Fallout 4 is the Sixth Title released in the fallout series, and the Third released since the series was revived in 2005. The story takes place in the ruins of the Commonwealth of Massachusettsand and surrounding areas. The best way I can describe the Fallout 4 experience is think of Fallout 3, having a child with Borderlands 2. The skill system and perks are vastly different from prior titles in the series. Vats is no longer a stop-motion targetting system, but instead a slow-motion one.  Playing on survivor mode is a challenge, but the AI seems less advanced than Fallout: New Vegas.\n\nThere are a lot of mixed reviews coming out about Fallout 4, mainly I think because people have expectations of what they think it should be. What you need to remember is, Fallout 4 is supposed to be a better performing game, this means there needed to be changes to the way previous fallout titles were made. I think they did a good job of balancing everything, as Fallout 4 appears to have a lot less bugs than Fallout 3 and New Vegas put together; However, there are clipping issues in a few places I've discovered, but other than that I haven't run into any major problems.\n\nThe building system, where you build your own fort on the ruins of Sanctuary Hills feels a little like a first person shooter version of Fallout Shelter, taking place above ground. You can create various stations, trader stalls, resources, defenses, building components, furniture, and more. You need to defend your town against creatures and invaders alike, and are able to build your town to attract new residents from the Commonwealth Wasteland. This part of the game feels like a separate game in itself at times, and can be a lot of fun.\n\nAs far as the exploration options, the map is very small compared to the size of New Vegas. Some have compared it to a similar size as the Fallout 3 map, though I have noticed individual buildings seem to have their own internal instances, which might explain why the map is a little smaller. There are familiar landmarks from Massachusetts, which are always a nice touch in the Fallout Universe. The beginning tutorial pre-war is absolutely fantastic and whets the appetite for more pre-war content.\n\nFor all the differences to previous fallout titles and the inevitable disappointment some will have at this, Fallout 4 is actually a pretty good game. It is still fun, not as RPG as previous titles, but still an extension of the Universe and thus worthy of a playthrough even if you don't care for for the changes. I personally find it enjoyable to play, the story interesting, and the visual effects to be a nice change from previous titles. I would strongly urge fans of the series to give this game a chance and am excited to see what Downloadable Content, Bethesda comes out with.","November 10, 2015","true","275.8"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","62","24","39","3","5"

I for one regret that I didn't get this on a sale as my economy isn't that great and this game ain't, imo, different enough from Fallout 3 and New Vegas for me to buys it at full price.\n\nPersonally I think this game is good, not brilliant, not what I hoped for, just good. As a sequel it's very safe and doesn't take any risks what's o ever, that is not exactly a bad thing in itself but to me this game feels just like Fallout 3 HD edition with some extra fluff. The thing that could have changed my mind is a great story, to bad Bethesda hasn't accomplished that since Morrowind.\n\nIf you love Fallout 3 you're gonna love this game,. If you love Fallout New Vegas you're probably gonna be a bit disappointed in the characters and story but still like it. For me this game didn't live up to the hype but it's still a good game. I would probably rate it 7/10, nothing special but still fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cdvever/recommended/377160/","cdvever","Dnyawa","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cdvever/","92 products in account","Fail of the year. Or the whole decade.\nSince 2002, when I played Fallout 1 for the first time, it had been my favorite game series, but it isn't so anymore. I had been waiting for Fallout 3, then I tried to excuse developers, than they made a little bit uncanonical game, because preferences of gamers had already changed for all these years. I was excited with New Vegas, when I realized they tried to bring the spirit of old Fallout back. At least devs kept the role-playing system untouched, even if the game became more action-based, thats okay, noone makes completely turn-based RPGs in 2010s. But lets talk about what I can see right now...\nI can skip the first scene, when you can meet your wife and son. Nothing special. Game tries to make you attached to them, but you cant be, the scene is too short and unemotional. I think the basic plot of the game is your regret about your dead wife and kidnapped son. But for me they were just episodic characters and I can totally forget about them after leaving the vault.\nThe vault... What the hell? Why the entrance to the vault is an elevator right from the ground? Why all the rest vaults have the same entrance in the cave or at least in some basement, and designed with the same pattern? Is 111 soooo special that it has its own style? For sure game designers thought they should do something new instead of old scenery, but guys, you make a game that has almost 20 year old history, and there are so many things you CANT change in this way, if you want to name your game "Fallout". The vault is very primitive inside, only one floor and little room with cryogenic chambers. After your awakening it looks like you have to kill more radroaches then the count of people who can fit into the vault.\nAfter killing roaches (the easiest thing, cause you have almost unlimited Action Pts!) you escape to the wasteland. I said wasteland? Oh no, just forget this word. The world looks like typical russian village in autumn. Slightly broken houses, naked trees everywhere, yellow leaves on the ground. Fresh leaves mean that they fell down not long ago, right? Well then few weeks ago the trees were green like there was no nuclear war at all.\nI go back to your house. The friendly robot welcomes me and all I wanna do is to ask him about all this time when I was asleep. So many questions in my mind, I cant wait to ask them all... But I cant! I ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ cant! All my questions are 200 YEARS? MY WIFE? MY SON? SARCASM! Remember the times when you chose between six replies, and decided which one characterizes your kind of alignment the most? You won't see this anymore. There is no role-playing in dialogues. Just quiz with Yes or No answers.\nDo you still hope that you can find some RPG in leveling up? Of course no! Your character has no more skills such Guns, Speech, Lockpick etc., you cant promote them after level up. You just can add one more point to your SPECIAL stat or gain new useless perk. Are you serious, Bethesda? Even casual Dragon Age has better role-playing than F4.\nI got quest, to go to the marker on map. Okay, lets try. I've just killed about 30 enemies, including radroaches, flies and molerats at the gas station. I need some rest, because I wanted to play RPG, not action-FPS. I hoped to find some shelter with survivors who can explain me whats going on around here, and maybe game touches me with its interesting plot. I approach to the marker and... Pew pew pew! Bang! Raiders! Raiders everywhere! I have to fight again! Non-stop fighting right from the beginning of the game! Is this really Fallout? Maybe I bought Call of Duty by mistake? All right, I gonna kill all the raiders outside, but please, let there be peace and calm inside of the building. All I really want is to meet some NPCs, to be introduced to the plot. I begin to laugh hysterically cause inside I meet even more enemies than I've already killed before! Is that thing you call RPG??? Non-stop shooter after leaving the vault? ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ dialogues with Yes/No answers? World design that doesn't match with original series? Hell no. I gonna leave this. Quit the game and ask my money back.\nI'm sorry, Fallout. Years ago you changed my life, but now these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s changed you.\nRest in peace.","November 12, 2015","false","0.8"," 130 of 239 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","130","239","5","2"

You take her to a doctor and wait for 24 hours, how do you settle a 200 year old grudge between an ex cop and his last uncracked case? You find 8 discs in what is a blatant fetch quest requiring 0 puzzle solving and take him to a little room whereupon he shoots a guy in the face. The first companion most people meet doesn't even have a questline associated with her despite an intrigue set up with the mayor of the starting town, there are 2 companions whose quests were interesting and worthwhile. Story wise it just screams wasted potential from every orifice. The only redeeming features of the story are the ending sequence when you first access the institute and a few sidequests that could be counted on one hand, not necessarily an intact hand either.\n\nYour character perks and SPECIAL stats make no difference in quests, except once, just once, when I was rebuilding a ship, once in 140 hours of playtime, in an RPG. Even the secret science lab full of brilliant scientists allows you to contribute nothing even with 11 Intelligence and maxed out science perks.\n\nAnd as a final mark of shame they're selling a 30 dollar season pass with no idea when/what DLCs are being released.\n\nIn short, Fallout 4 is an experience I would compare to having a long lost friend show up after several years and ♥♥♥♥ into your upturned face, then ask you pay him for a possible return visit where he will most likely ♥♥♥♥ into your face again for a little bit.","February 5","false","168.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","10","13","2","0"

This game barely qualifies as an RPG, it's more of a shooter than anything. Even as a shooter, the guns feel limited as most of the weapons you'll be finding are pipe pistols, combat rifles, and assault rifles. The customization isn't even very good for the most part, considering how they advertised it. Most of it is just changing the damage of the gun, and what does change the appearance is usually still not too great. It isn't a bad system, it's just not what I expected after E3. The story itself feels bland, and the ending is super disappointing. Don't expect the slideshow from previous games, as there are only around 9 slides, 8 of them locked as the same no matter what you do. With how perks were handled in Fallout 4, you never have a reason to do a real second playthrough, as after a while you'll be ending up as the same character anyways. WIthout skills that you can't even max out, your character will inevitably end up the same as everyone else's character. This game feels like a watered down version of Fallout minus the RPG elements, and I'm sad to say it. Hopefully Bethesda gives Obsidian a shot again, and we can hope that they do things right with this new engine. All in all, if you're looking for a shooter that gets old after a while, you can still go for this game. Just don't expect a good RPG with a fun story and a real sense of character progression.","January 11","false","147.5"," 73 of 132 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","73","132","5","8"

Bethesda did a great job in the transition from the old Fallouts to F3, and though I did not like the setting of New Vegas, it overall was even better. It was an almost perfect formula of first person, role-playing, and story/setting that followed the originals. Fallout 4 is a completely different mixture and to me, does not fit well with its predecessors.\n\nFallout 4 implements new aspects that were "successful prototypes" in other games, such as the dialogue style in LA Noir, the building options in Rust or 7 Days to Die, and weapon modification in Dead Space 3. While these aspects were great in the list games individually, Bethesda did a poor job implementing them to work together and makes the game play with redundant aspects.\n\nDialogue has over thousands of lines, which though amazing work, ends up pointless. After playing a while, you will find that while in F3 or F:NV you could discuss multiple things and come back for more, F4's dialogue, in short, lists four different ways of saying the same thing. The top option will be an informative version, asking for information while answering. The bottom usually is sarcastic, the left can be optimistic, and the right will be negative/insulting. Example:\n"Hi, would you like this bottle of water?"\n-"Yes, where did you get this?\n-"Sure, could use a tasty beverage"\n-"Wow thank you so much"\n-"Yeah now screw off"\nWhen this occurs through the entire game, you begin to realize it's less of an RPG with choice and more of a set track.\n\nBuilding settlements is a fun side hobby and it practically a game unto itself, but once you complete hours of building defenses, prepare to do battle...with nothing, unless it's a mission. The only time I have ever had a settlement attacked is, you guessed it, when you talk to Preston, and this is only so you can grind XP.\n\nSame goes for weapon customization. The issue is you can build almost any weapon instantly because you no longer have skill requirements, usually only need level 2 of a perk, can find the best off of enemies, and there is no degredation. In a few hours of scrounging around, you'll have more weapons than you'll know what to do with and just drop/sell them.\n\nLately the big thing is Survival Mode and DLC, which sealed the deal with this review as of now. Initial Survival Mode was a complete insult to hardcore/survivalist players because the only thing it did was increase the spawns of legendary creatures. That would be "Legendary Mode"...\nNow Bethesda is scrambling to make it right, and their idea of that is forcing players to eat and drink four times as much as a human would, disable console(good luck if you glitch or get stuck), and only allow you to save via sleeping in a bed. I have tried to see the logic in doing this versus using New Vegas' Hardcore Mode as a starting point instead, and found nothing.\n\nThe current DLC is Ok at best. While I enjoyed and recommended Automatron despite its sudden start and stop of a quest, Bethesda has been giving portions of what they've been advertising. By the time Wasteland Workshop came out, several mods had already included most of what was included. Bethesda will advertise that F4 has the largest map and it does, but a large fraction of the map is open water. This applies to a lot of things they will say about this game. The hype was real, the advertisements and expectations of most...were not.","April 26","false","144.1"," 38 of 66 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","38","66","3","14"

I am going to borrow a paragraph from another review because it summed it up nicely for me:\n\n"Do you remember when Fallout games where RPG’s? Where your choices had a real effect on the world around you? Do you remember when the choices you made during gameplay actively affected quest lines and companion interactions? Do you remember when you could end a war with a tyrannous faction using words and emotion rather than brute strength? Well, Bethesda decided to forget all of that. There are no choices to make in Fallout 4. All options eventually lead the same way. You have absolutely no say in where the story goes, and this is made even worse with the edition of the dialogue wheel. Each option: “YES”, “NO”, “SARCASTIC”, and “WHAT?” all mean yes in Bethesda’s eyes. No matter what you choose, the game will FORCE you to play it the way it WANTS you to play it: As the good guy.

Ok, lets get the good out of the way.  It's the best looking Fallout to date and the gunplay has been improved immensely.  I'm devistated to say that's almost all the good I can say.  I have over 1000 hours in New Vegas and I figured out the difference.  4 just feels like another generic open world to me. The story is just barely passable and coherent. The Karma system is gone (good riddance some say), but along with it, so is the amazingly deep faction system from 3 & NV. By endgame I felt my choices made little to no difference. Especially since pretty much any faction you join basically tells you to kill ALL the other factions. Little choice there. Yes, I there IS a way to not have to kill off anyone but the main 'bad' faction, but does it matter? NOPE.  You get the EXACT SAME ENDING no matter what happens.  It's short, pathetic, and no where near a worthy successor to the massive ending choices in New Vegas.  I left 4 feeling like I had played a Call Of Doody knock off, and that made me livid.  Now if you enjoy constant, repetitive, fetch quests like a daily in an MMO, you may very well love this game. To me it felt like the ideas had run dry and Bethesda just wanted you to think what you did mattered.  But it doesn't.  I pray the Modders and DLC can make this game feel as alive as New Vegas, otherwise, I really hope I can forget it was ever made :-(","January 27","false","290.6"," 21 of 34 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","21","34","0","0"

I have no previous experience with the other games, or any other Bethesda game except for Skyrim. So maybe this review won't be helpful to anyone, but here it goes.\n\nThe character creation system is alright. The 'click and drag' system of shaping the face was slightly cumbersome and often times I couldn't tell what was changing. Playing with a mouse/keyboard it was very difficult to actually highlight the area of the face I wanted, particularly on the nose. There's a weird tone difference on the neck as well, in a triangle shape. The hair and skin tone options were decent, and in the character creation menu my character looked okay. I also liked being able to shape my characters body as far as build. But overall everything looked a bit waxy.\n\nI liked the 'prolouge' portion of the game. I actually liked getting to play a Wife/Husband whose spouse if killed and baby is kidnapped. I didn't get any real time to connect with my spouse and kid so it didn't really make me feel much, but I liked it. The 'Hello Honey' holotape you get from Codsworth was nice, though I do wish we'd been able to find it instead of literally being handed it.\n\nAfter the prolouge is where Fallout 4 started to lose it's intruige for me. The first thing you're told to do after the big introduction of The Main Plot is go find some people, kill some other people, and then spend the next 5 hours building a settlement?? And then maybe find some old lady some drugs so she can tell you vauge things about your kid? There is absolutely no urgency for the main quest and it is very easy to forget there even is a kidnapped child situation going on.\nAnd the few NPCs I've met so far are lack-luster, nothing about them seems special or unique and I really don't even know mcuh about them.\n\nNow maybe I'm just not good at FPSs but the combat is way to difficult for me. There are no difficulty levels and even if you get an enemy within the crosshairs it's no promise you'll hit them. The first time I died was when I got killed by a random oversized fly because I wasted all my bullets trying to shoot it. Even then combat just isn't fun or enjoyable, and with the FOV issues and color palette of the game it's often times hard to tell what's even hitting you. I was in the middle of taking out a raider camp, bullets flying everwhere, and I just saved and quit. That's primarily why I have so few hours invested in this game; i'm already bored. And, from what I've read from other reviews, it'll be quite a while before the main quest picks up again.\n\nThe settlement system feels ultimately useless because you don't have to eat, sleep, or find clean water for your personal character to survive. And I can't see how the income you gain from having one is worth it for all the time and resources you end up sinking into building it. Even running the game on Ultra graphics are lack luster, cartoonish, and obviously dated, especially when you look at things like the Witcher 3 and Dragon Age Inquisition. Some of the landscapes are nice but everything is so desolate and grey it doesn't really matter.\n\nI feel like Bethesda shot themselves in the foot trying to do two things at once. They tried to make Fallout 4 welcoming to new players and forgot about what fans enjoyed about the old games. But they also tried to not alientate the Fallout franchise fans and just forgot to make a descent RPG. They tried to do an open world but then restricted player characters with the prolouge, but then neglected to go far enough in to that story for the sake of the open world to make it any good. Overall I'm extremely dissapointed and I had zero expectations going in, being new to the franchise. I want my $60 back.","November 14, 2015","false","6.8"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","22","36","0","0"

There is also barely any replayability within these faction everything you do in each of these factions has the same goal go get something we need that every other faction needs just so we can re-use it in the other 3 storylines besides the minutemen which is only settlement building (HOW FUN!!!). The only change of each storyline is the ending before The Nuclear Option quest, and they are only a few minutes long either blowing up the prydwen or killing the railroad.  The BOS has completely changed from the BOS in FO3 and FONV were it seemed as though the BOS actually cared for the wasteland but, in FO4 the BOS seems to only care for themselves and just finding technology. Finally there are only a few sidequests I remember that in Skyrim it seemed like it would be impossible to 100% and do all the quests but after 60 hours in Fallout 4 and I've already beaten all of them. After this game being hyped to be the best Fallout ever and it would be revolutionary it is extremely disapointing to see what has happened to it I would say that this is the worst Fallout game besides Fallout: BOS.\n\nMy second point is the Dialog Wheel. OH GOD the dialog wheel I feel like I could talk about this for hours and hours, frankly I feel at sometimes this completely ruined every aspect of RPG in this game. In short the dialog wheel is simple you have four choices: Who are you/What do you want, I want more caps, Sarcastic, and Yes/No. In older Fallout games you could talk to someone for so long and learn all about their character and learn  about what they are all about and you can have choices based on intellegence, perks, skills and what faction you are part of but in FO4 Bethesda decided to scrap all of that away and make it as simple as they possibley can so they can get the most sales, get to the point and appeal to the point of mobile gamers being able to play the game all the way through. Angry Joes review had a perfect point and example of a confercation with an Enclave soldier in Fallout 2 the amount of options and ways you could talk to him were insane and a huge amount of outcomes. If you play Fallout 2 and then play Fallout 4 there is a huge difference in RPG aspects and characters. The Diaolog wheel of Fallout 4 is a huge part of RPG aspects to any fallout game and FO4 ruined the dialog wheel and how the game flows. FalloutNV made a huge step in RPG and Different endings to the story and massive amounts of replayability but bethesda again decided to scrap that.\n\nWell thats enough of my rant, my review for a Fallout game would be: 4/10 but, in general I would say the game is a 7.5/out of ten if you are just a regular gamer who has never played an RPG or Fallout game you will LOVE this game but if you are very into roleplaying and loved early Fallout games you will not enjoy this game continue to play FONV or Fallout 2 or any FO game in general. Sadly, I feel that many FO fanboys are defending it as a good Fallout game just because it has the name of Fallout and they feel extremely nostolgic or they finally have a Fallout game to drool over I did at first but after playing 100 hours of this game Im truly disapointed and it is not worth you money if you are what I listed before\n\n\n","December 6, 2015","false","100.9"," 22 of 36 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","22","36","2","0"

You probalby have already watched reviews on YT, so let me tell you what Fallout 4 ISN'T.\nWhat made Fallout 1&2 great?  Was it the old school hex turn-based combat or the lackluster 640x480@256 colour  graphics? Perhaps the tiny 2d people that could sent other 2d people sliding to the other end of the room after landing on their groin a critical hit by a super sledge?  Well, none of them really...\nYou will wonder, what went wrong with fallout 4 then? The answer will be only obvious if you played the originals. It was the premise that you could  play the game in whatever way you'd like. Did you want to be a soft on words diplomat or an imbecile that couldn't form a proper sentence? How about a manipulative cruel S.O.B ? The freedom of choice was apparent in Fallout 1,2 (and New Vegas in a lesser extent), but not in the case of Fallout 4. You just can't be the bad guy that everyone loves or hates. You can't affect people around you and be treated likewise and people will not frown upon you because your charisma is 2. They will not treat you like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by changing their dialogue lines accordingly, because your intelligence is 1. This  game is uninvolving, blatantly soulless and uninspiring.

You probalby have already watched reviews on YT, so let me tell you what Fallout 4 ISN'T.\nWhat made Fallout 1&2 great?  Was it the old school hex turn-based combat or the lackluster 640x480@256 colour  graphics? Perhaps the tiny 2d people that could sent other 2d people sliding to the other end of the room after landing on their groin a critical hit by a super sledge?  Well, none of them really...\nYou will wonder, what went wrong with fallout 4 then? The answer will be only obvious if you played the originals. It was the premise that you could  play the game in whatever way you'd like. Did you want to be a soft on words diplomat or an imbecile that couldn't form a proper sentence? How about a manipulative cruel S.O.B ? The freedom of choice was apparent in Fallout 1,2 (and New Vegas in a lesser extent), but not in the case of Fallout 4. You just can't be the bad guy that everyone loves or hates. You can't affect people around you and be treated likewise and people will not frown upon you because your charisma is 2. They will not treat you like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ by changing their dialogue lines accordingly, because your intelligence is 1. This  game is uninvolving, blatantly soulless and uninspiring.

I've also completed Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas.\n\nFirst off the graphics are fine - they're the least of this games problems. I'll also say that when Fallout 4 is good it's very good but I honestly can't give the game as a whole more than half marks because there are so many problems with it.\n\n1. The settlement stuff is crap. I'm a lone wanderer, not a homesteader. Don't bother me with having to baby a bunch of strangers everywhere I go.\n2. The new dialogue system is really awful. Because everything is scripted and voiced, you're severely restricted in terms of creating your own character, and it's extremely difficult/pointless to be bad or evil. Also, the choices are very limited - usually to 'yes', 'no', 'sarcasm' or 'tell me more'. Often though, there's really only one choice, and if you pick something else the options re-appear until you pick the 'right' choice to make the game progress the way it was going to anyway.\n3. The leveling system is a huge step backward, and is designed in such a way as to make breaking the game much easier. For example I used to have to wait until I was very far into the game to take 'Ninja' in previous Fallout games. Now I can take it on level 1. Talking of which...\n4. Giving the player access to power armour on level 1 and setting up a confrontation with a deathclaw almost immediately in a game like Fallout is such a blunder from a pacing and progression point of view that it boggles my mind.\n5. The crafting system seems tacked on and feels very awkward. It also seems that they've used arbitrary crafting and level checks to balance an otherwise broken game.\n6. The game becomes more and more tedious and samey as you progress. You're often sent back to the same locations two or three times to do different quests, and while some of the quests are interesting, the vast majority are 'go there and kill everything that moves'.\n7. There is no hardcore mode. Survival mode just means you have to pump more bullets into each enemy and it takes longer for you to heal, but as the leveling system is broken it won't take long before you're flush with ammo and not worrying about healing much anyway. Especially if you use power armour a lot (which I didn't).\n\nIn short Fallout 4 is a decent but not great game with a lot of issues. It's really not progressed much at all in the four or so years since New Vegas (which I'd argue is the far superior game in almost every respect). It's much more of an FPS and less of an RPG than the previous games, which will please some (mostly players new to the franchise) and annoy others (a lot of people who love the previous Fallout games).\n\nMy advice is this: If you love the previous Fallout games then wait until Fallout 4 is heavily discounted. It's worth $30 or so imo.\n\nI'm sure there will be more Fallout games in the future, but this latest has set a few precedents that don't bode well for upcoming Fallout games, so I think it'd be great if they handed the next one to Obsidian, who in my opinion did most things right with New Vegas. That's unlikely to happen though, so I'm not really looking forward to Fallout 5.","January 26","false","268.7"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","14","21","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElegyForMot/recommended/377160/","ElegyForMot","[MSG15 Elite] Elegy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElegyForMot/","161 products in account","Overall: unimpressive.\n\nThe survival/crafting component is super awful. Regardless of how stacked your defenses are, if you don't show up to help your settlements they will literally be exterminated completely. Every camp has the same requirements, location doesn't seem to matter. Some places can access bodies of water and get purified water and you'd think that would matter, but it doesn't. Some camps are a lot smaller than the others and you'd think that would matter, but it doesn't. Some camps are in densely populated areas that have a lot more raider traffic and you'd think that would matter, but it doesn't. Survival mode makes some things matter, but that's all oriented around the player character exclusively.\n\nThe main plot sucks. Faction side quests are all just "Go. Kill/Fetch. Come back. Repeat.", regardless of faction. Your character has minimal impact on the world despite being the main character and often times effective or literal leader of your main-quest faction. Nothing you do can change how the world will perceive the institute, the railroad, nor the BoS. The ending cut scenes only cement this in with one last middle finger to the player about how the world views their faction. You can't make an institute that is more respectful of synths, you can't make a railroad that's less radical, etc. Your character has no impact on the world and that is such a complete 180 from New Vegas, it's absurd. Your settlements aren't even affected by what faction the leader of the minutemen is aligned with other than your selection of flags to hang on the wall as decorations. Also, all of the final battles suck. It will always boil down to a faction war, but much smaller than the likes of New Vegas.\n\nCombat is weird as ♥♥♥♥. You're nerfed, right off the bat. Y'know how you start with 5 points in each S.P.E.C.I.A.L. attribute by default and can add or subtract from there? Now you start with 3. You have to level up to add these points back in, which you WILL have to do, regardless of how you want to build your character because there are too many level ups that you simply would run out of options without investing in a +attribute somewhere down the line. Combat kinda stops progressing around idk maybe level 70? I'm level 84 now on my highest level character and I'm stupidly overpowered. Combat is trivial on Very Hard difficulty and gimmicky on Survival. You scale waaaaay too hard. Critical banker is so OP. Being able to crit 4 + however many times grim reaper's sprint and other perks refill your crit bar consecutively, plus every crit has 100% hit rate without fail even if there's no way for the projectile to actually reach the target is stupidly OP. This means that the early levels are hell and high level are just an absolute joke. You also level up from crafting. That's right. If you're having a hard time, try building and destroying thousands of wooden boxes for a couple hours and sure enough you'll find the game is now absurdly easy.\n\nI'm giving this its own paragraph because what in the ever-loving ♥♥♥♥, Bethesda? Character dialogue. You know how you get to see the first words you'll say in all of Bethesda's other Fallout games? Not anymore. You get a 1 - 3 word snippit or summary of what you *might* say. The left option is often times "Sarcastic" which can sometimes result in your character saying something so ridiculously out of character and negatively affecting your relationships with factions/your companion that you'll want to reload from a save. There's a mod for this that fixes it and restores it to the old dialogue system that is, as far as I'm concerned, essential to gameplay. If you think I'm blowing this out of proportion, play the game and exhaust every single quest like I have. Sometimes your character will just say the most unfitting and inappropriate thing and you'll get a little message "companion hated that" and now your whole situation is worse because Bethesda thought it'd be a cool feature to have minimal control over what you even say. The "down" option is virtually always the "good guy" dialogue and the "right" option is virtually always the "villain" dialogue. "Up" and "left" both have some ridiculous bs going on with what they can make you say with previews that make it seem like your character will say something totally inoccuous.\n\nInventory. Legendary item? Cool, let's preview it to look at the stats and effects because the name isn't entirely descriptive (e.g. "Mighty Gauss Rifle"). Cool, now you have to take this into your inventory, even if you don't want it and/or it will overencumber you. On survival, being overencumbered starts dealing immediately limb damage to your legs because that's how it works in real life according to Bethesda. You've probably picked up something heavy and noticed that your legs immediately broke by 1% and you can't heal those limbs with medicine, only by sleeping. Anyway, the game puts a lot of emphasis on carry weight, especially in Survival mode. In Survival mode virtually everything has weight, even ammo, which I guess is neat as it adds a bit of a challenge to combat planning. Regardless of difficulty, you can scrap miscellaneous objects for parts to help you build, so there's an advantage to having nearly full inventory and then heading back to a settlement to scrap for parts. This is why forced pickups become annoying. The game also has some super questionable item handouts. Some quests will give you guns that you would never possibly want that weigh like 30 pounds and you just have to deal with that, but that's been in the games before. What strikes me as odd is that powersuits are basically permanently available and the game wants you to be using one pretty much all the time by giving you a minigun on your first main quest mission and a powersuit to go with it. Survival mode gets rid of this at least by weighting fusion cores. And fusion cores aren't literally everywhere if you don't go with the BoS, so that's good at least. Your character is brokenly strong enough without a powersuit.\n\nRadiation is now max hp damage. Radiation-resistant gear excluding the hazmat suit always weighs significantly more than other gear. You can go through your game without this being an issue, but let me tell you about the Gamma Gun. You can subvert all of this btw by just taking the Ghoulish perk, but the gamma gun and irradiated mods of various guns found in the game deal huge amounts of radiation damage, like 50+. Irradiated guns can deal huge radiation damage AND physical or energy damage, and for some reason the game like to calculate the -max hp portion first, so you take the full force of both damage types, as the damage will always go into your instanly-reduced hp. I hated this feature, honestly. It's brutal without being fun, and I really don't know what they were thinking with this feature.","March 6","false","144.9"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","1"

I should be the one that defines my own emotions, not the game.  i should choose how i interact with the world.  i should be able to choose who i AM.   without these choices this game lacks everything that made fallout special.\n\nthis isn't fallout.   this is just a game painted to look like fallout.\n\nwith one can of green paint\n\n\nok.  so i have to judge this game as a non-fallout game.\n\nbest way to sum this game up is settlements.   huge part of the game.    settlement construction is obtuse.  settlement management is a disaster.   for all the talk of "streamlining", you would think that settlement management would be...streamlined.   it isn't.    about 13 settlements in, i realize i want to change the way my supply lines are set up.\n\nso i just go to the settlement management window, where all the relevant settlement issues can be easily inspected and dealt with.\n\nwait....no.  that doesn't exist.     instead i have to go to each and every one of my settlements, track down each individual provisioner, and manually change their destination.   keep in mind that provisioners travel between settlements, so in a game where it can be hard to find settlers IN the settlements, finding the provisioner between settlements is a time consuming chore.   "chore" isn't a word that should come to mind when "playing a game".    and be careful that you get the right provisioner.   you may want to change the one travelling from a to b, but end up changing the one going from b to c instead.  because they aren't labelled.   they are all just "provisioner"\n\njust like the settlers are "settler".    how is it that as the person that constructed these settlements i don't know the names of the handful of people living in the town that i built?\n\nhell it would be nice if their names were all just changed to their assigned task.  would be a huge leap to rename the farmers "farmer" and the guards "guard".    as it is there is no way to know who is assigned to what unless they are at their station.    which is a real problem if you stop in to manage things at night or if you use the bell to gather everyone up.\n\ni always wanted to build my own vibrant community in the wastes.    the settlements in fallout aren't vibrant.    they are tedious.    dull.\n\nthis game is such an unbelievable mess.    and i'm not even referring to the technical issues.   the actual game, when working correctly, is a total mess.  and not the fun  "everything is blown up" sort of mess.\n\n\ni could go one about how my inventory is constantly cluttered with dozens of variants of the same worthless gun.   completely disorganized because of the new mod system applying prefixes.    selling all your pipe guns requires searching through every weapon, every time.   because streamlined.\n\nbut i won't do that.\n\nif i went through every aspect of the game interface that defied common sense, i would be writing all night.   the game interface is just BAD.   it is like no one on the design team actually played the game.","November 13, 2015","false","86.0"," 115 of 212 people (54%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","54","115","212","4","0"

One of my favorite features of this game is been able to build your own house and manage your own settlements. For example you have to manage food supply, defences and electricity to keep the population of that settlement happy.\n\nAs for building your own house you have the choice of creating your own design or using one of the preset builds. So once you have built your "dream home" your probably going to want to furnish it right? Well you can with huge variety of items. However this isn't handed to you on a plate, you have to go out and scavenge for materials to create your home and items for it. For example if you see an old telephone or a coffee cup think twice before you pass it off as just useless junk as it can be used for creating items.\n\nThe world of Fallout 4 is HUGE with a mass amount of locations to explore and characters to meet. Unlike a lot of others I don't have a problem with the dialogue, yes there are "only" four options but in a lot of other games there are a similar options and it's not like you don't have a choice what you say. For example dialogue choice 1 will lead to another 4 dialogue options, where as say dialogue 2 is sarcasm will lead to a different 4 dialog options. The four options you get are not all the same in any way and can cause a conversation with a character to go one way or the other and sometimes saying the right things in a conversation get you out of trouble and make you avoid having to kill said character.\n\nOverall for me (someone that has never played previous Fallout games)  this is an all round decent game. I can see myself sinking a ridiculas amount of hours into this game just because of the sheer amount of things there is to do and places to explore.\nI would have more hours in this game but I did not purchase it on release date.\n\n-Huge amount of places to explore, characters to meet, quests to complete and things to do\n-Excellent gunplay\n-Great visuals\n\nA must have even if you have not played any other Fallout games","November 20, 2015","true","127.7"," 162 of 301 people (54%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","54","162","301","8","0"

I sunk, as one can tell by my stats, a good amount of time into this game when I finally realized I just didn't have any genuine interest in playing it anymore.  The quest lines were simply kill, cleanse, repeat.  Gone are all the storylines, choices that matter, and things that have made me love FO.  Gone is the ability to make your unique specialized character.  Basically -- it no longer even felt like an RPG, just a FPS.  A good FPS, but this isn't the game I wanted or fell in love with.\n\nI didn't buy this game for a great settlement building experience or a FPS experience.  I bought it for the experience I had in previous FO's where choices in my SPECIAL attributes matter down to the choices I made in my quests.  This game just felt seriously empty to me.  I'm actually disappointed I bought the DLCs blindly.  I have no interest in picking up the game again -- at least not for the near future.  After 70+ hours, I realized the game wasn't finally going to progress to a point where my actions mattered at all.  It would only ever be endless going to such and such to clear it out of [insert raiders/ghouls/supermutants].  No complex characters, no intriguing dilemmas.  Nothing that made anything feel like they mattered to my character.  Just the endless wastes.\n\nReading most reviews, I guess that's been enough for a lot of people, though.","December 29, 2015","false","77.9"," 33 of 57 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","33","57","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Entar/recommended/377160/","Entar","Entaro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Entar/","157 products in account","Mixed feelings about this game so far...  Compared to the games that came before it, Fallout 4 to me definitely feels like more of an "Open World Shooter" and less of a "Role Playing Game".  The experience felt very on-rails and at no point have I really felt that the character I created and the choices I made had much weight or impact on the gameworld.  With 80 hours in the game I've completed the main quest and seen most of the locations throughout the Boston wasteland.\n\nI found the main quest to be fairly terrible, but not entirely unexpected for a Bethesda game.  Still, it isn't like they deserve a pass for poor writing and limited interactions/impact on quest decisions in my opinion; the story should really just be a lot better than it is.  That branches into another point about side questing in Fallout 4, which is also fairly limited when compared to previous games.  There are very few, and none that I've encountered so far of any substantial length or involvement.\n\nGoing back to the character him/herself, I feel like much of the potential depth has been stripped away with the inclusion of the voice actors (both are good VA's in my opinion) and the limited dialoge options.  As I said the game forces you down that path of "♥♥♥♥♥ure Protagonist" and there is really no room for deviation on your part as the player.  The 3(4) main quest factions while flavored differently, all feel very similar and the endings are all quite shallow, lending to a samey-feel to everything.\n\nIt has been said by many others as well but I think the gameplay system is a regression with the exclusion of skills and simplification into a stat/perk tree.  Most of the perks are uninspirired bonuses and/or rips from Skyrim/fallout 3, with some of the more interesting bonuses only becoming avaliable at final tiers, all leveld in the 30's and 40's... well beyond end-game / content completion for most players.  Itemization is also quite poor in my opinion,   The game has a handful of base guns with a crafting attachment system.  It would seem to expand the # of weapons but in my experience there is a very distinct and linear upgrade path.  Seems about on-par with previous games in the franchise, and certainly mods will expand upon this point particularly.\n\nSpeaking on armor however I feel that the system they implemented was poorly thought through.  The modular armor system allowing you to wear (Helmet / R. Arm / L. Arm / Chest / Undergarment / R . Leg / L. Leg severely limimts your asthetic as only a couple of undergarments can be worn under the modular armor peices, of which there are only 4ish sets (leather/metal/combat/synth/uniques).  The customization is nice but again, the choices are usually very linear as to what bonuses are worthwhile to equip.  It creates an illusion of choice as opposed to a host of unique options.  Ultimately armor itself is almost an afterthought as Power Armor is attained 20 minutes into the game and the fusion cores which charge it are extremely abundant to the point where if one was inclined, they could play the majoirty of the game in power armor with very few breaks in use.\n\nI would note that the world in particular feels rather small and compact.  I can tell that the game has a similar size to Skyrim for example, but the way things are laid out in Fallout 4 makes everything seem much closer together.  Another reason is the fact that there are only 2 main NPC cities and both of them are extremely small and, in my opinion, uninspired.  Perhaps the reason for this lack of cities is due to the inclusion of the settlement system, whereby you can recruit settlers and build up your own towns, but I have to say... that this system is lacking any real meaning or purpose in the game.\n\nIt reminds me of minecraft in that the settlement system is essentially a vehicle for your own creativiity but where there is ultimately no point or purpose to any of it.  Outside of some specific static quests there does not really seem to be a purpose for building defenses and integrating supply lines and bothering with any of the intracacies of it beyond simply being creative.  This may be enough for some players, but the purposeless-ness quickly wore me down.  This is another area of the game where I can see mods making great strides to add depth and meaning.\n\nIn closing I would just say that while I feel I got my money's worth, I am disappointed that Fallout 4 did not have fleshed out roleplaying mechanics and storytelling that were more abundant in New Vegas, 3, even 2 and 1.  There are mods of course, but in the case of Fallout 4 I feel that the game's foundation is lacking to build upon.

Instead of following the main story I decided to spend some time wandering around and exploring. I built up a small base in my starting town and had a nice little setup going, then I decided to play the first main quest. I met a group of characters who immediately asked me to save them, which I did. After killing all of the enemies, that group immediately spoke of my town as if nobody was living there and decided to squat in my town. They not only got constantly stuck on my base and wouldn't go to the guard posts, but they also would not stop complaining/telling me to go away in my own house/trying to force-feed me hippy garbage/harassing me to help them more. The one trying to force-feed me hippy garbage would also frequently stand right in front of my power armour stand and block me from using the menu properly while jabbering away about "my destiny". The one harassing me to help them more talked as if helping them was "the right thing to do", right after invading and squatting in my town as thanks for me helping them the first time.\n\nI remembered that in Fallout games, you can kill NPCs, so that's what I tried to do. I lured the one I hated the most as far away as I could from everyone else so they wouldn't hear the action, and promptly emptied a magazine into their head. They ran back towards everyone else, then after another clip went into their head, they fell down, "unconscious", then 15 seconds later got back up. Then everyone, including my servant robot attacked me. Then the person telling me to go away stole MY fat man out of my storage box and killed me with it.\n\nI had to go into the console, find their NPC codes and change those NPCs from "essential" to "non-essential" to even be able to kill them.\n\nThis is how "free" Fallout 4 is.","March 28","false","26.2"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","65","15","23","7","1"

Played it a lot had fun cant deny. But all the time i had that feeling it could be better. Aside things that have already been said and most of them explain why this is not a good fallout game in more or less variety i would like to write about things i havent seen in any review.\n\nThe respawns. Of items, enemies. First time i met with this thing i was just sad. I started to undestand that this is a "FUN GAME" above everything else.  Wasted all alluminium? no problem you just wait. and where do all the raiders come from? What do they eat? Its wasteland, there are few farms/settlments are they raided continuously? You noticed that the wasteland has far more raiders than normal inhabitants, how is it the farmers are still alive? And more importantly where do all the raiders come from?  You can argue that respawns are there for radiant quests, but maybe these radiant quests could be more inetersting, like go fix a waterpump, secure trade route, parley with raiders.\nI noticed that many of raider base/station/whatever are on bridges, routes, likely place to demand tribute. Well guess what they dont, well in general they dont. Through my 150 hours only once a raider spoke to me and demanded it. I was so happy, i was still hoping that (SPOILER AHEAD) the issue of three big raider gangs demanding tribute from Bunker Hill could be solved in a different way that just kill them. Well it cant, and you only learn about this when you read the terminals.\n\nThen there are Gunners, they have a main base down south there is some vague story, again terminals only. Why Preston doesnt want a revenge? They are mercenaries who take any contract. So i have heard. Ehm ... why cant i hire them? To protect my settlements, my caravans, or to help my fight whoever i want to fight? Why they kill any one they meet? How do they gt their mercenary work if they just straight shoot anybody that comes to them? And what do they eat? Do they protect the settlements from raiders and demand tribute is this how they keep on their group goining? They seem to be a semi-military organization yet Brotherhood doesnt care, they dont see them as threat, they doesnt want to merge them no, why would they? Well why indeed.\n\nSupermutants. OK why are they in commonwealth, how did they get there? And also how they multiply (respawns) they are sterile as far as i remember. And once again WHY ARE THEY IN COMMONWEALTH?\n\nGhouls, nah them are feral its ok, but a kid 200 years in a fridge and it isnt feral/insane/rabid? Ok i guess.\n\nNow if you wander the commonwealth you notice that these groups dont operate in regions where they would rule supreme, no they have bases next to each others together with crazy robots and feral ghouls there is absolutely no point in it. And all of them, have no other meaning in life just to be slaughtered by the vault dweller. It would be okay if the main factions provided more depth and interesting story but they fail. Especially the Railroad, there were so many possibilities on saving synths and do more "under-cover" stuff quest, guess what you just kill at some random location and come back.\n\nFor those: "look anothger 100+ hours downwoter bla bla bla". I have 150 hours of gameplay (150 hours of exploratiopn and base building i was skipping the main quest as long as possible and once i finished it i never played it again, if i finished sooner i would have a lot less hours).

You can easily lose yourself into the endless faction quests and the settlement building sytem (which, don't get me wrong, is actually very good, but pointless) and totally forget to finish the main storyline, thus making you drop the game later on.\nIf you have played the previous games, you will instantly feel that you lost the control you previously had over your character (in terms of RPG). For example, the conversations are pretty straighforward and there are not much decisions to make to actually take "a life path" to say it somehow. Your character cannot be evil or good (or either neutral for that matter), it seems that Bethesda wanted to focus into graphics and additional features and they completely set aside the RPG element of the game.\nCrafting is good and shooting mechanism is way improved over the last installments, but setting this aside there aren't actually any improvements from the last games, if you ask me it is actually a step back in the development of what could have been a great game.\nFor anyone not used to what Fallout had to offer in the past, the game is very good. It is a very good open world FPS with great graphics; but no inmersion whatsoever for a die hard Fallout fan.\nLike many people out there, I'm wishing for Obsidian to take over the franchise again.","May 31","false","225.6"," 15 of 23 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","15","23","0","3"

Everything seems really repetitive and I'm not a big fan of just collecting junk. I never got into the whole modding things as I found it frustrating to find the smallest and hard to find object that would get me my upgrade. With no major enemies other than Deathclaws it always felt like each mission was the same. It also didn't have that spark of getting new abilities that Skyrim had.

For me, the ability to build up the settlements and create small patches of civilization was the best part of the game.  While I did the story lines, and played through to the different endings, and of course got all the achievements, at least 75% of the time I've spent playing has been building up my settlements.\n\nUnfortunately, Bethesda's settlement code really did require Mods to get the most out of it.  I used the mod that allowed you to increase the amount of resources, the mod that moved spawn points outside the settlement, and of course the mod that gave you even more stuff to put in your settlements.\n\nAdditionally, with the size of the world, there are, understandably, a few places (or a lot of places, depending on how define things) where you can get stuck.  The console is the solution here.  The no clip command has saved me numerous times from having to replay 30 minutes worth of game just because my character entered a spot he couldn't leave.\n\nBut now Bethesda has decided you shouldn't use mods or console commands.  If you do, you no longer get achievements.  So I unistalled the mods, but I really don't enjoy the game without them.\n\nSo I can no longer recommend it for the builder/creator type players.\n\nSad to say.","June 4","false","486.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamma77/recommended/377160/","Jamma77","Jamma77","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jamma77/","36 products in account","ORIGINAL REVIEWIs it really too much to ask for a Mixed Opinion option between Yes and No when choosing to recommend a game? I really need that Mixed Opinion for reviewing Fallout 4.\nFrom what I've played of it so far (Just over 11 hours at the time of writing), Fallout 4's quality is really hit and miss. I can't help but compare it to Skyrim (Because I've put more than 1,160 hours into Skyrim, and because it closely resembles Fallout 4 in most gameplay elements), and it comes off better in some areas and a hell of a lot worse in others.\n\nI'm going to start off by talking about the main ways in which I find Fallout 4 to be an improvement over Skyrim. The new looting system is a major improvement, because now you can just however your crosshair over a corpse or container and use the mouse wheel to select items to take rather than having to open a menu, although the option to loot the old fashioned way is still available.\n\nThe fact that there's now a use for all the junk you find on your travels is a nice touch, but it's kind of a double edged sword because now I find it even harder deciding what to drop when over encumbered than I did in Skyrim.\n\nThe way you level up. You now get XP from discovering locations, killing enemies, completing quests, etc., which is a little more realistic than Skyrim where you only leveled up by performing actions that related to a specific skill. The main thing I like is that granting XP for discovering new locations encourages exploration.\n\nThe colour palette is a serious improvement over Skyrim. I have never played Skyrim without some sort of saturation or colour mod installed, but with Fallout 4 the colour is already there, and it's so vibrant that the vanilla game actually does look beautiful, at least when compared to unmodded Skyrim.\nBut now I come to the areas where Skyrim comes out on top in the comparison between it and Fallout 4. As many others have pointed out, the dialogue system has been seriously watered down. I mean, was there really anything seriously wrong with the old system where we could see exactly what we were about to say? And while I understand that It would be a little repetitive to click a full length dialogue option, then have to wait while the voiced protagonist read out that exact same line before you could her the NPC's response, it wouldn't have been that big of a task for Bethesda to have given us a more detailed description of the dialogue options than simply "Yes", "No", "Maybe" or "Sarcastic." I will get to the voiced protagonist later however.\n\nI feel no motivation to explore, despite the XP boost you get for discovering new locations. And yes, this is probably just because I'm on my first playthrough and am therefore more interested in playing through the story than exploring the world, but I still don't find any of the locations I pass through interesting. And usually that’s because they're more often than not infested with Raiders, Super Mutants, or some group of enemies. At when 90% of all wrong turns will have you walking into gun or laser fire, it does kill some of the motivation to actually go out of your way to explore locations besides the one your quest marker is pointing at.\n\nThere is very little sense of actual role playing. Admittedly there wasn't that much in Skyrim either, but there was a damn sight more than there is here. The introduction of a voiced protagonist, and the backstory that's laid out for them in the opening of the game removes the opportunity for you to come up with your own backstory and personality for the character.\n\nThe story premise. I say premise because I haven't finished either of the two games, but the primary motivation of going through Fallout 4's main story kind of feels like Bethesda just took the child searching for missing parent concept from Fallout 3 and just swapped the roles when they came to write Fallout 4.\nAnd now we come to some points that don't really come into the comparisons, but still have an effect on how I judge Fallout 4.The voiced protagonist. While it was a nice experiment, I don't think it should be used again in a Bethesda game, because, as already explained, it most of the roleplaying, and also severely damages the immersion because you don't feel like you're a character you're put together. You feel like you’re playing a character Bethesda have put together for you.\n\nWeapon customisation. While I haven't really experimented with it much so far, it seems to be a pretty good system that allows you to customise your weapons exactly the way you want them.\n\nThe sttlement buildingit looks a little bit like they just ported Skyrim's Hearthfire DLC into Fallout and tweaked it a little bit to let you place the building anywhere you want.\nAll in all, Fallout 4 isn't necessarily a bad game, but I don't recommend it because if you've played Skyrim it just feels like sort of more of the same, with a few improved elements and several watered down aspects thrown into the mix. And I'm not going to comment on how it compares to other Fallout games because, A) I haven't played any (Which in the case of Fallout 3 was I couldn't get it to work without crashing), and B) Because enough people have voiced the "It's not a Fallout game" argument without me falling back on it as well.\n\nADDENDUMSince writing this review, I've come across a few more things that have influenced my opinion of the game.\nThe Wait mechanic. This is another area where Fallout 4 comes 2nd when compared to Skyrim. In Skyrim you can wait pretty much anywhere, so long as there's no enemies nearby. However, in Fallout 4, you have to be sitting down to wait, which, while it may be more realistic than being able to stand in one place for 24 in-game hours like you can in Skyrim, it completely kills the point of including waiting as an alternate to sleeping.\n\nI've had the opportunity to play around with the sttlement building system since I wrote this review, and, whie it works fairly well, and gives purpose to all the random junk that you find lying around, the lack of a detailed tutorial will make your first few attempts at building anything very frustrating.","May 12","false","22.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Level progression is faster and more entertaining, though I can certainly see how some people would dislike the fact they removed actually skill points and replaced them with perk levels. I'm sure everyone is aware of the dreaded dialogue system and yes, it is pretty bad, although I actually liked my character talking, the voice acting was well done and never felt irritating.\nThe characters are...sort of memorable? I don't remember one single character who wasn't a companion, SO many of them fall flat and just don't go anywhere or do anything. The story is pretty abysmal as well, if you've already had the ending "spoiled" for you, don't even worry, the story is so bland, plain and straight up boring you'll stop caring that you know what's going to happen after like an hour.\nThe MAJOR issue with this game right now is the support for it. Or the lack there of. This game, a 2015, PC, Bethesda game, launched with some keys not being able to be rebound. It also launched, and still doesn't support as I mentioned, without supporting Ultrawide monitors, cause you know, those just don't exist right. It doesn't even take long to add in a resolution ffs, and I shouldn't have to download mods and edit files that may or may not actually do anything just to play a game, especially not one from a company that has done PC stuff since forever. Oh, and it also launched with unchangable FOV (you have to manually change it in game files and with a mod), an unremovable 60fps limit (you still can't remove it) that's tied to game physics (WHY DO DEVELOPERS DO THIS HOLY ♥♥♥♥) and unreal amounts of game crashing bugs, most of which are still there. I honestly feel like Bethesda just said "Eh, don't worry, modders will fix it". So now, thanks to this stuff, not only do you have to mod the game to ♥♥♥♥, which takes hours, before you can actually play the game, but now modders can't focus their time on actual creative mods, cause they're too busy fixing Bethesdas laziness.\nI recommend this GAME. What I don't recommend, is putting up with Bethesdas crap. I still cant believe half the things this PC game from an originally PC dev studio doesn't do. It seriously, honestly feels like a port. I don't want to believe it is, but it certainly feels like it. Until this crap is resolved, I just can't recommend it.\nModders are there to make your game better Bethesda. Not fix your crap.\nOr make you money.","December 20, 2015","false","197.2"," 25 of 42 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","25","42","0","0"

Is it the poorly designed combat system, where the main difficulty is enemies having inflated damage and hp scores?\n\nBethesda was never particularly good at designing intersting quests since Oblivion, and this shows in FO4, where many quests are simply, go here, kill that thing, or go here, talk to that person, repeat, with no potential for an alternate solution. The situations in which you can solve a quest by talking instead of fighting are few and far between. The speech system is tied purely to the charisma stat, and it's back to being chance based like in Fallout 3.\n\nThe characters are the best Bethesda has ever made, which doesn't say much. The companions, while some of them are interesting, are still only as developed as an early Bioware character. Non companions are as paper thin as ever, and I found myself barely caring for most of the major characters.\n\nThe voiced main character and simplified dialogue system causes a less roleplayable experience, as your character already has an established background. There's not much choice when it comes to being a nice or mean character, and how you act during a quest usually doesn't change much.\n\nEven siding with the "evil" faction doesn't seem particularly mean, as most of the factions in the game are written with such a gray morality that it almost seems like none of them are a good choice for the game world.\n\nOf course, the game is full of bugs, running what is basically a modified version of the engine from Fallout 3, on the verge of colapsing from it's own unoptimized weight. The game is also not designed well for the PC, as the interface for many things was clearly made with consoles in mind.\n\nThis isn't even getting into many of the little problems I have with the design in this game, but overall, Fallout 4 seems like a blatantly unpolished experience by a large developer. If Bethesda is expecting the modding community to fix all their problems for them, this should come as an insult, as they don't care to provide a optimal gaming experience right out of the box.\n\nIt's a shame there's no other game quite like this, but in it's current state, Fallout 4 is nowhere near worth the 60$ asking price.","November 24, 2015","false","170.7"," 194 of 362 people (54%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","54","194","362","8","0"

This review does not look at mods, and looks at the base game as a final product minus DLC (which it should be). This doesn't include bugs/glitches. As you can see i've only spent 17 hours in game, but personally i believe that's enough time to narrow down the following likes/dislikes i have about it. Below is a short summary/overview, followed by a more in-depth analysis for those that wish too understand my reasoning better.\n\nGood Points:\n- Combat (Much better than previous Fallout titles)\n- Stability and Constant fps above 60\n- Everything in the world has a use. Nothing is junk.\n- Brotherhood of Steel morale compass (I like this, it changes our perspective from F3).\n\nNeutral (These were points i felt indifferent about)\n\n- Musical Score/Radio\n- World Size/Map\n- Enemy Variation\n- Settlement Building\n- Factions\n- Companions\n- Advertisment of the game (What they show in trailers, is basically what you get graphics wise)\n\nNegative Points\n\n- Not an RPG like i'd hoped (Limited dialogue options, most of which change nothing)\n- Main Quest can be finished in several hours and lacks any depth.\n- ALOT of npcs can't be killed (An option for this would have been nice)\n- No hardcore mode (Or anything survivabilty wise) like in New Vegas\n- Unengaging and Uninteresting World. Fees like a reskinned Fallout 3\n- Lack of Weapon Variation (You have 1 assault rifle, 2 pistols etc)\n- Graphics (though this is a minor issue for myself, as they advertised it as being rather crap. I knew what i was in for)\n- No options in-game for brightness/gamma/contrast (Even Skyrim had brightness)\n- The inability to roleplay as a character you want. (You'll always be that Ex-Soldier/Lawyer person looking for their child)\n- The ending\n- Skills are gone\n- Conversational skills in-game are barely reflected by your perks.

Get ready for a shock and a disappointment.\n\nI honestly loved Fallout 3 and New Vegas. And I expected Fallout 4 to be even better than those two.\nSadly. That's not the case.\n\nI'll keep it simple and short.\n\nPros:\nGood soundtrack. Recycled here and there, but nice to listen to.\nCrafting system: Very nice. Had lots of fun playing with it. Aluminium will forever be in my nightmares.\nCombat: rather enjoyable. VATS is still there to help, power armor crafting makes it interesting especially after playing with the modifications.\nSome really good plot moments which actually made my jaw drop\n\nCons:\nDialog system. From the incredibly complex system of older fallouts reduced to a very.... Very... Pathetic form. Not much to chose from and most importantly. I REALLY would love to know what I am saying instead of "sarcastic" since many times the answers were not sarcastic at all. Perks do not affect the conversation aside of charisma for presuadion checks. Maxing intelligence had no effect. You still could chose the dumb option as well as the nuclear physicist option.\n\nWhile many people don't like it how early you get the power armor. I didn't mind that. What I do mind is the actual lack of options to play with not to mention that some of the modifications tend to break some quests. What is the point of  the whole thing if I have to keep it in my inventory for quests without equipping it.\n\nLoot. Legendary weapons are a joke. Some of them are bought and some of them are dropped by legendary enemies. Of course depending on difficulty. But the RNG is really frustrating.\n\nQuests: Kill or fetch. Got old after a while.\n\nEndings. I feel as if the endings are just the same thing slightly altered. I expected more.... Choices. Extremination ending? ok. But how about a peaceful one? How about alternative solutions. All revolved around: kill everyone. Why? Some really laughable reason? Didn't really matter what you said.\n\nCompanions: The only memorable ones for me were Curie and Valentine. Yes they had unique dialouges, but that's all. Nothing else. In F3 if you had a specific companion you could avoid some problems with BoS. Here? Nope.\n\n\nFinally. If you are new to fallout games. Sure, F4 is very enjoyable. But if you played the older ones, you might as well replay them :D So it boils down to your expectations. If you don't expect anything. Go for it. Well worth the price. If you expect a game like the previous fallout titles...

The gunplay is satisfying, the weapon/armor modding is nice, and the power armor now feels properly like a walking tank. Each of these improvements comes with a caveat, however, and there are several negatives to offset the positives.\n\nThe RPG elements are basically gone- every character will follow the same general progression path, because perks/perk ranks are limited to level, meaning you'll be spending a lot of time spending your perk points on things you don't care about before you can, say, take the extra rank in hacking so you can hack the expert terminal guarding that cool loot you found that one time. Dialogue is insanely limited, and due to the dialogue wheel system you will occasionally end up meaning to calmly ask someone a question, and instead end up flying into a fit of rage and demanding answers- because writing! Skill- and perk-based dialogue choices are replaced entirely by a "persuasion" system, of which the success chance is always tied to your CHA skill (modified by the like two dialogue-based perks)-- So if you're trying to intimidate that streetrat out of trying to extort you for protection money, your STR doesn't matter, your weapon skills don't matter- nah, you gotta be a smooooooth talker. Also, Bethesda has implemented a "legendary" spawn system, akin to the way Borderlands would spawn "badass" versions of enemies on occasion. Legendary enemies have double health, usually have some sort of status effect they inflict, and due insane amounts of damage- but they drop "legendary" loot! Which is absolute trash 99% of the time. THANKS FOR THAT POOL CUE THAT DOES EXTRA LIMB DAMAGE, GUYS! Weapon variety is extremely limited, as well, with a pretty straight line progression in terms of firearms (and, so far as I can tell, only three or four laser/plasma weapons)\n\nAs for the caveats to the positives: Gunplay is nice, but because of the way Bethesda feels difficulty progression should work, every enemy at your level or above will end up being an insane bullet sponge unless you use your absolute most damaging weapon- which is going to be a pain in the ♥♥♥ because finding ammunition that isn't .38 (the ammunition pipe rifles, the weapon of choice for random raiders) is going to be an ordeal. The modding system is neat, but extremely tedious- you'll never have enough adhesive (and you can only fabricate your own if you've had the good fortune to find specific types of plants to farm in settlements you control), and only certain types of armor can be modded- I've yet to find a single piece of headwear that can be modified. Power armor is nice, but they give it to you ENTIRELY too early and balance it with a somewhat tedious fuel system, and because FO4 uses Damage Resistance as opposed to Damage Threshold, you'll still be taking damage through your pristine super duper power armor.\n\nDo you want a looty shooty game set loosely in the fallout universe? Play FO4. Do you want an RPG with meaningful choices (be it gameplay-wise or story-wise), a need to specialize your character, and the ability to deal with situations in a way that isn't just shooting every living thing in sight? I'd pass on this one, at least until the modding community develops and potentially fixes some of the tripups bethesda made.\n","November 14, 2015","true","75.5"," 101 of 186 people (54%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","54","101","186","9","0"

If you like to goof around and blow things up, Fallout's wasteland offers plenty of things to do, see, and shoot. You'll have a blast.\nBut if you're more into serious apocalypse survival with deep and meaningful quests, you'll find Fallout 4 to be lacking. The Survival Mode DLC is essential for players seeking a genuine apocalypse challenge. Unfortunately, there's no mod or DLC that can rectify the boring quests. About half of the quests I've undertaken fall along the lines of, "there's a gang of raiders at location X and they've been harassing us. Go kill them". That's it. You don't even get to ask how much you'll get paid in dialogue. This strikes me as lazy quest writing on behalf of the developers, especially when compared to the brilliance of the Witcher 3's quests.","May 29","false","22.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The dialogue system is downright terrible, there are no S.P.E.C.I.A.L checks and because they removed skills there aren't any skill checks, the only kind of check you get is a "speech" check only yeilding slightly more caps then what you would normally get. 99% of your choices don't matter, the only choice that matters is what faction to join, and that only affects the ending. There is no karma system, and you CANNOT be evil, no matter what. You can't choose how you act, you HAVE to be the concerned parent looking for their child. There's also no repuation system so you cannot track how certain groups feel about you. Also weapon and armour decay is gone, the only items that get damaged are pieces of power armour. Companions are boring, they have a set few actions that will increase their opinion of you. Piper for example can be romanced so easily, all you have to do is pick seven and a half thousand unowned locks, and she'll just open her ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ legs for you. You don't have to do anything like complete certain quests with them. Most companions follow the basis of: You did X task Y times, have a segment of my depressing backstory about Z. Also you can only have one companion at a time, a downgrade from New Vegas' two at any one time. Also they don't care what you do. After the main quest, Piper was angry with me because I chose the Institue, after that one bit of dialouge she didn't care, nor did she bring it up again. It's as if I never chose that ending. New Vegas, made it so that if you had a compainion, such as Boone and if you then joined Caesar's Legion or gained a negative Repuation with the NCR, he would leave your service, until you improve your repuation, in terms of the NCR, or if you joined the Legion, he won't want to travel with you.\n\nYou'd think after New Vegas Bethesda would take notes from what it did well, such as repuation. BUT NOPE! All of the good things New Vegas added after Fallout 3 is gone completely out the window.\n\nFallout 4 does some good things though, the new power armour system is great and this is how it should've been done before, compared to the previous games power armour feels a lot more bulky and tank-like, as the lore makes it out to be. Weapon mods are nice and add some variety. Junk items like wonderglue, duct tape etc. now have uses, instead of being just clutter.\n\n*EDIT 04/06/2016*\nUsing mods now flags your save file as modded and disables achievements. Bethesda's been pushing for mods on consoles, and now they disable achievements or trophies, as they're called on PlayStation. What the actual ♥♥♥♥? Previous games such as Skyrim, Fallout 3, etc. didn't do this. You're telling me that using mods to add extra content is akin to cheating, but opening the console and spawning in items, completing quests etc. isn't?? The previous games, such as New Vegas, disable achievements in that session even if you open the console and immeadiately close it. What the hell were they thinking? Mods are the bread and butter of this game.\n\nTo sum it up:\nPros\n+More fallout\n+Power armour\n+Weapon mods\n+Looks nice\n\nCons\n-Dialogue system\n-Weak RPG elements\n-Very little choices that don't matter\n-Many bugs and glitches, even for bethesda. NPCS such as Preston floating through roofs of houses and staying on the roofs where I can't talk to him to turn in quests. Ghouls turning into area rugs upon death, ruining the scenery.\n-Compainions are boring and don't care about your actions. The worst you'll get is: a "____ Hated that" prompt. Ooooohhhhhhh scary!\n-Mods disable achievements, making players who are trying to get all of them not use mods. Why bother bringing mods to consoles then?\n\nAnd finally the dealbreaker, for me at least is this:\nFallout 3 was released in October 28, 2008\nFallout: New Vegas was released in October 19, 2010.\nFallout 4 was released in November 10, 2015\nFallout: New Vegas took under 2 years to develop and it\'s better than Fallout 4 that took 7 YEARS to develop and yes I know they were busy working on Skyrim during 3 of those 7 years but that is the biggest reason why I cannot recommend this game, not at full price. Save your money, pick up the Ultimate Edition of Fallout: New Vegas it costs half as much as Fallout 4 and with enough mods you can make it look better than Fallout 4.

OK there's now a splash more colour, and a few isolated attempts at writing an interesting quest but it's largely a matter of traipsing around, locating a derelict bolthole of psychopaths/mutants/weird cyborgs, killing everything in sight with very little forethought and looting a staggering array of pointless tat. Only now you can, if you are able to circumnavigate the entirely useless UI and don't lose the will to live first, use said pointless tat to craft needlessly complex upgrades to your weapons/armour and/or unappealing hovels and shops for your charming post-apocalyptic community. A community filled with dull companions who you can assign to pick radioactive vegetables and pump radioactive water. A few of them might even attempt to bond with you, but you really won't care about any of them, so you'll return once again to the wilderness outside, find another derelict bolthole, rinse and repeat.\n\nWhilst engaged in this most Sisyphean of tasks, a faint recollection may occasionally flicker at the back of your mind - wasn't there supposed to be some overrarching purpose for me working my way through all this tedium? Ah oh yes, my missing infant son, stolen from the arms of my murdered spouse. You'd have thought this would be a motive that would invest the game's narrative with some scrap of meaning, but no. It, like everything else, it contrives at the hands of Fallout 4's creators to be so dull as to be instantly forgettable.\n\nI struggle to understand why a studio with the resources available to Bethesda is apparently unable to employ any decent writers, whereas a relative upstart from Eastern Europe (CDPR) contrives to write quests that actually moved me in much the same way as a finely crafted episode of Game of Thrones.\n\nAnd the graphics are still nowhere near good enough either.\n\nAll in all a massive disappointment.","February 2","false","16.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

I sprung for the season pass up front without hesitation. but there's just no getting around it... Fallout 4 is a tremendous disapointment. What you have here is a very pretty open world exploration game with improved gunplay at the cost of virtually no depth or replayability. Everything seems half-♥♥♥♥♥ or incomplete. Every conversation tree is essentially irrelevant, with conversation choices almost always leading to the same result no matter what you choose. Locations that look like they were intended to be interactive or story elements go unutilized. They develop this heavy base-building mini game that leads nowhere but to the occasional mission of "kill X ghouls/raiders/mutants at Y location." Character progression doesn't matter as you have infinite levels with which to earn whatever perk you need. There are no hard choices beyond deciding which faction you're going to side with to determine which endgame cinematic you'll get (Mass Effect 3 anyone?). All I am left with is the hope that the DLC will somehow rescue this clunker.","February 5","false","253.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

That's such a good idea Bethesda.\n\nBut for real, this game was hyped so much and yet it was kind of a dissapointment. On console, I have over 1000 hours on both Fallout 3 and Fallout New Vegas combined. And yet, with Fallout 4, I could not play anymore past my 113 hours.\n\nFallout 4 was made to cater everyone. And I mean everyone, from the casual players to the more serious players... Or so they thought. In catering to the casual players, they lost the "seriousness" of the Fallout franchise. I remember, in Fallout 1, you could kill anyone and just completely mess up the quests for those characters. I was hoping for Fallout 4 to have something similar to this.\n\nLook, Fallout 4 is a good game, but it lacks any actual RPG elements. The story is pretty linear. It's also a bit predictable. Fallout 4 is fun during my first 80 hours, but after completing the game, I lost all will to keep on playing. Fallout New Vegas had so many things that Fallout 4 could have improved on, but Bethesda this not do this. They tried to cater to all kinds of players and made Fallout 4 a game where you don't have to think of your consenquences. So many good things could have come out in this game. A good example is a place called the "Battleground" or something like that. This place was such a dissapointment, I thought that I was gonna be able to fight in the ring and earn caps and do side quests for the owner of the place, but instead I go inside and have to kill everyone. Another place would be the place where the robots run in the rally. I thought I was gonna be able to bet on a robot and earn caps and interact with the people there. But nope, I go close and they start to shoot at me.\n\nThis game isn't what it was hyped up to be. I am not saying you shouldn't buy this game, but if you are a hardcore RPG fan than this is not the game for you. Fallout 4 does not have the same RPG elements as the older Fallouts.\n\nI really want to recommend this game, but I cannot. I have lost almost all interest in the game and I hope that the modders will fix the game to the point where everyone can play.\n\n","February 5","false","117.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","1"

Only reason I choose thumbs down is because I simply don't think it's a very good Fallout game... I don't actually think it's a good open world Bethesda game in general, but still reasonably a bit above mediocre game.\n\n*Mainly ramblings of a mad man*\nI managed to get some entertainment out of the game, more than 90% of that was from the combat. That being said, the combat still isn't good enough to warrant scrapping so many other mechanics over. It is probably the best combat system Bethesda has managed to put into one of their games, but I still feel that compared to other shooters it's perhaps just a bit above average at best.\nFrankly the combat in Fallout 3 and New Vegas were passable, though it should be noted that a lot of gameplay improvements in Fallout 4 were mods in New Vegas; the main things I enjoyed, especially in New Vegas, was the dialogue system, quests, and world design or variety. A lot of comparisons with New Vegas are probably unfair since it's a different studio I suppose, just unfortunate than instead of taking hints from the improvements that game made they mostly went their own way and scrapped almost everything the game did.\n\nI will say that their last game, Skyrim, was a bit of a shallow game... But I still managed to enjoy the majority of it. Skyrim at had some locations that typically ended up being more than shooting galleries that the majority of locations in Fallout 4 are. There are some locations of interest that aren't shooting galleries, but very few. If Skyrim is considered a shallow lake, then I would consider Fallout 4 being a desert where a lake used to be.\n\nThe main problem with Fallout 4 specifically I would say is the incredible lack of core RPG elements and choice. The dialogue itself is very limited and frankly speaks for itself on how awful it is.\n\nThe game also lacks skill checks and dialogue checks, mostly anyways. There is only one single instance that the game uses a skill check anywhere in the game, then it is never used again. That being the USS Constitution quest to skip 2 item fetch missions. Besides that, the speech perk isn't vary useful 80% of the time it is available... Many times it only gives vague information, more money, or sometimes passing it does literally nothing other than giving you extra XP and the exact same dialogue you would get by simply saying "yes". The other 20% of the time it does sometimes maybe provide very minor changes, also idiotic for them to have a speech check you can pass still be seen in red which makes someone think they can't pass it yet.\n\nThen there is the matter of choice... I believe the quest with the Chinese Submarine Yangtz summarizes the entire game on lacking choice. With this quest you do some killing ghouls and fetching an item on the other side of the map... Now the game explicitly tells you to NOT put the items you gathered in the wrong order or the submarine explodes... Putting the items in the wrong way initiates an in-game cutscene that kills you and reloads your save, nothing else. The game more or less gave you a false choice for literally no reason whatsoever and I believe that to be infuriating.\n\nThe game also has just a horrid amount of repeat quests that are designed mainly to waste your time or grind XP off of to the point that I believe close to half of the quest in Fallout 4 are these style of quests. It wouldn't be that bad if there were only a few; Skyrim did have quests like these, but didn't quite shove them down your throat like Preston does whenever you go near him...\nSome of the repeat quests seem like they were tossed in the bin, but dragged back out to make more content out of. An example being that they actually made a repeat quest that involves you going to settlements that you likely own and passing a speech check to haggle stuff off them... You then go back to the dude and mission complete... Then you can do it again to go do more speech checks... It's rather terrible.","February 10","false","157.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

It's not that it's a bad game, it was fun, I did play 130 hours. but it wasn't what I was expecting. I liked, the branching story paths, unpredictability and the ability to solve problems without violence, that the previous games had. None of which are found in this one. While the new weapon mods system is great, as Is the new power armor system, everything else falls short. And a lot of things made no sense. After a battle fought in power armor parts had to be fixed since a grenade fell nearby. Understandable, but if you fight the same battle in raider armor made from junk you never need to fix it. Weapons also never break, weaken or jam, even those made from plumbing supplies and driftwood. Which oddly enough describes half the guns in this game. The build system lacks physics making it possible to build bases that hover in the air. And they have a crippling parts count limit that seems pretty arbitrary.\n\nThe game is small both in size and density. There are 3 towns with voiced characters. everywhere else is populated by raiders. Skyrim had 9 believably large cities and several more towns. all with voiced characters and many side quests New Vegas had at least 7. Even fallout 3 had 4 such locations. Most fallout 4 side quests use repetitive dialogue, especially the minutemen ones. And nearly all consist of Nothing more than, going somewhere and killing or fetching something. gone too is the humor these quests brought in previous titles.\n\nthe story relies on a series of twilight zone style twists. Which of course are no fun the next time. Dialogue options are limited and you don't actually know what your own character is going to say. Perks have no effect on dialogue at all and neither does the special.\n\nThe background given to your character if they are male is that there a war veteran, while if your female you're a lawyer, and yet the story progresses exactly the same. Despite most of it involving killing people. Come on since she is voiced and a Lawyer; I expected her to be a little upset after killing somebody the first time, but... nope. She didn't even react to facing a Deathclaw, which also happens in the first 20 min. Why they didn't Just have whoever YOU choose be the ex soldier, I don't know, It would have made more sense. Especially since you get your first power armor within the first 20 minutes, and know how to work it, something a lawyer turned housewife should not know how to do.\n\nThe largest gripe of all I had is in nearly every quest nothing you do matters. You can talk somebody out of killing a person, only to have their partner do it anyway, with the dialogue after being identical. No choice you make in a quest has any repercussions later. In fact there is no karma system, or even a bounty system like Skyrim. You can walk into town, kill 5 guards come back a few days later and they're back to cracking jokes about your armor. In general the game doesn't really let you be evil, no mater how many people you kill or what quest options you choose, folks will treat you as their savior. No hidden faction or missions are revealed for your misdeeds, unlike the previous fallout's or Skyrim.\n\nUnlike New Vegas, you can't broker alliances between factions. Worst of all No matter who you side with, you get the same end missions. Many of which share animations, scenes and objectives. followed by the same monologue and montage after. Despite having radically different agendas all factions resort to the same exact methods. Making every choice you thought you made meaningless. Which is why I agree with many others in saying that this Is an FPS game. Not even a particularly good one.","February 18","false","138.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

If you like to goof around and blow things up, Fallout's wasteland offers plenty of things to do, see, and shoot. You'll have a blast.\nBut if you're more into serious apocalypse survival with deep and meaningful quests, you'll find Fallout 4 to be lacking. The Survival Mode DLC is essential for players seeking a genuine apocalypse challenge. Unfortunately, there's no mod or DLC that can rectify the boring quests. About half of the quests I've undertaken fall along the lines of, "there's a gang of raiders at location X and they've been harassing us. Go kill them". That's it. You don't even get to ask how much you'll get paid in dialogue. This strikes me as lazy quest writing on behalf of the developers, especially when compared to the brilliance of the Witcher 3's quests.","May 29","false","22.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The dialogue system is downright terrible, there are no S.P.E.C.I.A.L checks and because they removed skills there aren't any skill checks, the only kind of check you get is a "speech" check only yeilding slightly more caps then what you would normally get. 99% of your choices don't matter, the only choice that matters is what faction to join, and that only affects the ending. There is no karma system, and you CANNOT be evil, no matter what. You can't choose how you act, you HAVE to be the concerned parent looking for their child. There's also no repuation system so you cannot track how certain groups feel about you. Also weapon and armour decay is gone, the only items that get damaged are pieces of power armour. Companions are boring, they have a set few actions that will increase their opinion of you. Piper for example can be romanced so easily, all you have to do is pick seven and a half thousand unowned locks, and she'll just open her ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ legs for you. You don't have to do anything like complete certain quests with them. Most companions follow the basis of: You did X task Y times, have a segment of my depressing backstory about Z. Also you can only have one companion at a time, a downgrade from New Vegas' two at any one time. Also they don't care what you do. After the main quest, Piper was angry with me because I chose the Institue, after that one bit of dialouge she didn't care, nor did she bring it up again. It's as if I never chose that ending. New Vegas, made it so that if you had a compainion, such as Boone and if you then joined Caesar's Legion or gained a negative Repuation with the NCR, he would leave your service, until you improve your repuation, in terms of the NCR, or if you joined the Legion, he won't want to travel with you.\n\nYou'd think after New Vegas Bethesda would take notes from what it did well, such as repuation. BUT NOPE! All of the good things New Vegas added after Fallout 3 is gone completely out the window.\n\nFallout 4 does some good things though, the new power armour system is great and this is how it should've been done before, compared to the previous games power armour feels a lot more bulky and tank-like, as the lore makes it out to be. Weapon mods are nice and add some variety. Junk items like wonderglue, duct tape etc. now have uses, instead of being just clutter.\n\n*EDIT 04/06/2016*\nUsing mods now flags your save file as modded and disables achievements. Bethesda's been pushing for mods on consoles, and now they disable achievements or trophies, as they're called on PlayStation. What the actual ♥♥♥♥? Previous games such as Skyrim, Fallout 3, etc. didn't do this. You're telling me that using mods to add extra content is akin to cheating, but opening the console and spawning in items, completing quests etc. isn't?? The previous games, such as New Vegas, disable achievements in that session even if you open the console and immeadiately close it. What the hell were they thinking? Mods are the bread and butter of this game.\n\nTo sum it up:\nPros\n+More fallout\n+Power armour\n+Weapon mods\n+Looks nice\n\nCons\n-Dialogue system\n-Weak RPG elements\n-Very little choices that don't matter\n-Many bugs and glitches, even for bethesda. NPCS such as Preston floating through roofs of houses and staying on the roofs where I can't talk to him to turn in quests. Ghouls turning into area rugs upon death, ruining the scenery.\n-Compainions are boring and don't care about your actions. The worst you'll get is: a "____ Hated that" prompt. Ooooohhhhhhh scary!\n-Mods disable achievements, making players who are trying to get all of them not use mods. Why bother bringing mods to consoles then?\n\nAnd finally the dealbreaker, for me at least is this:\nFallout 3 was released in October 28, 2008\nFallout: New Vegas was released in October 19, 2010.\nFallout 4 was released in November 10, 2015\nFallout: New Vegas took under 2 years to develop and it\'s better than Fallout 4 that took 7 YEARS to develop and yes I know they were busy working on Skyrim during 3 of those 7 years but that is the biggest reason why I cannot recommend this game, not at full price. Save your money, pick up the Ultimate Edition of Fallout: New Vegas it costs half as much as Fallout 4 and with enough mods you can make it look better than Fallout 4.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/377160/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","“War never changes” runs the tagline for Fallout 4, and though that's a dour descriptor for this sometimes bleakly hilarious game, it's also sort of true that the Fallout series hasn't really changed. However, that's because of another important saying: “If it ain't broke, don't fix it.” Short of changing the setting to the Boston area, circa 2277, Bethesda Game Studios simply hasn't had to tinker with much since 2010's near-perfect Fallout: New Vegas.\n\nThe big, new, questionable improvement is basically the inclusion of a built-in mod kit, which allows players to fix up their liberated settlements. As it turns out, it's a bit more onerous to construct things on a 3D plane, as opposed to the 2D plane of the game's mobile prequel, Fallout Shelter. It's also largely unnecessary to waste skill points on perks like Gun Nut that allow for deeper customization on one's arsenal, given that every slain foe drops everything they're wearing. Then again, this only enhances the realism of the game, both in terms of the cobbled-together post-apocalyptic aesthetic and in the freedom given to those who want to play through on their own terms.\n\nBut Fallout 4 is far more than an expansion. Without spoiling too much, the plot introduces a new creature beyond the standard irradiated monsters like the bearish Yao Guai and self-descriptive Bloatflies and Feral Ghouls. These new foes or potentially friends are Synths, robots that are all but indistinguishable from humans. It's Blade Runner in all the right ways, and most of the moral, story-altering dilemmas presented this go-around revolve around which of the various factions players choose to support, from those in the Railroad who want to set the enslaved Synths free, to the familiar faces of the Brotherhood of Steel, who want to destroy that dangerous technology.\n\nThe core of Fallout 4's journey centers on your character and his or her quest to find the truth about what happened in Vault 111. Though the last two Fallout games put you smack in the center of an involved narrative, it never felt as personal or invested as Fallout 4's story. That's largely due to Fallout 4's committal to giving the player character voiced dialogue. The typical silent protagonist is gone, and Bethesda's taken a bit of a Bioware approach to giving the player a meaningful connection to the in-game avatar. Your story will play out with dialogue choices you selected, and just by having an actor there to give some inflection to the words, Bethesda is able to make you more connected to this persona than ever before.\n\nWhile conversational choice has been a part of the Fallout series, talking it out with computer characters face-to-face was always a bit disjointed. It never felt natural. With Fallout 4, there's a more cinematic approach to conversations. The camera always pulls out to find a more appealing angle to show the different sides of a conversation. There's a large emphasis on making your character more a part of this world by showing him or her from outside the default first-person perspective, and it makes a great deal of difference in connecting you to this person, this world and the conversations you'll have.\n\nConversations are equally as important to fleshing out your relationship with the numerous companions you'll meet on your adventure. Unlike previous entries in the series, these characters actually feel like companions. Whether it's Dogmeat, Piper, Codsworth, or any of the others you'll encounter and befriend, there's more to having these people around than just serving as another gun in battle or a walking storage unit. The longer you hang out with a single companion, the more your relationship with that person will grow. Characters will talk with you while on quests, and your decisions, no matter how minor, will impact how they perceive you.\n\nComplements to the so-called main campaign aside, the majority of a player's time in Fallout 4 is spent wandering around the Commonwealth, especially now that Bethesda has removed the level cap, and it's the setting that ultimately needs to hold up as a central character. Those who were skeptical that Boston—a less immediately familiar setting than Washington D.C. or Las Vegas—can rest easy that the Commonwealth is well represented.\n\nFenway Park, has been repurposed and turned into Diamond City, walking the historic Freedom Trail plays a pivotal role, the Salem Museum of Witchcraft is open for business, and there's a new batch of Minutemen out to beat the drums of revolution, or at least protect citizens from the Raiders and Super Mutants attempting to divvy up landmarks like Faneuil Hall, Bunker Hill, and Walden's Pond. And while it's nice to have coastal options available for exploration, like the floating, anarchic raft city of Libertalia, Fallout 4 is filled with other unique environments, such as the Glowing Wastes and the airship Prydwen.\n\nAdmittedly, while the various vaults, hospitals, military bases, and libraries all start to bleed together given enough time, the sideplots that send you there are filled with more than enough variety to pick up the slack, whether that means facing off against a serial killer who's festooned an art gallery with his bloody paintings and skeletal sculptures, or exposing Vault-Tec's nefarious experimentation by finding sub-vaults hidden within the main ones. The first-person shooting also grows stale after several dozen hours, but as with Borderlands and Destiny, the constant acquisition of new weapons and perks at least provides a sense of achievement for all that marksmanship.\n\nThere are multiple suits you can find scattered throughout the Boston area, all in various states of disrepair. Scavenging parts from these, or those you find on raiders encountered in the wild, to craft a single, solid suit of armor is a key component of becoming a force to be reckoned with in the wastes. You can even customize the armor a bit, adding extra reinforcement to ensure you've got the most protection you can get.\n\nThe VATS mechanic returns, but only slows down time instead of pausing it. I found this change heightened the risk of any encounter and made VATS much more of a last resort instead of a “go to for critical hits” solution it had been in previous games. It also made me use it less as a result, but thankfully the first person mechanics are probably the best Bethesda has produced in its RPGs.\n\nVisually, Fallout 4 is a rather impressive game and has some insane attention to detail. From the very first time you set foot into the world of this post apocalyptic game, you feel like you’re on another world and whether that’s the 1950’s inspired post-game introduction or walking out of the bunker for the first time, BGS have really hit the mark when it comes to the atmosphere. So no matter where you look like the ground, the sky or as you enter a plethora of different buildings, it’s definitely a labour of love and really immerses you into not just the character but the world itself.\n\nThe game's music is perfectly set for the different situations you find yourself in. It's suitably dramatic in the big fight scenes and similarly soft when you get to a more emotional part. Whilst not at the forefront of your attention, the music is always there and sometimes you won't even notice it until it goes silent. Your heart might be in your mouth as you hack a computer or lockpick a door with enemies nearby, and the music will do a great job to reflect exactly how you are feeling.\n\nThe best thing about Fallout 4 is the freedom that it gives you, not only with what to do and where to go, but also how quests will turn out. Will you talk your way out of a certain quest or run in all guns blazing? The choice is yours. Overall, the game is pretty close to perfect, and if you decide to pass on exploring the vast wasteland, then you only have yourself to blame. The hype is real, and you won't be disappointed.","May 12","true","101.1"," 112 of 207 people (54%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","54","112","207","5","7"

But now i just feel i have to say something to you all. I am not the type of guy that leaves bad comments if he thinks so but i really have to tell you this.\n\nFallout 4 became such a really sad game, and this makes me sad as well. I don't play videgames that much anymore, until a couple of years ago i was playing a lot, but now the only game with which i spend money on is Fallout, because i always thought was a great game. WAS indeed.\n\nSPOILER ALERT HERE!\n\nLet's start with the story. It was so obvious that the vault dweller was going to go under a cryogenic state, when you annouced the game i said the same thing. That's fair enough i would say, it is a cool idea for a vault, and i was not surprised that vault tech was able to do something like that. The problem is with Shaun. As soon as i saw Kellog kidnapping him i was sure he was going to be the head of the institute. C'mon guys you are way better than that. When the player finally manages to step into the institute you CAN'T make shaun the boss of it. IT IS SUCH AN OBVIUOS CHOICE. I did not surprised me at all, it destroyed all my espectations and it made me feel like "Uh all this noise to get there just to find out that this kid is the head of the evil ones and he acts like a jerk", so boring.\n\nThen the factions.\nFirst of all the minute men, they should have deserved way more importance and quests than the other factions, because they are the good ones! C'mon people what are you thinking about? The railroads were so stupid and pointless and you made them look so cool and great while they were so useless. But no you had to make Preston such an empty and stupid character that just tells you that there is another settlement that needs help.. Who should really destroy the institute? The selfish BOS which will keep their technology? Or the stupid rail road that wants to save just the synths? I know, the player can destroy the institute with the minutemen but at the end, they are still a bunch of losers that can barely stay together. Which is ok at the beginning but they could have grown way more and become a great faction.\nAlso, why there is no way to keep all the faction alive and create a sort of deal between them? I thought talking was one of the main weapons that your character could use..\n\nThe karma component just went away.. the only people you should care about are the companions that will judge you. Guys i remeber three dog saying that i was a piece of garbage cause i did so many wrong things and people would fear or love me around the world. Every little choice would make a change in the game experience, every single choice. In fallout 4 you can't say no to stuff, there are just rude or polite ways of saying yes. This is stupid guys, so stupid.\n\nThe settlements idea looked cool in the beginning, but then it became a pain in the ♥♥♥. So many stupid settlements, do you think i am playing the sims and i want to spend my time building ♥♥♥♥ that doesen't even snap togheter properly? Really? It would have been nice if you made like 5 big settlements, with their own story and missions and things to DISCOVER, because that's what fallout is, not stupid small useless settlements without personality in a large number, that you can armor them with the biggest guns and they will always cry and get their ♥♥♥ kicked.\n\nSo far the DLCs are horrible. I was not going to buy the season pass but i tried and Automatron is such a joke. Do you wanna compare it with the other dlc that YOU produced? I was so excited to face the mechanicist and it took me 30 mins to finish the dlc. What i had at the end? I weak story, with a weak enemy. And who needs robots? Why you made it the main thing? It's useless, it is just like the settlements, people will lose 5 minutes building robots and thats it.. You could have used this feature way better and not only, go there kill robots take the radar find the mechanicist stop her done. I remeber going to the Pit, to point lookout, and know the charcaters and the area, this girl was such an empty character she did not give me anything. You made us control a ♥♥♥♥ing army of robots in New Vegas and now you give us this empty robot dlc? Cmon! Some of the new weapons were cool tho.\n\nI will keep playing this just for the mods, so be thankful to your community.\n\nI think you owe us an apology guys, i am really disappontied\n\nPS : I want to know what's the point of giving to the player a power armor and let him kill a deatclaw like it was a molerat in the very first mission? Like that they lost all their scary factor...\n\nPPS : Fallout shelter was such a boring game.\n\nBe ashemed guys..\n\nGoodbye","April 3","false","41.5"," 17 of 27 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","17","27","2","5"

I played through it twice, and after that, I can say that this doesn’t feel like a true Fallout game.First, the good:\nThe Pip-Boy is amazing. It’s fully featured and can play games, which is great. If nothing else, this was done right.\nPower armor actually feels like more than just armor. The clunkiness makes it not so good for stealth and/or tight corridors, which it isn't supposed to be. Also, the addition of using fusion cores to power the suit helps to add a small element of concern when deploying it (although, late game it feels like fusion cores start raining from the sky.)\nMagazines grant perks instead of just skills. It's nice considering that in FO:NV and FO3 I would often have a skill maxed and still be finding books for it, making them effectively useless.\nV.A.T.S. opted for slow motion targeting, rather than pausing the game completely, and it seems to be less buggy than it was in FO3/FO:NV.\nCharisma checks have been reverted to being chance (with higher charisma level increasing the likelihood of success) rather than requiring a specific level for the skill check to succeed. This actually works better, and makes characters seem a bit more realistic. You might be more willing to listen to an idiot on one day over another.\nThe character creator is decent, although I would like to have more hair/eye colors than the ones on the natural human spectrum. That would have been a good place to leave the sliders in.\nWeather is a built-in thing now, which is nice.Now, the bad:\nI'll just say it: the story is terrible. Linear, unintriguing, very little originality, and it fails to immerse and provide a purpose for playing through the main story. I know it's not easy to explain someone living for two hundred years, but why would we go with the most generic science-fiction explanation and say cryo-pods? Also, what’s Bethesda’s fetish with saving missing family members?\nThe voiced player character thing on a whole was a bad idea, and that can be said for almost any RPG where character creation is possible. When I play through a game like Fallout, I want to hear my character talk in my own voice. If I can't feel like I'm becoming the character I'm playing as, then it can't really be called a Role Playing Game.\nThe dialogue options are extremely limited. It's only four options, and they all basically lead to the same outcome. This kind of goes back to my last point about a voiced PC being a bad idea, because it really limits what the player can say in terms of dialogue. It isn't cost effective to have a voice actor (or two, in this case) record more than four lines per selection, in addition to all the in-between things the PC says.\nThe way the "plot" (and I use that term loosely) unfolds, it feels as if the game forces you to travel with a companion. What I find annoying is how you actually need the dog for one of the quests in the main story line. On top of this, I found that I was constantly being introduced to people who desperately wanted to travel with me. There’s the dog, then Piper, then Nick, and then the ones you get from siding with the BOS or railroad.\nAlso, while I'm on the subject of companions, why is it that you can only have one at a time? FO:NV allowed for two without mods. One human and one non-human. FO4 makes it impossible to have your own posse, if that’s what you want.\nThe perk system is weak. Several of the perks are just access to crafting items, a few are for combat, and some are just incredibly stupid, like Aquaboy/girl (from the get-go, you can gain the ability to breathe underwater and not take any radiation damage from swimming). Oh, and did you accidentally scrap the only power armor station at the settlement you were using for your house? Well, if you want it back, then you have to take BOTH ranks of the local leader perk. That effectively screws over anyone running a low charisma build (it requires 6), and puts a level lock (14) on being able to build workstations at your settlements, not to mention having to waste two perk points.\nI don't know what demon possessed Bethesda to make them think that this would be a good idea, but why are critical hits determined by a crit meter instead of being random? Also, if they aren't going to be determined by chance, then why are the two perks that govern crits, as well as the fill up rate of the crit meter itself, determined by luck? If you're in an immersive fight, you don't just say "I'm lucky, and I'm going to get a crit now", you say "God, I hope I get a crit now, or I'm Deathclaw chow."\nOne of the large problems I have with the armor crafting is how half the recipes are only unlocked by siding with the railroad. I don't really care about the railroad, so why do I need to side with them if I want to reinforce my corsair armor? Each side is supposed to come with its own perks, but still, this seems to be a hefty road block.\nThe layered armor system is underwhelming. By that, I mean that there are only a few bits of clothing that are compatible with it. Anything that isn't road/raider leathers, vault jumpsuits, etc. isn't compatible with armor pieces. Some things I could understand, like Kellogg’s armor, but other bits of clothing still look as if they should be able to support it.\nThe settlement building feels like it was thrown in last minute. The electricity system is difficult to work with, given that wires can't go through the walls, and it's hard to tell what lights in my house are actually being affected by the conduits. Plus, some things require a direct connection, which makes things even more difficult if you want your house fully enclosed. I think my biggest issue, however, is the absence of any kind of weapon rack or armor stand. I like to be able to display my collections.\nThe weapon system in this game feels like it was taken from borderlands and combined with a basic modding system. By that, I mean that your "unique" weapons are randomly generated and generally found on really powerful enemies or sometimes in shops. Personally, I liked the way FO:NV handled this more, where unique weapons had their own skins, and only one of them existed for each weapon type.\nThe thing I don't understand about the energy weapons is how a laser pistol and a laser rifle use the same ammo type. It kind of defeats the purpose of using a pistol over the rifle. Any pistol can be upgraded to a rifle, and rifles are more accurate while aiming and less when firing from the hip. But if an enemy is close enough to warrant firing from the hip, then accuracy isn’t relevant, because they are probably right in front of the barrel anyway.\nWeapons and armor (with the exception of power armor) don't decay, which makes little sense when you're using things that are 200 years old. Given the kind of strain your gear goes through, it's nice to have some kind of repair system in place so that wanton shooting has more of a consequence than just losing ammo.\nThe world itself feels a bit too bright and vibrant for post-apocalypse (excluding the Glowing Sea). I'm not saying I want FO3 level of bleakness, but something a little darker here would have been good.\nThe karma system has been done away with, and that just sucks. It was an important element of past games, especially for anyone who didn’t want to play the knight in shining armor. The way FO4 was done, you are forced to be a messiah, even if you want to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nDepending on the faction, a lot of the side quests involve building/maintaining/defending settlements. It was stated at E3 that settlements would be an optional thing, but it turns out that was an incredible lie.","June 3","false","136.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

From the perspective of Fallout 3, Fallout 4’s combat is an improvement, but lacks RPG elements from the previous title. However, in comparison to New Vegas, FO4 is a huge step back in nearly every way. The story in my opinion is less relatable and overly specific to the character that Bethesda has made for you to play, sacrificing creativity if you like to roleplay your characters. Visually, while the models of FO4 are much better than the Gamebryo engine of FO3 and NV, the textures are simply awful. I noticed this most when looking at a ghoul standing in the mud with the sun to its back. The part that stuck out to me was that the ghoul, the ground, and the sky behind both looked unpleasantly similar. The textures in 3 and NV are clear, easy to define, and most importantly, not blurry, FO4 feels as though you’re playing the game wearing a pair of mud covered goggles with the sun in your eyes. Another problem is the game feels like it’s still in alpha, this pip boy’s functions are sluggish, especially the favorited items. Often times “quick” favorites don’t work at all, leaving you weaponless as mole rats gnaw at your hind, the faster solution is to manually access the items from your pip boy. Which brings me to another point. The inventory system is a MESS. There isn’t a lot to say about this besides forget about ever finding anything in the MISC tab. I’ll try to end this sooner rather than later by saying if you didn’t like previous fallout games for being too dialog and roleplay heavy, this is the post-apocalyptic game for you. If you are a fan of previous fallout games, be weary.\n\nTL;DR: Made on an outdated engine and it shows, watered down for a bigger audience, buggy unpolished game left for modders to attempt to fix.\n","May 29","false","140.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Over 180 hours in, I just could not care anymore.\n\nThe story is a disaster. Bethesda are not great with story to begin with, but this game was beyond boring. It was grossly linear and predictable. Story is what pushes me to finish games to completion. I played every single quest and side quest in The Witcher 3. Even Skyrim - with over 600 hours in - I finsihed everything to completion. I did not even like Skyrim all that much. Only 2 characters in the entire game are half decent. I don't need a brilliant story like BioShock, Mass Effect or Witcher. The new Doom had better writing than this. Really sad, since there is great lore in the Fallout universe.\n\nSure, gameplay is better than in previous Fallout shooters, but that does not say much. It is still a Bethesda game, and the gunplay and RPG elements are rudimentary at best. The weapon mods are nicely implemented. Base building was fun for the first few hours. It just becomes a chore very quickly and is very very limited with bad console concedes.\n\nGame looks 5 years old even when it came out, but runs incredibly poorly.

I know it's not easy to explain someone living for two hundred years, but why would we go with the most generic science-fiction explanation and say cryo-pods? Also, what’s Bethesda’s fetish with saving missing family members?\nThe voiced player character thing on a whole was a bad idea, and that can be said for almost any RPG where character creation is possible. When I play through a game like Fallout, I want to hear my character talk in my own voice. If I can't feel like I'm becoming the character I'm playing as, then it can't really be called a Role Playing Game.\nThe dialogue options are extremely limited. It's only four options, and they all basically lead to the same outcome. This kind of goes back to my last point about a voiced PC being a bad idea, because it really limits what the player can say in terms of dialogue. It isn't cost effective to have a voice actor (or two, in this case) record more than four lines per selection, in addition to all the in-between things the PC says.\nThe way the "plot" (and I use that term loosely) unfolds, it feels as if the game forces you to travel with a companion. What I find annoying is how you actually need the dog for one of the quests in the main story line. On top of this, I found that I was constantly being introduced to people who desperately wanted to travel with me. There’s the dog, then Piper, then Nick, and then the ones you get from siding with the BOS or railroad.\nAlso, while I'm on the subject of companions, why is it that you can only have one at a time? FO:NV allowed for two without mods. One human and one non-human. FO4 makes it impossible to have your own posse, if that’s what you want.\nThe perk system is weak. Several of the perks are just access to crafting items, a few are for combat, and some are just incredibly stupid, like Aquaboy/girl (from the get-go, you can gain the ability to breathe underwater and not take any radiation damage from swimming). Oh, and did you accidentally scrap the only power armor station at the settlement you were using for your house? Well, if you want it back, then you have to take BOTH ranks of the local leader perk. That effectively screws over anyone running a low charisma build (it requires 6), and puts a level lock (14) on being able to build workstations at your settlements, not to mention having to waste two perk points.\nI don't know what demon possessed Bethesda to make them think that this would be a good idea, but why are critical hits determined by a crit meter instead of being random? Also, if they aren't going to be determined by chance, then why are the two perks that govern crits, as well as the fill up rate of the crit meter itself, determined by luck? If you're in an immersive fight, you don't just say "I'm lucky, and I'm going to get a crit now", you say "God, I hope I get a crit now, or I'm Deathclaw chow."\nOne of the large problems I have with the armor crafting is how half the recipes are only unlocked by siding with the railroad. I don't really care about the railroad, so why do I need to side with them if I want to reinforce my corsair armor? Each side is supposed to come with its own perks, but still, this seems to be a hefty road block.\nThe layered armor system is underwhelming. By that, I mean that there are only a few bits of clothing that are compatible with it. Anything that isn't road/raider leathers, vault jumpsuits, etc. isn't compatible with armor pieces. Some things I could understand, like Kellogg’s armor, but other bits of clothing still look as if they should be able to support it.\nThe settlement building feels like it was thrown in last minute. The electricity system is difficult to work with, given that wires can't go through the walls, and it's hard to tell what lights in my house are actually being affected by the conduits. Plus, some things require a direct connection, which makes things even more difficult if you want your house fully enclosed. I think my biggest issue, however, is the absence of any kind of weapon rack or armor stand. I like to be able to display my collections.\nThe weapon system in this game feels like it was taken from borderlands and combined with a basic modding system. By that, I mean that your "unique" weapons are randomly generated and generally found on really powerful enemies or sometimes in shops. Personally, I liked the way FO:NV handled this more, where unique weapons had their own skins, and only one of them existed for each weapon type.\nThe thing I don't understand about the energy weapons is how a laser pistol and a laser rifle use the same ammo type. It kind of defeats the purpose of using a pistol over the rifle. Any pistol can be upgraded to a rifle, and rifles are more accurate while aiming and less when firing from the hip. But if an enemy is close enough to warrant firing from the hip, then accuracy isn’t relevant, because they are probably right in front of the barrel anyway.\nWeapons and armor (with the exception of power armor) don't decay, which makes little sense when you're using things that are 200 years old. Given the kind of strain your gear goes through, it's nice to have some kind of repair system in place so that wanton shooting has more of a consequence than just losing ammo.\nThe world itself feels a bit too bright and vibrant for post-apocalypse (excluding the Glowing Sea). I'm not saying I want FO3 level of bleakness, but something a little darker here would have been good.\nThe karma system has been done away with, and that just sucks. It was an important element of past games, especially for anyone who didn’t want to play the knight in shining armor. The way FO4 was done, you are forced to be a messiah, even if you want to be an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.\nDepending on the faction, a lot of the side quests involve building/maintaining/defending settlements. It was stated at E3 that settlements would be an optional thing, but it turns out that was an incredible lie.","June 3","false","136.3"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

Fallout 4 was greatly lacking in that department. However, Fallout 4 displayed vast improvements in combat, visuals, character models and customization (I was really tired of the horribly similliar baby-faced character models of Fallout 3 + New Vegas. In Fallout 4 you can actual make something that looks like a human being, and customize it to look as you want, not just adjust sliders and pray you can live with the results). If you look away from the previous games, Fallout 4 is alright. Better that most other games out there, but not by much.\n\nIn Fallout 4 you have no impact on the world and the people in it. You have but a limited number of endings, then a ♥♥♥♥♥on of brainless radiant quests to occupy you after you beat the game and every side quest in it after 20 hrs. But I guess the first 20 hours are pretty good. Then you can go replay the game a couple of times to get all the endings (because the game barely has any content) and go back to Fallout: New Vegas. To sum up: Fallout 4 looks great visually, great improved, more fluent and better animated combat, but it can barely be called an RPG. It will entertain you. You will get somewhat your money's worth. But ultimately; it is a stain upon the franchise. It's good game. Just not of the trademark Fallout-quality I was promised.\n\n6/10\n\nI pray that the next Fallout game will have the visuals and character customization of Fallout 4, but also the feel, soul, roleplaying and world-impacting of Fallout, Fallout 2, Fallout: New Vegas (not Fallout 3. Fallout 3 was ♥♥♥♥). That would be the most perfect game ever. Until then, you should just play the previous games.","February 18","false","270.6"," 18 of 29 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","18","29","0","9"

Seems to me you've spent way too much time in the 1950s to realize that you need to innovate in order to stay relevant as a major game developer out there. Unless you wanna be assimilated with the likes of Activision or Ubisoft. As much as I enjoyed Fallout 3 & New Vegas in addition to many other fantastic titles in your repertoire (Rage, Dishonored, Wolfenstein the New Order, Skyrim) I must admit my utter disappointment with Fallout 4.\n\nYou've joined the alarmingly increasing number of publishers and developers who put profits and marketing well above the quality of the actual product they deliver to the gaming scene.\nFallout 4 is an unexceptional game. It is its precursor Fallout 3 that makes it unexceptional. You've added incremental content value to a game that is esentially another episode in the Fallout saga while improving virtually nothing on the technical side. For a game that came 7 years after its precursor and 5 years after the sequel to the latter, Fallout 4 is little else other than unexceptional.\n\nTruth be told, I never appreciated the aforementioned titles because of their graphics prowess because that was clearly never their strong suit, but they were somewhat authentic and clever in their own right, traits that Fallout 4 sorely lacks and desperately needs.\nThe game is technically broken on all platforms, it's effectively an artistic rehash with enhanced mindless shooter elements and sadly not much to be remembered by other than a minecrafty component to pass the time in between slow-motion shooting and staring at blandly animated dialogue sessions.\n\nCurrently, Fallout 3 bundled with New Vegas are better value than Fallout 4.

While it does feature a vast amount of content as per usual with Bethesda titles, I will say that after 130 hours of total game time, I am left with a rather underwhelming feeling towards this game. Sure, I did enjoy leaving the vault and exploring Sanctuary Hills, meeting Preston and learning about the Minutemen, heading towards Diamond City and stumbling upon so many nooks and crannies in the game world, however, that's where the fun stops for me. The characters seem rather flat- even more so than they did in previous Beth titles. I felt railroaded af as well. For example: upon reaching Concord, a man named Preston Garvey will call out to you for aid against raiders who apparently have breached the museum that him and his fellow survivors are taking refuge in. You receive a new quest. Typically, in a Fallout game, you will have multiple ways to approach a scenario like this. In Fallout 4, that is not the case. Depending on how you look at it, you have either one or two options: A) you can be a hero and kill off all the attacking raiders, and agree to mow down the second wave of them, or, B) you can decide not to help at all, in which case the quest will still remain active, and you will still have to fight off all of the raiders anyways. Want to help the raiders? Nope, they'll just shoot at you. Want to kill Preston for whatever reason? You can shoot, punch and stab all you want, but after he's done recuperating on the floor, he'll just shrug it off and keep fighting you until you run away or die. Now, that was just an example. To me, the majority of the quests that I completed felt the same way.\n\nAnother thing that bothers me, as it did for many others, is the lack of a skill system. This is something else that has been prominent in previous Fallout Games, as well as all Bethesda titles. I have always felt that allowing your character the ability to specialize in specific skills is what made these games so much fun to play/replay. I honestly found myself missing the days of using my proficiency in certain skills to be more successful in completing quest objectives or obtaining information during dialog, and there were a few instances in the game where I definitely felt as though having a skill system would have made the situation a lot more dynamic and interesting.\n\nI was also disappointed to realize that many useful features introduced in Fallout: New Vegas, such as Hardcore Mode, Traits, Faction Armor, and the ability to craft ammunition, did not carry over into this game. While I have no doubt in my mind that modifications will address the lack of all of these features, it makes absolutely no sense to me as to why these weren't included in the first place.\n\nTL:DR Exploring the Commonwealth is fun, but the world itself suffers from lack of depth, and the roleplaying aspects of this game have been immensely reduced. Fallout 4 takes one step forward and two steps backward IMHO.","January 27","false","183.3"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","20","33","0","0"

Hands off to Bethesda to providing a game that didn't crash upon it's release on my achient Mayan technology of a computer.  Although the game does run at a max of 25 frames on this potato, I still enjoy every minute I spend trying to craft the ultimate 10mm pistol.  Jokes aside, this game dominated Fallout 3 and New Vegas by creating a, ironically, alive world.  Even though the map may seem smaller, there is so much packed into its confines that you will barely notice.  Raider dens lurk at every corner, settlements demand attention, and that stupid dog is tripping all of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ landmines that litter the world.  The town building system is suprisingly effecient and I've spent hours just messing around with the backyard fence, trying to get it to line up correctly.  Once finished I then invited settlers to live there, only for them to later be killed by raiders who took over my base.  Speaking about which, there's nothing more shocking to gleefully killing a raider nest only to find that they were simply starving settlers who resorted to stealing so they could feed themselves.  Haha, you're such a riot Besthesda!  The world is full of the classic Fallout dark humor!  The only real thing I have problems with is that the game doesn't really keep anything from you.  I've barely taken off the power armor because I keep finding fusion cores all over the place.  I'm not saying it makes me overpowered, but it does make the game a lot easier, even on the hardest difficulty.  The game is glitchy to all hell.  I'm not sure you know this, dear developer, but the bugs don't always make the game any better.  They don't really take much away from the gameplay itself, however, most of them can be ignored.  There are exceptions, for example; I went into a building and managed to get past most of the doors only to find out that this area was part of a side quest that activated once I reached a certain point even though I had yet to talk to anyone involved in the quest.  Said quest now cannot be completed and it bugs the hell out of me.  In conclusion, I would recommend the game to fans and new player alike.  Fallout 4 is a widely entertaining world that just about anyone can enjoy.\n\nEdit 1\nFixed some spelling errors","November 15, 2015","true","44.5"," 61 of 111 people (55%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","55","61","111","5","0"

Don't get me wrong it was very fun, it's just the fact that it doesnt feel like your normal fallout title. Really the worst thing about it was the lack of "fallout-ness". First lets start with the price, the price in my opinion is wayyyyyyyy too high for a game with like what 3-4 endings and like a few good quests. Even before the ending the whole game got very repetetive very quick. Shoot super mutants, shoot raiders, shoot super mutants, SHOOT RAIDERS, SHOOT SOME MORE SUPER MUTANTS CUZ WHY NOT. Exploring was very boring and painful, run run run run run town run run run run lake run run run run oh hey MORE SUPER MUTANTS. Combine that with the 5 minutes it takes to ♥♥♥♥ing fast-travel and your set. Bethesda: Oh hey why don't we just remove like every perk and make there not point to leveling up because we can. Ugh there wasn't even that much to explore like come on, we got us a big map but about 25% of it IS UNDER ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ WATER. The dialog system is a joke, Fallout New Vegas had like 3 dialog options for every line of text. And the "glowing sea" is not a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ glowing sea, its a ♥♥♥♥ing waste land area THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE SEA.

With that being said, I still believe my initial review is still significant in representing how some fallout fans would feel after finishing the game. I held onto how I felt initially for a while, so it's not like I've had a sudden change of heart. So, in conclusion, The initial review will still be up until further notice, as well as the thumbs down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy review is not a meme.\nMy review is not going to be an MLA Format Essay.\nMy review is not for the sake of keeping this game at 80 percent positive ratings or to get it lower than that.\nWith that being said, I did not like this game.\n\nDear Fallout Community,\n\nI am not going to say specifically why I do not like or recommend this game simply because other reviewers and Fallout fans have already done a much better job than me. They've touched upon all the points I would've made and more if I tried to write and actual review, so go look at other LEGITIMATE reviews if you want a proper, constructive opinion.\n\nThis is merely to warn any new players going into the Fallout series. Fallout 4 is NOT Fallout at its finest. While it's gameplay, asthetic, customization and crafting has reached new leaps and bounds, what classified this series as an RPG is COMPLETELY dumbed down and streamlined. Dialogue, characters, world building and consequences to name a few, have all been marked for death in the making of this game. Fallout NV has done a much better job in integrating FPS elements into the Fallout franchise, and in my opinion is the better buy.\n\nLastly, and this goes to all the remaining passengers of the hype train: enough with the childish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It took Bethesda 7 YEARS to make a fully polished experience, and they took that opportunity and wiped their asses with it. It's time to stop giving this company the free pass in giving us a technological defect and persecuting those complaining about these issues. It's also time to stop thumbing up memes and thumbing down valid criticism. I'm well aware that there are grown ♥♥♥ men and women out there that refuse to let valid opinions criticize the game they played simply because they don't want to be told they made a bad 60 dollar investment. Guess what? You're not helping. This game series is not going to get better because you keep trying to make everything rainbows and sunshines instead of letting this game get the mini nuke it deserves from other fans.

Bethesda, by any stretch of the imagination, could've made this an excellent Fallout, learning from the actions of NV and the criticisms of fans. But instead, they remained shackled to the design decisions, the design philosophy, and the same dated, restrictive, wheezing engine from 2002 - With a few "Upgrades" to try and keep it standing when it's beaten to a pulp just by games like GTA V's physics engine, and left tragically in the dust by Witcher 3 in nearly every aspect.\n\nDespite all that though, it's still a fun game at the core. Bethesda had a well but misplaced intent in the game, and it shows. There are genuinely great moments in FO4, and the Settlement building is actually really really fun at times. Through the cracks, there's great quality. But it doesn't excuse the game's entire gameplay philosophy is deeply skewered by a terribly simplified un-Fallout Perkchart system.\n\nAll in all, a very hyped up and otherwise what would be an exemplary game is dragged down by the corporate fumbling and cripplingly unfitting design decisions. Though not necessarily terrible, it is, like I said earlier, like Bethesda is trying to squeeze a square peg in a round Fallout-shaped hole. It's not what the fans want. It's not what I want, and from some public reviews, even casual gamers can tell it's not what they want either.\n\nI give this game a thumbs up because it is still at it's core a good game, but deeply, deeply flawed in the series it's trying to represent.","April 21","true","549.5"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","12","18","0","3"

I 100% completely the game, ever mission, every dlc, every location found, every unique weapon found, every sending, every achievment (on console). When New Vegas came out, I was excited and bought a collector's edition, I was 100% satisfied with the game. I also 100% completely the game.\nSome years later, Fallout 4 was announced.

I was so happy to finally play it, only to be disappointed right away.\n\n3 hours:\nI played the game for 3 hours and I was already frustrated that I played too much and couldn't refund it. The leveling up system is awful, it's completely different from the usual Fallout leveling up system (it's similar to skyrim, but worse), the game is buggy (but what bethseda game isn't buggy amirght?). One of the biggest issues for me is that the game will not launch in windows 8, I ugraded to windows 10 and it started working, but my others game didn't work so I went back. I need to wait until I fix this to write further review updates. The biggest problem is the game mechanics are down right confusing (gotta google some shiz), power armour is awful now too (at least for me)\n\n5/10 I recommend to new players who never played the series, don't recommend to old fallout players, because this isn't fallout.\n","December 31, 2015","false","5.6"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","1"

But I didn't want to blow up that cool Brotherhood-style war zeppelin, nor did I want to destroy the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ Institute! There is no choice involved, you're stuck with these absolutist "choices". I found myself not wanting to do the final questline, there is 0 choice. That brings me to point 2.\n\n2) You can't influence the story in a real way!\nThere I stood at roughly 60 hours of gameplay, being the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ MINUTEMEN GENERAL AND THE INSTITUTE BOSS AT THE SAME TIME! And what did it matter? None! None at all! Preston and Father still order you around like you're some manboy servant, your opinion doesn't matter, what you envision doesn't matter, it's massacring the Railroad, shooting down the Brotherhood zeppelin, or blowing up the Institute. There, now choose two. That will be your ending. That's it. Have fun.\n\n3) The godforsaken Minutemen\nEven though the sentence "Another settlement needs your help!" has probably burned into my mind till the end of times, I still did the Minutemen quests! I was like "Hey, let's annex all these territories, and then we can shape this place up a littlebit!". Oh how naive I was. There is no point in building new settlements. There is no point pimping your settlements. Why? Because it will not matter at all. I was hoping I'll be able to establish a government with the Minutemen, maybe even organize a truce between the hostile factions, create my own little council, but no, it's all about building f**** beds. That's it. That's the Minutemen.\n\n4) The ending SUCKS\nThis is Mass Effect 3 all over again, except worse. In the original ME3, at least you had 3 kinds of explosions. Here, all endings are basically the same. Some generic, uninspiring monologue, the game doesn't show you what you've accomplished, doesn't give you closure, nah.\n\nIn every other aspects, the game excels, particularly in the shooting parts. But it's just a shooter at this point, a good shooter, but I want more from a Fallout game. I don't want Call of Duty: Nuclear Warfare, I want a game where your choices matter. Where you can work towards your desired goal. Fallout 4 doesn't allow that, and it ruins the whole thing, Bought it for 40€, but in retrospect, I would have skipped this one.

Only valentine was remotely enjoyable.\nThe quests, oh lord the quests were HORRIBLE. Radiant, fetch, or kill quests make up like 75% of them.  I cant think of more than 2 or 3 quests or locations that were memorable.\nThe lack of karma or skills was such a horrible move and the voiced characters only limited roll playing and extensive dialogue options. Where are the skill or S.P.E.C.I.A.L diologue checks?

This is a brief review about personal sense of adventure I've gotten from Fallout 4, which wasn't that great so far.\n\nKnowing that this is 2015 and it's Bethesda's biggest title yet, and so many years in waiting and development, this is a disappointment. Expected something  more exciting. Yes I've played other Bethesda games, loved each for their epic adventures.\n\nIt's still fun to play I guess, some elements are good like crafting and building.\nNo I do not care about graphics or textures or pixels, if you look in my game library you'll see that my most played games are not those that shine and stand out with amazing graphics. So this review has nothing to do with graphics or aesthetics of Fallout 4.\n\nFallout 4 just doesn't feel like 60£ game. One day I wandered around the world looking for things to do and honestly... couple of random houses filled with glowing zombies, some dying people with treasure maps etc, very exciting... not really.\n\nExplanation to my negative thoughts: I took GTA V and Witcher 3 to compare them with Fallout 4, both of those games had extremely fun intros and just so much to do from the first 20 mins into the game, you could go anywhere and do anything. All the sidequests and side-things to do were immensily interesting and exciting to do. However in fallout 4 I had to craft 4 beds and get some tatos to grow in the garden...\n\nAnd Bethesda wants us to pay almost total of 80£ for both game and season pass in order to get content we ought to have just for buying just the base game...\n\nI DO NOT recommend the game at its current state mainly for these reasons:\n- Currently lot of bugs and glitches some of which that can be abused, such as bottle cap vendor glitch, stuck enemy npc's -- just shoot them while they can't do anything else.\n- Unable to change FOV, wtf?\n- Season pass... never liked this, lot of games has this and they want us to buy the season pass blindly without even giving any hint of what kind of future dlc's are we even getting, this is absurd. For all we know, that DLC might come in a year or two by which time some might get fed up with the game...","November 11, 2015","false","105.5"," 34 of 60 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","34","60","0","2"

The atmosphere in this game is just beautiful; I'm pretty sure I have like 20 hours on this game just wandering aimlessly apreciating the tiny details that Bethesda have added to the game. Although the map isn't massive it's so jam packed with content you constantly find new things to explore or side characters to meet. I love the side quests in this game. Quests like The U.S.S Constitution missions and The Yangtze are particular favourites. And if you're not fussed on those theres hundreds of other side quests to do.\nNow comes the bit where I talk about the one major thing that lets this game down. The stupid, poorly written story is one of the worst things I have ever seen. I felt no connection between my character and Sean, the sick minded, cancerous devil who made your life misery even though he wanted you to find him son. It's as if the writers took the first draft, didn't check it and said "right then boyos, we off down the dugout?" Todd should be ashamed. If Bethesda are gonna take on Fallout then they ought to write good stories instead of this poor attempt. In my current and 5th playthrough of the game im currently lvl 35 and I've still got the quest "visit diamond city" because I cant be arsed with that awful side of the game.\nOn that note I have to say I recommend this game. Don't pay full price for it because it definately isn't worth that. Many of the characters are interesting, the side quests are great and the base building is practically another game in itself.\nBuy this game if it gets 50% off or something it's very very fun.\n\nNow, in true Bethesda style I'm going to end this review without checking for mistakes.\n\nFin.","March 8","true","181.8"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","13","20","3","8"

Heck, I haven't even made it to Diamond City yet, which is technically where the real game starts.\n\nReason being is that there is just much friggin' things you can do in this game. So I've been wandering around TRYING to get to Diamond City yet always seem to find a new settlement site that I can build up, recruit survivors, arm and equip them, build up their settlement, scavange for supplies and building materials for them, set up supply lines and open stores in them.\n\nThen I head down the road TRYING to get to Diamond City and what-do-you-know...the MInutemen find a new potential settlement site where the few surviving settlers need to be rescued from their vir...err...\n\nMaybe one day I'll reach Diamond City and start the storyline of the game in earnest...one day...\n\nThere are multiple difficulty options, completely free-to-roam open world. The crafting is absolutely fantastic, where you can take even the most lowly, humble piece of gear and upgrade it to something you'll feel comfortable wearing the rest of your time in the Wasteland.\n\nHeck even tin cans and pencils serve a very valuable commodity resource. Everything in the world either has value or wants to kill you or be your BFF, sometimes both...\n\nThere are random legendary mobs in the wasteland, everything from legendary wild dogs and deer to super mutants and goliaths. Each drops a legendary set item, be it armor or weapon. Even then you can strip the nice bonuses off of your old gear, attach them to your shiny new legendary gear, so this game caters to everything.\n\nTons and tons of empty buildings and sites to discover and explore, volumes of lore to read and see, eye-popping visuals, great music, multi-layered NPC's, intelligent enemies who'll flank you, snipe you, blast you, or play dead til you turn your back to them, and this is just the base game.\n\nIMHO, after playing hundreds and hundreds of hours of the former Fallouts (check my game history), I can easily say this is the best of the series, so as my TLDR heading says; The question isn't SHOULD you buy the game. The true question is Why HAVEN't you bought the game already?! It's a must-own for any open-world RPG shooter fan.","December 10, 2015","true","647.6"," 24 of 41 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","24","41","3","1"

Roflstomp","http://steamcommunity.com/id/armsoutstretched/","57 products in account","♥♥♥♥, I wish I didn't have to write this review.\nFirst off, don't buy the hype. It's all made to make you feel great about buying it and make you excited for "TEH INTRECATE STOREY AND VO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!" One of the first characters you meet's voice is ♥♥♥♥in' ♥♥♥♥. Preston Garvey is trashtier 0/10\n\nIt's obvious Bethesda tried ever so hard to push their devs to make the release date, instead of delaying it and making a quality game. They solely rely on their endless drones to make mods that make the game playable whatsoever, and I must say the base game is ♥♥♥♥ing ♥♥♥♥. Generic story, ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game designs, linear building structure, (Go forward, open the doors on the left and right and grab as many ♥♥♥♥ as you can and repeat.)\n\nThe only reason I bought this game was because of the hype, and I regret it. I have to hand it to them though, they make the game seem okay for 2 hours, so when the game's novelty (And Valve's refund policy) wears off, they have your money and you can't do jackshit. Bravo, Bethescuck.\n\nSo, let's dig into this thing.\n\nPros:\n\n- Customization is extremely wide, there's a multitude of things to customize and create, as well as perks that further enhance your abilities\n- Story is quite interesting for the most part\n- Companion AI has improved (Slightly.)\n- No more ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t weapon deterioration (You don't have to spend 2430 caps to repair your assault rifle after using it for a minute or so.)\n- The building in this game is superb, I must say. It's like Sims with turrets and mines.\n- The graphics, granted you have the correct system, is pretty nice.\n- The face designer is pretty tight.\n- Atmosphere feels pretty mysterious and strong, compliments the enviroment well.\n\nCons: (Here we go.)\n\n- Level scaling is non-existant. I ran into super-mutants with Rocket Launchers at level 11, I was punished for exploring and being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\n- Annoying enemies. HURR MEE DUM DUM MUTANT ME SMASH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA\n- Limited weapons. Making your weapons customizable doesn't give an excuse for you to be lazy and implement a handful of weapons.\n- NPCs frequently walk away from you while you talk to them, and then blame you for leaving.\n- 4 options of dialogue. Need I say more?\n- Insane difficulty curves. See my first con.\n- Annoying, repetitive characters than spout the same dialogue every time.\n- Marcy Long. ♥♥♥♥. THIS. ♥♥♥♥♥.\n- Glitches galore. I frequently got trapped on crafting screens for no reason other than Tab decided not to respond.\n- Overhyped as ♥♥♥♥. Most ingame features in the trailers were extorted to such an extent that it seemed OGM AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n- Season Pass. Season Pass? That's right ladies and gentlemen, DLC ontop of a £40 game. I can't make this ♥♥♥♥ up.\n- Still no Creation Kit. You'd think they'd just release this with the game.\n- Sound design is pretty sub-par. Bad VO and some guns sound like stock sounds.\n- I get frequent FPS problems even with settings on low.\n- Textures seem poorly optimised.\n- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ design choices. You start out with a minigun and power armour 3 minutes into the game.\n- Hard to obtain ingredients that are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. (You know the game is ♥♥♥♥ed when you'd rather buy 2500 caps worth of Sticky Tape than a Fat Man.)\n- ♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ companions hate you at the slightest of choices. Stole that (scarce) adhesive junk item? You're evil!!!!!!!!\n- Hardly any points to spend on S.P.E.C.I.A.L.\n- ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plot twists. I won't spoilerino, but they're highly predictable and make no sense.\n- Power Armour is clunky and useless now. You have to scout around the map to find random cores and it's highly impractical to use.\n- Some viewmodels are highly intrusive, like the Institute Laser Rifle , which takes up half your screen.\n- Broken Perks. 2000% V.A.T.S Headshot accuracy is fair and balanced 👌👌👌\n- Boring quests that just lead you on a goosehunt around the map, collecting random crap and fighting endless hordes of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t enemies.\n\nI wish, I wish OH GOD I wish I didn't have to type this out. But it has to be said, it's ♥♥♥♥. Let's hope the godsend modders out there will help make this pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good.\n\nLet's hope.\n\n*PS: For the record I don't want to hate this game","December 2, 2015","false","67.6"," 162 of 304 people (53%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","53","162","304","19","13"

Bethesda has never really been good at game development, but these days it's seen as nearly a crime to make a game so bug/glitch-ridden as this, with a sub-par storyline and the only non-quest fun to have on the side is building a house with poor building mechanics.\n\nWhen you run with your weapon out in Skyrim, and you put it away while running, you will still have the running animation, but will also still be using up stamina as though you were still running, but you're actually going the same speed as though you were walking.\n\nWhat I mean by mentioning this, is a few things:\n*Games need to be tested. I don't care how big of a company you are, you developers out there need to test a feature to make sure it works just as intended when you add it.\n*Even though it's been ~4 years since its release, Skyrim is still just as buggy as when it came out. What did Bethesda do about this? Nothing. They haven't even considered fixing the bug-infested mess of a game. Instead, they left it to the community to make and release game patches and fixes themselves. Which leads to my last point;\n*You do not ever make the community be a vital part of the development.\n...\nIt was also really annoying that it's 24 bloody gigabytes for such a broken game which you know for a fact will not be well patched if they ever decide to even fix some issues.\n\nOnce again a game released by Bethesda that was clearly never even tested during development as could be told from the very beginning of the game. Terrible job, will  refund and MAYBE buy around christmas if it's on sale for a decent price.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/farxin/recommended/377160/","farxin","Farxin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/farxin/","110 products in account","I couldn't make my mind whether to recommend Fallout 4 or not, and this review is propably the closest to how I feel about the game. I finally decided to recommend it, because it's a good game, you can't take that away, but it's a tragical victim to high expectations and deadly rival-The Witcher 3.\n\nLet's begin with the good stuff:\nGunplay: Shooting in Fallout 4 is great, no matter what weapon you use. Gunfights are more dynamic, enemies' behaviour is more realistic. Great improvement over Fallout:New Vegas and Fallout 3.\nWeapon and armor customization: Replacing expensive gun modifications with smart and cheap-ish modification system. You can change most important parts of your weapon, name it, make it more personal and in some cases alter the way you use it. Without a doubt great addition to the series.\nLegendary loot: Basically overpowered, extremely rare weapons and armor. Love it.\nVATS: They did a few changes that I really like. VATS no longer stops time, just slows it down, which gives you limited time to react, what works great with more dynamic combat. Also, crits are no longer random, you full up a crit bar by successfully hitting enemies, then use stored crit whenever you please. I can finally crit when I really need to.\nSprint: Further improvement to dynamics of the game.\nDog: I love Dogmeat. So do you.\nCooking: The odd one on this list but I really like how they made food a really viable way of healing.Now things that are bad:\nTextures: They're just ugly in most cases. I've got textures set to ultra and they still look pretty bad. I'd expect more in 2015. Overall visual experience isn't that bad though.\nStory: I really don't like it. I don't want to put any spoiler here, but main character's aim simply kills all roleplay.\nTechnical issues: There's a ton of examples: cannot change FOV, supports only 16:9 and 16:10 monitors, invisible locks and so on...\nUI: No improvement at all, might have gotten worse actually :(\nSettlement building: I was really hyped about that one but Bethesda totally let me down. No real tutorial, it's obligatory though, clunky, doesn't feel that great at all. Too bad. That's a really cool concept, but it could have been implemented way better.\n\nThere's also some things I can't tell if are good or not.\nPower Armor: You get it too early, although it remains a luxury item as you need expensive power cores.\nVoice acting of main character: It's really well done, but it rips off another part of roleplay - the voice usually doesn't fit the character and limits dialogue options.\nFinally, why I wasn't so sure about recommending it. I played Witcher 3. The  Witcher 3 is without a doubt a better game and you can't avoid comparing them when both are 2015 RPG's. Fallout 4 can't even pick a fight with Polish beast at the moment, but I hope it will change with some fixes and mods.\nTL;DR\nI recommend this game, but unless you're a Fallout fanboy, this game isn't worth 60$. If you really want to spend 60$ on a game buy The Witcher 3. Otherwise wait for a big sale. Despite all its disadvantages Fallout is a ♥♥♥♥ ton of fun to play and I know I'll keep coming back, but I realise I'm not picky. If technical issues, clunky UI and bad story don't scare you - give it a try.","November 13, 2015","true","18.4"," 157 of 295 people (53%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","53","157","295","8","2"

FO4 has neither. The story feels bleh with it's "I have to save my son" cliche. This narrative makes exploring really stupid. If anyone has children and you saw your child kidnapped you wouldn't ♥♥♥♥ around with the Bother Hood of steel and all that bull ♥♥♥♥, it's stupid. You would go straight to Diamond City without a thought, you wouldn't waste time ♥♥♥♥ing city building or any of of that. This is really getting disappointing. I am trying to see the good in the new character design and think it will have potential once modders fix it, some perks should be general and not depend on a given stat. So far this game is mostly hype and very little innovation. As a stand alone game this would be a good re-release of borderlands or any type of FPS that has very little RPG elements, Bethesda didn't fully blow it but they should stop making RPGs.\n\nUpdate: My disappointment continues to grow as the endings have this ME3 feel to them. Crafting is just as bad as I thought and settelment building even worse. There is a specific build you must have in order reap the full benefits of both of these extremly good improvements to the game. After 70+ hours I am still let down by how Bethesda turned a great RPG to a chessy FPS.  Who the hell wants a romance option when you just saw your wife murdered? WTF Bethesda?\n\n\nPros:\nVATS has improved but the slow mo effect really takes away from the RPG feel\nPower Armor customization is really interesting (But getting it ten minutes in the game is ridiculous)\nSPECIAL seems to try to be innovative so being optomistic (Although this makes the game very limiting in terms of builds)\n\n\nCons:\nThe crafting is weak and pointless, most good crafting requires multiple perks across multiple SPECIALs so having certain builds limits crafting tremendously. In older fallouts crafting was just a matter of skill level.\nThe story is extremly ridiculous and a far cry from the better FO's (The revenge cliche in FONV at least made exploration plausable and logical)\nThe melee combat is just terrible, you'll see.\nCriticals are meant to be by chance, this crit meter is absurd\nThe game feels like an RPG made for COD players","November 11, 2015","false","250.0"," 27 of 47 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","27","47","0","0"

I'd still recommend this game, however, many people are disappointed in different aspects of it, and I agree with their disappointment.\n\nIf you enjoy truly developing a character that you will get to make your own, unfortunately you're not going to find that here.  I understand that they wanted to go with a voiced protagonist, maybe to shake things up or to put a twist on things, but I firmly believe that it simply does not work in a Fallout universe.  The lack of a karma system and interesting dialogue here is absolutely disappointing beyond words.\n\nHowever, I find every other aspect of the game to be fantastic.  The improvements to gunplay here are quite welcome to me, as I found the previous Fallouts to be lacking in that department.  The crafting has also been opened up on a new level, truly making a great idea more accessible to others via the scrapping system.  Even if you choose not to do that, the world Bethesda created in this title is fascinating.  While it is not the biggest, I'm finding so many little things at every turn that I don't know how people are complaining about it.  I'd rather have a big world full of interesting twists and turns than one that is massive and is lacking in parts.  I'm still working on story, but it's personally interesting to me so far.\n\nMy other gripes that will be fixable are the poor UI, and just the overall poor quality of the PC port itself.  I have a GTX 970 and an Intel i7, as well as 8 gigs of ram.  This game should have no excuse running flawlessly on my PC, but I have a lot of framerate issues in many different parts.  It's also disappointing that keys are not bindable.  These are minor gripes to me, however, because either Bethesda or modders will eventually fix them.\n\nOverall, I think you'll enjoy this game if you find these wastelands to be as interesting as I do.  While I don't believe this game lived up to the hype, I still think it deserves your time.

It's not a good story. Partially because it forces you to play the role of a parent for a kid you don't care about. You can't roleplay like in 1, 2, or NV. You are stuck in this role and you will like it.\n\nGameplay is a mixed bag. While the gunplay has gotten exponentially better, the gameplay itself feels sterile. There aren't any builds, there are no stats. You can level up and get every single perk you desire. They brought back Damage Resistance instead of Damage Threshold. The gun selection feels limited to pipe pistols or you grinding for slight modifications to some pre-existing weapons.  I'm not going to pretend that New Vegas was some masterpiece when it came to gameplay, but it felt more consistent with everything that it did.\n\nWriting in general is pretty oka-HATES NEWSPAPERS. This is bad too, there's a dialogue wheel from Mass Effect. Jesus why. There's no choice in this game. None. You say yes, or no* (no means yes). The characters seem fine, but they do seem very disconnected from everything.\n\nAnd that's my biggest problem with this game, and Bethesda titles in general. Everything always feels disconnected. They were less awful about it with this game, but in general, Bethesda would rather make a bunch of different, isolated locations in their games, and not really have them connect well with other locations in the game. See Little Lamplight/Republic of Dave/etc. In a game where I want to be immersed in a world, Bethesda does everything in their power to make sure that you don't get that experience.\n\nIt's not an awful game, but it sure as hell isn't a good one either.

Many of the RPG elements have been stripped away from the game to focus primarily on player ability rather than avatar creation. Which isnt necessarily a bad thing. It just ends up feeling like at this point fallout is much more an FPS with rpg elements than the other way around.\n\nThe story is forced on you more so than other games and it's pretty lack luster. Side quests are more fun but only marginally. There are only a few that stand out in my memory as most boil down to go to a place kill some (raiders/ghouls/mutants) and return.\n\nReally it boils down to the same problems that were in Skyrim, there's a lot of potential but bland gameplay leaves the experience feeling overall unsatisfying.\n\nOverall if you liked Skyrim you'll like fallout 4, however if you were on the fence on fallout 3 you likely wont.\n\nI will suggest if you enjoy the sort of atmosphere that fallout provides but want a true rpg experience to go purchase Wasteland 2.","January 25","false","93.2"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","16","26","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/war-wizard/recommended/377160/","war-wizard","War Wizard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/war-wizard/","730 products in account","I would sue Bethesda for the horrible experience that was Fallout 4.\n\nIt’s been more than three months since I’ve began playing Fallout 4, and I’ve finally decided that I cannot keep playing this game. It has gotten to a point where it’s making me feel anxious and miserable, where it has become unhealthy to play this game.\n\nFallout 4 has gone from being a disappointment to becoming completely unbearable, to the point where I cannot keep playing for concern to my health. Right now, if I try to play the game for a couple of hours, I end up with symptoms of stress. There’s always nonsense being said about games making people violent, and nothing is ever said about how truly games can affect your health, specially badly designed games.\n\nLuckily I’m not affected by motion sickness nor any kind of epilepsy, because this game has enough bad visual effects to trigger all kinds of nasty responses of the human brain. I honestly cannot fathom how could this game came out looking so awful. I pity the console players which have no access to mods nor console commands to remove the horrible visual effects that are used throughout the game.\n\nAs I said, luckily I was not affected by those in an extreme way, which I’m sure some gamers have suffered, but I’ve felt the strain it has caused in my eyes and brain, in the form of a migraine. I had to limit my sessions with this game accordingly, to avoid the headaches. This wasn’t enough, I’ve still had other symptoms after a couple of hours of play: neck pain, stomachache, bruxism, and sleep disorders (yes, fallout was giving me nightmares).\n\nIn my case, all this symptoms generally appear when I’m suffering stress. How is it that a game is making me stressed? It’s supposed be entertainment, something I do to release stress.\n\nOne thing I noticed early on was that the ambient music was making me feel anxious all the time. Always gloomy, always dramatic, I tuned into the game’s radios to avoid it. I preferred the classical for a while, but it became too repetitive. Diamond city radio was awful at the beginning, but it became reasonably good after doing one of the side quests. I liked the songs, they gave dimension to the fallout world, but it also became repetitive after a while.\n\nI ended up playing without music at all, that’s when I realized that this game was felling more like a shooter than an RPG (since I usually turn off music in shooters to make it easier to hear footsteps). As a shooter, Fallout 4 is very mediocre, which is sensible, it’s supposed to be an RPG, other rules apply here, and a headshot may not kill everything in one shot because of that.\n\nAnyway, even as an RPG it falls short. After around level 25 I stopped caring about perks, stats, or equipment. It felt like it reached the most you could get from the gameplay, with just tiny variations which didn’t mean much. And, yeah, charisma sucks in this game, it’s mostly worthless in this “go here, kill everything” simulator.\n\nBefore getting into the writing of the game, I have to say something about the most horrible UI ever created. If something has to be said about Bethesda, it’s they are consistently getting better at making horrible UI. Adding to the fact that they have not learned anything from previous games (inventory management it’s still a masochist’s delight), they lowered the bar even more by making the most unusable base building system ever created.\n\nI sincerely expected them to copy any of the existing games that allow this kind of mechanic, but they actually come up with something that’s their own brand of awful. No amount of modding is ever going to make this system right. How could they have gotten this so wrong, having excellent examples to follow like Ark Survival Evolved or Space Engineers, is beyond me.\n\nFinally, the storytelling, how they failed this much marks a milestone. I’m not trusting Bethesda again, and I’m grateful I had the wits not preorder any DLC. I can hardly believe these are the same guys that made Skyrim, mind you, the story there wasn’t great, but it worked, it was solid, it was believable.\n\nSince the beginning of the game I knew what the plot twist was, it was predictable, but that didn’t bother me, actually that was what kept me going. I expected a better climax of the story, I knew they were leading me into a hard moral choice, but it wasn’t delivered in a believable manner. The characters development felt shallow, and I expected the main character to collide abruptly with the truth, instead it felt like Star Wars Episode 3.\n\nAnd then, the moral choice… it cannot be a binary decision, there has to be ground in the middle. After exploring each faction, you realize no one is evil, no one is good either. They all have misconstrued reality according to their bias and prejudice, but you don’t get a chance to rectify any of these.

I love Fallout games, and this game is a good game for sure. What it isn't, is Fallout.\n\nPros:\n-Settlement building, a bit clunky, and I despise privet hedges, but I love that we can do this!!\n\n-Weapon modding, while it feels like it limits the amount of weapons in the game, (as there are some mods/combinations that may never get touched or used), it adds a cool new element\n\n-Cait..enough said <3\n\n-Nick Valentine is pretty much the best voiced and dialogued character in this game, and my favorite vanilla companion of any Fallout. (sorry Nick, favorite all time companion is a modded one named Vanessa from New Vegas, she was amazingly done and I hope the author of her makes one for FO4)\n\n-Once the creation kit is released, (come on guys, that's like, the best part imo of pc games, and I wish it had been pretty much finished and usable around launch time), I feel like some absolutely EPIC mods will hit the game.\n\n-A lot of potential if they do things right for DLC and such. Maybe add seasons in, to a degree, and each real life holliday causes towns to decorate accordingly.\n\nCons:\n-You can't really be an evil guy, not that I do in games anyways usually, but that's the point, RPGs are about CHOICE\n\n-Your choices have almost no effect in the game\n\n-You get rushed through the beginning, meaning the main driving force of the game, doesn't drive you at all\n\n-Linear main story with a very bad ending that leaves a sour taste, resolves nothing, and invalidates the, (already non driven motivation), drive to find out the truth and fix things\n\n-Choices feel so limited, especially since most of the time, the choices lead to the same result\n\n-Main factions, of which it feels there are too few of, lead to crap choices at the end of their stories, with no way to change what has to be done\n\n-Might be personal bias here, but I miss the old system where skills/perks actually influenced dialogue and other things, and also miss gear degredation. It was something you had to keep on top of, and really made you more careful ad tactical, so as to preserve your stuff long enough to finish an area and get it repaired.\n\n-You can max out a character in every way and get every perk and max them. The great thing about an RPG, is that you can build specific roles with characters. There are actual builds people play and fit into and attempt to perfect. By every player being able to level until infinity. and max every single thing, there is nothing UNIQUE about any players. Sure, you have melee types, snipers, etc...but they could switch on a dime to be absolutely any role, any time. Let the mods do that, it shouldn't be a vanilla component. A level 300 Sole Survivor for example, can just mow over everything no problem and doesn't have to approach anything, with any sort of tactical mindset or thought\n\n-Game is too easy. I have NEVER liked playing games on their hardest difficulty, as it just doesn't feel worth the frustration to me, yet, I play this on survival, because that feels like hard mode to me. Enemies become bullet sponges for awhile, but even that goes away once you get a bit higher and have a good weapon. If enemies continued scaling with you, it would be much better than just adding a bunch of HP to them\n\n-Companions feel useless at some points. I like keeping one along, but since they have a level cap and you don't, they become something to just BE there. You can't adjust their tactics in any way like New Vegas, nor do they really fulfill any specific roles either.\n\n-Voice acting, I actually don't mind if it's voiced or not, but some of the voice acting is...pretty lackluster...Personally, I really dislike the Travis character, and he is the main reason I don't listen to the radio. I mean, your choices pretty much, are a station with some good music, but a vj some may like and some may not, classical music, (which I mean, not my cup of tea personally, and even THAT goes away if you choose the majority of ways the game can end, so those that DO like it, lose it), and some radio stories? Little more variety would have been nice, including the ability to place your own music into a personal station. (may not be immersive, but not everyone would have to use it, nor does everyone care about using the radio for lore reasons, they may just want some music in game)\n\n-Many missed opportunities. You never get to choose any kind of race you want to be, like super mutant, synth, ghoul... Though that may be a lot of extra work to bring it into the story somehow, still would be worth it. The area where the bombs land has nothing interesting there, combat zone is a letdown to what could have been, Diamond City is small and not very impressive...A cool feature would be to set up your own shop stall there, upgradeable, and place someone, or a protectron, in charge, and earn some caps that way. (yes you can build traders at your settlements, but the supposed, "hub", location could be a cool place to have a main shop\n\n-It's been 200 years, (can we not have a modern Fallout that isn't set in roughly the same 10-20 years or so?), how have people NOT learned to rake leaves or pick up trash in settlements? I mean, yea, some mods have made that a thing, but why should mods have HAD to?\n\n-Feels like a lack of enemy types, especially when it comes to raiders. Apparently all raiders are united? No separate factions of them?\n\n-Romance feels...empty...sure, some of the dialogue is really pretty good for trying to romance someone, (I'm a big fan of how Cait talks when romancing her, feels like a lot of character depth and soul baring). After that however, it just falls flat, you don't feel like it matters.\n\n-Why does settlement defense really matter much? You can build the best possible defense, but once you get attacked, unless you are there, things get destroyed anyways.\n\n-Companions ruin sneaking...\n\n-Everything in the entire map just feels way too similar, no variety.\n\n-Only one companion allowed, would be nice to have 2, especially with passive dialogue, could be plenty of jokes inserted there or drama, or witty banter, etc...At least 3 and NV, (if I remember correctly, it's been a bit), let you have 1 human and 1 non human at the same time\n\n-Weapon customization feels limited. I mean, who ISN'T going to use the parts that add the best stats? If maybe there were more options that let you paint the weapons, and choose different looking types of each mod, we could make some really unique ones\n\n-Feels like Bethesda made more of a skeleton and framework of a game for modders to finish and pretty up for them\n\n-Please, Bethesda, stop trying to rebuild the same engine over and over and push it to the limit, hurting a lot of things in the process. Use a new engine so you can push the limit even higher and create not just a game, but an experience that can't easily be forgotten!\n\n-Pretty big lack of children and their roles in this one, at least it feels that way.\n\n-The UI is still pretty clunky, the map, especially local, is a pain, especially with annoying scanlines and being hard to make out sometimes. The color of the HUD in power armor is headache inducing...\n\n-When you're done reading this review, another settlement needs our help, let me mark it on your map\n\nOn the races thing and enemy type thing, obviously aliens exist in this universe, so why not let them play a bigger part? Surely they can't ALL be bad and want to kill whatever they run across? Alien companion maybe? (preferably a different type of alien, as the current type aren't something I personally would want to run around with).

They clearly did not learn anything from Skyrim's *revolutionary design* of "Just use what you want to level up and it will" mechanic when an some of the population of ES fans disliked it when the game released. Yet they still put an entirely new "Perks over Skills" system into Fallout 4, which breaks most character builds that were possible in Fallout 3 and New Vegas, and ruin any kind of role playing.\n\nThat doesn't mean they can't make a half decent game because of it though. I do have fun in this game still, and its fun to go through and play again. Setting expectations high, plus the hype train being derailed is why I've given this a do not recommend. Plus the shooting's fun but boring after seeing the umpteenth goul zig zagging your shots, it gets old.\n\nI personally can't enjoy Fallout 4 like I used to when I there was stuff to do, I keep trying to find ways to justify my purchase by trying to laugh at any and all memes, arguing with friends about why it sucks and why it's the best thing since sliced bread, being dissapointed while watching videos of buggyness. The game is such a joke at this point, and laughing at it just hurts, seriously.\n\nTrying not to be too harsh, but lets get into it.\n\nRemoval of RPG elements\nIt does nothing the previous 5 games did right, with skills missing entirely, reparing mechanics gone, skill checks, which by the way I can't believe fans gloss over all of these because it's Bethesda, and they can do nothing wrong. They literally took the core mechanic of the previous games, which everybody loved and praised, then ripped it out for kicks, and garbaged out a terribly written plot that honestly belongs in a cyber punk themed game. Like I get it's set in the future, but apparenly it's set so far into it you have robots that emulate human behavior to a  T.\n\nStory? Yeah right\nBethesda hand holds the player to their "role" which isn't even governed by the player, it's predetermined by Bethesda. I was going to mention Fallout 3, but that game is pretty much the same in terms of story. You are generic model american citizen that saves the day no matter what, and you are always good and never take credit for anything because you are supposed to be the everyman/woman.\n\nExample of that:\n\nFallout 4 you play a middle aged parent who has to  find  their kid in the wasteland.\n\nFallout 3 you are (cannonically) a 19 year old who has to  find  their parent in the wasteland.\n\nThe roles are literally just flipped.\n\nThe Story is so weak, I can't feel emotions for anybody in this, not Nate/Nora, Shaun. I kinda feel bad for  Kellog since we basically become him while trying to get revenge on him.\n\nMidpoint\nSo much **LEARNED** huh? 7 years away from the Fallout franchise served them well didn't it? They developed very few new gameplay mechanics that weren't already just carbon copies from Fallout 3, ported the exact same engine from Skyrim over, kept the same sound assets from Skyrim even (pot stirring at a food station, electricity sounds).\n\n*Update*\nTake my performance bit with a tank of salt. I found out most of my major performance issues are linked to me having a FX 6300 and a R9 390, FX 6300 doesn't have enough CPU power for the driver overhead of the 390 to be able to keep up, so it bottlenecks my CPU and my performance suffers because of it. Just wanted to update it, as I didn't want to be unfair to Bethesda (god forbid that).\n\nI also underclocked my 390 to be on par with a 380x, so my CPU won't die as fast, and my performance increased, especially after resetting my settings in the crimson control panel.\n\nPerformance and Graphical fidelity\nIn the hub city the game tanks in performance, sometimes running slow because of godrays (which by the way are not optional, they at least have to be on low, off doesn't work), with no mods other than the shadowbooster.ini and .asi installed.  On my R9 390 (8gb card) I get 34 fps staring at Sanctuary and 28 if I glance at Concord, looking at the ground it goes right up to 60.\n\n\nTextures and sound assets are literally re-used from Skyrim, it's so blatently done I had to do a mental double take to hear the electricity sound from Skyrim in Fallout 4. I know I mentioned this two paragraphs back, but it's still worth mentioning again, that textures ARE reused.\n\nUnique Game features?\nThere are no unique weapons, which made Fallout 3 and New Vegas so much more fun exploring, there'd be a sign in New Vegas that was a sledge hammer. In Fallout 4 you get Sniper Rifle that does explosive damage, uses the same ammunition the other rifles use and the rifle itself looks exactly the same. Nothing that stands out, everything is uselessly generic and bland. No paint jobs on weapons, but at least there's SOME customization on power armor. (like 7-8 paintjobs total)\n\nGame mechanics\nShooting is fun, but it gets so stale after the millionth ghoul/raider/super mutant/robo synth that always respawns in that area you passed 5 hours ago. They either die really easily, or manage to avoid your fire long enough to get a hit in. I play very defensivlly so I'm never in the line of fire, but it's happened a couple of times and it's been ok.  At least in Fallout 3, if you cleared that area of enemies, it'd take quite a while for them to come back, so it at least felt like there was progress.\n\nRepair is totally gone, poof, like it doesn't exist in the fourth game. Fallout 3 was VERY excessive in it's repair mechanic that repair was a essential skill to take, and immersion breaking. Fallout New Vegas fixed it, and made the system perfect. Enemies always had something you needed, so it encouraged exploration when there wasn't any reason to before.\n\nBase building is amazing, I've spent hours just making settlments looks cool. The budget is a little limiting, but mods already fixed that right up.\n\nEnd?\nIn truth Fallout 4 ended 100 hours [Vanilla] shorter than it should have, and I've since then gone back to playing MGSV and ESO longer than Fallout 4 ever could have.\n\nSERIOUSLY I've gotten more enjoyement out of Fallout Tactics than Fallout 4.\n\nTL;DR Buy Skyrim, mod it to have guns= Fallout 4\n\nWow I'm a right butt aren't I?\nI'd like to apologize for making a irrational review at first, it was full of anger and dissapointment, and that's mainly from me being so passionate about Fallout, it's story/lore and gameplay. Since then I've gone back to play Fallout 4, and it's really fun sometimes. The performance issues though prevent me from recommending it, otherwise it'd be a half decent game, just like Skyrim.\n\nGECK will come out soon and we'll have another great game on our hands, because just like always, modders will fix what Bethesda refuses to fix or redo on their own dime.","February 9","false","301.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaidi/recommended/377160/","jaidi","JDK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jaidi/","158 products in account","This game had the potential to be so much more. Initially I was totally put-off by the game's heavy focus on the settlement building, as it gave me the impression of being less of an RPG and more of an RTS game. However, a couple months later, I decided to give it a try. It took me nearly a month to finally beat this game, but ironically my opinion of th game has not changed one bit. Some of the biggest gripes I've had:\n\n1. The game still feels and plays like Fallout 3. The inherrent limitations of the ancient GameBryo engine rears its ugly head here as well. Its pretty obvious that it never really played well with the PC architecture and was more favored towards the console hardware, resulting in some strange CPU & FPS spikes downwards, the reasons for which are a complete mystery to me. Other than a fresh coat of paint (DX11), even then the game's visuals look very washed out at some places. To my amazement, the vanilla textures consumed more VRAM than the HD texture I installed later to improve the look of the game !!!!! You can imagine the amount of effort they spent on optimizing this game.\n\n2. Witcher 3 raised the bar of what an RPG experience should be. Sadly, the game packs even lesser content than what Skyrim had to offer. There are very few meaningful and meaty side-quests. Most are repetitive "help this settlement rid of mutants", "help establish a new settlement", "fetch technical documents", "obtain viable bloodsample", blah blah blah. What I found truly disappointing was the game completely failed in post-game quests department. In case you decided to join the institute, there's no meaningful impact of your role in that organization, no high-tech gear to unlock, no improvements or tech available for settlement buildings using institute tech. It was so oppresively empty that I lost all interest in the game after the credits rolled.\n\n3. Abysmal load times: Most game engines have now become almost completely seamless in that the gameworld is continous which greatly helps in the immersion. The interior/exterior loading completely breaks the immersion, not to mention the abysmal loading times even with a top of the line SSD installed. Such sloppy piece of work is simply not acceptable here.\n\n4. Fallout 4 is already quite an expensive game at 60$. But the nerve of Bethesda to go out and increase the price of the post-release content from 30$ to 50$ belies no impression that they want nothing more than your money. I've honestly lost all respect for this once great studio. I will most certainly be cautious before buying their games before release.\n\nTLDR:\n\n1. Gameplay 6/10 ---> plays exactly like Fallout 3 with addition of settlement simulator\n2. Graphics 7/10 ----> Upgrade to a DX11 did not warrant in a visual boost I was hoping for, very muddy and blurry visual presentation\n3. RPG 3/10 ----> Non-existant. No control over how much you wish to improve your stats like in Fallout 3/ New Vegas.\n4. Quests ----> Very lifeless and bland side quests.\n\n\nOverall impression - 5/10","February 28","false","85.9"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","3"

The leveling system is garbage in my opinion, and if you step out of line, you die. You can't even do the whole story in one run if you wanted to because the enemies are a "higher level". I say "higher level" as if it means something more than a number but it doesn't. The biggest difference between a level 5 character and a level 20 character is having slightly different armour and a bigger gun, which somehow means you can now fight deathclaws a hell of a lot easier. Why? who knows. but its frankly wrong to call this game open world, when half of it kills you if you aren't the right level and another third kills you just for not wearing power armour. I get thats the point of Fallout, but developing backstory is no excuse for a lack of effort in gameplay.\nThe characters aren't only poorly written, but also your own character couldn't have been handled worse. Not only are they voiced which really limits the role playing ability, but the dialogue options had no effect on gameplay whatsoever. It's either, be mean, be nice, be cringy or try to outwit them. None of which are correctly handled and affect the story whatsoever. You are also told your backstory. One of the greatest parts of an RPG is being able to create your own backstory everytime you create a new character, which in all fairness isn't a necessity in RPG's where the characters are interesting, but for a game where I might as well be playing in a world full of robots as a robot with the slightest hint of emotion, it really doesn't do it for me. It just doesn't have that feel of freedom which I enjoy in RPG's, as you are just so controlled throughout the game.","June 5","false","25.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","2"

It had so much potential to be great, and it would be great if only it worked properly. Right from the day it launched, there were bugs and glitches that made gameplay tedious, and yet I soldiered on because the actual game was fun when it worked. Unfortunately, the more I played, the worse things got. Save files continuously became corrupted. Characters would get stuck in objects or become incommunicable. Many quests can't be completed for one reason or another. Companions would lie on the ground for no reason and refuse to move. The most common cause of death in The Commonwealth is when you unexpectedly rocket into the upper atmosphere and then fall back to earth. There's a delay when switching weapons that can leave you without a weapon for as long as ten seconds or more. Base building is next to impossible because you can't move at all if you want to use a mouse and keyboard. Speaking of keyboards, good luck trying to rebind keys because many of them are hardcoded. The list goes on and on and on.\n\nI decided to wait a month or two to allow some time for Bethesda to patch the game, but things only got worse. The bugs and glitches are still present. Some of the keys can be rebound now, but the same patch also removed the ability to rebind hotkeys. I haven't been able to try the last couple of patches at all because my game crashes every time I try to load a save state or start a new game. I've tried every fix I could find and nothing works (and no, I don't have any mods installed).\n\nThe most baffling part about all of this is that many of these problems have plagued every single Bethesda game that I have played, though to a much lesser extent. The fact that the company has failed to address these issues for over a decade is ridiculous. Fallout 4 could have been one of the best games I've played, but it's unfinished.\n\nTL;DR: Could be a good game, but it's rendered unplayable by the fact that there are more bugs than an ant supercolony.","May 7","false","121.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"

I personally am dissapointed in this game.\n\nBethesdas installment of Fallout before Fallout 4, Fallout 3, had a lot of RPG elements more than 4.   Speech checks, skillpoints, taking the diplomatic way out instead of mindlessly killing all  Gone in 4.\n\nIntelligence as fallout knows it is gone.

(workshop)\n\nIn Fallout 3 you had major cities you entered to figure out more about the world, megaton, the boat etc.\nIn Fallout 4 you build the major cities. It's harder to figure out more about the world.\n\nThis game is basically Far Cry: Post atomic Boston.\n\n\nAll in all to conclude my rant.\n\nFallout 4 is a great shooter game.

The thing in this game that is literally screaming this was rushed is the story. A half cobbled together mess that at times makes little to no sense like an elementary school play where the kid realizes at the last second they never read the script as they are pushed out onto the stage. We have a painfully jarring mess of a story. But Drake, you might argue okay the base story is pretty weak! There are other parts that are okay, right? Not really, admittedly there are a few quest lines I did honestly enjoy, then brought to a screeching halt that is the story lines for the various "organizations" which they really aren't because you don't even have to build up a trust with them, they just welcome you on in and give you the full run of everything, because reasons? And then these quests have literally been ripped straight out of an MMO. Fetch quests? Check! Kill "x" enemy? Check! Clear out "x" area? Check! Well gosh, we really saved a lot of money by not paying people to actually design any legitimate quests and just pocketing the money! Bravo for you Bethesda. There is a lot I'm willing to handwave for Bethesda but this, I'm absolutely unwilling to let slide. Every game of theirs tend to have a least a decent story line that I can sit down and say, okay, was this passable? This is a garbled mess of a story.\n\nNow I won't be totally negative on this game, are there aspects improved? Yes! Core gamplay mechanics such as shooting has been drastically improved upon! I'm a little annoyed on the insanely short range on guns as after a certain point the damage drops off incredibly fast, I'm not sure what rifle struggles firing 100 yards but I'm not sure I want to use it in real life as that is a sad rifle. Build your own weapon is decently fun as it lets you tweak a weapon to fit your desires...then it back fires again. MMO-itis kicks back in, all enemies that spawn are slightly random in nature and sometimes have a chance to have the title of "legendary" which tacks on some random special power to them...huh almost like Diablo... and they will 100% drop a random piece of gear that has some special unique power. This was a horrible idea and some of the special powers feel so crowbarred in it feels as the developers were playing Borderlands right before they started developing the weapons, a healing Fatman? Really? REALLY? Not to even mention unique weapons are for the most part scrapped, they're still around but instead they are just legendaries with a forced spawn location, visibly they look like standard weapons. Sorry, I went back to being negative again so quickly.\n\nThen the cobbled together mess that is the perk system. The crafting system is so ingrained in the game you have to burn perks just so you can build upgrades into a weapon though the second you finish upgrading your weapon of choice that will carry you through a huge portion of the game you'll unlikely touch them ever again. Building desirable settlement items also require you to burn more perk points but if you're doing that it means you actually care about the settlement system in Minecraft, I mean Fallout. Sorry, I bumped my head and got the games confused as did the developers apparently.\n\nThe game has a lot of promise but with a rubbish story, rubbish weapon system and Minecraft system they just had to shove in I honestly cannot advise this game. Unless they put out a DLC called "Sorry" that fixes the story, the rest I can handwave and go "well at least the story was entertaining".","May 8","false","233.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It had so much potential to be great, and it would be great if only it worked properly. Right from the day it launched, there were bugs and glitches that made gameplay tedious, and yet I soldiered on because the actual game was fun when it worked. Unfortunately, the more I played, the worse things got. Save files continuously became corrupted. Characters would get stuck in objects or become incommunicable. Many quests can't be completed for one reason or another. Companions would lie on the ground for no reason and refuse to move. The most common cause of death in The Commonwealth is when you unexpectedly rocket into the upper atmosphere and then fall back to earth. There's a delay when switching weapons that can leave you without a weapon for as long as ten seconds or more. Base building is next to impossible because you can't move at all if you want to use a mouse and keyboard. Speaking of keyboards, good luck trying to rebind keys because many of them are hardcoded. The list goes on and on and on.\n\nI decided to wait a month or two to allow some time for Bethesda to patch the game, but things only got worse. The bugs and glitches are still present. Some of the keys can be rebound now, but the same patch also removed the ability to rebind hotkeys. I haven't been able to try the last couple of patches at all because my game crashes every time I try to load a save state or start a new game. I've tried every fix I could find and nothing works (and no, I don't have any mods installed).\n\nThe most baffling part about all of this is that many of these problems have plagued every single Bethesda game that I have played, though to a much lesser extent. The fact that the company has failed to address these issues for over a decade is ridiculous. Fallout 4 could have been one of the best games I've played, but it's unfinished.\n\nTL;DR: Could be a good game, but it's rendered unplayable by the fact that there are more bugs than an ant supercolony.","May 7","false","121.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","0"
