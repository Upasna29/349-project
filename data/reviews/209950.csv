"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197977748915/recommended/209950/","76561197977748915","Ooops","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197977748915/","591 products in account","Triple Town makes an excellent first impression. It’s a unique take on the match-3 genre that also gives it a colony/city building twist (only in flavour, though. It plays nothing like a city simulation). The graphics are super-ultra-kawaii-cutie-koochy-koochy-boo-boo. And while it has no music, Triple Town is also host to mega-adorable sound effects: bears make little grunts and citizens will come out of their buildings to talk gibberish with each other.\n\nOn Mobiles, these great impressions don’t last. On those platforms, the game advertises itself as free-to-play, but is actually not. If you want to play more than a limited number of turns per day, you have to pay a one-time fee of about $4. Triple Town developers have also devised other means to suck your money, by selling in-game currency, or cosmetic improvements. For what is ultimately a simple match-3 game disguised as free-to-play entertainment, the bill can therefore quickly inflate. Especially as the game is designed to make you want to trade your real cash against the in-game currency.\n\nFor you see, the in-game currency you earn at the end of a session, or from your meta-game buildings, is incredibly small when compared to the costs of the items from the in-game shop. It can literally take several hours before you can buy anything remotely useful.\n\nOn PC, where the game will cost you money upfront ($10, outside of sales), you of course get unlimited turns from the start, and there is no built-in real money micro-transaction. That doesn't mean that you get everything the mobile version has to offer against your initial investment. Oooh no… Instead, many things are forever out of your reach: no cosmetic upgrade and no graphical themes for you! And you’d be wrong to think that the absence of real-money micro-transaction means a better balance between rewards and item costs.\n\nI know that all those optional extras (graphical themes, in-game shop…) can be ignored, no matter how distastefully they serve the developer’s business model. But the fact is that the core game quickly shows its limits too. There is just not enough variety to sustain lasting fun. Game after game, you’ll be doing the same things with the same elements. Getting better only means that a game lasts more turns, not that you reach a further stage. There are several levels to select at the start of the game, but the difference is limited to the size of the starting grid or the frequency of bear appearances. Depending on your tolerance for repetitiveness, Triple Town will start feeling tiresome after two to five hours.\n\nConclusion: Triple Town is built on a promising twist of the match-3 formula, with limited but cute audio-visual assets. Its mechanisms are however too limited to provide lasting appeal. Add to that a misleading and greedy micro-transaction scheme on the mobile versions, or limitations to the PC version features, and you get a casual game that is very hard to recommend. There are many match-3 games on the market that are polished, provide variety and are honest about how they want your money, like “Bejeweled 3” and “4 Elements”, to name just a few. You should play those instead.","November 30, 2013","false","15.0"," 227 of 283 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","227","283","0","1"

You all have a right to your opinions, thats why we need a thumb in the middle, to show people have looked and  given it some time and thought. We need the traffic light thumbs. Anyway thank you.

Players place objects like grass, bushes and trees in a 6x6 grid. When three of the same object touch, they merge into a single new "leveled up" structure, earning players more points and freeing up valuable real estate. Three trees become a house, three houses an estate, three estates a mansion, and so-on.The better a player plans, the longer their round will last. Play it right and you'll perfectly line up three mansions & wrack up big points. But one mistake can lead to churches, houses and other structures littered around the field, making it tough to progress.Triple Town is perfectly tuned – any time things are beginning to look too dire a wild card crystal or object-deleting robot comes up, allowing the round to continue.Triple Town's core matching gameplay is extremely addictive, but the package itself is brought down by its lack of depth and options.Triple Town would be better off if it were sold like a standard puzzle game and included a few more options. However, if you are a casual gamer, looking for something easy to play when idle, which doesn't require fast reflexes or a lot of thought, this is a game you should try.","October 4, 2014","true","27.0"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","0"

But instead of items disappearing when you get a match, they merge into a single new higher quality or bigger item, e.g. from bushes to trees, and thus you build up your town from a few scattered plants to castles and cathedrals. There's also a permanent capital city you can work on over many games, adding some replay value from the desire to upgrade that as much as possible. This is a great game to play while you're doing something else on your PC like watching a movie. To be clear, it's a good game, but I can't recommend it for ten dollars, when it's basically a casual mobile game. I got it in a bundle and paid very little for it. It's worth getting during a big sale, maybe for a buck or two. So I recommend it, just not at this price.","June 1, 2015","false","99.6"," 34 of 47 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","34","47","0","1"

I like "connecting three items in a row" games (7 wonders, puzzle quest, etc.). And in this one you connect 3 and create something new. Cool. It is. And it is very addicting, nice cartoony looking game, with funny, anime-ish bears roaming wild :) But, it has no end game. So, after completing a few of sane achievements (some are just way out of average player league) you have nothing to do and you have no campaign or challenges to complete. You can just play the same game over and over again. Though it is addictive and you start to feel an itch to play one more time (maybe this time i will be able to reach some advanced buildings or even castles.. no, same sh*t, cornered by ninja bears, no items you need, etc.). But after playing for 15-20 minutes you just start to feel you are wasting your time. It is just another time killing junky from the mobile world. Nice looking. But it doesn't give you some sort of achievement or completion feeling, which i usually want from a game.","November 19, 2014","false","7.5"," 32 of 46 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","32","46","2","0"

Gameplay consists of dropping down items on a playing field to build up match-3 combos and get bigger and bigger chunks of points. Good combos can be rewarded with items to use in the overworld, where you again match things to get combos and build more and more...for no reason other than to do it, really. Like I said, blatantly an iOS game designed to addict you into doing things and dropping money to make doing that easier, though the PC port features no microtransactions.\n\nThe game also features a few presets of modifiers like field size, lakes, and the presence of types of bears (which try to block you from placing blocks but can be trapped and combined to make large amounts of points) to mix things up, though I feel it would be much more fun to have control over each individual modifier as well and build your own custom game types. Overall I enjoyed it, though I think it'd be a stretch to call it a good game. Pick it up for 75% off sometime and you can probably get your money's worth out of it.","November 26, 2013","true","7.3"," 26 of 37 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","26","37","0","0"

I don't really think of it as a "match 3" game, because even though you do match 3 things to create a better a thing that takes up less space so that you can create more bigger things, there is more strategy than luck involved, since you choose where to place each thing. It's simple to understand and get into, and I find it pretty soothing. I enjoy it, and at the same time, it's something I can sort of mindlessly play while I'm on the phone, or while I'm getting ready to go to sleep, etc. I'm not especially good at it, mind you, but I do enjoy it a lot. It's currently my go-to game when I'm not sure what I really want to do, and I wind up sticking with it longer than planned every time, but it's also fine for when I'm only going to have a very few minutes to play, because I can exit the game super quickly and it's saved automatically.","September 7, 2015","true","432.9"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","10","12","2","0"

And while it may be easy to play, it is incredibly hard to net high scores in the game.\n\nYou have a basic grid on which a randomized series of items are situated, the items you place are randomized.  You must link together at least three items of a kind in a vertical or horizontal chain, these chains can zig-zag and connect together a great many items, merging them into the next item up in quality of the same item base.  The three base unit types you have are Rocks, Bears, and Plants.  These three base units cannot be merged together, this leads to a conflict in placing each item as you must try to set up future placements without any foreknowledge of items to come,\n\nThe puzzle element itself is enjoyable and challenging, it will function as an enjoyable time sink if you let it.  There is also an external element of resource collection and island build up.  This is all to obtain game altering items which can allow you to place whatever you need whenever you need it in a pinch - generally not worth doing until you have a great many of them and are going to attempt a long game.\n\nIt is fun, but it is frustrating how you can often end up with a string of items you don't want which will end up killing you.","March 26, 2015","true","46.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","10","13","0","0"

This can become quite tricky the more items you have on a map since once you run out of space to place objects the level is over. When you upgrade an object you get points for it, naturally the more advanced an upgrade is, the more points you get. You can use those points to upgrade your town, which is the hub from where you access the randomly generated levels. The town's buildings generate items that will help you during the regular levels. The bigger and better your town becomes, the more and better items you will get.\n\nThe problem with the game is that there is no goal. No special challenges, nothing to achieve other than endlessly upgrading your town. It's the same thing over and over, and that felt rather pointless to me. You could try to get the best possible upgrade of an object (there is even a Steam achievement for it), but for that you need a lot of special items, and you can only obtain those by upgrading your town and collecting more money. That means you need to grind for dozens, if not hundreds of hours and all you get for it is a Steam achievement.\n\nImo this would be a decent time killer for mobile platforms, but there are simply far better puzzle games on PC to waste your time with Triple Town.","September 26, 2014","false","6.6"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","10","14","0","0"

If you want a family friendly game, this one absolutely fits. Even as annoying as the ninja bears are, they're still adorable.

That is a virtue I love since I don't want to invest myself in a game all the time yet I can challenge myself if I want to.\n\n✘ It can be frustrating.\n\nThis game relies heavily on random items that you get and have to put on the map/level. If you get a bad combo, it can potentially end the round. You can buy items in the store however they can be expensive (with in-game coins, not real currency) and there's a limit to how many of each item you can buy per round.\n\n✘  There isn't diversity in level design.\n\nThe game is still cute however the maps are all pretty much the same. Though some have lakes while others have none, they can all look alike, and thus appear fairly bland.\n\n✘ I do wish there were maps of different sizes.\n\nAll the maps/levels are the same size, though some have less space with lakes and rivers in the way. If this game were ever updated or a sequel made, I would appreciate if there were more diversity in the size of the towns.

No, don't stop reading!  It's not as bad as the typical phone game ported to Steam.\n\nFrom the screenshots you might think this is a typical match 3 casual game.  And it is, but not like Bejeweled or other games like that.  Triple Town is all about the strategy of placement.   The main playing field (there are several variations, not just one field) is a big grid with some items already placed.  Each turn you get an item like grass or bush and you have to place it somewhere on the grid.  When you place a grass next to two other grasses they instantly combine to form a bush.  Get three bushes together and they form a tree.  Three trees form a small red house.  Three red houses form a bigger house.  3 of those form a mansion.  3 mansions form a castle.  3 castles form a sky castle.  So you can see how you can quickly run out of room.  The items you get are not totally random, there must be a variable to give a greater chance for grass and bushes since you get those the most.\n\nYou do get random items to help, like the blue crystal which acts like a wild card to instantly make a match of any 2 items you already have on the grid.  And you can buy items with the gold coins you get (this is where the microtransactions were in the mobile version).  Like buy a bush or tree for a few coins.  But I like to save my coins for the other part of the game: your town.\n\nWhen you run out of room on the game field you go back to your town.  It's actually an island.  You build items here that use the same match 3 thing as the field but for buildings.  Like, 3 fields make a big field, 3 of those make a bale of wheat (or whatever it is), 3 of those make a store house, 3 of those make something else (I've forgotten).  There's farming, gold mining, and defense (cannons, towers, etc), Though you don't get attacked, it's just for show.  This is where I choose to use the coins I earn in the matching fields.  You can buy extra squares of land to add on to your island, extra matching items like fields or fences.  Or even a crane to move an item to a different location.  And once you're rolling in the dough (have lots of coins to spare) you can even buy decorations like letters, statues, and stuff like that to personalize your town.\n\nI'm sure by now you can imagine the microtransactions and how much money could be spent (wasted!) on stuff in this game.  Which brings me to my point in the beginning, why I hesitate to write a positive review.  Normally I am against microtransactions.  But I love the cute graphics in this game and the strategy involved.  The bears are especially cute and the way the villagers go "eek" and run when the bears growl.\n\ntldr:\n\nPorted mobile game that had microtransactions\nCute graphics\nDeep strategy in placing items\nBuild your town, lots of personalization available\nBut it takes forever to get enough coins\nGet it on sale","January 2","true","84.7"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

(not that I've found what's at "the end") The reward of expanding the town and building higher level teirs dosn't seem to reward other then basic building blocks to get to higher teirs. The limit in the stores on buying items is annoying, and you'll play for a few days just to afford the crystals and wait for them to re stock.\n\nThe graphics and sound fit the game well, and there is nothing wrong with the game, I just don't think the end game is worth it.","September 25, 2014","false","4.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

This game has sucked up chunks of my life (especially weekends, now that they offer world wide tournaments on mobile) and I regret none of it. I will say that my favorite game mode (in which you have 2 minutes to build as big of a city as possible) is missing from the PC version yet available in mobile, which seems rather odd.

At first, I was satisfied that a traditionally free to play, pay to win style Facebook game was for sale as a standalone, so you wouldn't be limited but stupid time or energy constraint mechanics. I also originally enjoyed the game for a few hours, with it's charming art style, and it's simple, but strategically challenging gameplay - it's immensely smarter than "click here to harvest resources and place objects". You of course, place objects and harvest resources in your main kingdom, but mostly for the sake of progression and isn't the meat of the gameplay . My problem with the game is that the dev didn't qute address the fact that this game was purchased - now your only source of coin income is constantly replaying towns, which make it an EXTREME grind to improve, grow, and customize your kingdom. It also feels that tthe game is stingy with giving you higher level placables (trees, huts, churches) and gives you a ton of grass and the occasional bush that more often than not, comes at a bad time. This game could really use a placable that lets you move objects and/or make the undo button less expensive and have more or unlimited uses...after all, the whole point of limited uses was to force players to pay for coins, but I'VE ALREADY PAID FOR THE GAME!!! I do have a respect and fondness for TripleTown, but the stingy randomness of placables and no compensation for the fact that players paid for the game versus paying peacemeal (HOW ABOUT A HUGE COIN REWARD OR SOMETHING?!) made me uninstall this.","August 28, 2013","true","3.3"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

Combine three bushes and they'll turn into a tree. Create and match three trees and it'll become a house and so on and so forth. It's all about the points and the coins. It's quite addictive, trust me.\n\nThe coins can be used to upgrade your hub, a place where you can pick a gameplay mode (sort of) before playing/ Or it can be used to buy items, like extra houses or bushes. Unfortunately, items are limited so you have to choose wisely. The items are also quite expensive, so buying an item isn't always a good choice.\n\nThe hub is all about creating farms, mines and other buildings. See it as some sort of mini-game. Except you can't really mess things up here. You'll be able to collect rewards from your buildings every couple of hours. Rewards that'll help you when playing the 'real' game. The developers haven't thought things through with the time limit though, because earning coins is kind of slow and tedious and waiting for several hours before being able to collect a reward could make people lose interest (more quickly than intended).\nBut I heard it might be changed in the near future, so let's just hope for the best.\n\nAnyway, Triple Town is easily one of the my favorite casual games.\n\n[Rating: 79/100]","December 20, 2012","true","13.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

These objects can evolve into others by making appropriate matches (e.g. three Grasses make a Bush, three Bushes make a Tree...three Trees make a Hut...and there's more after that! ;-D). Matching more than three items, or mathcing certain high-end items will gift you different goodies that improve your score or other parts of the game! What you're given to place each time is random, but you can place these objects in any free space you want (with the objects melding where you place the last item in the cluster), so there's more strategy involved than the average Match 3.\n\nBesides building materials, there are helpful items, like the Crystal, which is a wild card that completes matches (often important for much easier matching of high-end items!), but placing them without a Match makes a Boulder. Match three Boulders with the Crystals, however, and you'll get a Mountain that contains a Treasure Chest that contains a random prize. To get the Chest you need the Imperial Robot, which also lets you get rid of an unwanted item (most items penalize your score when destroyed, though...keep that in mind).\n\nBut watch out, there are Bears and Ninja Bears who'll try to impede your building! If you can trap a Bear or use an Imperial Robot on him, he turns into a Tombstone, and if you can trap three or more bears, the resulting Tombstones turn into a Church, and three of those make a Cathedral, and three of those make a Treasure Chest. Ninja Bears jump around and mostly can only be stopped by the Imperial Robot.\n\nThere are more items such as Fortune Cookies (which tell you the next five items that you'll be given to use), and Crates (which let you temporarily stash an item on the map), but these are gotten through the Shop and the Captiol City (more on those later!).\n\nIf you can't place something in a good spot right away, there's a little space set aside on each level where you can save an item, hopefully for a better use later in your game.\n\nWhen you do run out of space (hopefully later rather than sooner!), your score is finalized, and you win some Coins and Capitol City materials (more on those in a bit!). If you need to stop playing a level, you can pick up where you left off later. There is no limit to how many times you can play a level; if you start a new level after finishing one, a new one is rolled for you!\n\nThere are six different kinds of levels: "Standard colony" (self-explainitory), "City on a lake" (actually, it's a "Standard colony" with a small lake in the center), "Peaceful Valley" (island with no Bears!), "A dangerous forest" (island with lots of Bears!), "City on an island" (small island). You can also revisit the Tutorials that you play the first time you launch the game, if you wish. You visit these from the Capitol City hub, which you build and improve mainly by making matches, too! You'll mainly get the materials from playing the game. The highest level buildings in your town will gift you materials and items everytime you earn so many points at a time in levels!\n\nThere is also a shop system that lets you buy building objects and helpful items with coins that you win in-game, mainly by completing levels. There are two different shops; one for the colonies, and one for the Capitol City. The colony shop lets you buy materials and items, but they're limited in supply, and replenish after so many turns. But if you've got the money, they can help you keep building for longer! The Capitol Shop lets you buy materials, Decorations, Expansion Tiles, and a Crane that lets you pick up and move an item to a better spot. These will cost you, though, so build some colonies!\n\nThere are personal High Score lists for each level, and 10 Achievements to earn. Recently, support for Steam's new Trading Card program has been added, too.\n\nOverall, this is a great and different Match 3 game! Definitely check it out! :-D","June 7, 2013","true","101.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It is simple match three turn-based game, but the last item you place becomes the next tier up. So three bushes = 1 tree, 3 trees = 1 house, so on and so forth. It becomes a game about managing the precious space you have, and there is something very satisfactory and rewarding about putting in that one last piece and watching your board transform into a new thing you haven't seen before.\nExcept the elusive Triple Castle. Curse you! I always lose before I get to that stage.\n\nSo, there are several maps to the game. There’s the main town, were the buildings you place give you resources for the other maps - little extra things you can place down to match three when you're in a tight spot. Then there are a few maps with different flavours - one where there are lots of aggressive bears who walk around and get in the way of your plans, smaller maps with no bears where you can test your building skills. It's nice to be able to switch between them when you get stuck, and also nice to pop into your town and see what's up there.\n\nYou also gain currency when you 'complete' a map which can go towards buying things to help you in future runs, so that's pretty cool.\n\nAll in all a deceptively cute casual game that can be a little hard at times. If you're looking to play something relaxing when you have a little down time, this is perhaps my favourite puzzle game to recommend. It's very much like Combine or 2048 but more in-depth, lovable, and appealing to the eye.","June 22, 2014","true","84.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Very clean art design, great thematic flavour all added in with "just one more round" gameplay.  The dual layered nature of the game with your home island (persistant and generates resources for use in the colony games and building the main island) and with the colony games (the main tile laying match puzzle strategy portion) leads to a much greater depth of play than is first apparent.\n\nYes, in the beginning the rewards seem paltry compared to the prices at the store.  However, I found that with proper planning you will use very little of the items in the store.  On your home island you will most often use the crane to move a mistakenly places merged level 3 or 4 tile.  Get to planning ahead to avoid this!  Save the 20K gold for the 5 tile expansion.\n\nDo not be afraid to spend gold on the colony boards!!  Bushes are cheap at 150 gold and get you out of a pile of trouble.  Trees are a steal at 400 and can turn an average score into a mega score.\n\nSpend some relaxing fun time discovering all this game has to offer, stretch your brain and enjoy!\n\n9/10","March 11, 2014","true","70.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Phorrum/recommended/209950/","Phorrum","Phorrum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Phorrum/","249 products in account","Triple Town is a port of a Facebook/Mobile game. It's a match 3 game where you have the goal of building a small settlement in a new land. Other than that there's not much more story to speak of. You can play for a few minutes or an hour, however long you like.\n\nBeing a port of a Facebook/Mobile game, my first fear was that it would retain certain freemium or free 2 play features like grinding or paying for in-game currency. This fear really doesn't hold and I found myself really enjoying this small joyful timewaister.\n\nIt's a match three game. So say you start off by matching three Grass pieces together, which forms a bush. If you then get three bushes together it forms into a tree, three trees into a house, three houses into a town hall and so on. If you combine more than three you gain bonus points and a chance or higher chance for a structure for your hub world. Placement takes place on a grid system, the main antagonists being rocks, water and bears. Rocks can be removed by an item you can be given a turn like you can be given a grass or a bush or a tree. Water is there to stay and bears will hop to open spaces adjacent to them each turn and turn into tombstones when there are no open spaces for them to migrate to. Three tombstones turns into a church, three churches to a chapel, I think you get the idea!\n\nMaking matches and completing levels/settlements earns you coins. Coins can be used to buy items to be used in levels or in your hub world. The hub world follows the same rules as the levels. You gain resources that you place, match three and they become a better version of that resource. You use the hub world to embark on different level types like levels without bears or without water. The hubworld also allows you to personalize it a little. It's clear on the facebook and mobile versions this is where it would cost you actual money, but here it is just based on your actual progress, not income. And it is not necessary or made in a way where you are forced to grind.\n\nTriple Town is not completely devoid of strategy, letting you save at least one "piece" for later use, allowing special items that remove rocks or other structures on the level. But This never gets stressful with its adorable art style. It can be as casual or as in depth as you want, with the only limiter being the luck of the draw each turn and how far you plan ahead.\n\nIf you want an adorable, uplifting time-relief, you can't find a much better game than this. I've normally played this before heading out somewhere, played this on my laptop, played while I was downloading something or while watching TV.\n","March 7, 2014","true","4.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The time attack mode is replaced with a capital city where you can build farms, mines, and military structures for bonuses and cash. You also have a persistent inventory now, instead of using tiles as soon as you buy them. Overall, it feels like a slightly more PC-oriented game. My verdict: buy it, but wait for a sale. $10 is a bit too much for an (admittedly robust) match-three game.","June 6, 2013","true","3.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And the design is decent, and the very first impression is rather good, but.... there's nothing going on. Like literally. No sense of progression whatsoever, no story, no new levels, zones and themes\settings to aim for. The mobile version had themes, by the way. But here it's just the same old tiles to combine on the same few tiny zones in order to grind coins. And then grind for more coins. Oh, and have I mentioned grind for coins? The only reward for that grinding are the extra tiles for the 'permanent city', grind for 3 woods - get a tile of fence, or go for 'aesthetics' and put yourself a giant(=tile-sized) bear statue or a 'F'-shaped bush.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I was not expecting  miracles from a match3 mobile port. I don't have anything against raw and pure timekillers. Hell, my playtime for Bejeweled or Zuma are actually significantly higher than I would care to admit.  But this game?

It really is one of those one more turn games - easy to pick up from where you left off and leaves you with an overwhelming desire to beat your best score.\n\nIt is a match 3 game at it's core, but with a very clever aspect to it. You match 3 building blocks to create a single block that is "one up". For example combine 3 grass tiles to make a bush and then combine 3 bushes to make a tree and so on. There is also the added difficulty of bears spawning on your grid which, put simply you need to kill. That's right, a cutesy game where you need to block in animals, which converts them to gravestones, which, staying with the theme of the game can be combined into a church.\n\nThe only downside of this game is that it is probably more suited to a mobile platform as a bit of the "pick up and play" aspect is lost on PC. That's not to say that you won't sink hours into it, just simply that your gaming sessions will likely be a bit longer (which is no bad thing) and you won't be sat on the toilet as you match 3.\n\nDefinitely a game I'd recommend but watch out for the ninja bears.","June 19, 2015","true","9.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

That said, I'd say that since buying it, I've probably sunk 10-15 hours into actually playing this game. I played for a good 5-10 hours after purchasing it two and a half years ago. Got caught up in a bunch of other games, and came back to it last week, determined to get the last 2 or 3 achievements, and put in at least another 5 hours.\n\nThat might seem like a lot for what deceptively looks like such a simple game, but the crux of the matter is as follows: 1) I was determined to beat it. For neurotic achievement hunter me, that meant, another perfect game. 2) It takes a lot of planning, like playing a chess game and trying to think a dozen moves ahead. I sometimes found a scratch pad and pencil helpful for planning things out. 3) The effing bears! And lastly, 4) This game is more than a little bit addictive. You tell yourself, nope, just going to finish this building and I'm done for the night. And some bear gets in the way of a building you've been working on for the past 5 minutes, and somehow, you've got a new game going because you know you can beat it this time.\n\nI don't know that it's something that I would have shelled out $10 for. But I'm stingy like that. Having paid 3.99 for it, I find I'm okay with the price to time played/enjoyment ratio. The last couple of achievments are hard, but there's a pretty great guide in the community hub for it. In the end, I probably won't play this game again, or at least not any time soon, but I don't by any means regret the purchase.","December 30, 2015","true","80.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Wrapped in a super cute art style, it is one of the most clever and surprising games I've played in a long time.\n\nEasy to learn, hard to master is the best way to describe the gameplay. Instead of the traditional removal of gems, stones, or Chuzzles, TripleTown has you placing various tiles in order to advance up the food chain so to speak. Though this sounds simple on paper, once the board starts filling it becomes an incredible challenge to keep the game going, and really makes you have to think with every move you make.\n\nIt only took one round for the uncomplicated, but all the same engadging mechanics to have me completely addicted to building my towns, beating my hi-score, and getting rid of those horrid Ninja Bears! Don't let the casual label turn you off, TripleTown is much more than at first meets the eye, and any puzzle fan should absolutely check it out.","June 28, 2013","true","4.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

This game is incredibly tiny thus in my opinion not worth the assigned price and therefore I cannot recommend it. It has 4 map layouts (with/without bears/lakes) and there are no "levels". The more you play the more money you earn so eventually you can buy single-time-use items to help yourself on these four layouts. You can strive to master this game but it will require a lot of time. If you look at the forums you can find the developers post announcing that there will be no future updates (unlike the mobile version of this game) because of their limited resources.","October 8, 2015","false","18.0"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

You start out in a barren kingdom with few people to govern. The whole time, you are invading savage lands which may house natives or their animal gods. Your job is to forcefully remove the natives and replace them with citizens of your own. Unfortunately, the lands are unable to support large populations, so a lottery system is put in place to force those who are unable to pay the rising rent, to swim to other lands and risk drowning. The fearsome wargods are hellbent on keeping you from developing the island that sends supplies back home. They can be dealt with by mechanized infantry or by crushing them. Doing so enables the spread of a proper religion, which provides growth and materials to be sent home.","September 26, 2013","true","19.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

I first stumbled upon this game via Android, during a more basic age for Triple Town. Now, in the desktop version, you're faced with additional modes inclluding city management and new "arenas." The idea is simple, connect three of the same type of object to upgrade them into one new one. Connect three of the new objects to upgrade those into yet another upgraded object. And.. Continue. In the meantime, terrible bears and ninja bears appear to block your open tiles, as they move between each of your object placements. To remove them? Trip them inside your objects to them into gravestones. Guess what- Connect three gravestones and you get a church, and upgrade those, too! No Triple Town experience is ever the same, and if you're a fan of puzzle games, this game definitely screams for your attention.","November 26, 2013","true","4.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I got a Steam Key because I bought $20 worth of gold coins. Yes, I'm well aware that this is more than the purchase price here. I don't begrudge giving money to smart and deserving developers. This really is a fantastic and innovative game at heart.\n\nAs much as I love this game, it's got some very irritating flaws. It's fun as it is frustrating. The biggest irritation by far is the fact that you need to grind for gold to get good scores. I've finally accumilated 10K gold, the minimum needed to try for a top score. This is really insane.

A bit like a turn-based version of Tetris, hence strategic and not dependent at all on reflexes. I played it previously on Android, but was put off by the in-game purchase mechanism. The version on Steam seems free of that annoyance, and includes a number of enhancements I hadn't seen last time I played on my tablet. The game is simple but with almost painfully deep strategy. With no time pressure, you can rack your brains as long as you like.

This lacks depth and relies a little too much on incessantly nitpicking strategy.  Perhaps it'd be more fun if the timer were less aggressive.  As it is, the time limits imposed are a little too stiff, and you never really make it up into the higher tiers, unless you're just one of those savant-type people who is naturally good at these, no practice required.  The important factor here, is that you can get games of this type, for absolutely 100% free, on kong or armor games.  This does not have enough content beyond one of those types of games, to actually recommend PURCHASE of it, much less at a $10 price point.\n\nPS- Stop saying my review isn't helpful, just because you like the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/FelicityNatura/recommended/209950/","FelicityNatura","The Fluffy Assassin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/FelicityNatura/","542 products in account","This is just one of those fun little games where you can sit down during an evening, open it up and relax while playing. It isn't intense gameplay. It's very simple. Match three of one object to make another one. Match three of those. And so on.  Yet, the simplicity doesn't take anything away from the game. However, if you want a high enough score, you have to be strategic in your placements of every object. But if you just want to put things in random places and see what happens, it is possible to get through the game that way too. So if you really don't want to put any effort in, you don't have to.\n\nTriple Town is designed in a way that makes it look a lot like many Facebook games that people get addicted to (or annoyed by). Yet, it separates itself from them because you are not compelled to fork out your hard earned cash to keep playing... because there are no in-game transactions, which makes it aces in my book.\n\nWhat I really like most about the game in addition to the simplicity factor is the soundtrack. The sound of birds. It's like you're sitting out in the middle of a garden on a summer afternoon.\n\nIn short, if you want a game that requires minimal brain power (but rewards you if you put more in) that you can wind down while playing, give Triple Town a go. Just be careful. It's addictive.","September 9, 2014","true","62.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It rewards you for getting better at it, with achievements and in-game rewards for scoring higher points. It makes you want to get good at it, because everything is easier: you get more points, more money, more assets and so forth. And sure, it's a Match 3 but you have an open grid to do whatever you want. Pretty neat. There are even little enemy bears (adorable mean fluffballs) to give you some amount of challenge.\n\nThe cons: It's likely never going to see another update again, so this is the final product - and it's kind of a small shell and a basic game. Is there a quirk of the gameplay you dislike? Too bad. My personal axe to grind, is that it takes wayyy too long to feel like you're making progress in the game. There's a little map you can customize as you earn more points: you build things, and those little buildings generate rewards and points for you. The map is its own ongoing mini-game, the actual 'objective' of Triple Town. It's a neat little system: if it didn't take a thousand years to earn enough money to buy and build anything. I'm at over 100 hours on this thing (don't judge me). I'd expect to be rolling in dough right now, but I'm lucky if I can save up to 10K before having to spend it on something for my little map. So sometimes this map's progress feels like watching paint dry.\n\nIt's a really cute game, though. If you don't get obsessive about these kinds of things, it's super cute to just pick it up for a few minutes at a time as you wish.","October 26, 2015","true","228.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Triple Town aims to reduce the role that luck plays on your game while emphasizing the importance of strategy. As you progress, you'll be forced to think several stages ahead. Say you're building a house; you should know where your last hut needs to go and plan backwards from there. Obviously this can get pretty complicated at the more advanced stages. There are some chaotic elements. Bears can quickly become a nuisance if you don't plan ahead for them. Ninja bears are even worse because they can't be contained like normal bears and can only be killed by filling all tiles on the map or by using a rare item on them. They're also the only thing that can really screw up your game even if you're playing well. There is a map without bears but you'll have fewer tiles to build on. This map is useful for getting the highest achievements. Overall, I highly recommend this. I think it's a must have for any fan of strategy and puzzle games. If I had one comlaint, it's that the Facebook version is (or was, I can't seem to find it anymore) prettier. I do wish they would update the graphics of the version I paid for to match the quality of the free version.","August 26, 2015","true","106.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
