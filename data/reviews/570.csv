This is one of the reasons that   the Dota phenomenon has continued to grow  Dota will have more rage quitting and all chat abuse than any other game. Originating as a fan-made Warcraft 3 modification, Dota was an instant underground hit. After coming to Valve, the original community developers have bridged the gap to a more inclusive   audience  Russia, so that the rest of the world can   experience the same core gameplay, but with the level of polish that only Valve can provide  learn from these ingenious people and become inspired to spread their knowledge with the rest of the world.\n\nGet a taste of the game that   has enthralled millions  will happily teach you fluent russian all for the sweet price of $0.

Since I've been playing dota I've learned to speak russian and spanish, Who needs rosetta stone when you have dota right? The russians are so friendly and have a neat little nickname for americans called "Suukah", I think it means comrade or friend. And the peruvians are so helpful, for instance I was mid as pudge and at the start of the match a peruvian dazzle came mid with me and stayed with for about 11 minutes, He helped me out by taking the last hits and first blood. He said "movimiento ♥♥♥♥", I think it means "I got your back", What a nice guy. Dota is great and all but there are a few problems with some heros, like bloodseeker, Phantom Assassin, Faceless void, And huskar. They need to be buffed, I find them extrememly underwhelmed. Bloodseekers ult cd is just too long and needs to be lowered to ten seconds, Phantom assassin needs a higher crit ratio, faceless needs more evasion and movement speed, and huskar's flaming spear should cost no hp. Oh and there's one other hero needs to be nerfed hard, Bat rider is just too overpowered and unbalanced. I think he has too much hp, and the base should be lowered to 320, also lower his base movement speed to 200. Aside from those few problems dota 2 is the best FPS I have ever played in my life.","July 20, 2015","true","468.3"," 1,126 of 1,351 people (83%) found this review helpful 1,813 people found this review funny","83","126","1","813","60"

I was from HoN for like 2-3 years before Dota 2 was released and tried LoL and actually enjoyed it for a bit but then went back to HoN.\n\nDota 2 is a great game, an awesome game. I really should have thought about spending money on a free game but to hell with it I say. Mechanics are well designed, what makes a hero OP is the player behind it and the team that surrounds it. This is a team game people, so team work is a must (unless you are solo queuing, then you have to carry your garbage of a team but it can be the other way around). Monster gamers are real.\n\nDota 2 has taught me a lot of things, you can only be good at something if you focus on it, learn from mistakes, be aware of your surroundings, trust your instinct, use common sense, trusting on your team to always have your back, believing in your capabilities, always try to be better than you were yesterday, and that..\nTHE COMEBACKS ARE REAL!!!\nThis game bought me and my friends together for lan parties and strengthen our bonds. A mere game that brings people together, not just friends but complete strangers too. Dota 2 is a game that will never be forgotten.\n\nAll in all, I recommend this game to everyone who wants to experience pain, suffering, and torment because at the end, you will come to a sudden realization that things are always bound to get better.\n\nP.S.

Instead of being sarcastic and writing a funny review that jabs at russians, I'm going to tell you how Dota 2 really is at it's core.\n\nIn a nutshell Dota 2 is a great game, but a terrible experience at the same time. You want to keep going back to it, but you also hate to go back. Why? One word: community. Dota 2's community is for the most part rude and hateful (and undeniably filled with russians who refuse to speak any other language than that of their own), sapping the joy out of this otherwise polished and addicting MOBA. It's unfriendly to beginners and the basic mindset is to belittle anyone who makes a mistake. Make one wrong move and you are called a noob right away... at the best of times. Often it's much worse and I would prefer not to go into the details. Sometimes you get a crapstorm of hate and blame even if you haven't actually done anything wrong. Occasionally, though, you come across friendly players, and when that happens, the game is a pure joy to play. However, since the game is 5v5, coming across four nice players at the same time (if you're solo queueing) is a rarity.\n\nWhy then have I played the game for over 2000 hours? The sensation of winning. Your determination to keep playing, despite of the discouraging community, is fueled by the fantastic sensation of a glorious victory. That sweet moment when you see the enemy Ancient blow up and look back on the match, remembering all the plays and teamwork that lead you to victory is ever so gratifying. But even a victory can come with a grain of salt. Many times you have rude teammates that rage in the chat even when your team is winning. There is a mute option, but that doesn't stop the bad manners that extend outside the chat. People can intentionally feed the enemy team, ignore their own team, teamkill with some abilities and just generally be a bad player. It's really frustrating and the worst part is it happens all the time.\n\nGoing ranked doesn't really solve the problem either, at least not completely. Ranked matchmaking is a more serious type of mode in Dota 2 that ranks you based on how well you do and finds opponents of equal skill. It feels much more professional and "tryhardish." Although you meet nice players more often, nothing stops the rude players from jumping over the fence and playing ranked aswell. Having played some matches in ranked, I can say the mode isn't "hate free." I had some of the worst matches in regards to teammates in that mode. Another problem with ranked is that, like I said, it's more "tryhard." Many just want to play the game casually and not have to worry about ranks and the "this is ranked, you better be a damn good player" mentality.\n\nBut don't get me wrong, Dota 2 is a great game in itself and that's why I keep going back to it. The core mechanics are spot on and gameplay flows well. No technical issues to speak of (not counting the occasional missing texture bug or so, of which I have had none myself). Graphics are great and have a subtle water painting type feel to them. All the various spells and abilites look great. The game is very deep and complex with tons of items, skill and item builds and strategies to learn. It can be a bit terrifying to beginners, but once you get the hang of things, it's engaging. All the playable heroes are well balanced (although there is always some debate on a couple specific heroes being "OP") and free to play from the start. That's another thing the game does right. All the heroes are free and playable from the start, unlike Dota 2's undeniably very successful competitor, League of Legends. Dota 2's microtransactions focus on purely cosmetic stuff, which means there are zero "pay to win" elements in the game.\n\nIt really falls unto you to decide whether if you want to suffer the rude community for the sake of playing this brilliant game. If you're one of those people who can just calmly ignore everything rude being said at you, you have a better chance of not finding Dota 2 so terrible. To put it roughly in perspective: Playing Dota 2 is like playing Skyrim, but having someone stand next to you the whole time yelling at you for every mistake you make, calling you a "fooping idiot" every time you miss an arrow or fail a quest objective. Failed to kill Alduin? "Uninstall Skyrim, noob." Don't know how to make dragonbone armor? "Learn to play, tard." It would just completely sap the fun out of your epic adventures, would it not? Sadly that's how Dota 2's community is.\n\nHaving played the game as long as I have, I would say that you are better off not playing Dota 2. The game is fun when you're winning (because people tend to rage less when your team is doing fine), which is 50% of the time (and sometimes not even when you're winning). It isn't the losses that make the game unpleasant, it's the unfriendly people. Often your day will just be worse after playing Dota 2, instead of it cheering you up as games do. People will tell you that Dota 2 is great, but that greatness comes with a price.\n\nDo take in notice that this is all coming from a solo player point of view. This review is meant mainly to those who are likely to play the game alone most of the time and want to know what it's really like, not just the great things. If you have four friends who you can play with on a regular basis, then you're good to go. The game is at it's best when you play with friends and don't have to worry about getting "a stick in the mud" player on your team.\n\nGreat game with bad community.","November 14, 2014","false","150.6"," 3,176 of 3,995 people (79%) found this review helpful 225 people found this review funny","79","176","3","225","264"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mendozacheers/recommended/570/","mendozacheers","Mendozacheers","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mendozacheers/","4519 products in account","Dota 2 is the official sequel to the highly popular mod for Blizzard's Warcraft III, Defense of the Ancients. A mod that has been worked on by many, and therefore it was hard to determind where the rights belong. A lot of legal hocus pocus were going on between Blizzard and Valve last year, and it ended to valve's favor. The Dota name and franchise is now legally a part of Valve, probably thanks to the sneaky acquisition of IceFrog the year before.\n\nDota 2 is a real-time strategy game in the sub-genre called MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena). A genre that has grown rapidly the past few years, with different type of alterations in favor of success. Dota 2 is a close second to being the most popular MOBA, right behind the giant League of Legends. Just like LoL, Dota 2 is gaining success throughout it's competetive e-sport scene, and it's clear that valve is highly pushing it towards the first position. The latest and biggest tournament was The International 2013, which included a total prize pool of over 2.8 million US dollars, which was the biggest prize pool in e-sport history.\n\nGameplay is easy to understand but very hard to master. The map consists of 3 lanes that are constantly being pushed by NPC creeps. You are controlling a hero amongst 4 other in your team, and are fighting against 5 in the opposing team. The goal is to push your heroes and NPC creeps to the enemy base, where you have to destroy the ancient. It sounds pretty easy, but it requires hours upon hours to get a hold of the base mechanics, the more advanced mechanics and the professional mechanics. Plus the over 100 heroes you get to play and face.\n\nAfter 300 hours I have only touched what I call the more advanced mechanics, and I am not even close to professional level. The most experienced players have around 5000 hours of playtime and have spend the majority of their past 3 years to Dota 2. Since the game is Extremely competetive there will be a lot of curse words flying around while you play. These type of games are known for very hostile encounters with other players. There is an optional tutorial that you can take before going out there, beware though - the tutorial does not cover any Russian.\n\nDota 2 might be competetive, extremely enraging and the learning curve is steep as crap, but it is still the game that I have spend the most time playing on Steam (mostly because my collegues and bosses were playing it). Somehow I keep returning to it, so I suppose I am enjoying it. You better have people to play with though, and you better not be good friends - because this game will take your beloved friendship and wipe it's ♥♥♥ with it until you hate each other.\n\nOnly play this if you plan on getting some mental disorder. Time will fly, and you will realize you still suck and people hate you no matter what. It's free so why do you need a review anyway?\n\nTranslations: German","August 21, 2013","true","513.3"," 2,105 of 2,696 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","105","2","0","45"

If that statement is an insufficient description of the game, continue reading.\n\nThis game is not for the casual gamer, this game is for those who have the capability to log in hundreds of hours into a game.\nIf you play this game, I can attest that there will be times you love it and times you just want to break your monitor with your keyboard. I have a few hundred hours into the game and no matter how long you play, no matter what you do, you will encounter someone who will complain about something you're doing poorly or not doing correctly and it may ruin the gameplay for you. I can only recommend this game if you have thick skin or you have friends to play with.\n\nSo here are what I consider the pros and cons of the game:\n\nPros\n-This is a very intricate strategy based game that relies heavily on teamwork and timing.\n\n-Free to play with optional cosmetic costs.\n\n-Gameplay always varies due to each individual hero selection. This, in effect, increases replayability tremendously.\n\n-Wonderful voice actors with interesting dialogue choices by the developer.\n\n-Winning matches in this game often triggers the release of dopamine in the reward center in your brain creating the desire to play more. This in effect causes players to really want to win and may be the trigger of many cons of the game.\n\nCons\n-This game has a steep learning curve, believe me, there is way more to this game than you might think at first glance. Unlike hero customization in League of legends, not all heroes are created equal and not all ward placements are either. It can be a little intimidating to think that your team is already at a disadvantage from the hero selection, but thus is DOTA.\n\n-Secondary to the steep learning curve, games tend to be won or lost by the actions of an individual on either team. This can be ameliorated by steam implementing some sort of "fundamentals of gameplay" video instead of the current lackadaisical tutorial they have. Suffice to say, many new players do not understand that every time their hero is killed by the opposing team, the player loses gold and the other team gains gold. This doubles the impact that each individual has for gameplay.\n\n-Unlike other video game developers, Steam does not region lock. This brings about an unforeseen consequence where individuals from any country can join any server despite having a language preference. You can imagine how difficult it is to create a coordinated cohesive team push when there's a Russian only speaker, Spanish only speaker and a Portuguese only speaker on the US WEST server.\n\n-Blame is a word that is thrown around in this game like the word inequality is thrown around in America. Unfortunately, this is by far the worst aspect of the game. The game community has very little to no interaction prior to gameplay or thereafter and there is no review conversation on what an individual can do to improve in the future. More often than not, an individual will oversimplify the ongoing team loss to 1 action by 1 individual because of time constraints and heated emotions.\n\n-There is no team forfeit vote option in game and often you are sitting there for 10-20 minutes as the other team wastes your time despite securing a victory much earlier.\n\n\nThis review is from personal experience and your gameplay may vary. Of course, if you do meet someone ingame who is a decent person, be sure to commend them at the end of the match for their ingame courtesy.\n\nFinal Rating:\n-Game 9/10\n-Game community 3/10","January 23, 2014","false","614.4"," 503 of 619 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","503","619","0","25"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/steveocappie/recommended/570/","steveocappie","Na`Vi.Ridley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/steveocappie/","141 products in account","I have played Dota 2 for a little over three years now, so I think I am finally ready to give it an in depth review. I gave this game a review back in 2013, but I am going to change that. First of all, I'm going to start by listing off what I like about the game.\n\n::THE PROS::\n\n1) Dota 2 is, obviously, a team game. Playing this game with friends is a really fun experience and can act as a source of really fantastic memories. My point is, if you play this game with a group of four other friends, Dota 2 is probably one of the best options out there.\n\n2) Dota 2 has a fantastic tutorial system and the game is very well designed to accomodate new players. A new player can go from a full AI game to an AI game with 4 other random people to playing a 5v5 online; the transition is really smooth.\n\n3) I have played both League and Dota, and I can honestly say that I think that Dota 2 is much more visually pleasing to look at. A smooth, clean UI makes the game easier on the eyes compared to League's cartoon-y design (which suits some, but not me).\n\n4) Dota has an extremely vast pool of heroes that can be played to suit almost anyone's playstyle. After you play Dota for awhile, you can pick out the heroes that really fit your playstyle and excel at them through ranked matchmaking. It's damn near impossible to be bad at literally every hero. The large hero pool (100+) allows for THOUSANDS of different lineup possibilities, meaning every game has the chance to be completely new and different than anything you've played before.\n\n5) Honestly, Dota 2 is one of the most addicting games I have ever played. No; it is THE most addicting game I have ever played. As a full-time student, I still have managed to rack up 2,500 hours in this game in my free-time. Especially back when I was a new player, I played this game all the time.\n\nHowever. I am actually changing my review of this game from positive to negative. Let me tell you why.\n\n::THE CONS::\n\n1) Here's my biggest flaw with the game. I absolutely hate -- I MEAN HATE -- Valve's regional matchmaking. Before finding a match, the player is supposed to change server preferences to the closest server(s) to the members of the party, and they are supposed to choose the appropriate language preference. For example, as an American player, it is expected that you choose U.S. West and U.S. East as your servers, with English as your language preference. And, generally, Americans follow this rule. HOWEVER. In almost every game I play now, I get a Peruvian or Brazilian or someone from South East Asia in my games. Hopefully it makes sense to the readers of this review that you should not be finding a match in the United States if you live in Asia. You lag, and become actually useless in the game. The South Americans, though, spam in their native languages and constantly flame. Am I generalizing? Honestly, no. I'm really not. If you are good at Dota 2, you would and should queue for games for which you are prepared to play at your best. Valve has no form of region lock on matchmaking (they really can't, due to international professional teams), and while it's really not Valve's fault, I just wish there was some way to reliably play with four people from your country and/or language. This is seriously Dota 2's biggest flaw, because so much of every game revolves around the synergy and cooperation among teammates. This is literally impossible when someone spends the entire game flaming you in a different language. I'm honestly not trying to be discriminatory in any way; this is just how Dota is in reality and is likely never to change. I have become so fed up with this poor form of matchmaking that I have actually, finally, uninstalled the game.\n\n2) Dota has actually no reliable way to punish feeders. Sure, you and your team can use the report system (you only have a limited number of reports by the way, so after you expend them on flamers or feeders you are out of luck and have to enlist the other team and your teammates to waste their reports on the other feeders and flamers). The feeder may get put in low priority, but it honestly teaches them nothing. We have all been in low prio at one point or another, and we come out unchanged. Valve needs to implement a way to correct this. I'm not alone in my view on this either. Even professional player Secret.Puppey voiced his opinion the other day, which is very similar to mine. Punishments need to become more severe.\n\n3) The Dota 2 community is actually cancerous. If you are not playing in a 5-stack of friends, I can almost promise you that you will very rarely, if ever, get on a team where all 5 teammates are willing to cooperate and play as a coordinated team. Almost every single game, someone on your team will flame someone else for sucking really bad, mostly because they probably did. But people speak so hatefully towards one another that it really feels like an unwelcoming scene. One of the professional Dota casters (joinDota's "Capitalist") tweeted the other day that he loses so much respect for pro players in pubs because they spend so much time flaming and tilting. This is actually about 90% of the Dota community, actually, not just the professionals. Everyone has this weird god complex where they are convinced they are better than everyone on the server, even if they got no kills and fed unimaginably badly.\n\n4) This kind of ties in with the points I have made previously. It is almost impossible to single-handedly win a game if your team is playing very poorly. Thus, the entire game comes down to teamwork; and most Dota players are unreliable teammates who will either feed or flame (90%, roughly, like I said). The 10% of people who don't flame are the people who are actually in professional teams (and while they flame in pubs, they synergize well in their professional settings (unless you are kuro and rtz)).\n\n5) Dota is really bad for your health unless you have a godly amount of self control. If you win a game, you can end happy. But if you lose a game, you keep playing and keep losing and it becomes very depressing and frustrating. The garbage community gets in your head, and it's just bad.\n\nLook, honestly, I fully expect to continue to follow the professional Dota scene. Dota really is one of the best games out there and it's especially fun to watch the pros play. But, if you are looking for a MOBA that you can regularly enjoy, then you are better off playing StarCraft II, which is where I am headed now. Don't get me wrong, though; Dota 2 is still much better than League of Legends and I would never suggest League of Legends to anyone unless they are really, really struggling with Dota 2. I won't be returning to Dota until Valve makes some much needed changes to the game, or at least until I have had a long, much-needed break from the seriously draining community that Dota offers.\n\nTL;DR: It's a good MOBA, better than LoL, but too many community & matchmaking issues to make this worth a positive. Gave me a great 3 years of entertainment though. Play SCII.\n\nRating: 7/10\nGood game, for awhile. But community is horrible.","August 26, 2015","false","238.6"," 594 of 763 people (78%) found this review helpful 56 people found this review funny","78","594","763","56","47"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Verwoester/recommended/570/","Verwoester","Verwoester","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Verwoester/","91 products in account","After wasting my +1500 hours on it, i think i can say something about this game.\n\nFirst of all, this review is not a humorous one. I'm writing it seriously to give information about this game. Because it is so popular and too many people want to learn something about it including who has never played it and starters. I think this review will be informative for these people, gamers who has spent couple of hours like me, knows everything i am going to try to tell.\n\nAfter this short introduction, we can start:\n\n-Russians' problem is not about being Russian. Due to the game's popularity among Russian players, there are too many bad (always swears, doesnt play as its a team game, doesnt speak english in eu servers etc.) Russian players. But there are also too many nice Russian players. Briefly, the problem is not about being Russian, if there are 10 gamers in dota, 4 of them will be bad players, if there are 1000, 400 of them. Thats the point.\n\n-If you want to play this game to get relaxed, dont do it. After few matches you will find yourself more depressed, angry or sick instead of relaxed or enjoyed. The bad players are the reason for it. As an illustriation; you started a game to get enjoyed, looked the picks, someone rushed carry heroes without saying anything and suddenly said "me mid" or "me solo" etc., ok thats right you are still relax, you picked a support for your team, they somehow fed the enemies, ok still you are relaxed, they started to argue with each other, they started to swear and fed the enemy team on purpose just because of their arguement, ok you are still trying to convince them to stop it but you feel angry, and then you will lose the game. This type of games are not so rare in dota. 3 over 10 games are being played according to this nutshell. Therefore, it is highly possible that you will find yourself in a very bad mood instead of enjoyed after playing dota.\n\n-Then, why people still playing it too much? Why there is not just bad players in the community now? Because it is addictive. You can not get rid of it. If someone trolls your game, you want to play again and wish to play with better players, if you win the game, you want to win again and increase your mmr, if you lose the game you want to play again to get your mmr back. Shortly, you will want to play again after every game. However, if you are sure that you can stop playing whenever you want, this reason is pointless for you.\n\n-Meaningless mmr system. When i first heard about mmr system i was quite excited. Because it ideally provides an environment that includes less trolls and bad players. However, the system is completely meaningless. Player profile and skills are same at 1k,2k and 3k mmr. Once you get your mmr, it is very hard to increase it too much since every win increase it 25, every lose decrease it 25 and as i said before, player profile is same at 1k 2k and 3k, when you have a bad player in your team it is nearly impossible to win that game etc. It is completely up to your team. So, how people get too high mmr's? They have this mmr at the begining. And how they did it? There is no clear information about it. Valve does not announce how it is being calculated. For example, i played 10 first ranked games with 8 wins, i played support and carries, buy wards and couriers when i was support, i carried the game almost on my own when i was carry, but my mmr was 2200 when some people get 4k starting mmr. This system also a fact about this game's addiction but doesn't help kind players about creating a better environment.\n\n-All in all, i dont recommend this game just because of its community. The game is a master piece, master of MOBAs, it is a great thing that only you can spend your money on cosmetic items in the game, it has great graphics etc. However, it has a really bad community and you will find yourself as one of those bad players when you play more and more and it becomes impossible to get rid of it. On the other hand, if you have a great mental power and patience, play it, i completely recommend it. This review was written for normal patience leveled people. I dont say "Dont waste your time, go and do some social activities", if u want to play video games, dont play it go and play more enjoying games.\n\n-Lastly, i have an advice for valve, it would be better if there will be an administrator system in dota. People who works professionally and for money for this administrator job would examine players' matches who get reports too much and if they see that they are bad players (as defined at the beginning) they should be banned from game for few days or their mmrs should be decreased. Now, it is done completely automatic and so after some low priority matches bad players can continue trolling.\n\nI hope it would be helpful for people who hasnt spent too much time on dota and it would be read by people except from my friends :D\n\n************************Some Suggestions************************\n\nI wrote this review when this game made me feel so bad and desperate. I lost my will to play dota. However then, thanks to some sensitive comments, I started to play dota only with my friends. Now I have some suggestions for people who have similar feelings about dota as I mentioned in my review months ago.\n\n-As some people say in comments of this review, play this game with your friends. After writing this review I have rarely played solo games and it feels better.\n\n-Participate in some tournaments. After lots of bad pub match experiences, that tournament atmosphere offers a great dota experience. You can participate in ESL's or other platforms' open tournaments for free.\n\n-Finally,never give up! You can encounter very kind players as well. After a bad pub game performance, your teammates maybe say "uninstall dota" etc. but after then you can participate in tournaments with your friends. Just do not give any importance what they say. You can see similar things in this review's comments section. There are very kind, sensitive and suggestive comments which try to help me and lots of depressing, offensive comments. Same is true for the player profile in dota, just dont give any importance what the haters say!\n\n***Final Note***\nFor the guys who say "why don't u recommend the game while playing it too much", please read the review again, this review is a complete answer to your question.\n\nGOOD LUCK & HAVE FUN :D\n\nUNFORTUNATELY, IO LOST THE ARCANA SHOWDOWN :(\n\n\n\nEdited: Game hours are updated and some grammar mistakes are corrected. "Some Suggestions" section added. Thank you all for suggestions, comments and rate ups. Final Note section added.","January 11, 2015","false","200.8"," 768 of 1,042 people (74%) found this review helpful 167 people found this review funny","74","768","1","167","53"

You will be a drain on every match causing the economy of your team to drop with your silly actions. Those who are "long-time natives" will support your with their skilled labor. You will be given gold to buy things that you don't deserve.\n\nAfter several hundred hours of work, for which you see little to no compensation, you will finally do something right. People will look at you in shock. How did this second rate citizen do so well? Was it blind luck? A miracle?\nThe immigrants who have no desire to assimilate will continue to  laugh at you (jajajajajaja) and shame you, yelling at you in Spanish and Portuguese. But if you keep at it, if you do nothing but play, you will have more of these moments where the real citizens start to treat you as one of their own.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zarilenth/recommended/570/","zarilenth","Zarilenth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zarilenth/","592 products in account","Dota 2 is quickly becoming the most played game on Steam, and for good reason. The blend of well-balanced multiplayer, infinite replayability, gorgeous aesthetics, and the time and care Valve has put in to support the community is a recipe for perfection. I simply cannot reccomend Dota 2 enough.\n\nThe game boasts a roster of over a hundred heroes, and each one feels unique and well-designed. In any given match, you take control of a singular hero, and victory or defeat hinges not only on how well you play that hero, but how also on how well you synergize with your five person team.\n\nUnfortunately, the barrier of entry is high. Quite a lot of research, preparation, and knowledge is required to be sucessful, and it can be frustrating losing repeatedly. However, tutorials are available to guide new players, and the time spent learning only adds to the satisfaction of landing a five-man Black Hole or pulling off that perfect Blink-Poof combo.\n\nSpectacularly enough, the battlefield is not the only area where the game shines. Dota TV is an in-game spectator mode that allows the option to watch professional teams play in tournaments, including the multi-million dollar International that Valve hosts on a yearly basis.\n\nAnd all of this for free. There are cosmetic items that can be used to customize your favorite hero, however nothing availble changes gameplay in any way.

LoL has childish names like Blue Team, Red Team, Minions, Turrets and Inhibitors. Not to mention all the champion names are like that too. Its targeted at 4-9 year olds that recently quit runescape and want a DirectX9 game because their computer is too wooden. These days, easy games attracts NOOBS. Many LoL players used to play Dota but they got wrecked too hard, so they just play LoL, therefore the all the worlds worst gamers are addicted to this no brainer game. Same reason goes why Dota TI players OWN in ranked LoL, but LoL Worlds players cannot even survive in unranked Dota. The gap for the skill requirements for these 2 games is simply uncomparable.\n\nSimply amazing how Riot earns millions of $$$$$$$ yet still can't keep their servers functioning. The time it takes to download and install Dota2 is about the same as the time to update LoL. Its true that its a selfish company created for REVENUE ONLY. WTF is $10 for a NAME CHANGE? WTF is $20 for a server transfer?

In Dota 2 is a pure free-to-play game, which means that you don't have to unlock heroes, maps or other stuff. The only way to be good at Dota 2 is to know the game. You need to know every single item and hero to become a really good player. And that's the reason i like this game so much. However, this can be a problem for new players. You don't know anything about the game when you spawn in your base with 4 teammates.\nSo, what is this game all about? Well, you play as one of the 105 available heroes and you have to destroy the enemy base. Sounds easy right? Well, to do that you have to fight your way through towers, creeps and of course the other team.\nAt the start of the game you just stay in your 'lane' and farm and harass enemies by attacking or even ganking them. After this 'laning stage' is completed, your team and the enemy team will face eachother in so called 'teamfights'. After a while, one team will have a large gold and experience advantage, and they will push to the other teams base. And then of course destroy it.\n\nVerdict\n---------\nI really enjoyed and still enjoy this game. Dota 2 isn't a pay-to-win game, which makes this game much more enjoyable. Dota 2 also has the best eSports support, you can easily watch a match and select one of the several Broadcasters to make watching eSport matches more enjoyable. The only downside of Dota 2 is the fact that you'll need a lot of knowledge to be good at this game.\n\nIf you manage to survive all the mean teammates and learn everything about the game, you'll easily spend 200 hours on Dota 2. If not, you'll quit within 20 hours.\n\nScore: 91/100","November 25, 2013","true","550.3"," 1,094 of 1,532 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","094","1","0","10"

The great thing about DotA, is EVERY hero is unlocked from the start.  LoL has a limited selection of free champions every week, which is fine, but your options are limited during drafting.  I found myself buying champs that were popular in the current meta just to compete.\n\nI haven't played LoL in months since getting into DotA, how can I?  This game is so much more complex (which is daunting at first), but the more you learn and play the better it gets.

I sometimes end up frustrated, tired and in a bad mood when i can't win a single game in 6 hours of straight gameplay just because of bad players who get in your games to ruin them. Theyre're not just noobs, they just love trolling and ****ing up others people fun.\n\nIf you're noob and wish to play Dota, make sure you have patience and time. Becoming good in this game is really hard, takes years to master and you'll never get to call yourself a pro.\n\nIf you decided to start Dota, DO NOT play online. Practice with bots first, read guides, read items and abilities descriptions first, you got to study before playing in a real game with humans. It can be very frustrating for old players to deal with people that simple come to ''try out'' a new game into their matches and ruin them. Please. Someday you will realize what i mean with this.\n\nI play DotA since 2007 (Dota 1) and I have hit my keyboard, laughed, yell'd to my girlfriend for no reason and even let my bad mood affect my scores in school because instead of studying math, I decided to stay late playing and made me lose time I could spend with friends. Lost many good stuff I could have done out-game because I said ''One more match...'' which became 10 more matches... and ended up totally frustrated without winning one of them, unable to sleep well those nights. Due to this, to the careless community and the fact that your mood can be affected by DotA and how it makes you feel, i can't recommend this game.\n\nDota is not just another game to your library.

The program lets me assume the role of another creature, helping me experience our oneness with the universe.\n\nI like to assume the position of the dinosaur-riding, lightning-wielding, half-lizard half-man. I like to join servers with up to nine other disciples, be “Disruptor” (as he is called), and go to the jungle, closing my eyes; there I concentrate on my breathing.\n\nThe other disciples (woefully) always curse at me. I usually have to mute them. I do so to concentrate on being one with the virtual nature. (I can’t afford to go to national parks, so this is the best thing). Sometimes I see lots of colorful exclamations points and these “PING PING PING PING PING” sounds occur around my character. They are beautiful.\n\nOne time someone said, “THE ♥♥♥♥?! LEVEL 1 DISRUPTOR, BUY COURIER YOU ♥♥♥♥ING ♥♥♥♥♥♥!” And the truth is there are many players like him. They aren’t at peace with themselves. Perhaps if he came into the forest and hummed koans with me, and he had done so as the giant, walking tree, then he would see his greater consciousness. All the negative energy would leave his body, and we’d share a moment of experiencing our Buddha nature.\n\nIn my experience, sessions last about 10-20 minutes. And initially it did not take long to find a server; apparently I’ve been moved to “low-priority matchmaking.” But that’s okay. I just assume the lotus position in my chair and wait patiently. The only downside to this is that sometimes I forget to click the "accept" button.","May 31, 2015","true","720.3"," 107 of 126 people (85%) found this review helpful 152 people found this review funny","85","107","126","152","1"

Public games are a pure pain 90% of time because of this. I spent most of my 1000+ hours with my friends and even if there was 3 of us, there was still 2 other people on our team who were capable more than enough to ruin the game completely. I am not talking about skill level or gameplay habits but about conduct and morales.\nYour matches will be repeatedly ruined by idiotic people who can't behave themselves, refuse to cooperate and are not manly enough to admit defeat. No matter how good DOTA is at its core, the time I spent playing such matches was vastly irritating and I am never getting that time back.\n\nHere's a list of some pretty standard stuff that you'll be dealing with EVERY. GOD*AMN. MATCH:\n\n-very rarely anyone ever commends you for the good plays you manage (that is, if they even notice).\n\n-if you screw something up, misclick or miss a spell, it's gonna be pointed out immidiatelly by your     team and they will talk sh*t to you and shove it into your face for the rest of the match.\n\n-should you ever raise constructive criticism against someone, no matter how kind words you use, that person will most likely not only refuse to learn from it, they will also start to actively look for any tiniest flaws on your side trying to look more pro than you.\n\n-there is no such thing as asking for something. People just expect you to do something and then   they talk sh*t to you that you didn't do it.\n\n-people will constantly blame you for their own mistakes. It will mess with your head even though it's obvious the fault is on their side.\n\n-people will start talking sh*t to you out of the blue and refuse to tell you the reason why they're doing it. If they're total fuc*ing idiots, they will just tell you to watch replay.\n\n-you will be constantly reminded to uninstall dota.\n\n-a teammate will seem completely oblivous to your attempts to communicate with them but will gladly say "noob" when you comment on the fact that they don't cooperate.\n\n-if you're just having a bad day and your performance is outright bad, your whole team will start a f*cking crusade against you. They will start talking the enemy team into reporting you and they will very likely sabotage your gameplay in various ways.\n\n-at a certain point when victory seems too far, some of these ret*rds just have a breakdown and will remain afk and just move occassionally to not be auto-kicked by the game, effectively ruining the match and wasting time of anyone on their team who actually wants to play.\n\n-if there is no one specific to blame for losing, they will just throw it on the person with the lowest K/D. Preferably a healer support hero who rarely gets any kills at all.\n\nThis list is just a tip of the iceberg. I am constantly losing faith in humanity because of people in this game. If you ever meet someone who doesn't qualify for this list, send them a big hug from me, because it's those people who keep me playing somehow. Them and the fact that I am too deep into the game to stop playing. It really is pretty good otherwise.\nWith this in mind, I cannot possibly encourage you to have your precious time ruined by terrible cowardly people who don't understand that griefing and destructive criticisim aren't helping anything and can only make matters worse.","November 7, 2014","false","202.7"," 435 of 599 people (73%) found this review helpful 216 people found this review funny","73","435","599","216","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegallows/recommended/570/","thegallows","Gallows","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thegallows/","1289 products in account","Dota 2 ranks among few titles that can be classified as truly free-to-play.  While many other titles label themselves with this distinction, there are often convenience purchases or some form of power available for real money transactions.  While Dota 2 has an extensive cash shop, all offerings are completely cosmetic.  HUD options, voice packs and character costumes form the basis of a store lacking even an iota of power or convenience for purchase.  All gameplay elements are absolutely free and do not require collection or usage of any kind of in-game currency.\n\nOnce a player has determined that they’re ready to commit to a steep learning curve and potential negative interactions with teammates (Again, learn with friends to reduce this aspect), Dota 2 is incredibly enjoyable and possibly one of the best multiplayer games ever made.  Every match is different, and watching perfect team fight execution is gaming art.  Players have access to a huge range of hero styles and the interactions between teammates and foes are incredibly diverse.  It’s twenty to forty-five minutes of gladiatorial bliss, the end result carefully orchestrated from the first enemy tap to the final crushing blow.\n\nDota 2 can be experienced and enjoyed at multiple levels of engagement, and it’s a title that rewards users for a deep dive.  Heavy investment, heavy reward.  The barrier to entry isn’t quite as bad as it was years ago, but it would be disingenuous to say that the game doesn’t have a colossal learning curve.  As a free-to-play title readily available on Steam, it offers players a frictionless doorway – but the challenge may be keeping new players interested and willing to commit to the epic journey that is learning, playing, and enjoying Dota 2.\n\nThe game is in a strong place right now. It’s rewarding and sociable like few other games, and despite its vast popularity it still feels like a secret waiting to be discovered. The next few months will be crucial: it’s currently the best expression of Valve’s progressive attitude towards players, and if it can continue on that track it describes a future for online gaming that is far more hopeful than the one we’re used to.\n\nJust remember to spend your starting cash, and make sure someone buys the courier. Oh, and when Riki starts showing up in your games, just get some Sentry Wards down and don't run away. Also, you always want a Bottle when in mid-lane, and runes spawn at 0:00 and again every two minutes. Practice last-hitting before you go online. And if you're jungling, memorise where the low-level Creeps are.\n\nActually, you know what? Forget all that. Just have fun.\n\n4 out of 5","January 19, 2014","true","633.7"," 111 of 135 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","111","135","0","8"

Your home is abuzz with laughter, and the smell of fresh baked goods drifts up from downstairs. You race to the tree, and begin to open a beautiful present, adorned with festive colors and a wrapping scheme that is both dauntingly complex yet also simple in its execution. You turn to your mother, father, and two siblings and smile; for you know that your adventure into opening your gift is about to begin. You go to open your unwrapped box, and BWONG.. A horn bellows, deafening you. Out of the box pops a small, dwarf-like figure, wielding a multicultural bat festooned with Ecuadorian and Peruvian patterns, and of Russian construction. "THANKS FOR STANDING STILL, GANKER," he shrieks, as he wallops young brother Timmy in the teeth. Your mother tuts and scolds him, for being out of position. The dwarf darts under the tree, looking for a hole in the wall to continue his pursuit of rat-DOTA. "Gank him, ♥♥♥♥ blyat!" your father roars, as he sits on the couch lazily and watches. You crawl, desperate for your gift of victory over the rat, under the tree, and he continues to elude you. Suddenly, with a flourish, he produces a lighter, and proceeds to methodically burn down your house while muttering "GG 2 EZ", and your family sits in the living room muttering "garbage team" and "reported". Your family home burns down around them, and only you escape the engulfing flames, accompanied by the chortles of the dwarf. Downtrodden but not easily bested, you begin your walk down the street to your friend's house, in the hopes that by having Christmas at their house, you might be able to somehow catch the multicultural dwarf on the second try.\n\n10/10 Best fun and Peruvian simulator.","June 23, 2014","true","861.4"," 65 of 68 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","65","68","0","1"

I've been playing Dota 2 for around 10 years since it was DotA, the Warcraft III custom map and I'll tell you right now there's still a lot of room for personal improvement. This game boils down to far more than individual skill, tactics, and teamwork/cooperation. The author of "Three Lane Highway" (see pcgamer.com) has called Dota an "isometric wizard-em up" game, and I think it's fitting. There are so many aspects to this game, so many factors that control the outcome that if you try and sit down and list them all it'll take you a couple hours. And you'll still miss some. I have played pretty much every single "Multi-player Online Battle Arena" on the market, and no matter how interesting they are or what different elements they try to bring to the gameplay, I always end up coming back to Dota.\n\nIf you want to seriously challenge yourself, and you have the will and motivation to work towards a lofty goal that many are unable to reach, this is the game for you.","June 26, 2014","true","833.7"," 71 of 78 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","71","78","0","4"

My name is [IG] D[andi] SingSing aka Wild♥♥♥♥♥Digger1998UA and i will throw some of my wild gameplay suggestions in a game that is totally not corrupted by trends, pro leagues where people play like lobsters on acid (denying your own aegis because you click like a frenzied ape when nothing around is happening) and totally not toxic community where every Ivan, George and PingPongClingClong is a distinguished pro gamer with 200 years of  training at Icefrog's monastery of enlightement somewhere inbetween Tibet's asscheeks.\n\nOkay, let's go: This riding on cat Mirana chick with face that looks like she just seen a dolphin putting on a condom. Her ultimate allows teammates to get invisibility for given time. Which can, for instance, save your carry+ support who is getting dived by frenzied Bristleback and enemy mid hero with 2 runes up his butt. So just press r - and since they didnt have any dusts - your carry is safe. Haha, no! We can't have any of that! I need more damage on my arrow that i will miss anyway. Plus if my allies are dying, i can just blame them instead of doing anything. If they are russians - just double your blame output.\n\nOkay, so we have that hero, Spector, but it doesnt look like this gay guy from Bioware game. So she has ability to move through obstacles and units, has free tons of pure damage (can't be reduced by armor) on every illusion, and map presense with her ultimate that allows her to fight at any given time without leaving her farming spots until necessary, and with high enough agility her illusions can just inflict enough damage so your team can fight freely while you patiently taking your farm. SO WHAT DO WE DO? OF COURSE WE AINT GONNA DO ANY OF THAT: we will get her phase boots because spectral dagger is clearly not enough, we will never ever get free damage on carry, and we get a bloody skill that blocks and returns damage instead (when enemy team has like. ugh, same damage output as yours?and you have no hp yet anyway?). Get vanguard that just doesn't work because of dota 2's RNG programming and then will farm radiance till 50' timemark because expensive aura with item's green damage that doesnt work on illusions (even though aura does work and can do a lot of good things, like blocking enemy's blink dagger that will be blocked by your ult in a second anyway) is clearly better than stat-gain or mana-burn.\n\nOkay, so we have that orange bird guy, that can hold solo lane against 2 or 3 people with minimum deaths (except some specific combos that just screw up his escape) and set of abilities that allows to eviscerate enemy team if your allies have at least ANYTHING to hold them in place. What are we gonna do with this hero, you may ask. Of course we will put him on a support role and make him buy mekansm, so he would never have any mana for his high damage dots that also have ridicilous slow debuff and ult that is easily countered only like by ten heroes out of 150. We have Mirana without ultimate to go get all this exp, remember?\n\nAlright, these situations are obviously too situative, so we will talk about global scale meta:\nLet's get to most obvious question: what hero should we pick? The answer is - PUDGE.\nYou need mid - you pick PUDGE. You need support - you pick PUDGE. You need offlane, jungler, roamer, carry, social worker, girlfriend, president of the united states of 'Murrica? - Just pick Pudge. Why? Because someone did that on twitch.tv, you silly noob cheekyscrublord.\nYou, of course, have same skill as pro players so you can just mimic them and game will be magically won! You don't need to think about anything, just buy recommended items and blame your teammates if something is wrong. You got a motherflipping DRAGONCLAW HOOK afterall. If you bought an item that is worth of 3 years of your school lunchboxes - nobody will have enough guts to argue with your divine skill in pressing q button at cursor location to lasthit a creep (mute everyone at the start of the game just in case tho).\n\nNext important issue is map presense, lane control, creep control, ability to analyze situation, counter-warding and all that important elements of this pseudo-strategical map game. For all of that just remember these two lines:\n"BUY WARDS"\n"WHERE THE GANG" (it is important that you will never type "gank" properly).\n\nThis is basically all you need to know about this game. Remember: its not important to win! It's the whole competetive spirit and sportsmanship that matters! Everyone has around 50% winrate anyway because of matchmaking, and ELO system in rankeds is based on wizard-science and tarot-fortunetelling (it's supposed to work only in chess anyway). Yeah, developers may tell you their rating system is not based on elo, but can Volvo really pull off their own mathematic rating model for the game that after all these years still lags when someone is picking a hero, armor rating still doesnt work properly, and hero with 320 movespeed can chase down and kill hero with 350 because of model animation? Oooh i think not.\n\nAnyway i give this game 100 dirty apes out of 100 and encourage you to start playing as fast as possible, to join in most viral addiction the world ever saw since taking heroin rectally, poping polyethylene packages or throwing water filled condoms out of the window became a thing.","October 25, 2014","true","689.4"," 193 of 258 people (75%) found this review helpful 20 people found this review funny","75","193","258","20","15"

I'll keep it brief.\n\nDota 2 is probably the most frustrating game ever created. Your team will let you down constantly, the enemy team will consistently pick the heroes you hate playing against the most, you will never get the hat drops you want, and your own mind and body will frequently betray you and make you contend with the fact that you are not nearly as good as you think you are (or, more likely, force you to live in a fantasy dream world where you are as good as you think you are and just blame your teammates some more). It'll turn you into a monster and destroy your life. It'll murder your loved ones and feed them to you.\n\nBut you'll play it anyway. You'll ragequit and uninstall and stare at your library of games as the creeping realization sweeps over you that you not playing Dota 2 will not effect the universe in even the smallest way, will have no conceivable effect on anything. You will be filled with a sudden dread that nothing you do matters and life has no meaning. Basically the same feeling you get when you play Dota 2. And Dota 2 will be your only distraction from this dessicated husk of a life. So the next day you'll find yourself drawn back into it like a moth to a flame, staving off the moment when you'll have to face your demons for as long as you can. You will probably die alone some day and nobody will remember how high your MMR was or your sunstrike accuracy.\n\nSo what are you waiting for, you worthless peons?! Get out there and dance! DANCE FOR THE PUPPETMASTER GABE! GO EARN YOUR HATS, YOU CRAVEN MONGRELS!\n\n0/10 would not recommend to anyone but can't stop playing and won't be able to stop you either.","December 29, 2013","true","789.4"," 77 of 91 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","77","91","0","5"

Because if you managed it, it'd make you feel better. What other games does your mood revolve around whether you play well, and how many other games can you name where you'd take that 'feeling good' to the point of willingly sacrificing an entire day to it?\n\nUnless you've got a team of people to play with, and you don't care how much you suck, or you're actually a pro-gamer with an active team looking for a transition, don't waste your time.

Some queens shoot lasers, some summon huge Golems and some sing so hard your eardrums burst. Dota 2 is definitely one of the best games of this generation, and I'm certain it will remain as popular and as influnencal for many years to come.\n\nGraphics: 8.5/10\nVery pretty, the art direction in DotA 2 is one of the best. The source engine ensures you can run it on anything more powerful than a toaster, and have it look great too. Cosmetics look great, and fit perfectly, with some exceptions,(I'm looking at you Alpine Ursa) but many stay true to the heros artstyle.\n\nSound: 9.5/10\nAll heros have a multitude of voice lines,and some even respond to one another (e.g Tidehunters hatred for Kunnka). If you find the default anouncer not too flash, theres a huge variety of optional packs, from the smoth talking Narrator from bastion, to the harsh condescending tone of Pyrion Flax.\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nThe big one. Theres a reason DotA Allstars got so popular, not just from the incredible passsion from the community, or the dedication of IceFrog and co., but from the incredible gameplay that spawned one of gamings most popular genres. From perfectly co-ordinating a fountain hook, to getting stuck on top of a cliff accidentally as Storm Spirit, no other genre rivals DotA 2 outstanding strategic gameplay and near-vertical learning curve. At the time of writing, I have 7,469 hours played and I've only just scratched the surface in the combos, stratagy and 107 availble heros to use, it takes year of hard work, dedication and passion to become truly great at the strategical masterpeice that is Dota 2.\n\n- beardATTACK @ fren","May 21, 2014","true","131.9"," 55 of 61 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","55","61","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Leeluhm/recommended/570/","Leeluhm","리암 | Leeluhm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Leeluhm/","428 products in account","Dota 2 is a very highly skilled game, don't expect to walk in and expect you being very good. You are going to die alot and probably yell at your team mates but that's just the nature of this game. Dota 2 takes place in an arena where you will fight to destory the enemies Anicent if you destory it; you win.\n\nThe Ancient is protected by 11 stuctures called towers that protect it. Each of these towers are found in each of the three lanes bottom, middle and top. You take control of a unit that is a hero, many of them are diverse and have a lot of pros and cons such as Crystal Maiden who is really good at locking down heros early game with her stun but she is also the slowest hero in the game.\n\nYou are accompanied by 4 other players including yourself to fight against another 5 players. You need to push lanes to be able to destory the enemy towers in each lane but the catch is the enemy team is doing the same thing, so you need to not only push to your victory but to stop the enemy team from pushing aswell.\n\nThere is 107 heros in Dota 2 out of the 112 heroes that are in the Warcraft III. They are categorised into 3 groups. Strenght, which are usually the tanky guys. Agility, most carries are found in this category and Intelligence which most of the supports are usually found. All these heroes have different skill levels, such as Invoker who is an intelligence hero with 14 spells. He is able to create spells with 4 of his spells, creating the other 10. He is able to create tornados which disable enemies, meteors which looks epic and burns enemies that stand in front of it. Just an all round crazy hero. Viper is arguably the easiest hero which as 2 passive spells (Passive spells are spells that work all the time, you don't need to activate them) and 2 other spells which are targetable.\n\nYou can customise your Dota experience with annoucer packs which change the voice of the annoucer which include Glados and the narrator from the Stanley Parable. You can change your HUD to different themes.\n\nThe game allows you to buy tickets where you can support tournments, some of these tournments allowing you to directly contribute to the prize pool. Most of the time it is 25%. In 2014, The International is a annual tournment created by Valve for Dota 2. In 2014, the prize pool for this tournment became 10.9M dollars. First place got 5M dollars! If you are into ESports then this game will be up your ally.\nDota 2 is a hard game, but if you look in the right places you are able to learn a lot, if you aren't sure you want to play this game, you can PM me and I can teach you how to play. I honestly don't mind.\n","October 14, 2014","true","392.1"," 75 of 94 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","75","94","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AndreyKva/recommended/570/","AndreyKva","AndreyKva","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AndreyKva/","222 products in account","At first I thought this game was pretty good, but that was until the first time I was called a "feeder".\n\nDota 2 is basically a game based around teamwork, except the players only do three things.\n1. Call each other f*gs and berate one another for slightly unwise decisions.\n2. Do solo farm and try to win the match by themselves (which never works).\n3. Make fun of, and ruin everything for, new players.\n\nIf you want to learn how to play Dota, you either need a really good guide, or a good friend who has quite a few hours into the game. The tutorial just teaches you the basics. No, you can't learn by yourself by playing matchmaking with random people. All you'll learn from the other players is that you suck because you're new and you don't understand the game, and that the best course of action would be to uninstall. There's also the fact that some people create new Steam accounts so they can be matched up against newbies and annihilate everyone.\n\nThe worst thing is that this game stole all my friends. We used to play other games, now they play nothing other than Dota 2. One of them has spent $40 on the game... ON SKINS! COSMETIC ITEMS THAT ADD NOTHING TO THE GAMEPLAY! YOU CAN BUY SOME OF THE BEST GAMES ON STEAM FOR LESS, I REPEAT, LESS THAN $40! AND THEN HE TOLD ME HE ONLY PLAYS DOTA BECAUSE HE CAN'T AFFORD ANY GAMES ON STEAM! WHAT THE HELL?!\n\nSo, there. Terrible community, steals your friends, incredibly addictive for some people.\n\nDon't touch this game. I spent way too much time hating myself while playing this. Never again.\n\nEDIT: 172 people agreed with this review. Wow.\nAlso, I have to say, I think the in-game tutorials are better than the actual game. The actual game has only one map, unlike the tutorials. I know this is pretty standard for MOBA games, but for me, this contributes greatly to ruining fun and variety. It's just all the same tactics over and over on the same map. This doesn't only mean less excitement, but it also means that veterans will know the game just that much better.\n\nOn another note, this game is like the opposite of everything I like about TF2.\n\nUnbalanced classes (According to Google, every Dota hero/champion/class/whatever the hell is overpowered), only A SINGLE MAP, relies too much on teamwork when it's hard to find online (TF2 benefits from teamwork, but it's not required. It's also much easier to actually achieve teamwork, because TF2 doesn't rely NEARLY as much on your early-game. The early-game in Dota literally either makes or breaks the whole game for you, setting the outcome of the match in stone literally during the first ten minutes of the game.), and also, a horrible community. I'm not saying TF2's community is good, but hell, it's miles above Dota.\n\nI don't really know why I'm comparing this game to TF2. Maybe because Valve made both games? Still, just wanted to share some actual criticism about the game itself and not the community.\n\nOne guy in the comments told me "Pfft, just block the trash talkers". That doesn't change anything. They're still horrible at teamwork, which, like I said, is the entire point of the game. And if you block them, you can't coordinate with them. It's not only a bad game for new players because you suck, it's also a bad game for new players because everyone else sucks. Except for Koreans, whenever you see one in a game, bam, his team has won.\n\nOverall, I think Dota has great potential, but it's just too bad that the game will most likely never actually achieve to fulfill it.\n\nEDIT 2: I just came back to this game and tried it out again the hopes that maybe SOMETHING about it has gotten better.\n\nNo.\n\nThere's still absolutely no communication between the players except for casual pings here and there. That's not helpful at all.\n\nThere are tonnes of balancing issues in the game, and the one character that stands out the most is Sniper. He has good abilities and does really high damage at a really fast rate at a really long distance if you play the game right. He can easily annihilate two to three heroes by himself in the late-game. Frankly, he is cheap, and and he was almost practically made to steal kills (something I'll be addressing a bit later). Valve is a company structured in a way that, if you're an employee, you don't really NEED to do these things. You don't NEED to patch bugs. You don't NEED to fix balancing issues. At Valve, the employees' primary concern is getting recognition. If you add something that looks cool, you're gonna get recognition. If you're going to fix something, you're not, because you're not showing off your creativity or imagination. You're doing an important job to ensure that the product works as intended. No-one at Valve cares for that, they need more hats.\n\nLet's go back to the kill stealing. When fighting any enemy or neutral, you get much more experience and gold, as well as the kill credit, if you actually deliver the killing blow. Yep, just the last hit, no questions asked. It doesn't matter if you've reduced someone from full to 1% health and someone from your team pops out of nowhere to take the kill credit and leave you with a measly amount of gold and experience. A lot of players hate these kill thieves, but you know what? That's exactly what this game encourages. To screw other players over. Couldn't, say, the gold and experience be divided between the two players based on the damage they did? Nope. Instead, the players are forced to naturally hate each other. If you are an actually fair player who doesn't want to rely on these cheap tactics, you'll be behind in the game. What is this, Defense of the Capitalists?\n\nI previously mentioned that one friend spent $40 on cosmetics in DOTA 2. I actually played this game with him again, and he has spent about, well... $300 on the game. That's enough to buy 4 copies of GTA V here in Australia. He was also recently hacked and had $200 worth of cosmetics stolen from him. That's what you get when you purchase blatantly overpriced virtual trash that does not affect you in any way.\n\nProbably one of the absolutely worst parts of the game, and also the big reason as to why it steals lives, are the long matches. Matches usually take anywhere between 30 to 50 minutes. The longest I've seen is 70 minutes. You're not going to have time to go to the toilet (I bet Valve is in cahoots with adult diaper manufacturers), you're not going to have time to eat, you're not going to have time to speak to people while playing the game or do little chores around the house that your parents need you to do because they're incredibly impatient, and if you're going to get addicted to the game, like most of its players, you're not going to have time to have a life. See: my Russian cousin.\n\nThe biggest thing I hate (for real) is that when your early-game sucks, you're going to be stuck in a losing match where you know you've lost and all your team is doing is delaying the inevitable. Losing feels horrible, and if you quit at this point,THE CONSEQUENCES WILL NEVER BE THE SAME!!! LITERALLY!!! The more you abandon games (doesn't matter if the game crashes on you or if you have a slow internet connection and the entire thing stopped working or if you have a really slow connection and it messes up and boots you out of the game or if you have a slow computer, like my $300 friend, and your entire computer crashes and you can't get back in the game), the more you will be punished. So, on your first few abandons, you will get a few low priority matchmaking games (low priority games are pretty much like the normal priority games ON STEROIDS! So, more insults, less teamwork, more nasty guys, more kill steals). Then, as you keep abandoning games, the punishment gets more severe each time. The amount of low prio games you get for abandoning never goes down.\n\nThis is the final edit. I have pretty much ran out of charac","October 24, 2014","false","88.6"," 266 of 391 people (68%) found this review helpful 22 people found this review funny","68","266","391","22","20"

Within a few days, however, you'll feel an urge to play it. You're going to watch videos of pro people teaching you how to play, and you're going to think that now you're really good.\nYou're wrong.\nOver time, however, things will get better, and you'll actually start winning. Then, you start losing again, but this time it's not your fault; it's your teams fault. Always remember that NOTHING is EVER your fault. Your dumbass anti-mage was complaining that you were stealing his farm, but it's your farm dammit! Then pudge is getting butthurt about losing lane because he never had a flying courier, when the real reason he lost is because he didn't give you unit control when you are clearly a better pudge! Meanwhile the enemy team is getting fed because your teamates never backed you up when you blitzkrieged in 1v5, and they even have the nerve to question your methods! Then you notice that your dumbass anti-mage is in the jungle farming because "he couldn't farm in lane." You know, however, that he is just a noob.\nEventually the enemy is pushing your tier 3s, and the game is obviously over. This is the time when you give up and sit in base. Ignore the fact that your team has won the last two teamfights and you are starting to catch up, it's better if you just quit now. While you're waiting in base, make sure that the enemy team knows that you are not at fault in your loss. Make sure you type in all-chat "team noob" followed up by "report anti-mage." If they ask why you want them to report him, ignore them, if your team has the bodacity to try and defend themseves, repeatedly say phrases such as "lol ur so bad" and "ur just mad cuz you cant play."

Plus, it unifies gamers and conservatives by creating one common hatred: Russians.\n\nAll in all, this game is 90% getting ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and 10% feeling like you're on top of the world, but that 10% makes you feel sooooo good that it keeps pulling you back.","May 29, 2014","true","333.6"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","41","43","0","4"

You're both in a small shower tub trying desperately to shove each other over while at the same time trying not to accidentally touch peens and catch the gay.\n\nWhen you slip over and land painfully on your ♥♥♥ the other guy, completely by accident, gets his soap-stained foot into your mouth just as you both realize somebody downstairs is hogging all the hot water. Then one of the guys from downstairs who should be helping you get back up on your feet instead comes into the room and yells at you for stealing all the hot water even though it's the other way around.\n\nYou're the noob who can't get better at naked shower fights no matter how hard you try, the other guy in the tub is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ from the enemy team who mains bounty hunter, anti-mage, puck, ursa, or some other broken class, and the people downstairs who made you run out of hot water are your teammates getting last hits on what would be your kills and turning them into assists on your end. The guy who comes in from downstairs to yell at you is the teammate who, even though you're farming plenty of creeps and earning plenty of gold and experience from them, insists you're killing them "the wrong way" and are therefore an idiot noob.\n\nThe naked shower fight is also a one-way road: once you jump in, there is virtually no returning. You become enslaved and before long all you'll ever want to do for the rest of your life is play dota. You won't even want to talk to or interact with anyone from the outside world unless they are similarly enslaved, by dota (or LoL). The video game world then slowly proceeds to divide and coalesce into two and only two distinct spheres of existence and reality: people who play mobas, and people who don't. Neither side ever so much as glimpses at the other for the remainder of each of its constituents' entire lives because its masochistic addiction level is insane enough to leave Starcraft and WoW in the dust.\n\nIf you complain about how slippery the surface of the showertub is, people will just yell at you because you're terrible at the game and don't consult the online guidebook and metagame like they do for every minute, individual step taken throughout the game. If you want to get "good", you are unequivocally required to follow the instruction book down to the exact letter even if it hardly makes a difference in-game, if at all. If you do otherwise, you will get yelled at. Every single time without exception. To not get yelled at, you have to assimilate into the formless mass. This is all a part of the self-enslavement process: you won't come back, ever. And within a month you'll find yourself just parrotting the same ♥♥♥♥ people were yelling at you for earlier, because you'll be one of them by that point.\n\nAnd you literally will not return. You'll be doing this for the entire rest of your life and will be speaking it like a language.","April 6, 2014","false","22.2"," 95 of 128 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","95","128","5","23"

The majority of the community is quite unpleasant at times and isn't very beginner-friendly which can be really off-putting. If you ignore these people (a.k.a. muting) and just keep doing your thing, you will find yourself genuinely having fun after ~50 hours. 50 hours sounds kinda extreme but it really isn't. This is the kind of game you can spend thousands of hours on and you still won't be able to fully master it.\n\nIf you're ready to go through all this hardship and frustration, go for it, I highly recommend DotA 2.\nIf you're looking for a casual multiplayer game that you can get into quickly, stay away from this.","May 20, 2014","true","248.7"," 51 of 59 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","51","59","0","2"

A game with potential that teases you and lures you in only for you to experience a miserable 60 minute match of abusive players or people who don't communicate or work together in a game that depends entirely on team work. If it's all too stressful, you also cannot leave the match due to the punishment system which tends to punish more benign players than abusive. Despite the game being marketed as competitive and stressing against abandoning matches, the devs don't seem to care that majority of the players don't know what they are doing & matchmaking doesn't take this into consideration, so often times one team gets all the good players. So you'll either be experiencing a miserable match you can never win, or a match you win so easily and unfairly that it doesn't feel like a win.\nBasically playing DOTA 2 is like gambling or playing the lottery. Sometimes personally knowing how to play is good enough, but the majority of the time it is just the luck of the draw. There are plenty of other games you can play if you like that though, that don't require you to sit in a 60 minute match or recieve punishment if you don't.","May 6","false","401.4"," 157 of 226 people (69%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","69","157","226","28","0"

What consumers thought would be another fun and enjoyable experience for the family turned out to be much more. This game is called "Dota 2" which is an acronym for "Delicious Orange Teamwork Association 2", the sequel to the original DOTA.\nDOTA 2 revolves around 2 teams of 5 players each (the perfect number for a happy family and maybe even a friend to all sit down on the couch and play together as a team) who are both trying to sell as many oranges as possible while sabotaging the enemy team's orange sales!\nGameplay is very casual and easy to pick up. You don't even have to play the tutorial if you don't want to! Just jump in the game, let everyone know you're new and start selling oranges!\nSpeaking of new players, those who are new to the DOTA universe might be a little discouraged by all the terms that more experienced players use, so I'll explain a few of them here.\n-"Feeding" is when your team is selling oranges at a very fast rate. This is very good, so make sure you feed as much as possible!\n-"♥♥♥♥" is a term you may see thrown around a lot by players of this game. DOTA is a very popular game in Russia, because it is developed by a mysterious individual named "Ice Man" who is from Russia! "♥♥♥♥" is a friendly term that roughly translates to "Keep up the good work!"\n-"Report" When someone says "Reported." or "Im going 2 report u!" that means that they are filling out a sales report on how well you've sold oranges! This is a fun way to keep track of how good you are at the game, and it's considered friendly to try to report the best players you see in a game, even if they're on the enemy team!\nDOTA 2 has over fifty dozen players on at a time, so you better get playing now and become a veteran because before you know it, everyone and their grandmas will be playing the new nation-sweeping casual game DOTA 2!","February 16, 2014","true","549.8"," 60 of 74 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","60","74","0","4"

PLAYED DOTA 2 BEFORE-\n\n-this game has good sides too, but i'm just focusing on the bad side of it-\n\ni used to love Dota 2, and both Dota 1, as you can see in my play time which is about 1900 hrs,\nso why would i not recommend this title?\nhere is why:\n___________\n\n-Community-\n___________\n*this game has a big lack of good community, you set your language preference in English, u find a game in EU then all you see is some people saying some weird alien things...\n*there are actually no consequences due to getting reported or reporting someone the worst case scenario is that person must play 6 games or more with his own type of people.\n___________\n\n-Ranking systems-\n___________\n*i know some people and that has happened to me too, some one can win games in a mmr of like +3800 but that person keeps losing in the mmr of less than 3000, so its like even if you can play like a pro, if you have bad teammates and even n00b enemies, you cant play the game after all and you are always depress cause you cant reach what you actually are better than it,\n___________\n\n-Updates-\n___________\n*the updates this game does, are not actually balancing things, there is always some heroes unbalanced and OP in the patches, i remember it even from dota 1 of Huskar and Slark beeing OP, later came to Troll , Necrophos, gyro, Omni,OD, and now that im writing this Axe as the most OP hero, the game just insists to have OP heroes in it, so here is the result :\nsome hero like Omni or necro has about 60% winrate, and some hero like vissage and Oracle has around 30-40% winrate that's about twice of it!\nno matter how good you are with a weak hero, u mostly lose with it, unless you are some kinda god with that hero,\n___________\n\n-Stress and focus-\n___________\n*when you are playing Dota 2 you must pay your whole attention to it, even if some one calls you or say something to you while you are in game you don't even notice or understand what they say!\nfailure causes a LOT of stress in this game, even if you win but have a rough game, its like you have done something really tense and that suffers you,\n*because of this thing mentioned, when you lose, you want to play more dota 2 until you win and get satisfied but because you are tense and stressful you can't concentrate and you keep on losing and that cause a major depression on you,\n*even if you say you don't care about stresses and you play for fun, yet you can not deny the effects of it on yourself.\n*Dota 2 can affect your whole life, all you can think about all day is dota 2, when u study, when with family, when at job, anytime and anywhere, focusing or concentrating on a subject would be really hard for you.\n___________\n\n-Friendships-\n___________\n*this game make friends for you, and take them from you too.\ni have been playing this game with my brother from the beginning and there were a lot of times we yelled and insulted each other, i don't think a game worth of becoming a secluded and isolated person from family and friends,\n*there were several of times that Dota 2 gave me friends, and then it took them away from me.\n*if you have a friend which is not good as you, you might feel to get away from them, this goes for you too, so this will make you a horrible materialist person, who only prefer to be friend with "The cool guy"\n___________\n\n-the Results-\n___________\n*from playing other games, you learn things, you feel things you get emotional and its like you watched a movie directed by yourself, but games like Dota 2, have no purpose in it, you are just playing it for the game play\nit has nothing to present to you after all, you get nothing by playing this game, but you get a lot of moments playing other good games,\n*you learn to abuse,blame and insult everyone easily and you forget that you are just a human as everyone are.\n*Racism: i don't think i have to explain much about this..."stupid Russian", "damned Pinnoy","noob turk" ................( no offence btw i'm actually against this. read bellow )\nwell, the fact is my friend, there are actually a lot of great and good Gamers and persons in those countries tbh, we always pretend we are against racists and yet we spread the racism,\n*this game just take your time away,you run away from your problems to this game instead of facing with them, its like an addiction, its actually totally an addiction to video games, once you got in, its hard to leave.\nyou always think about it, you always need to play this game, well my friend, this is an addiction!!\n___________\ni hope my review was useful\n\nEdit: 5/22/2016 added some more things.\nEdit: 5/25/2016 added columns for easier reading.\nEdit: 5/28/2016 the discussions between me and Pure in the comments its somehow a review too read them also. :D","May 16","false","887.6"," 357 of 544 people (66%) found this review helpful 78 people found this review funny","66","357","544","78","53"

In fact, thinking of dota as a game at all is a mistake; games are designed to be enjoyable and fun. Enjoying yourself and having fun is the the lowest priority for those who play dota, (especially for those in low priority.) they prefer instead to stubbornly not enjoy themselves while simultaneously making sure nobody else is having any fun either.\n\nEvery facet of the game has been finely tuned to reflect the players personality to the point that each decision they make in game is synonymous with how russian they are they conduct themselves in their day to day lives, what kind of attributes they hold in high esteem and strive to emulate in pursuit of bettering themselves becoming the transcendent doto master they know they're destined to be.\n\nAlthough it seems at first to be a team game of 5v5, this is a very shallow perspective which will correct itself after around fifteen minutes of your first game. Same goes for the goal of destroying the other teams towers, barracks and ancient. These objectives are simply filler while you forcibly and decisively assert your rightful dominance over your team via your mic or hastily written yet crushingly witty remarks in the chat. (don't worry about the other team, they're fighting amongst themselves and don't matter anyway – remember: you're better than your team-mates and it's inconceivable that there's any possibility you did or will ever do anything wrong, regardless of what may be transpiring before your very eyes.)\n\nThe interface and mini-map should be largely ignored in favour of committing your attention wholly to the chat box, here you can see the current state of the game clearer than anywhere else, it may take a while to understand some of the games many colloquialisms such as '♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ блять' and 'no courier gg my team are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ff', but don't worry if you can't understand, it's not so much about comprehension as asserting your right to say things that don't need to be said and are generally trivial and unhelpful.\n\nIf you find yourself doing poorly and being shouted at by your team for feeding, don't fret. They are likely jealous of your superior skills and can't understand that they are actually the ones letting you down. Just remind yourself of that one game you had that went freakishly well and make fun of someone’s build.\n\n10/10 worst game ever.","January 3, 2015","false","072.0"," 108 of 152 people (71%) found this review helpful 49 people found this review funny","71","108","152","49","4"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepastisbeyondrecovery/recommended/570/","thepastisbeyondrecovery","Vic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thepastisbeyondrecovery/","690 products in account","Dota 2 is the semi-sequel/remake/re-release/evolution of the long-running WarCraft 3 mod Defense of the Ancients, which in itself was based on a custom map for StarCraft called Aeons of Strife. After the release of the original Dota map in 2003, the WarCraft 3 community began producing a long line of Dota spin-offs, sequels and mods (just as Eul, Dota's creator, had used AoS as inspiration for Dota itself), which culminated in the release of DotA: Allstars by Steve "Guinsoo" Feak.\n\nAllstars would become the most dominant and consistently updated version of all the Dota maps and mods. In 2005, Guinsoo passed the torch to the enigmatic IceFrog, who has been supporting, updating, and shaping Dota ever since. His changes have been the most significant, the most popular (the mod grew more during his time than ever before), and arguably have benefited and enriched Dota as a whole. By 2010, DotA: Allstars became simply DotA, and IceFrog was showing no signs of stopping. Later that year, Dota 2 was formally announced (with its development spear-headed by both IceFrog and Eul, both of its most important "authors"; its past and present, alike), entered a semi-closed beta in late 2011, and was finally officially released in mid-2013... and the rest is history.\n\nHistory lessons aside, Dota 2 is a game of uncompromising depth and complexity. Though its gameplay intricacies can appear opaque, arbitrary and incomprehensible at first sight, the way these expansive game mechanics interact with one another when exposed to the element of player imperfection is truly remarkable: over a hundred heroes, each with at least four spell-based abilities and all capable of using up to six magical items, from a massive arsenal of over a hundred. Games can last anywhere from 25 to 55 minutes, and possibly far more!\n\nDota's metagame is constantly shifting, and as of writing the game and mod are at total parity through version 6.80, released earlier this year. On top of that, it is completely free to play, with no features locked out to any players whatsoever. Not even cosmetic items, which form the backbone of the game's vast micro-transaction-based economy: these items are freely distributed by Valve to all players through level-based gift drops and random-chance item drops. Free game updates alter the game balance significantly, while introducing new seasonal game modes, and far more. And that's not even scratching the surface of the game's competitive scene, with its many tournaments, its constantly evolving teams and its own storylines, all leading up to the annual Valve-organized grand championship: The International.\n\nIt may be incredibly difficult and frustrating at first, but given time, patience, simple memory and a keen mind, anyone can ultimately come to see Dota as perhaps the most enjoyable, enthralling and captivating game experience ever conceived. Oh, and it's sort of fun[/b].","February 5, 2014","true","072.7"," 49 of 59 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","49","59","0","5"

Your teammates will cater the enemy team, not back you up, and refuse to call missings or place wards. The enemy team will always pick combos or ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ heroes that will make you want to immediately leave the game while your teammates pick 4 carrys after you randomed Phantom Assassin and tell you to buy the wards. Every other game you will get a Russian Pudge picker that feeds 3 kills mid in 5 minutes and immediately ruins all the work you've done last hitting every creep and harassing the enemy out of lane. You'll rage and call "GG" early and trash talk your teammates but you'll still keep playing in hope that the game will turn around. As things start to finally look good, you get bashed 5 times in a row by a faceless void or the Ogre Magi will get a 4x multi-cast on you 2 times in a row while the Nature's prophet is pushing your top barracks.\n\nBut after all the rage inducing pain, you keep playing. You suffer through it for the chance of that amazing, satisfying comeback even though you're 20,000 gold behind the enemy team. Only to have your dreams crushed when the enemy team finally kills your ancient. But you still keep playing due to the feeling you get when you get that rampage that allows you to push to victory. Even so, after the game you'll still rage because of the common chest you get as a reward for your 60 minutes of pain and suffering. When you finally get that mythical you've always wanted, valve will come out with an event that lowers the price and makes it almost worthless.\n\nIt's a drug that once hooked to, is almost impossible to break. You almost don't even realize you're raging and forget that you're telling your best friend how much of a feeding ♥♥♥♥♥♥ he is and how this lost game is because of him when you're the one who has 1 kill and 13 deaths.\n\nYou keep playing in hope that you'll get good enough where you'll be able to play with Dendi or the other pros and you know that'll most likely never happen but you keep playing in hope of it happening one day.\n\nI would not wish this addiction on my worst enemy. But I can't stop you, nor can I stop playing myself.","March 4, 2014","true","673.3"," 42 of 50 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","42","50","0","2"

In the early 2000s, when I had a lot of free time, Quake 3, Elite Force, Jedi Knight 2, et cetra all took up a ton of my time; but as my age progressed, I had less time to dedicate to gaming. Mass Effect 1 and 2 both took about 100 hours away from me; but that was probably the most I'd invested in many years.\n\nI currently have around 500 hours of Dota 2, and don't plan on stopping anytime soon. The gameplay is spectacular, the community is great (I have made more Steam friends on this game than any other), the meta is interesting, the professional scene is a blast to watch, and the game is extremely well supported - especially with the recent Wraith Night/Legion Commander content update.\n\nThe thing is that I'm not great at Dota 2. I've put almost 500 hours in, and there's still more for me to learn - there are still some heroes I have yet to play! It is a lot of investment, but once you 'get' it, you will have an absolute blast.\n\nEDIT: Just updating this now that I've put around 1600 hours in.\n\nI still completely stand by everything that I said previously. The game is super fun, and I'm really enjoying playing with all of the friends I've made in it. I've also experienced some of the negative parts of the community, and they're unfortunate; but I must say that they are far and few between. The community is largely welcoming, and I've made some fantastic friends through it - ones I hang out with in real life now.\n\nDefinitely play the game, the learning curve is steep but entirely worth it.","December 17, 2013","true","122.9"," 54 of 71 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","54","71","0","8"

After this, there is no turning back.\nYou take the blue pill -- the story ends, you wake up in your bed and keep becoming a "pro" Call of Duty player.\nYou take the red pill -- you install the game and I show you why Trump wants to build that wall...\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: Due to recent comments I would like to clear some things than a few people may have misunderstood, because among other things some of them; I cite, "just read the first paragraph of it."...\n\n-I do NOT really think this should be a paid game,\n-I DO think this game should have some kind of regional/language/ping/hardware lock\nbecause it sucks to play with someone who has a 500ms ping in your team and doesn't even speak the same language as you.\n\nAnd YES ,you like it or not, having a person like this in your team increases the possibility of you losing the game, once I got matched with 4 southamericans in a party, this is what happened:\n\n::Join the game, chose Juggernaut.\n::Minute 16, Global 7-21 , me 5-1\n::Tell my team that I got tired of their ♥♥♥♥ and I was going to feed if they didn't came and push mid like a team.\n::Lose the game, I get 8/2/5\n::My team reported me for feeding, literally a guy with 9 deads and 0 kills reported me for intentional feeding...\n::At least enemy team had some compassion for me.\n::Result??, 3-4 reports from my team, 2 commends and 50pts from enemy team.\n\nThat's the day I became racist...","May 7","false","697.2"," 147 of 225 people (65%) found this review helpful 68 people found this review funny","65","147","225","68","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shatterwaltz/recommended/570/","Shatterwaltz","Ibitsu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Shatterwaltz/","257 products in account","Dota stands for "Defense of the Ancients", or as I like to call it, Dota. The two is not to refer to the game being a sequel, which it is, but rather to specify the number of ancients in a game. The objective is to turn it into Dota 1.\nIn Dota, you need to defend an ancient, which is either a tree or a rock depending on your religious affiliation. Since I'm one and two-thirds Bhuddist, I usually end up defending one of them at random, much like all the other players.\nDota is a very unique game, in that includes both offense and defense. There are lots of characters, and all of them are mostly good at different things.\nIn my opinion, the best part of Dota is playing it. This is because Dota is an extremely unique combining many difficult strategies, such as attacking the enemy team's Ancient or defending your own Ancient.\nThe goal of Dota, much like other games, is to win. If you become proficient at this skill, you will win very often, leading to more victories. Scientists show that six out of every three Dota players that win matches tend to be on the winning team when the game is over. This is because winning substantially increases your chances of not losing.\nDota takes a while to learn though, and that is because it is an extremely offensive, yet defensive, game with many complicated nuances, like being a farmer or trying to help your teammates do good. One interesting feature of Dota is that dying is really bad, in the sense that you lose money and time because respawns are really long, like when Halo 3 would just beep at you instead of spawning you and you'd get really angry, except this is an intentional feature intended to spice up the classic innovation of offfense vs. defense vs. offense.\nWhy did I write a third position in that last sentence? Excellent question. There are neutral enemies in the game, and they usually don't do a whole lot except sit there and be neutral. If you don't respect their space, however, you may find that they beging to fight back, much like an offensive form of self-defense.\n\nEarly in a match of Dota, you find yourself buying useful items like tp scrolls, also called Town Portal Scrolls, or Town Portal Scrolls for short. Why did I mention Town Portal Scrolls multiple times? Good question! That is because there are multiple teams.\nOnce you've bought items, you go kill enemy creeps, and they aren't people so it's ethically sound and completely morally fine to do. :) Once you've spilt some blood, or watched as they comically struggle to kill each other for your favor, you may realize that you have more money and have leveled up. That is because creeps are made of gold stitched together by experience and points, and that usually transfers to you after they die. Think of it like inheritance or maybe a n involuntary tribute system.\nOnce you've levelled up and gotten rich, you can buy better items that make you stronger, and then get new abilities like skills, active abilities, passive abilities, or passive-aggressive abilities. These abilities let you hurt creeps and other palyers more effectively, which may or may not be socially acceptable in your region of birth. Please refer to local ethic codes and statutes to determine whether victory is a viable gameplay style for you in your chosen country of choice.\n\nOnce you've become the best all-around person you can be, or at least made some incremental progress down that road that usually takes about an hour on average, (resets between games, so you never get bored) it's time to go tear down the other team's towers (those, like many buildings in the united states, canada, or certain US territories, will fight back and damage you) and then eventually go and destroy their Ancient, which is what the A stands for in Dota. That makes your team the winner, and implies that you are better people in a metaphorical sense than your enemy team counterparts.","November 12, 2013","true","349.5"," 33 of 39 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","33","39","0","6"

The attack and spell animations are all reworked and changed in this version so even for old dota 1 vets there is much to learn that only comes with the experience of engaging in the matches themselves.\n\nIf you can get an invite and you like the MOBA genre you will find far more to like than not.

While having 1000+ hours played in LoL, and developing a strong hatred for the spanish and any other culture that speaks something close to spanish, this game has also made me develop a hatred for the russian community. As you can see, I've only played 50 odd hours of this game at the time this review was made, but if I had to add at least ONE positive note to this review, its this. I've mananged to learn russian in only a few hours, grasping the most important phrase, "♥♥♥♥ blyat". This phrase runs through my mind, every day of every minute. I sometimes even say it to myself in my head IRL when I see someone doing something moronic. This game is a russian weapon developed by Putin himself to enslave the world, along with the help of whatever leader Brazil has right now.\n\nWhile most of the friends I play with play LoL, I quit that in order to seek refuge from the spanish epidemic there is over there, but instead, have been sucked into this South America/Russian racism simulator wasting most of the extra money I have on steam to buy cosmetic items for heroes I've just played.\n\nI never liked history when in school, I hated it, with a passion, just like the Americans with their hatred for the Russians. This game has taught me everything I need to know on why to hate russia, how to hate russia and question the very existance of that country based on the ape like intelligence that I've seen coming from the country.\n\nIn short, if you've always been a saint in your life, never swore, never hated another culture, never thought of abusing everyone you know that doesn't speak english that well, then I'd suggest not playing MOBA's entirely, all jokes aside. If cancer had to be a game, this would be it. Without a thought. What valve has done, is develop a way of making World War 3 possible. Along with the help of Putin, and his various ape test subjects that I've encountered in the game.\n\n11/10 would keep playing.","June 21, 2014","true","123.9"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","29","33","0","5"

IF a hero gets picked too much in the pro scene , icefrog will nerf the ♥♥♥♥ out of that hero and make it unplayable (Exp:Ember Spirit). Or he just buffs a hero like Riki since the day he came in  Dota 2 (Riki is generally easy to counter in high skill pubs but he wrecks the ♥♥♥♥ out of new players) and nerf a hero like Crystal Maiden both nerfing her damage movespeed etc.\n\n2)THE ♥♥♥♥ING COMMUNITY+MATCHMAKING (+Russians on English Lang.) AND RANKED\nAaand here we are at the best part of Dota , the community... It is filled with immature kids who will rage at you and say stupid ♥♥♥♥ like ''omfg u so noob'' ''learn2play ♥♥♥♥♥♥'' ''y u use midas on big creep'' , it's literally cancer for someone sensitive aganist stupidity . Believe me after spending hours and hours inside those people you will slowly become one of them or atleast it will cause depression + anger issues.\nRanked system of Dota is just simply broken. There is no difference between a 3.5k player and a 1k player , it is all the same. The points are just there so some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ can brag about his non existent 6k mmr lie.(Hell i typed a comment under a vid related to Dota some guy just came in and said he had 6k and you are a ♥♥♥♥ing noob you should kill myself omfg)\nAnd the public matchmaking, slightly better than ranked a little bit because 1 out of a KAJILLION BILLION CHANCE you can actually meet with people who are funny and nice to play with (i made a lot of friends like this) but believe me most of the time you pick EU server with ENG language you will get Russians who farm Dagon on CM in hardlane and never communicate with you. You will slightly learn Russian because these guys never speak English even if they know it and since they love to scream in mic (like idi nahuy pidor suka blyat padaroshnik pizdec bla bla bla...) you will instantly learn MOTTHEEERR RRRRUSSIA ACCENT.+Either you will get (Not being racist here , but Dota really does make you racist) Esta muerto mexican fellas , Spanish people on American server (or Russians with 9000 ping).\n\nBtw don't ever write guides like I did. I innocently wanted to help the other new players with a few guides about the heroes I know really well. Some Armenian kid called me a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ with his poor English. (For telling people to use Midas on the big creep in jungle camps to get a level advantage)\n\n3)Lastly (Because i dont need to say anything more why this game is so piece of ♥♥♥♥) the ♥♥♥♥ing effects on you...\nWhy do you even want to play this game , it is like eating an apple with 4000 worms inside.\nAnyways arguing with a Dota player made me realise that this game completely destroys your social life and your ability  to think, go try it yourself try to say something opposite to these ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s...\n(There is a big ''real life'' world for you to discover out here. Get a hobby instead of playing this.)\n\n\nSo im done please never ever ever start playing this game.","October 8, 2014","false","540.9"," 71 of 106 people (67%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","67","71","106","3","15"

Never have I played a game that has made experience such pure rage towards other players and towards myself.\nPROS\n-Team based mechanics that require cooperation\n-Punishment systems for people who grief or abandon\n-Good art, lore, and character design\n-Large, free roster of playable characters\n-A Valve spin off of the orignial DotA, a Warcraft III mod\n-Cosmetics\nCONS\n-Crappy, boring tutorial and does not prepare new players\n-Terrible match making system\n-Broken ♥♥♥ gameplay\n-No true skillshots (With the exception of Meat Hook, Hookshot, and Sacred Arrow)\n-Support heroes are generally unattractive and no one wants to buy wards or courier\n-Exessive intentional counter picking which ruins your game from the very beginning\n-Filled with people from different nationalities who do not speak English (usually Russains) which means communication\n-Lots of griefers and trolls who threaten to feed, abandon, or simply say "mid or feed" and claim the middle lane by their divine right, usually resulting in them feeding the enemy team and never ganking if they are arrogant\n-Pubs are awful and unless you queue with a friend you will most likely suffer by yourself\n-100% team game meaning it requires synergy and cooperations (which most pub teams don't possess)\n-The game is super addictive and you wont want to shut down the game and do something else unless you are pretty much forced to (You wont even want to get up to eat or ♥♥♥♥)\n-Harsh, cruel community in-game and out of game (Even towards the game's devs: "Diretide 2013" incident, "Lucky Alpine Stalker Set" controversy, etc.)\n-Cosmetics (Yes it's a con aswell due to the fact that it ushers in a wave of casual players who don't really care about actually gameplay)\nThis game has some good points but the cons clearly outweigh the pros.

A game with a massive learning curve that requires nothing apart from your game knowledge and good habits to excel at.\n\nDon't get into this game if you're not willing to learn a lot or sacrifice plenty of your time.\n\nOnce you reach a high skill level, you understand the game at its core and you also find the right people to play with this game is the most enjoyable game you can possibly play.

I only recommend you this game if you love MOBAs, but I didn't like MOBAs and now I have 1200 hours in it. I was a COD player, an MW2 player. Of course you will not be ''pro'' in your first matches. To be good you need a lot of training. If you played LoL and you have 30 lvl its sure you know the "basics". In this game the most important thing is the "Last Hitting" at the start, because if you have more gold and XP than your enemy, you own the game. The game may be boring, but if you have friends it won't be. I think the boring part is the first 13 lvl because you can't play some gamemodes before that. If you are new here you need to complete the training! If you are totally new here completing the training will get you a Sniper set. No the setts doesn't give you any bonus, just the enemy can see how rich you are. These decorative items have degree: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Mythical, Immortal, Old and Arcane. This items can be Normal, Auspicious, Heroic, Cursed and Unusual. So these were the decorative items lets talk about the in-game items! You start with 625 gold each hero have their own item build. I recommend you the Healing Slave, Tango and clarity items, this items will fill your HP or your mana. If you are new or never played that hero before i recommend you the guides (Up left the book icon). I recommend you the GreyShark(RU/UA) builds or Purge(ENG) builds.\nThank you for reading this review. #P3D0'#Hungarian#DotA2fan","July 7, 2014","true","777.7"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

All this long to find, in a relatively short time, a team more or less sets of people with whom it is possible to cooperate and communicate effectively, since the nature of the deep tactical gameplay makes it almost impossible to be accompanied by casual players and hope to derive mutual benefit and fun, especially in the long term. Now that DOTA 2 is available for all, the challenge of numbers with the main competitor League of Legends can begin. In the face of a rock starting even steeper, Valve from its experience exceptionally balanced and truly free from the need to open your wallet, not counting infrastructure for the live broadcast of the games can be the envy of every Another developer MOBA.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vandal19/recommended/570/","Vandal19","Vandal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vandal19/","130 products in account","I've played this game since it was a mod for Warcraft, and I have to say, it's one of the best games I've ever played {mechanics wise}. However, it has more than it's fair share of problems.\n\nFor starters, this game has a stupidly high learning curve. There's no one true way to play any of the 100+ heroes, and it can get very frustrating very fast trying to find what you can easily work with for any of them with the gigantic selection of items. Other than a small pool of heroes that I'm confident enough with to pick on a regular basis, the largest part of the roster is alien to me, with my success {or lack thereof, which is normally the case} depending largely on the skill level of the enemy team and my teammates. Which brings us to the next point.\n\n90% of the people who play this game are stupid. Now, I'm by far not the best at this game. I'm slightly above average at best, absolute best. However, it's hard to improve myself, or even play on anything outside of solo bot servers when I'm constantly thrown in with stupid people, first timers, people who don't speak the server regions language, people who are only there to prance around in costumes, or don't want to follow simple orders/use common sense. Or any combination of the above. Meanwhile, I can rest assured that my opponents will almost always have their act together, and be an unstoppable force that I futilely try to at least hinder. Which is made even harder when my teammates insist on throwing themselves into unwinnable battles, further feeding the enemy until the point where there's a 10+ level gap between me and the lowest leveled enemy. On the other hand, I might go up against a team that's super bad. As in, it's a game that lasts less than 20 minutes. In which case, I've learned nothing, and my time is wasted just as thoroughly as it would be against people out of my league. Or, on the {insanely rare} occasion that I get teammates that know what they're doing, I can expect them to whine about my choice of hero, my starting items/abilities, my lane choice, or god forbid, my costume. At which point, 9/10 of these people will purposefully feed the enemy or go afk, and then either rage quit or spend the rest of the match trolling and flaming. Or they might report me to try and get me thrown into low priority, which is Dota's equivalent of hell. And unlike most other multiplayer games, theres no dropping out whenever you wish without taking a heavy penalty for doing so. So have fun being in matches where there will be almost no fun a majority of the time.\n\nNow, there is a report system, which in theory, is supposed to shoo away the people that don't need to be playing this in the first place. In practice, it's horribly broken, due to being automated. Doing amazingly well, but you're the odd man out in a Peruvian 4 stack that you've somehow managed to offend? Expect to have the low priority message pop up when you exit to the menu after the match. Or maybe you want to report that 0/25 Treant that refused to do his job, and started purposely dying to feed the enemy. The entire server could report him, but he could still easily slip through without getting lp. In all seriousness, it's down to luck if it does work when it's needed, and doesn't when it's being abused.\n\nUp next, hero balance. Thankfully, this isn't quite as bad as it could be, but there is still silliness here and there. Some heroes have one or two overpowered abilities, while others are all around unbalanced, and others still are in sore need of buffing. At the same time, some heroes are nicely balanced, but are easily outclassed by other heroes who can perform the same role, only much better and easier. Why pick Legion Commander and eventually out damage the enemy team using skill, when you can pick Ursa and out damage them from level 3 onwards and rarely have to press more than one button? Why pick Weaver and alternate between your 2 escapes when you can pick Storm Spirit and have an escape with no cooldown? Why pick Centaur Warrunner to be durable when you can pick Axe and be so durable that the lane gets locked down for your enemy? There's tons of examples like this. Also, you'll see some heroes almost every match, {Pudge, Sniper, Zeus, who all have skills that can be more or less mindlessly spammed/have low risk high reward play styles.} but lots are seen rarely outside of higher tier comp play {Io, Meepo, Dark Seer, who all take some degree of skill/have high risk decent reward play styles}. What it sadly boils down to is, why play a hero where you have more than 1 button to press and risk being overwhelmed but have a more rewarding experience, when you can pick a hero that more or less does the same thing, but with less complexity? And none of it is helped by Valve making nonsensical buffs and nerfs, almost all of which are based on tournaments, what with them either hammering heroes that are frequently picked/do really well, and overly buffing heroes that aren't picked often to encourage picking them.\n\nAs with TF2, Valve is rapidly turning this into another hat simulator. I played a ton of the original Dota, and I sure don't remember any customization, because that would have been silly. This game is hard enough without your idiot teammates being distracted by someone's super pimped out loadout, or worrying about getting a nice drop {if any, only 2-3 people usually get drops at the end of the round}. The main problem with character customization though, is that much like TF2, it attracts half wits that only want to play the super easy characters and dress them up, then look down on everyone else who isn't wearing a 20c wolf hat. Yeah, take your little wolf hat into a ranked match, and see how they like it. Also like TF2, Valve focuses more on cosmetic items than the actual gameplay itself, which started off small, but in recent months has led to them:\n1. Canceling popular game modes, in order to {in their own words} 'focus more on cosmetic sets'.\n2. Building entire game modes around expensive sets {although in fairness, said sets only enhanced the modes/tracked stats for them, but still...}, or just flat out making new modes pay to win {the Year Beast Brawl was p2w to the point that disgusting amounts of money and cheap tactics trumped genuine skill almost 100% of the time}.\n3. Doing inane things like changing the perfectly fine models of heroes, and then using that as an excuse to make more money {Shadow Fiend's model was just fine, but then he got a redesign that looked like an angsty 12 year old made it, and a $35 cosmetic that looked like an even more angsty 10 year old designed it}.\n4. Possibly the worst, outright ignoring critical server issues to focus on cosmetic item bugs {also during the YBB, Valve ignored their own failing servers that were crashing every 10 or so minutes, and instead focused all of their efforts on making sure Crystal Maiden's hair didn't despawn when she died. No, really, word for word, the note in that patch was "Fixed a rare, yet extremely common, embarrassing hair problem for Crystal Maiden"}.\n\nOverall, the game would be greatly improved if Valve would do the following things:\n1. Mandatory region locking for everyone, to heavily cut down on the language barrier.\n2. Making the tutorial required for new players.\n3. Restricting pvp until profile level 5, and ranked matches until at least 20, both to make it harder for new players to come in with zero idea of how to play in a live match, and to make it harder on smurfers who only live to troll ranked.\n4. Rather than adding new cosmetics every week, finally adding the remaining heroes from the mod, as well as much needed balancing for all the heroes.\n\nAs fun as this game is, I reccomend it to no one, other than someone willing to go through absolute misery to occasionally have fun.","June 14, 2015","false","396.4"," 34 of 46 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","34","46","2","2"

First I would like to introduce myself :) . OK my name is etro, who has a hobby of playing a lot of games like skyrim, minecraft,pokemon, and etc. OK here's the point when I played dota 1, the first try of the game was hard and I really can't understand it very much. The moment I played dota 2 , that's how I realize and understands the game so the thing that I'am saying dota2 or valve can explain better than dota 1 (no offense , ice frog) so I would gladly recommend playing dota2 than dota 1 for the first try of the game :).\n\n\nOthers say that dota 2 is not a good game or a bad game (well we all have our opinions :) ). For me it's the best game of all the time :D. I respect the Lol (league of legends) players. Even though they are saying that dota 2 sucks. Here in my country (philippines) many Filipinos say that they like Lol better. But I really don't get their point I mean (no offense to the Lol makers and producers) but Lol kinda copied dota 1 ( I don't even know if Lol have their permissions or paid icefrog for copying the main idea of dota) but valve paid icefrog for dota 2 so it means valve have their license while Lol doesn't have. I don't really know guys if Lol really have their permissions or paid icefrog. But I think they didn't ask for permissions or paid ( if im mistaken please correct me or you can just tell me to remove this review. And im sorry if im mistaken that Lol really have their permissions or paid icefrog.but i really think they didnt. Well the real point in this paragraph is I will play or follow the one who have permmisions or paid and that is dota 2 or (valve).\n\n\nIf your noob or getting annoyed it's OK cause we all started like noobs :) and just ignore the people who are saying that you're noob,stupid,idiot, they will just annoy you and they have no hearts (they are monsters). Anyway for them to easily ignored just press the heroes panel at the upper left of the screen. In there you can see a speaker's icon then press it and wahhla you muted the player you chossed. I hope this really helped you guys :)\n\nOK thank you guys for reading my review with this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gambit47/recommended/570/","gambit47","Gambit","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gambit47/","39 products in account","A team game were over 90% of people dont want to cooperate, play as a team, talk, plan, do strats and so on. Game looks good at first, but at the end of the day, its just a horrible online experience. If you have a 5 man stack, with good game knowledge, good coordination, yeah matches can be decent (but i recommend setting up "inhouse matches" with another 5 man stack!!). If you dont have a 5 man stack, its a pub train all day (or just plain bad/noobish). You win 50-5, then you lose 45-7, then you win 41-17, then you lose 60-28 and so on. Its all about the "lucky roll of the dice" named matchmaking. Most players that play this game have lvl 0-1 accounts, with only dota or other free to play games. So dont think if you report them, they care. They just make another account to troll, feed or w/e. Also, alot of people play this game drunk, stoned, or just very tired. That can be ok i guess in a 1v1 game, or a 2v2 with one of their buddies. But in a 5v5 team game, its not nice. They just ruin the experience for alot of other people. Most people use their own language. Chatting or writing. Teamspeak or just skype is not on their menu. So most russians will speak russian, most turks will speak turkish and so on. There is no region lock. Again, for a 1v1 game, maybe that could work. But for a game like dota, having a player from Australia or Peru joining the Euro server with 300-400 ping is not cool. And alot of people just check more servers for faster queue times and also check more languages. So if you check EU West or US East, and expect all people to have good pings and speak english, think again :)). At least some of the dota 2 players, played wc3 or dota 1, dont even get me started with the other mobas... Its the only genre that makes me feel ive wasted my time in most cases when i play the game. Bonus: People either flame/curse etc, or just dont know what the hell they are doing. In most cases both ^_^\n\nSo, i recommend using your free time / gaming time, playing other games. And stay away from all free to play team games / MMO's. They are a magnet for trolls, kids or just noobs that dont care. And you know why? Bcuz they can make 1000 accounts... So if they get banned or their ranking has gone down, its no problem, new acc on the way. Its kinda sad, game could have been fun. But its not. And thigs will never change bcuz of all the reasons ive stated above. The game at its core is good, but the overall online experience is bad. Cant recommend this for a new player, a true newbie. Cant recommend this either for an old skool RTS player. These guys online dont even look at the minimap!! So most of the time the games/matches wont be good and fun. Even most of the wins are fun just bcuz you had fun / a good talk or w/e, with a real life friend that you had on skype, or a gaming friend that you laned with, not bcuz of the dota match tbh. So just go and drink beer with that mate, or just play other games with him/them. With this concept of f2p and team gameplay, i cant see valve fixing this, so i cant see a reason to recommend this. Sure you can get random good matches, but after all my experience playing this, i think you are better off without this game / genre completely.\n\nPeace!","March 12, 2015","false","692.6"," 33 of 46 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","33","46","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/missionvalleygirl/recommended/570/","missionvalleygirl","Delicious Cake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/missionvalleygirl/","47 products in account","One of my favorite games in my library. My play time reflects how much time I have spent appreciating the team work and competitive spirit of the game. Supports who actually support the team, carries who can carry the team to victory, and players who can execute a base push as timely as the New York Sunway. By the way, I love subway sandwiches. I eat a BLT without the T almost every week. Bacon is the most delicious meat. Lettuce is like the cup to the tea party. You can't have tea without water, and you can't hold water without cups. Unless of course you use your hands. Or your mouth. But lettuce cups are pretty delicious. So imagine the bacon and the lettuce together but without the disgusting creatures known as tomatoes. Which while they rhyme with potato, don't taste anything similar. If potatoes tasted like french fries, tomatoes would taste like awful fried wet vegetables.\n\nSpeaking of wet tables, If you put water on tables, it gets wet. Not stuff like multiplication tables that are way too complicated. What is 6X6? Its like 64 or something. Which is like 10 if you add them all together. What does that mean? I am not sure. Math is hard. Unlike DOTA2. Which is a great game. Especially as a carry.\n\nActually I never played carry before. It seems like a pretty easy job though.Just kill things until you win the game. That is a pretty simple job description. Unlike support or mid or offlane or jungle. I mean jungle is a location, how is it a job? It is more like a forest than a jungle. I mean jungles have lions and stuff right? Forests have angry bears. I am not sure where man-birds and horse-men are from though. Horses aren't jungle creatures I think. They sound more like mountain creatures to be honest. I haven't seen a troll before or a gnoll, but I bet they are forest creatures as well too. So jungle should really be called forest.\n\nMid is a pretty self explanatory position. Its the middle of the map lane. Like if you had 3 lanes, he would take the second one. Or she. There are female heroes as well. Are they called heroines? Well I wouldn't want to call anyone a dangerously addicting drug. That would be sexist. I mean playing Lina is pretty addicting though. Fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire .\nIts like if you had a charmander and combined it with a jynx. Thats what lina is. Which reminds me that pokemon recently came out. X and Y are pretty popular with my friends, so I wamt a 3DS. Those things cost money though, but I head I can trade my items for cash. That sounds pretty amazing. Earning money while palying games, its like the American dream for people who don't want actual jobs. Not that I have a job yet. All I do is stay home and read manga. Which is pronounced mane gah, Like mango but with an a. I sometimes forget myself and add a false accent though and pronounce it mahn gaaaa.\n\nSo offlane is the lane opposite of the safe lane. So the dangerous lane as they would call it. It isn't very safe cause you cross the mystical safety river to fight bad guys. Its like chinese vampires and running water. I don't think they can cross running water. Many they would have a hard time with modern day plumbing. One flush of the toilet and the go poof. Or do they? I actually know nothing about chinese vampires. I only know vampires from the books my friends lent me. It was the Twilight saga. I really preferred the Jacob to the other guy though. I was pretty upset when Bella made the wrong choice. I mean who wouldnt want a guy you could play fetch whenever you wanted. Plus the other guy was like 439434 years old. Yuck!\n\nSo Support is the last job you can play. Not only do you provide moral support because most teams don't ever have asupport, but you also help buy buying items no one else in their right minds would buy. Like a slave donkey to carry your items for you. He can even be given magical wings for more than his actual buying price. Why wouldn't I want another donkey instead of one flying one? I am pretty sure two donkeys are cooler than one flying one. I mean how would you even catch a flying donkey? It could poop from like 60 feet and it would be awful. Like a divebombing terrible smelling equine terror. But donkeys are pretty cute. So keep them on the ground. If donkeys were meant to fly, god would have evolved them wings instead of using magic.\n\nSo that is Dota. Its a pretty good game. But it has some problems too. After all, even BLT's have T's. Here are the digusting parts of the BLT.\n\nGames take a while to finish. So if you tend to have sudden gas attacks like me, you might have an accident while you are playing a particular game. A game of Dota can last from as long as 30 seconds to 50 hours. Like I am not even joking how troublesome it is to stay on the toiler for over an house to finish my game of Dota. I mean look at my avatar. That is my face for like the first 5 minutes of Dota before my legs fall asleep and I start getting cramps.\n\nIt also has too many different heroes. I think the game could cut its hero count down to about 7. It would also encourage faster hero picking if the last 3 players couldn't choose any hero. It is a definitely annoying to choose the tree hero and the enemy hero picks an all fire team and the lumberjack hero. You are literally counterpicked because you chose too early. It would be better to give some kind of gold option or a repick option.\n\nSome game modes take forever. Like captains draft can be much shorter if they removed all the bans. Sometimes I want to make team electric, but then a ban comes up and I accidentally ban Mr. Thunder or the masked electric emo. Then Team thunder is ruined. I can understand why bans could be good though. Cause everyone chooses fat butcher guy. He uses his hook to hug you then you smell him to death. Sometimes he tickles you for extra damage. What is worse is that he eats you, he gets fatter and stronger.\n\nThe biggest tomato of the problem is the fact that the game has too much action, but not enough story. Its like worse than Dynasty Warriors when it comes to story. I could use a few cutscenes telling me why I am teaming up with a giant spider, a porcupine, a baby rock, and a angel man. At least there was a reason in Dynasty Warriors 7 about why I am fighting Guan Yu with my hated enemies the filthy Wu. Were those filthy Wu actually even men? The way they fought with their cowardly fire arrows and powerful navy instead of facing the numerically and superiorly led enemy army head on just screams uncultured barbarians.\n\nSo I think I will give the game a 1/10/14. Its a pretty good game, but the lack of story gives it only a 1 in that category. I understand that every hero has its own lore, but the bigger connection is quite lost when I team up with my biggest rival against my best friend. A 10 grade for the excellent team spirit of the game. People play like men instead of filthy Wu women.\n\nBut Ali, why the 14 and not a 17? Because the game has that huge tomato. And I hate Tomatoes. I love BLT's without the T. BL is the greatest invention of man, till someone introduced the uncessary T. I would have BL everyday if I could afford it, but I have no job and spend all my time reading manga.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","January 10, 2014","true","14.4"," 30 of 42 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","30","42","0","4"

I hate it with a passion >:(\n\nIt is not that the game itself is bad - really, it is rather fun (albeit somewhat repetitive given the lack of change in the battlemap - same map, every time. Same hide-spots, same store locations, etc. - though during events sometimes some minor artistic features will be changed).\nIn any case, a simple game as far as setting variety (or lack thereof) goes, but a neat idea. Lots of variation with the heroes, though some are considerably more powerful than others - not the best job balancing them, in my opinion.\n\nThe problem with Dota 2 is really the community, which is LoL-style atrocious. In all the times I played Dota 2, I met a grand total of 2 friendly people (both in Bot matches). I met a massive number of people who were just downright nasty. Pushy, demanding, immature (not in the fun way), unnecessarily combative. Just unpleasant to work with - not that there ever seemed to be much teamwork in this "team" game.\nI suspect the atrocious community is why steam added the reporting system, but really that just made things worse. The system is frequently abused, leading to players constantly reporting each other for made up things "just because", or out of bitterness at losing, or because you don't switch (upon their demand) to speaking Spanish/Russian in the English-language-filtered server, etc.\nThis over-reporting wouldn't be an issue if steam actually followed up to see if the reports had any merit (and maybe removed the reporting option from players who constantly sling false accusations) - but from what I've seen there appears to be no such oversight (hardly surprising - there really is no incentive for valve to follow up).\nGetting reported kicks you into "low priority" matches, which basically means that you have to go up against humans (other players in this awful community) who have also been reported and kicked into low priority. There is a certain number of matches you must play in low priority before you are free to once more play the matches you want (also locks you out of bot matches). There doesn't seem to be any appeals process for this.\nOh, you can also get shuttled into low priority for spending "too long" without getting experience. So, if you are playing Techies (one of the heroes) and want to go out and spend a few minutes planting mines, the game may just decide that you have "abandoned" and kick you into low priority.\nAnyway, I think I've wasted about enough of my time warning you off.\nIt's a free game (last I checked), so I imagine you'll download and play it anyway. Be my guest. Maybe these things won't bother you :)","June 21, 2015","false","163.7"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","22","28","0","0"

The gameplay is, as a result, solid, and every sessions provides new opportunities for fun and strategy.\n\nThe UI is a little underpopulated, however, and doesn't explain much. learning how to do some of the functional things, like leaving a game that's safe to leave, or muting people, or reporting people, are not super intuitive: you have to dig. Furthermore, the options available, though very powerful and plentiful, are not explained super well. As a result, it's important to toy around with your settings a bit, which can be a hassle.\n\nAs far as the F2P model goes, it's pretty fair: you can play the whole game without needing any of the micro transactions. The only thing they do is customize your aethetics, and happily not to an extreme extent.\n\nBecause of this, the game has a really unified look despite all the different items your characters can wear. This might dissuade people from buying them, because some of the items are barely even visible.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone with a hankering for a challenge. The game is NOT easy, but it is worthwhile and a lot of fun once you get a hang of things.

Your team on the other hand will fight over the mid position, pick 5 cores, purchase no wards ,fail to rotate on ganks and you won’t have a courier till the 35 minute mark.\n3) If you play with your friends they will slowly break all ties from you. This is because of the constant aggressive verbal directions and abuse you will hurdle at them over the course.\n4) Dota2 is like a drug addiction. You will be always chasing that first high. In reality it’s a flaming piece of ♥♥♥♥. You end up depressed, jobless and friendless.\n5) Now that I reflect on the total hours I’ve spent on this game, I could have done something useful in my life – Like get a University degree, or learn a new skillset.","December 19, 2014","true","779.4"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","85","17","20","4","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SyndicateXVII/recommended/570/","SyndicateXVII","Syndicate XVII","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SyndicateXVII/","225 products in account","Product received for free\n\nDota 2 is hard, but there's a huge reward for those who commit. On the surface, the game is a like-for-like reproduction of the genre-creating (and still updated) Defense of the Ancients modification for Warcraft III, now transferred into Valve's Source engine. The game's punishing design is sometimes enough to drive you up the wall, but it's worth sticking the hours in: success in Dota 2 is about learning to effectively juggle both the broad strokes and finer details.\nIf you're not aware of the basics of the burgeoning MOBA genre, two teams of five players spawn on corners of a map.\n\nEach team needs to work together with the goal of ultimately destroying a central structure--in Dota 2's case, the Ancient--in the opposing team's base. With most games lasting around the 40-minute mark, and occasionally edging past an hour, watching the enemy fortress dramatically crumble and sink to the ground feels like an exhilarating payoff.\nAiding these two teams, named the Radiant and the Dire, are waves of AI assistants, called creeps. Batches of creeps spawn at 30-second intervals and charge merrily up the map's three pathways. In the clumps of remaining land lies a jungle, where numerous AI opponents spawn, offering lucrative benefits to players who take them on successfully. Finally, and in a bid to stop both teams from simply marching into one another's base, each team gets three powerful towers on each lane that easily shred through enemy players at the start of the game.\n\nYour individual ability to control and affect the rhythm of the game comes from how well you handle your hero. You mostly control a single unit in Dota 2, though there are exceptions: some heroes can summon controllable allies, such as bears, gargoyle babies, or wolves; one exceptionally versatile hero can split into three; and one item lets you take control of certain creeps. For each rule in Dota 2's impressive house-of-cards design, there's usually at least one character who completely ignores it, or finds a way around it via one of 130-odd items available from the in-match shop. For instance, try negating magic attacks with the black king bar, returning damage with the blade mail, or pounding out two ultimate abilities in quick succession with a refresher orb.\n\nThe aim for most players is to accumulate as much gold and experience as possible, with income being delivered mostly by scoring the killing blow on enemy creeps and players. It's almost always easier to gang up on stray enemies as a group, which is why it's rarely a good idea to run about on your own. Then it's a case of splashing all your hard-earned money on some ultra-powerful items from the shop, while levelling up your base stats and abilities, and then clobbering the enemy team into submission via a few five-versus-five team fights. Rarely does it feel that simple, however.\n\nAt the time of writing, 102 of the original Dota's 112 heroes have made their way into the sequel. Each hero has a handful of unique abilities and generally works best in a specific role, such as supporting other players as Omniknight, roaming around the map looking for opportunistic kills as Spirit Breaker, or evolving throughout the course of the game into an all-powerful vehicle of carnage and destruction as Phantom Assassin.\n\nThere's only one map, unlike in many other MOBA titles, although Valve has not ruled out the addition of more over time, and has previously offered game-changing modes with seasonal events at Halloween and Christmas. But Dota 2's single sprawling map sets itself apart from the competition by being larger, more intricate, and packed with greater detail than the rest of the genre. Unlike in League of Legends, the jungle area is riddled with far more tangling pathways, the lanes feature additional shops selling exclusive items, and savvy players are given more opportunities to use the environment to hide, flee, and ambush their opponents.\n\nThere are multiple layers of additional information that become increasingly relevant as you invest more time in the game. How do you effectively divide your forces? When should your team attempt to vanquish Roshan, the map's most powerful creep? What are runes? What's the significance of the fact that creeps get slightly stronger every seven and a half minutes?\n\nOften the game's dizzying scale is seen as off-putting or simply too complex, but the truth of Dota is that it can be entertaining as a new player to just sit down and let all those extraneous factors play out around you. Getting down to the brass tacks of the game with a group of like-minded friends is a lot of fun: start by buying your characters' recommended items, try your best not to get caught out of position, and get into the habit of buying observer wards. And watch out for Riki.\n\nAs you'd expect from Valve, this is a beautifully presented game, with the Half-Life and Portal maker running victory laps around its competition in terms of UI, voice acting, and showing how to deftly add real personality to its characters. Only recently has the developer turned its attention to gently easing new players into the proceedings, however, and even now, mastering the basics feels like learning to swim by jumping in at the deep end. Efforts are being made to remedy this, though: right now there are a couple of tutorial levels, some well-designed AI bots, and a newbie playlist that restricts hero selection to just 20 of the most frequently picked characters. And with community-created hero guides now built directly into the game itself, Dota 2 is much easier to get started with than it has been in the past.\n\nPlay a match every evening for a couple of weeks, and you start to see how Dota 2's wealth of disparate systems and mechanics combine into their own harmony, and you begin to understand how there are hundreds of elements that affect the game. Dota 2 is a tense war of accumulation and attrition. The biggest problem, which is coincidentally where the real excitement of the game lies, comes from struggling to process and interpret dozens upon dozens of mitigating circumstances while simultaneously trying to keep your cool.\n\nIt is a complicated and exhausting game, and for the first few weeks, it's challenging just keeping up with the general rhythm of a match. But invest enough time into Dota 2, and you develop an almost unconscious ability to keep up with the game--performing actions such as sending the slightly fiddly in-game courier over to the faraway "secret" shop to get some rare items, for instance. After a couple of hundred hours of Dota 2, what once felt like spinning plates just happens automatically.\n\nWhile Dota 2 has transferred the core of the original Dota into a cleaner, modern engine, the fact remains that losing is uniquely painful. Death in Dota 2 not only gives your opponent money, but robs you of some of your own and leaves you waiting up to a minute to respawn. By the time you've trudged back across the game's massive map--or spent money on a teleportation scroll--your opponent is now stronger and richer. Die two or three times in quick succession, which is easily done, and a match of Dota becomes a painful experience where you spend the next half hour getting bullied by an increasingly superior enemy. Other games in the genre have tried to mitigate this punishment, but Dota 2 positively revels in its complexities. The rich just get richer.\n\nGive it a go!","May 17","true","145.7"," 57 of 93 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","57","93","5","4"

Basically in tems of speed DotA 2, along with Strife (which is basically DotA 2 in graphics style of LoL with a pet+item system which you can level up by playing) is average, so if you think a MOBA should be slower you should try League of Legends and if you think it should be faster you should try Heroes of Newerth. If you are looking for an alternative that is less knowledge based you should probably try Heroes of the Storm, since you dont have to learn as many item effects.\n\n\nDotA 2 in a "nutshell" after ~2400h of playtime:\n\n-New players (if interested in cosmetic items) will have to visit the shop now because game drops have become so incredibly rare that it has become hilarious.\n\n-IF you buy item chests in the shop and dont get the set you bought it for, you can't sell the items since volvo put a trade+market cooldown (2 months I think) on every new item that gets released (yay!) so if you dont want to spend money until you have each possible drop from that single chest (RNG is strong in this one) you're better off waiting until the desired item is marketable and then buy it off the market.\n\n-Volvo greed simulator: The old loot system, in which you could acutally gain items after a game ,for DotA 2 profile levels, and a leveling chest you had in your inventory (which could be opened every few profile levels and contained a new chest to open later) was successfully reworked into greed-mode. The chances to get ANY items after a game are as low as getting a legendary (or higher) before. Sure they drop ENTIRE sets now, but most of them are common to rare, which overall is still less rewards than before if you add up singe items and put them up against the set drop chance now in both, item quantity AND value. Maybe you should try some "never change a running system" in this particular function.\n\n-Mostly developer/support abandoned game. the new content this game releases is mostly made by the community since the hero sets are workshop based and hero releases/patches are just really really rare. Special events are mostly the same every year and the report system is most likely 100% count-based/not reviewed by support employées (for example if you express your annoyance towards...lets say russians...for not being able to communicate in english on EU servers, you will most likely end up muted because out of the 10 players in a EU game 3 (probably more) are most likely russian and will report you for speaking english)\n\n-These days russian-infested to the max...8/10 games you play will result in eyecancer due to russian chatspam, even though they have their own servers(!) because its way cooler to go to international servers and spam your native language, thanks volvo for letting that happen! maybe one day the EU servers will be renamed into russia 2 and russia 3 and the actual EU will have to play on american servers after all :D\n\n*EDIT*-In addition to the listed issues, the game servers are now absolute ♥♥♥♥! 1/4-1/5 of the games crash and are not counted due to connection issues with the servers, great job of making it even worse when ppl thought that wasn't possible...\n\nConclusion: If you want to play a game in which you get rewarded for playing (in terms of cosmetic effects and/or profile progression) this probably is not the right choice anymore, because as stated you don't get level rewards or similar stuff anymore, just REALLY rare item drops (probably in the 0,2% range).\nIf you want to blow off some steam with trolling other players, spamming your native language while being sure nobody will be able to understand you this might probably be YOUR gamechoice #1. The community these days is mostly toxic and troll based so this is NOT your game for some serious gametime (at least not in solo matchmaking).\nI didnt check the other games these days but the community in HoN was much more friendly and less russian.\n\nIn my personal opinion DotA 2 isn't playable solo anymore because there is too few games where you can actually play properly, without being annoyed by trolls or russians...\n\nGameplay/Balance: 9/10\nCommunity: 2,5/10\nRewards System: 1/10","February 4, 2015","false","532.0"," 24 of 34 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","24","34","2","2"

Most players you encounter will not speak english, so it may benefit you to have a russian, portugese, and spanish dictionary at your side. If you are new to the game DO NOT USE THE BUILDS YOU SEE PROS USE. They build SITUATIONALLY. The builds they use are not good for every situation. At all.\nAlso if you do not take criticism well, Dota2 is not for you. The worst player on your team will blame you for everything that goes wrong. Like seriously if you can't handle an insult play something else. These people are ♥♥♥♥♥.\nRegardless of the community and the lack of Diretide, overall Volvo did a good job on Dota. Graphics are great, mechanics are great, and it is a fun time overall besides the general rudeness of other. There generally are very few bugs with the game and it generally runs very smoothly.\nIf you are new I strongly recommend doing training before anything else, and playing against bots until you are fairly confident in yourself. It takes time for you to fully understand Dota, and no, you can not jump. Hopefully next update you'll be able to (wink wink Volvo).\nUnlike other ♥♥♥♥♥♥ MOBAs *cough cough* League *cough cough* you do not have to spend ANY money on Dota. The only things there is to buy is cosmetic items, which you will be able to get for free as soon as Volvo fixes the drop system.\nI strongly recommend Dota if you don't have friends, a life, or any desire to find love.

This is the first Valve game where I haven't had fun at playing it and made me question their work. After a year of gameplay I can easily say that if you don't play it with friends you can end up with a brain tumor or end up in a nuthouse. You need to play it with friends because it's the only way to enjoy the suffering.\n\nThe artstyle and voices are great, but the gameplay can be a little tricky and it can go unbalanced very easily. The only time where I found the gameplay balanced was in the Greeviling because everyone was in the same level. But the gameplay it's not the biggest issue with this game.\n\nThe community it's REALLY toxic and Valve itself suffered this recently. They are equal or worse than the CoD community.\n\nThe only good thing about this game is the business model. The big difference between Dota 2 with TF2 and CS:GO it's that those games gives you fun and money. This game only gives you money.\n\nNo matter if you win or you lose a match, you will always end up with the same bitter taste.\n\nI only recommend this game for those who lost their minds or just want to make a couple of bucks to buy another game.\n\nIf you are sane, please make a restriction order to anyone who invite you to play it.","November 25, 2013","false","730.1"," 95 of 163 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","95","163","0","1"

Rude, unfriendly community coupled with an overtly pretentious, self-important theme and arbitrary, unnecessarily difficult online play ("laning"? "ganking"? "last-hitting?" REALLY?) are unappealing to me.  I suppose the kids prefer the game this way because they feel like they've "accomplished something" when they win (as opposed to the rest of us who simply "play video games").  As an over-30-year-old gamer with kids of my own, perhaps I'm just too old for this.  Anyway, thumbs down.  NEXT.\n\nEDIT: my 9-year-old just found out "Dota 2" is a thing (thanks, loud-mouthed fourth graders.)  So +1 for "Dota 2" because it's one pc game my kids and I can play together and not worry about off-color game content (as long as we play with bots and not foul-mouthed angry nerds.)\n\nLooks like I *might* be re-installing.......

The blokes over at Vault Corporation did a smashing job to compensate the multinational grocery giants that is Tesco, after the sad tragedy they have faced. The freddo chocolate scandal was in full swing, with millions across the globe losing their trust into this pure MLG juggernaut. Even to this day the poor lads are having trouble with their well lush sales, it makes the Wii U look like a worldwide success. So, in all respect, this is for my absolute ledge of a mate, Brody, who studies a moderate BTEC Sport level 1, all the while still keeping the Tesco flame alive and not from dying out. I'm not here to give you a sob story, because that stuff is gay and I don't swing that way, but first of all, if you're willing to give me a couple of quid, geezer, this money can really give Brody the almighty Cheeky Nando's Peri-Peri feast of his lifetime. Of course, if there's still a little mula left over, it's River Island all the way and probably a cheeky weekend to Ibiza with the boys.\n\nVery much like Country-Steak: Sauce, the first time you start playing, you're reduced to the status of a scrub. The only way you can ultimately get any better is to get the complete ''Cheeky Nando's Starter Pack''. That's all to the game, really. On a serious note though, definitely check out his proper sick game.

I quit, that's the long story short.\n\nWan't a long story long? Well... read ahead then my dear no-lifer (says the one that spends time writing game reviews in Steam)!\n\nSo... where should I start? Of course... from the start! A friend of mine invited me to play this "Super badass game" with him and after days and weeks of pleads I finally bent to his will. Entered the game, all felt fine. He was a pro player and guided me through it. I am also a sharp person that never does anything if he's unprepared so I read a few tons of guides from DotA legends and watched plenty of tournament videos before my first game. I started high above all the newbies and my lerning curve was quite fluent. This means I rarely got to deal with raging idiots, though rarely is not the same as never. Even I that played at a higher level than my matches got raged at from time to time. Imagine how a normal player felt... brainless, super confident brats keep yelling at everyone they don't like (even if he is playing well) that he is terrible and should uninstall the game. Heck, the best guide ever writen for the game starts with a description on how to mute players and how to shield your psych... So yeah, nail number one in DotAs coffin:  The terrible playerbase.  Yeah, there are some nice guys that survived but their numbers are rapidly dwindling and honestly... even the kids at LoL are nicer these days!\n\nWell... DotA could have still sprung out of it's coffin if that was all... but it isn't. Things like the terribly broken matchamking system count as well. Even if you rock you can hardly progress through the ranks and as gamers say "Leave the trench". Since all depends on your partners and you mostly get raging kids and game-abandonig russians (no racism, simply plain facts and statistics, hell I'm a fan of Putin!), you will never be able to roll up enough wins to play with skilled people. Yeah... Valve says it's fair and it doesn't rank your wins/losses but your overall performance in the game... but... yeah, you guessed it, that's pure ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t!\n\nThe heroes... See, the game has this goat fella named Riky that is wrecking public games because of his easy-to playiness and he is overpowered as hell to any unexperienced player (yeah, good ones can counter the ♥♥♥♥ out of him with plenty of heroes). So... instead of getting this guy nerfed (reduce his stats) he is getting boosted with every update. Same goes for plenty of heroes which ruins the game. The balancing of heroes and skills is being lost gradually over time and lately, if you see a certain hero in a team on a pub game you know he will win (and yeah, only jerks pick such... but that's almost all the players you'll meet!). Other heroes that are so fragile and weak like the poor crystal maiden which gets killed 50 times per game are getting nerfed instead... And another nail goes in.\nI can keep this up for quite a bit but I realise readers are dropping off from the review like mosquitoes near "Raid" with every line I add so lets cut it here and shoot the word: The game is duying and unless it gets a restart it will keep degrading. Don't bother... you lose a lot of time playing it, matches take ages at times, no one pauses for you if your mom gets a blackout next to you... well either help her or lose the game... you see?  It's not a good game to play, you won't learn russian (apart from swears)... you wont get smarter (quite the opposite)... you wont make cash unless you sacrifice your whole life to play professionally. You pour so much nerves, time and effort in this game and you get nothing apart from a few and far between games where you actually match with good guys who pick normal heroes and don't spam the mic with swears.  Well the game isn't a ♥♥♥♥ as someone who is on a rage spree might claim... it's a decent one but it's not worth it: I would mark it as a 4.65/10 (yeah, indeed: 4.65... what a nice number) and advice you against playing it. That's all really, excuse my lenghtiness and if you actually read that... well, go reward yourself with a treat from the fridge!","October 9, 2014","false","327.4"," 34 of 53 people (64%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","64","34","53","0","0"

I have been playing a lot of Dota 2 though, because I don't think that Dota 2 is really a "game."\n\nI sometimes lose a game so badly that I wake, days later, in a cold sweat. At first, all I can think is that I am happy to have woken from the nightmare. Later, in a moment of creeping fear, I will realise that the real nightmare is how bad I am at Dota... and yet I cannot stop myself from playing it.\n\nDota 2 is an endless nightmare from which I cannot wake. To install it is to introduce into your life a hellish netherworld, one in which close friends are so disappointed in one another that they cannot even express it. One in which improvement means only that you will be matched against better opposition...\n\nAll of this horror floats on the constant threat of the "low priority queue," a stygian hellscape that this review could never hope to describe.\n\n\n\nSummary: 10/10, would play again (until my sightless eyes drop from their sunken sockets and the cold grip of death frees my mortal husk from its trap).","November 26, 2013","true","049.3"," 31 of 48 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","31","48","0","4"

Enjoy not being able to understand your teammates and swearing at eachother in a variety of Spanish/French (very rarely English) and most of all: Russian. You can play on the Europe West servers (with Russians), American servers (with Russians) or if you're missing out on that full Russian experience, play on the Russian servers. No wonder Ukraine is not taken yet, they're all too busy ''playing'' this game.\nFeel free to enjoy Solo Queue and end up with a group of 3 Russians and a Spanish 13 year old repeatedly, listening to a repeated soliloquy of backwards letters you've only seen once in a Chernobyl documentary. Attempt Duo Queue and end up with 3 Russians, which kind of diminishes the full blown Russian experience; thus I do not recommend you try this or you can play with bots, which are surprisingly better teammates than the Russians. Just for good measure I'll throw in an extra ''Russians'' to get the point across. Enjoy yourself, comrad.\n\nFor those of you that do not enjoy the full Russian gaming experience, there is always CS:GO, which is the softcore version of DotA2.

Love the characters and their unique abilites. (They are also very pretty, especially Luna)\n\nThe game is simple, not hard to learn. If your new, play the tutorials. Focus on your gameplay, find yourself a role, and play it, all the time. Learn yourself all the heroes in the game. Read patches and updates. If you choose to play mid/carry, last hitting is important. Support, usually 2 supports, support your team with vision, buy cour, tp`s, keep the carry safe. Offlane, do not die, drain xp, only last hit when you think you can without dying. At a certain time you should go around helping your team with your abilities, as offlaner. For example if you are playing centaur and got blink, don`t farm anymore, just help out the team. Creating space for your carry is good, letting him/her farm easier.\n\nIt`s the first moba i have tryed and played, and so far i enjoy it. The only thing i don`t enjoy, is watching how people can act so disgusting and negative. I mean, come one, it`s just a game, get over it. There is no reason to be mad by losing, or dying in the game. Just get up, and try again. it`s not that hard. It may be frustrating sometimes, but trust me, its way more frustrating for other people to listen to all your negativity and words you shoudnt have said. Be happy, and others will be as well. Be sad and annoying = youve already lost my friend. And yes, you will meet a lot of stupid people, best way is to just mute them.\n\nTheres a lot of braindead people in this game, wake up, take a red bull, water, whatever..\n\nAnd don`t go around blaming others, think of yourself first, are you even doing good? getting farm? last hits?. And besides, you have only yourself to blame.\n\nAlso russians, learn proper english if you want to play at EUW servers, ty.

You'll rely on your team to preform their selected roles, and then watch in horror as they completely ignore the game mechanics and just chase down kills, rarely successfully. You build in game items during the match to enhance your characters role and then hope and pray your team doesn't feed the opposition too much. Team fights, normally 5v5,  tend not to happen as you watch your fellow team members run to meet their fate and be a hero. Sadly this ends up throwing the game and you lose. I would still recommend this game, purely for those few matches when the your whole teams synergy is in harmony, watch as the gold floods in, the towers crumble and the opposition blame each other for their loss.","July 4, 2014","true","184.1"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","9","9","0","0"

With the release of How to Train your Dragon 2 (which might've been more suitably named "How to be a Dictator 2"), Communist influence has been seeded into the minds of the children, destroying the potential for a perfect laissez faire economy for future generations. How to Train your Dragon 2 is a story of a young Shaggy Rogers discovering the wonders of "Sandwiches" for the first time with the Rottweiler he owned before Scooby. Our protagonist, a rebellious socialist who never came to grasp the true meaning of Republican Motherhood, is a frequenter of the parks, motivating the homeless by promising them peace and beating them until they promise to get a job or preaching to the innocent picnickers about the evils of animal cruelty. A subtheme of gun control is dished out discreetly as the script writers encourage us to do better than what game theorists think we are capable of with flawed moral consciences. In the same way viewers are assured that we have learned from the days of the arms race by subtly bringing up the Marilyn Monroe-JFK scandal. Obnoxious and unorginal, the production draws content heavily from the movies E.T. and Avatar, indicating that it could have been funded by a collective effort between PETA, James Cameron, the public health institute, Heidi Fleiss, and Joseph Stalin. In the end, the main character's tyrannical liberal-minded father boards a boat to Russia under heavy artillery fire by social darwinists, portrayed as defiant and unruly teenagers that want nothing but an end to civilization. I can say with certainty that any child who watches this film WILL become a democrat at some point in their lives, and, like the movie suggests, the only way to prevent the disease from spreading is to contain it.\n\nOh and Dota 2 is a pretty good game too.","June 24, 2014","true","751.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","1"

Why?    Dota 2 has the most toxic and trash community humanly possible.  Every so called pro thinks he plays better than you and dont you dare make a mistake. Even if you have a score of 7-2 and your ''pro'' teammate will have 0-5 he will still tell you how noob and dumb you are. My suggestion if you are looking to play this game is never i MEAN NEVER look at chat and play the game.\nP.S stay away from ranked matches or MMR since its broken and doesnt show any skill rating whatsoever. +25 if you win -25 if you lose and it doesnt matter what score you had or what did you actually did in the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/freaksy/recommended/570/","freaksy","Pepethor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/freaksy/","137 products in account","Why I think Dota 2 sucks but I still play it;\n\n[in short] Slow and laggy controls, full ripoff roster (mainly from Warcraft 3), extremely long matches, toxic community, last hits, kill steals... I'll admit there are some cool stuff in Dota 2 but with all those things mentioned, I shouldn't play this damn thing should I? It doesn't feel fun when I play it, even with friends it feels like a boring chore. But I still play it, why?\n\nWell, here is the list on why I believe Dota 2 makes me play itself [details below];\n\n\n1 - Friends. Playing with friends is fun, sometimes... They invite me over every once in a while, which prevents me from uninstalling the game.\n\n2 - Item drops, seems cool but it creates an illusion of hope. Even though my conscious mind know that it won't drop anything of value, it still has an effect.\n\n3 - That feeling in the end of the match, if I win it feels AWESOME,like I actualy did something good with my life, like I accomplished something. But actually I didn't and it was a waste of time.\n\n4 - The game runs like butter on my PC. For example Heroes of the Storm is 10 times better than Dota 2 but HotS runs at\nlike 20-30 fps, Dota 2 runs at 50-60 fps.\n\n5 - Heroes in Dota 2 are extremely well done. Their dialogues, appearences, costumes, abilities, hero combos etc. are frikin' amazing. But they are all ripped of from WC3, SC2 and D3.\n\nThese were actually good stuff about Dota 2, what is so bad about it that makes me HATE Dota 2?\n\n1 - Controlls are really, I mean really bad. Missclicks happen all the time because of how small hitboxes are compered to for example HotS. People think turn rate is a good thing but it makes the game extremely slow and sluggish. Summoned, enchanted etc. units don't have a mind of their own... They can't cast their abilities on their own... I'm not a baby sitter man, I want to play a game, micromanagement sucks in this game. It's unnacceptable for me because for example in HotS my summoned units have AI and can act on their own. I just point the right way.\n\n2 - No original character. Almost all abilities and heroes are ripped off mainly from Warcraft III. It's so bad in fact, when Blizzard started to make HotS, they had to kindly ask Valve to change some of the heroes names and desings. Everyone knows about Windranger, Wraith King and Venomancer... Slyvanas from WCIII, Skeleton King from D3 and Abathur from Starcraft II.\n\n3 - Farming and it's boring necessities; last hitting is a boring chore, if that's not enough I have to deny enemy from farming as much as possible.\n\n4 - With all these boring chore going on, I don't want the game to last 45-60 mins. Competing games such a Smite and HotS matches only take 30 at worst.\n\n5 - Comminity and it's toxicity. I hate when people tell me what items to buy and do it in most toxic way. Such as "look at this ♥♥♥♥, look which items he bought on his hero LOL". I hate it when people lose their SHET if I accidentaly KS. People go nuts when if I accidentaly get a last hit as a support. Opposing team can be a pain in the ♥♥♥, unpausing the game for example is a big problem. I hate it when I see my own friends go crazy on this game. I hate myself when I find myself yelling at my friends for this CRAP game. I'm not even mentioning Russian players right now...\n\n\n\nI don't want to play this game ever again. I hope HotS will get a decend optimisation soon so that I don't have to even consider wasting my time on this garbage.\n\n\n--Feedback Update 03.06.2016--\n\nAfter a few months I returned to Dota 2. I realised that Dota 2 and Hots are very different games in many aspects. I enjoy both for very different reasons. Still think Dota 2 is not my thing though.","September 26, 2015","false","303.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","11","13","2","1"

You will love every minute of the complex, well made mechanics that you can tell took people a long time to create and put love into. Definatly not pay to win. The reason why I said you SHOULDNT play this game is because of the Community. Everyone is a jerk. Lower ranking games consist of horrible people who have no idea what they are doing, so they blame everyone els on the team. THIS IS ALMOST EVERY GAME. These people make it INCREDIBLY hard to move up or learn from your mistakes because the one guy who has a lot of kills but doesnt help the team in any way is yelling at you. Its just amazing how horrible people are at this game, but are quick to judge. My suggestion is to SKIP this game  because what ever time, place or day you decide to get on to play this BEAUTIFUL game there will be someone who will put you in a bad mood. The only valid way to play this game is to have a group of friends to play with you. If you are missing even one person you will get someone who doesnt want to help you or the team.

Great graphics, amazing sound and voice design, and rich backstories in every corner are just some of the features that make Dota 2 great. But it's major strong point is the depth in its mechanics.\n\nWhile Dota 2's gameplay might seem daunting at first, it's one of the best and more engaging ever seen in a game, and learning it is just one of the reasons why this game is addicting. Other games such as League of Legends end up falling short because their devs decided to cut much from the original formula, but Dota 2 kept it intact, and makes sure you learn something new everyday.\n\nNot only the core game is strong, but also the eSport scene surrounding it is amazing and growing, with several tournaments going on, including Valve's own The International. At the time of release, the game looks like a train with no brakes, about to crash against its competitors and run them over, raising the bar on the genre with a myriad of awesome features that perfectly compliment an awesome game.","October 26, 2014","true","526.4"," 19 of 28 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","19","28","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrMountains/recommended/570/","MrMountains","[CARE] MrMountains","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MrMountains/","387 products in account","Dota 2 is a 5-v-5 MOBA game. You have a selection out of 108 unique heroes, each with a unique skillset. Every hero is also available from the minute you start. No playing X amount of games before this hero becomes available.\n\nThe object of Dota 2 is to destroy the other teams’ Ancient. To do this, you can work your way down any of the 3 lanes (Top, Mid or Bottom) by destroying the outer towers. You’ll start most matches pairing up or going into a lane solo trying to get some experience and gold by last hitting creeps. As the game progresses, you’ll start teaming up more with your other team members to take on the other team or to quickly kill of a solo member of their team.\n\nBecause of the importance of coordinating your attacks with other team members, communication is a very important aspect of the game. I therefor also recommend playing this game with some friends because random people that you’ll be teamed up with won’t always show the same willingness to communicate. If you’re just starting out playing Dota 2, I also recommend playing with a friend who already has some experience in the game because the learning curve is very steep, especially when you have to figure everything out by yourself. The skill ceiling is also extremely high. So every time you play, you might learn something new. Due to the high number of available heroes, skills and items, you can be sure that every game is unique.\n\nSomething to be wary of is the community. There are people out there that take this game way more seriously than you might. Most players have an opinion of what you should have done in a certain situation and will be happy to blame a lost teamfight on you not taking that action. Flaming is something that could happen often. But if you’re playing with a team entirely made up of your friends, this shouldn’t prove to be an issue. If this is not the case, don’t worry. You can always mute the players that are causing you grief and continue enjoying this wonderful, team oriented game.","September 29, 2014","true","994.4"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","3"

But I will say the following generic things:\n\nDota2 is not a simple team game. There are a huge amount of advanced techniques that you will have to be told or lookup online. You come into Dota to have fun with "tools", every character is a different tool. They move different, they turn different, they attack differently. If you enjoy playing the same game over and over and perfecting little, small tricks to give yourself a slight advatange, then this is for you. If you come from any fighting game for example, you can get into this. Like really into this.\n\nWhat makes Dota2 different from other MOBAs? Depth. Dota offers much more variety, much more freedom to experiment. Other MOBAs shy away from the huge complexity that is giving more tools to the tools. You have items that give you more movement options, that take away movement options from the opponent, even random modifiers that spawn on the map periodically. In other games you will find these "options" baked into a character, they try to guide you into learning how a character "should" be played. Dota2 gives you the sandbox to experiment, As a reminder, it's never anyone's fault when you fail to build your tool properly. This is a game. Have fun.\n\nMost people just look up to a player and copy his playstyle, and Valve facilitates this. But you don't have to. Everything depends in Dota2.\n\nShould you try Dota2? Yes. But remember to have fun. You will be playing a game that can last 1 hour per match. Enjoy. Smile. A lot of people forget this. If you're not enjoying Dota2. Uninstall.","December 9, 2014","true","661.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","1"

Based on a third-party modification for Warcraft III, Dota 2 strives to fill the wallets of its developers and empty the wallets of its players. This classic strategy game offers a substantial amount of playable heroes (each with their own unique and blatantly overpowered abilities to fit any playstyle), only one map and a metric buttload of entirely worthless cosmetic items. Being the best video game in existence comes at a price: Dota 2 has a very steep learning curve, requiring an estimated 14 years played before gaining a basic understanding of how the game works and another 30 years to get a very weak grasp of any one hero's hundreds of thousands of spells and abilities. On top of individual skill, this game heavily relies on teamwork, coordination and communication - this ensures that you will get buttraped the first 500 games you play. Also it's free.\n\nRubbish game straight from the bargain bin; 10/10.","July 19, 2014","true","118.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","9","10","6","3"

It seems really stupid, but you suck it up and play through the tutorial. Then you stupidly decide to play your first game of real dota. Put short you fed, badly.\n\nAfter going 0/30 your first game you kinda hate dota. But you stupidly decide to play another, and chances are you lost again.  And this keeps happening until you discover your first newb hero. Drow seems so op doesnt she. Afterwards you decide to play this hero again and again, and doesn't it feel good to win.\n\n50 games deep you'll hate noobstomp heroes like riki, sniper, drow, and bloodseeker. Obvisously these heroes are really op.\n\n100 games deep and you'll find yourself trying out some new heroes, tidehunters ravange is pretty epic you have to agree.\n\n200 games deep and you'll have played every hero, with the exception to earth spirt. How the hell do you play that guy, I dont get it.\n\n300 games deep and those newb stomp heroes dont seem so bad anymore. Manfight riki, stand right next to drow, get blademail for sniper, and buy a tp for bloodseeker. And dont forget to buy dust.\n\n400 games in you will know how to ward, rune control, stack and pull and play a support. You will understand the basics of having one person farm while another supports and harrasses.\n\nHoly ♥♥♥♥ you've made it to 500 games. Remeber your first match if only you could see yourself now. By this point you understand the basics of dota! Remeber to dodge the sunstrike!\n\n600 games in and you'll realize that for the past months dota is the only game you have played. Like the only game, because once you start playing dota you never come back. Unless your power dies....\n\nBy 700 games you'll start playing against trilanes. Now as an offlaner you have to do your best to not die, and get some farm. Hide in the trees and sap xp where you can.\n\nBy 800 your tempted to buy that arcana. Not saying you will but it sure does look tempting.\n\nBy 900 you know what to buy, and you get what every hero can do. You know where to be and when and you get the feeling when there smoke ganking and roshing. Gamesense op!\n\nBy 1000 games you hit a milestone. The game doesnt seem like colored creatures punching eachother.\n\nWelcome to dota 2.\n\nNoob Advice: read guides when your trying out new heroes. Practice in bots, and dont stick to one hero, play them all. And stick in there, your first 10 games will suck. Purge has some great guides that you really should watch before you even step into your first game. And also play with friends, otherwise you might have to put up with peruvians who keep screaming noob in chat when you make one mistake. People who have to rage at everything (thats why theres reports), and russians who will play uber aggresive all the time, which to be fair on there part works half of the time. Welcome to dota 2.\n\nOh yeah and nerf void!\n\n","October 2, 2014","true","055.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

The game works like this ,that there are two teams, first team is called "Radiant", second team is called "Dire" and each team will have a base, that base is called "Ancient", then to win this game you have to destroy there base. So basically the first one to destroy the enemy's ancient wins, but before that you must go through the enemy's towers, there's three tower on each lane, so you can't destroy their ancient if you don't destroy the three towers and you cant advance to the second tower or third tower, you must destroy the first, second and third then finally their ancient. Last thing is , each team will have five players so you and your teammate must cooperate if not you guys will lose instantly the game, then each player will have a to pick a their role. There are 10 roles. After you guys pick a roles. There will be three lanes there's "Mid", "Top", and "Bottom". So it can be like this 1 in the mid, 2 at the top and 2 at the bottom.\n\n10 Roles\nCarry - will bring victory if he levels up faster and makes gold faster.\nSupport - will provide wards and courier, also will upgrade the courier.\nLane Support - useful even without farm and can go to other lanes to help others\nInitiator - will start the teamfight.\nJungle - can get gold in the jungle so the other teammate can solo top/bottom.\nPusher - can push faster through first, second and third tower.\nEscape - can bait the enemy or bring the enemy to your trap.\nDisabler - will stun the enemy or cancel the enemy's spell cast.\nDurable - will tank(shield) the teamfight so he's teammates wont die fast.\nNuker - will bring massive damage too the enemy.\nThis the common role in game, if you have this team you have 50/50 chance of winning\n\nPlayer 1Carrythis role will kill all the enemys and finish the gamePlayer 2Supportthis role will help the carry to farm because the other team will try to kill your carryPlayer 3Durablethis role will help in the teamfight, he will take all the damage of the enemy so the carry will livePlayer 4Initiatorthis role will start the teamfight so you guys will have an advantage of the enemyPlayer 5Disablerthis role will stun the enemy so the enemy can't cast spell or attack\nI hope you like it and I really recommend this game, so good luck and had fun :)\nPls like my review\n\nOriginally posted by author: Steven Baes A.K.A.

Now we can say he had wasted 3660 hours of his lifetime. which is almost 65% of his past 8months.\nEvery human being (if we can call dota players as it ) atleast spend 2hours a day for eating different meals, so in 8months that will be something about 480 hours. now he has been spending 4140 hours of his time to eat, sleep and play dota 2. now it is something more than 80% of his time in last 8months.\nin another word, he has only been living 20% of his lifetime.\n\nso if you ask me, 80% of dota players are addicts and Dota 2 is their drug.\n\nI know tons of people who had lost their friends just because they were always busy playing Dota 2.\n\nSo, if you don't want to be an addict, if you don't want to lose your friends, or generally, if you want to LIVE, just don't install this game. Just don't\n\nI have only ran this game for 10minutes to be able to give this review so I might save a few people who care about living.","January 16","false","0.1"," 21 of 33 people (64%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","64","21","33","8","7"

Also the leavers and the disconnected players are more rampant now. Which make this game more and more unenjoyable now. Noob-calling, negative not-team-players and the blame games involved, yes those kind that you have to expect when playing with total strangers. You'll be wasting 30-45 or even 60+ minutes of your life, thanks to them, losing easily. So this time around, you have to prepare yourself mentally to face those kinds. :D\n\nGood thing is that they have implemented the local lobby feature, so that you can actually play locally within your LAN. Should be a very good game worthy of having a LAN party again.\n\nI like the balance changes they put into the game, the item changes and things that make the early games more "fun", but...\nI'm putting this as a "No" for those who play only with a friend or two. You better play this with a full five-person-team to fully enjoy this game and the time not wasted. Or perhaps due to its current state, players similar to me might not have the reason(s) on how to fully enjoy this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/needformemes/recommended/570/","needformemes","Mega","http://steamcommunity.com/id/needformemes/","48 products in account","Dota 2 is a first person MMO RPG survival horror game developed by EA and EA only where you have to fight to survive in the drunken robot zombie apocalypse with nothing but your bare feet, as your hands are too pre-occupied taking off your panties in excitement for this sick filth.\n\nThe main protagonist is you, Jakob. You are a lone survivor and every other player in the entire damn universe is an enemy. Jakob's model really matches his personality. A hipster, emo, gothic sex-driven male paired with the voice acting of Morgan Freeman really make this character pop out and helps make him really relatable.\n\nThe storyline is great. I love how the developers have a completely separate "prologue" chapter for the story, explaining how such an apocalypse could have ever risen from the deep depths of hell (that's not a spoiler as you see that in the first 15 minutes of the game). You start out in the middle of Россия... er, Russia, spending time with your beloved family, and find out you are really, REALLY attracted to your cousin. You take her out to "show her the world" when suddenly a crack opens from the ground beneath you. Your cousin falls into the crevice. You are devastated. You try to rush home, but then all of a sudden, you hear a big шлеп... er, plop. You look behind you, and there are robot zombies, all drinking vodka. You then turn all around and find yourself surrounded. And I'll stop there, otherwise I may end up spoiling the prologue!\n\nThe PvP in this game is SPOT ON. It's like the developers KNOW that you're the main character and give you the most overpowered arsenal right from the get-go! It's brilliant, need I say more? Fine, I shall! Just like the amazingness that was Dungeon Keeper Mobile, you too can attain the most powerful arsenal by slamming your wallet into EA's pockets! It's fantastic!\n\nThe best part too?

But it was a long time ago when everything started. You know- you came from school to play some good games, start picking and ... OH MY GOOOD! There are no supports and whole your team is speaking some kind of magic language, that you can heard only in fairytales. Yea I am talking about azbuka. And you know, doesen't matter if you checked before finding the game that you wanna play with english speaking people, oh no! It really doesen't matter if you checked EU or NA region, or no... They are everywhere you watch, even in your bed. There is aboslutelly no hope to get anything normall from them. You can just enjoy their mighty "♥♥♥♥" words or glorious "blyat" words for whole game long in your chat. Theese gyus are so good that thay can stay whole game in you base, just sitting their ♥♥♥ and spamming voice chat with that two words. Eventually if you are playing solo and they come as four or three stack, you can next game enjoy your low prio or mute, because of nice reports they made. And yea, I almost forgot about MatchMaking- you can just hope that you will not play with someone who has plyed 4000 hours when you have played like 90 hours. MM here is kind a surprise what you get. But remember you will never play against someone who has 10 hours when you have 1000 not really.

Ranging from the down and dirty Gondar lines like "for the right price, anything" to the drunk, pitiful Mangix; and you thought Disney was bad.\n\nOn top of that they even added a character called "Troll Warlord" which is obviously a Homestuck reference. These guys are really milking the fandom department. Why can't a game just be about boobs like the old day- I mean what ever happened to good old Christian family values like Monopoly and Scrabble. Now we've gotta fill our games with fanservice and sell out to an audience that is somehow greater than ours? I don't think so. And there's even a character that's a flamboyant homosexual. I had to bring my children to therapy after they heard the words "puddin pop" from one such "Storm Spirit".\n\nOn the topic of inappropriate directive, I can't believe a Greek Gorgon such as Medusa would go so far as to talk about her 'gays'. This is simply not alright.\n\nThis "game" is nothing but a manifestation of what our society is becoming, and we can only petition to have Valve remove funding for this project to save our youth.","March 16, 2013","false","114.7"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","62","24","39","7","12"

It's a fun game if played with friends.\nDota 2 requires TeamWork in order to win the game properly. Dota 2 is purely based on Skill. And I said this for four reasons : 1-Counter picking.\n2-Map awareness.\n3-When to start a team fight when to defend.\n4-Picking right items.\nPlus the more you play Dota 2, the more you want to learn about the game, and then you will enjoy playing it more than anytime!\nSo actually Dota 2 is more like a team game. But playing solo is an other story...\nIn solo matchmaking TeamWork is laughable. People will most likely tell you what to do step by step. If you don't follow what they're telling you. [All chat] "report player". Your random teammates will blame you for every single mistake you have done. And they won't even try to help you. They will just start insulting you in [All chat] and this will result to a lost game. I have tried to be nice with all my teammates when playing SOLO but as everytime, it's either I carry the team or I will lose the game. it's my mates attitude, I rarely get to play with people who speaks English properly. I will always get the "♥♥♥♥ squad" spamming in [All chat], "REPORT INVOKER NO GANK!!" "♥♥♥♥ blat, adi nahoo". I'm not quite sure what they're saying, but I'm positive, they're insulting me or my mother, most of the time. Well of course there are nice guys, but they are rare. Overall this game is awesome  and somewhat addictive.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fenghuang/recommended/570/","fenghuang","凤凰","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fenghuang/","64 products in account","2015:\nOver the course of a year, Dota 2 has slowly introduced its Source 2 game client, which allows for easier integration of custom games similar to the original system of Warcraft 3's Battle.net. The International 2015 tournament is also a huge success and has a record $18.4 million, of which $16.8 million were contributed by community spending. Valve has also revealed its future plans for the game in the form of quarterly Majors tournaments that is meant to further develop its competitive scene and community interest.\nIt is also clear that Dota 2 will be taking a seasonal games events approach towards stimulating community support, with obvious targets being December Holidays, Chinese New Year and Halloween.\nWith regards to porting over Dota 1's legacy, there are only 2 heroes left: Arc Warden and Pitlord; and they are likely to be introduced with the aforementioned games events.\nAt this point, the longevity of Dota 2 is very much secured in the foreseeable future due to Valve's Steam Client storefront, massive player base and successful implementation of cosmetic item sales that do not affect gameplay.\n\nIcefrog, you did the right thing by choosing to work with Valve for Dota 2's future back in 2010. I hope that you continue to work on your legacy and enjoy the feelings of joy, happiness, rage, sadness and comradery that you have brought to millions of people worldwide.\n\n\n2014:\nDota 2 just keeps improving over time. At the rate this game is progressing, it is likely that it will still be around 5-10 years later. The community keeps expanding and the content updates are constant and full of exciting new features. Seasonal events bring about new quests and co-op gameplay that make good use of the core game's heroes' abilities. The cosmetic items economy is healthy and ever booming with more and more workshop artists contributing. As a competitive game oriented towards esports, Dota 2's professional scene has certainly expanded exponentially and The International's prizepool over the years can be seen as an indicator. It has grown exponentially from $1.6 million in 2012, to $2.9 million in 2013 and is projected to hit $10 million in 2014.\nDota 2 has also recently implemented Ranked Matchmaking, which allows players the opportunity to play games for an ELO-style rating. While it has exploits and flaws at its debut, the subsequent updates over time have vastly improved the experience. It is a welcome new feature and it enables players interested in a more competitive experience to play to their best abilities, knowing that their teammates and opponents will likely put in the same amount of effort.\n\n\n2013:\nValve Inc. has proven that they will continue to support Dota 2 in all aspects and maintain a healthy esports scene. The game caters to all spectrums of players, be it casual, competitive or spectator.\nMatchmaking system still has its design flaws and the game still lacks a way to convey to competitive players their skill level and standings/ratings.\n\n\n2012:\nDota 2 requires huge player investment, but provides magnificent and immeasurable rewards for commitment.\nhttp://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2012/08/21/dota-2-pt1/\nNow free to play! All heroes are free and available. Items are available for purchase for each individual hero, they do not affect the game balance at all as they are purely cosmetic, and the colors and items fit Dota 2's medieval setting.\n\n\n2011:\nThis is a game for the competitive PC gamers. DOTA 2, the sequel to DotA features better character animations, mechanics, graphics and interface design. The ease of matchmaking, connecting with your friends and playing a cooperative team game all culminate together to make DOTA 2 a complete game experience. No two games are the same and despite this game still being in beta, it is already a great experience akin to other AAA PC games out there.\nThis game is a definite buy for me.

The reason i choose dota over LoL is beacuse of the friendly community and the helpful players i often find in the games who are always willing to help me out if im stuck with what to buy or when they're telling me i shouldn't be initiating teamfights as the courier but whatever this game is great i'd give it a solid 7/10 just beacuse it's such an easy game to pick up after about 100 games you will have the basics mastered like how to last hit the minions and once you have that down you can learn how to kill your own minions to deny gold which is pretty hard and i still can't do it properly. I hope that in the next 20 games or so in can manage to get the basics of jungling down because it's very complicated and i always forget to eat the trees for health LOL. yes would reccomend definately to any new players looking for an online moba game which is really easy to pick up and get going aftert 10 games.","September 22, 2014","true","2.6"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/GilderoyDarling/recommended/570/","GilderoyDarling","Dr. Gilderoy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/GilderoyDarling/","69 products in account",""sooka blyat noob report" - your average friendly Russians\n"Well played!"  - chat bind used in a mocking way\n"DROP YOUR STICK"- EternaLEnVy leading his team in a professional way\n\nDota 2 is the leading game of the MOBA (multiplayer online battle arena) genre developed by Valve Software, released in 2011. In Dota 2, players in teams of five control various heroes and abilities in a bid to utterly crush the enemy in a pointless waste of 30-60 minutes.\n\n* Gameplay\n\nDota 2 largely follows the experience of the original Dota All Stars mod: you pick a hero of your choice and get assigned to the Radiant or Dire (formerly known as Sentinel and Scourge) faction with the objective of destroying the enemy's Ancient. Protecting the Ancients is maintained by towers and barracks which ensure lane equilibrium and creep strength. Heroes are initially very weak and must rely on creeps (faceless grunts) to obtain starting gold from which options to start pushing begin, as well as experience which enables leveling up abilities. Abilities range from:\nDeal damage (and maybe a status effect)\nInflict a positive or negative buff\nArea of effect damage/positive or negative buff\nUtilities\nGlobal effects While laning is the main way to gain gold and experience, alternate choices are fighting neutral creeps in the jungle (usually done by very specific heroes) or challenging the mighty Roshan, who drops the fabled Aegis of the Immortal (resurrect on death). In order to maintain the advantage, certain nuances of the game must be learned:\nLast hitting/denying (ensuring/denying gold and experience)\nCamp stacking (having a single jungle camp hold more creeps than intended)\nCreep pull (having allied and neutral creeps fight each other to shift lane equilibrium)\nMap vision (prevents ambushes)Of course, having a good Dota 2 experience is defined by your teammates, who may be either incompetent or singlehandedly taking on the entire enemy team and winning. Communication and teamwork are vital, thus it is recommended to play with friends, although it doesn't ensure victory.\n\n* Hero roles and balance\n\nEach hero has a set of 4 abilities that have synergy with each other or other heroes' abilities, but more importantly, each has a specific role:\n\nCarry/hard carry - heroes that need a lot of gold and levels to get the ball rolling\nSupport/hard support - heroes that excel at supporting carries in early stage, and usually   buy support items and stack camps\nJungler - heroes that spend early game in jungle, then ambushing lanes at level 6A hero is not forced to follow a role, although using highly unorthodox tactics will most likely earn you the scorn of your team, possibly giving you a trip to the low priority queue, filled with Russians and similar  friendly  people. Dota 2 often changes with large updates that give heroes buffs or nerfs, change certain mechanics or simply iron out bugs and glitches. The most popular heroes tend to be the ones that have an easy way of dominating games, making you have a hard time if they aren't on your team, although learning to counter them is a great learning experience.\n\n* Other interests in Dota 2\n\nIf you get bored (and you will) of right clicking at the time, the game offers the option of following various e-sport leagues, the biggest being the yearly International hosted by Valve, and famous players (such as Dendi, EternaLEnVy and so on) which set many gameplay trends and strategies. There is also the large economy which is mostly based on altering the looks of heroes and the game, but with no pay-to-win options, except maybe gaudy gold cosmetics. Finally, every Chinese New Year/Halloween/Christmas a slightly different game mode is introduced, thus making the game slightly less stale.\n\n* Closing comments\n\nDota 2 is a fairly well made game which offers many hours of play, although the relatively unchanging experience and hostile people may spoil your enjoyment. Personally, I wouldn't suggest getting too involved as you will become highly misanthropic, although I wouldn't say it is a bad game.","July 29, 2015","false","677.8"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","9","11","0","1"

Then the game gets very rewarding and fun.\nPlaying Dota2 is a combination of strategy - which hero to pick, where to lane, what items to buy and satisfying combat, one hero usually has 4 abilities and one of them being there ultimate ability, which is the hero's strongest ability, for newbies, there are a lot of hero's with passives and few abilities.\nSomething, which I don't usually mention in reviews, is the voice acting, this game, although it has 108 different characters, has really good voice acting for every single hero. Although the game is getting to get a bit older now, its graphics are definetly up to date and personally I really like the water, it looks really good.\nOverall if have a lot of spare time and for a very strategic in-depth game go for it!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/onix1/recommended/570/","onix1","Onix1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/onix1/","128 products in account","A maelstrom of anger, fear, disillusionment and sheer ecstasy - Dota 2 is all these things and more. You’ll learn to hate your friends and love random strangers during the forty five minutes of an average match. In that short span of time, grudges will be born, heroes will rise and poor plays will be vilified like a G R R Martin epic. And yet for all its emotional drama, both highs and lows, you’ll still yearn for more.\n\nJust learning to play is an adventure into masochism. Everyone begins as a dreaded n00b, unable to contribute anything but gold and XP to the opposing team. A few weeks later and they’ll have learned a few tricks: where to place wards, how to turn off auto attack in the options and, crucially, the ability to take abuse on the chin without rage quitting. Give it a few months and they’ll be rolling with the regulars. Double stacking, recrowing and GGWP will become part of their vernacular. Immunity to the insults will be delivered upon their chins which have since grown thick with stubble and caloused skin. They'll have succesfully joined an inclusive club whose members include the heroes of the world's burgeoning e-sports scene. Consider the football metaphor, pub matches are like a kick about down the local park using the same boots, strips and footballs Rooney, Messi and Neymar use in packed stadiums full of shouting people.\n\nIf all of the above sounds a bit much then ask yourself: What’s the point of playing if you don’t feel something in the end?  Dota 2 delivers passion and fury in spades, and like all great games its hidden depths forever tease like sirens upon the rocks, always ready to punish an overblown sense of ego. Just don’t look at the item store; your partner/parents/common sense will never understand why you spent $35 on some virtual eye candy for your favourite hero…","June 18, 2014","true","724.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tacet_/recommended/570/","tacet_","Tacet_","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tacet_/","161 products in account","I've been playing DotA 1 since 2003. I switched to DotA 2 a couple months ago from all my friends shifting over. Here is a short list of pros and cons that I have seen in DotA 2 as opposed to DotA 1.\n\nPros:\n* Better mechanics, many heros function differently in DotA 1 due to the restrictions of the Warcraft 3 World Editor.\n* Visually stimulating, DotA 2 has many ways to customize heros, couriers, wards, animations, and more.\n* Item drops, as opposed to DotA 1, even casual players can end up making some money just by playing.\n* Spectating\n* Much easier for new players to learn due to the new system to help starting players.\n* Builds display on the item panel\n* Has many events in which additional items can be earned\n* Has an in game mic system as well as quick toggle phrases.\n\nCons:\n* Currently doesn’t have all the heros or neutral camps that DotA 1 has.\n* Lacks some of the game modes of DotA 1.\n* Surprisingly, lacks some of the important mechanics of DotA 1. The most notable one that I can pull off the top of my head is Batrider’s napalm does not trigger any damage bonus on radiance + veil even when the threshold for doing so is met.\n* Servers tend to be down for a brief period of time after nearly every update.\n* Doesn’t have as well of a language division as DotA 1. I que US east and west with the language of English in DotA 2; yet 1:3 games, if not more, will have another language. I wouldn’t even mind if it was something like Spanish or French, but I am getting everything from Russian, Chinese, Portuguese, Ukraine, Korean, Japanese, and many more that I can’t even identify.\n* Double courier is a lot harder to use in DotA 2, even with hotkeys and grouping. I find this to take away from bottle crowing as well as make it harder for 2 farmers to get their items quickly for they will likely be on the opposite sides of the map. Even if they aren’t, the offlane will still likely need it to get items to survive. Every game will only have 1 courier unless someone accidentally buys another.\nNeutral:\n* DotA 2 has much better pathing and makes it harder to get stuck on unpathable areas. This makes sure you will never stupidly get stuck somewhere, but also takes away from some hero abilities that do move other heroes or yourself.\n* There is currently no public lobby system. There is everything from private, fiends, guild, etc., but there is no way to host them publicly for anyone to join.\n* Your computer needs to be decent to run DotA 2. At least 4 GB of ram and a decent graphics card is highly advised.\n\nIn conclusion, DotA 2 is definitely a f2p game that you should look into. If you have yet to play any MOBA it may seem a bit difficult at first, but it will grow on you. To avoid the initial hate you may come across, I advise having someone assist you with learning the basics or look up some tutorials online. Going into this game with absolutely no knowledge of how this game works is definitely not a good idea. Once you learn the game, it can easily become the most enjoyable strategy game you have ever played.\n","December 22, 2013","true","987.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
