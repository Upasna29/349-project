All I can say so far is this game is creepy. I'm not really into the survival horror genre as a whole, so I really don't have anything to compare this to. However, this game is scary. If your into that sort of thing, even if your not, Its definitely worth picking up.","April 7, 2014","true","1.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Load downstairs in the studio, hear a strange noise, ghost walks past the door next to the kitchen, run in to the room and there's nothing there, get freaked out, go the kitchen and hear another strange noise. The game is a lot of fun with some sort-of jump scares. You know something is going to happen, you just don't know what or when. It's like a real haunted house. The only problem is the game is glitchy and lagging a bit but that's been explained in the game description. So I don't really see any problems with the game.

While there is the occasional jumpscare, there is also a screwed up, randomly decided storyline in which you find out about the house you are currently trapped in. The game features a few glitches, but barely any game-breakers anymore. You find diary pages throughout the game that tell you the backstory of why the house is haunted and there are deep, psycological scares in store. Definitely worth a try if you have a love for the horror genre or are just curious in general.","June 16, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I found myself getting shivers down my spine while simply walking through a room. The general atmosphere and jump scares made it much more enjoyable than something like Slender or another generic game. Even though it is inspired by a terrible movie, it is enjoyable and unique.

Despite the graphics, getting stuck randomly and the look of items and rooms the game was enjoyable. The story was good but due to getting stuck and jumpscares not always appearing or something stopping them the game was harder to complete.\n\nHowever, I have just completely playing the unreal version just now. Everything that gamers of the original game wanted is getting completely. Although updates are slower than other games, the updates are vast and add whole new details to the game. I appreciate that it now takes a little longer for the scares to start happening which I found enjoyable and likeable, to establish the setting and tension. Even with more scares, the game is really good.\nThings to work on are\n- The game rapidly drops in frame rate to 60fps down to 12 fps when I go near the fire or there is a lot of light even with light settings turned down\n- More scares (that’s coming)\n- When answering the phone, the camera battery would often die down very quickly meaning I would have to go to bed. The issue with this is that the audio continues playing and the protagonist continues talking in his sleep\n- The SD card capacity reaches full amount and then I don't know what to do with it\n- The subtitles at the introduction of the games start were too small and didn't notice them until mid-way through the whole speech.\n\nOther than that would 100% recommend while the game is cheaper and it is good to have an audience voice with a dev that cares.\n","May 27","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having to run around your house at night and trying to collect all of the haunting evidence before your camera dies takes away a little bit of the fun of looking for anomolies like moving chairs or random blood scribbles on the walls but this does nothing to diminish the overall enjoyment I had in playing the game.\n\nDefinitely a title to keep an eye on","January 23, 2014","true","2.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Different things happened in each of my three attempts (glitched the first one, failed the second), but this game isn't just jump scares. You literally sweep the house about five times each "day" and scary ♥♥♥♥ leads to more scary ♥♥♥♥ that honestly sent chills down my spine through the whole thing. I've played Slender, and it does not compare at all. SCP Containment Breach manages to keep me on edge. This game takes the cake for terrifying. I got it 50% off with a badge cupon, but would've willingly paid the whole $10 had I known it would be this good. 10/10 I totally recommend this to anyone that doesn't mind a good 15 minutes of goosebumps per playthrough, and I can't wait to see how this game develops.

I've "died" several times on the first episode, and I'm not sure if I'm supposed to do something special...each night you sleep more and more happens, floating furniture, jump scares, doors slamming, random noises, etc...so by night 3 I'm just like "please...just please kill me so I can start over on the nice "peaceful" day one again..." There are certain rooms that I hate touching...just because of the scares, I still love to attempt to play games like this, though most of them I can't play through much before quitting.

Slowly walking down the stairs and suddenly realizing that the couch has been hovering a foot off the ground the whole time is the kind of shock you can't get in a movie or book.\n\nHowever everyone's fears are different so if you enjoyed movies like The Conjuring, Paranormal Activity, and Poltergiest you might want to play this game.

Im a Survial Horror fan, consider myself fairly seasoned to be honest, Ive seen a trend of these POV games, i.e. Slender, Scratchs etc. So, I figured what the heck right? Give this one a go. I gotta tell ya, Its scarey. THIS GAME IS *&$#@^* SCAREY! I didnt think it would be, I mean, Im from the Resident Evil (Old School Res not the new stuff), Silent Hill and Doom generation. I get sleepy durring the Exorcist, I love Horror, but its been dry for several years now. This game, is Epic, from a horror point of view. If you kill the lights, toss in some earbuds and put yourself into this game You .. Will .. get freaked out at least some what. I found a few parts that I was thining "Okay, just ignore it, and move on" ... then something ELSE would kick off. Its not all in your face either, some of it is subtly, some of it is straight sick, and the rest is just very, very well done. My hats off to this game and its devs, I think a lot of AAA developers out there need to take a look and pay attention to the details of a TRUE Haunting experience. If your like me and are a fan of Horror (not guts and slashers for eye candy sake), true  Horror, and if you have a little back knowledge i.e. Demonology, Paranormal Investigation, seen The Exorcist or the Conjuring, then you will LOVE this game.\n\nThis is also the first review I have ever felt compelled to write on Steam, and I have been a member for years!

The only truely cliched part of the game is the story behind the haunting, but the majority of the scares are quite interesting, in my experience. I don't know why, but the game has received quite a lot of hate on the internet; much of which is from people who don't realize that the game is an alpha or people who want to look tough as though they're not scared. The majority of the horror of this game is from the terror of not knowing what will happen next, and when something does happen, it's often not what one expects. It's this type of horror that made games like the first 3 Silent Hill games so great. I reccomend it to anyone who can stomache the pre-release jitters and is a fan of horror.","December 9, 2013","true","3.0"," 36 of 41 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","36","41","0","0"

Now with those things being said, I'd like to add that this game is not complete, and it's latest update was a few months ago, I really hope they don't end up scrapping the game, it's suppost to have in total of 3 different areas to solve mysteries in, theres only one out right now. It has beautiful graphics, and a lot of jump scares and other parts that really are just creepy. The character model (i say that because Minor Spoiler: theres only one person you see) isnt that realistic, but it gets the point across and almost adds an old-fashioned scare (honostly I think the thing that scares me the most is the one character) and the graphic glitches in the game are expected (its still in beta.)

I won't say it's amazing, just that it holds potential. As you would guess if you've watched any Paranormal Activity film, you are a character who believes his house is haunted and films constantly to prove it. There are plenty of scares and tense moments that can happen at any random moment (for the most part, some are scripted depending on what you interact with). I won't go into detail about what scares there are but after say 5-6 playthroughs I still came across something new that got me. Graphics-wise it's not too bad, won't win any awards but for an alpha stage it holds up well. Story-wise nothing that particularly stands out as memorable but fits the tone appropriately regardless. If you like horror and feel in the mood for a good scare or two then I would recommend playing this. At such a price it may feel a little steep with the length of the game (~20 minutes a go I found), but I found it justifiable enough given the replay value and the fact that it was fresh in comparison to other horror games/mods. Also, if you like it, you can help make the game better by commenting on the forum as the developer is very active and is open to improvements, not to mention all future updates and DLC would be free.","December 26, 2013","true","1.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

I personally like the IDEA of the gameplay and the concept, but I wouldn't go so far as to say that I love the general gameplay as it stands right now either.  Hopefully that'll make more sense as you continue to read my review, but let's get down to it.\n\nIn terms of graphics, it actually looks pretty decent for an indie game.  I've seen some people saying that their computers couldn't handle it...but I've got a Nvidia Geforce 610 GT and I managed to run the game with just about everything on whilst also getting some pretty decent frames, so seeing as how this is a 'work in progress' I'm sure that subject to change...for the good or otherwise.\nWhen it comes to the camera effects and the SFX and whatnot, I'd say that's mostly where the game shines at in terms of graphics.  The distortions are done pretty well, there's some haze if you try to look at something in the distance, and the colors even begin to seperate when it rains (I.E. the water causes the camera to see Red, Green, and Blue).  Now, all this being said, there are some flaws here and there.  Some examples would be some textures looking...a bit outdated/out of place, randomly changing pictures (And not in the good way either...as in the paintings seem to be actually changing into something completely different before my eyes at times.  If that's part of the game, then just shoot me a message, but I'm pretty sure I saw one of those Michael Jackson paintings literally morph into one of the bathroom paintings.)\n\nThere are some things that I did kinda gripe about in the game that others might say was just me nitpicking, but personally they kinda stood out a lot.  For one thing the perspective of your character is...odd.  I feel like he's taller than the viewpoint may imply, as referenced by the furniture and whatnot, but whenever I attempted to interact with something I couldn't help but feel like I was incredibly short.  The rooms could have been a bit more interesting in my opinion, and the design of the house just felt...off.\n\nNow the sound is one of the high points.  Listening to the game via my computer speakers doesn't do it enough justice, so I normally use my headphones when I play this game.  It does a fair job of immersing you into the game via sound, and it does help to make the game more atmospheric/scary.\n\nWhen it comes to gameplay, the premise of the game is pretty basic.  You go around the house and record the strange occurances that happen there, or don't happen as the case may be.  You've got your flashlight, and you've also actually got a time limit on how long you can stay up before you have to charge your camera.  If you don't make it back to your bedroom before the battery hits zero then you die.  You can go around the house and collect/read the letters left behind by the previous owner, as well as learn the history of the house via the laptop, or you can learn about our main character's background.\n\nThe story is nothing special at all.  It's actually your typical 'Haunted House' type plot.  I understand that the game is supposed to be, more or less, of an homage to Paranormal Activity, but the story could really have been a bit less cliched in my opinion.  Not that you're required to even figure out the story, as you could just play the game without ever picking up a single note.\n\nThe scares aren't very scary.  I jumped due to...well, jump-scares, but that's it.  I never felt real-deal fear while I played the game, and some of the scares just felt a bit forced and really typical for me.  I get that they're dynamic to help make the game stay fresh, but that only works if the game continues to scare you...that never really happened for me.\n\nThis isn't going to affect my decision on how I'd rate this game, but if you came here with the expectation that the game would have fairly frequent updates...well, then you may want to look elsewhere.  As you could probably tell from the patch-notes about, the game hasn't been updated since April.  I don't currently know what the creator is doing as of right now, but I had heard that he has tried to fund the project through a website other than Kickstarter.  I currently don't know the name.\n\nPersonally, I don't know if I'd recommend this game as it stands.  I liked the idea/concept of this game, and I'd very much like to see how much farther it'll go during development, but as it stands it's just an alright game to me.  It offers nothing new in the way of gameplay, story, or otherwise, but at the same time the premise of the game is pretty appealing to those who like to try out new things.\n\n***EDIT*** 7/1/15\n\nSo I've checked this game every chance that I've gotten since the latest update on New Year's Eve, and...nothing.  No updates, no latest news, nothing.  As I've stated before, it's not a bad game and it shows promise...but what's the point of promise if it just doesn't deliver?\n\nSeriously, I've just about given up on the game at this point.  I could seriously care less about the game being converted to UE4.  Why not finish the UE3 version of the game first and work on the UE4 version second?  It'd certainly give us all something to do.","August 10, 2014","false","6.5"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","12","16","0","1"

The controls are hardly explained. The objective is unexplained. The fact that you die when your camera dies should probably also be mentioned. You just walk around the hosue clicking on random things until the game decides to throw a random event at you. Most of the time I wasn't even turned the right way to witness what was happening and missed it all together. The camera beeps at random moments, which I assume denotes something, but I can't be sure. Everything in this game is so horribly lo res and misshapen that you can hardly tell what you're supposed to be looking at. Except the phone. The phone looks fantastic. Glitches are all over the place. I blew up while walking up the stairs for some reason. Also, why is this guy surprised to be finding written notes on his counter and such?

Rest assured, there are no zombies or survival mechanics to speak of. No, think Paranormal Activity: The Video Game. There's a guy, his camera, and some ghosts that want to rip your spine out of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. What's not to love? Here's a quick rundown on what you'll be doing in Paranormal!\n\nYou play as an idiot with a camera, in their haunted house which is obviously haunted                                                                              You walk around\nYou realize the game's textures, models, and visuals could use some polish\nYou watch things go "Boogie Loogie Ooogie!"\nYou go to bed to recharge your camera's batteries, because of game mechanics\nYou couldn't give less of a ♥♥♥♥ about your well being as your assaulted by malevolent spirits                                                           You find out that some serious ♥♥♥♥ went down in your house.\n\nYou\nDon't\nCare about it\n\nSeriously, you're given various reasons to leave the ♥♥♥♥ing place, but you don't, because who would in a situation like this\nYou kill your fish, you sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Or maybe it just clipped through the floor. I don't really know\nCue jumpscar-BOOGIE LOOGIE OOOGIE!!!\nYou die. RIP: Idiot With a Camera.\nYou play the game again because the developers promised 'dynamic' scares. It's sort of...eh at the moment. I saw some different scares here and there, but for the most part, it's all the same scares in a different order. They get old after awhile too\n\nSo there you have it. The game's got a ways to go, and the price it's going for is a bit much, especially for what's on offer here. However, something about it sort of clicked with me. I found the scares creative and effective. The atmosphere was starting to get to me (until I finished the game in about 20 minutes). So yeah, I enjoyed Paranormal. Granted, it got boring after awhile, but if the dev keeps up the hard work, then this shows some serious potential.","September 2, 2015","true","2.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

I think that the glitchs in the game play that is the current version is frustrating at first I had issues logging in and had to improvis for a while. But the story  how it only tells parts each play through makes it very addicting to say the lest. As soon as I beat it I had to play it five more times to figure out the whole story and fin all the trophies.  On a side note Is the  basement door intentionally glitchable?  If you walk strait at the door it will block your path from the inside. But if your in the basement and walk backwards  you can walk freely among the house and create more chacnes for trophies and event to be generated in a sort  of force reset each time you walk into a new area. Also since you go into the basement and walk out you get unlimited battery life so instead of havign a feeling of urgency you can take your time and make the game engine work for you.  But  I thought maybe the door glitch and the unlimited time was a hint of a easter egg to show the next level or somethign hidden in a secret room? You had me walking backwards  on the entire map for a while seeing if it was a tip or something,  then i tried the rock and halo  glitching items.  But i didnt find  any hidden room (if you hide one. )  this si truely  the best game i played for far this year thank you for creating a very immersive game with all the right elements!","April 10, 2015","true","4.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

Perhaps it is just a case of me having been desensitised by years of playing survival horror games, but I find the scares on offer here to be rather dull – they are all just too clichéd and expected, with your usual “ghost appearing in the mirror for a second” and “water turning bloody” type fares.

A genuinly unnerving and terrifying game at times. Unlike any other horror game I have played thus far, offering something different to likes of Amnesia, F.E.A.R (not the third I hasten to add, the first one which was scary) and slender, the three games that really defined the horror genre for me.\nObviously the game is inspired by films such as Paranormal Activity, but do not let that concept put you off. The concept of handheld camera footage and paranormal events occuring around the building translates exceptionally well to a game.\nBeing an early access game, I am truly excited for what will come next for Paranormal.\nIf you want you heart to race and to be unnerved whilst having a few excellent impromptu jumo scares along the way, look no further. At £6.99, this game is an absolute steal.","September 23, 2013","true","2.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

My first impressions were that the game has some great visuals and sound quality is unmatched and having the unique quality of each playthrough being completely different matt definatly had a great idea when he set out to do this but altogether the game feels like a beta in some areas specifically how pressing certin buttons before you have control of youre carector can cause the game to freeze but those are minor and easily fixable as with any game that uses a randomizer you are faced with the issue of content becuase if you play any randomized game enough youre bound to see repeats and wile i can say matt definatly added a huge number of scenarios and events i have found a couple events reoccur a few times in the same order although this was rare the game holds a steady framerate and deffinatly likes to push youre buttons with controvecial topics once in a while but all in al my only complaint is that the game could use some more scenarios (he has announced that he plans to add hundreds more) but i have to say with how small of a map the game uses matt make ammazing use of it in horrific and facinating ways i enjoyed everyminute of that horrifying house and am quite impressed by the mind behind the game being so creative with the scenarios im very much looking forward to his next dlc for the game that will nearly triple the game content paranormal: the town\n\noverall i must give this game a generous 8.8 out of 10\nbut only because matt dementous is very good at coustomer service by constantly helping out people and replying very fast to any technical issues\n","September 23, 2013","true","44.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

I hate that you can't save your progress and that there aren't any real objectives really. I mean, you kind-of just walk around until your battery dies.

And since its randomized it can either build atmospheric pacing or take the Dead Space approach of just jumpscaring you from the word "go". So throughout the game you walk around your house with a camera looking for your own scares, thats one way to do it. Its the complete opposite of most horror games where you try to avoid the monstrocity with his jaw stapled to his knee caps. Just try to imagine Oulast boiled down to its core, run around with vomitty motion blur and get jumpscared a million times. The games set out over about 4 days, each of them having new  things to jump out going "argle bargle wargle". Its a nice expiremeant, but right now its got several crashing issues and bugs, once or twice i got stuck in the same spot so i just had to wait for my camera to run out. But it is frequently updated, and is likley going to be much better in the finished version, so i'd hold off a bit before buying it. But as it is in its current state, It's mainly objects moving around, strange noises, and seeing things ins the corner of your eye, so it could be quite a scary expirence to the average person, but for regular horror fans such as myself, it will probably not scare you too much.","March 29, 2014","true","6.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I know it's unfinished and only worked on by the one guy, but I at least expected it to run.\n\nI'm not trying to bash the creator or the game. I genuinely enjoy the idea of a procedural haunted house simulator. But in the current state it is a no go. Once the optimisation issues have been fixed I'll happily give a positive review.\n\nIn the current state, do not buy this game unless your computer is a state of the art monolith. My Vista microwave cannot cope with it, and with that upcoming UE4 engine port I fear I will never get to play it.\n\n","April 12, 2014","false","5.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/246300/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1597 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nParanormal is a first person, "found footage" style game where you play as artist Mattel Clarke. Mattel has been witnessing strange events in his house, and has come to believe it is haunted. In an attempt to capture his findings, he sets up video cameras all around his house and utilizes a handheld camera for capturing POV shots.\n\nNow, Paranormal was one of the first games that I ever bought on Steam. Back in 2012, the game looked promising and interesting, and I also had no concept of "Early Access" since I was new to PC gaming. Back then, the game had significantly less content than it does now... however, it has also been in Early Access for almost four years. There is only one guy working on the game, which is why the development process is taking an excruciatingly long time. On the flip side, after almost four years, you would expect a game of this caliber to be nearing completion; on the contrary, Paranormal is far from it.\n\nThe base chunk of Paranormal is still in its primitive, and rather ugly in comparison to the Unreal 4 additions, stage, and it's unclear whether or not this main content will be upgraded to Unreal 4. In the base game, you walk around and try to trigger paranormal events. Once your camera battery is nearly drained, you head back to bed and see the cameras set up around the house; you're able to flick through them in an attempt to catch more spooky activity. Once you wake again, usually something, or rather multiple things, in the house has changed. You rinse and repeat the process until you come to an ending. It took a solid year for anything more than one or two endings to be added, and initially Paranormal was only about 10-20 minutes long, per playthrough.\n\nNow, the newly added portion of the game is all done in Unreal 4. It has awesome visuals, great voice-overs, it's set prior to the events in the base game, and it supposedly some pretty cool paranormal events. Unfortunately, I couldn't get that far in my play of the new content for one reason; the head bobbing is so atrocious that I seriously felt like I was going to be ill. I'm not a person who gets motion sickness at all, but I seriously had to stop playing after about 10 minutes. If this is taken out, or at least made an optional feature, I feel that the experience for some people would be a lot better. Likewise, there is  still some optimization that needs to be looked at, as I did find my framerate fluctuating between 40-60 quite consistently.\n\nThe reason that I cannot recommend Paranormal at this time is, to be quite honest, I personally feel like we will never see the finished product. The developer has a lot of work to do by himself, and he has a busy life that draws him away from working on the game quite often. There's great potential to be had here, and I'm extremely hopeful that one day there will be a finished product. Until I see this game nearing release, with more of the content tied together, I can't give this one a thumbs up. If you don't mind investing in Early Access titles that are going to take a long, long time to come to fruition, go ahead and pick it up. Otherwise, just hold off for a while. I'll be updating this review at various intervals of the games lifespan.\n\nRating: 3.0/5.0 - Average, can take it or leave it.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","March 20","false","1.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","0"

Aside from the  menu, though, it actually ends up being pretty scary for what looks like could be a 1-person UDK school project. Atmosphere is fantastic, and there are some scenarios that are exciting without relying on gore (the mannequin in the attic has so far been my favorite, or using the ouji board for the first time). The security camera videos you see when you go to sleep are pretty generic scare tactics and could definitely be improved (a mannequin slowly crawling the stairs into your bedroom, for example, would be a great idea). Definitely has potential. I'd enjoy working on a project like this, there's plenty of room for an expanding story/sequel/scares","May 10, 2014","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You find diary pages throughout the game that tell you the backstory of why the house is haunted and there are deep, psycological scares in store.

A Game where you play as an artist who lives in a house Haunted by a paranormal entity and with your video camera you have to go around the house and capture as many paranormal things as you can. The jumpscares are little overdone at times but its still scary. Looking forward to updates.","December 27, 2013","true","9.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Despite the graphics, getting stuck randomly and the look of items and rooms the game was enjoyable. The story was good but due to getting stuck and jumpscares not always appearing or something stopping them the game was harder to complete.\n\nHowever, I have just completely playing the unreal version just now. Everything that gamers of the original game wanted is getting completely. Although updates are slower than other games, the updates are vast and add whole new details to the game. I appreciate that it now takes a little longer for the scares to start happening which I found enjoyable and likeable, to establish the setting and tension. Even with more scares, the game is really good.\nThings to work on are\n- The game rapidly drops in frame rate to 60fps down to 12 fps when I go near the fire or there is a lot of light even with light settings turned down\n- More scares (that’s coming)\n- When answering the phone, the camera battery would often die down very quickly meaning I would have to go to bed. The issue with this is that the audio continues playing and the protagonist continues talking in his sleep\n- The SD card capacity reaches full amount and then I don't know what to do with it\n- The subtitles at the introduction of the games start were too small and didn't notice them until mid-way through the whole speech.\n\nOther than that would 100% recommend while the game is cheaper and it is good to have an audience voice with a dev that cares.\n","May 27","true","3.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Different things happened in each of my three attempts (glitched the first one, failed the second), but this game isn't just jump scares. You literally sweep the house about five times each "day" and scary ♥♥♥♥ leads to more scary ♥♥♥♥ that honestly sent chills down my spine through the whole thing. I've played Slender, and it does not compare at all. SCP Containment Breach manages to keep me on edge. This game takes the cake for terrifying. I got it 50% off with a badge cupon, but would've willingly paid the whole $10 had I known it would be this good. 10/10 I totally recommend this to anyone that doesn't mind a good 15 minutes of goosebumps per playthrough, and I can't wait to see how this game develops. Excellent job Matthew C. Cohen on this intense and wonderful game, I sincerely cannot wait to see what this game turns in to.","May 31, 2014","true","2.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You could even let your character start sleepwalking and do some creepy stuff in front of the camera. like staring at the wall like a zombie and talk with creepy voice.\nfurther on i hope to see some smoother graphics and perhaps some more stuff in the diffrent rooms. makeing it more like a house where someone could realy live.\n\n","April 17, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","1"

The artist may have gotten more than he bargained for...\n\nWith that creepy tagline out of the way, let's talk turkey here. Paranormal is a game inspired by the likes of The Blair Witch Project, Paranormal Activity, and Cloverfield. What it does is provide you with a startling haunted house-type simulator that offers jump scares and slowly simmering fear with a basic, perhaps shallow storyline that can vary in your playlength.\n\nMy tips for best game play? Always play unabridged. You'll get more scares that way. I still haven't experienced every scare yet and as of now, I'm starting to become too paranoid to experience them all. Collecting all of the collectibles is also a near impossible feat and you will get a visit from the succubus if you are attempting it.\n\nPros:\n\n- Offers varied scares\n- Game length can be short or long depending on your choices in game\n- Replayability\n- Bare bones storyline leaving you to investigate for clues\n- Developer is rebuilding the game and is active in sharing what's next for Paranormal\n\nCons:\n- Not your prettiest game\n- Storyline could use a little more structure\n- House layout can be confusing\n- There is no save\n\nI don't scare easily and I'm not a fan of the "camera footage horror" film genres, but I did find the game enjoyable. If you're looking for combat or zombies, that's not here. You're at the mercy of the hauntings here and you're just recording it. There aren't any puzzles. You just walk around and watch the haunted house come to life. If you just want to be a little scared, this is probably the game for you.","December 2, 2014","true","2.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I've "died" several times on the first episode, and I'm not sure if I'm supposed to do something special...each night you sleep more and more happens, floating furniture, jump scares, doors slamming, random noises, etc...so by night 3 I'm just like "please...just please kill me so I can start over on the nice "peaceful" day one again..." There are certain rooms that I hate touching...just because of the scares, I still love to attempt to play games like this, though most of them I can't play through much before quitting. Either way, its a really interesting game, and hopefully I'll brave up and figure out what to do.

But I've already encountered some annoying problems.\nFirst, as I stated, the visuals. Paranormal shows that a good engine doesn't mean good graphics ; the house is a huge mess. The furniture feels like it's been placed randomly, every single room is huge but is empty. This emptiness allows the player to easily guess whats is going to happen ; the easiest example are the dummies.\nThey are randomly placed all over the main room, and  are going to gather around you at one time or another.\nStill about the dummies, they were supposed to fall when I went down the stairs. They didn't. I bumped into an invisible wall, had to wait for a while before the dummies fell and I could move again.\n\nAnother visual problem is the head bobbing. I like head bobbing is first person games, but in Paranormal, the head bobbing feels like it's also controlled by the animations. Sometimes, the head will look at a particular point. I thought at first I was supposed to look at it, but no, it's just that sometimes, the hero feels like bowing his head, and suddenly getting it back up.\n\nThe idea behind Paranormal is good. It makes me think of The House in Underhell, but with more potential. We need to know more about the house before it gets creepy, we need to really control what we are doing, and most important, we shouldn't know what is going to try to scare us.\n\nA lot of work is needed for this game to be good. Maybe later, it'll be interesting, but currently, it's a mess, in visuals, and gameplay.","March 13, 2014","false","1.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Now with those things being said, I'd like to add that this game is not complete, and it's latest update was a few months ago, I really hope they don't end up scrapping the game, it's suppost to have in total of 3 different areas to solve mysteries in, theres only one out right now. It has beautiful graphics, and a lot of jump scares and other parts that really are just creepy. The character model (i say that because Minor Spoiler: theres only one person you see) isnt that realistic, but it gets the point across and almost adds an old-fashioned scare (honostly I think the thing that scares me the most is the one character) and the graphic glitches in the game are expected (its still in beta.)

The controls are hardly explained. The objective is unexplained. The fact that you die when your camera dies should probably also be mentioned. You just walk around the hosue clicking on random things until the game decides to throw a random event at you. Most of the time I wasn't even turned the right way to witness what was happening and missed it all together. The camera beeps at random moments, which I assume denotes something, but I can't be sure. Everything in this game is so horribly lo res and misshapen that you can hardly tell what you're supposed to be looking at. Except the phone. The phone looks fantastic. Glitches are all over the place. I blew up while walking up the stairs for some reason. Also, why is this guy surprised to be finding written notes on his counter and such? It appears that he's been living there for a lttile bit. Is he just now realizing that there is type written notes scattered about his house in plain sight?","December 28, 2013","false","1.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It is also a good game to play with friends who are also willing to let themselves to be scared.  This is my second favourite horror party game next to the original slenderman games.

Rest assured, there are no zombies or survival mechanics to speak of. No, think Paranormal Activity: The Video Game. There's a guy, his camera, and some ghosts that want to rip your spine out of your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. What's not to love? Here's a quick rundown on what you'll be doing in Paranormal!\n\nYou play as an idiot with a camera, in their haunted house which is obviously haunted                                                                              You walk around\nYou realize the game's textures, models, and visuals could use some polish\nYou watch things go "Boogie Loogie Ooogie!"\nYou go to bed to recharge your camera's batteries, because of game mechanics\nYou couldn't give less of a ♥♥♥♥ about your well being as your assaulted by malevolent spirits                                                           You find out that some serious ♥♥♥♥ went down in your house.\n\nYou\nDon't\nCare about it\n\nSeriously, you're given various reasons to leave the ♥♥♥♥ing place, but you don't, because who would in a situation like this\nYou kill your fish, you sick ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Or maybe it just clipped through the floor. I don't really know\nCue jumpscar-BOOGIE LOOGIE OOOGIE!!!\nYou die. RIP: Idiot With a Camera.\nYou play the game again because the developers promised 'dynamic' scares. It's sort of...eh at the moment. I saw some different scares here and there, but for the most part, it's all the same scares in a different order. They get old after awhile too\n\nSo there you have it. The game's got a ways to go, and the price it's going for is a bit much, especially for what's on offer here. However, something about it sort of clicked with me. I found the scares creative and effective. The atmosphere was starting to get to me (until I finished the game in about 20 minutes). So yeah, I enjoyed Paranormal. Granted, it got boring after awhile, but if the dev keeps up the hard work, then this shows some serious potential.","September 2, 2015","true","2.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","0"

I think that the glitchs in the game play that is the current version is frustrating at first I had issues logging in and had to improvis for a while. But the story  how it only tells parts each play through makes it very addicting to say the lest. As soon as I beat it I had to play it five more times to figure out the whole story and fin all the trophies.  On a side note Is the  basement door intentionally glitchable?  If you walk strait at the door it will block your path from the inside. But if your in the basement and walk backwards  you can walk freely among the house and create more chacnes for trophies and event to be generated in a sort  of force reset each time you walk into a new area. Also since you go into the basement and walk out you get unlimited battery life so instead of havign a feeling of urgency you can take your time and make the game engine work for you.  But  I thought maybe the door glitch and the unlimited time was a hint of a easter egg to show the next level or somethign hidden in a secret room? You had me walking backwards  on the entire map for a while seeing if it was a tip or something,  then i tried the rock and halo  glitching items.  But i didnt find  any hidden room (if you hide one. )  this si truely  the best game i played for far this year thank you for creating a very immersive game with all the right elements!","April 10, 2015","true","4.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

It's scary on a lot of levels. It's scary because of the things you see. It's scary because of the things you don't see. It's also scary because of the things you hear. The story itself is kind of mysterious, and given to us via objects we find around us. It's not overly deep, but this is perfect! Good for replay as each play is different. Please keep in mind this game is an early access title, currently still in Alpha. Not everything is running, but the game does play rather well. There are glitches here and there as to be expected, so if getting to play a game in it's early stages is not your thing...you might wait for the finished version. If that kind of thing excites you, and you're a fan of horror games, do yourself a favor and pick this game up. I did happen to get my copy at a discount, but I think it's worth the ten dollars, and will certainly be worth it once the game is finished.","March 11, 2014","true","10.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It always keeps you on your feet. You happen to be a man named Marcus, trying to film strange happenings inside his house to have documented proof of the paranormal, however, he doesn't realize what is really in store for him. Only equipped with a camera and flashlight you traverse his house looking for clues and proof of the other side, when your camera starts to die you go to sleep and begin a new night and every new night has new hauntings in store for you. Every haunting is different from the next it is suggested you play in the dark with the volume turned up for the best experience.

It's up there with Outlast. Paranormal takes on the elements and features (sounds, effects, visuals) as the Paranormal movie trilogy. It's your Blair Witch Project type of set up - found footage, you know the type. The plot is simple, you document paranormal activity in a house and try avoid being killed by enviromental and accidental mistakes. For isntance: You have to sleep to recharge your camera's battery. If you run out of juice before you get to bed, you will probably end up dead. The game also uses sound efx to set a scary atmosphere. Footsteps, doors closing, items breaking, shouting, crying, etc. Plus we cant leave out the roaring sound when something "paranormal" is about to happen. As for replayability, each experience is different. Objects are located in different places, things happen in some play throughs and don't in others. Over all, if your looking for a good scary game like slenderman or outlast, this is a good game to add to your horror game collection.","April 29, 2014","true","1.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

My first impressions were that the game has some great visuals and sound quality is unmatched and having the unique quality of each playthrough being completely different matt definatly had a great idea when he set out to do this but altogether the game feels like a beta in some areas specifically how pressing certin buttons before you have control of youre carector can cause the game to freeze but those are minor and easily fixable as with any game that uses a randomizer you are faced with the issue of content becuase if you play any randomized game enough youre bound to see repeats and wile i can say matt definatly added a huge number of scenarios and events i have found a couple events reoccur a few times in the same order although this was rare the game holds a steady framerate and deffinatly likes to push youre buttons with controvecial topics once in a while but all in al my only complaint is that the game could use some more scenarios (he has announced that he plans to add hundreds more) but i have to say with how small of a map the game uses matt make ammazing use of it in horrific and facinating ways i enjoyed everyminute of that horrifying house and am quite impressed by the mind behind the game being so creative with the scenarios im very much looking forward to his next dlc for the game that will nearly triple the game content paranormal: the town\n\noverall i must give this game a generous 8.8 out of 10\nbut only because matt dementous is very good at coustomer service by constantly helping out people and replying very fast to any technical issues\n","September 23, 2013","true","44.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

You could even let your character start sleepwalking and do some creepy stuff in front of the camera. like staring at the wall like a zombie and talk with creepy voice.\nfurther on i hope to see some smoother graphics and perhaps some more stuff in the diffrent rooms. makeing it more like a house where someone could realy live.\n\n","April 17, 2014","true","1.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","1"

Other times it's not. Then a thing moves, but like it shouldn't, so I guess that's sort of weird. Then you can't hit escape to use the menu so that's really spooky.\n\nOccasionally the ghost/s commit a serious decorating faux pas and put chairs on tables, and you get a sick recording of it for youtube. Then they leave mean messages on your wall in blood, but I mean what the h*ck are they gonna do, put a jpeg on my bathroom mirror?\n\nMy god. There's a jpeg. On the bathroom mirror.

It's up there with Outlast. Paranormal takes on the elements and features (sounds, effects, visuals) as the Paranormal movie trilogy. It's your Blair Witch Project type of set up - found footage, you know the type. The plot is simple, you document paranormal activity in a house and try avoid being killed by enviromental and accidental mistakes. For isntance: You have to sleep to recharge your camera's battery. If you run out of juice before you get to bed, you will probably end up dead. The game also uses sound efx to set a scary atmosphere. Footsteps, doors closing, items breaking, shouting, crying, etc. Plus we cant leave out the roaring sound when something "paranormal" is about to happen. As for replayability, each experience is different. Objects are located in different places, things happen in some play throughs and don't in others. Over all, if your looking for a good scary game like slenderman or outlast, this is a good game to add to your horror game collection.","April 29, 2014","true","1.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There is no suspense or subtlety, only jump-scares. From the very first minutes of the very first day you can find levitating or moving objects, tryhard creepy posing-doll figures, and a whole bunch of hollow trope appearances. It really feels like the game is constantly rolling an RNG and randomly fires off a 'spooky' happening from a small list, and by the time your preset death occurs you will have likely seen the whole list. Some of the startle-scares try so hard that it actually becomes laughable, one of which is literally just a posing-doll ornament that just slides in under your view like a motion-tween HUD element, and then slides away again, without explanation or reaction from the character. Yeah. It's that kind of game.\n\nI would have ADORED a game of genuine paranormal exposure and investigation in an enclosed space, but this is not that game it claims to be. I'm pretty sure the only kind of person that would enjoy this game is the kind of person that thinks a 'screamer' is 'horror'. Worse yet that a kickstarter was put up for a second area (yes, a second zone, in the first game) before the first area was even finished, and OH LOOK, it's STILL in early access!\n\nSave your money. Watch a youtube lets play, and then you will have seen it all.\nDon't believe me? Watch a few lets plays and see exactly how many differences you can find.

I'm just one of those people that get headaches from film grain so no points loss there.\nThe music is nerve racking.\n\nNew Unreal version: The house is different, which is pretty cool, the batteries drain quicker which kind of sucks.\nThere is a "day" phase and a night phase and the hauntings a bit  different which is cool.\n\nThere is a bigger outside area to explroe compared to the orginal version with notable land marks to find while exploring.\nThe haunts seem to occur less frequently but it is an unfinished version and the dev is working to add more to it.\nVisually it is beautiful compared to orginal version which still looked pretty good.

But I've already encountered some annoying problems.\nFirst, as I stated, the visuals. Paranormal shows that a good engine doesn't mean good graphics ; the house is a huge mess. The furniture feels like it's been placed randomly, every single room is huge but is empty. This emptiness allows the player to easily guess whats is going to happen ; the easiest example are the dummies.\nThey are randomly placed all over the main room, and  are going to gather around you at one time or another.\nStill about the dummies, they were supposed to fall when I went down the stairs. They didn't. I bumped into an invisible wall, had to wait for a while before the dummies fell and I could move again.\n\nAnother visual problem is the head bobbing. I like head bobbing is first person games, but in Paranormal, the head bobbing feels like it's also controlled by the animations. Sometimes, the head will look at a particular point. I thought at first I was supposed to look at it, but no, it's just that sometimes, the hero feels like bowing his head, and suddenly getting it back up.\n\nThe idea behind Paranormal is good. It makes me think of The House in Underhell, but with more potential. We need to know more about the house before it gets creepy, we need to really control what we are doing, and most important, we shouldn't know what is going to try to scare us.\n\nA lot of work is needed for this game to be good. Maybe later, it'll be interesting, but currently, it's a mess, in visuals, and gameplay.","March 13, 2014","false","1.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The random generation in the game for hauntings is amazing, and is only going to get better. Don't knock it because it is still in early access, its got enough to entertain you, and will keep getting more and more to keep you entertained. The found-footage style this game gets from things like Paranormal Activity and Blair Witch Project is a unique take on gameplay, and something I've only seen paranormal do.","February 6, 2014","true","4.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It always keeps you on your feet. You happen to be a man named Marcus, trying to film strange happenings inside his house to have documented proof of the paranormal, however, he doesn't realize what is really in store for him. Only equipped with a camera and flashlight you traverse his house looking for clues and proof of the other side, when your camera starts to die you go to sleep and begin a new night and every new night has new hauntings in store for you. Every haunting is different from the next it is suggested you play in the dark with the volume turned up for the best experience.

It's scary on a lot of levels. It's scary because of the things you see. It's scary because of the things you don't see. It's also scary because of the things you hear. The story itself is kind of mysterious, and given to us via objects we find around us. It's not overly deep, but this is perfect! Good for replay as each play is different. Please keep in mind this game is an early access title, currently still in Alpha. Not everything is running, but the game does play rather well. There are glitches here and there as to be expected, so if getting to play a game in it's early stages is not your thing...you might wait for the finished version. If that kind of thing excites you, and you're a fan of horror games, do yourself a favor and pick this game up. I did happen to get my copy at a discount, but I think it's worth the ten dollars, and will certainly be worth it once the game is finished.","March 11, 2014","true","10.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Other times it's not. Then a thing moves, but like it shouldn't, so I guess that's sort of weird. Then you can't hit escape to use the menu so that's really spooky.\n\nOccasionally the ghost/s commit a serious decorating faux pas and put chairs on tables, and you get a sick recording of it for youtube. Then they leave mean messages on your wall in blood, but I mean what the h*ck are they gonna do, put a jpeg on my bathroom mirror?\n\nMy god. There's a jpeg. On the bathroom mirror. Those conniving ♥♥♥♥ing puppets probably did this. One of 'em probably taped it up there when I was being bullied by the world's shortest human fence. Gonna call up their ghost momma on the ouija board, see if we can't get this bullpoop sorted out. Oh no, the board told me to die. Well geeze I guess I see where these wooden hooligans get their manners from.\n\nIn summary, if you like the movie Paranormal Activity, then you have brain problems but I guess you'd also like this? Otherwise it's a real snoozefest. I mean maybe the other two scenarios involve more menace and originality than the base one, but I doubt it.\n\nAlso man is it easy to break.","October 8, 2015","false","1.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","38","3","8","5","0"

It's a fairly good indie game, and it's pretty challenging to figure out each puzzle. You always have X amount of time to figure certain things out. The scares are good, the soundtrack is some great dark ambient music that I wouldn't mind just having on a disk, and the letters you find are pretty interesting.\n\nThe graphics, even for an indie game using the Unreal engine, are a bit dated. I don't know how long this game has been in development, but the overall layout for the game is basically one map, if you remember the heyday of playing Unreal Tournament in the "Giant room" maps - it comes across a lot like that, though a bit less cartoony.\n\nThe use of wooden figures throughout the game is done pretty well, too - as someone who has used these to do different poses in order to gain a certain degree of perspective from different angles, I have thought more than once about the creepy factor that they represent. Their utility in this game is as a tool to make you creeped-out.\n\nThat seems to be the focus here, a skin-crawling feeling that is drawn out, less of a jump scare horror game. It plays out like you would expect a haunting to play out, if you believe in that sort of thing. This is one of those horror games that in order to become immersed, you really should turn out the lights and make things as dark as possible.\n\nThe game's pacing is also almost unbearably slow, but that's a common complaint for almost any game in this genre.\n\nIn short: Not bad. 6/10 - The price gets a point knocked off. I'm not saying it's a regretable purchase, I'm just saying it's a bit expensive for what it is. If you can obtain the game in a bundle, do so, you will be doing yourself a favor.","March 21, 2014","true","1.9"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

But then you start to notice you may not be alone in the studio, no one believes you, so you decide to try and collect 'evidence'.\n\nYou don't actually collect evidence, but the developer uses it as an excuse to make your point of view through a fuzzy, crappy, pixelated video recorder that no one should have any business owning in 2015.\n\nThe entire game involves you wandering around your studio, trying to find proof the house is haunted. As you spend more time in the studio, you'll find little tidbits of information that help you slowly understand the haunting and the story behind it.\n\nThe studio is crampt and small, making exploring the house a very short affair. What is supposed to attract you is all of the paranormal activity happening in the studio.\n\nThe game boasts re-play-ability by having 'randomly generated' events happen. The issue is, after the first or second play through, there isn't really anything random about it, the events that happen are so few and varied you may very well start seeing the same thing happen during the first play through.\n\nObviously, since this game is in Early Access, it's unpolished. But I wouldn't even use that word with this title. The last time I played it, the game had parts of game play elements that were scrapped, but never removed, the game had two title screens, one of which doesn't work or save any of your options properly.\n\nIf you want to believe what the author says on the game's forums here, you'd be lead to believe not only has he fixed several bugs, added in new content and added in a demo for the Unreal Engine 4 remake, but I didn't see any of that. Why? Because right after the title screen the game locks up every, single time.\n\nThis isn't an issue of my hardware, I got a great set-up that plays current gen titles just fine. The issue is with the developer, his programming and his progress with the title. At this point, I just consider this lost money. If the author reads this, I wouldn't mind you buying a game for me from my wish list to make up for the worthless garbage you sold me.","May 5, 2014","false","2.1"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","8"

If Basement is scrawled on the floor in blood, the damn door is locked.  Yes, I can't even get into the basement of my own house unless the random time is right for me to go down there.  This game is just a complete incoherent mess at this point.","June 23, 2014","false","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both versions remain unfinished.\n\nWhat is Paranormal?\nGenre: Indie, Horror, Early Access\nDeveloper: Matt C. Cohen (single entity)\nProducer: Matt C. Cohen (single entity)\nRelease Date: 19 Oct, 2012\nReview Author: ScottyNOW\n\n'Paranormal', not to be confused with the 'Paranormal Activity' movie series. Paranormal, the video game, implements the same concept of poltergeists that cause havoc across houses, a nightmare for 'nannies' and cleaners alike. The story revolves around an artist (protagonist) in his place of residence, he is determined to understand what is going on around him as things seem to go 'bump' in the night; attempting to gain closure and regain his sanity from the footage gathered.\n\nAudience and Verdict\n\nI believe youtubers and horror fanatics (i.e me and you) will receive the most enjoyability out of this, I also recommend for the best consumer experience is to switch off any external lights and use with headphones. The experience wasn't revolutionary and other games seem to do the same thing better, regardless of this, the game itself is a work-in-progress, and as such, a pricetag of $5/£3.47/€4.41 is comendable at best. I honestly don't believe in the 3+ years of development that any groundbreaking progress has happened and this game is more of a hobby that the game developer tinkers with in his spare time than an actual game that will gain constant updates and with that in mind, I do NOT recommend it.\n\nCATEGORY        SCORE/10        COMMENTS                Gameplay        6        Find scares, rinse and repeat.

There's many reasons:\n\n1. Repetition - example: Slender - Same thing over and over.\n2. Frustration - example: Amnesia - So much dying and 30 minute puzzles.\n3. No replay value - example: One Late Night - The same experience every time you play.\n\nAll these were great games, but for the reasons listed they lost appeal. In my opinion, a horror game should constantly suprise you with every playthrough, completely immerse you in the enviornment with intriguing sounds and visuals, have a good story and plot, and be simple in mechanics, hud, and objectives.\n\nParanormal did all those things and then some. It's barely in alpha and it's already my favorite horror game. I can't wait to see what the future holds for this game.\n\n10/10","January 26, 2014","true","3.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

There is no suspense or subtlety, only jump-scares. From the very first minutes of the very first day you can find levitating or moving objects, tryhard creepy posing-doll figures, and a whole bunch of hollow trope appearances. It really feels like the game is constantly rolling an RNG and randomly fires off a 'spooky' happening from a small list, and by the time your preset death occurs you will have likely seen the whole list. Some of the startle-scares try so hard that it actually becomes laughable, one of which is literally just a posing-doll ornament that just slides in under your view like a motion-tween HUD element, and then slides away again, without explanation or reaction from the character. Yeah. It's that kind of game.\n\nI would have ADORED a game of genuine paranormal exposure and investigation in an enclosed space, but this is not that game it claims to be. I'm pretty sure the only kind of person that would enjoy this game is the kind of person that thinks a 'screamer' is 'horror'. Worse yet that a kickstarter was put up for a second area (yes, a second zone, in the first game) before the first area was even finished, and OH LOOK, it's STILL in early access!\n\nSave your money. Watch a youtube lets play, and then you will have seen it all.\nDon't believe me? Watch a few lets plays and see exactly how many differences you can find. You'll be able to count them on one hand.","March 18, 2015","false","2.0"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It's a fairly good indie game, and it's pretty challenging to figure out each puzzle. You always have X amount of time to figure certain things out. The scares are good, the soundtrack is some great dark ambient music that I wouldn't mind just having on a disk, and the letters you find are pretty interesting.\n\nThe graphics, even for an indie game using the Unreal engine, are a bit dated. I don't know how long this game has been in development, but the overall layout for the game is basically one map, if you remember the heyday of playing Unreal Tournament in the "Giant room" maps - it comes across a lot like that, though a bit less cartoony.\n\nThe use of wooden figures throughout the game is done pretty well, too - as someone who has used these to do different poses in order to gain a certain degree of perspective from different angles, I have thought more than once about the creepy factor that they represent. Their utility in this game is as a tool to make you creeped-out.\n\nThat seems to be the focus here, a skin-crawling feeling that is drawn out, less of a jump scare horror game. It plays out like you would expect a haunting to play out, if you believe in that sort of thing. This is one of those horror games that in order to become immersed, you really should turn out the lights and make things as dark as possible.\n\nThe game's pacing is also almost unbearably slow, but that's a common complaint for almost any game in this genre.\n\nIn short: Not bad. 6/10 - The price gets a point knocked off. I'm not saying it's a regretable purchase, I'm just saying it's a bit expensive for what it is. If you can obtain the game in a bundle, do so, you will be doing yourself a favor.","March 21, 2014","true","1.9"," 2 of 9 people (22%) found this review helpful","22","2","9","0","0"

But then you start to notice you may not be alone in the studio, no one believes you, so you decide to try and collect 'evidence'.\n\nYou don't actually collect evidence, but the developer uses it as an excuse to make your point of view through a fuzzy, crappy, pixelated video recorder that no one should have any business owning in 2015.\n\nThe entire game involves you wandering around your studio, trying to find proof the house is haunted. As you spend more time in the studio, you'll find little tidbits of information that help you slowly understand the haunting and the story behind it.\n\nThe studio is crampt and small, making exploring the house a very short affair. What is supposed to attract you is all of the paranormal activity happening in the studio.\n\nThe game boasts re-play-ability by having 'randomly generated' events happen. The issue is, after the first or second play through, there isn't really anything random about it, the events that happen are so few and varied you may very well start seeing the same thing happen during the first play through.\n\nObviously, since this game is in Early Access, it's unpolished. But I wouldn't even use that word with this title. The last time I played it, the game had parts of game play elements that were scrapped, but never removed, the game had two title screens, one of which doesn't work or save any of your options properly.\n\nIf you want to believe what the author says on the game's forums here, you'd be lead to believe not only has he fixed several bugs, added in new content and added in a demo for the Unreal Engine 4 remake, but I didn't see any of that. Why? Because right after the title screen the game locks up every, single time.\n\nThis isn't an issue of my hardware, I got a great set-up that plays current gen titles just fine. The issue is with the developer, his programming and his progress with the title. At this point, I just consider this lost money. If the author reads this, I wouldn't mind you buying a game for me from my wish list to make up for the worthless garbage you sold me.","May 5, 2014","false","2.1"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","8"

HAHA Not even close!  Good Graphics?  Umm no! I think all the thumbs up are by the creators.\n-The graphics are horrid on a top of the line machine with everything up as far as it goes\n-While walking it randomly does some kind of motion to simulate something (no clue what) and makes me want to throw up.  Not fun.\n-You are eye level with the kitchen counter and dining room tables like you are 5 years old\n-its not even a little creepy in the 14 minutes I played before stopping to keep from throwing up due to motion sickness from the random camera bobbles\n-14 minutes in and I am fairly sure I will just uninstall this and figure I wasted $10\n-no the fact that it is pre release does not give me any need to check it out again later\n\nI really liked Slender the Arrival, the first Amnesia, and Day Light.

I really looked forward to playing this game for a long time except that the game is slow and takes long to load. Also my last commplaint is that once it finally loads, the game menu looks very very sloppy, what i mean is like the letters in the menu look terrible and the mouse is also slow. so, i dont really care about the sloppy menu, but i care that the game takes a long time to load and is very slow once it loads, so it was a real dissapointment and i feel like i wasted $10 and i feel ripped off. I also understand that this game is still an early access game so that it has a lot of updates ahead, so i just wanted to say that in the next couple of updates that you will update it to make it faster and make it load faster. So I dont recommend this game... for now.","August 19, 2014","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Both versions remain unfinished.\n\nWhat is Paranormal?\nGenre: Indie, Horror, Early Access\nDeveloper: Matt C. Cohen (single entity)\nProducer: Matt C. Cohen (single entity)\nRelease Date: 19 Oct, 2012\nReview Author: ScottyNOW\n\n'Paranormal', not to be confused with the 'Paranormal Activity' movie series. Paranormal, the video game, implements the same concept of poltergeists that cause havoc across houses, a nightmare for 'nannies' and cleaners alike. The story revolves around an artist (protagonist) in his place of residence, he is determined to understand what is going on around him as things seem to go 'bump' in the night; attempting to gain closure and regain his sanity from the footage gathered.\n\nAudience and Verdict\n\nI believe youtubers and horror fanatics (i.e me and you) will receive the most enjoyability out of this, I also recommend for the best consumer experience is to switch off any external lights and use with headphones. The experience wasn't revolutionary and other games seem to do the same thing better, regardless of this, the game itself is a work-in-progress, and as such, a pricetag of $5/£3.47/€4.41 is comendable at best. I honestly don't believe in the 3+ years of development that any groundbreaking progress has happened and this game is more of a hobby that the game developer tinkers with in his spare time than an actual game that will gain constant updates and with that in mind, I do NOT recommend it.\n\nCATEGORY        SCORE/10        COMMENTS                Gameplay        6        Find scares, rinse and repeat.
