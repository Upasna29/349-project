Anyone with any knowledge of the VXAce toolset could tell you right off that this game has had the LEAST amount of effort possible put into it. Complete with invisible walls (pathing errors) which no one seems to have even mentioned in a single review. While it's not a terrible game, it sure as hell isn't close to good, and is outright insulting to the RPGMaker community to suggest it deserves its current review score OR its MSRP of $10. As a matter of fact, if I it wasn't for the reasonable sale I bought it in, I would have already gotten  one of those new easy to request refunds.\n\nThis is an exploitation game (resembling the exploitation films of the 70's) by Aldorlea, Developed & Published. And little more.\n\n...\n\nReview Points...\n\n\nPro:\n+ The story is not terrible.\nI have read worse in RPGMaker games. Much worse. However, not being terrible is about as good as it gets. Take that for what it's worth. (very little)\n\n+ Custom Battle Backs.\nIt's possible I didn't notice, but it appears that all the battle backs are non-stock.\n\n+ Custom Music.\nI didn't notice any stock-music. This might be important to people. Though what music there is, isn't great and feels more like variety for the sake of variety rather than any intended theme. Again, bare minimum... VERY BARE.\n\n\nCon:\n- Interior transition points rarely match up, in either size or location.\nThis can leave you momentarily disjointed from the scene. It screams laziness, or worse, that they used prefab maps (from other projects) and simply shifted assets and linked them together. But I it's just an impression.\n\n- Minimal Custom Scripts.\nEverything I noticed, other than the mouse controls, was Yanfly Engine. It also lacks any journal entry, victory screen, or commonly used community patches to avoid some of Yanfly's WELL KNOWN bugs. As I already pointed out, BARE minimum. No effort. Little planning... It's likely all the scripts used where cut and paste only.\n\n- Invisible Walls.\nPathing issues crop up almost immediately in the first outdoor areas in the game...\n\n- Party Banter is mostly Vapid and often Vacuous.\nAt first, it could be cute. But not for long... And the few moments where something important is being said, are hard to notice amongst the constant dribble of pointless and utterly forgettable remarks. It's almost as if the main plot was written start to finish, and THEN 'filler' banter was inserted periodically along the route to break the monotony of grinding... No coherence. Little substance. And only the rarest glimmer of character development.\n\n- Generic Abilities.\nQuite literally, I played the first hour of the game spamming 'Attack' 90% of the time... And I was playing on HARD difficulty... Abilities are largely pointless until you get your healer. Not to mention, whoever named them, needs to be chided. Who, WHO names an ability 'Fortify' that does nothing but Buff ATK? And WHY does Guard, heal 15HP every time? Especially when half the loot items dropped from monsters are healing items usable IN BATTLE... /sigh (Must remain constructive)\n\n- Cluttered Maps.\nThe mapping isn't terrible... Like the story, THAT is as good as it gets. Period. And I might  have left it as a Pro, or not even mentioned it at all, had THE SAME TILES not been repeated ad-nauseum and placed as if the mapper was a blind folded Parkinson's patient.\n\n- Absolutely NO Economy of Battle Action.\nI really don't want to go into why this is important... But simply put, I felt almost NO urgency NOR importance in choosing one action over another in battle. EVER. Other than the occasional heal, almost every single battle could have been resolved using Auto. A few boss battles, required a few debuffs, and a few cures... But little more. It all felt entirely uninspired.\n\n\n\n\n","June 12, 2015","false","1.7"," 131 of 161 people (81%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","81","131","161","6","32"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/recommended/332390/","orgelambart","Orge Lambart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/orgelambart/","5484 products in account","I've absolutely fallen in love with Aldorlea developed games, they scratch that itch for turn based JRPG's I've had since the playstation 2 stopped being supported.  For the longest time I'd been waiting for a new game or games to fill the void, the few offerings I found with Xbox 360 and PS3 were ok, but too few and far between to really keep me occupied, and satisfy my needs.  When I made the leap from console gaming to PC gaming I noticed a decided lack of good rpg's.  In recent years that void has been filled, thanks to developers like Aldorlea.  The games have a nice quaint throwback feel to them, a nice mixture of humor while keeping the games moving along on a series path towards the ultimate finish.  Along the way you'll find classic RPG staples, like hidden areas (although some are overly hidden or just randomly placed, would have been nice if some on screen indicator appeared to show off hidden entrances) the old health potion in a barrel trick (much like the hidden areas I'd have liked if some on screen indicator appeared to show where hidden items were located, just to help those who must have everything like myself).  Fun side quest which are beneficial to helping make Undefeated feel like more than just another empty shill of an RPG maker game.\n\n\nThe Story\n\nThe game starts off with you having control of Marcus, you eventually and rather quickly pick up two additional party members in Bastien and Fela, these three will form the foundation of your party for the remainder of the game...  (or will they?)  You can then go on a casual stroll through the town, check out the sites, talk to various NPC's, pick up bits and pieces of information about the world and what's been going on in it, or maybe even grab a side quest or two.   (Don't forget to check all those barrels, never know what you might find)  After you've had your fill, you can retreat back to the barracks for rest.\n\nThe game switches view to Jeneva, who is in conversation with the big bosses of the current barracks, apparently she's meant to go on a very important and secret mission to discover what's been going on in a rather distant town, as contact has been lacking.  Jeneva is tasked with taking three conscripts through the mountain pass, and then ditching them!!! The mission is too important to have lowly conscripts getting in the way.  Jeneva eventually agrees and I'm sure you guessed which three conscripts she's going to pick for her wondrous mission..\n\nOne thing leads to another and Jeneva is wounded while trying to ditch the conscripts, so after some soul searching she decides to alter the plan and have the party escort her the remainder of the way.  This turn of events kick starts a magical adventure, filled with laughs, filled with tears, and gosh darn it filled with money... Money hidden in trees, and on dead bodies, and given to you by rich farmers and merchants and enemies OH MY!!!..\n\nThe Gameplay\n\nNot much can be said about gameplay, if you've played one turn based rpg you've played them all.  You pick your attack,  (Basic, skill based or magical) choose which enemy you want to attack and sit back.  Turn based combat is slightly boring, this game is no exception, you can typically select the auto attack button and sit back while your party auto attacks everything to death.  Although in order to use this method you'll be required to keep an eye on your parties health between battles and top if off when necessary.  Also keeping your gear and weapons up to date and not allowing yourself to be under-leveled is also something to keep in mind.  You'll be met with tutorial books which give a basic rundown of information on your upcoming area when things change, such as new party members join who have different types of attacks you may not be used too, or when entering a new area that has some other type of trap or pitfall.\n\nPro's\n\nGood story,\nInteresting characters,\nController/achievement/trading card support +++\nincreasing challenge as the game progresses\n\nCon's\n\nfew technical issues which aren't the developers fault, but a fault of the engine.\nI want my side quest in order dang it lol... it's kind of off putting seeing the numbers out of order... grrr\n\nRecommendation\n\nI'd love to see some type of on screen indicator of hidden areas, items and side quest.  Another minor issue was the side quest numbers being out of order, and no real way of knowing what mission you're currently on, outside of backtracking and talking to NCP's, hoping one of them will remind you of your current mission.  Those things aside I'd fully recommend and endorse this game to any and every turn based RPG fan out there.  Keep in mind if you aren't a fan of turn-based combat or rpg maker games in general you might want to avoid this one.  Although this game has enough meat and potatoes at a decent enough price to give you 10 - 20 hours of fun, retro 16 bit rpg action.","April 3","true","10.3"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","17","18","0","1"

While it is not perfect, it is still a decent game and worth checking out. For more detail, read below.\n\nFor a detailed review, I'm going to use the classic GIMLET system, as used by the RPG Addict. Rating: 0: Awful, 1- 2 Bad, 3 - 4: Poor, 5 - 6: Average, 7 - 8: Above Average, 9 - 10: Great!\n\n1. Game World: The game world is well explained, and you got the sense that you *are* in the army, out to defeat evil. Nicely done. The world feels alive too, and I got a kick out of that dog and all the comments about it by the end of the game: 10/10\n\n2. Character development (leveling): Characters develop at the standard pace as an RPGMaker game. 5/10\n\n3. NPC Interaction: Decent interaction. NPC's change dialogue over the course of the game. Minimal interaction with your party members though, but you do learn the essentials about them at least throughout the game. I just found myself wishing for a little more interaction by the end of the game, as I still felt like some of my party members were an Engima to me. 7/10\n\n4. Encounters and Foes: Decent balance. I felt the late game boss waves were a tad inbalanced, and I dread to think how someone who didn't find a few secret rooms would have ever survived that, especially in the absence of a heal all spell. Probably needs light tweaking here and there, but overall, decent balance of foes until the very end game: 5/10\n\n5. Magic and Combat. Decent. If you hate random fights you can always choose to select visible encounters, though expect 1 - 2 enemies to always block your path per map. Still, you can at least plan on 1 - 2 battles this way, just don't expect to be able to dodge them if you go back for a side quest and are massively overleveled. 6/10\n\n6. Equipment. Equipment is doled out as the game progresses, though occasionally you can buy something when in town. Just except it to get replaced by the next equipment hand out though. However, if you want to buy your way to power, this game does not alow that, be forewarned. 6/10\n\n7. Economy: You always have a need for gold in this game, as accessories are so expensive. Only thing I didn't like is KO recovery items were so expensive compared to the amount of gold earned per fight, but you can get around that by resting for a really cheap rate and still recovering from KO. 7/10\n\n8. Quest: Many side quests. I just wish they had used something besides a document telling you what the quest is to remind you of it. I often forgot the clues to solving the side quest after a while, and had to proceed blindly. Resulted in the only ones I completed were by sheer dumb luck in the end. 6/10\n\n9. Graphics, sound, interface. Standard RPGMaker interface, with a few scripts to modify it. Graphics are decent, sound good. No UI bugs stood out. Just don't go in expecting state of the art graphics. 6/10\n\n10. Gameplay: Overall, good. Farily linear game, with some side quests you can explore and find and solve. Not too many optional areas though, except for a room here or room here, but that's not a negative in my opinion. Only improvement I'd like to see is a little better balancing late game, and maybe another side area or two for the player to earn gold that wishes to do that. 7/10\n\nTotal: (0 - 20 Bad, 20 - 40 Poor, 40 - 60 Average, 60 - 80 Above Average, 80+ Game of the year?) 65/100, which is nicely above the recommended cutoff of 50 with the way I score each item. Overall I'd say this is a decent, above average game. Probably won't win game of the year, but you will have fun while playing it, which is what matters.","July 28, 2015","true","6.8"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

No looking around for hours figuring out what to do.. Combat works well, characters either have a mana or action points pool (mana needs potions, action points restore during battle). With a wide variation of spells and a lot of effects like paralyze, blind, poision etc.\n\nGame starts of a little slow, with monsters being fast and easy. This can be a little boring at the start, but the dialogue kept me entertained. Later on in the game though, this will get more tactics. Especially with boss battle's.\n\nArt is also very well done, lots of different and original looking monsters and npcs. I found a review saying the amount of game time would be around 20 hours, I can't confirm this, but it definitely aint a short game that you finish in a couple of hours.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6TOgSiccYI","April 4, 2015","true","3.1"," 34 of 49 people (69%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","69","34","49","2","1"

January, 2014\n\nLet’s dive right into the Review!\n\nStoryYou slip, for the main part, into the role of Marcus and his newly found friends, Bastion and Fela. Each character has it’s own personality and quirks that’ll make you groan more than once during the game. Bastion would rather use his Axe, that has been forced onto him, to chop onions then to slay evil with it. They are three new conscripts charged to protect their Kingdom, while they are not happy there’s nothing they can do about it. At first they really dislike their new lives as conscripts but as the story unfolds they learn that they are actually doing something very important.\n\nThose three aren’t the only playable characters you’ll encounter some more as you progress with the story.\n\nIn the beginning you’ve been tasked to find a Trinket that has been hidden deep inside the forest.\nSo your first mission is to go and find it and then report back to your Captain. Sounds easy doesn’t it? Well once you fought your way through the jungle and after you’ve encountered and slain some creature you finally find the Trinket. At the same time a mutant Wolf charges at you and the battle starts.\n\nAfter returning to your Captain and telling him what exactly happened your real Story starts.\nThe three are now tasked to find out why the Wasteland is spreading and stop it, if possible.\n\nThis is as much as I’m going to spoil the story. Else it wouldn’t be fun right?\n\nGameplayAnyway. Undefeated is a JRPG through and through.\nThe game features several difficulty grades from easy to hard and even gives you the option whether you want to have invisible or visible enemies, giving you the chance to avoid random encounters. Battle is turn-based as you’re used to from other games of the genre. Meaning you can use special techniques, magic and attacks to defeat everyone who dares to stand in your way. As usual for this genre you move on a world map while visiting towns and sub dungeons and forests. A nice little addition tho that is that once you’ve been to a place you have the option to enter it or to walk through it which is a blessing once you start to look for all those Quests and Secret Rooms Besides that you can complete several Quests and find secret Rooms. Those are actually really important on a higher difficulty since the game even tells you that the best gear can only be found in those secret Room and good gear is exactly what you need if you reach the Wastelands on a higher difficulty.\n\nSome thoughtsI said I won’t spoil anything of the Story anymore but I’m afraid I have to since when you’re tasked to actually go forth to the Wastelands you’ll notice that your health sinks rapidly. The Developers have built in a nice little feature at that part in my opinion. You’re given Wasteland Rings which will prevent the rapid health loss while you enjoy the view of the Wastelands.\nI really liked that they built in such a feature since you have to give up your Accessory spot for those rings.\n\nWhat amused me the most while playing the game was that every now and then when you find a secret room, treasure, or even some new gear the characters are talking about your new discovery. Whether they explain why you can find gold in a tree logs or that Bastion demands those Speedy Boots since he is the slowest in the Party … Things like that give Undefeated a rather unique charm.\n\nOverall Undefeated is a really solid JRPG and well worth your time.\nThe game has some interesting characters which you certainly grow fond of rather fast.","May 23, 2015","true","8.9"," 34 of 50 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","34","50","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/recommended/332390/","TeeJaxOff","TeeJax <3","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeeJaxOff/","3936 products in account","Undefeated is an RPG maker game with a great story, well written dialogue and some very enjoyable gameplay.\n\nI'm not usually a fan of RPG maker games, as though I believe everyone has a story to tell, I honestly feel some of those stories are not worth listening to. Undefeated isn't one of those stories.\nYou start as a solider at the lowest ranks and quickly recruit some others to join you on your adventure. As with most RPG makers exploration is the key to starting out and there are plenty of NPCs, starter quests and shops to keep you interested before your adventure actually starts. There are many items to find (if you look in the right places) and lots of (witty) dialogue for those of you who prefer NPCs that don't all say the same thing.\nYou can find tutorial books dotted around the world with explanations for things from your inventory to combat so it's very accessible to those who have never played an RPG maker before which is appreciated. I've found many games from this genre assume that you've played something like this which is not always the case.\n\nUndefeated has good progression. You are able to level up yourself and other party members, learn abilities and equip certain items. You can purchase items to use in combat from various merchants you'll find through the game. You can also sell all your unused gear as that is the main way to gain money (monsters don't just walk around with pouches of gold now do they?). Combat is the usual JRPG style combat (Attack, defend, escape ect. with various sub-menus) which is simplistic but gets the job done. Though I didn't really enjoy the combat to much, that wasn't the reason I was playing so it didn't bother me to much.\n\nYour party members are likeable and I found myself rather enjoying engaging with them in dialogue. This keeps the game from being bland and boring and is a strong selling point. I feel there should be some connection with your team in a game and I definitely feel it in Undefeated. There is fantastic writing that is both serious and funny at times without feeling awkward or out of place.\n\nUndefeated is not without it's cons though. There is a rather large known game breaking bug. I am unsure if the developer is working on it but it has caused many people problems. I also feel that the game could have more customization or crafting options. It does feel a little limited as you start to progress in the game as there is not the largest pool of items (at least not that I've found). Thirdly I did not enjoy playing with a controller at all. For some reason everything felt inaccurate even whilst doing the most basic of things like walking; I resigned to using my keyboard and mouse in the end. Lastly, questing can become very confusing. You get some quests before you can actually do them and can end up spending a lot of time searching for the right location before realising you can't reach it yet.\n\nThe music in nice and fits the mood of the game well, though it can get a bit repetitive depending on how long you play for. I would have liked to see some default tilesets also; I did recognize a few from the basic pack (please correct me if I'm wrong). I understand tilesets take a very long time to make but it is one of the few things that can separate RPG maker games from each other.\n\nOverall Undefeated is a good game with a great story and some worthwhile dialogue to keep you entertained. It is definitely a game you should not miss when on sale if you like RPG maker games. There are great NPCs and party members to keep you entertained from start to finish.","April 18","true","7.4"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","1"

While MP fill up when you rest, TP can only be built up in fights, by attacking or by being damaged. They build up pretty quickly though, so you can make good use of them.\nAs usual in Aldorlea games there's a nice variety of spells and skills and it's fun trying everything out.\n\nI really like the story. A bunch of conscripts - young people that aren't happy at all about their military duty - get involved into something big. Of course they develop very well and find their inner strength, no surprise here, but their development always seems genuine and comprehensible. You get to know the characters quite well; their different origins, their opinions and plans for the future, and it's nice to watch them grow together and determinedly pursue the same goal.\nThere are bonus characters too that you might or might not find, and one of them is just hilarious.\n\nGame-wise I liked the fact that there are rather small maps. Exploring huge dungeons can be fun, but it's also nice not to get lost easily. However, the downside of this is a pretty high encounter rate. A bit too high for my taste. When exploring, it sometimes can get annoying and disturbing, especially since all fights take several rounds.\nThe game is well balanced though. When you find good strategies in every dungeon, you'll always have enough health and magic points to get through well. You don't have to get out of a dungeon to rest, just because you're running out of HP, MP or restorative items. You also find enough items so you actually don't have to buy a lot.\nWhat also helps very much to keep your characters healthy is that they regain some HP when defending. I made use of this feature a lot in fights.\n\nThere are a lot of secret rooms scattered all over the places. I'm personally not the biggest fan of secret rooms, but they are not too hard to find if you explore thoroughly. There's a lot of good items to be found in there, including the best equipment. If you find it you never have to buy anything at shops. However, I did miss getting some special equipment in shops. Comparing weapons and gear and deciding what to buy is something I enjoy, so that would have been nice in addition to the stuff that you can find.\n\nI can't say much about the music because I usually turn it off.\n\nTo sum it up: There's a bit too much fighting for my taste (and this is really just a matter of taste, for others it might even be a plus). But other than that I enjoyed the game very much and certainly recommend it.","April 10, 2015","true","24.0"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","72","23","32","0","1"

The storyline was pretty solid, it was a lot of fun to rank up in the military more and more as you go and get new armor sets from the quartermaster. The characters have individual personalities and the dialogue is believable which I believe is crucial for this type of game. The artwork was also pretty cool, all of the enemy battle portraits looked great. Difficulty is always an important factor in these games for me as I am a veteran jrpg player with an overly high opinion of my skills, so having the option to ramp it up is always a win for me.\n\nIf there was anything to complain about in this game I would say it just needs some touchups here and there, like some tiles could be walked through that weren't meant to be walked through, and vice versa. Far from game breaking though, I got no real advantage or disadvantage from those situations. Also *mild spoiler* I wish the "big bad" had a more active role throughout the game.\n\nOverall I would give this game an 8/10 and would definitely say it is worth buying, especially since on steam its $8.50 right now.\n\nAs for the creator's request for feedback and question of whether a sequel should be made I would definitely say yes. A followup game to see what happens to marcus and co definitely appeals to me, and I think a second touched up product could easily be a 9/10.\n\nThanks for the fun time, Undefeated :)","April 8, 2015","true","20.9"," 18 of 27 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","18","27","0","0"

Join with other members of your party to begin a long search to unravel this mystery, traveling through all sorts of landscapes and towns, meeting all sorts of people, and dealing with a host of monsters.\n\n\nAs with all the offerings from Aldorlea, the story is fantastic. Even though it is straightforward, there are a host of side quests to keep up with (over 15), and secret rooms to discover (25). However, it never gets confusing, and there are no loose ends, and you always know exactly what it is you are supposed to do next. However much time you want to spend on the various side quests, and how carefully you want to explore the surroundings for secrets is up to you. I personally take it very slow in Aldorlea's games because there are so many surprises to discover.\n\n\nThe artwork is beautiful and very detailed. The monsters are originally drawn, and the battle scenes feature nice detail and color.\n\n\nThe mechanics are simple and easy to understand, yet at the same time offer a great number of choices as to how to fight your battles.\n\n\nMusic is always pleasing in the Aldorlea games, and this one is no exception.\n\n\nIn any rpg, one of the most important aspects is the telling of the story ---- does it make sense at all times? is there good humor? does it keep your interest? does it captivate you early on? are the NPCs interesting and worth talking to? To all of these questions, the answer is a resounding "yes".\n\n\nLength is sometimes a question, and I can tell you that I am 5 plus hours in, and I can see that I am just getting settled in ---- so much to do and discover I can see that I'm in for a long play.

After playing this game I felt a wave of nostalgia. More and more recent entries in the genre tend to steer further away from classic rpg tropes in hopes of creating a different experience. Undefeated not only hosts these classic elements but embraces them. Hidden areas and checking your surroundings are explained early on to reap rewards for those who take the time to look, encouraging exploration. Side quests are requisitioned and stored in a separate log rather than being given vague details and relying on memory to complete. There are several difficulty and game play settings available to change the way you play. Want to have random battles? It's there. Rather have enemies on the screen instead? You can do that to.\n\nThe battle system is what you would expect from a jrpg and sticks closely to what most people are familiar with. It can tend to drone on in the earlier encounters regardless of what difficulty you start off with. However, further into the game is where they start to pick up in difficulty and more thought to your actions will be needed.\n\nThe story of the game is straightforward if not slightly vague in the beginning. My actions are dictated more towards following orders rather than a looming enemy or grand goal. You know, heroes quest. This changes as you progress further. Seemingly arbitrary plot devices start to make more sense. There is more to what is happening in the games world than it lets on to in the beginning.\n\nLastly, the way the game handles character development is through small chit chat and comments that you and your team members have throughout your adventure. These small interactions do big things in tying your actions with that of the characters and helps to build their individual personalities. Through this you can see the differences from character to character and you become more attached to them. There are even instances where they may say what you're thinking. "Why would someone hide money in a tree trunk?" "Well, who would look to steal money from a tree?" Whoa, you have a good point there game.\n\nIf you're looking to scratch that old school jrpg itch give this game a try instead of replaying that snes rpg for the 8th time.","June 7, 2015","true","21.9"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/332390/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","Undefeated is a RPG with party based combat. You control three conscripts, Marcus, Bastien and Fela that quickly become acquainted with each other after meeting for the first time. They will follow you around and they are the starting members of your party, along the way you’ll be able to acquire more companions, each with different abilities and skills.\n\nRight from the start, you’re not given much background on what has happened prior to our little heroes adventures. Still, if you take your time to talk with every NPC, small hints will be given here and there. After a while, you’ll be engulfed in a series of mysterious events as your heroes try to figure out what is happpening in the world.\n\nCore:As with most RPG Maker games, you can interact with many things in the game such as pieces of furniture and every single person. Most of them will trigger a different dialogue than the previous one. I really like this and, if I’m not wrong, I think this is particularly popular practice in these games since they rely more on their story and characters to captivate the player. I also really like the small talk between your party members when you try to access a certain place which, you either are not supposed to go or someplace which you’ve recently visited. I find it a nice little touch, as opposed to just putting some kind of invisible wall or physical barrier to stop you from going there.\n\nOn some levels you’ll find tutorial books which teach you about a certain element of the game. These do a really good job on explaining basic things such as navigating the menus and explaining the combat mechanics. Right from the beginning the game teaches you how to play the game both with mouse and keyboard.\n\nOnce you exit the first town you’ll be able to explore the world, still, you can’t visit every single location right away. Everytime you proceed to a new zone (as in a different room/screen) the game will also display the name of your current location. The game rewards exploration and interacting with the surrounding environment, the maps are explorable and are filled with secret rooms and hidden loot.\n\nCombat:As with any RPG of this type, you’ll be spending a lot of your time in combat. When you encounter a fight you’re able to choose between Attack, Escape and Auto. Auto makes all your characters attack with their current weapon, while escape allows you to attempt to flee combat. If you select Attack you’ll be able to choose from different types of actions like: entering a guard state which allows you to receive less damage while also recovering some HP; using special abilities that either require spell points or tech points, which you can gain by taking damage or using physical attacks. Of course, you’ll also be able to use normal physical attacks with your weapons and use different kinds of items that you purchase or loot.\n\nAt the end of each battle you’ll receive a certain amount of experience points and different types of loot. Some loot is worth keeping to use during battles while some is best just to sell it in a shop. Loot includes things like potions, junk and equipment. That said, enemies don’t drop gold, so you’re encouraged to search the levels for hidden gold stashes and to sell your unwanted items at a shop.\n\nMinor cons:- I do realize that this is a very simple 2D game but atleast some barebones video options would be nice. The only thing you can change is windowed or fullscreen mode. I ended up playing on windowed mode mainly because the game looks prettier on a smaller window and because when I tried playing on fullscreen my framerate was on the 20s, as opposed to the solid 60 I get in windowed.\n\n- There were a few times in which my characters would glitch through a wall like it was some sort of secret path but that wasn’t the case. There was also this time in which I was unable to enter a secret room for some reason, I followed the secret path leading to it but my characters were hitting an invisible wall.\n\n\nOverall thoughts:The music isn’t anything that will blow your mind, but some tracks are pleasing to listen to, and I think they fit the whole medieval-fantasy theme going on. Visually I’m not really a fan of the look RPG Maker games have but that is a matter of personal taste.\n\nI found the plot to be rather interesting and it was the main reason why I kept playing the game. That, combined with a party based combat system, which I really enjoy, along with a rather simplistic loot system that rewards completing side quests and exploring by offering you better and unique equipment (in comparison to what you find in shops) made me enjoy my time with Undefeated.\n\nVerdict:While I don’t think that you’ll be missing a lot if you don’t play Undefeated, I think it is well worth your time if you pick it up on sale.","March 26","true","8.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

I have a few irks here and there about how the game is designed, but in general, found this a pretty fun play. I liked the 'find the hidden room' part of the game, which makes exploring quite interesting.\n\nA major irk for me that's worth mentioning was the ending in which the game just sort of ended abruptly, and the fact that you can't go back and replay to complete all the side quests and find all the hidden rooms/items which you've just sort of ignored while in pursue of the main plotline. This means that you've to attempt to complete all the side quests and search for all the hidden rooms etc far before the last stretch of the game, which is a bit unfeasible at points.\n\nBut other than that major point of irritation, this is still a game worth trying out for those who likes playing these nostalgic JRPG styled games.","October 1, 2015","true","18.4"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/recommended/332390/","morphicmetal","morphicmetal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/morphicmetal/","3532 products in account","Undefeated is an RPG/JRPG that starts you out as a bootlicker bottom of the barrel recruit for the local militia group in town.  You're a student conscript in training.  After a mission that ends up in a near disaster, you are plunged into the heart of a great dark secret, and only with the help of your team will the militia be able to figure out the central root of this great big mystery.  You must find the cause before the lives of many are endangered by a great plague of mutants beginning to infest the lands.\n\n\nPros:\nI love the emphasis they add to the search system.  There is a lot to find!  I have to admit that I search almost any and everything on RPGs when I play them, so I really like this!\n\nI like how big the achievements show up.  You easily know when you have gotten one.\n\nThe battle system interface is easy to understand if it is your first time playing an RPG.  Everything is clearly noticeable as it happens in battle.  More of a tutorial on the status effects might have been helpful for somebody new to them though.\n\nA lot of dialogue which is always nice.  I enjoy when characters have a lot of conversation, and there is a lot of commentary in this about a lot going on in the game.\n\nThe personalities really come out in this game, due to the mentioned dialogue above.  I am enjoying the characters and their distinct personalities and character they have.  It makes the journey a lot more fun as I go onwards in the story.\n\nThe secret rooms seem to be numbered in a direct sequence, so it is easy to know if you missed one somewhere if you check in the game menus out.\n\n\nCons:\nI couldn't get the controller working too well.  It seemed to be a little bit too sensitive for my liking, so I went back to the keyboard very shortly after attempting to use controller support.\n\nA little bit buggy in spots, as I will mention in glitches.\n\nA lot of enemy encounters (I am playing with invisible enemies).  It seems rather easy to over-level on normal mode.\n\nThe quests are a little confusing, since you pick them up in a somewhat linear fashion, but some of the older ones are found much later, and others are time sensitive, which I don't really like very much.\n\nDue to the point above, the music can get a little bit annoying, however I do like most of it overall.  This can happen in many JRPGs, as there tends to be few battle musics normally, so they can get a bit monotonous over time.\n\nI would enjoy having more types of skills diversity, or equipment variations, or just ways to play with my abilities a bit.  So far things are very linear, and there is not much I can do to customize or build characters in certain ways according to roles.\n\n\nGlitches:\n\nIn Heynton Pass Cave, there's a place you can walk through a wall to get to a treasure box.  If you walk only one pace, then move up, you can walk above the area, and circle around to the ladder to skip the Kingly Lizard boss entirely.\n\nAble to walk through another rock wall at Heynton Waystation.  This one only had a single square, and I could not move further.\n\nOther small ones here and there with areas I can walk through, but I stopped listing them.\n\n\nEarly Gameplay and Other Thoughts:\nSo, upon starting, you form a small group to explore town, and you end up gathering various quests as you talk to people.  There is plenty to gather if you search containers and other things around the town area as well.\n\nLater on you get connected with bigger secret operations to try and track down the cause of some sort of disease with mutant animals, and your job is to stop the root of the problem so it does not spread and endanger other people.\n\nThe characters are very likeable and have a lot of dialogue and personality.  I really like this facet of gameplay, and it makes things very interesting.  A particular Beriberu is very rude, saying some really off the wall commentary which I find funny.\n\nAs you progress and level, you gain more abilities and can use these special abilities with TP (technical points) or MP.  Without gear, the TP refills as you fight, and the MP will only refill when you rest, or move beyond certain points in the game.  The TP also refills if you guard, as does a little of your health.\n\nI wish there were a lot more items as well, or a system to use your items in various ways, like crafting, or alteration or other kinds of enhancements.  There could be a lot more in this area I think to make the game a bit deeper, but the overall experience overshadows small gripes like this for me.\n\nI've not played any other games that are similar with the RPGMaker style engines to compare this to, really, but it's a really nice, solid game so far for me.  I'm very happy with it, and I highly recommend this to anyone who likes the JRPG genre - especially if you want a more interactive and immersive character experience.  The focus seems to be on the various characters and their feelings and emotions about things, and I like how the game is done in this regard, where you can sort of understand specific traits characters have and sort of get to know them in a way.  Again, I think it's well done, and give it high marks overall.  Great RPG experience!\n\n** Disclaimer:  I was given a key to review the game.

But the characters are really well written. Their development and interactions during the events of the game feel "real" and believable. The dialogues make a good job in revealing their personalities and are often very entertaining, on top of that.\n\nAs in other similar games, you have 2D maps and turn-based battles on separate screens. What makes the game stand apart is the ability to use five party members in battles (instead of four) and the combination of spells and abbilities. Usually, in other games, you either have characters relying on mana and spells or on energy (or something similar) and abbilities. In Undefeated, some characters have both. And since TP (that's how energy is called in this game) replenishes by attacking or being attacked, it makes the resources much more fluid, especially in tougher battles, where you party takes a lot of beating.\nThe battles are generally well balanced, and the Legendary difficulty trully stands to its name.\n\nThe locations are fairly complex. Usually the "story path" is more or less straightforward, but there are many side locations. Thorough exploring can yield great rewards, and especially on higher difficulties locating the secret rooms is crucial. But these are cleverly placed and you should find at least some of them without too much troubles. What I missed a bit was greater variety of weapons and other equipment. Games like The Book of Legends or 3 Stars of Destiny are "richer" in this.\n\nOverall I enjoyed the game greatly. It felt very smooth and polished and was pleasure to play. Plus I forgot to mention the music - pretty good.","April 8, 2015","true","11.1"," 17 of 28 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","17","28","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/recommended/332390/","Psygineer","Psygineer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Psygineer/","1507 products in account","Introduction\nUndefeated is an RPG Maker game that sets itself apart from others by having a constant stream of banter. This banter makes the game feel much more alive and active than similar type games. Almost every time you collect a chest or find hidden stashes, the characters make pertinent comments. For example, the Magic using Archer is disappointed at the lack of magical items. There are characters getting excited when the group finds an item suitable for them and the general discussions of why there is even gold hidden in a log in the first place. They may also show disappointment about finding a low value item so late in the game. It all adds up to making Undefeated an enjoyable play that will keep you entertained for hours.\n\nWarning\nBefore I get in to the actual review, I feel compelled to point out there is a game breaking bug lurking just before the end of the game. The game will control itself for a short period but there is a wandering regular enemy that often gets in the way. Rather than going around the enemy or fighting it, the characters and the enemy just stare at each other forever without the fight triggering. There is a solution to this issue however. The interface is disabled due to being on auto-pilot so you will have to ALT-F4/End Task out of the game, and then relaunch it. Reload your save repeatedly until the monster is no longer in the way as it randomly moves about until you touch it. For me it took too many reloads to count and the funny thing was the only reason why I made the very last attempt was because I wanted to take a screen shot of the issue to send to the developer. With that out of the way, it’s time to get back to the review.\n\nGameplay\nThere are a lot of RPG Makers games on Steam already and I have played quite a few of them. Some are stellar with heavy modifications to the base engine, others are pretty much default assets poorly cobbled together by someone just learning the engine. Undefeated is in the middle ground. It has a few faults here and there with misplaced or missing blockers. You might have simply not even noticed if it wasn’t for the fact the game has you actively hunting for 25 secret rooms with great goodies in them. If you ignore those faults and the glaring bug mentioned above, Undefeated is a rather good RPG Maker game.\n\nAnother fault I can point out for the game is the way Quests are handled. Each one is numbered but there is often no clear cut indication of where you go to take care of the Quest or when you can actually access the next part of the Quest. One of the very first quests I received was one I couldn’t complete until I was almost at the end of the game. I read in other reviews that some of the quests are on a timer. While I didn’t notice any timed quests myself, it could explain why I was never able to find the next part of some of the quests.\n\nThe strong point for this game is the humour and sense of the characters being alive in it. As mentioned earlier, the characters interact often in the game. I rather liked that about Undefeated. It made me feel compelled to keep going in the game just to see what witty banter would come next. The characters themselves were interesting too for the most part. A good example of one of the comments made by a character was his was pointing out what a stupid idea it was to use a wooden chest to store items in a swamp/wet area. He pointed out that the items inside would just rot if the party had not been there to steal them. I also enjoyed the comments about thieves hiding their money in logs to explain why so many logs had gold in them.\n\nThere is nothing overly unique about the gameplay itself for Undefeated, other than the fact, the game allows you to link certain spells together for enhanced effect. The only combination I found was that you can use a water spell to try to wet an enemy character and then hit it with lighting. The game implies there are also other combinations but that is the only one that I actually discovered. You can’t really customize your characters at all in the game other than equipping stronger gear for them. There are no skill trees or skill points to deal with. I also found that despite checking every nook and cranny, I was chronically faced with gold shortages. The game does a very good job of providing you with better gear as you go. It is free if you are willing to hunt for it but there is not much variety in each class of weapon. For the most part, each character uses a unique weapon and armor type. This means that if you miss the chest containing your better weapon/gear, you will probably have a very long wait before you find a new one. There are shops available that allow you buy better equipment, but they have such high price tags that I couldn’t actually afford to buy them until after I had finally managed to find a better item.  My main character had the basic sword for almost the entire game due to that fact. It didn’t hinder gameplay but it was kind of sad knowing I missed a box at some point in time and therefore missed some of the fun witty dialogue that goes with it.\n\nOverall Undefeated is a fun RPG Maker game that has pretty much all the standard elements that you can find in turn based JRPG style games. If you are a fan of JRPG/RPG Maker style games, you should consider Undefeated. The bug I mentioned at the start of this review will likely get patched now that the developer has been made aware of it, and even if it isn’t, just reloading your save game enough times will let you progress past it.\n\nPros: Witty dialogue when finding items and character interactions that make the characters feel alive\nAbility to combine spells\nHidden rooms to discover\nBypass level option once an area is cleared. Once you found the exit to the area, you can skip straight to it in some areas or you can choose to reenter it\n\nCons:\nIt’s a little short; coming in at around 6-8 hours for a first playthrough. Perhaps less if you don’t search for hidden areas your first time\nGame breaking bug, but if you are patient you can get around it so it isn’t game ending\nNo customization options for characters and very limited gear options\nQuests, while given in a linear fashion, have no indication of when you can actually do them","April 3","true","24.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

That’s great news for you RPGMaker fans out there who just can’t get enough of the RPG goodness. This time it’s Undefeated which tells the story of three army conscripts who really don’t want to be there but know that they’re going to have to protect their nation.\n\nI believe that part of the storyline is an attempt at sending a political message about conscription. It’s an interesting topic. Australia has previously had conscription and I know of many countries around the world that still have mandatory service requirements. My personal stance is that if I was ever called upon to serve and protect my nation, Australia, then I’d do so in a heartbeat. But this is only natural given my father served Australia in World War Two and lost his hearing due to landmines exploding in his transport vehicle when the Japanese attacked. For those wondering I am a big fan of Japanese culture today, including their pro wrestling scene, and do not associate my father’s injury (that happened over 35 years before I was born) with Japan.\n\nThe game is about 6 to 8 hours in length and aside from the three primary characters you will meet others throughout the course of the game. Most of the characters that you meet have their own story, some of them longer than others, and when you adventure with them you’ll unravel the mystery about the wasteland. As far as the action goes it’s standard RPGMaker fare without anything really standing out to separate it from the pack.\n\nThe only real point of noteworthy criticism is the title’s abrupt ending. In many ways it feels as though the writer thought “That’ll do. It’s the weekend now and it’s time for some beers so we’ll just end it on that note and call it a day…” I felt that the game could have been put into the ‘special’ category had the ending been fully fleshed out. It’s still a good game but it could have been that bit better and sadly we’ll never know.\n\nUndefeated is an Aldorlea game therefore you know it’s going to be a solid RPGMaker experience from the get go. It isn’t their best game but it’s still solid. If only the ending was better.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular daily giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/\nFor our Steam group and curation feel free to join http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified","February 28","true","26.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The story revolves around 3  young people conscripted into the army and then sent to  gather information about a wasteland. Why they are conscripted is not stated as there is no war but all males and females are conscripted for 2 years service. What exactly is the wasteland is not clear though it does seem to be the result of a  fallout from some previous time. The characters are very likable - each with their own agenda and what they will do after their stint in the army. The game has a great sense of humour throughout with each character.A choice is given at the beginning of the game in the use of either the mouse or arrows, seen or unseen enemies and 4 levels. There is also the "go through" ability  once an area has been navigated saving time in repeated areas. Battles are turned-based and some of the characters have the use of TP- it is not something I like - would rather depend on MP. One team member has the abiltiy to make bombs if you find the recipe and the ingredients. There are 25 hidden areas as well a lot of items to be found lying around in areas and not  just in chests,.  15 side quests  are available too. The ending is somewhat abrupt leaving the player with questions but some hint is given as to what may occur. There are places on the world map that are not accessible leaving the player to wonder if a sequel was intended but never happened. It is a great game in itself - the mapping is beautiful as is the artwork. It  can be a rather short game if the side quests and finding the secret rooms are not attempted. Overall I would recommend it.","March 12","true","16.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are bright and the story was entertaining. There are side quests to finish and hidden rooms to find, so the game isn't just about the main quest. The only downside is that once you finish the main quest you can't keep playing the game. I give this game 9/10.","October 5, 2015","true","10.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The armour is awful, everyone hates them, and they're just tools to be thrown away. After they're assigned to a "training" mission, one in which the Captain in charge just plans to abandon them partway, things start to change. The animals in the area have been growing larger and more wild, and after the Captain is attacked, they start to get involved in a deeper plot.\n\nUndefeated is an around 6-8 hour turn-based RPG game. Along with Marcus, Bastien, and Fela, you'll gain other companions - some from the army, some from elsewhere - as you try and find out what is happening in the mysterious Wasteland. While it isn't a story that will stick with you forever, it is enjoyable for the time you'll play it. There are some grammatical and spelling errors to be found, along with some places that have a bit of weird pathing. Enemies can either be set to visible or invisible, and you have the ability to choose one of four difficulties.\n\nUndefeated is a slightly shaky recommend from me, but I do recommend grabbing it on sale.","November 14, 2015","true","12.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There has obviously been a lot of thought and dedication gone into this game, unlike other RPG maker games where they are rushed with typoes and mistakes throughout the game.\n\nGameplayThe way that this game is played is almost like any other RPG game, you have a quest to go on and you will be in the basic situation where you will have to kill enemies as you go through your adventure. Unfortunatly the balnacing of the battles don't seem to be that well balanced at times throughout the game, making little room for actual strategy and not just using your most powerful move over and over again. Apart from the balancing of the batling system on the game, all together this RPG maker game is really nice. The story is well thought out and interesting enough to want me to play more fo the game over time. There are a few side quests here and there, you are given a note so that you can remember what side quests you have accpeted and what to do in ech of the quests. With all of the tilesets that are produced, it does seem like they have used the defult tilesets on the RPG Maker system. Although this may seem lazy, they actually do the mapping rather well. The music that is played throughout the game is rather well chosen, for some of the 'boss fights' the music that they choose is really fitting to the intense battle.\n\nPros+ Nice mapping\n+ Interesting story & characters\n+ Great music choice\n+ Trading Cards & Achievements\n\nCons- Battling system seems to be a little unbalanced (in normal mode)\n- Seems like they used defualt tilesets\n\nResult / Final thoughtsAll in all Undefeated is a great RPG Maker game, with some great choices of music at the right times. The story is really interesting, interesting enough to keep wanting me to play more. The mapping in the great is well designed and exectued, with some interesting design in the way that they map some of the areas. Although, I would suggest going on the Hard difficulty for at least a bit of a challenge if that's what you want.\n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\nFor more reviews on a wide range of games, go and follow Good Games Giveaways & Reviews curator group here.","March 26","true","5.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

The ending of this game was AWFUL. 1. It's the most ANTICLIMACTIC ending in all of history (I have never been more unimpressed) 2. You have no clue that the game's coming to a close - OK, so out of nowhere you meet the guy on the cover, you battle him (it's almost like a regular filler battle) and then the credits start rolling...you're kind of just like "w-wha...?".\n\nI bought almost all of the games from Aldorlea during the Winter Sale - to see what their devs were doing, and maybe be inspired when it came to my own projects - but all of the games so far have been more of a lesson in what NOT to do.","January 10","false","7.9"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","0"
