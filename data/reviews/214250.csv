The post apocalyptic atmosphere is believable. The story feels genuine. But ultimately playing it felt more like a chore than entertainment. The game concepts sound great on paper, but fall short on execution. It tries to pretend it's open world, yet is completely linear. I tried to play as a passive person, purposely trying to save lives and ammo, but nothing I did or didn't do mattered. Just about everyone I encountered had to die because they were the aggressor and wouldn't step down. There was no way to talk my way out of any situation. And if I pointed my gun at someone without the intention of using it, they always attacked as soon as I lowered my weapon or tried to walk away. Killing people became routine and expected so eventually I just started shooting first.\n\nThen there's the stamina aspect which works well most of the time, until you unwittingly find yourself lost with no stamina to get back to safety, being forced to restart a level. And finally there's that genuine story which turns out to be nothing more than a dead end serving no purpose other than to keep the game moving forward. There is no closure here.\n\nAttaching the Ubisoft name to this title feels very similar to attaching the Gearbox name to Aliens: Colonial Marines--setting up high expectations, only to be disappointed.","April 21, 2015","false","8.5"," 169 of 196 people (86%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","86","169","196","6","0"

Don't get me wrong though, many things people complain about are true and the game really is relatively short (around 4 to 5 hours of gameplay) and abrupt, however it offers a very unique combat system and the overall atmosphere is pretty good.\n\nPlaying on hard difficulty you will be forced into hard resource managment (mainly ammo management, also water and other stuff), therefore you can't just wander anywhere you want neither can you shoot everything that moves, you have to force your enemies to surrender by threatening them into surrender with your (often times not even loaded) gun. I loved the concept and look forward to other games implementing it. The second most important aspect of the game is post-apocalyptic atmosphere, as mentioned above it is executed fairly well and the game feels somewhat unusual and therefore interesting.\n\nSurely, the game has it's flaws, they are mentioned in other reviews, However, I feel like most of them were brought up by people over-hyped by the game and therefore expecting it to be more than it actually can be. Some cons of the game I can think of is it's repetetiveness. Combat got somewhat repetetive but I am fine with that, what really annoyed me is climbing buildings over and over again (which was fun at first... but you can only climb so much without getting sick of it). And that's basically it, nothing else really stroke me during my first playthrough.\n\nTo sum up, I can recommend this game. Get it if it's on sale and you are looking for something post-apocalyptic with survival aspects and unusual combat system. Just don't put your expectations for it too high and you will enjoy it as long as you keep all those bad reviews off your mind while playing.","August 3, 2015","true","5.7"," 97 of 116 people (84%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","84","97","116","8","3"

Its a good 12 hours worth of bleak post apocalyptic survival so provided you don't mind the complete lack of comedic relief then all good. In all seriousness, its a very playable game with some very clever elements. Holding a gun with only one bullet (or empty in some cases) and facing off against 3 enemy makes for some very quick strategic thinking of who to take down first, and who you can bluff into surrendering. The world setting is fantastic and a very believable vision of downtown US after the apocalyptic "Event". It really does feel that genuine. The plot is good enough, though relatively straightforward and although a little clunky at times, the control are sufficient. Had a couple of graphic glitches, and one dead end point where an enemy didn't spawn so I couldn't make the next objective. Also find that getting the enemies into that precise point to make a "strike" was tricky and it would often revert to the "struggle kill" with no warning.\nThere's a good mix of the puzzle and platformer elements in the climbing sections and its challenging enough, even on the regular level setting.  Whilst the game is quite "samey" in that involves exploring climbing and a bit of combat, its fulfilling eough\nIts not a cheery game by any standards (its on a par with say, Dead Space in terms of optimism) but its one that made me pretty happy. Overall score is a very comfortable 8 out of 10","October 26, 2014","true","18.1"," 96 of 118 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","96","118","4","0"

Unfortunately, I ended up being severely disappointed.\n\nAt first, the setting and mood was excellent, kinda like The Road (although thankfully not THAT harsh). I actually liked the stamina mechanism, too. In most games, your character is apparently a machine who can run/climb/fight/whine for hours without breaking a sweat, so such a nod to realism also got things started on the right foot. Graphics I didn't have much problem with, either. Hell, I grew up in the NES era, so I can forgive a lot on that score.\n\nUnfortunately, I Am Alive went downhill pretty quickly from there. It's funny that I mentioned the NES, because this game actually reminded me of the old NES games... in all the worst ways.\n\nIt LOOKS like a GTA/Fallout-style open world at first, but looks are deceiving. I Am Alive is actually a linear game with constant barriers to keep you moving more or less along the one path. It's bitter that such an open-looking 3D world would offer so little room for exploration or experimentation.\n\nLooking at the map for the first time (before I became aware of this game's true nature), I actually wondered which streets I should take to the apartment. I thought "Okay, let's try those back streets, maybe less chance of being spotted by hostiles..." I soon learned that this game isn't big on exploration (or choices). That linear nature extended to the encounters, too. All too often, it felt like there was only one method or sequence to resolve things, with any other approach being punished brutally.\n\nThat latter issue is made exponentially worse by the SAVE POINT SYSTEM. Even better, with limited retries! This is what nailed this game's coffin shut for me, the realization that this game came out in 2012 and oh wow, game designers STILL hadn't learned better than this idiocy.\n\nNO. This is no longer 1984 where you have to fit your entire game in 4 megabytes and I'm still a kid with enough free time to waste hours replaying the same fricking map over and over. If you want to encourage players to get through the game in less than X lives in one sitting, then hey, great. Make an achievement or a score bonus or a "hardcore mode" or whatever for it. But don't punish those of us who aren't masochists with nothing more interesting to do.\n\nYou might think I'm a little hypocritical here, because I love roguelikes, which usually have permadeath and make you start over with a new character if you die. But the better ones (DCSS, DoomRL, ADOM, Sword of the Stars: The Pit) have random dungeons and classes that are very different from each other, so at least you can try something new if you die, with tons of room for exploration or just going some other way. I Am Alive should have borrowed more from that playbook if it wanted to be so harsh.\n\nTL;DR: This game is frustrating, stupidly linear, and has save points. Avoid.","December 22, 2014","false","2.0"," 77 of 101 people (76%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","76","77","101","4","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/8799644/recommended/214250/","8799644","Vegetarian Atheist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/8799644/","507 products in account","A rough hidden gem.\n\n(I beat this game originally on the PS3)\n\nOkay so it took Ubisoft: Shanghai 6 years to make the damn game and the age of it is immediately apparent.\n\nWhen I first laid my eyes on the game I could not believe the sight - the graphics were so horrendous that I died a little inside. I went on to adjust brightness and contrast to no avail; I could barely see any difference or improvement. The anti-aliasing in this game is about -2x or -4x, that's right MINUS. The jaggies are all over the place. The water is a mess. The textures are also extremely dated. I can't take screenshots on my PS3 (I could if the game was on Steam thank you very much) so I started taking photos with my phone and sharing it with my friend. He could not believe it either. Call me a spoiled PC gamer but the graphics really killed off a portion of immersion for me right off the bat. The graphics are below average, I am sure most console gamers will agree with me.\n\nHowever, one hour into the game and I was hooked. The civilization lays in ruins following a series of cataclysmic earthquakes and tsunamis; it's probably a pole shift. You arrive at the city in the search for your family with nothing but your back, some supplies, a flashlight and a camcorder (which is used for the cut scenes). Eventually get a machete, a gun, a shotgun and a bow. The game itself plays like a good survival movie. I've personally missed that genre for quite some time.\n\nIf you venture too far out into the dust-filled streets your stamina and health will slowly drain so you always have to make sure that you have enough supplies to replenish your stamina and health lest you suffocate and die. About that dust...It's been a year since the event and the dust still hasn't settled. So on one hand it's intriguing to not be able to see further than 6 feet away and struggle to get your bearings but on the other hand this trick can be viewed as a cop out on the part of the developers since they obviously haven't put much effort into graphics. The sound is good though. I played without the music. I liked the dead silence of the dead city.\n\nYou get to meet a total of 20 survivors in the game and help them out with supplies and other miscellaneous items so I advise you to save your supplies till the last and not use them until you meet someone who needs them. Helping every survivor will grant you an additional retry. This feature is helpful if you are playing on the survival mode which I heavily recommend for maximum immersion. Basically if you play on survival then you will be extremely cautions. And that's one of the biggest things that glued me to the game. It's that there is no trial and error here, you really have to think your moves ahead. I once got stranded on the other side of the mall and it took me my last two retries, most of my supplies and two pitons (used to rest while climbing) to find my way out. All in all, I spent about 30 minutes trying to find my way back in order to avoid starting the episode all over again.\n\nI am actually surprised that the devs managed to make climbing interesting. Uncharted was probably the first game to do so but this game implements much more realism and puzzle solving when it comes to that. You can play as Nathan Drake, hang on the ledge and then go make yourself a veggie sandwich. By the time you come back Drake will still be here, hanging on a cliff above the abyss. That won't happen in this game. There is a small cliffhanger almost every time you climb somewhere. You have to make out the path in your head and figure out if you'll have enough stamina to climb to your destination. Your stamina will start draining, the ominous music will set it and your palms might start getting sweaty in real life.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, well it delivers. When you aim you get the biggest, most ablest auto-aim I have ever seen in a video game. When you face the enemies you either have the choice of running, facing them head on, fooling them by attempting to do a surprise kill or subduing them by killing the leader of the gang. It's kind of like a checkers game. If you kill that one, then the two will rush you, if you kill that one then maybe you'll survive. If you try to rush the guy who has a gun with your machete then you will die. There are also a couple of stealth kills in the game. I have also exploited this trick to have the enemy AI shoot one of their own accidentally if you align yourself correctly. It worked every time and I saved myself health and ammo. About that ammo, yeah, the most bullets I was able to muster at one time in the game was 7 bullets.\n\nA few more things that hampered the immersion for me. You don't talk back to the survivors, ever, you just stand there and listen. The bodies of the slain enemies disappear unfortunately. Some food items mysteriously reappear in some locations. Many AI (a guy with harry potter glasses) reappear in the game. For a total of 50 something enemies they could easily made more AI models. You can also kill some peaceful civilians without any repercussions. Upon their imminent death they will likely curse you for taking their life when they meant you no harm. At one point in the game you may actually kill a kid's parents by mistake. The story was okay and I liked the bleak melancholic ending.\n\nAll in all in took me 8 hours to beat the game.  The whole game takes place around only 4-6 square city blocks. The game also only occupies 2GB of hard drive space. Ubisoft could have really turned this into a franchise. They could easily make a sequel or a prequel but I guess it's not on their priority list.","November 27, 2013","true","3.6"," 109 of 156 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","109","156","0","6"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/misterblammy/recommended/214250/","misterblammy","Hobo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/misterblammy/","511 products in account","I had really high hopes for this game. Before it came out, I remember seeing all kinds of press for it, screenshots of vast urban decay, hints of in-depth exploration, all the features that make a post-apocalypse fan salivate. Yet the hype for it died completely off after release, and I actually completely forgot it existed until I saw it on a Steam sale. I finally decided to pick it up and play it. Right from the start there were multiple things that bothered me. The game doesn't seem to want to go too far in any direction no matter what the choice is, and that makes it overall very bland right from the get-go. The game is incredibly linear, guiding you in a single direction and not letting you veer off the course, yet they have tiny outlets from your linear path where you can find consumable items and whatnot. It's not rewarding to get these though. There was virtually no effort put into finding it aside from ♥♥♥♥ing off somewhere that wasn't the objective and after a short 5 second walk it's sitting on the ground for you. Why didn't they have the ability to search for supplies? checking dumpsters, containers, or piles of debris would have added so much more to this than simply walking slightly left of where you were originally going to go. The interactions with the AI are just as linear as the exploration. There are two types of people in the game, the "I'm just trying to survive, morally you shouldn't shoot me" people and the "I'm clearly up to no good, you shouldn't feel bad shooting me" people. It makes it very cut and dry to be able to decide who to kill and who not to, and don't worry, if the game decides you shouldn't kill someone it does its best to prevent that. One of the first NPCs you meet in the game is a woman protecting her storefront/residence with a gun. If you walk in front of her, she'll point the gun at you and warn you to stay back. The game clearly wants you to just leave her alone and keep walking, but the game hints from the tutorial that you should have to make the choice yourself as to what you do in that situation. Yet in this situation, you have at most 1 round for your handgun, clearly dissuading you from shooting her. You have a machete, but due to her placement you can't sneak up to her for a stealth kill like you have just been taught how to do, and if you walk at her and try to kill her with it she immediately plugs you in the head and kills you. You're supposed to think "Well duh, that's how it would be in real life" but it is disappointing that they force that kind of situation on you with the facade of choice and moral decisions being involved when in actuality the game has forced your moral compass to point to "Good". This is just one of my many complaints about the game. The camera is horrible, switching between a free camera and being locked in certain angles that gets incredibly jarring. The combat is incredibly simple and redundant, as is the urban exploration with things like traversing obstacles, climbing ledges, hanging from pipes, etc.. The stamina meter built into the climbing is nothing more than, to use a cliche term, artificial difficulty. It's meant to add a sense of urgency, stress, or fear in the game, but yet they give you the simplest exploring mechanics of all time. All of it is incredibly safe. If you mess up an input, it's not like you fall to your death, you just sit there doing nothing. You can't fall off a ledge, there is no balancing on the beams as you cross them. It's meant to give you the feeling that it's dangerous, without actually giving the player any reason to be scared. All in all, the game is a major disappointment, and I can't say I would recommend it to anyone expecting an immersive or exciting game.","September 9, 2015","false","0.9"," 81 of 115 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","81","115","2","0"

Probably most of the pictures I took were uploaded for this game only. I am still perplexed why people call this game ugly. It's environment is simply gorgeous. I look at the big picture here not tiny details such as not near perfect antialiasing or the highest HD textures available in current generation video games. Simply the city our protagonist arrives to looks stunning and depressing and superb. This desolate city is characterised by grey and white colours due to the fog, dust and toxic waste present and the beams of the sun shining through the sky are the most beautiful I have ever seen in a video game. Those being more expert in this area will probably challenge me - I have found this game visually stunning, regardless. I took numerous pictures especially when you climb the skyscrapers - those sequences are outstanding.\n\nGameplay-wise I Am Alive is a rather difficult TPS game. Even a single enemy can easily kill you. You have melee weapons at your disposal and any firearms you have provide you only with limited ammo. You need to plan every single encounter very carefully. The only letdown when it comes to this game its shortness. It can be completed in 5 or 6 hours with all side missions completed and collectibles obtained.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/recommended/214250/","antwog","Antwog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/antwog/","192 products in account","I Am Alive is actually a very refreshing and entertaining game.\n\n- Through the dusty city in fictional city Haverton in America, there was a backstory known as 'The Event', that apparently was a bunch of earthquakes, though the backstory of post-apocalyptic essentially is present. The story is a series of events that occur in Haverton, which I must admit use a variety of buildings and adventures in order to fulfill the objectives, refreshing. The overall story is powerful through emotionally engaging with characters, for example, Mei and her mother. The story does tend to rush at the end as that could have been spaced out, though I will admit the ending is very strong and I was completely shocked by the ending. Oh, its a cliffhanger too.\n\n- The graphics are beautiful in the game. For a 2012 game, they are at a high standard for that point in time. Speaking of Ubisoft, in 2012 they had a high standard of graphics in each game they released, which was their year in relation to graphics. The atmosphere and environment and the day/night dynamic is excellent graphically, though there could be some more day/night variations.\n\n- The gameplay is solid. I do like the motions of the character and how he engages with the environment, which I felt was again for a lack of better word, refreshing, though different to other post-apocalyptic games. These same motions however, could be expanded a lot more. For example, if your character is on the ground, your stamina will deplete due to heavy dust that will affect it and eventually your health. The character walks basically like he is having a stroll as if there was minimal dust. To combat this, more diversity in actually producing motions when in the heavy dust could add a further dynamic to the gameplay. Stamina added a new dynamic to the game, which I appreciated. I liked the fact that this element suggested planning more so you as a player wouldn't deplete your stamina as fast as if you just went out there, so it was nice. I did love the element of preserving your bullets, as they could come in at handy times. There are a limited number of bullets in the game, and you do need them, though thats why planning is essential.\n\nRegarding crooks and other gang members, I loved that element in the game, though it did get repeatitive as it was too basic. So everytime you walked up to a crook, you would have to kill him essentially, no reasoning, nothing, just plain old re-shooting the guy, whilst good, repeatitive. The camera control is an absolute pain. For example, whilst on a cliff and you look at the scenery and attempt to plan what portions of the building you have to climb, the camera will literally screw you up by making you deplete stamina because the camera was not facing the direction your player was moving at.\n\n- There were bugs regarding graphics and gameplay that could have been ironed out, and balancing regarding camera control would have been appreciated. It didn't overly affect the game, but it was noticeable. Not as bad as some games I'll mention. Here are my pros/cons based off this review...\n\nPros:\n- Strong story and backstory.\n- Beautiful graphics.\n- Day/Night dynamic, Atmosphere, and Environment are very good.\n- Solid gameplay.\n- Lovely balance overall.\n\nCons:\n- Rushed ending to story.\n- Day/Night could have been used more to enhance particular missions, apparently according to the main character near the end, the entire sequence of events happened in a day...\n- Vague, but gameplay could be expanded upon.\n- Bugs.\n\n\nOverall, I Am Alive is a good game. It has its positives and negatives, however it has a very good foundation to build upon. The gameplay was solid, though it was basic for this genre and could have been more diverse to enhance the game. The story was strong, and the graphics were great. I do recommend this game at $17.99, however it is you, the readers, choice because I played this game on easy mode (there are 3 or 4 levels of difficulty) and it took me 8 hours to complete the game. So expect at least 10+ hours if you do the side-quests as well, as in help the surviviors. I did this partially (7/20). Score: 7.5/10\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention, dialogue is excellent in the game. Every set of people, be it main characters or thugs had dispirate dialogue, enhancing the game. I loved that aspect. Since I forgot to mention that, I'll bump my score from 7.25-7.5/10.\n\nEDIT 2: This game lets you run your mind run wild on what happened to Haverton, what happened at the ending. It leaves a lot of aspects open for interpretation which works for this game. I forgot to mention, this game sometimes can feel like a chore to play, but personally that is what happened to me when I raged that I kept dying in the dust :p\n\n----\n\nThanks for reading my review!

Really, really disappointing.\n\nThere are some games that, when I see them, I get hooked and tend to ignore most bad reviews. Sometimes, that is a wise choice, as I have found MANY games that I've loved that had terrible reviews all around. But other times, that is a terrible move, as the reviews are true.\n\nIn this case, the bad reviews are true. I am Alive is, well, terrible.\n\nI was hooked since the first trailer ever released, and I never played it until now. Now, I wish I hadn't. I didn't want to just drop the game, as I hate doing that, so I just tried to play through as quickly as possible, ignoring the in-game achievements. Thankfully there are no Steam achievements, as I would hate to see the partial completion in that.\n\nAnyway, to the point: Don't buy this game. The controls are horrible. Getting a controller helps, but it's still wonky. The combat is no good. You can sneak attack someone, which is cool at first, but it wears off. Besides that, you can shoot people but ammo is TERRIBLY scarce. I understand that this game is survivalist, but your guy has been out there forever, and he begins the game with like a water bottle and that's it.\n\nThe only other way to fight is with your knife. If the combat was more action-oriented, then it would have been better. Instead, you're usually screwed when fighting gangs. Your only knife attack (besides the sneaking one to get the first edge-up) is to run up to someone's face and proceed into a button-mashing event while you're left open to all other baddies. Your guy can't just stab and slash in an active manner. Instead, he can only lock his knife with the other guy and sit there while being shot. And each time he's shot, the event has to be restarted.\n\nTherefore, combat is terrible. It should have been more fluid and action-oriented.\n\nAnd as for the climbing... God, such a pain. I liked what they were trying to do at first, but then got over it quickly. Again, it's a survivalist game, but it is just too much. You have a fatigue meter which, when you lose enough fatigue, also will lose its capacity. If you don't have items to restore capacity, you're screwed and usually find yourself in a vicious circle of needing to find items which require either (a) ammo to shoot a lock or (b) you to climb somewhere. But chances are you're looking for ammo already, or you're looking for an item to help you climb. So often you're forced to restart places or re-attempt entire sections.\n\nAnd the graphics--they look like someone digitalized sawdust and filtered it through the imagery. The game can still look ugly and apocalyptic without looking... THAT kind of ugly.\n\nThere's more issues, as I found many glitches along the way, the story was lackluster, and on and on and on.\n\nOverall, I was terribly disappointed.

You're brought into a world/environment that could be rife with background and stories but somehow they manage to leave you (or me, at least) feeling both wanting to know more about it and also not caring about what is told about what happened. A lot fo the comments about whatever took place feel like a passing explanation - as if no thought has been put into it and just trying to brush it off.\nThe main character's story/search feels COMPLETELY dismissed for 95% of the game. I can understand being a character that wants to help people but when it comes to the point of getting home and not finding what you wanted, right there it seems to be thrown onto the backburner. The character says now and then "Oh I'm here doing this" - NO YOU'RE NOT! You get thrown on everyone else's errands. When it does loop back to the point he is going to continue onto his search, I found I just couldn't care less anymore.\nWhen it comes to the controls, they just seem...off. I kept finding myself climbing down onto ledges without meaning to, not being able to jump down or climb up when I NEEDED to - leading to me dying. Or aiming at an enemy and suddenly it aims at the one without the gun, or on one occassion I found I died because while trying to aim at a particular enemy the auto-aim just kept looping through the FOUR that were closing in on me. And it's so very repetitive! There's so much climbing that it just ends up with no tension as your stamina decreases because you've seen/heard it a million times, and it just feels like a chore. I thought things would get more interesting when they brought in the rope-swing but found it only gets used a couple of times, and then it's so stiff and lifeless that it just sucks you out of the game further.\nI've actually recorded this as a series on my YT channel and the honest reason I continued it until the end was how ridiculous it was trying to do anything. Parts were rage-inducing, but mostly it was laughable at how stupid it all seemed. I'm glad I played through it just so I know how rubbish I found it, but I would recommend others to just go onto YouTube and watch it.

The trailer versus the end result did leave me wanting though, I expected a bit, no, alot more.\n\nThis is an unfinished game to say the least, it won't take you more than a few hours to complete, and once you do, you don't feel like you did anything really, it's not an open world game, HAH! you wish.\nThe only hint you get as to what happens when this is all done, is that your character is 85% dead, and 15% Missing in action.\nNot a good ending for an otherwise decent game. I just wish the game had an open world, and was a little more fleshed out, as well as having a dynamic day-and night cycle, but nope.\n\nIt's been a few years since this game came out, so let my in-game time speak for itself, i completely finished this games storyline.... Three times. sooooo, 23 divided with 3? That makes a little more than 7 hours per playthrough.\n8 hours is the average minimum playsession For a person like me, take a guess how I felt after beating this game the same day I bought it. Not very pleased.\n\n\nNow then, as for mechanics? there's alot of nice aspects here, but also alot of pit-falls. You'd think your character could climb stuff, right? Nope, only when it's an obvious spot. If you can't obviously see the spot to climb, you can't climb it. And even then, it doesn't feel natural.\n\nE V E R Y T H I N G that happens in this game is scripted to happen, down to even the ''loot'' you can find, oh, and it doesn't appear to respawn either, if it does, i've been too quick doing the quests in this game, since there was literally nothing else to do.\n\ncombat is a pain in the ♥♥♥, that's all I can say. I can't really remember it well, but I don't think your character can swing his weapon at all, if he can, it's so slow that any enemy can just interrupt you. And ammo is so scarce, that you'll want to save it till the last part.\n\nYou are going to die ALOT int this game, and 75% of your deaths, are going to be cheap shots. with about half of those cheap shots being developer created pitfalls in the climbing areas in this game.\n\n\nSo, what can I say? I don't recommend this game, had it been longer, maybe. If they had made this an open world game, and added sidequests? Definitely.\nBut as it stands, I can't say yes to this game, not for this price, wait for it to go on sale. It's definitely something you'll want to try, but don't spend your hard earned cash expecting this to be a revelation of some sort.

For a budget game it has mostly exceeded my expectations by managing to perfectly encapsulate the scarcity of resources and that dusty, ruble-y ruined post apocalyptic world setting. Though my favorite aspect of the game would have to be the mind games you're forced to play with your enemies. Imagine having to shoot the biggest guy in the group with your bow in hopes of getting the smaller ones to surrender, then whipping out your handgun with 0 ammo in order to intimidate the remaining foes just so you can retrieve your only arrow from the corpse to kill off some more scavengers with it. Secondly its a console port with a weird ♥♥♥ control scheme, sure you can rebind the keys but its still felt pretty weird, I think its best played with a controller although you'll most likely be fine with kb/m and Thirdly I did not experience any performance issues with it at all, it ran at a constant 60fps all the way through, the only problem is that its locked at 60 even with vsync off and editing the config file did not unlock the buttery smooth 144hz experience.\n\nnoUplayFTW /10","August 28, 2014","true","5.2"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","19","31","0","0"

The desaturated color pallette common to movies and games that share similar themes like Fallout, The Road, Rage, Book of Eli, Mad Max and other post apocalyptic media fits the game perfectly. Unfortunately, it also garnered the game a lot of negative attention from whining casuals who only see overall trends in gaming and don't judge games based on their merits.\n\nI Am Alive is the story of a guy who was away from home when weather disasters destroyed the world [ostensibly] and has spent every moment since trying to get back to his wife and daughter. The game combines recognizable platforming with beautiful post-civilization landscapes, but also features melee and gun combat more akin to a realistic survival game (at least until the latter part of the game where you get a lot of ammo). Ammo is scarce and healing items more scarce. Everyone you encounter is an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ trying to kill you, and even some of the people you try to rescue will try to trick you into being killed like a lot of random NPCs in Witcher 3 or GTA5 will do.\n\nThe story is predictable, and I'm not sure if the title of the game is supposed to be ironic or not, but I wish that the Chinese sect of Ubisoft that developed this were working on a full fledged sequel or re-imagining. Really the negative aspects of this game are the low fidelity graphics and the awful controller support on PC - not to mention the obvious lack of Steamworks integration for things like achievements.  I really wish the controller mapping was functional, because it makes this game all but unplayable on computer.\n\nIf you can look past that or use something like Controller Companion, this game is worth the time of anyone who likes platformers or post-civilization games.","April 30","true","20.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","2"

Granted, you shouldn't play the whole thing in one sitting. Also because it's fairly short. But considering it probably never was planned as one, nor was it given the budget to be a major release (and it shows), the end product turned out great imho.\n\nThe atmosphere and graphics are decent, the gameplay too. Yes, the camera rotation and player movement tend to hickup every now and then, but not in a 'deal-breaker' way.\n\nAnother thing I thoroughly enjoyed was that there wasn't 'one correct way' to get from A to B. Sure, when it came to getting from one quest location to another, the game is pretty linear, but at the locations themselves you can get into dead ends, so this will force the player to really think their actions through. Which is refreshing.\nIt is also refreshing, because the game WILL punish you if you are careless. Or reckless.\nAnd it is very thorough in doing so.\nForget saving at will. You get checkpoints. And you get limited retry tokens. Stamina depleting during climbing also makes you reconsider the routes you take.  None of that willy-nilly climbey monkey BS in Assassin's Creed. :P\nBullets? Limited. Arrows? Better strategize, because you need to draw it first and that gives your foes plenty of time to run up and butcher you.\n\nThe only thing I didn't really like was the lack of closure in the storyline. I mean, not to divulge any spoilers, but it really leaves the player thinking like it ended too soon. Like there's a chunk of the story we didn't get to see/play/experience. And that is a pity. Yet Ubisoft has obviously it's priorities and funds elsewhere.\n\n\nOh, and before I forget - best part?

It's immense atomsphere of post-apocalyptic city with no usual zombies aboard just made me forget about all the weak spots (and there are lots of them). Really deep immersion into the setting. You feel alone, scared and depressed all the time. As I already mentioned there are no zombies or aliens or any other fictional stuff. It is a sad grey quest through desolated concrete jungle filled with murderers, rapists and few normal people who are mostly busy with... well, dying. Some gameplay mechanics (such as stamina loss when climbing or suffocating on the bottom levels covered with dust) came out to be very good ideas for making the game closer to real life. Lack of supplies makes it more challenging - you won't be running around with pockets full of different types of ammo and various goods.\n\nHowever, if we speak about the tech part, I Am Alive is far from perfect. I would say that the graphics are very avearge for a product of 2012. It feels more like a game of 2008. The makers did pretty bad job for a product that has been in development for like 5 or 6 years. Sometimes it felt like the they didn't put much effort in this title (especially when everyone were waiting for The Last of Us which came out a year later).\n\nAnyway, I do recommend this game for anyone who likes post-apocalyptic settings.

The first is atrociously awful combat, where you are saddled with an avatar who has only two combat moves and both are ridiculously hobbled. The first is shooting a gun, which is effective in dealing with enemies but ammunition is purposely in extremely short supply. The second is melee combat, but the only move you can make is to grapple with an enemy and jab a knife into their midsection, and that move can be interrupted by getting hit. Essentially this means you are helpless against groups, because you won't have enough ammunition to take down all the enemies and melee is impossible against more than one person. Of course, the game frequently throws you against groups. Toss in a hobbled save-game system (save-points, and only a handful of retries before you have to restart the entire level) and combat becomes a game-killer.\n\nThe platforming, the other half of the game, is too cumbersome and limited to make exploration enjoyable, and the dreary, limited graphics mean you won't want to wander the world anyway. The game does open up some after a while, becoming far less linear than its first few levels make it appear, but there's really not that much to do in the world so there's no point. And just when you think you are starting to make progress, the game suddenly ends, with no resolution or even a climax.

However, after awhile, I did notice some flaws. First, all bandits and survivors seem to hide out in buildings that are undergoing some kind of construction. The obvious reason for this is that construction offers a lot of pipes and ledges for you to implement the primary gameplay element of climbing/platforming. Logically, it's idiotic. The "event" that caused the apocalpse in the game has left most buildings damaged, and yet somehow these UNFINISHED buildings are left standing along with all of their scaffolding, tools, and materials intact? That's just stupid. Furthermore, EVERYTHING is gray. I get it, apocalypse= dirt covers everything, but dam, cars should still come in multiple colors at least! These two flaws combine so that every area is the same crumbling/under construction gray building, and it gets boring to look at really fast.\n\nGameplay\nDon't believe the trailers, this game is a climbing/platformer. I would liken it to assassins creed, but it's not as fast or intuitive as that game. The climbing in this game is SLOW, but worse than that it is also tedious. You are given a stamina meter and it runs out extremely fast, which makes sense to make it challenging, but there are several moments that are absolutely unforgiving. There are areas where you literally have to scale a building, and there is a veritable maze of pipes and ledges that you must navigate absolutely perfectly, or your stamina runs out and you fall to your death. This wouldn't be a problem if you could just look and plan a safe route, but often it's simply trial and error because you can't see where there's a ledge for you to stop and regain your stamina. To top it off there is a permanent stamina loss mechanic, where you can extend your cimbing time using up the stamina meter itself! This mechaninc is completely artificial because the devs obviously set up some climbing puzzles to require you to use it, which means you would always have failed those sections without it. The combat is also idiotic. You have a gun and a machete, but combat only occurs in two ways: a stand-off/bluff and a quick-time event. You never have more than three bullets for your gun, so when you encounter enemies you have to quickly draw on them, shoot the one who has a gun first, (or he will shoot you even while you are pointing a gun at him), and then "juggle" the other two with commands, environmental traps, and your machete. Can you swing your machete? NO. It uses a ridiculously long QTE where the enemy always blocks your attack and you have to mash the button to kill him, which gives plenty of time for his friend to run up and kill you. So you end up telling them to back up until you can kick one over a ledge, or make him step in a fire, and then kill the last one with a QTE. It was this terrible gameplay that inevitably made me put down the game. I spent an hour at one point figuring out the perfect climbing path up a building that required the least permanent loss of stamina, and after I reached the top I was immediately greeted by three enemies, who took me around 8 tries to defeat. Ultimately, just boring!\n\nStory\nThis isn't really a spoiler, but you are looking for your family. Surprise, surprise, you were separated from your family after an apoclyptic event! That NEVER happens! Don't get me wrong, the "find your missing family" storyline could have been great, and even starts fairly promising with a scene at your house where you pick up a few clues as to where your family may be. I was honestly looking forward to a story where your wife left litle clues behind everywhere she went that you would follow to inch closer and closer to her. But guess what? After that first scene in your house, you NEVER look for your wife again! Sure that is your "long-term" goal, but for the duration of the this game, you are on one long side quest to help out someone else. Yep, the entire game is spent helping ONE other person that your character is not related to or knows in any way. This is reason #2 why I stopped playing, I genuinely didn't care about what my character was doing. It doesn't even make sense! You encounter like twenty life-threatening situations just for this one stranger!\n\nTechnical Note\nI have a very good PC and a newer AMD Radeon GPU, and I had to make some serious tweaks to my system to stop the environment from completely disappearing! I can run far Cry 4 on max settigns, but this game made me spend a few HOURS just to see the dam floor! Also, you cannot play it with anything but a gamepad. Using a keyboard and mouse make the camera stutter every 3-5 seconds and it is absolutely enfuriating.\n\nDon't buy this game, because I am confident that you will have the same experience I had. You will be really excited about the apocalyptic story and atmosphere, and you will be wooed for the first couple of hours, until you start to smell something, and then the smell will grow and grow until it makes you stop playing. Later the next day you will realize the smell was coming from the sh!t this game is made of.","August 5, 2013","false","4.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I really enjoyed I AM ALIVE but once you look at the game on the paper it pretty much sucks.\n\nOn the plus side we have:\n+Fun.\n+Good Story.\n+A decent morality system that I will talk about in a second.\n+The difficulty is nothing crazy but satisfying.\n+SOME good character dialog.\n\nOn the other hand we have:\n-The awful Graphics.\n-The bad combat system.\n-The game took me around 5 hours to complete and I also did most of the side missions.\n-Minor bugs(nothing too bad)\n-That annoying dust filter in sequences where you are outside of the dust.\n\nThe (kind of) morality system:\nNow there isn't much of a real morality system other than a few things like "don't steal", don't eat humans". Those things will give a small boost to your endscore. However I found myself thinking about my victims as you will often find yourself in a place where YOU raid a camp. The bad thing  about this that instead of actually putting some people that are innocent where you can kill them to make you think about who you shoot. I only killed 3 innocents while playing and every time there was a way around them, the game however does not give you the possibility to skip "bad" guys(yoiu CAN skip some but it is usually much harder). Then again you have the possibility to execute your enemies which will give you no bonus other than the feeling of justice/douchbaggery(maybe, that is).\n\nFinal Verdict:\nI had a lot of fun with this game and it didn't frustrate me at all, the story is good but the price is a bit too high. I'd say buy it but maybe wait for a sale, unless you are a huge fan of post-apocalyptic games then grab a paysafe card and buy this little UBI pearl.\n\n~AndGeo","July 28, 2014","true","6.0"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","0"

This is an absolutely terrible port of the game. The control scheme, while interesting, was not ideal. Not unplayable, but not easy to get used to. The gameplay itself was ok, but the movement and the action was the worst part. I had huge difficulty getting through one of the first fight scenes. I can't say whether this was from the difficulty curve being too steep, or the controls not functioning properly, or just simply the game mechanics being terrible, but whatever the reason, it wasn't enjoyable. To touch briefly on the movement, it goes along with the controls being bad. Again, I'm sure if I had played more, I would've gotten used to the button mapping, but I've played a lot of games with a lot of different control scemes, and this was by far the most unique. To use mouse 1 to sprint, and to repeatedly tap it to run faster is unheard of. I'm aware that I could remap the buttons, but I shouldn't have to remap almost every button. Overall, the game was just not impressive, and frankly, not very playable. If you're are a very forgiving and lenient gamer, then you may enjoy this game, but I simply could not overlook the broken mechanics. Perhaps on a different console, it would be more enjoyable. 3/10.","December 30, 2014","false","0.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I'm not talking about the story, which is half baked and clearly cuts off well before whatever script the developers were working off of ended. I'm talking about the fact that every single moment of the game was spent remembering how excited I was after the first trailer came out, promising an open world exploration that never ended.\n\nInstead, the final product was this ♥♥♥♥. The game gets repetitive after the first level, and nothing actually happens. There is no open world, just some ♥♥♥♥♥♥ unfulfilling side missions that were clearly tacked on in a desperate attempt to make the game seem deep.\n\nI do like the almost but not quite monochrome stylings of the graphics, they addded a nice touch to the ambiguously post-apocalyptic wasteland that I barely got to properly explore.\n\nAt some point it became necessary for the player character, whose name I already forgot, to lash a young girl to his backpack and ♥♥♥♥ around sheer walls for a while. This was very annoying...\nTo repeat my previous point, I am Alive was originally meant to be a massive adventure through a broken world, like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. with platforming elements.\nThe last thing I need is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ plot device hooked to my character, constantly reminding me of how good this game would have been if it hadn't hit so many problems during development.\n\nThe main character dies at the end, you don't find out why. Presumably, somewhere between the end of the game and the credits, he went on aforementioned huge exciting journey without the player.\n\nDon't buy this game.

I found it to be extremely easy, but it's a decent game nonetheless.  However, these are some key issue that I would like to point out.  The main issue is that there is almost no back story.  I know, people will think 'but there has to be, even a little.'  Well, there is a little, but it is only learned through playing the early stages.  Other than that, however, there is no general narrative that sums up the state of the world at or before the time of the game.  Now, this isn't to say it's a horrible game.  It is interesting, but it's more like a demo of plausible video game features, rather than an actual game.  I would also say that it's fairly short.

Looks great right? I remember E3 2008 and said to myself, "This game looks great!", although I knew it was a cinematic trailer, it was the initial concept of survival and escape from hordes of other humans that were possibly your friends prior to "The Event", as it's called in the published version of the game, that stood out to me.\n\nThe game we got? Well, it went through a lot of changes as it was already in development for like, five years prior to E3 2008, and then released in 2012, went through even more changes. The biggest change is that you don't experience "The Event", okay, it's a big f*cking earthquake. But how awesome would it have been to experience that as part of the game?\n\nInstead, I Am Alive takes place a year later as your character returns to the city of Haventon to find his wife and daughter, how original. Instead, you find some girl named Mei who's just crying in the playground by your house, so you help her find her mother instead, as well as some bloke in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring the game, you can help strangers that actually need it, or kill people that are hostile. It's a very black and white game, literally too. Instead of the nice, yet muddy, colors of the initial trailer, Ubisoft Shanghai rapes your eyes with an over abundance of black and white, mostly white, film grain. The dust is thick, foggy thick.\n\nLet me remind you that this game came out in 2012. The textures and models from Super Mario Sunshine are better, and that was 2002. The gameplay tries to emulate the Assassin's Creed climbing, but somehow messes that up. And the shooting mechanic switches you from 3rd person survival game, to 1st person shooter.\n\nThis game's just doesn't really do anything right, except for the limited ammo which would make sense considering the stuff doesn't just appear out of nowhere.\n\nIt's mediocre.\n\n5/10","April 22, 2014","false","6.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yes I know - it is developed for the XBOX 360 and PS3 but I can't drop the feeling that I have seen better graphics in part on a XBOX or PS2.\nThe music at the beginning is good and adds to the little bit of atmosphere there is at all - but it gets so repetitive after a time (especially as you loose stamina constantly and with you loosing stamina the music builds up and always the same tune) that you sometimes just want to mute the whole game.\nSo now we know that the game itself is just a common stone between pearls and diamonds in terms of audio and graphics, but there are these rare jewels that suck at this too but still have great gameplay and story.\nThis game is absolutely NOT one of them.\nThe gameplay is overall horrific with the exception of the climbing mechanic.\nCombat or stealth - it gives you no choice - you have to fight.\nThere is no sneaking (although they implemeted the sneak button how cool is that) at all, the moment you pass a certain point the game spawns enemies and you can not get around them either because they detect you on the spot or you desperately try to get by the ones that are already somewhere in the level - and the level is created so that you have to get through them.\nThis is no "THIEF" at all.\nSo lets "fight" which comes down to coerce the AI in getting stuck or other "special" movements.\nWhy?\nBecause you either have guns - for which you practically never have any ammunition or you can use your mighty machete.\nNonono, not hacking and slashing, you have to wait until your enemies have reached you and then you can draw your machete for one hit.\nIf it is someone with a machete he will block it and you have to go through button smashing, it is easier if the enemy has a gun, then no button smashing.\nThe only problem is that these guys come in packs.\nSo the moment you have to buttonsmash and are locked in the scripted killscene, our enemies friends are hacking you to pieces OR his gun equipped buddies just kill you with one shot (ok,ok @ higher difficulty)\nThe AI can shoot at you forever but if you loot them they magically have emptied everything they had after 1001 shots (one of the many bugs in this game shows you that fact when you get stuck somewhere in a wall and they use you as invincible target practice or you just run around eating up your health items just to see how often they can fire) if you are lucky there is one bullet left after you killed them, about 50% of the time the gun is empty although the owner of it WILL kill you with it if you believe that you could reload the level and just walk past by him.\nYes I have the feeling that the people working at this game desperately wanted to shoot themeselves after they saw what they had created and implemented this thoughtful underlying message of the last bullet.\nYou can get a shotgun in the game but first you really have to do some climbing and exploring and the few shots you have are the only ones in the whole game.\nAfter around 75% of the game you get a bow with one arrow - oh and you won't believe it - YES!! you can reuse that arrow.\n\nThe story is pretty mediocre, you should have encountered it somewhere else already and probably better told but worst of all it is pretty shortlived (around 8 hours and I took my sweet time) and cut at the end.\nThe ending is one bad joke.\nI couldn't help but think that at some point of production they really believed they had born a new superloved AAA title hence the dream of producing dlcs and a second game.\nBut when at the end they realized what a boring abomination they helped to bring into this gamingworld they just hurried up and forced some kind of ending in and a really bad one too.\nThe bottom line is that if you really want to try out this game buy it in a Steam Sale...for up to 3 $/€.\nAnything more will make you wish you had tossed that money in a blender and watched it blend - more entertainment for the buck.","July 21, 2014","false","15.0"," 24 of 45 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","24","45","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Polterpneuma/recommended/214250/","Polterpneuma","Polterpneuma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Polterpneuma/","906 products in account","First off, I would like to state that I have yet to complete this game out of sheer frustration.\nThough I will keep on attempting to finish the game,\ngranted if I can win the race between me finishing the game and my controller breaking.\nThat being said, here are my two cents about this game.\n\nI will start off with the bad side of the game in order to create a critique that feels like you are eating a pudding with glazed sugar layered at the bottom, where the further you go and eat in more of the chunks, the sweeter it gets.\n\nI Am Alive was once an extremely anticipated game when it was first leaked on 2009, and announced to be completed on 2010, but was later pushed back several times before finally being released on 2012. This gave potential buyers the time to ponder about the game.\n\nWhen news first befell unto my ears, I heard so many rumors that this game would become the ultimate open world survival game with a good storyline to follow through. However, like any fairly hyped games, you are bound to be disappointed.\nThe final product released into the market looked like a stillbirth compared to what people were expecting from the game.\nAs a result, the game's popularity sank faster than a fat lady trying to water skii whilst wearing lead shoes.\nGranted, this is not entirely the developers' fault, as speculations may have created greater expectation, but could be easily diminished by not being so hush about the game's situation and deliver actual information and updates rather than popping up ever so often just to deliver push-backs.\n\nOver the course of some five hours of me playing this game, I can sum up the game in three words, "Trial and error."\nBy using new players' naiveté, the game would constantly throw you into situations where you are required to know beforehand what you are facing, to which usually results in death, and because of the limited retry system, this is like someone giving you a slap in the face and then proceeded to light your head on fire, as the system adds more than a big slap to the face, to which I will elaborate in a moment. I have found myself setting the game to the easiest difficulty to allow myself to go through all the death hoops the game presents to me with my trial and error technique in order to become acquainted with said death hoops, just so I would not light myself on fire on the normal playthrough.\n\nThe second thing is the delusion of difficulty, not illusion, but delusion. For some reason, the developer thought that simply by limiting the amount of retries the player can have in a trial and error game, the game would be interesting and challenging. If that were the case, then Honey Boo Boo's mother is a supermodel, and telling people to limit the amount of times they can urinate a day is a good idea.\nLook, we have all gone through the age where that formula worked, where you played, died, and subsequently receive a game over screen. That was when the existing technology limited the amount of content that could be present in the game, and so by using that retry formula, the consumers would have the illusion of getting their money's worth. I have had my fair share of Contra and Ghouls 'n Ghosts already back in the days, I want to be able to play a game that would not tell me how many times I could go pee-pee in the waterbowl.\n\nThe three things I also absolutely hated in this game are: The grappling hook mechanic, the death conditions, and the bullet scarcity formula. When I first acquired the grappling hook, it was a complete nightmare for me. The swining momentum is just so bad that it makes swimming through a tub full of mayonaise seem that much easier. It took me seven tries before I could finally get the gist of it and finally not fall off and become the next cannibal's grand slam. Talking about falling and dying a horrible death, I never understood how the main character sometimes manages to die from a half-meter drop. Those areas obviously have absolutely nothing there, and if I were sliding, my momentum was just about enough to rub a gum off of my shoe, but yet, those spots still somehow manage to kill me. Perhaps messing up the sliding gave the main character so much emotional distress that he died of pure embarrassment.\n\nWithin any survival games, I am one of those players that tend to hoard anything that I can find and use as little of them as possible, this game was no exception, but what definitely has gotten to me was the fact that the game will attempt to, in any manner and time as physically possible, to keep your bullet count around one or two. Now, this may sound like an excellent mechanic, and I am the one who is whining about something mundane, but the fact that any time you kill a gun-wielding assailant with two or more bullets in your possession, the gun you get from them is always empty, really ticks me off. However, if some other baddie picks up the gun, he would start shooting up the place like a twelve year old kid playing Rookie Mode on Resident Evil 2. This is not a good mechanic, this only manages to show the player a huge sign written thusly, "You are in my pistol theme park, and you will never have more bullets than I want you to." Why bother doing the whole survival aspect when you are not letting me worry about using resources? Since I know for a fact that I will always get bullets somewhere for a necessary fight ahead of me.\n\nTalking about bullets and fights, the staticity and linearity is absolutely flabbergasting. You would think that despite not being the ultimate open world survival game, I Am Alive would still provide the fundementals of the genre, right?\nWrong.\nFor the majortiy, if not all, of the cases, there is only one way to climb to the destination, only one way to swing somewhere with the swing hook, and only one way to defeat foes. There are some hidden items here and there given out for looking a bit further, but would also usually mean wasting precious foodstuffs and dying; they might as well place big pieces of paper with, "I owe you, invalid upon death," all over it, as this was mentioned to be a trial and error game with limited tries.\nAs for its staticity, every event and item placement are always at exactly the same place, even with static events, you would at least expect non-static placements for loots, and hope that perhaps that one time when you recheck that mundane corner again, a flashing item surrounded by an white aura would appear, like a young kid hoping to find Narnia in their grandmother's wardrobe, only to find an abundent amount of mothballs located within.\n\nOh, and the save system sucks harder than an industrial grade vacuum cleaner.\n\nDespite so many factors, including the menu being complete and utter stinking fecal matter, that make this game so frustrating, I cannot get myself to hate this game.\n\nAll in all, I am just so very intrigued by the world, the environment, and the idea of this game.\nDespite the frustration I Am Alive makes me deal with, during the immersive moments of the game, when I truly looked, especially into the story and the world, this game makes me feel in awe, and delivers so many other emotional impacts, like a pyromaniac seeing a forest on fire for the first time (to which the aforementioned person may or may not have been the cause of).\nI realize that I am on my own in the broken world.\n\nI realize that this game is not be for everyone, hence I would not recommend this game.\nHowever, if you are willing to overlook the many flaws I have already pointed out, and the ones I may have forgotten about, go ahead and try it out, but I do not in any way guarentee a frustration-free playthrough.\n\nTL;DR:\nYou most likely will not like it, but if you are willing to look at the game in a different perspective, by all means, go for it.","August 8, 2014","false","6.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are hacks available, though. On the plus side, the game does not appear to have motion blur.\nThere are several issues with the game, such as the controls not remappable separately, but only as a group (e.g. "Drop/Draw Weapon"). And since "Fire" and "Run" are in the same group, that is really annoying.\nAnother issue (and ultimately the one that leads me to not recommending the game) is that the game streams in world data, and when it does that, it sometimes stops responding to mouse input. This can go away within moments, but on occasion it stays. As a result, your mouse cursor will be fixed to the centre of the screen, in menus as well as in Windows when tabbed out.

The fast paced tactical decisions in combat are difficult to get used to but rewarding when you beat them after about the fifth reload, assuming you don't mind retrys being a significant portion of your playtime. That said, the game uses a horrible retry system where you find the right to reload a save like a power up, and if you run out, it sends you to the begining of the level.  Had an amazing amount of potential, but appeared painfully unfinished. I tore through most of the game in four hours, then spent most of the next day looking forward to finishing it. When I did, there was only about 20 minutes of content left and I was left without closeure to the story and a lot of massive disappointment.    When the game ended it even presented me with a stat board full of trackings of things that were never even an option in the playthrough.\n\nThe game is clearly an abandoned project and in its current state is too short to be worth getting into.","February 23, 2014","false","5.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Your biggest enemies are the environment, the lack of resources and the other survivors.\nGetting places is hard. Roads are blocked and bridges are broken, and your climbing skills are the only thing keeping you alive. Problem is, you have a very limited amount of stamina that drains every time you climb or run, and when it's drained fully - you fall. As if that's not enough, dust storms make the air outside unbreathable, and when inside the fog your stamina will constantly drain until you die, or reach high ground.\nResources are very limited, and you will rarely have more than 2-3 bullets in your gun. You will often have none. Combat is not based on who shoots faster, but on psychology and bluffing. Raise your hands to let the enemy come near enough for a surprise attack, or aim your empty pistol at him and tell him to back off up to a cliff, then push him over.\nThis combat system makes you get very creative when fighting 5-6 enemies, since you probably wont have enough bullets to kill them all.\nSome survivors will only fight you if you get too close, and backing off will prevent a fight. Others will ask for your help, and you will have to choose wether or not to spare your very limited supplies.\nWith this combat system and the constant pressure of the draining stamina, this game keeps you stressed throughout it all. And as if that's not enough - you have a limited number of retries before having to restart from the beginning of the chapter!\n\nThe game is flawed, though:\nControls can be a bit clunky while climbing, sometimes resulting in a pointless death and waste of retry.\nIt's not always clear where to go, especially in heavy dust where you can't see ♥♥♥♥, and you might end up walking in circles trying to find the entrance to a building, and it can get quite frustrating.\nThe story is very lacking. You learn pracitcally nothing about what actually happened and the story just seems to stop rather than end when you finish the game.\nWhile the game is semi-openworld, you have little to no motivation to explore. Yeah, you might find other survivors or some food and water, but is it really worth running around in a dust storm for?\n\nOverall, this game is a solid 8/10 and I highly recommend playing it.","February 26, 2014","true","10.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The world has been struck by earthquakes and it's up to you, a survivor, to try and find your family.\n\nThe graphics are dark and moody; you can only see a few metres ahead which makes it difficult to differentiate friend from foe. It really adds to the tension. That, and the lack of bullets. You have to pick targets carefully, and even decide if you want to kill them. It's not always needed, you see, and you really need to preserve your ammo.\n\nThere are also other survivors to be found and they might need your help. It's up to you. Helping them will grant you a retry. So in the event that you are killed you'll be able to try it again.\nBesides killing and helping people you'll be climbing around like the PoP and AC games, which feels natural by now, and is cool.\n\nToo bad the game is a bit short; it will take most people around 4-6 hours to complete.\n\nYet another game that has to be experienced, people.\n\n[Rating: 81/100]","September 18, 2012","true","4.9"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","2"

You play as a survivor of the apocalypse searching the forgotten city to find your family. This game shows quite a realistic view of what it would be like in an apocalypse with it's dark atmosphere, having to scavenge for food, ammo and survivors. I Am Alive is very similar to The Last of Us in many ways as they are both post-apocalyptic survival games.\n\nThe combat in I Am Alive has a more strategic approach as you have to take in the amount of ammo and health you have, also whether the enemies have a gun or a machete or even armour. Also what was awesome was how you're able to use the environment to kill an enemy, e.g. Holding your gun out to an enemy who has only but a machete and forcing him to walk back into a fire or off a cliff.\n\nThe overall gameplay gives you more of a restricted feel as you can't explore a lot of the areas and a lot is just blocked off. One thing that got my frustrated a lot was the camera view. Not being able to kill the right enemies due to slight knock of your mouse can really be frustrating. Another thing I didn't like was the amount of climbing you have to do as it just got repetitive and became a hassle.\n\nThe game only took about 4-4.5 hours to complete and so in conclusion, yes I'd highly recommend this game if it's on sale and you enjoy survival horror and post-apocalyptic games.","September 2, 2014","true","6.3"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

I really liked the atmosphere, I thought the story was satisfying for a while but by the end I was left wanting just a little more, and I thought the environment was beautifully crafted. I do think this game could've used a little more color, though.\n\nThis isn't the best game around, but I like it. I think it's worth the price that it currently sells for. If you are in need of an interesting singleplayer game to play, try this one. I thought the "intimidation" feature where you can scare off enemies by just pointing a gun at them even if its not loaded was pretty cool and original. Climbing in this game can be fun. This game is really just full of unique features that you won't find in most other games of the post-apocalyptic survival category.\n\nOther notes: the graphics are just good; not excellent, not average, but just good. The sounds reinforce the game's atmosphere pretty well. The AI can be tough to deal with at times. The level design itself is a puzzle at times.\n\nAgain, if you are looking for an interesting post-apocalyptic singleplayer game to play, this could be the game for you. If you want something more action oriented or roleplay-ish, you might want to skip this one. This game gets a 7/10 from me.","October 31, 2014","true","15.2"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

More like I Am Alpha!\n\nBecause it's a clearly rushed product that's not very well optimized, is ugly, is short as hell and ends strangely and abruptly.\n\nIt's also one of the best B-games I've ever played.\n\nI Am Alive drops you into a world torn asunder by a cataclysmic event. You're just a guy looking for people from his past, trying to help those in need, and trying to survive in a harsh reality where everything's out to get you. Your main ability is climbing, and the climbing system of IAA is really well-done: it controls a lot like Uncharted or Tomb Raider, but with the addition of a Stamina system: the longer you climb, the more your bar depletes. If it gets to the end, you'll still be able to climb, but your maximum stamina capacity will slowly dwindle until you get to a resting spot. You can restore your max stamina with items, but it's a neat take on providing urgency to a system that's been used before.\n\nThe combat is the second tier of the game, and it's also exceptionally well-done: the game utilizes an Intimidation system, which allows you to bluff your opponents using an empty gun while you try to control fights to your favor. Sometimes they'll call your bluff, and you'll have to either shoot them or go for a machete kill; other times, you might want to approach hostiles unarmed, wait for one to get close, and then attack with your machete, surprising everyone and giving you the upper hand. Ammo is scarce, and you don't want to waste a bullet: chances are if you miss a shot, you're about to die. The guns feel good, and the fact that unarmored foes die in one hit is an absolutely incredible way of finally adding realistic gunplay, which makes every encounter memorable. If you come across guys with guns, you either need to be unarmed and hope they come to search you or shoot them first. You will probably die a few times before you get the hang of things, and enemies flanking you might surprise you.\nYou later get a bow, which leads to interesting combat encounters since arrows are recoverable and the bow is silent.\n\nThe story, largely, is told by victims you save and the few friendly people you encounter on your journey and is well-written. The dynamic you have with the first friendly character you meet is the best, leading you to develop an emotional attachment to them. It's not going to win any awards, but it certainly helps to keep you motivated.\n\nThe game's not without its flaws, however; the ending is rushed, unsatisfying, and leaves you with a lot of questions, and there are times when the checkpoint system can get very annoying. I played the game on Normal and it was pretty tough, but I never had to restart a chapter. There are segments where you wander aimlessly through the streets, hoping to find something climbable to either save you from the dust storms or lead you to the next destination. The game is also (not, in my eyes, a negative) very short (I clocked in at 4h059s) which could leave some people thinking they overpaid.\n\nI really liked my time within I Am Alive's world, and a fully-developed sequel or spin-off in the same world would be more than welcome.\n8/10 Bows and Bullets","January 10, 2013","true","8.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thwiplash/recommended/214250/","thwiplash","ThWiplash","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thwiplash/","350 products in account","Let's just start of by saying that I Am Alive is basically TLoU Lite (even though it came out much earlier). You're in a crapsack world, almost everyone is out to kill you, you take care of a little girl, go on platforming/climbing jaunts, and have a painfully limited supply of ammunition.\n\nWhere I Am Alive falls apart is the story. The skeleton of something that could be really good is in here, somewhere, and you catch glimpses of it during your (short) stay in Haventon. Unfortunately, the story is never quite brought to fruition. Protracted delays in development, budget cuts, and a final rushed release (as an XBLA release instead of a full retail) all likely contributed to what is IMO an unfinished game.\n\nThe game isn't bad per se, it just doesn't do anything particularly well. The platforming could definitely have been done better; the stamina system is interesting, but I found far too many regen items and pitons (which you can use to rest while climbing to regain stamina) to make it really worthwhile. In the end, the whole system seems like a hindrance to my enjoyment of the game, rather than a useful mechanic. Combat is fairly basic, and usually boils down to picking off the people with firearms first, and then pushing the others off of cliffs or stabbing them. The rush you get from your first few hold-ups fades pretty quickly when you realize that EVERY encounter is the same.\n\nI would (possibly) have excused all of this had the story been more fleshed out. The ending seems absolutely shoe-horned in after the team ran out of funding.\n\nI find it hard to recommend this game to anyone, given how poorly it ends.","February 20, 2014","false","8.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its reception was lukewarm--often characterized by extreme and vocal loathing; it's a modern Ubisoft title; Stanislas Mettra said some very stupid things that got a lot of equally stupid reactions; &c.\n\nIt feels like the budget title it is, so gameplay mechanics are stiff and it often feels like a poor man's Uncharted set in a poor man's McCarthy-obsessed-with-fetchquests copycat's creation when you're climbing outcrops or buildings or trains--whatever. I liked this. I did. It felt old school, and since the game was going for an old school, very difficult fight for survival, it seemed right.\n\nThe game's difficulty, I felt, was perfect. I never died, but I was always coming close. There's a genuine sense of desperation start to finish, not only from you but from every NPC, enemy or friend--except maybe those aggressive armored ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s introduced at the 2/3rds point. Weird, annoying inclusion. You might find yourself sympathizing with many baddies.\n\n"Stick-ups" surprisingly lack the feeling of repetition from poor AI; despite their frequency, I always found myself with that feeling of desperation again, trying as quickly as possible to spot the guns before being forced to act and save some asses.\n\nThe storyline is lacking and feels more like a prelude than anything (reminiscent of Hard Reset), but the atmosphere makes up for its inadequacies, ash and dust falling everywhere, choking the environment and its people--you--stressing that Road inspiration. (If I were to guess--and I really want to--I'd say The Event was an exaggerated eruption of one or more supervolcanoes.)\n\nI loved the feel of this game, and I'll definitely replay it, hoping for further, bigger-budget sequels all the way through.

I'm in the reviewing mood:)\n\nAnyway first up is 'I am Alive' where a series of mega 'quakes has pretty much ruined everything. And your task is to seek your wife and child in your now destroyed home city, in 3rd person. The story and acting are nothing special but passable so we'll move on from there.\nThe ruined city is well designed and looks as you would expect a city to look after a huge earthquake. It's bleak and dusty, and crumbly.. and as you can imagine you have to travel over and under it. At times having to scale whats left of huge skyscrapers which gives a great sense of height as you scramble from ledge to ledge. The setting and soundtrack give an excellent apocalypic feel. It feels bleak and depressing,\nIt plays ok, but the combat is a bit clumsy. But you get used to it. And not everyone wants to kill you. Whether you help them all depends on what you are willing to sacrifice. It's not as linear as it seems either.\n\nRecommended!","October 27, 2012","true","13.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The trailers and stills looked great. But this game doesn't play well on the PC. The frame rates are poor, the controls are not efficient.\n\nMost annoying: The game interferes constantly to tell you how to play the game. You can't go 3 minutes without being told what to do next. This happens even in the middle of combat - "do this combo now to execute a surprise melee strike", and stuff like that. Dreadful. And forced save points and system that makes you re-do the level from the beginning if you die too many times. I have no patience for this sort of faux-difficulty shenanigans.\n\nThe story seemed good, though. I liked the narrative style. This might be a case where it's best to turn the game down to the easiest setting, just to enjoy the story.\n\nIf this game looks good to you, I understand where you're coming from.

On the good side, the story can be interesting and it's a fresh change from zombie apocalypse. Confrontations can also sometimes feel rewarding if you outsmart a group. The problem is that these good parts are rare. While the game teaches you the basics of combat early on, it also defies these at times. Also, the ending was horribly underwhelming.\n\nConfrontations:\nThe game does a great job early on of showing you ways of dealing with multiple people and when you are underpowered (lacking ammunition for your gun) but it breaks many of the conventions established early on. For example, the enemy will rarely recognize the bow and arrow as a weapon and so, rather than stopping, they keep charging you. The enemy will also, after a while, charge you when you have a gun out (believing you have no bullets). This breaks the mechanic of shoving the enemy into fire or off cliffs since it takes so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ long to maneuver them into position while keeping your crosshairs on all the enemies. Another issue is enemy spawning. One particular sequence annoyed me to no end. You had to walk forward and get the attention of one group before a second group would open an impenetrable door and attack you from behind. You weren't allowed to sneak past one group or deal with them one at a time; you were forced to let them flank you.\n\nPuzzles:\nThe game has a lot of climbing and maneuvering puzzles. I actually think this is its best quality and wish the game consisted purely of these sorts of puzzles and left out the clunky combat. Your climbing time is restricted by your stamina, which decreases over time as you climb. The first problem with this is that your character is incredibly difficult to control while climbing. I routinely found myself shifting along edges when I was pressing down to slide down the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ pole I was clinging to! Secondly, climbing is introduced in one of the hardest climbing puzzles in the game. With no guide or direction, the player has to complete one of the longest and hardest to deduce climbing paths in the game.\n\nStory:\nThe story is pretty generic, but by the end I had some hope for it. We were saying goodbye to some main characters and the protagonist renewed his effort to reunite with his wife. And then the game ended. The game progressed to a state where, while not great, it was certainly improving. But instead of continuing the game, it just abuptly ends in a vague cutscene. I had only just gotten a second arrow for my bow.\n\nIn the end, this game seemed like it was trying to be a lot of things and failing at all of them. It was made by what appears to be a primarily Chinese team, so this may be their first entry into American games, but it felt very lacking in ways that cannot simply be excused by considering other cultures. Get this game if it's on super sale. If for nothing else, the guy who voices Adam Jensen in Deus Ex: HR plays a guy in a wheelchair here.

You play a man searching for his family after a catastrophe destroys a large American city. Survivors live amongst the ruins, and many of them are willing to kill over a bottle of water or a can of food. Other survivors may need your aid, and it's up to you if you want to help them or not.\n\nI Am Alive is something like a survival-horror game, even though it doesn't have traditional monsters. Combat sequences aren't that numerous, but they do require some planning since enemies usually outnumber you and bullets are very hard to come by. I Am Alive often puts you in situations where you're facing four armed enemies and you only have one bullet and your trusty machete. Combat in I Am Alive works but it's kind of clunky, with button prompts often appearing just a bit too late; It's manageable, but could have been better.\n\nNot everyone in I Am Alive will be hostile towards the player: there are numerous survivors who require assistance of some kind. While you can help these folks out by parting with precious supplies, you don't have to. Saving some people might involve taking someone else's life, but do you want to waste a precious bullet to save a stranger? It's up to you, and the game never judges your actions (or inactions). I Am Alive tries to subtly steer players down the virtuous path but if you want to keep all the goodies for yourself, you can.\n\nI Am Alive also has some platforming sequences where you have to scale crumbling skyscrapers while making sure your stamina doesn't run out. These parts can be tense, but they aren't very hard.\n\nAll these things combine to make I Am Alive a fairly engrossing experience. What the game really needed more of was some extra polish as it feels a bit cheap, with mediocre character models and animations. The graphics can be atmospheric, but Unreal Engine's "Sand Blasted" filter is horribly abused and makes nearly everything look the same after a while; fans of the color grey will love I Am Alive. Enemy artificial intelligence leaves something to be desired too, as baddies will  often cower when you point a gun at them only to instantly forget you had a gun when you lower the weapon, only to suddenly remember you have a firearm when the gun comes back up and quickly go back to pleading for their lives. This behaviour is comical, but it kills the tension in a lot of parts.\n\nI Am Alive's ending also needed some work. The cliffhanger conclusion feels really rushed, and it leaves a couple of major plot points unresolved. It's a very disappointing finish, with almost no payoff. It feels like there's a level missing.\n\nFlaws aside, I Am Alive still manages to be a pretty good game. Try it. You just might be pleasantly surprised.","December 18, 2013","true","11.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The depth and immersion of this game is unbelievable. There's no zombies. No irradiated monsters. Nothing like that. There's just people. And they act like people. Some just want to defend their home. Others want your stuff. The way you fight is fantastic as well. You fight with psychology, rather than your muscles. You'll almost always be outnumbered. You almost always won't have any ammo. Use your mind, surprise the bandits, and make them -think- that you have a bullet chambered in that pistol you're pointing at them. If you go in, gun up, you'll find yourself dead before you can even -try- and threaten them.\nOverall, you'll hardly ever see the ruined city you're in. You'll barely be able to see a few feet in any direction. But then you'll climb up and out of the dust, and the world will just open up before your eyes.\nOne downside though, is it can occasionally go a little funny with the controls. This is a game where at times, it's quite plain that it's a port. But the slight irking from having your character shimmy along a ledge to the right, rather than climbing further up a building, is quite easily forgiven once you take everything else into stock.\n\nI'd heartily recommend this game to anyone who is fond of the survivor Post-Apocalyptia genre, with a heavy emphasis on realism when it comes to combat and exploration.\n\n9.5/10","February 21, 2014","true","16.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The combat is weak, but it's an interesting spin on the usual mash-up of 'shooter' games.  You have to choose whether to run, shoot, stealth, or try to muscle out the fights.  Ammo is SO incredibly hard to find that it really makes you think about having a game plan before you just run in guns blazing.  But the combat is not why you play this game.  The environmental exploration, navigation, and stamina climbing are exhilirating.  Many times you're climbing hundreds of feet above the city streets, your stamina is inching closer to empty and you're putting forth max effort just to hang on before falling to your death.  That's where the game's strength appears.  The music and hud elements really get your heart pumping as you make quick decisions in this post-apocalyptic city.  Finally the element of helping various people around the city:  do you risk giving up your well-earned supplies to help out those around you in need, or will you need that when you're dangling hundreds of feet in the air and on your last breaths?

Once I got past the hotel I managed to down everything with one arrow, until I got to the pier and got a second arrow at which point I didn't need a gun and ended the game on a mountain of ammo, the pier mission was also incredibly short, if they thought having large battles with a bunch of enemies would provide difficulty or make it all seem longer then they were wrong.\n\nThe items were all but useless, I could've started up my own community and fed them for years by the end of the game I had that much crap.\n\nSaving people was... alright I guess, but having to trek the entire city to go back to someone you saw at the start of the game just before finishing the game to give them a tomato is taking the ♥♥♥♥.\n\nI hate the way they separate segments of a mission, and that I never got to see what those horrific and scary looking mutant-ish shadows were in the dust clouds.\n\nAnd the ending, my god the ending.

Which can be seen in various ways.\nLet's take this in parts.\n\n\nThe grahics of the game are nicely designed. The engine's abilities remind of 09s to 10s games. So it's not bad at all.\nThe environment is stanning IMO. You find yourself in a world that has ended. Nature's gone crazy.\nThere are asphyxiating sandstorms all over and the element of dust and fog is everywhere.\nThe dusty environment results into a vast way too back&white-ish area.\n\nBuildings, streets, inner environments too, they are all so dusty that you are actually staying in a literally desert colored city.\nThere are meny nice ideas on the table. Earthquakes, fallen aircrafts, meta-apocalyptic views, half fallen skyscrapers, also nice places to hide, some nice areas to visit.\nMy only one complainment from this part is that although my rig was enough to support the game,\ni had some rendering issues making my mouse view laggy without seeing the fps dropping (weird)\n\nGameplay\nI found the gameplay to be really really interesting, and actually the main reason I loved it.\nRealism. The whole time you are racing against the odds of running out of stamina.\nClimbing buildings with bare hands and walking through the sandstorm forces you to keep finding places to rest yoru stamina for some seconds or else you'll die.\nAlso you have to keep scavenging to find canned food, water bottles, meds and a few more stuff.\n\nIf played smart enough you won't have serious problems, though youw ill feel the challenge if it.\nAlso guns. realistic circumstances as well. You start with a handgun and you barelly find bullets around. Your average ammo cap is goign to be around 2 shots.\nMost of the time you will use the gun to bluff against bandits and looters.\nA machine is going to be your main weapon, and a bow with only one arrow which can be retreaved from yoru victims.\n\nAlso there's an unlockable shotgun when helping a survivor.\nThe game really gives you ideas of things that could had been implemented. I am forgiving because of teh age of the game.\nLots of elements could add to teh fun like more stealthy skills and attacks or using traps.\nThis could have been one of the best surival games ever for me.\n\nStory\nNow this is a dissapoiting part. Story is that you are just a guy surviving trying to find his wife and kid.\nThe plot is that you end up helping a woman and her daughter find their way to safety. and stuff.\nYour main missions are like 3 or 4. Nothing else.\nThe game was clearly cut off most of its material and concept. You can see that it's too incomplete.\n\nAverage\nThis is a pure example of taking a super awesome creation, and ♥♥♥♥ing its brains out due to producer lack of founding.\nThe game could have been one of the most awesome titles of its kind, and it ended up being short, lacking story, and probably cut off most of its original elements ending up in a low priced easy to forget game.\nI feel really really sad for those who put teh efford to create the idea and start implementing it, at a time when meta-apocalyptic games were not even that mainstream at all, and then see their dream ending up as a scrap work put out for sale almost 10 ♥♥♥♥ing years later.\nI hope ubisoft decides to make a sequel or a prequel.\nBecause the base of this thing right here has potential to give a much greater than average future creation.","November 26, 2012","true","16.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Which can be seen in various ways.\nLet's take this in parts.\n\n\nThe grahics of the game are nicely designed. The engine's abilities remind of 09s to 10s games. So it's not bad at all.\nThe environment is stanning IMO. You find yourself in a world that has ended. Nature's gone crazy.\nThere are asphyxiating sandstorms all over and the element of dust and fog is everywhere.\nThe dusty environment results into a vast way too back&white-ish area.\n\nBuildings, streets, inner environments too, they are all so dusty that you are actually staying in a literally desert colored city.\nThere are meny nice ideas on the table. Earthquakes, fallen aircrafts, meta-apocalyptic views, half fallen skyscrapers, also nice places to hide, some nice areas to visit.\nMy only one complainment from this part is that although my rig was enough to support the game,\ni had some rendering issues making my mouse view laggy without seeing the fps dropping (weird)\n\nGameplay\nI found the gameplay to be really really interesting, and actually the main reason I loved it.\nRealism. The whole time you are racing against the odds of running out of stamina.\nClimbing buildings with bare hands and walking through the sandstorm forces you to keep finding places to rest yoru stamina for some seconds or else you'll die.\nAlso you have to keep scavenging to find canned food, water bottles, meds and a few more stuff.\n\nIf played smart enough you won't have serious problems, though youw ill feel the challenge if it.\nAlso guns. realistic circumstances as well. You start with a handgun and you barelly find bullets around. Your average ammo cap is goign to be around 2 shots.\nMost of the time you will use the gun to bluff against bandits and looters.\nA machine is going to be your main weapon, and a bow with only one arrow which can be retreaved from yoru victims.\n\nAlso there's an unlockable shotgun when helping a survivor.\nThe game really gives you ideas of things that could had been implemented. I am forgiving because of teh age of the game.\nLots of elements could add to teh fun like more stealthy skills and attacks or using traps.\nThis could have been one of the best surival games ever for me.\n\nStory\nNow this is a dissapoiting part. Story is that you are just a guy surviving trying to find his wife and kid.\nThe plot is that you end up helping a woman and her daughter find their way to safety. and stuff.\nYour main missions are like 3 or 4. Nothing else.\nThe game was clearly cut off most of its material and concept. You can see that it's too incomplete.\n\nAverage\nThis is a pure example of taking a super awesome creation, and ♥♥♥♥ing its brains out due to producer lack of founding.\nThe game could have been one of the most awesome titles of its kind, and it ended up being short, lacking story, and probably cut off most of its original elements ending up in a low priced easy to forget game.\nI feel really really sad for those who put teh efford to create the idea and start implementing it, at a time when meta-apocalyptic games were not even that mainstream at all, and then see their dream ending up as a scrap work put out for sale almost 10 ♥♥♥♥ing years later.\nI hope ubisoft decides to make a sequel or a prequel.\nBecause the base of this thing right here has potential to give a much greater than average future creation.","November 26, 2012","true","16.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I didn't know much what is game about because I got it as a gift from dear friend. But after a few minutes it become clear that this is not generic zombie game. It does have an apocalypse element and though clues are given about what coused it the emphasis of the story isn't on that.\n\nThe game nicely combines platform and a bit of puzzle elements with survive mode. You play as a very capable and  determent character who is out to find his family in a city that suffered cataststrophe a year ago. In the process you encounter other people, some friendly, some in need of your help and some that catastrophe drowe to crime and even canibalism.  You  are given some free  will and some of  your  actions will determin fate of others but all in all it is a pretty linear game that is focused on a protagonist story.\n\nGeneral problems with the game is its lenght which is way too short for a game of that price, lack of free will in full degree and some very annoying bugs.

It starts with the best premises: An immersive post-apochaliptyc atmosphere, a peculiar gameplay and a nice character story. BUT, it has an incorporated achievement system, so it doesen't use the Steam one. And that's a thing that i HATE. Because it makes achievements totally useless. The only reason of having an achievement system, it's to have them saved in your account, so you can then be satisfied and show them off. If you can't do that, they're useless. But that's the least. It doesen't investigate the catastrophe AT ALL. You don't know why, you don't know how.\nIt lasts 6 hours MAX, counting the eventual failures. And the end is... is frickin fast. What do i mean for fast? Well, from the last mission onwards i had that feeling, like the developers had a short-term to finish the game, so they finished fit quickly and poorly. The last mission is just an enormus exaggerate and unrealistic fight with tons of enemies and the finale, well...\nYou dead. Wanna know how? Wanna know why? lol, no, you dead. You just see your daughter (Or wife, i can't really remember) that found your camera, watches your videos and cries. And you?? Well, you dead, lol. ...So, the end isn't that great. No deep and too fast. And so much disappointing. That said, i can't really vote "NO" 'cause despite everything i enjoyed this little game a bit. Exluding the finale. The feeling i had, was of an hypothetical The Last Of Us, made quickly and on very low budget. If other than "YES" and "NO" there was a "A LITTLE BIT" option on the Steam reviews, i would pick that. But, for now, i feel forced to click "YES". (Sorry for my bad english)\n\n\nItaliano:\n\nParlare di questo gioco non è facile. Inizia con le migliori premesse: Atmosfera post apocalittica immersiva, gameplay particolare e storia carina. Poi però ha un sistema di achievement incorporato, non usa quello di Steam. Ed è una cosa che personalmente DETESTO, perché rende gli achievement totalmente inutili. L'unico motivo degli achievement è poterli avere salvati sull'account e poterli mettere in mostra, e non puoi. Ma questo è il minimo. Non approfondisce il perché della catastrofe, neanche un po'. Dura al massimo 6 ore e qualcosa contando fallimenti vari ed eventuali, e la fine è sbrigativa. Cosa intendo per sbrigativa? Dalla missione finale in poi si ha questa sensazione, come se gli sviluppatori avessero una scadenza corta e avessero buttato il finale a caso in fretta e furia. L'ultima missione è semplicemente un gigante combattimento esagerato agli estremi, dunque poco realistico, ed il finale, beh.. Muori. Ma non è che vedi il personaggio che muore eh, semplicemente una breve cutscene mostra tua figlia (O tua moglie, sinceraente non ricordo) che trova la tua videocamera e piange. Fine del gioco. Tu sei morto, e non hai riabbracciato tua figlia. Come sei morto non si sa. Ma sei morto. Molto poco profondo e molto sbrigativo. E molto deludente. Detto questo, non mi sento però di votare "NO" perché nonostante tutto come esperienza di gioco non è stata catastrofica, tutto sommato, finale a parte, il gioco non mi è dispiaciuto. La sensazione che ho avuto, è stata quella di un ipotetico The Last Of Us creato di fretta e a basso budget. Ecco, se oltre a "SI" e "NO" ci fosse l'opzione "FORSE" per le recensioni, utilizzerei quella. Ma fino a che non implementeranno un'opzione del genere, mi vedo costretto a premere "SI".","January 6, 2015","true","6.5"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","50","8","16","4","0"

I would like to mention a very symbolic start of the "cross the bridge" and then begins the real adventure. In fact, in the game there is no new-old-fashion zombies, there are only people, and these are the ones to be feared! I do not understand why people underestimate I Am Alive, because it is worth the money, genre component fulfills a 100%. I do not regret the money spent, but it is extremely frustrating that the studio Darkworks is closed."\n9/10 - Just Another Gamer","November 25, 2013","true","4.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There are two different sensitivities for when you're running in 3rd person and when you're simply walking. Only the second one can be changed, which results in the camera being utterly glitchy when you're running with high sensitivity options.\n\nWeird and annoying retry system that makes close to none sense when the game restarts you a second before you pick up another retry. Now, if you somehow still want to play this game, I'd suggest starting on easy. I went with survival and switched around 2h to easy simply cos of the game being made so poorly.\n\nCombat is.... it's something that made me rage internally at least a dozen times, even after switching to easy. It's this... I don't even... It's a mess. It tries to be realistic but fails so many times due to it feeling rushed and glitchy (as the whole game). At times you will kill 1 out of 3 guys and be left pointing your empty gun at 2 of them. Now if you don't have anything else and are forced to melee, you can already restart since if you want to kill one of the remaining two bad guys you will have to go into this QTE which resolves around you MASHING one button but since it takes around 3-5 secs to finish that, the last enemy will just rush to you and interrupt that leaving you basically dead. The only thing that you could do in this situation is spam "back off" till one of them is at the end of the map so he won't be able to interrupt you. Or somehow try to be stealthy (there's no stealth system btw) and pray to the RNG gods as well as the bugs gods. It's possible to do but in no way fun.\nAdd to that some delay when pulling gun at enemies - sometimes they'll still feel brave even though you can shoot them easily. The delay is usually around 2 secs and can result in your death most of the time.\nOh, and yes.. At some point the game introduces the "kill the though guy, rest will surrender" mechanic which worked... you've guessed it.. once. You will never do this because your priority will be to kill the guys with guns first and pick those up as fast as you can so that you don't have to waste more ammo on other enemies that will pick up said guns and be the threat again.\nTo finish the combat bit I will add that AI is just.. marvelous. In this one instance I SHOT 2 people but one of the enemies felt somewhat brave and went with the line close to "Can you even shoot? I bet you won't have the balls to.". Yeah...\n\nThe game doesn't feel fun in general. It's like a chore... I'd understand the game being difficult, but the game being difficult 'cos it's an unfinished piece of Ubicrap? Sorry, no.\n\nStory is.... uninteresting at best with the ending being a huge middle finger to your face and a cliffhanger saying "want to actually finish the game? Buy the next one." (which afaik will never get made). Not to mention that what you're doing has hardly any meaning for the main protag. The game is a pack of side quests resolved around other people and their problems. You're always helping someone, everyone else has 2 left hands and you're this knight on a white horse. Meh.\n\nNot a single interesting/likeable character. Protag is this shell of a character, stating the obvious for the most of the time and following commands of other people. The kid with the head that's 50% of her body in the first cutscene is your typical sick child needing rescue with 0 personality, same as her guardian and mother. Not to mention people you can rescue/help. I really wanted to shoot that starving woman who said she wouldn't touch the meat but wanted 2 cans of vegies out of me. For the record, there were 2 types of meat in the game - human meat and rat meat. Afaik she didn't state which one is a no-no for her so... yeah...\n\n"So, Extinox, have you enjoyed anything in this game?"\nActually yes. Not greatly but I still enjoyed it, I guess.\nClimbing was somewhat fun. Of course not at all times 'cos of well.. glitches but it was mediocre and thus better than the other parts of the game.\n\nEDIT: Oh, I forgot to add how it somehow uses 90% of my CPU most of the time and how sound is broken if you're running 5.1. The middle speaker will simply produce no sound. I will never forget the moment when there was a storm going on around me but when I set my camera to a specific angle, I wouldn't hear anything.","November 24, 2014","false","7.4"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","18","37","0","0"

I have a special liking for post-apocalyptic games, but if I had paid full price for this I would have been very upset.\n\nThe game starts off promising, with a bleak color scheme and appropriate moody music as you're placed in the shoes of a character who's arrived at his home town, and is trying to find a way to his dwelling. You have a gun but no bullets. OK, fine. Mad Max didn't have bullets for his gun half the time, but it was still an unforgettable experience of a movie. You come to a bridge which has been blown to pieces, and the tutorial system helpfully prompts you to jump the gap here, climb the post there. OK, fine. Normally I have little patience for jumping puzzles, but Half Life had its share, and that was one of the best games I ever played.\n\nAnd this is where the game betrays its console roots. And no, I'm not a PC purist. I own a PS2, and PS3, and a Wii. I grew up playing Nintendo. There are some wonderful console games out there. This is not one of them. Here is why: While climbling, you have a stamina meter. OK, fine. Realistic. No one can hang by their fingers indefinately. You have to climb smart, or you'll run out of energy and fall. But, the game doesn't merely expect you to use common sense. It presents a jumping/climbing puzzle that demands perfection. You have JUST ENOUGH energy to make it where you need to get to. If you waste ANY time, even so much as a tenth of a second, you're going to fail. And fail. And fail some more. After ten tries I was able to get close to my objective. After ten more tries I was able to begin a final reach to the sanctuary of a ledge. And that's as close as I got. After the seventh time of running out of energy and falling to my death within that final reach, I gave up. Any game that throws a puzzle like this at you, a puzzle where literally one tenth of a wasted second counts, at the very beginning of the game... Well, to quote Eric Cartman, "Screw you guys, I'm going home." Some players would view this as a challenge. More power to them. I view it as frustrating and as lazy game design.\n\nTo be fair, I'm not doing this game justice by reviewing it after only an hour of gameplay. But I say if the first bite of a sandwich contains excrement, you have no one else to blame if you take a second bite. Or, God forbid, finishing the entire thing just because you paid good money for it. And scanning other reviews has indicated that this opening puzzle of frustration is only the tip of the iceberg.\n\nThe funny thing is, I've spent far more time writing this review than such a game deserves. But if I save even one gamer from throwing away $15.00 on this, then my work is done here.","November 20, 2014","false","0.6"," 16 of 33 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","16","33","0","2"

I suppose the support for 5.1/7.1 surround sound was horribly done in the game, because any people that talked were always somewhere else than from where the sound was coming from.\n\n[3/10] Controls-wise, the controls are a little irritating, and for me, getting the camera to move at all was a challenge. I would be dragging my mouse across my entire desk just for the game to recognise that I wish to turn (no, it isnt the sensitivity, something is stopping the camera from moving). This may just be me, but it made it un-playable and ruined the game within the first 5 minutes.\n\n[1/10] Combat-wise, absolutely lazy. Ammo is extremely scarce, from what i've seen (and from other reviews), you constantly have only one bullet at your disposal. The only way to melee people is to get up-close and personal to them. while everyone is attempting stabbing you in the sides, you gotta walk up and press 'E' to attack. (I may be missing another form of combat/control, but trying over and over I couldn't find anything, correct me if I'm wrong).\n\n[6/10] Story-wise, somewhat enjoyable. Even though the start is a bit cheesy, the story seems to have more pontential than anything else in the game. While only an hour in, however, I can't say much about it.\n\n[3/10] Options-wise, there are almost no customization settings what-so-ever. In the video settings, you can change the brightness, the resolution, the aspect ratio, anti-aliasing, the graphic quality itself (low, medium, or high), FXAA, or VSync. This menu leaves you no room to really adjust the graphics for that 'high quality' look. The audio settings is just the volumes of main, music, voice, and sound effects. This doesn't bother me as much, but I was hoping for some options for surround-sound, coming from a semi-stealth game.\n\nOverall I would say this game is about a 4/10 from my view of it within an hour of game-time. I may be missing more good things or bad things about the game, but so far this game wasn't worth it.","November 5, 2014","false","1.3"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","15","31","0","0"

For three dollars, yeah it'd be worth it. For full price? No.\n\nIn short, it's very simplistic and feels very lazy. The characters are laughably simplistic with very little background ever established... which would really help given the main character seems to have the skillset of an Assassin from the Assassin's Creed franchise. I really would like to know how he's able to scale bridges and parkour on the level he does.\n\nFor a game about survival in a post-apocalyptic world there's very little actual survival and more on-rails walking engagement to engagement. You can't scavenge from the rubble, can't check inside containers or trash cans. This by itself hurts immersion.\n\nWhat totally kills the immersion is the fact that even the fights are puzzles. You have to kill certain enemies in certain ways and in a certain order or you're dead before you know it. Stranger still is the ability to carry just one bullet for your magazine-fed handgun. There's no simple melee, no way to counter someone running up on you and no way to grapple someone less than a foot away from you with a firearm.\n\nEven the animations are lazy. There's a scene wherein the main character is carrying a child on his back and ends up having to use his machete to break a chain. Our hero then sheaths this machete into the child's character model.\n\nIn conclusion? Boring, frustrating and not worth it. For a much better urban survival experience I'd reccomend the Fallout franchise.","November 6, 2014","false","1.0"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","1"

The gameplay is a mix of Resident Evil style scavenging and Prince of Persia-esque climbing sections.\n\nYour characters stamina bar plays a huge part in how you play this game. Most every action causes it to drain. Running, climbing, and struggling to break locks. When you enter the areas the NPC's refer to as "the fog", which is dust and ash in the air caused by storms your stamina constantly drains. Do you risk a few more moments searching dusty streets for vital resources, or climb back up to saftey and let it recharge? You will find yourself constantly watching it well into the later ares of this game.\n\nYou will come across other survivors and you must decide what to do. Some may be hostlie, some may need help, the intimatation combat is very well done in this game. You are actually able to hold hostiles at gunpoint even when you may not have any ammo. Don't wait too long to act or they may realize your gun is empty and attack.\n\nI am currently on my second playthrough of this one and still get the feelings I got when playing it the first time.  Fear, panic, sadness... all are present here throughout the entire game. You never feel overly powerful even after getting some of the better gadgets and weapons. The downside to this game is the rather low resolution textures.

Thing that is not always true in every survivals these days.\ncombat mecanics are repetitives, but what combats are not, right?\nDoes FPS allow you anything else than change your weapon or shoot at a different part of your adversaire's body?\nOur guy here have just a few and the difference and challenge when fighting a pack is to see who to shoot at first.

The soundtrack is stunning, the gameplay is innovative, and the atmosphere is remarkable.\n\nThat said, there are some problems with this game that do need to be addressed.\n\nFor one, there's a grainy filter that runs over the screen for the entire game. This isn't a glitch, but a purposeful design choice by the developers, presumably to make the game feel more gritty (or something). I don't quite understand the need for it, and it makes the game look pretty ugly.\n\nThere's also a stamina bar that slowly drains as you exert energy in the game, either by climbing buildings or traversing through the thick fog in the streets. When the bar gets about halfway down, the un-settling sound of shrieiking violins will fill your ears, indicating that your character doesn't have much longer to survive. This cranks the tension up to 11 during moments that might otherwise be a monotonous trudge, but by the 9th or 10th time it happens, you'll be looking for any excuse to avoid making your stamina drop. By the 50th time, you'll be taking off your headphones, setting them on your desk, and shaking your head in dissapointment. Sure, it's scary, and the sound sends chills up my spine, but there's no relief from it. That dreadful buzz will accompany nearly every moment of this game. It begins to feel like a cheap way to add horror into a game that really isn't that horrifying.\n\nOther than that, I Am Alive is captivating. The "intimidation" style combat feels excellent and believeable. Enemies will cower under your gun while you're pointing at them, but if you don't shoot for an extended period, they'll start to think you're bluffing, and they'll rush you. If you shoot while you're out of bullets, enemies will take note of it, and seize the oppurtunity to slice you with their machetes. It's a decently in-depth system for a downloadable title, and it makes you seriously consider each encounter carefully.\n\nOverall, I Am Alive is an impressive game. The story is simple, but well-told, and the character dialogue sounds natural. Shout-out to the voice actors as well, who do some amazing voiceovers for these characters. Their contribution to the game makes the world even more believable, and one that you'll want to get lost in.","November 10, 2014","true","6.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Yes its an xbox 360 port but with the new patch update and controller support, its quite beautiful in two ways. Graphically, yes its dated graphically but atmospherically it more than makes up for it. I personally really like the washed, sun bleached look. It all works brilliantly to be another character in itself. Bleak, dusty and desperate. You will stair in wonder at the sun glare and vista's through broken building windows, but despair about looking down to the dust soup below that you know you have to delve into.\nThe second positive is its combat is a really great attempt at different. You are taught to think about using the tools they give you with such an incredibly limited ammo supply, seriously limited. I have used the same one arrow for my bow in nearly every battle.\nThe added genius of a taunt option where you threaten with your pistol so that thugs back away at its sight and beg not be shot is great. However they will grow in confidence if you taunt to much and call your bluff realising that the gun is actually empty. Then they may attack, so will you machete, use the bow or run. You will die in this game, but each time it teaches you this is survival, so survive. It has a very standard but competent climbing and traversing mechanic which does its job well with good animation, although our hero does choose his own path occasionally.\nIf I have one gripe its that the save system is spread out quite a bit and when you have exhausted your in-between checkpoint tokens, gathered for saving civilians along the way, you will be sent back quite a way to a previous save point, and with this loose a lot progress that you may have made.\n\nThis game rewards exploration if you wish to risk it but with such intermitant saves points it also holds exploration back somewhat which is its only slight issue.\n\nFor a couple of pounds on steam, even if you pay a fiver i highly recommend this little gem. Think 'Shadow of the collosus' meets 'the last of us' and you are there.","November 18, 2014","true","8.8"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

It's atmospheric setting in a darker world that we all know, and a plot to keep us enticed until the end shows us a gripping; captivating; depressing; miserable; and almost always utterly brilliant game.\nThe crafty and clever use of a dust-filled city may make up for the graphics that have been questioned but I am quite comfortable with how they are regardless.\nAn interesting feature, which I would love to see more in games, is their use of the gun. We can stick people up. Literally, if you want something in this world you can point your gun in their face and watch as they cower. You can do the right thing and help people with supplies that are scarce, or rob them.\nDo not underestimate the scarcity of supplies because as I said before, it IS the most believable survival experience.\n\nI actually felt like I robbed them for getting this on sale :/\n\nEpic game and I am still looking for another game like it. 9/10","December 22, 2014","true","6.3"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

When going into abandoned buildings all you find is 2 food packs, 1 or 2 bullets and a note which IS related to the plot (there are absolutely NO subplots or side plots)\nSensitivity; the sensitivity was through the roof on this game for the mouse, I had my mouse set at its lowest setting and I had the in-game setting at its lowest but still moving my mouse an inch was a 360 BUT that can only be said for the x-axis, the y-axis on the other hand took my mouses HIGHEST setting to look fully up/down.\nIntimidating; you had well over 10 encounters with "bandits" but yet Ubisoft thought 3-4 voice commands will suffice.\nAttacks; when encounters with bandits happen you're held at gun point, dude with the gun walks up to you and starts pushing you backwards, QUICK TIME EVENT, you slash the dudes throat but there is no gore...disappointed. And although you have a combat knife you never think to use it in combat cos only real men fight with fists and empty guns.\nGeneral observation; the character has been designed with a role coil going round his chest but he never thinks to use it.\nJumping distances; constantly changing and always making no sense, there were more than 5 occasions when I thought I could make that jump, NOPE you need to climb this 100 foot tower, then go over the 30 foot connector and then along a 50 foot wire and back down a 100 foot tower to progress...... 10 metres.\n\nI'm not saying this is a bad game.... I'm just not saying it's a good game... because of it's 1 or 2 (million) faults","August 22, 2014","false","1.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

It was still a whole lot different than I imagined, but in a good way. Unfortunately you can definitely tell that this game wanted to be more than it is, as it is missing some stuff which would have made this game even better; but I'll get back to that.\n\nIt's a good game that shows us that Zombies aren't the threat in a post-apocalyptic world (not that there are zombies in this game) but that people are threat. In this game you might hear someone crying for help, but it could just be a trap set in place so they can rob you of well you're life. So you have to beware of who you help and don't help. Also since items are very scarce, you have to ask yourself if you want to help this person giving him/her your last health pack or do you keep it for yourself. These are great questions but to my dismay the choices you make don't really impact the game.\n\nIf you for example help someone, they usually just say thank you and you get an extra retry.  In fact the only reason to help someone in this game would be to get the achievement for helping all victims in the game. If however helping someone would impact the story line; for example the person you saved ends up helping you later in the game or perhaps you helped the wrong person, and that person later then screws you over in the story. Well I think you can imagine that would have made the choices in the game so much more interesting. Now theyre just NPCS that stare at you after you help them...well umm great.\n\nSo yeah theres a lot of potential for this game to be the best post-apocalyptic game ever but it unfortunately just misses the mark. I also feel like the fighting options are quite limited but maybe im just bad at the game. Either way I still found it a really enjoyabel game to play, and I do think I will replay the game again at some point just to save all the victims in the game. However the missed potential in this game stares at me with every NPC you save (they literally just stare at you). It's just such a shame no one has tried to improve on this concept because that would make the best post-apocalyptic game ever!!!\n\nIn conclusion, you should get this game! but feel free to wait for a steam sale. As long as you play 6 euros or less, it is worth it as you will definitely get 6 hours of gameplay; even from a rushed playthrough!","March 2, 2015","true","8.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The concept was very interesting and while it seemed to be an action game there were large psycological aspects to the play style that could make for a dynamic and unique game. After a long while I had forgotten about the game and assumed it to be vaporware only to suddenly find it alive on steam, no pun intended. I immediately seized it and excitedly dove right in. Disappointment set in quickly and I now wish it had stayed lost, maintaining my fantasy of what it might have been.\n\nI Am Alive is a post-apocalyptic survival game. Food, resources, and ammunition are scarce and people have devolved into animalistic cliques who follow a kill or be killed morality. You come in one year in the aftermath of a great earthquake which has destroyed your home town of Haverton. Looking for your wife and daughter you meet with Mei, a young girl who you connect with and decide to protect. My first qualm with this game comes with its flimsy plot line. The game immediately begins with a clear set goal in mind and then immediately falls off track and begins following a long series of tangents to a quite unfinished ending. Along this way you meet various crooks and characters of whom you only learn of three names leaving the rest as expendables with whom you make no connections. Rewards for helping these people are generally bland and unsatisfying despite considerable effort and padding in order to help them. Worse, while many could easily have something interesting to say or do, they rather instead go straight to a generic need item, recieve item, thank you formula. Enemies are just as bad, consisting of roughly 4 or five different character models and all resulting in the same action to solve the problem, kill the one with the gun first, kill the rest second. The game gives the appearance of giving options without presenting the other choices. There isn't really a diplomatic way to deal with enemies (ordering to surrender, bribing them to leave, tying them up), and if you're lucky after killing half of them, one may offer to let you knock him unconcious. My initial interest in this game came from the idea of having alot of ways to handle enemies and being given the choice between the easy way, murder, and the hard way diplomacy and mercy.\n\nItems are scarce in the game, but not very scarce apparently. There are some 20 different items in the game all performing some combination of the same three functions, restoring stamina, restoring strength, and restoring health. While a particular item may be scarce there seems to be no end the items to fill any one of these purposes. If you only have a single soda can you most likely have come across 6 or 7 water bottles, for example. Each of these items at some point can be used to help a victim solve a problem but it is frustrating when you do not have an item on your one chance meeting with a particular victim. In many cases its even more frustrating when an item serves no other real purpose but to help this victim, despite the item being readily available (cigarettes and wine). Along with this many of the victims seem to need this item only for the purpose of giving an item something to do (again cigarettes and wine). It again adds to the unfinished feeling the game gives.\n\nThe environment in the game is . . . well, gray. Exteremly gray in fact. I understand the idea of soot and ash covering the town making it this way but there is a serious lack of any color in this game indoors or out. I mean orange fire, yellow dust, red brick,  and blue water bottles should not be outside the realm of possibility. I originally thought that my character was severly injured and this was some sort of indicator of his deteriorated state, similar to other survival games, however that is the entire game. While the intent was clearly to give the player the feeling of depression washing over the city, it goes from sad to boring quickly. Action scenes feel drab and uninteresting when not only repetetive  but also made up of a single constant color throughout the short five hour playthrough. Did I mention short? Cause five hours was the entire game, padding and all. The core gameplay of I Am Alive could be broken down to one hour of actual play time and 4 hours of walking through dust cloud and climbing. While climbing mechanics in certain games such as Uncharted or Tomb Raider have been made exciting by quick time events, and active gameplay through the process, I Am Alive has made the sequence tedious. Adding the stamina bar would be an interesting twist on the game if it did not add to the padding between actual gameplay.\n\nOverall probably the biggest let down in game history, and that includes Duke Nukem. I hope the developers can sleep alright at night.","September 6, 2014","false","7.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Here's how the last encounter I had went when I finally nailed it after running low on the hard-to-come-by retries.\n\n\nI walk into an area and am surrounded, 2 guys behind me and 3 in front. I quickly note that 2 of the guys are armored (one being behind me), the second man behind me has a gun, and the other 2 simply have knives. I also notice a bonfire in the corner. Then I make my plan and execute.\n\nFirst I back up without revealing that I'm armed or willing to fight. However, the guy who approaches me is the armored guy who was behind me. Since he's armored, I can't kill him with a quick knife. So I continue backing up for a couple seconds until the only guy behind me is the one with a gun, and then I strike.\n\nI attack the gunman with my surprise strike, killing off the gunner and leaving the 4 others in front of me without a way to get between me to the dead man's gun. I then have to immediately toggle to precision aim, and aim quickly to shoot the armored man who was harassing me before he slashes me and while the other 3 enemies approach.\n\nOnce I shoot the first armored man pointblank, I can quickly cycle between the 2 unarmored men and convince them to start backing up, realizing that I have a gun with ammo. The 2nd armored man continues approaching with his bulletproof vest, so I have to quickly switch to precision aiming and shoot him in the head.\n\nAt this point there are 2 men with knives left. I tell them both to keep backing up, separating them and forcing one to back up to the fire. I then kick the poor man into the fire to die, and quickly turn as the final man starts sprinting at me when he realizes I'm still looking to kill. I choose to save the 1 round of ammunition that I have left, and catch him in a one-on-one knife battle, knowing that I can finally win it without his buddies around to save him.\n\n\nI walk away from 5 dead bodies with only 1 round of ammunition left, wondering how I can make it out of an even larger battle next time.\n\n\nI highly recommend this game. It has its flaws, but it's easy to look past them with combat as thrilling and intense as this.","August 16, 2014","true","9.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","3"

The only part I was a bit disappointed with has nothing to do with the game itself...I was hoping for an open world, non-linear approach to survival, where this game is one on rails where there's pretty much only one correct way to beat each "room." However, my expectation was never promised or even eluded to by them, and a small company can't really make an open world game to begin with.

If you do you will die. Not from world hazards, which are awesome, but from there not being enough things in the game to live off if you want to go for a jaunt in the dust and explore the world a little. Which is something you need to do TOO survive.\nYou are only guaranteed to find what you need by following the story.\nThe grey mono colour environment is a problem for me. It works well when you are actually out in the dust, its necessary and a unique hazard in games. My problem with it is the colour scheme continues when you are not even out in the dust.\nThe Game play is a little cluncky but I can forgive it for that. It makes the otherwise rail-road movement system a little bit more challenging.\nThe story is an interesting point to think about. Those who have read my other reviews know that it is the driving force behind my game purchases, It HAS a story but you are not following it because you want to you are following it because you HAVE too. It is the only way to find the resources you need to get through the game.\nCombat is ingenious and original. You have to make a decision about every bullet you use and every fight you get into. The problem is you lack the ability to swing your machete... Yeah I know how that sounds but think about it for a moment. You cant shoot your way out since you will never have more than 4 bullets in your gun, you will never have more than 5 arrows for your bow but it takes too long to draw making it unusable in close combat. The machete can only be used in combat when you are struggling with an opponent. You cant do that if there is more than one enemy because you will get ganked from behind by your opponents mate. The only bonus is you can pick up arrows after you have shot them if you can find them again! My advice on that one is DO NOT MISS!\n\nI give this game a 5/12\nStory: Awesome premise but..

It’s sort of a survival game set in a post-apocalyptic United States of America. You play as some guy with a forgettable name after he has walked across the entirety of the United States after “the Event” to find your wife and daughter. I remember when the demo came out and I tried it having mixed feelings about it. You can tell that Ubisoft really wanted to show off the climbing engine they use for Assassin’s Creed in other venues. Unlike Assassin’s Creed where you can use your free running to get around the city in a number of different ways I Am Alive simply has you going on one set path. The climbing and exploration is done well in I Am Alive, the stamina bar was a nice touch. You can only run or climb until you run out of stamina and after that you have to mash the right trigger which will deplete how much stamina you can recover, if not you’ll end up falling to your death. And if that sounds like too daunting of a challenge fear not! You can scavenge different supplies as you make your way through the city like food, water, and medical supplies. So if you’re running out of stamina you can just drink a bottle of water as you’re climbing and you’ll be alright.\n\nCombat is the other major obstacle that you’ll encounter and it wasn’t done as well as I expected. You start off the game with empty pistol and some enemies you intimidate and some you have to kill but it always seems to be random chance. You’ll run into other enemies with guns and even though bullets are really hard to come by and it would seem that you can’t have any more than four bullets in your gun your enemies will have full magazines and extra clips. Combat is messy and I always dreaded walking into a conflict but perhaps that is what the developers were aiming for, trying to drive home how hard it is to survive in a post-apocalyptic world.\n\nI came into I Am Alive being on the fence about it. The demo left a bittersweet taste in my mouth and the entire game isn’t very long at all. The game ended right when things were getting good and I left with more questions than when I began. There are other NPC survivors that you can help by getting them certain resources in exchange for information about your family and maybe doing that would have given a better story ending, I’m not sure I don’t usually strive for 100% completion when I struggle with a core mechanic of gameplay , like combat. I think I Am Alive would work really well as an episodic game with what is already released being the first episode. I thought that they were working with an interesting premise which I wouldn’t mind seeing a little more of once it’s been fine-tuned and had some of the bugs worked out of it.\n","February 25, 2014","false","6.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has a nice post-apocalyptic feel, and the grainy "cam" effect is a nice touch.\n- Sound: Not a big sound guy, but nothing to complain about here. The sound feels right for this type of game.\n- Music: Again, not a big game music guy, but the music works.\n- Controls: The controls feel solid and responsive, for the little bit I've been able to play/tolerate the game. Which leads me to...\n\nThe Bad:\n- GRAPHICS!!!!!!!: Honestly, the game doesn't look bad. That's not the problem here. The problem is the graphics are so #$%^ing glitchy, fractured, and spotty that the game is almost entirely unplayable. Certainly a great many people haven't had problems, but I've found a great many people who have! Walls, floors, objects, textures, lighting... you name it, all these things randomly seem to disappear and reappear on my system. I have gone over multiple suggested methods on how to fix the graphics in "I Am Alive", and none of them have worked. The only one I haven't tried is going back to an older version of my NVidia drivers. If you have to install old drivers for this game to work, the developers (UBISOFT) didn't make a very solid title, nor do they give two squirts of ♥♥♥♥ about fixing this broken game.\n\nIf the graphics actually WORKED for me, I would probably be recommending this title. Unfortunately, they do not. They make me want to slap the developers in the face with a crowbar until they are unrecognizeable as human.\n\nYou may have better luck than I. Purchase at your own risk. If you suspect, even for a moment, that you may find yourself pulling your hair out trying to fix the graphics on this game, I recommend you don't pay more than $5 for this title.\n\nTHE INFORMATION HEREAFTER HAS BEEN ADDED, AFTER THE GAME BECAME PLAYABLE\n\nI recently upgraded my graphics card from an older GTX 275 to a shiny new GTX 970. Please note, I did not change my view of this game from negative to positive. It makes me a little sad. So, here goes:\n\nThe Good:\n- Nothing to add to my previous review information. Sadly, the game did not get better once I was able to play it. Instead, I was able to play it and see more bad.\n\nThe Bad:\n- THE GRAPHICS!!!! Yes, I know I posted that complaint before, but now it's for an entirely different reason. It could be that my new video card is just TOO GOOD for this game, but now that I can actually see and play the game, it looks like garbage! What I thought was cool, atmospheric effects before has since been revealed to be an attempt at distracting you from lazy, sloppy game design. The models are clunky. The environments are bland. The actual object textures are not good in the least.\n- Pathing: I get not wanting the player to explore certain areas, but they should block those areas off better. I find myself constantly scratching my head as to why some of the minor obstacles in this game are insurmountable for the protagonist. This guy does plenty of acrobatic stunts when the game wants him to, but none of that pertains to those times when he's on flat ground with no risk of death looming over his head (or below his feet).\n- Stamina: I get that this is supposed to be a tough, survival type game, but our protagonist has no stamina whatsoever. It's quite annoying.\n- Combat: This has got to be the most counter-intuitive version of combat the studio could have possibly concocted. Some of it is fun, like being able to bluff enemies with an empty gun, but some of it makes no sense, like how you can't pull out your machete unless you're about to engage in combat, and it's basically worthless in a real fight.\n- Ammuntion: I get that it's scarce. That makes sense. But I hate when a game makes ammo extremely scarce and rare, but enemies have an endless supply (or at least, in theory). And if they do have a seemingly endless supply, when you finally kill them, they must have just shot their last bullet! They never drop but maybe one or two bullets. What the heck!?\n\nOverall, I feel this game had lots of potential, but just fell short in too many areas. It may be a fun game for some, and to those who enjoy it, more power to you. For me, however, I believe I've played all I'm ever going to of this game. I will not finish it.","January 2, 2015","false","3.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has taken you a year to get back to your town and you are now trying to find your wife and child. On your quest to do this, you become connected with another family and you complete missions for them.\n\nThe game is brutally hard even when not on the hardest difficulty. You have scare resources and you have a stamina meter that prevents you from climbing or running forever. Also, saving the game only happens at random, spread-out times that are not controlled by the gamer. I imagine this is one of the main reason the game got beat up by critics.\n\nOverall, I loved it even though it was completely bleak.","November 26, 2014","false","10.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's one of those games that I play, and don't really enjoy, but want to keep playing. I mean, The game is very ambitious, and I'm having some amount of fun with it, but there's just some things about it that you can't help but think how this game may have benefited from some different design choices.\n\nI enjoy the challenge that the limited continues provide.  It makes you want to play the game more carefully. I feel like the game rewards you for exploring, as you find additional items, and sometimes survivors to help, which will give you an additional retry, but it also punishes you by making your stamina go down, making you almost not want to explore.\n\nIt's little things like that where the game is sending you mixed messages where it starts to feel like a chore to play. Yet, then I end up raiding an area with a whole bunch of enemies, and I have to carefully pick & choose my next move, trying to make people surrender, or pushing them far enough back to kick them off a ledge, or getting close enough to stab them with my machette. all the while, I'm making sure I do them all in the right order and quick enough in order to avoid getting hit, and conserving my ammo, which is very precious.  Some might find this tedious and complicated, but I find it tense & exhilirating.\n\nAfter you get through an area, just fighting group after group of guys, the game just makes you feel like this awesome Mad Max kind of character, and it's those moments, and the story (which is somewhat basic but kind of intriguing) that keeps me coming back to it.\n\nThe game is definitely not for everyone, and it has it's flaws... but for people who enjoys survival horror games, or just games with interesting systems and mechanics, I'd say to definitely check it out.","December 29, 2012","true","5.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

When first conceived, it was purposed to be set in an explorable, expansive, post-apocalyptic world with deep gameplay mechanics focused on human interaction in times of crises. But two years after its ambitious beginnings, the original developers, Darkworks, handed the project off to Ubisoft Shanghai. In its new home, I Am Alive was rebuilt as an arcade title with many of its intended features either removed or condensed. So how does it fare in its current state?\n\nI had not heard much about I Am Alive prior to release, but if its original narrative was anything like the final product, then the idea probably was not very good to begin with. The game takes place a year after America is struck by a massive earthquake known as “The Event.” You play as an unnamed survivor, separated from and in search of his family—at least, that is how the story begins. The plot makes a sudden shift early in the game and becomes centered on the protagonist helping reunite someone else’s family for the remainder of the campaign. By the time we reach the end credits, our protagonist’s personal mission has made almost no progress. Some may find this hugely unsatisfying, though I suppose in some ways, it is poetic and fitting to such a morbid game.\n\nWhile I Am Alive’s narrative is devoid of creativity, its gameplay mechanics fortunately are not. Being aware of your surrounding is pivotal to survival. “The Event” has left much of America uninhabitable, filling the atmosphere with ash and dust, and to escape the hazardous environment, you must scale structures high enough to reach fresh air. This process eventually loses its novelty after the first few times, but it deters players from rushing and encourages exploration. But the most innovate idea I Am Alive offers is the idea to threaten and bluff. I say “idea” because its implementation is just deeply, deeply flawed. During confrontations, you may raise your pistol, loaded or not, to halt enemies in their tracks. At this point, the ability to negotiate would have been a hugely welcomed feature, but alas, the system never gets deeper. The moment you look away, your enemies will attack, rendering threats extremely useless since you are forced to kill regardless.\n\nI Am Alive’s single redeeming element is its atmosphere, which captures all the greatest facets of survival horror. The thick dust at ground level obscures vision beyond a few feet from your character. The element of surprise comes from not knowing who or what you will run into until it is too late. Ammo is extremely scarce, and your character is fragile, so knowing when to flee or fight becomes essential. Dying NPCs taking refuge throughout the city convey a genuine sense of desperation and futility. This is survival horror done right.\n\nAtmosphere and missed ideas aside, nothing else about I Am Alive is very memorable. The graphics are bland, the soundtrack forgettable, and the animations clunky at best. There are side quests, but those are far and few in between. Remnants of Darkworks’ original ideas are still apparent in the final product, but all of them marred by poor execution. I sincerely hope that Darkworks’ vision will resurface one day, refined and in all its entirety.

When you first boot up the game you may think the developers are aiming for a monochrome art style to reflect the emptiness of the world and the protagonist. Nope - it's just really, really dusty. Everything (seriously, everything) in the game is black, white, brown, or somewhere in between, with occasional splashes of red (to create an industrial feel as well as the obvious reason).\nFollow the exploits of Professor Brian Cox as he tries to find his family, help fellow survivors, and explain the Pauli exclusion principle to increasingly ignorant and hostile thugs. At times, this is deep, rewarding, and engaging stuff.\nUnfortunately for the Professor, his resources are somewhat limited. Our Lancastrian hero's weaponry is limited to his machete and a pistol. However, the latter seems to be used more as a mechanic for conserving resources than as a weapon, as bullets can only be found from enemies who have...guns! Combat can therefore become frustrating as confrontations with thugs are common and it's difficult to know who to shoot first and who to leave for a struggle kill with your machete.\nThis isn't the only time tactics are needed for conserving resources, however, as Professor Cox regains health and stamina through the rare packets of food and drink that he finds perched on outcrops and crates by a fellow survivor who presumably didn't want to make things to easy for those after him.\nThe game revolves around stamina and climbing as Professor Brian must scale increasingly dizzying heights during each episode. Despite his PhD in physics, the Professor's stamina depletes frighteningly quickly making each section of climbing a nail-biting game of tactics. Thankfully, as seen above, Brian can have snacks while hanging from girders to give him a boost. How this is meant to work in real life exactly I have no idea.\nSo what happens when the Professor falls to his death, or some thugs grow tired of hearing about eleven-dimensional M-theory and slaughter him with machetes? Well, on "Normal" mode he'll be given three retries for each "episode" which will allow him to revert to a checkpoint a few minutes of gameplay back. It soon becomes apparent, however, that given the maze-like webs of scaffolding Professor Cox must negotiate and how difficult is to know which enemies to eliminate first on so few bullets, these retries really aren't enough. It's not uncommon to have to retry up to twenty minutes of gameplay following a clumsy death near the end of one "episode". The game only saves at the end of each 20-30 minute episode, so get ready to sit down for long periods at a time with this game.\nAlthough we're used to Brian gazing dreamily up at the stars as though he wouldn't hurt a fly, the game's moral direction is altogether more ambiguous. You're rewarded for helping injured survivors and reuniting friends and family, but more frequently you're forced into combat you don't want or need. I would have liked to have seen a less linear path through levels, with some scope for stealth and avoiding conflict.\nWhen the game works, it works well and flows nicely. Although some of the events in the game feel jarringly too convenient (early on an earthquake pushes over a building, allowing you to slide down the wall back to where you started form and the next checkpoint), a dark atmosphere draws you in and it's hard to resist helping Professor Brian back to the university in time for his next lecture on electron potential wells.","March 28, 2013","true","8.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Massacyre/recommended/214250/","Massacyre","Massacyre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Massacyre/","165 products in account","This game. It's...well it's different. If you like survival games then you should enjoy the bleak atmosphere and setting, but as the levels aren't massively open world, looking for supplies only requires you to take the less obvious route to your goal.\n\nGunplay (and later on, arrow play) requires thinking and timing, as you only have 1 bullet vs 4 enemies at many points in the game. Again this adds a survival aspect to the game. If you are a fan of bleak miserable stories, then also conisder buying this game. It is one of the few arcade games that actually has a decent story.\n\nThe thing this game is probably most well known for, and hated for, is the retry system. You pick up "retries" through the game by helping people, (by giving them your supplies) or just finding them lying about. Retries basically let you start from last saved checkpoint. Out of retries? Then you will have to start that level that you have been playing for an hour all over again. It's quite similar to Dead Space 2's Hardcore mode, where you only get a few saves (albeit not as harsh).\n\nThe last gameplay element I will look over is the most important, and may influence you buying it. The stamina bar. The stamina bar is used up for almost anything except walking. It regenerates very quickly but only when walking. If you are halfway up a building, you can't just stop and rest, you either use up precious supplies, or die. When your stamina bar is empty you enter a mode called "extreme effort" which lets you push on through whatever you are doing (climbing, walking through dust clouds etc.) but then actually drains the capacity of your bar, which means less stamina regenerates each time you rest. This therefore, means climing is more supply dependant, unless you refill your bar to full capacity. For people who tend to not think things through before doing something, this game will not be for you. Unless you don't mind starting a level over every time you die.\n\nI played the game on the hardest difficulty from the outset and have only died 5 times between level 1 and 11, so it is easily done.\n\nIn conclusion, this game I recommend on sale, as it only lasts about 5 hours but the story and satisfaction of surviving will make sure you do not regret the price.\n\nStory: 8/10 Graphics: 6/10 Gameplay: 8/10\n\nI give it overall, a solid 8/10.","January 31, 2013","true","6.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It turned out it was actually the software for my gamepad that was causing problems. I completely uninstalled it, and reinstalled it. After that, this game was a lot of fun. To those complaining about the gray colors, you're in a crumbling city with volcanic ash blowing in constantly. Naturally it's going to have some discolored elements to it. I think this is what gives the game it's visual appeal.\n\nAfter fixing the problem with my gamepad, I no longer have any issues with this title.

You can practically taste the bleak, hostile and claustrophobic post-apocalyptic world. Climbing mechanics that are closer to Prince of Persia than Assassin's Creed, and add further tension and intensity with a Stamina meter and the chance of a lethal drop every few steps. The survival aspect is well-done, with exploration being about equally likely to lead to more of the sparse number of much-needed inventory items, as to another potentially deadly confrontation. Largely captures the grey moral nature of the post-apocalyptic world, like the movie The Road; no one can trust one another, and someone pointing a gun at you and/or threatening you may not be looking to kill and/or rob you, they may just be scared. Challenging. Once you've slid down a slanted skyscraper, jumped the gap in a modern bridge or barely made your way through a collapsed building, you will never again feel completely comfortable in our otherwise seemingly strong, sturdy buildings.\n\nCons: Unless you're playing on Easy, the Retry feature is pretty ridiculous: you have to complete a level without running out of them(in spite of the trial-and-error nature of much of the game), meaning without making very many mistakes(you can earn extra Retries), or you have to start it all over - and trust me, in this, you will make mistakes. Once you've completed a level, you can do it over, but if you go back to a level before your current one, it will delete your progress beyond that level(forget about replayability)! If these aspects were something hardcore gamers could activate to challenge themselves, that would be fine, but with it being the way the game is designed, it loses a lot of potential fans. Ending is unsatisfying. The last third of the game is prepostorous - it's as if it was developed by someone else, and they thought it was a regular shooter, rather than a "make every last bullet count" survival game.\n\nMy recommendation: Give it a go if you love at least one of the following: Prince of Persia style climbing, a survival challenge, dark post-apocalyptic fiction and unconventional approaches to taking out enemies.","December 30, 2013","true","7.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The main character is a hero in a decidedly non-heroic world.  Gameplay alternates between climbing/exploration and combat.\n\nClimbing/exploration is tomb-raider like, although a little more on-rails in that if the game doesn't want you jumping, you won't be able to jump.  The second difference is a stamina meter which drops the longer your are climbing.  If it depletes, you fall to your death.  I liked this approach, although the "scary" music that starts playing when you are at 75% or lower stamina starts to get irritating.  I enjoyed the climbing aspect of the game, once I got used to the mechanics of it.  There is a fair amount of backtracking, though.\n\nCombat is not the game's strength.  Since there is limited weaponry, you have to intimidate your enemies and push them off ledges, into fires, that sort of thing.  The idea is interesting, but the execution really didn't work well.  Some enemies don't back off.  Some enemies start shooting right away.  The only way to know which is which is to die and restart.  Until you get the bow-and-arrow half way through, this mechanic gets quite frustrating.\n\nI finished the game in about 6 hours.  That's pretty short, but I bought it on sale and feel like I got good value for the money.  Despite it's weaknesses, I found the game as a whole compelling.  I was invested in the world and the characters.  The story of a man who, having lost his own family, decides to risk his life to safe someone else's is a common trope, but very well done here.  Some levels, like the ship or climbing the second office building, were a lot of fun.  On sale, I recommend this game to fans of the Tomb Raider genre.\n","November 23, 2014","true","11.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Where do I even start...\n\nBad controls. For example, you run using a left mouse button! The left mouse button! Yes, you can change key bindings but the same button is used for shooting, so you either have both running and shooting on LMB or none of them.\nAnd this is even better: You can jump and climb only on specific spots where the developer allowed you to. Forget basic logic - you can climb this truck but not the same truck over there. You can grab this ledge but not that one. This turns the game into a guessing game. Guess where's the path the level designed made for you, because you can't go anywhere else!\n\nThe savepoint system. There is only one hard savepoint at the beginning of each chapter. So if you leave the game too soon or the game crashes (happened multiple times to me), be prepared to replay last 20-30 minutes.\nThere are also more soft checkpoints that you can use to spawn after death but the devs had another great idea - let's severely limit the number of respawns and if you spend them all, replay the whole chapter! Isn't it a great idea in a trial&error game where you can hardly predict or plan anything during your first playthrough? Splendid! Thankfully, the easy mode has unlimited respawns.\nThe savepoint system has one other major catch. It also your saves your stamina capacity, health and ammo. And this brings the last "tiny" problem with...\n\nThe stamina system. This is the thing that made me quit the game for good. I'm fine with a stamina bar that you need to recharge by resting a bit. But here, if you spend all stamina points (which is often unavoidable in this game) you maximum stamina capacity starts to decrease. And the capacity doesn't recover by itself, you need to use very rare consumables to get the full stamina back.\nSo it's pretty easy to end up on a savepoint with only 20 % stamina bar, no consumables, and a long climbing sequence or a dust storm ahead. At this point your're done because it's impossible to continue, you die or fall almost immediately. Restarting the checkpoint doesn't help because it doesn't restore the stamina bar. And in my case the checkpoint was also a chapter savepoint so restarting the last chapter didn't help either. My only choices were either to restart the previous chapter and replay everything again (risking the same problem in the end), or to delete this piece of ♥♥♥♥ from my computer.\nI chose the latter.","April 25","false","3.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

While there were a number of excellent city views in this game, a lot of my time also seemed to be spent with so much lens flare I could hardly see or with such an aggressive grain filter that it felt like I needed cataract surgery.  There were some interesting gameplay elements that became somewhat repetitive, but I felt like none of them ever really shined.  The exploration is fairly minimal, the plot is generic and never feels like it's really resolved, the survival aspect is somewhat tame.

Unless you enjoy excessively long and redundant climbing puzzles that are incredibly slow and boring, this game is not for you. Combat usually consists of... 1) See enemy. 2) Shoot enemy with gun. 3) engage in quick time event to kill the other enemies, mashing the same button over and over, hoping one of the other enemies doesn't decide they want to attack you while you are stuck in a QTE (Quick time event). ALL combat aside from firearms and sneak kills are QTEs.The exploration might be fun, if not for the blurred graphics to try to make it look better. The textures didn't look nice, so they just blurred everything. Oh yeah, the game has next to no color, so everything looks pretty similar. Movement is really clunky and the climbing is obnoxiously slow and unneccesary. Oh yeah, if you are having trouble with a section, the game will make it harder by lowering your max stamina. So in an exploration game, they discourage exploring while climbing so you don't get an obnoxious lessened max stamina, make everything look incredibly boring, and make the occasional encounter pretty underwhelming too. Ever get that feeling where you get an objective in a game and it becomes and irritation and a chore? That's basically this entire game. (Most of the exploration I found was just someone telling you to backtrack to somewhere you have already been. /:) I was incredibly disapointed by this game.","September 22, 2014","false","1.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBalmyScholar/recommended/214250/","TheBalmyScholar","TheBalmyScholar","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBalmyScholar/","98 products in account","Before buying this game, I read the reviews like any normal person would. I found alot of people saying they hated the game. I did find quite a few positive reviews though and so I decided to go for it anyways. ( I think I only paid a few bucks for it during some sale )\n\n+ What I like:\n\n-Climbing/Stamina System\nI love the climbing aspects of this game. I have to sit and carefully plan out my ascent or descent based on how much stamina I have at my disposal. Instead of blindly climbing like in Assasain's Creed, I have to think before I climb. This is the most realistic climbing I have ever seen in a game (in terms of stamina), and I love it so much.\n\n-Fighting\nThe fact that you can intimidate the enemy without any bullets and shove them down a hole is an A+ in my book! Seriously though, this game seems to have a similar theme, "Think before you act". I have found myself analyzing the enemy and finding who to kill first and how to do it. The intimidation that you can produce with an unloaded gun is spectacular and I find myself using it often.\n\n-Scenery\nThis game really sells the post-apocalyptic setting and between the dastardly ambushes and the unsettling music I find myslef on the edge of my seat.\n\n+ What I dislike\n\nHonestly there really is not that much I truely dislike about this game. The limited retry is a bit troubling, but it forces me to take my time and analyze every situation. The fighting system is a little tough to get at first but once you get the hang of it, its not too bad.\n\n+ My Thoughts\n\nI do indeed recommend this game. I would probably not have bought it if it had not been on sale, and I don't recommend paying $15 for it. If this game does end up going on sale then I recommend getting it, as you will most likely enjoy it as I have.\nThe trick to this game is to have patience and not rush into things. If you try to play this game like an FPS game, you will not enjoy it. This game is all about conserving the small pile of resources you have while trying to stay alive. It's a refreashing change from the FPS games I usually play.\n\nThanks for reading my review,\nTheBalmyScholar","February 6, 2015","true","2.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The only major problem, is the combat is incredibly clunky if you just run into it. That's why you need to plan everything out.\nAnd the situations when you stand off against three guys and you have one round in the chamber are tense as hell. At one point I'm pretty sure i actually yelled "Okay, now get back!" at one point. Quite an immersive experience.\nIt's got a system where you can help stranger in return for supplies (usually a respawn) and it is often not worth it, but it actually feels good to help sometimes.\nIf you like Assasin's creed, The Last of Us, or just a fun post-apocalyptic setting, you'd probably enjoy this game. 7/10","February 22, 2014","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The very things many people on here considered to be "flaws" actually made the game more interesting and enjoyable for me. The graphics are indeed bleak and gritty, but that added to the overall theme and mood of the game. The controls are unusual, but nothing you can't get used to. The game has suspenseful, nerve-wrecking dynamics - not as in "aw screw this BS, I quit", but as in "OMG, I'm going to die" and "YES, I made it, woohoo". Unlike other games, you don't have unlimited amount of stamina. Any physical effort, as well as being in polluted air, tires you out, and if you get too tired, you fall to your death, or suffocate. Unlike other games you don't have an obscene amount of ammo. Often you don't have any ammo at all and end up having to play head games with the bad guys. That's what truly makes this game unique.\n\nThere are some things that could be improved. The map is virtually useless. Quests are not tracked or even marked, so if you meet someone who needs help and can't help them at the time, good luck trying to find them later. The game it also painfully short with a painfully depressing ending. That said, I still enjoyed it very much. 8 out of 10.","January 18, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It was very suspensful and SUPER creepy. The layout and mapping system reminded me of Silent Hill Downpour, but the movement was a little like Assasians Creed. You are able to climb up skyscrapers, sparta kick people into firepits, use a crossbow, and much much more. Although, it was a little confusing on where you should go sometimes it was still pretty awesome. It was a shorter game, but there are some achievements that you can get.\n\nThe storyline was a little off. I wish that it showed more of him trying to get to his family instead of helping anothers. It left off on a cliffhanger, and I'm not too fond of it. Also, the checkpoints were your saving points. There is no place for you to save your game, becuase it automatically does so. That was probably the most annoying part of the game. (Besides the ridiculous solar contrasted rays of light in your eyes)\n\nAs for the items, there was always a supply of them. I never had any issues, except when climbing with the pitons. My only advice would be to use certain items sparingly (piton, bullets, medkits etc.) The other items (canned food/fruit, water, soda, painkillers, etc.) were always available if you looked around and scavenged. I ended the game with a lot more than what I needed.\n\nAltogether, I thought that this was a very good game.

Atmosphere of game is phenomenal; torn up town looks amazing and feels real; even if at closer inspection lack of texture details and low poly models are quite visible, that is not "deal breaker".\nMain problem with game is story, ending and length; game can be finished in some 5h (I have repeat some areas to help all victims, so my overall play time was longer) and I got feeling like I just have started to play it. And even game it self went in direction like it will continue for at least 10h... but then it cuts and roles credits...\nMain character story never get's resolved while ending ruins any potential for sequels (I won't spoil it).\nOver all, game looks like it was rushed to be finished while production was still at 1/3 of development, so they just made cut there, made up some stupid ending and "VOILA!" game is done!

The atmosphere of this game is awsume, it really sucks you in, and you might even start too feel yourself feeling kinda down, and dreary and hopeless like the game portrays so well. The graphics are well done, nothing spectacular mind you, but pull the feel of the world perfectly. I love how even just exploring your surroundings is deadly. The toxic dust will kill you within a few minutes, before you need to climb something tall so you can get above and get some air. Really forces you too think and find the quickest ways around. I love how the combat is done, resources are super limited, finding even a single bullet is like hitting the jackpot! So you really have to stratagize too find ways to take out bad guys using as little as possible. Using bluffs to try to outsmart your opponents, its almost emotinal combat, see if you can bluff your opponent and read his emotional state too see if you can make him surrender, or will you need to use a precious bullet to take him out? Once you take down a group of 5 men using only a single bullet, you will feel like a total badass! Totally recommended if you enjoy exploration, lots of climbing, and a slower paced game. The combat is really different, and alot of fun, but if your wanting an fast paced action game, you won't find it here..","January 12, 2013","true","28.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well, I'm not really a Survival fan, especially when it comes to Survival Horror, but after all the latest Zombies games like Rage and Dead Island - I Am Alive is original, innovative and artistic.\n\nInstead of killing Zombies with a somehow everlasting arsenal of weapons, from blades and clubs to grenade launchers and Molotov cocktails, this time the scenario is far more realistic. An event has occurred, a global catastrophe. The protagonist, after travelling for a full year, returns to his home to try and find his wife and daughter. His enemy? The dust in the air depleting his stamina and health, the physical obstacles (holes, collapsed structures, improvised barriers and barricades, and worst of all - most of the other survivors, stereotypically selfish, evil and deadly).\n\nIf you rush into combat in this game, you'll die. There's no "attack" option, only certain actions requiring careful planning, strategy and patience. A lot of the game is spent trying to figure out how to reach your next destination, by climbing ruins and jumping gaps. My favourite bit about the game is the attention to role-play details. Being able to threaten unarmed opponents to surrender, helping victims in need by sharing supplies for information, and how certain survivors just want to be left alone but won't attack - all create a fantastic mood and suspense of disbelief all the more easy for us deep role-play fans.\n\nThe graphics are smart, by that I mean that the use of dust in the air made it possible to have low quality details as far as the enviornment goes, but high realistic details when it comes to characters and the near surroundings. The music is also great! The actual game-play is not my cup of tea, but I've very glad to have played this game. The story, the mood, the characters, the world - all make for an extremely fun gaming experience. Survival fans? This is most definitely a must game for you lot. Not survival fans? You would still enjoy this, but I would wait a year or two so as to pay a cheaper price.","March 22, 2015","true","28.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Give us something new, a new challenge. This is why I liked I AM ALIVE so much. The resource management aspect of it alone added a whole new layer of challenges to the game. The stamina, the food, the thirst. This game really drew me in and made me feel like I was in danger.\n\nI give this game 9.5 out of 10, if I say why not 10/10 then I'll spoil the plot, but there you go.\n\nI play most of my games with an xbox 360 controller, and Big Picture mode will sort the games by controller support.

This game is prime example of missed opportunity for something extraordinary, but it failed on some crucial steps... but has shine on other. Game has some interesting and decent game mechanics and it plays good for most of time. There is occasional fighting with controls and weird key mapping on PC (you can change it) but nothing serious or unfixable. Atmosphere of game is phenomenal; torn up town looks amazing and feels real; even if at closer inspection lack of texture details and low poly models are quite visible, that is not "deal breaker".\nMain problem with game is story, ending and length; game can be finished in some 5h (I have repeat some areas to help all victims, so my overall play time was longer) and I got feeling like I just have started to play it. And even game it self went in direction like it will continue for at least 10h... but then it cuts and roles credits...\nMain character story never get's resolved while ending ruins any potential for sequels (I won't spoil it).\nOver all, game looks like it was rushed to be finished while production was still at 1/3 of development, so they just made cut there, made up some stupid ending and "VOILA!" game is done! And it's sad that potential this game had, was ruined in such stupid way...\n\nAnd I can recommend it, but keep in mind what I have said; if that doesn't bother you and you want to feel great atmosphere game has, go for it (but get it on some BIG discount).\n\nOver all rating: 5/10","July 16, 2014","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Rather short game for $15, but it was fun. For me the only downsides are the controls, which as I've read work really well with a controller, and that is made very apparent early on with movement and the menu interface when using a keyboard/mouse. The other big downside is the saving feature, its soley based on autosaves, with checkpoints and chapters as you go along. My main gripe with it is that several times when I was playing, after taking a break I would lose progress within a chapter even though I was clearly at a checkpoint, further testing aside, it seems that checkpoints are only active during the current play session. I also kind of dislike how machete use isn't active, its only used from scripted encounters [undetected kill, close "quick time" attack]\n\nTL:DR: worth it on sale, interesting story, decently fun mechanics and combat, hope they continue the story, 4/5","November 4, 2014","true","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

It has an innovative combat system, to were if you aim a gun at someone who has no ranged weapon they will put their hands up, and this means that if there is a fire or cliff nearby, you can kick them into it. However, this gets clunky, and while ammo is scarce if you only pick it up yourself, shoot an enemy that has a gun and  you get your ammo back. A true flaw that feels lazy and unfinished is the story. Your nameless, however not silent protaganist will trust the sketchiest of characters, and the ending doesn't tie up loose ends. It feels as if it was unfinished, or that the studio was going to make a sequel and decided not to do it. Another gripe I have with the game is the stamina. It runs out when you climb, even when standing still on a ledge, which I know from experience is that is not true, and when you are in this "Heavy Fog" as they call it. It's just a lot of dust, and when in it, your stamina goes down, too.  Sure, a dust cloud would impair your breathing, but it wouldn't kill you if you were just walking in it.  I did enjoy playing it, but I want more out of it. It did feel a bit unfinished, and in this review I spoke mostly to the negetives, but if you get this game, you would find that there are plenty of positives, too. So. a great game, just with some glaring flaws. Or at least that's my take on it.","November 6, 2014","true","7.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The washed out landscape with obstructed view makes you feel alone and the limited supplies really make you helpless. I also think it was the first time I felt really guilty about killing someone. The first guy you kill in the game wasn't necessarily an evil guy, just a guy who was scared and at the end of his rope. Everything just happens so fast (for me at least) and at the end, I thought, did I just kill a guy? Maybe its cause there is no tangible reward, but I didn't feel good about it. Even when I had to take out the guys who are after the little girl (who really deserved it) didn't make me feel like I did something great, just that I did what had to be done. I really started to care about what happened to that little girl and worried that if I was gone for too long, something would happen to her. The way the game makes you feel like that without openly shaming you or giving you some kind of morality meter made it feel real. It you want that kind of feeling, and aren't easily frustrated (because the game does not hold your hand at all and managing resources/failing to plan ahead is punishing), give it a try.","March 24, 2015","true","0.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The climbing and combat mechanics are very good and a bit diffrent than the norm, so they take some getting used to, but deffinitly add to the realism.

It's a depressing and gritty game and the designers have been spot on with creating the setting.\nYou spend a lot of time running around and climbing. The climbing mechanics works quite well; you climb in a manner similar to that of AC, but with the added feature that you have limited stamina that decreases while climbing. This means that you only have a limited time climbing before you have to find a secure spot to recover stamina if you don't want to risk dying mid-climb. It's a feature that I actually ended up loving as it added a (slightly) realistic pressure on an otherwise very generic climbing functionality.\nThe game is probably the closest you'll get to Last of Us on PC.\n\nThe graphics on the technical side is mediocre at best. It's clearly a console port and had a bit of extra work been put into the title the graphics could have been so much better.\nThe camera angles - my god. You are not able to zoom out when moving around and you're stuck to the neck all the time and I didn't feel any potential overview being lost. With that said; when climbing large buildings the camera zooms out (some times) to give you a better over of the surrounding routes.\nThe mouse controls are... wonky. Weird sensitivity and it feels sluggish.\nThe groups of enemies you meet are often same combinations as previous encounters, meaning that encounters, though challenging due to very limited resources, become routine.\nVery linear.\n\nDespite the concept of the game was/is great and I loved it, the technical issues and repetitions made it at the same time feel a bit... off. Had you asked me during a gaming session whether I would recommend it or not I'd probably say no. Looking back at it now I'd say yes. In the end it all depends on how accepting you are of the technical limitations of the game.","March 6, 2015","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although you get a message of incompatibility during instalation on Windows 10, it runs perfectly. I'm truly enjoying it. Combat is a little rough on the edges, but the climbing is fine. The AI is decent. The best thing about it is that it's not "shoot on sight", from both player's and NPC's perspectives. Of course some will try and kill you, but others are just waving a gun at your face to protect their belongings. There are the ones who doubt you have bullets - a VERY common scenario - and just go berserk and you have to kill them anyways. Some even surrender.\n\nIt's a post-apocalyptic "save it for a rainy day" Silent Hill. I like it and almost didn't buy it because of criticism.

The game starts out by throwing the player right into the thick of it. You will have to learn as you go that things are bad, really, really bad and only your own wits will help figure out how to survive. Supplies are very limited and making a choice of shooting some thugs versus avoiding them alltogether or giving up precious supplies to aid a civilian in need is always hard. In certain situations these sacrifices that you make will help out, but you never know if you will get anything in return. That is the beauty to the gameplay here, you make your own way to the destinations marked on your map as you discover where you need to go next and the choices you make result in either your survival or death, it is brutal and black and white.\nYou quickly learn to not trust your fellow man and getting creative with your combat is just part of the fun.\n\nThe story will hit home right off the bat and the ending will make you think, but the fetch quests to get to the end make the otherwise realistic feeling of the atmosphere fade and give way to the fact that you are playing a game. However, this everyman appraoch to the character is ultimately what you as the player make it to be and you have the choice to do or not do certain parts of this story quest. Thus making up for the prior shortcoming because you are given a canvas and a paintbrush.\n\nThe graphics leave a lot to be desired and you might be best served by applying mods the reduce the film grain and remove the BW filter from the game, but those are in place for atmospheric reasons and nail the point this game tries to et across. Leaving them on for the first playthrough is recommended.\n\nAs a package there is good replay value and you get a fun experience for your money. The lack of co-op or the ability to join or form factions in the single-player campaign is disheartening as this would have bolstered the experience but as a downloadable title this holds up really well without.","June 25, 2015","true","9.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

People say it could've been better (and it's not uncommon for Ubisoft to promise more and deliver less), but I only saw the final product and I base my opinion on that.\n\nWhat's good\n- Post-apocalyptic setting with modern day people reduced to savage state.\n- The concept of making an extreme effort and losing stamina capacity after depleting the bar.\n- More or less open world with lots of secrets (even a place to catch a breath over the dust-filled streets is a welcome discovery) that often require risky approach to find and reach.\n- Bandits with varying attitude: some don't take you seriously and even try to attack if you hold them at gunpoint for too long without shooting, some are not too brave and submit at gunpoint or after someone else has been shot.\n- Music that fits the visual style (and that creepy loop inside the boat is a full Silent Hill experience).\n\nWhat's bad\n- Clunky controls, with action prompt not always coming up (I had one guy standing IN the fire and still wasn't able to push him; Leonidas in me was disappointed) or the character trying to mimic the camera direction with his movements, refusing to move at all sometimes.\n- Weird gamepad buttons assignment and no way to remap them.\n- Camera is wayward and target switching is way too sensitive (it even allows turning backwards from the enemy, which makes no sense and only brings harm).\n- Weapon slots not assigned to number keys, only to mouse wheel, which makes weapon selection hard to control mid-combat.\n- The ending that feels more unfinished than simply "open".\n\nWhat's broken\n- Keyboard shuts down or gets stuck on one key every now and then, have to plug it out and back in 3-4 times per hour on average. The problem doesn't depend on keyboard manufacturer and is known since\n2012, but has not been patched to this day. Given the Ubisoft officials' initial refusal to port the game at all (and the game is worth porting, despite its flaws) on the ground of all PC gamers being pirates, such obvious bug in PC version is appaling to say the least. Well, modern day Ubisoft can't even make a Tetris game right…\n\nSo, I give it 7.5/10. The game is overall enjoyable if you are into exploration, but it's a bit unfinished and seriously lacks quality in porting.","February 15","true","38.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was wrong. It's not awful, but it's clunky and uninspired. You will soon enough realize you are far from the only one who is alive (I certainly didn't feel like a ''lone survivor'' for long... maybe 5 minutes of gameplay?), and the reason for the death of the majority of the population is never explained in any satisfying way. Though the game itself is only moderately challenging, the clunky controls and camera and awful combat make it fairly annoying to play. There is survival aspects at play here, and some work fairly well, but some game mechanics feel unnecessary or cliché. Last but not least, I Am Alive is very linear, which is very much a missed opportunity in this type of game. When you do try to explore, you are often reminded that ''you're going the wrong way'' or something along those lines.\n\nAs I said above it's not an awful game, but there are so many much, much better games to play that I wouldn't recommend I Am Alive except if you are a complete fan of the genre and you've played every other game already, and it is on sale.","January 5","false","5.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It´s really necessary if three or four enemies attack you - then you have to be really quick. But i want to say again that it´s nearly impossible to defeat three or more enemies in one try.

The atmosphere is very well done and the world is quite immersive (if you can excuse some of the control issues).\n\nTHAT BEING SAID:  (SPOILERS)\n\nThis game is unfinished and will never be finished. There is no real story arc other than some amorphous bull about finding someone missing that will never come to fruition for the player.  Controls, as mentioned are frustrating to learn, and even once mastered, can easily be screwed up by happenstance (like, trying to jump somewhere but instead leaping to your death).\n\nIf you don't go into this game expecting a full, round, complete experience, you'll be better off for it, BUT this game will give you an interesting experience that I haven't really gotten from many other games.","January 30","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

People say it could've been better (and it's not uncommon for Ubisoft to promise more and deliver less), but I only saw the final product and I base my opinion on that.\n\nWhat's good\n- Post-apocalyptic setting with modern day people reduced to savage state.\n- The concept of making an extreme effort and losing stamina capacity after depleting the bar.\n- More or less open world with lots of secrets (even a place to catch a breath over the dust-filled streets is a welcome discovery) that often require risky approach to find and reach.\n- Bandits with varying attitude: some don't take you seriously and even try to attack if you hold them at gunpoint for too long without shooting, some are not too brave and submit at gunpoint or after someone else has been shot.\n- Music that fits the visual style (and that creepy loop inside the boat is a full Silent Hill experience).\n\nWhat's bad\n- Clunky controls, with action prompt not always coming up (I had one guy standing IN the fire and still wasn't able to push him; Leonidas in me was disappointed) or the character trying to mimic the camera direction with his movements, refusing to move at all sometimes.\n- Weird gamepad buttons assignment and no way to remap them.\n- Camera is wayward and target switching is way too sensitive (it even allows turning backwards from the enemy, which makes no sense and only brings harm).\n- Weapon slots not assigned to number keys, only to mouse wheel, which makes weapon selection hard to control mid-combat.\n- The ending that feels more unfinished than simply "open".\n\nWhat's broken\n- Keyboard shuts down or gets stuck on one key every now and then, have to plug it out and back in 3-4 times per hour on average. The problem doesn't depend on keyboard manufacturer and is known since\n2012, but has not been patched to this day. Given the Ubisoft officials' initial refusal to port the game at all (and the game is worth porting, despite its flaws) on the ground of all PC gamers being pirates, such obvious bug in PC version is appaling to say the least. Well, modern day Ubisoft can't even make a Tetris game right…\n\nSo, I give it 7.5/10.

The dialoges are honest and there is not too much nor to little talk going on between the charakters. There is lots of stuff to explore in a price-of-persia/Assassins-creed-like fashion that requires some thinking and planing ahead in order to acomplish. The small riddles are well hiden as well and deliver a pleasent feeling of satisfaction after you complet them.\n\nWithout revealing too much of the story to you, all I want to point out is that after finishing the game for the first time, I felt like there is still too much to do to let it end there. :)\nThe worst drawback of the game is the bad camera handling. Quite frequently the camera wouldn't turn according to the mouse's movement like hitten a wall with it. I really wonder why that failure still exists at this time though...\n\nIf you get the chance to get this game at a cheaper price, I honestly recommend you to give it a try it's a hidden "Double chocolate cookie" ^^","February 23","true","12.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you want to see a really good IDEA for a game, this is a decent pick-up. I think this is a good look for game developers looking to see how scavenging mechanics can be implemented fairly well. Ammo is scarce, climbing is dangerous and your supply of safety equipment is extremely limited, and still this game gives you a way to complete challenges. The atmosphere is very well done and the world is quite immersive (if you can excuse some of the control issues).\n\nTHAT BEING SAID:  (SPOILERS)\n\nThis game is unfinished and will never be finished. There is no real story arc other than some amorphous bull about finding someone missing that will never come to fruition for the player.  Controls, as mentioned are frustrating to learn, and even once mastered, can easily be screwed up by happenstance (like, trying to jump somewhere but instead leaping to your death).\n\nIf you don't go into this game expecting a full, round, complete experience, you'll be better off for it, BUT this game will give you an interesting experience that I haven't really gotten from many other games.","January 30","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has his flaws but the atmosphere and the universe is overwhelming.

Input lag, unstable areas that even an R9 390 cant handle and broken parts that make the game just unplayable isn't a good sign. I never played this on console, however after plugging in a controller, I still found the game to stutter and most of the time not even register many button presses. This caused me to fail some missions, not due to difficulty, but due to my button presses not being registered by the game. After revealing the controller to not be the fix, I moved back to mouse and keyboard. Certain areas will almost appear as though the game has switched your DPI down automatically as dragging the mouse around stops working momentarily. This issue I found most annoying.\n\nMy opinion would be to buy this game only if you're a Ubisoft fan, and don't intend on playing it or can overlook these issues, but to everyone else, the game is too broken to enjoy. I was lucky enough to pick up this game at 80% off, but still feel ripped off. If you do buy/have bought it, I'd recommend requesting a refund or else it'll end up being another addition to your steam library that will get uninstalled and never installed again.","May 24","false","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
