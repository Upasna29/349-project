GoD (Graphite or Diamond) Factory is definitely the space shooter I have been looking for. It has a tremendous amount of different playstyles available, with not only a staggering number of parts for customization (this is the first game I have played in a long time in which I was happy to have a part unlock system) but also 4 different races to choose from. Also, while each races has it's own list of parts for every possible ship part, these pieces can still also be put on the ships of other races, opening up even more possible customization options. Additionally as a nice stylistic feature, almost every part of the ships you build have some effect on it's appearance, even internal ones like the power core. There is also a very nice focus on team play, plus features which actually facilitate team cooperation and communication. While the game is set to have other modes in the future, I still love the carrier assault mode that has the center of all available versions of the game so far. Finally, while I would definitely advise that you do the tutorials before playing any matches, GoD Factory is in my opinion very easy to pick up as a new player and be an effective part of your team. This is partially due to the fact that ships in this game do not die quickly. It normally takes quite a lot of effort in order to take down an enemy ship. However I should mention that there is a very good reason for this, in this game once you lose a ship it is replaced for the rest of the match by a weaker species specific drone. The drone can respawn, but every time it does so it gets a longer respawn timer. GoD Factory is a game which rewards cautious gameplay styles, or at the very least play styles that don't try to act like a one man army.","August 27, 2014","true","225.9"," 162 of 195 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","162","195","0","3"

There's one gaping problem:\n\nNo one is playing. Logged in, ran the tutorial, bought a little missile group for my ship, hit quick match and!!.....no players online. Nothing.\n\nSo, I start a pure bots match. Worst idea ever. No-one to communicate with, no one to learn from, no one to play with. Bots seem to have the perfect reflexes, can pull off all these neat little manuver combos that leave you dead and them from in front of you to behind, left, up, and stabbing you with a stick while you feel like you're picking your nose.\n\nI'd reccomend this game if it only had a player base.

Some could argue its not a MOBA, but its objective based gameplay make its very similar, also there is the factor that it uses respawn system and base that has turrets.\n\nOne thing that really shined through for me was the soundtrack, it is one of these OST that end up in your playlists in Youtube since they are that good. Heck i could even buy the album, since i love the sounds so much. I think its comparable to Deus EX soundtracks by its style, but it really stand on its own though.\n\nThe Overall verdict is that the game requires either gamepad and joystick, if your not going to sink tens of hours to the game, i doubt you will understand the game fully, while its not EVE Online i still think its quite depth for the type of a game God Factory Wingmen is. I Suggest buying Pre-Order since you get another copy of the game which you can give it to your friend for example or as a giveaway.","August 24, 2014","true","0.8"," 50 of 58 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","50","58","8","0"

It is designed as a team game and if you beleive for an instant that you're not part of a team but rather some special little snowflake meant to take on the entire enemy team by yourself... you will get smashed into the ground- errr... nearest asteroid.\n\nBuy it. It's a great callback to the kind of high-skillcap, highly punishing games, of the glorious old days of PC gaming.\n\nPS. There's not much grinding in the game, if you win a game you get quite a bit of credits to spend on parts.","August 31, 2014","true","33.7"," 61 of 78 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","61","78","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Montyblancs/recommended/262750/","Montyblancs","Montblanc","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Montyblancs/","307 products in account","This game is essentially the space battles in Star Wars Battlefront II without the small on-foot interior sections. Fly at the enemy's ship and blow up their components with bombers, or attack other enemy ships with fighters in 4v4 fights.\n\nCustomization is good, the individual parts don't make a huge overall difference, but it's easy to spec out what type of ship you're aiming to make. The overall ship style is pretty neat as well, with additional colors being unlocked by accomplishing steam achivements in game. The graphics are great, the environments and ships are amazingly detailed.\n\nBut, here's why I can't honestly reccomend the game.\n\nFirst and foremost, if you crash one of your ships, it's gone for the rest of the round, replaced with a very mediocre drone. I had to check the tutorials again to reconfirm this, but this is a huge pain considering rounds typically last 10-20 minutes. Now, I know it's rather easy to evade other players with a combination of boosting, manuvers, and special abilities, but being unable to use the ship you've designed for the rest of the round is a mental nightmare, and extremely discouraging. Essentially, you've been crippled for the rest of the game, and it's difficult to stage a comeback because of it.\n\nNext up is the controls. This is strictly a controller/joystick game. Mouse and keyboard controls are inherently flawed from the getgo because of both the default bindings, and the difficulting in turning. I believe initial bindings have the ship roating with mouse side movements, and turning binded to the A and D keys. I ended up flipping these bindings and found it far more usable. However, in dogfights that require you to constantly be turning, you are phsyically incapable of turning fast enough due to you having you keep dragging the mouse in one direction, and you will run out of desk space. Plug a controller in, save yourself the hassle.\n\nOnce you understand the previous two complaints and try to work around them, you have the rest of the game open to you. The issue is, the rest of the game appears to be exactly like your first game, with different players, and different parts, and holy hell does it get old fast. I understand the idea that it's esentially trying to be a MOBA, where everyone plays one gametype and attempts to win via various strategies, but the difference between ships in this game is limited to stats, weapons, and abilities. Some abilities are a get out of jail free card (short range teleport through walls, decoy ship), while some are minor boosts, and some just feel like they're negated entirely if the other player boosts away. Mechanically, besides for the fact that some ships make better bombers, and some ships make better fighters, you're going to be playing the same thing over and over. The game's part experience and currency system will pretty much enforce this.\n\nOverall it feels this game could be better as a F2P based on it's grindy systems, selling cosmetics for income. A $20 pricepoint for one game mode and map is a very steep barrier of entry that in my opinion does not pay off for the content provided.","August 29, 2014","false","2.3"," 263 of 415 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","263","415","0","13"

I really enjoyed my time in the beta and am looking forward to the full release.  Even more so that I have an Oculus Rift to play it on now!\n\nOnto the game itself.  It doesn't have a vast amount of content, but what content it has is very good.  The space battles are engaging and take quite a bit of skill(and teamwork!) to do well in.  My only concern at the moment is this game not getting enough support to keep online thriving.  Ship customization is decent, but feels a bit restrictive at times.  As with most competitive games I really feel like there is one best loadout to have.  I didn't figure it out, but I am sure others were able to piece together 2 ships that were better than the rest.  If you liked Battlefront II space battles and you want to play a more fleshed out version, get this game.

The reason why I bought the bundle was not this game; in fact, I had never even heard of it before and it just seemed like a nice added bonus.\n\nBoy, was I wrong!\nHere's a quick run-down of the pros and cons:\n\nPros:\n+Get in the mood! Starting in the the main screen and throughout the entire game, the music is excellent!\n+Eye-candy all the way! Space combat has rarely looked so good!\n+Riveting gameplay! Blow away your opponents while just barely avoiding the giant debris floating around!\n+Work as a team! Throw out tons of damage with synergies and combos!\n+Coordinate! Succeed together with the easy-to-use communication system!\n+Play your way! 4 playable races and a huge amount of ship customization options!\n+Become stronger! With the progression system, there is always something new to reach for and discover!\n\nCons:\n-Steep learning curve. Some people might find it hard to get into, but the tutorial is great and really helps with that. Plus, experienced players are very helpful and are happy to give you some pointers!\n-Small player base. We need more people to play with! Fortunately, literally everyone I've met in-game so far has been nice, helpful, and fun to be around!\n\nAfter having played GoDF for a while, I can say with absolute sincerity that I am in love with it. Nowadays, I rarely find new games with so much attention to detail, where you can really feel the passion poured into it by the developers. I consider every aspect of it to be well-executed and highly enjoyable.\nPlus, you can really feel the impact of all your choices, whether in the hangar, building completely different ships or in combat out in the field, fighting alongside your allies!\n\nIf you're looking for a breath of fresh gaming air and friendly people to play with, GoD Factory: Wingmen is definitely for you!\nSo what are you waiting for?

The game is amazing. If you enjoy masses of customisation options, team play orientated play and space sims in general, GoD Factory: Wingmen is a must buy.\n\nGraphically the game is great and the audio is equally as good, and that was even before the new BGM has been put in (and if Dual Dragon's previous work is anything to go by, this will pretty sweet too).\n\nThe gameplay requires good team coordination in order to take down the very durable carrier components which will in turn put a variety of debuffs on the pilots and carrier itself. Games themselves are relatively short, never exceeding 25 minutes, which is great for getting back to spending your hard earned credits on the customisations.\n\nThe community around the game has been great up to now and it will be great to see that grow with a full release. The devs are all very open, helpful and fun to spend time with and it was great to fly along-side of (or against) during the past few months.\n\nIn my opinion, it is definately worth checking out, and is really good value for money at the £15 price tag.\n\n","August 1, 2014","true","208.3"," 38 of 52 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","38","52","0","0"

If you pick this game up, be wary that you may not find people online to play it with. This is very sad, it's so good.\n\nThis is a great title, which is saying something coming from me - I am not traditionally a huge fan of PvP games, but this does tick the boxes: solid gameplay; interesting mechanics; rewarding intelligent and strategic teamplay.\n\nDespite playing through the tutorial, it did take me some time to get used to the carrier parts and the controls, especially as I am using keyboard and mouse, but using a controller will also give a good experience. Though it is a punishing game with a high skill cap, I find myself enjoying it, despite my lack of skill. Something to work on, I suppose.\n\nThe idea about the game itself is pretty simple. It's not a deathmatch; matches are up to 4 v 4 (including bots should you wish to do so), and the two teams try to destroy the enemy carrier (base) by destroying components (in the vein of Star Wars Battlefront II). If the two carriers are destroyed at the same time, then the team which has destroyed the most enemy gunships (your fighters) is considered the winner. The race-specific abilities and the purchasable add-ons also make the game quite interesting and refreshing, forcing people to think carefully about their resources and how to use them - the cooldowns can be crippling if something is used at the wrong time.\n\nThe game looks great, with 4 very different races available to choose from. The ship and component designs are all vividly different from one another with clear distinctions and very interesting designs. The weapons are a particular highlight, with a huge variety all looking very nice. The great look is complemented by the maps - as of Galaxy Update 1.1 (15/11/2014) - there are now 4... the two carriers and the surrounding area, including the cover you can find from man-made factories in the area or the immense statue nearby all look great. The 3 new maps all include new unique and interesting mechanics in addition to more stunning visuals. One offers damage dealing locations, one offers healing, and one has teleporters spaced around the map. This is complemented by the game's audio. The soundtrack is absolutely brilliant, I could listen to it for hours on end. The sound design for the space combat is quite good too, disregarding the impossibility of sounds being heard in space... but who cares? Music makes it more awesome.\n\nOne of the things I like most about this game is the customisation available for your ships. You start with two basic ships from two races, but are quickly able to buy more. While you do need to "grind" to unlock better parts - keep an eye out on the "tech tree" in the shop to see what you want to unlock and work towards those parts - the grind is not excessive like in some other games. The range of options available is incredible, and offers a huge range of options forcing you to make some hard decisions: do you upgrade a lower tier part to it's max level or do you skip it and use a weaker higher tier part until you can level that up? This is supported by something I quite personally like - the fact that achievements unlock further cosmetic options. This makes it interesting and fun to collect achievements if you can, while not rewarding these achievements with OP ship parts. Thus, a failure to be skilled or lucky enough to acquire an achievement will not punish you further by ensuring you will be left with comparatively substandard parts.\n\nFinally, I am pretty happy with the game developers, who are maintaining a strong presence in the community, always on top of launch issues and always happy to talk with the players and keep them up-to-date. Very, very happy with my decision to buy this game.","September 1, 2014","true","60.0"," 23 of 27 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","23","27","0","2"

Dogfighting is a genre that really fell by the wayside, and for someone nostalgic for games like Wing Commander and Freelancer (for the combat), this game really scratches the itch. If you pick it up, you're going to have a mostly good time, with two notable problems:\n\n1. This game does not excel at accesibility. Learning how to play requires about an hour of interactive tutorials, and I can't stress this enough: They are totally necessary. Imagine playing League of Legends without knowing that Flash is a thing. Without two of the tutorials, you won't know how to perform this game's version of flash. As long as you can tolerate the tutorials, though, and spend some time researching all the different ship parts, this game REALLY opens up after your first couple of matches.\n\n2. The community is still pretty small. Finding a match with eight human players takes a long time, and due to the difficulty curve I mentioned, bots start at unforgivingly hard for your first couple matches to face rollingly easy. Try to have a group who enjoys playing together if you want to get the most out of this game.\n\nThe ship customization is deep and very satisfying, the combat is intense and engaging, and the objectives are strategic and original. Every point you score gives the enemy team some kind of debuff, making target priority an interesting strategic decision.\n\nIf you want competitive dogfighting (especially if you have friends who do too) and don't mind a difficulty curve (SERIOUSLY, DO THE TUTORIALS) then you're going to love this game.","November 14, 2014","true","5.4"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

When you look at other developers like Square-Enix and Psyonix (Nosgoth) who simply don't even interact with their community much; even with a larger team, it's easy to see that this game has a special "flare" to it.\n\nThe gameplay reminds me of the old Gamecube games for Star wars (Rogue squadron) and it has all of that and so much more. The game is 90% bug-free (small bugs every now and then) but I can host games on my low-end machine and it runs great.\n\nThe controls can be a little hard to grasp at first, the first few games me and a few friends died a few times against the bots while working out what we had to do and how to do it, but after the 4th attempt we managed to win fast and not die at all.\n\nSo i'll say this, anyone who is having trouble with a mouse + keyboard - Keep at it. It gets easier.\n\nThe only downside at the moment is the slightly confusing shop/modification menu. The tutorial covers a lot of basic flight information but nothing in the menu and It looks a little scattered. But this could just be my slightly older, logical brain talking.\n\n-That being said, it can be slightly hard in-game to stabilise yourself, I have been using the woman in the background to work that out.\n\nOverall, having not been a part of the beta I wouldn't know how the devs are in terms of time/patch releases, but this game looks completely polished. I can't really judge it after 3 hours of gameplay, but if I was forced to i'd give it a 9/10.\n\nThe one point missing is the small gripes, but they are really small.\n\nI look forward to spending a lot of time on this in between studying.","August 29, 2014","true","17.3"," 37 of 52 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","37","52","0","0"

Then I checked the game's recent statistics and found this:\n\nCurrent players: 4 (@7pm EST)\n30-day Avg: 2.3\n30-day gain: -1.9\n\nCouple those dismal numbers with a potentially final update mentioning a new project and Wingmen's lack of profitability, and the game really starts looking like a ghost ship. It's a shame, even a short single-player campaign alone might have added enough draw and mitigated the learning curve enough to sustain an online player base.

That said, I can't recommend it, at least not at the current price of $20.\n\nLet's start out with what's good. The game has an excellent engine, runs very smoothly, and has no notable lag issues. Initial match load times can be slow but after that it's generally smooth sailing to the finish. The graphics are good, not exceptional but nothing to complain about either.\n\nShips are varied, and the customization options are deep and satisfying. Taking 2 ships into each battle allows each player to prepare multiple tactics and adjust on the fly. Ships can be shared with comrades in battle. The dogfighting is solid and the carriers offer a variety of targets and strategies. A good match is a hell of a lot of fun.\n\nSo why not buy it?\n\nGFW is an online battle arena with no single player campaign of any kind. That in itself is not a problem, except that there's currently only one multiplayer gametype, with only one map. I think the deficiency here is pretty self-explanatory. I have been assured more are coming by a developer, but until then is now, it's an issue. I believe this game should be properly classified with the "Early Access" titles at this point.\n\nGetting a game started, especially at non-peak times, involves a lot of waiting. As of this review, the community averages 30-40 players at midday, and 80-100 peak. A full session is 8 players, and less is not nearly as much fun. The game allows you to substitute bots of varying configuration and difficulty, which would be good except that the bots currently provide better rewards than real opponents, so the lobby list is full of rooms with 1-2 people and 6-7 bots. The developer also assures me that bot rewards will be reduced soon. It can't come soon enough, in my opinion.\n\nCompounding the frustration of the small community are a variety of social features the game is lacking. It does not populate Steam's "recent players" list, so you have to manually search for anyone you want to friend, and then sort through the many results. It does not offer in-game voice chat of any kind. It does not offer basic options such as blocking chat from a disruptive player. There is no solution to an idle host, aside from leaving and starting a new lobby. There is no persistent squad chat, as squads are immediately disbanded after each match. Communication mid-game is bolstered by a nice team command broadcast menu, but this can't be assigned to a gamepad like everything else can.\n\nSome final notes: Gamepad support is a plus, but the recommended mappings beg to be reassigned immediately. The music is great at first, but the one extended track rapidly becomes repetitive. The tutorial is helpful and gives you a credit boost to start, but is frustratingly segmented. Notice how everything is "good, but...."\n\nBottom line: Unless you are a space combat fanatic, wait for more features and a lower price. You can get a hell of a lot more for $20 out of the Steam catalogue.","September 10, 2014","false","42.3"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

With only one game mode and a single map that has randomly placed parts between you and the ship. You'd think you would get bored fast. But you honestly don't. There is always something to unlock even hitting the max level. The ships and weapon customization make it the game.\n\nFor $10, an instant buy in my book. $20...eeeeeeeh, if you're a hardcore space sim type of person, buy it.\n\nI'm currently using mouse and keyboard and have no issue dominating. Sometimes moving the mouse is a bit much but I don't find it a problem. With that said, I have  a Joystick on order for Star Citizen. I will update this review with a joystick once I try it out.\n\nEdit: Joysticks\nI got my HOTAS setup and the mapping wizard in game is great. However, I feel a little slower with the joystick than I do with a mouse. That might have a lot to do with the fact I'm still new to a HOTAS setup. As of right now, the support is there and works.

My experience with this game was really positive; it's a polished title that is a unique experience, especially among the space sim revival we're currently experiencing. I'll break particular aspects of the game down below:\n\nControls:\nI'll get this out of the way right now; this game currently does not have my joystick supported (x52) but I've been reassured by the devs that the kinks for this particular model will be worked out by launch. Despite my personal joystick not working too well, the joysticks at PAX East functioned brilliantly; the input felt responsive and smooth. A lot of the gameplay of GoD Factory doesn't rely super heavily on twitch aiming, so it's possible the finer aiming problems weren't evident. The game also allows for some really cool manuevers while still maintaining a high level of accessibility (the ideal easy to learn, difficult to master, which I think is an overarching design decision for this game as a whole). A sort of temporary newtonian mode (almost like drifting) allows for some slick, intense dogfights.\n\nCore Gameplay:\nThe standard gamemode for this is heavily strategic. It allows for teams to asses their strengths, the enemy's weakness, then assault the enemy in a manner that they deem will cripple them the most. Perhaps the enemy has a lot of lock-on missiles; destroying the radar tower would make it more difficult for target acquisition. Things like that. There's a lot of replayability in the core gameplay (carrier v. carrier) alone. In the future however, to maybe avoid things getting a bit stale, consider different carrier ships or even game modes. I don't forsee the core game getting stale for a long time though.\n\nMechanics:\nThis is where this game really shines for me. Finally, the ability to modularly construct your ship without a straight upgrade path. Heavier weapons? Well now your ship is slower. Let's put a bigger engine one...now you need more energy. Slap a bigger power core on; now you're generating more heat. There's a really smart system behind this that really allows for no single 'best build' ship.  I'm very excited to see what kind of weird builds the community comes up with. I was able to swap between mine laying ships to support/snaring ships, to sort of rocket bombers. All within the first tier of gameplay. It's honestly very head spinning, even beyond just the simple weapons. Once you delve into power cores, ship bodies/wings, computers, etc. it can almost become a game in of itself. Particular weapons don't just become more powerful either; the model that the devs have constructed allows for really slim, minimalistic ships to potentially be viable. Combining this crazy individual customization with a 4 man team is a recipe for infinite replayability. Think Dota 2 meets X-wing.\n\nI almost forgot combos: Weapons have damage types that can potentially be combined with other damage types that allow for combos to form. I can't imagine how difficult/awesome it's going to be to pull off some of the higher level tier combos with my friends.\n\nGraphics/Audio:\nPersonally, graphics aren't a major factor for me. Especially with a game like this that has such strategic depth. I will say that the art style is definitely unique, and I'm very happy to report that your customized modular ships actually change appearance with every part. That, to me, means that the graphics definitely do their job. It also allows the game to be a lot more accessible hardware wise, which is great for the potential esport future of this game.\n\nOverall:\nTo summarize my beta/PAX experience, this game looks really solid and I'm furious I can't play it right now. The game is accessible for gamers who aren't 'pilots' but allows for seasoned aces to pull off some awesome stuff. It has an interesting gameplay mode with an incredibly in-depth ship building mechanism that is dizzying in depth. All at a very reasonable price.","August 5, 2014","true","19.5"," 19 of 26 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","19","26","0","0"

However if you are looking for causal fun where you can just hop in and shoot at some starfighters that's probably not the game for you.\nIt's not very clear from the description but essentially this is a MOBA. And that's not a bad thing at all because the MOBA format fits the dogfighting just perfect!\nSo to describe you the mechanics: every match there are two carriers shooting the hell of eachother and here you come with your two fighters trying to destroy the enemy carrier first. In order to be successful you and your teammates should concentrate on one of it's 9 parts at a time (2 of which are inside the hull itself!). What's great is that by destroying a part you not only are helping to bring the enemy carrier down but depending of the party you've destroyed that puts the enemy team in a specific disadvantage (for example if you destroy the Ammo Warehouse the enemy team won't be able to fill the ammo of their fighters to the full set). As I mentioned earlier you bring two of your fighter to the match. You can switch between them by docking to the carrier. When docked your fighters get their ammo refilled and their shield gradually recovering. As for the fighters themselves they are fully customisable. Each fighter consist of 12/13 parts (depending on the number of weapons) which you can combine as you see fit. When using the parts in a match that later unlocks upgrades for them and gives you acces to new ones. All this gives the matches great strategic dept and variety.\nThis may be MOBA but there are no microtransactions. You just pay the price for the game and unlock all your parts by playing.\nThe game mechanics are great but there is something else you should know before considering a purchase.\nThere are not many people playing it. My guess is because the game is somehow demanding of you. You need quite some time to figure things like the combo system, carries layout, the fighter's builds that best fits your playstyle and so on. So if you hop into a game at a random time the chance are you will just meet 1 - 2 players playing against bots. However the people playing it are very friendly and are often willing to get out of their way to show you the ropes and make you feel welcome. And because they are so few they organize events where so they can log on on the same time and have full scale matches. So it is not that there are not people to play the game with but rather you will be able to paly with them on a specific time.\nSo if the game mechanics seems fun to you and you don't mind making some new friends I can wholeheartedly recommend the game for you.","January 2","true","95.2"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","10","11","0","0"

The art design and gameplay are superb and it's really fun blasting around the galaxy having dogfights and attacking the carriers. The 4 vs 4 format works really well and the ship customization is very deep.\n\nI would describe this game as Starfox meets Zone of The Enders; even envoking classic space shooters like Wing Commander. The gameplay is very fast and it's a lot of fun once you get the hang of flying. I would advise turning the sensitivity up as it's set very low initially and feels a bit difficult to turn. Otherwise a mouse and keyboard work great for this game (I imagine it would play equally well on a gamepad or joystick). There are also tons of different weapon combinations and every ship you encounter will be fairly unique. The music is also well executed and provides a nice atmosphere.\n\nThe only drawback is that there is no storyline and one map. I really like the map however as it's very detailed with many structures and a huge area to fly in. There is enough variety in it that it really feels different each time. Plus it's beautiful to look at so it doesn't feel repetitive.\n\nThe devs are super cool and are online playing frequently. They seem very receptive to player feedback and genuiley interested in making a great game. Nine Dots Studio is planning on adding more content in the future, so I wouldn't be surprised if there are more maps and story missions on the way.

Its a nice balance of arcady dog fighting action and pseudo simulation space combat.\n\nYou want to feel like Luke Skywalker fighting off the Deathstar? Fly in to the enemy ship take out their shield generator, then hit their core and by the time you finish that off the enemy carrier is about to go up in smoke.\n\nIt has a really interesting hit and run mechanic. It takes time to repair your ship, which can mostly only be done in the docking bay of your own carrier. Also burning through ammo happens pretty frequent. So it really encourages you to go back to the dock and swap out your ships to repair/reload your old one.\n\nThe ship customizing is a lot of fun. There are a lot of variables to take in to account to customize your fighter. Slow ships seem like they'll be better at defending your own carrier. Fast ships with light payloads seem better for hit and run tactics on the enemy carrier. But if you're to slow at hit and running the enemy carrier parts may heal up your damage. So, maybe its better to take more ammo or higher damaging weapons, but then it'll slow you down and make it harder to run away in a dog fight. So many things to consider, and so much fun to be had.\n\nIts also nice that fighter parts aren't 100% better upgrades. You can level up parts to make them stronger, but they come at the cost of requiring more energy, heat, or weight. So sometimes it is better to go with a lower level part just so you don't weigh yourself down and can boost for longer and faster. This also means that low level ships when you first start do have some small advantages over higher level ships. While you don't be able to stand toe to toe with the highest level guys, you still won't be completely screwed either.\n\nAlso, unlocking and leveling up parts is at a very steady progression. When you first start the game you'll have more credits then you know what to do with. But after that you won't have enough credits to get what you really want, but it only takes about 2 games to get enough credits to unlock what you want. So it never feels too grindy.\n\nThe current game community is really small. But I personally have been having a lot of fun still just playing against Bots. I've been in one game with 4v4 and the game completely changes. Suddenly those hit and run tactics aren't so effective against players (because bots are stupid).  But I assume its still viable, just need to rethink it a bit.\n\nI feel this game is the perfect level of space sim and arcade dog fighting action. For example, it's really satisfying to fly past an enemy fighter, do a quick 180 degree maneuver, cut out the engines for a sec to continue to drift forwards and blow your enemy to ribbons as they attempt to do the same thing. Some real epic space combat there.\n\nI highly recommend this game. Its awesome.

However all of this simply makes the game somewhat more bittersweet in its failures. As is so often the case with these sorts of beautiful battle arena type games, Two factors in particular have led to the writing of this review. Either by itself would probably not be an issue, but combined they have made the game an exercise in frustration.\n\nFirstly is the slow matchmaking. Matches take a full 8 players every time, and will not start with less. One person sitting Afk in a lobby can completely stall up an entire match and force you to go looking for another one. The host can kick them, but as half the time the host is the one AFK, this does not help much. Half the time quickmatch will que you back with the same said afk person for several minutes before finding you a new lobby. Admittedly however, dev's do seem to be working on this.\n\nSecondly is imbalance. Matches will quite often throw you as a rank amateur against teams of entirely seasoned vets/aces. This might not be an issue if the game autobalanced to give lowbies a better chance, but sadly it does not. And where as you would hope most of the community would want a fair fight, it is more often than not that you will enter a lobby only to find a team of max rank individuals fighting a team of complete rank 1/2 newbies. With very few people willing to give up said obvious highground it is often about as fruitless as being with the afk people because no lowbie dares want to hit ready and start up that obvious loss. Like with the AFK hosts, you will often find yourself thrown back up against the same team of all max ranks 3-4 times till hopefully another match pops up, or like I did, you stop playing. Once again, according to a response by devteam, this is an issue they are working on, but at the moment it is still an issue on nonetheless. Hopefully as the game progreses these things will become nonissues, and we can all enjoy some dogfighting.\n\nEdited~ A swift response from Dev's informed me I was incorrect about slates not being wiped before official launch and I have redacted my complaint on the matter.","August 31, 2014","false","4.6"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","2"

In this game you get to play as a completely customized ship built to your liking, in a purely skill based action game. You don't have to worry about people outleveling you, as there are no levels in this game. Items are ship parts that do different attacks, for example, one cannon could be a lock on type, and another could be a skillshot that deals three times more damage than the one previously mentioned. This allows you to play any which way you like, instead of having to find one hero or champion out of many. you never feel like losing was someone else's fault, and that's a nice jump from the toxic blaming of normal MOBAS, and for a guy with over 1k hours in DotA 2, I can say for a fact that this game has an amazing community compared to the average MOBA. The "ancient" or "base" is very unique, as there are multiple parts on the enemy base that when destroyed, give you a bonus and the enemy a handicap they have to play the rest of the game with. This game is very refreshing, and the only reason i have not played much of this game is well, the problem with this game is how small the community is.\n\nthe problem with this game is that the community is a little bit to small, and it can be hard to find a match. this is probably because as a skill based game, the people that stick with the game will obliterate you untill you have about 3-4 hours of practice, and even then you can barely keep up with them. i pre-purchased this game, and i stopped playing it because of how small the community is, and i would not say that it is worth a 20 dollar price point. but when this game goes on sale, pick it up. it is worth your time.\n\nSo, here's a quick summary for you if you were to lazy to read that.\n\nPOSITIVE:\n-Very good graphics for a MOBA\n-Unique, and refreshing\n-Great community, Dedicated for the most part\n-You can unlock everything in the game, and tweak your ship to your own playstyle\n-The Devs are very dedicated to this game\n\nCONS\n-the only con in this game is how small the community really is.\n\nWould i get this for 20? no. but when it comes on sale, pick it up. you will love this game if you are into thrilling, fast paced games and MOBAS. And if not, this game still probably has something for you.\n\n","April 9, 2015","true","5.2"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","6","6","0","0"

The game has a surpring depth of ship (i.e., class customization) as well as a few varied races to choose from. The mode in the beta was very fun ... a sort of base defense mode where you were tasked with destroying key parts of the enemys ship (aka base) before they can destroy yours.

I'm certainly not the first and definitely not the last person to say this, but this is the first game in quite a while that has given me a legitimate reason to want to buy a joystick.\n\nFirstly if money is a factor that makes you hesitate then at the time I'm writing this I would hold off for a bit, as the game is majorly PvP centric and getting a good match going can be difficult at the moment due mainly to a low population. You can play against bots but players are always the better choice, and the bots don't exactly go easy on new players even at low ranks. There is a major update incoming as well as a free weekend so if this interests you keep and eye and give it a shot while its free.\n\nThe game itself has a lot of depth, which is both good and bad. I personally really enjoy the detail that goes into building your own personal ship as well as the great deal of options in game of both tactics and maneuvers, however there is a LOT to learn, which can certainly get in the way of getting comfortable playing the game. It can be rather daunting starting out but I found that it gets better and better the more you learn. One mistake thats easy to make is getting too hung up on ship setups and equipment. Most weapons and such handle similarly enough (there are of course exceptions) that a player whos got good control skills will do well and one without will almost always do poorly, so I would focus more on getting the gameplay control down before worrying too much about trying to make a super flying deathmachine.\n\nMost of the regular players are quite friendly and can give some pretty good advice.\n\n\nShip Customization:\n\nThere are tiers of ship parts, for the core frame parts (wings, body, cockpit) the higher tiers are generally higher stats but higher requirements as well, so higher end is generally stronger if you can fit it in.\n\nSome special parts such as abilities and special equipment often have radically different effects with a same basic idea behind them per tier, so while higher may cost more it will not always be better performance wise depending on what you want to use it for.\n\nweapons work similarly to the core parts but with the damage types and constraint limits with many high end parts, as well as the flexibility of having two wing weapons, maximum tier versions of the weapon are not always the best choice.\n\nShip constraints are determined by parts such as the body, and generator and such, however the constraints themselves are not hard capped, you can exceed the constraints and take a penalty based on what category you're exceeding, which scale based on how much you exceed by. It is quite possible to make and exceptional ship that goes over its constraint limits but is generally something you'll want to avoid.\n\noverall - lots and lots of details, this can be very overwhelming but a solid basic setup will still perform well and doesn't need to be overanalyzed when starting out. I personally love the level of detail that can go into ship building but this can be a negative as well for some players\n\n\nControls:\n\nPersonally I found the default mouse and keyboard controls to be a bit awkward at first, after getting used to them a bit it worked very well, but I did end up changing them so I would conflict too much with other games I play as switching back and forth between control schemes with some similarities was more trouble then it was worth to me, but with a few minor adjustments it works great. Also there's word that the new version (incoming fairly soon) will have altered default controls to match up more closely with more commong Mouse+keyboard schemes players may be familiar with. And although I don't have access to a setup regularly the game is a blast with a good joystick.\n\nThere are a wide variety of built in maneuvers available to the player and they're flexible enough to be used in a very wide variety of ways to create some pretty crazy maneuvers.\n\noverall - Has a significant learning curve but I feel the controls are solid, and offer enough options and flexibility to create a good non-restrictive experience\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game itself currently consists of two teams fighting to destroy eachothers carriers, it has Moba style objectives where killing the oposing team players does offer and advantage but if not capitalized on doesn't garuntee anything.\n\nCurrently there is one map with several new ones reportedly coming in the next update, however I'd also like to add that the map is varied and balanced enough that with the way the game plays I would say that this is not a problem.\n\nDogfighting is important but as above with kills is not anywhere near the end all of how to win or even play. Ultimately the carrier is what matters and your ability to either stop the enemies attack force or simply outdo their offense with your own will determine the match. Additionally carriers have a main cannon that will periodically fire at eachother creating a limit to how long a match can last, with a draw being determined by either most gunship kills (a players main ship) or additionally the teams overall score if kills were even as well.\n\nThe carrier has several destroyable parts such as a radar, repair station, shield generator, which when destroyed inflicts a different penalty on the opposing team as well as suffering damage to their overall carrier integrity. This allows for many different approaches on how to take out the carrier, from going for surprise attacks on undefended parts, crippling the enemies ability to resupply and radar range, or even going for maximum carrier damage by stripping its defenses.\n\nIt's also important to note that players themselves can be harder to destroy than might be expected, often requiring at least two players to garuntee a kill before an experienced player can escape to relative safety, however losing a ship can be a major loss to a team or individual, as a lost gunship is permanently out for the rest of the match. A player is allowed to bring two seperate gunships into a match and they may not have any overlapping parts (with 4 different races to pick from even building two ships for similar roles and performance is quite doable), and a lost ship is replaced with a standard drong ship for that race, which are generally weak stat wise but cannot be ignored as they can still turn the tide of a battle as well as not costing the team any points towars a tiebreaker if the drone is destroyed as it will respawn. Also players are allowed to request to share ships with another of their teammates giving both players free access to eachothers ships for the rest of the match, altho the rules for losing ships remain even if another player is piloting one of your ships.\n\noverall - a unique game with a focus more on team objectives than a straight forwards deathmatch. There is as much place on a team for a player who wants only to shoot down enemy fighters as well as a player who wants to focus solely on bombing the carrier. Survival is also quite important as you may lose an edge with too many gunships lost, but kills alone don't decide the match and a team can lose many more ships than the opponent and still come out significantly on top.\n\n\n\nFinal notes, again at the time of writing this there is an update incoming and reportedly shortly after this game will be available for a free weekend so if this interests you at all, keep an eye out.","October 17, 2014","true","51.1"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

But since it's a PvP game, that can only mean they're playing it wrong. It's a more old-school game where you need to construct your ship with some goal in mind, formulate a plan on the fly to fulfill that goal, and execute it with only your balls and your brain. So far, the game has had a smooth launch - compared to most other games we've been seeing - and the few bugs it has are easily worked around. It's exquisitely balanced. It's gratifying to see devs who obviously spent way more time honing gameplay than polishing pointless bits and bobs to make it look 'nice' while playing like crap. Sure, it's rough, but it runs smooth in all the right places. It renews my faith in game devs to see this game launch with such well-tuned, challenging, rewarding gameplay. So - you want gameplay? This game is all about gameplay. You want teamwork? This game requires it. You want just the right amount of mechanics to make strategy worthwhile? GoD Factory has that too. It's well-balanced, fine-tuned, and a heck of a lot of fun. I have not had this much fun in a PvP game since I was playing mods for Half-Life. The negative reviews on this game are more of a reflection on the incompetence of this generation of gamers more than the game itself.","August 31, 2014","true","11.7"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaads/recommended/262750/","Kaads","Jim","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Kaads/","668 products in account","This game is confusing to play. It is also seemingly designed to be hostile to new players.\n\nWhen you start, you are instructed to select two of the four starting ships solely based on a text description with no idea on how they operate in an actual game.\nThe starting ships also start without a secondary ability, but you have one in the tutorial. So new players are penalised for joining a game without trying to navigate the equip / buy menus.\nIt would be better if new players got four fully kitted out ships at game start so they can experiment with which ones the actually want to fly.\n\nBad/New players are further penalised by the respawn system. If one of your two main ships die, you have to use a low quality drone ship in it's place for the rest of the up to 21 minute match. Imagine if in dota, when your hero died you had to play as a creep for the rest of the game. That is what happens here.\n\nIt's difficult to figure out where all the players are. You seemly can't see enemies that are outside your personal detection range except as small dots on a minimap where is a hard to even see where you are, which makes intuitive team co-ordination harder. When you are attacking the enemy carrier, its hard to tell what is attacking you, a turret or an enemy player(s). It's hard to tell what you are being hit by at any time, your only clues are 1. your health is depleting 2. Sounds are happening. The general lack of information makes it hard to decide what to do at any given moment.\n\nThe game needs a 'simple' mode that new players start off on. Featuring smaller capitol ships without internal components, less attackable components and easy to access / multiple hangers so it's easier to navigate. And you main ships respawn after a minute or so, so you don't get stuck with drones a few minutes into the game.\n\nAlso, the ship customisation is really not something to be excited about. The only interesting parts are the two abilities you can choose and the two to three weapons you can equip. There are also another 6+ parts like 'thrusters' that change a bunch of numbers. It would be better if you just picked the ship, abilities, and weapons.\nAlso, new players are penalised by the 'Grade' system where you can level up your parts to get better parts, so older players have better ships and more experience at playing the game.\nAlso there are no tooltips in the shop, so you have to enter each weapons screen to figure out what is does instead of waving your mouse over the icons.\n\nThe quick join button isn't 'quick'. Quick play sends you to a random game, where you have to then set yourself onto a team, wait for players to ready up and then the host has to be awake to start the game. It would be great if a queue system was implemented, where it automatically places players together and starts the game.\n\nIt's probably a great game for premade teams that setup skype that have unlocked all the ship parts, but that's probably going to a small % of any player base, it doesn't make sense to design any game to them first.\n\nThe art style and music are great. I would really like the play a game that controlled and looked like this that wasn't a team based dota-like.","September 1, 2014","false","1.5"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

It was this title that won out over several others I own.  The ships themselves are so unique in design, and the environment is very immersive.  As far as gameplay, I find it quite engaging.  As I have not played the game extensively yet, I cannot provide an in-depth review of every aspect.  Nonetheless, considering price and content, I highly recommend this title to fans of space combat.\n\nMy only complaint is that the game can be a bit confusing and things are not always intuitive.  Having stated that, when I requested assistance through the company's "Contact Us" address, I received an accurate and helpful response within less than an hour!  The developers are very engaged and support their product fully, a product they should be in my opinion, very proud of!\n\nUpdate 01/20/1016: After almost 100 hours into this game, I can definitely rates as one of my favorite space combat games by far.

After watching a couple of vids, pre-ordered it on the spot.  I've never done a review on Steam before, but I really wanted to put in my two cents about this game.  Here it goes:\n\nFirst here is a description of what the game actually is:  Online Team-based PvP Multiplayer,  Online Team-Based bot Multiplayer,   There is only one map currently, only one game-type currently (Take out their carrier before they take out yours), 4 different classes of ships (Glass cannon, Support, Bomber/bruiser, Tank/Support), progression system similar to that of Warframe (Leveling up ship components levels up your pilot rank, leveling up your pilot rank unlocks new ship components), High octane space-combat.\n\n[6-10] Pros:\n\n[8] Graphics quality:  While this is no Star Citizen, the games looks absolutely beautiful without being too demanding on my rig.\n\n[9] Art-style: I love this game's art-style.  It feels like Zone of the Enders meets Wildstar. To my knowledge, their is no space sim currently out or in development with this style.  It's a refreshing add to the genre.\n\n[7] Progression System: The model they used is an excellent progression system in my opinion.  Fight to earn XP-->XP levels up your ship components-->level up your ship components to get Pilot Rank XP-->Ranking up unlocks ship components-->buy and equip your new components-->Fight to earn XP.\n\n[8] Gameplay:  This game is fun to play.  The combat has that "ZING".  You feel your thrusters ripping your ship through space.     You feel your munitions slamming into your opponent's hull.\n\n[10] Tutorial quality/Learning Curve:  Not too steep of a learning curve.  The devs have included a nice tutorial, which awards you with in-game credits for each peice you complete. After completing the tutorial, you will not only know how to control that space ripping flight we talked about earlier, but you will also have enough credits to buy all the components needed to build an entire ship.\n\n[7] Price:  The game is $20.  If you pre-ordered it, you got 2 copies for $20.  Maybe the devs could have given us one or two more maps, but even though they didn't, I would say the game is worth the $20.\n\nOculus Rift support:  I can't rate this portion because I don't have a Rift dev kit, but I felt like the fact that it has the support needed to be mentioned.\n\n[1-5] Cons:\n\n[1] Depth:  This game does not have much depth.  There is one game-type, and there is one map.  There is no single player compaign.  Can't see myself playing this game longer than a week or two before I put it down for a while.\n\n[4] Match time: Because each team's carrier is attacking the other throughout the match,  each match will last only a maximum of 25 minutes.   In my experience, most matches are done in ~10 minutes.  At the end of most matches, I don't feel like I got enoughy time in the game to satisfy me.\n\n[7.5] Overall:  I nerded out and dropped 20 hours into this puppy in two days.  I will probably toss another 10 hours at it over the next day or so.  Unfortunately, the game isn't going to keep me going for much longer.  Hopefully the devs will come out with some new content in the near future.","August 31, 2014","true","51.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Newer players who get too giddy need to take the time and explore the hanger and shop. Dear GoD do the tutorials!\n2> The UI could use some overhaul to give a little more clarity to stat affects or bonuses.\n3> No such thing as "dog fighting" mode (I can understand it as it would turn it into a different game)\n4> Attempting to add friends can be a bit wonky\n5> Too many people complaining about losing a ship and quitting\n\nLong Version\n\nI have been playing GoD factory since it has come out and all I can say is I have found an arcade space alien(ish) style shooter I can enjoy playing. It does a good job of giving you hints as to how to play , but sometimes it can be a little daunting until you play your first match where you will die. Not a little, but a lot and if its not someone killing you then its you hitting your ship getting lost. You can save yourself a little time by doing a couple bot matches just to get yourself warmed up to the games controls, but your first real game with other players is goign to be where you really learn. Customizing your ship feels weird at first only because the game does not exactly tell you that your build is bad until you exceed one of your resources. I personally dont find this as a problem, but maybe the dev team should think about adding in a feature that shows you how to customize AND buy. I know it sounds like a lot of hand holding, but some information is better than none in some cases.\n\nMy numer one complaint about this game is the amount of complaining from people when they break their ships and then ask to use yours in under 5 minutes.

Needs More.... People.\n\nThis is quite a Stratigic game. To win you have to destroy your enemy's carrier (The Big ship). To lose... just let them destroy your carrier (the Big ship you spawn on). Simple right? Wrong!\n\nThe Ship is made up of various parts such as: Forcefield generator; Radar; Ammo Depot; ETC.\nDestroying any of these will inflict varied pain on the enemy team. on top of that some maps have special points such as healing stations that can be captured so that you do not have to retreat all the way back to your ship to heal.\n\nAs far as gameplay related to other space fight games I can't tell you much as the only other game like this one that i have played is Star Fox: Assault (Yes I know thats a Bad Comparision but its my only one)\n\nFlight is slightly complex with you controling  4 dimesions of basic manuevering and a few special manuevers (180 flips, drifting, ETC.)\n\nfrom what i have noticed the matches will be quicker as you upgrade your gunship (or exosuit) because you can easily do more damage to the enemy's Carrier.\n\nOne thing Ilove about this game is the customisation you can do to your ships. Tweaking this or that to make it just what you desire.\n\nTHE ONLY CON SO FAR\n\nplayer base appears to be under 10 people\n\nBUT>>>> this con can be fixed.

Spaceships combat 4v4 with the objective of destroying enemy's base. 4 different races and great customization, you can only choose 2 basic ships in the beginning but while you rank up and you'll be able to buy different parts for your ships or even create others and mix pieces of different races in order to create your personal ship. Controls are not very familiars but with a bit of pratice you can master your ship quite well and even make some kill. This game is not meant to be a pure Fps, so strategy is required and much collaboration. There's only one map but i think that they will be added as soon as population grows up and shows interest. Maybe playing many hours alone could get boring btw if you have some friend and you can play together and coordinate your attacks this game gets really awesome and i recommend it.

First off, customization is good, right? Only problem is, if your ship gets destroyed ONCE, it's gone for the rest of the long round, which is really discouraging.\n\nAs for smooth game running, it's ok, but if you can play Dota 2 at max settings and still get 30+ FPS, then you can definately play this game smoothly. If otherwise, you'll get some FPS lag spikes. And these spikes can really affect your gameplay.\n\nThe tutorial is ok, but it really just juts out all the information at your in sections. I mean, in practice, you'll get used to them.\n\nThe gameplay, though, is pretty neat. EVERY weapon locks onto your enemies (from what I've seen so far) because we all know that precise aiming can be pretty hard sometimes, especially in giant 3D fast-paced maps.\n\nOnce more people start playing this game, it'll be MUCH more multiplayer based, but at the moment it's just bots because of the lack of people playing.\n\nDispite the bad things, this game still has some great potential. I definately recommend it to people who like (sorta) MMO, customization, space-themed, and fast-paced games such as myself.","October 14, 2014","true","4.3"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It's very remiscent of the last Star Fox game except online. Although you do have the option to play with just bots in practice matches, however you still level up in these although I'm not sure if the rate is lower or not.\n\nControls: I'm not used to have a multitude of buttons to press to be effective let's be real here most set ups use a few schemes and that's it. Get that notion out of your head every single button on your gamepad you WILL be using. With that being said it can get and feel very hectic.\n\nGraphics: Nothing cutting edge but pretty and does it's job. Wish the explosions were a bit more there, this is no Star Citizen but then again it doesn't aim to be.\n\nMusic: After a few matches I just lowered the music volume and threw up my Zune software to listen to music whilst being murdered by those better than me.\n\nGameplay: It's a 4 on 4 match with the objective of destroying the opponents Ship. There are numerous ways to do this by taking out certain parts of the enemies ship. Again even if those of you that aren't all that great there are smaller things that you can take care of: Your team want to go for the generator? Go take out those pesky guns that damage them while they go do their thing.\n\nCustomization: Good lord it's pretty deep for the pricetag at least in my opinion. Different color pallettes, each Gun/Weapon/Missle has 5 different Mastery levels that you'll invest into with both credits and the usual using of the weapon.\n\nBalance: Not sure on this front; I've only played a few public games and everything seemed balanced besides the teams themselves usually see a team at 70% vs 40% which is the indicator of the 'weight' of the team.\n\nAll in all the game is definately wirth the 20.00 now enough about the review time to jump back in the game.","August 31, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Some complaints I've noticed seem to be that you NEED a joystick for the game, but that simply isn't the case. I absolutely sucked at flying in the X franchise, and even the Star Trek games on PS1, but even I've grasped a lot of the flight controls enough to play well on this game. It doesn't detract from the game for anyone who's familar with 6DOF games whatsoever.\n\nReally love how the matches play out and I think it has a lot of potential for small groups of friends, it's one hell of a LAN party game.\n\nFor those who like some meat and depth to the tactical side of their dogfighting sims, this DOES have it. I personally think that the damage types and combos page of the wiki is a good example of this, check it out: http://god-factory-wingmen.wikia.com/wiki/Damage_Types\n\nHell yeah I reccomend this game!\n\nDrawbacks -\n\nI was hoping for Armoured Core style parts and ship customisation, but I don't think theres as many parts as I would have liked to see. I do think it's awesome that each part has an actual model, as I hate games that offer 100's of items that all look the same, but a little bit more variety would really help draw in more contested ship building between players.","August 31, 2014","true","7.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Input friendly, can use multiple inputs at the same time (mouse, keyboard, joystick, footpads, you name it).\n\n-Gameplay is solid and fast paced, with a wide variety of ships to choose from. You can customize ships from a good variety of weapons, wings, and hulls among 4 races. Long range snipers, stealth bombers, close quarters tanky ships, and interceptors are all very possible to build. Some races and hulls favor other roles above others.\n\n- 4v4 PVP or with bots, always a nice option for more relaxing gameplay or getting the hang of the map.\n\nCons: to me, the "manuvers" and boost cheapen the whole dogfighting experience. Any ship can do an almost instantaneous flip, which turns a good portion of fights into "streak past them and flip around and shoot them and boost away to go repair".\n\n-Only 1 map, with 1 game mode.

I would suggest playing about 4 games, take a break, continue another 4, then take a break again. Rinse and repeat. If you go more than that, it becomes quite repititive.\n\nOn the other hand, the controls need some getting used to for the keyboard and mouse. My first and second game went horribly due to flying issues. But after that, I actually loved the flying. It was challenging and you have to pay attention to the mini map WHILE making sure you don't ram into debris. If you love challenges, this is the game for you.\n\nCustomisation in this game is fantastic. Graphics are brilliant even on medium. I have yet to try low. I like the unlocking credits and colours through achievements. I find this concept smart. A sense of reward for the players, make them feel like it is worth hunting achievements unlike other games.\n\nYou absolutely, and I mean ABSOLUTELY ... cannot solo. Unless you outlevel everyone else by what?  3 levels? I dunno. Not very fun smashing newbies unless you need a serious boost in ego.\n\nThe community is quite friendly surprisingly...

If you have played Strike Vector, you'll be right at home, but with a major difference; your objective is not to merely kill the opposite team but to destroy their large Carrier Ship before they destroy yours.\n\nThere are many parts to each of the Carrier Ship on both teams, each part brings along with it a penalty if it is let destroyed by the opponent.  For example, the enemy team will have 30% less ammo capacity if you destroy their Ammo Warehouse.\n\nThis is a small game, with only 1 map and 1 game mode, but what really set this game above others is the level of customization for your ships.  If you are a fan of mech games like Mech Warrior, you will enjoy the level of customization here.  For newer players, perhaps building the ship is as easy as putting the highest rank parts they can on their fighter, but as you play more you will find additional challenges on balancing the ship as merely adding high level parts will not only put your ship overweight, overheat, or over energy consumption, but your ship will also lack focus in their role on the team.\n\nThis is a game that I highly recommend to give a try if you enjoy space ship customization - did I mention that the graphics are very nice and that the details on each ship part is very cool looking?  also it has a very nice cosmetic colouring system.  At the moment of this review, the game's player base is a bit low, going up to a peak of 100 or so players at night more me (EST).  But unless people take an interest in the game and try it out this game would not fly.\n\nAll in all, I really recommend this game, but if the price is too steep for 1 game mode and 1 map, I would suggest putting it on your wish list and wait for a deal, this is a very under appreciated and under populated game.","September 11, 2014","true","74.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Fast action, but with only one play mode for now. You have different parts you can install, and they all give different levels of pros and cons to the overall craft. The mechanics are pretty easy to translate if you have played anything like Armored Core, Chromehounds, or HAWKEN in the past. Again, so far, I am having a lot of fun with it, and I'd give it a green light if you like games liek the previously mentioned.\n\nVisuals: The game is only about 800MB in size, so they spent more time on mechanics than actual graphics, which are still pleasing, and at the same time, not overly flashy. The game is both TPS and FPS depending on preference, with which both are aesthetically pleasing.\n\nI'd give it a 7-10 for a game that is within the $20 range.\n\nAudio: Surprise surprise, the soundtrack is fast paced, and engaging. I really enjoy hanging out in the menus, just listening to the ambiance while upgrading a new part to the Mark II or Mark III versions. And in combat, the music is neither distracting, nor does it take away from the gameplay. I really dig the tracks, and I think anybody that plays arcade games or sims will enjoy it.\n\nI will give this a 8-10 for a game within the $20 range, and much praise for what that $20 buys you.\n\nGameplay: So the AI isn't the smartest, or super adaptive as the AAA titles (Joke much?) But the game applies some serious power to the bots if you don't have a complete 4 V 4 match with PCs. The controls have a slight learning curve, but with the choice of flightstick, X360 gamepad and Keyboard/mouse, coupled with the intergration of the Oculus Rift support, you can have a blast at your own speed. YOu really need to learn the tricks to survive very long out there.\n\nI give the game a 7-10 for the learning curve, but once you get past it, sensitivity is adjustable to suit you.\n\n\nOverall score: All things considered, I am going to give GoD Factory: Wingmen a 7.6 out of 10. The price is right where it needs to be. The gameplay isn't overbearing, and it's intuitive with the choice in multiple input preferences. Audio is spot on for a game that cost's you $20, which brings depth to the game, and with 7:1 audio, the firefights are pleasing. The game gives you paint schemes and in-game credits for completing achievements, and tutorials, which prods yout o want to get that one extra takedown. So far, the game has no mod support, nor Trading Cards, which bumped the score a little, but still. Very satisfying, good way to kill some time. Go get it!\n\n\nBe sure to check out my Youtube for more of this review!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E37kygtNM3c&list=UU0mgxbP8AWLcgsCLy3yPvWQ","August 31, 2014","true","11.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Destroying an enemy’s carrier involves taking out key components each of which have a certain effect on your opponents team when destroyed, ergo choosing the right areas to go after is key and will vary from match to match depending on your team and opponents.  Each component (except the core) is worth one health point (two for the core), additionally every three minutes the carriers main guns will fire reducing your opponents health points by one. Provided you get into a well balanced match (see below) this game mode is deep enough and challenging enough that it does not get stale, so while additional game modes would be appreciated (and I hope being worked on) the existing mode is good enough that it will offer many hours of gameplay.\n\nShips and components are generally very hard to take down and (with some exceptions) can be repaired or will regenerate. Each player starts the game with two gunships (only one can be active at a time) of their own design, however each gunship has only one life. If you lose a gunship it is replaced with a low level drone which can be used instead, and each time you die you have an increasingly long respawn. The combination of these penalties encourages a hit and run style gameplay that focuses on preserving your ships (a refreshing change from many games which have little to no penalty for dying) and makes taking out an opponents gunship a potential game changer.\nCo-ordination is achieved by using an action wheel style system which tends to work better than trying to type in commands in chat and has options for attacking or defending all major components of the carriers. While those using voice chat will still have some advantage you can generally co-ordinate with a group of other players enough that you stand a fighting chance regardless.\n\nShip creation uses a parts system. There are 4 distinct races (in terms of abilities, general stats and gameplay roles) with different primary abilities and ship components. There are 12-13 key components (depending on if you have one or two wing weapons) and each of these has at least 3 components (generally more) and some of these can be shared between the races. Each component has a further 4 ranks that can be unlocked (each generally a straight upgrade on the last), leading to a large number of possible configurations. Generally speaking there aren’t many cases of a part simply being better than another (there are a few notable exceptions) so its not simply a race to get parts higher on the tech tree, a part low on the tech tree is still likely to have benefits over a higher item on the tech tree at the same rank. Regardless of this parts are generally easy to unlock (both in terms of credits and experience) and at 17 hours of gameplay I have unlocked a large number of parts, including the ace level parts, the resistance is about right to keep you wanting to unlock more components but not so slow that you feel like your grinding.\n\nThis games major downfall is in the matchmaking and balancing. Each ship you build is given a class, higher classes are generally better than lower ones (plus or minus some allowance for build methodology). When you drop into a lobby the classes of all players ships are displayed along with a balance indicator for each team (based on the combined score of each players ship classes), unfortunately at the time of writing that’s it, 7 of you playing with class one and two ships and someone drops in with two class 8’s, not much you can do other than kick them from the match. The game does not seem to account for a players highest ship class nor does it allow you to search for high or low level matches, so it is normal for high level players to drop in with low level players, which even if the teams can be balanced will end with the lowest level players being made into mincemeat (not much fun). As a work around to getting face rolled by ace level pilots you can play matches against AI’s for money and XP until you are at a reasonable tech level but it’s not an ideal solution. It does seem however that this would be relatively easy to fix and I hope it is presently being worked on.\n\nThere are occasional crashes and bugs to be contended with, but this close to launch that was to be expected, there aren’t a lot of game breaking bugs (other than a crash on load glitch that one of my friends encountered but a quick look at the forum found an easy workaround). Every now and then you may have to restart the game due to the game freezing or an issue with the in game store not correctly debiting your credits correct (the Database Error glitch). None of these should discourage you from buying the game as they are about on par with what would be expected of all games close to release.\n\nThe game in its current state is really worth the $20 odd dollar price tag, its minor downfalls are exactly that: minor, and easily corrected. All of which are overshadowed by well thought out gameplay, good balancing and reasonable progression.\n\nSee you in my crosshairs\n-Fallingdreamer.","September 3, 2014","true","21.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Namely, their release method.\n\nBecause GOD Factory was marketed as a full release and was recieved with the same expectations, the vast majority of the gamer base lasted a grand total of 1 week.  This is in part to the game breaking drop bug, as well as the single map/game mentioned in my original post.  With no replayability and complete loss of confidence, the average size you can expect to see playing the game at any one time is around 20-40 players.  This makes it difficult to get a good match going without having to resort to bots.\n\nWith such great mechanics and graphics, it's a shame that this game failed so hard.  From a developer standpoint, i think it would be great if they could continue to recieve the support they need to make a truly great game, but from a player/buyer standpoint, I don't think they're taking this anywhere soon and thus it isn't worth the buy.\n\nPrevious:\nGiven that this game is advertised as a final product/full release, I definitely do not recommend the game AT THIS TIME!\n\nPrimary Reason:  The game is basically incapable of going more than two matches without dropping players from a match, turning a decent game of 4v4 into a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ game of chance wondering which team will be down a man in 5 minutes.\n\nWith the frequent crashes and drops, not to mention the SINGLE map and match type, this game barely even qualifies as a beta, and i certainly regret paying $20 for it.  Though that's more because it decietfully advertised as a full release.\n\nIf the drops could be fixed and at the very least more maps/carriers are implemented to keep the game interesting, then absolutely buy this game.\n\nHere's why.  The customization options are incredible, as well as the way the parts are unlocked.  In some cases, yes parts you get later are better, but that's not true for all of them.  For example a human level 1 part still serves as the best bomber component in the game.  You do work to get up to higher tiers on any given part, but a few matches in and you're there.  Basically it's a trial run on lower levels and reduced cost to see if you even want to invest in a new component.\n\nNot only do the parts' abilities differ, but there's a visible difference on the ship you place, which affects the tight areas you can fly through or crash into.  The color's also turned out to be a nice feature as sometimes you want to hide against the dark background or look big and shiny so people try to avoid you.\n\nThe controls are amazing, though you may want to alter the default mouse/keyboard bindings.  Handling does actually make a noticable difference in how sharp you can turn.  The weapon types have different visuals and effects, and teamwork is encouraged by the very nature of the damage they do.\n\nWhen a ship dies, it's gone for the match and replaced with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ drone.  Personally I think that's awesome as it encourages you to play a bit more tactfully and try to get your ships out of a sticky situation alive.  Otherwise it would simply be suicide mission one after the next.  Even after you get drones, you are still disuaded from this tactic as the respawn time continues to grow.\n\nAmmo is a bit small, especially for an attacking ship supporting bombers, and requires frequent trips back to the docking bay.  I understand the necessity of it though as it keeps the ships swarming around and not breaking off into small clusters throughout the match.\n\nAll in all, a decent concept when it's playable, but for now i stick by my recommendation.  Don't buy this game until they fix the connection issues.","September 1, 2014","false","20.6"," 10 of 22 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","10","22","0","0"

You need to grind to unlock ship parts and you need to grind to upgrade them. And you will need to - ship stats DO matter in this game a lot, One can spend most of the ammo reserves and still barely scratch the enemy if level disparity is high enough.\nSpeaking of level disparity - this game lacks even the most basic matchmaking system. I have regularly seen matches with coordinated teams of lvl 7-8 ships vs random new players with default ships.

Going into battle, getting better parts for ship, then go into battle stronger.   The game has two teams pitched against each other.  The point of the game is to destroy the opposite team member's mothership.  The mechanics, the graphics and the game's pitch are very good (again.. in theory).  What ultimately drove me to give a negative review to this game is the ship controls.  I am currently using a mouse and keyboard and it is very hard to do anything meaningful with any of the ships.  Compound this with extremely fast action and you get lost very fast.   To top it off, you are looking for certain parts on the mothership to disable to deny the enemy from certain benefits (like the ability to scan you from afar), you get there and you shoot and you shoot.. but... you can't completely stop the ship (I understand inertia in space - but there is no option to go in reverse so that I can either stop or go back) eventually leading your ship into the hull of the mothership.  It seems the developers spent a good deal of time creating this game but ultimately it is the gameplay that makes a game and like I said before unfortunately the game controls killed this game for me.","August 30, 2014","false","1.8"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","9","21","0","5"

You have to wait literally 30 minutes to play a match it is crazy!!! I finally got into a match and got kicked and said screw this. I waited quite a while to play this game finally bought it and im still not able to play it because the lobby is awful. I did play through the tutorial and it was amazing the playing that i did do in the turtorial was great i just wish i could actually play the real game but i dont have 30 minutes to sit and wait for a match then get kicked and wait another 30 minutes.\n--------------------------------------Edit\nSo i finally got into a match and this game is not what i thought it was at all. I thought this game was a dogfighting space game and it is not that at all. The objective of the game is to destroy the enemy base seems simple enought but it is not. You fly out into space and you have no real idea what is going on and you fly to the enemy base and just shoot at it that is the point to this game. I thought there would be much more to it but that is it. There really is no explanation of how to play the game i went thru the tutorials but they dont tell me anything about the enemy base and how to destroy it but the whole entire concept of the game is quite boring though. I feel like the developers of this game are not marketing it the way they should. They market it as a dog fight style space game but that is not what it is at all. You fly out into space and shoot at the enemy base. I thought this game was a arena type dog fight game but it is not it. The thing is i have been really excited about playing this game. I first saw it on youtube in a video about pax. The footage of the game looked incredible dont get me wrong the spaceship design is cool and the flying is great but the game is not .","November 20, 2014","false","1.2"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","0"

Good progression curve on both ship design and strategy.

The only problem is the usual problem with mutliplayer games; there isn't much of an active player base right now.","April 29, 2015","true","6.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My Thrustmaster T.Flight Hotas was only recognized during the configuration, and no axis worked during the game. It worked one time after i went in calibration option.\n\nAfter the first disappointment, i tried to play with x360 controller : same thing. No Axis... Gived up !\n\nAnd my friend could not configure its x55 hotas neither...","May 4, 2015","false","1.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
