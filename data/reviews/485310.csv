So if you can wait updates and players, don2t wait. Buy now.\n\nBut, maybe you can't play now because game need some advertisments to catch players, and game is mo fps so you can't play yourself.\n\nMy point to game is 7/10. If we think game is in early development this point is good.\n\nHave a nice days ...\n\nIf you want to play game, please buy with your friends ...","June 3","true","3.5"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","14","25","2","2"
