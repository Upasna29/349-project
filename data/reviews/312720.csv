And just when you think youve got it nailed and youve won, a simple turn of a piece ruins everything for you. Im hoping more people purchase this so you can get into online games instantly.\n\nThere are varying starting layouts for the pieces or you can go random. The rules are pretty simple but as always in a game like this well worth reading them.\n\nTheres not a lot more to say really, If you love logic and puzzle games, enjoy having gray hair a little  sooner than you should then buy it! be sure to send me a online match request >:) ( chess players will probably love this game )\n\nThe only thing i think could have made a drastic improvemment is a chatbox in game rather than having to chat through steam which pauses the game.","October 1, 2014","true","2.8"," 53 of 55 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","53","55","0","0"

Of course, not only can you not make illegal moves, but this copy comes with a handy instructional that can get you playing the game in about three minutes.\nThis is a tactical, one move at a time, game that takes strategy into account if you want to win. So, while you may be playing in three minutes, you'll have a little time to learn how to best play the game.\n\nThis game has local multiplayer!!! I was pleasantly surprised to see this since it is not currently listed on the Steam store page.\n\nMy game defaulted to a lower graphics quality, which was still OK, but after I went into the settings menu, I increased the quality to a pleasant to look at quality like the screenshots here on Steam.\n\nIf you know the board game then you know what this is about. But if not, take a quick look at the video or YouTube to see if you want a turn-based, chess-like, tactical board game. Personally, I am enjoying it, and like the game play.\n\nFor The Developer: I do wish that you would add a "view reset" to the "right stick click" on the XBox 360 controller to bring the view back to top dead center...a view reset, if you will. It can really help in a multiplayer game when the opponent moves the camera to a crazy position!","October 6, 2014","true","6.3"," 24 of 25 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","24","25","0","1"

When I found it on steam I had to snag a copy! It's a deceptively simple game and great to play with a friend, casual matches are maybe twenty minutes in length.\n\nThe digital implementation of the actual boardgame is straightforward and decently done. Legal moves are shown when picking up any piece, and the last moved piece for both players receives a gold-tint as a helpful reminder. The game includes the Classic, Dynasty, and Imhotep starting layouts. The AI has five setting levels, and should make for a great warmup and introduction to the game's abilities before playing against another person.\n\nI would recommend this game if picked up on a sale, the default price is a bit much even as a 2-pack. This is compounded by the fact that the Eye of Horus addition to Khet is a seperate DLC and is not included in the base game. The Eye of Horus beam splitter is a must-have piece for some real fun playing Khet, so make sure to snag both during a sale!","June 23, 2015","true","4.6"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","1"

The rules are deceptively simple. There are only a few kinds of pieces. It is "turn-based" so the speed and accuracy of my movements are irrelevant.\n\nIt also stretches the mind in ways that echo chess or go. You can learn the basics quickly, but it would take a while to become "a master player." "Deceptively simple and delightfully complex" sounds about right to me.\n\nThis is not the game for everyone. I highly recommend it for people whose taste in games is "deceptively simple and delightfully complex."","March 12, 2015","true","47.6"," 15 of 15 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","15","15","0","1"

Great Job!\n\nThis is a great game.  As a big fan of Go (igo, Baduk, etc.) this has a good number of qualities of the go game.  First, its rules are simple. Movement of pieces is very simple and can be understood very quickly.  The format of the game is quite logical and without reading the rules, it only took one or two games to understand all the movement and basic strategy of the game. Second, it has some depth to the game play.  It is not so simple to have standard moves (at least not for me yet), though it may at some point for me in the future.  The good thing is that there is a bit of repeatibility in play because of the different setups for the board.\nI have played on all three board types and I can now definitely say that this game has a good future.  The other board types are quite challenging compared to the first, and the strategy definitely has to change for each board type.  That makes it a bit more interesting since there may be even more unique ways to play in the future.\n\nI am quite happy with this game. It mixes the qualities of Chess with go by adopting the simplicity of go, but the faster pace of chess and removal of pieces off the board.  With the rating system, I am also looking forward to playing online at some point.\n\nI should also note, having now played the game a bit and beaten the computer AI on Hard level, the pace is not too slow.  Many times when you get into the harder levels, the AI slows considerably.  One of the things I like about this game is that it has a relatively quick pace (can finish a game within 20 minutes easily), and it still maintains some interesting depth.  I assume the elite and impossible levels will get even slower, though.  It is good to maintain a reasonable pace, and I hope the advanced AI games can still finish within an hour.\n\nOnce I play some online games, I will again, update this review.","October 13, 2014","true","3.9"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

It's a fancy and fun twist on the popular 'Chess" game and much easier to learn and the game typically moves a lot faster as well.\n\nReminds me a LOT of a type-in game from the old COMPUTE! magazine back in the 1980s called Laser Chess!  And ohhh did I love that game back then.  So a modern day "Laser Chess" I wondered when I saw this.. I HAD to buy it.  And I am glad I did!\n\nIs it a great game for everyone?  Absolutely NOT!\n\nI can see a good number of people being bored out of their mind with this game, however if you are one who likes games like Backgammon, Freecell, Chess, and Checkers, then chances are good you'll love this game and think it's worth every penny.\n\nAction game lover?

Very comparable to chess in complexity and learning curve. Other similarities include gambits, discovered attacks, as well as crucial openings.

I liked the Egyptian theme, and am a huge fan of more abstract puzzle-style games such as chess, Go, and Hive. I bought Khet on a whim when I saw that it had support for Linux, and have had a huge amount of fun playing it.\n\nThe game is very easy to pick up, and you quickly get drawn into plotting out future moves and paths. I very quickly beat the AI on the lowest two levels, but have yet to take on the higher skill levels.\n\nThe client itself, from the same developer as the also-excellent Hive, is very well done. I'd add a slight wish for keyboard controls that don't rely on the number pad, to support us laptop users, but that's a very minor complaint.\n\nAll in all, a well-written version of a very fun game, at a low price.

If you like chess and other strategy board games, you will most certainly like Khet. Unfortunately, this digital version of the game leaves a lot to be desired. The game is very buggy, and crashed multiple times when I was trying to play an online game with a friend. Good news is, that my friend submitted error logs to the developer and he fixed most problems within a day. But there are still some lagging issues. For one, the game will always crash if you have a browser window open that is playing video such as Netflix or Amazon Video. Also, the interface is not very good. Almost every digital version of chess that's ever been released has allowed players to scroll through all the moves made in the game. This is incredibly useful when you are playing an asyncronous game, and you need to refresh your memory on what the last several moves were. This is a feature that is sorely needed in Khet. Even if you are playing a live game and you happen to look away from the screen for a second while your opponent moves, it can be extrememly difficult to try and figure out where he just moved, and there's no way to click back and see. Overall though, I do recommend this game, simply because Khet is such a deep and interesting game. And hopefully in the future, the interface can be fixed with an update. As of January 2016, I would give this game a 6/10. With some interface tweaks and bug fixes, this game would easily be a 10/10.","January 27","true","8.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Khet 2.0 is a thinking mans strategic board game and plays very similar to Laser Chess, but also has elements akin to the 3000 year old game Go. The concept of Khet is somewhat similar to chess: destroy your enemy's Pharaoh with your Sphinx Laser via positioning and strategy, while protecting your own as he does the same.\n\nThe simple principles make for just as much memorization, logic and planning as Chess, but they reduce the emphasis on knowing moves, and as a result tend to make on-the-fly strategy a bit more open and accessible. Overall, Khet was perfect for me because as much as I love battling wits in Chess, I rarely have the time or patience for it and Khet 2.0 offers much faster games for those looking for them, but also offers support for asynchronous play, so I'm never hurried or rushed to make a move when I want to take my time or play casually.\n\nHighlights\nThe gameplay and fun of Khet comes down to pitting wits against friends, opponents or AI and approaching a win while mavourering an attack and simultaneously paying attention to defense and if you like the idea of an arguably simpler chess, it's an easy sell. What really matters for Khet 2.0 is the development team and how well they bring the concept to Steam. While there are technical issues and small problems with the title, the Development team are pretty committed and regularly post updates, bugfixes and more and despite flaws, the multiplayer platform is overall solid and works well.\n\n* Asynchronous multiplayer support is a great feature and lets casual players like myself start a few games, play a move against different players and then forget about it for a day or two and only come back to those games when I need to. It also helps to reduce the problems associated with lower numbers of players in multiplayer.\n* The choice of cross platform and non-DRM-restricted servers deserve special mention. They mean multiplayer is universal and should the game ever be made on other platforms, everyone would be able to integrate.\n* Local multiplayer is also included and a pass-and-play mode for two people playing on the same computer (i.e. controllers or two keyboards, etc).\n\nMistakes and Annoyances\nKhet 2.0 is a fairly simple concept, design and overall game which makes it ripe for improvement and addition over time. Unfortunately it's still slightly rough around the edges and has some minor issues that could affect your choice of a purchase.\n\nThe multiplayer functionality works, but it's somewhat lacking in depth, and the number of players online is a concern for a game like this. Matches are listed by tags showing the settings of the game, but there are no filter options whatsoever. I spent some time in the lobby and was only ever able to see the same 20 or so games already in progress, and with no spectator option, this was essentially pointless data to show. Similarly, chatting in game is impossible, and communicating via Steam is the only current option, which pauses gameplay and causes frustration.\n\nAn Eye of Horus Beam Splitter game piece was originally launched as an expansion piece for the board game and has been added as a DLC. While it does significantly affect gameplay, and is priced fairly, it's still hard to view this as anything other than a cash grab. Considering the price  of the original title and the presumably small amount of development time this took to add, it should be included in the original title instead of offered as DLC. The big block of DLC promotion on the title screen is also rather jarring.\n\n* The graphics are fairly boring, bland and poor. While it doesn't affect gameplay and isn't a reason not to buy, it would've been nice to had some colour customization, themes, designs, backgrounds or anything to add to the very bland art design.\n* The A.I. is somewhat unpredictable, which adds an element of chance, but also makes beating the A.I. very easy in many situations, even on extreme difficulties.\n\nRecommendations\nAt the time of review, Khet 2.0 is available on Steam for £6.99/9.99€/$9.99 which, if you enjoy chess and are likely to put more than 10-15 hours into this title, is well worth the price. When weighed against competition however, it may feel a little overpriced. Hero Academy, for comparison, is a similarly simple asynchronous strategic board game and comes in at half the price, and Tabletop Simulator, a game with multiple gameplay elements, including Chess, Go, and tons more, is only around twice the price.\n\nWhen on sale however, Khet 2.0 is a good deal for the strategic thinking lover. There's also a 2-Pack option which saves you a few extra bucks if you have a friend.\n\nThe Eye of Horus DLC includes the Beam Splitter piece originally offered as an expansion piece to Khet 1.0. It significantly affects gameplay and you can try it out in multiplayer games by finding someone hosting a game with it included (only the host needs have the DLC to use it). That said, it's, at least in my opinion, a bad move not to include this in the base game, so each to their own.\n\n* Hive is an equally unique and interesting take on a strategic board game which comes from the same team under the same academic roots and is worth a look for anyone who liked Khet 2.0\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/312720","July 27, 2015","true","8.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A 2 player game, in the vein of classic boardgames like chess or Stratego, with the novelty of bouncing lasers off mirrors on the playing pieces.\n\nAs a singleplayer game, Khet 2.0 is very functional. The AI has several difficulty levels, and will scale from the novice to the experienced player nicely. Games are quick, playing out in 5 or 10 minutes.\n\nAs a multiplayer game, the problem is that there's almost no-one else playing at any given time. As I write this review, Steamcharts.com tells me that the peak number of users in the last day for this game stands at FOUR players. If you have friends who'll play this with you, you'll be fine.

The original is below.\n\nThe devs certainly do their best for us. Every bug or question has been answered and followed up and as far as I know, has been solved. The bugs that I have encountered seem to be fixed now.\nSo thumbs up for the developer!\n\nRead my original message for the rest of the game:\n\nThis game certainly has its flaws, but it is a very nice game and its core usually works.\n\nAt this time of writing, I experience crashes every time I try to do a rematch. No problem, I go back to the main menu and start a new game. One time, I had a crash mid-game (and I think I was winning). Too bad.\nBut the devs seem to listen to these complaints and I am hopefully waiting for the next update.\n\nTo talk about the game itself:\n- I didn't know the board game before this game came to Steam, so I can't tell wether it is a good replacement for the board game, but I actually believe that it must be because I can't think of anything the board game could have more.\n- The graphics aren't great, I don't mind and neither should you because you don't play this kind of game for AAA graphics but for the experience. Still, it would, in my opinion, be an improvement if the graphics were better because it pleases the eye.\n- The AI on EASY mode is way too easy, play it only to get started. But also on MEDIUM, the AI seems to be an idiot. Yesterday, I won on HARD and had the feeling that the AI should have seen it coming. Maybe EXPERT or IMPOSSIBLE will give me the difficulty I need, but I can't tell yet. Anyway, there is a multiplayer option if you want the real stuff.\n\nShort: this game is ok, but it needs bugfixes.
