"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/recommended/105450/","PrivateGodfrey","Captain MooMoos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PrivateGodfrey/","490 products in account","This review is a little lengthy, so if you just want to know why I recommend this game skip the Results and read from there.\n\nAge of Empires III not only lives up, but pushes forward the great series that is Age of Empires. Most people compare it as being weaker than its predecessor Age of Empires II, but I find that these people tend to not see the greatness in this game. It seems in this Age of Empires the game became more realistic, in that the Colonial Era was a point in time when no longer were kingdoms limited in wealth by the amount of gold they could mine. Instead it brings in new Cash Crops, which allow each nation to produce Gold outside of traditional methods.\n\nCampaign:\nThis is a great game with an in-depth campaign that goes through the stories of a Scottish Explorer and his sons/daughters. The campaign is interesting and introduces different styles of gameplay from macro-managing to micro-managing with scavenging and hording. Definitely worth the play through, for Age of Empires III and Age of Empires III: War Chiefs. Age of Empires III: The Asian Dynasties is fun, but the campaign has nothing to do with either of the other two expansions.\n\nGameplay:\nAge of Empires III offers a brilliant combat system that no longer requires precise delegation of finite resources, but allows for macro-scale battle. Allowing some players to turtle and others to expand, depending on your gameplay you can grow or stay at home. Mining gold and gathering food will always garnish better results than farming gold and food. Not only can you focus different resource harvesting strategies, but you can also use different strategies in your combat choices. You can buy mercenaries which cost only gold, or even capture native towns and create tribal units. This can allow you to vary your tactics based on your environment as well as your team.\n\nTeams:\nThis game introduces new challenges with Teams that are complex and highly differentiated, unlike in the predecessors where each team essentially was the same as the last minus a few shifts in upgrade options and one special unit (plus two special upgrades). Age of Empires III and its two expansions offer a variety of teams which include peoples of Europe, Americas, and Asia. Age of Empires III includes the Spanish, British, French, Portuguese, Dutch, Germans, Russians, and Ottomans. Age of Empires III: War Chiefs then offer three more teams including The Aztecs, Sioux, and Iroquois. Finally Age of Empires III: Asian Dynasties adds an additional three teams the Indians, Chinese, and Japanese.\n\nHints:\nIf you actually want to enjoy this game make sure you edit your cities in order to get all the cards, as earning all the cards takes more than one lifetime. I have owned all three of these games before they were on steam and I put over +300 hours into it still to not have one civilization at maximum level.\n\nResults:\nIf you enjoy real time strategy games, enjoy managing an economy, epic large battles, and don't like excessive micromanaging then this is the game for you. It offers brilliant combat with amazing scenery. The unit mapping is rather brilliant and the variety of maps keeps you constantly wanting to play more.\n\nPros:\n+Fun campaign with a rather interesting story (for a strategy game).\n+High level of variability in teams\n+Allowing for turtle or rushing player types\n+Good difficulty curve in AI (allowing boosting resource harvest rates to find the best balance of difficulty)\n+Each civilization is like a whole new game\n+On map bonuses to give reasons for exploring and moving quick across the map.\n+Brilliant strategy diversification with special tribal towns on each map type, and special mercenary units for each map.\n+Many different types of gameplay which keep the skirmishes from seeming repetitive.\n+Loads of cards to choose from allowing you to choose if you want to Turtle, Rush, or Support.\n\nCons:\n-Leveling civilizations is rather dull (just edit the text file)\n-You cannot select your AI team members’ cards, which means they will just use resource cards, villagers, and soldiers (not team cards).\n-Some civilizations seem unbalanced. (figure it out for yourself as we all have our views on this).\n-Rather than producing names for the map choices they are named after states (which can be really hard to guess what type of map you will get if you're not familiar with US Geography).\n-You can only have two teams in skirmish mode, which is really annoying if you used to like playing 2v2v2v2.\n-You cannot have repeat civilizations; this means there is only one England per map.","February 26, 2014","true","94.5"," 467 of 488 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","467","488","0","17"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shafatR/recommended/105450/","shafatR","Raysh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shafatR/","655 products in account","If you haven't heard of Age of Empires, then say hello to one of the most iconic RTS franchises. With the release of Age of Empires 2 HD Edition, there's quite a bit to go around for fans of the franchise. But enough about that, how is Age of Empire 3?\n\nWell it really depends on what you're after. Visually, it's still pretty freaking gorgeous, and it holds up quite well, though it does show its age a bit (what do you expect for an 9 year old game). the lighting effects are great, and the smoke and particle effects, especially the destructible debris that falls of buildings is a nice visual treat, and I remember how amazing it looked back in 2005, and to me it still looks great.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it feels more in line with Age of Mythology, Ensemble's previous entry, rather than Age of Empires. From the way you choose a leader each age (mirrors choosing minor deities in Age of Mythology) to general UI layout and control schemes, AoE3 feels much like a spiritual successor to Age of Mythology, with a focus on historics rather than mythos.\n\nThough with this iteration of the series,  there are new, much needed improvements. Gone is the need for a drop off point for your workers; like the Atlantean race in AoM:TT (Age of Mythology: The Titans), your workers only need to mine from the resource to generate that resource. This makes macromangement considerably less fiddly.\n\nAnother change is how Caravans work in AoE3; instead of building a market, creating some caravans, and sending them to a Town Centre, there are now neutral Trading Posts that need to capture, which provide a steady steam of either Wood, Gold, Food or Experience. There are other neutral buildings the map, such as native settlements, or saloons which give you access to new units.\n\nBut by far the biggest addition to the series is the Home City. The Home City has a deck of shipment cards which can be sent to you during the game, depending on how many levels you gain through experience (gained by fighting, find treasure, building or from aforementioned trade caravans). The shipments can range from dozens of cavalry soldiers, supplies of wood/gold/food,  to permanent improvements to military, defense, economy and so on. It can change how you play, and it's an interesting additon to the game.\n\nThe singleplayer in the Complete Collection offers up plenty of content, with about 8 campaigns, ranging from 15th/16th Century colonials to Battle at Little Bighorn, to the Indian Revolution, and even a little bit in Japan during the Sengoku period. It has plenty of nicely realised characters, interesting stories for each campaign, and enough content for each campaign so they don't feel short. This along with the 14 civilizations you can play in singleplayer (and multiplayer, though there isnt much of a population) skirmishes means plenty of content for your money's worth.\n\nIf you're new to the Age of Empires franchise or if you enjoyed Age of Mythology, then Age of Empires 3 will be a fun ride through some events through history. If you preferred Age of Empires 2, then you might not like Age of Empires 3 quite as much. For me though, its a hearty recommendation.","November 11, 2014","true","46.3"," 289 of 299 people (97%) found this review helpful 17 people found this review funny","97","289","299","17","1"

Instead, you will gain a deep knowledge of zoology and learn how to beat up people and steal their stuff.\n\nGeneral:\n>Zoology Lessons – Some things you will learn: Capybaras and tapirs live in Central and South America, Ibex, Saigas, and Marco Polo sheeps live in central Asia, Serows live in Japan and the rest of Asia.\n>Japanese Daimyos can materialize samurai out of thin air.\n>Shogun Tokugawa is a wizard that can open portals to other worlds and summon the likes of monks with clubs, shinobi that shoot grenades using their bows, and entire artillery companies.\n>The original American Continental Marines were an army of Japanese Ronin Samurai mercenaries.\n>If you throw a lot of torches into a building, it will not burn. However, it will break apart and then finally explode.\n>Native American fire pit dances generate magic that they put to use in battle, putting Warcraft spellcasters to shame.\n>Medicine men, surgeons, and priests all perform the same healing magic.\n>Even standing near an idle monster truck could be lethal.\n>Even before the creation of the United States, George Washington always knew he’d end up on both the quarter and the dollar bill.\n>As an Asian power, you can ally with your enemy through the consulate… and still wage war with their forces with soldiers from their own home country.\n>Chinese flamethrowers never burn anything, they just kill it and blow it up.\n>The British employed the use of longbowmen well into the 1800s.\n>Cuauhtemoc of the Aztecs is a cool guy; he has a blood fetish and refers to himself in third person.\n>Queen Isabella so desperate, she’ll sleep with Cuauhtemoc\n>Akbar of the Indians is worse than a fervent Jehovah’s Mormon as he constantly attempts to convert you to his religion (Hinduism) while beating him up.

They turned out to be their morons in aluminum foil.\n>The story of the original Thanksgiving is full of lies, propagated by the capitalist pigs in Washington. The true story goes as follows. In 1603, Shogun Tokugawa wanted to construct a new shogunate palace. He sent a group of Japanese pilgrims across the ocean. A few years later, they landed on Plymouth in New England, an excellent place for a new shogunate palace. There, they befriended a native scout and his pet intrepid scout turkey. Shortly thereafter, a group of allied Chinese pilgrims came ashore and set up shop alongside them. The Japanese and Chinese came together for a great turkey dinner. HOWEVER… The French and the Ottomans landed around the same time and did not take kindly to what they saw as encroachment upon their lands. A great war ensued in which the Chinese and Japanese ultimately prevailed. In the end, a great Thanksgiving feast was held in the new shogunate palace with Tokugawa as the host.\n\n>SPECIAL EDIT: Indestructable outposts\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZbC69DS_D0\n\nCivilizations:\n>You can beat up the British and steal their tea.\n>You can beat up the French and steal their military victories.\n>You can beat up the Dutch and steal their tulips.\n>You can beat up the Portuguese and steal their secret liquor.\n>You can beat up the Spanish and steal their dogs.\n>You can beat up the Germans and steal their beer.\n>You can beat up the Ottoman Turks and steal their turkey.\n>You can beat up the Russians and steal their vodka.\n>You can beat up the Iroquois and steal Hiawatha’s poetry.\n>You can beat up the Sioux and steal Gall’s gallbladder.\n>You can beat up the Aztecs and steal their bottled blood.\n>You can play as the Japanese and steal your allies’ food.\n>You can beat up the Chinese and steal their many inventions and claim them as your own.\n>You can beat up the Indians and steal their elephants and then beat up their sacred cows.\n\nCampaigns:\nThe campaigns of the base game and The Warchiefs expansion provide an interesting story that follows the Blacks, a family of mostly brutal dark magic thieves. They can create entire armies and civilizations that a can appear and disappear within an hour. However, they end up being known and portrayed as heroes as they more often than not beat up bad guys and steal their stuff.

How can one possibly begin to review a game of such magnitude and prevalence that this game holds on the gaming world? A game that, even though it has been out for over 10 years, has a large active online community? It isn’t possible, but I shall nevertheless try.\n\nThis game has a rich story, which is full of interesting historical points. Even though it is fictional, it pleasantly covers the conquests of the new world. In the vanilla version and “The War Chiefs” expansion, the player can endeavour to fight against various European civilisations in order to achieve glory and fame throughout the Americas. In “The Asian Dynasties” expansion, it spans centuries of Asian colonialization by the British as well as the Japanese and the Chinese Dynasties.\n\nThe gameplay is a perfect reflection of the RTS genre. You slowly build your settlement to include markets, barracks and a host of other buildings, increasing your population and army before getting ready to attack your enemy or defend your settlement. Getting the fine balance between your food, wood and coin collection can be challenging but rewarding when you get it right. Will you build a good army to begin with, or a good economy, praying that your enemy won’t attack before you’ve had chance to convert your good economy into a powerful army? Each of the units has a strength and a weakness. For example, skirmishers counter musketeers, cavalry counters skirmishers, and musketeers counter cavalry. So it’s important to get the balance right when creating your army. The new eso-community patch has nicely levelled out the civilisations, making the OP civilisations slightly less powerful and the UP civilisations slightly more powerful.\n\nGraphically, the game is simply gorgeous. Even though it’s definitely not a new game, it doesn’t feel outdated in this respect and looks magnificent from a distance (you’ll want to play fully zoomed out to maximise what you can see on the screen at all times). From buildings setting on fire and slowly crumbling as they take damage, to the glorious water reflections, to the breathtaking bloom effects, you’ll be wondering whether it was actually made in 2005, or 2015.\n\nThe music is purely divine. I’m listening to it as I type this as it’s one of my favourite game original soundtracks of all time. As your colony grows into a mighty empire the soundtrack seamlessly transitions from slow, peaceful renaissance/discovery era, to the powerful and more rhythmic late game, mimicking the chugging of steam engines and factories as you journey into the industrial age.\n\nOverall, a stunning game. If you haven’t ever played it, buy it and experience it for yourself. You will not be disappointed.","November 18, 2015","true","497.1"," 237 of 253 people (94%) found this review helpful 14 people found this review funny","94","237","253","14","7"

This game is brilliant, although the AI may be silly at times *cough, Napolean* it still has unique gameplay and good graphics, as well a Pretty decent uprgade system. I loved the fact that different units would take up a certain amount of population, e.g. A dragoon would take up 2 population where as the a musketeer would take up 1. There is a huge variety of map choices and with the Asian dynasties pack and The war cheifs DLC, the selection choices are endless, they vary from the Amazon River, The Andes, Anywhere in the US and even the Great silk road in Asia.\n\nBest feature for me? The Expansion Packs were actually expansions that changed the game in multiple ways and added on to the complete/full base form of the game. normally DLC nowadays is required to get the full package of what the final product should've been. AoE3's Expansion Packs ARE NOT DLC. The Expansion Packs in AoE3 add on to the game content enough to make it feel like a different game within a game. The Expansion Packs aren't neccessary to fully enjoy Age of Empires III; however, having them improves upon the player experience greater.\n\nIf you enjoy real time strategy games, enjoy managing an economy, epic large battles, and don't like excessive micromanaging then this is the game for you.

That's mainly due to the excellent using of lighting effects (shades and HDR), the textures and animation on a closer look however, are on the same level as Age of Mythology (kinda obvious they used the same engine), which is a little bit dated. But it doesn't hurt at all, for some of the best RTS games like SupCom and COH aren't beautiful up close either.\n\nSound: Soundtracks are awesome, definitely the best in the franchise and probably one of the best in the whole genre. I especially love the track of revolution event, it pumps me up so much that I want to punch a freaking baby in the face. Sound effects are even more impressive, more so the sound of canons. God how I love the sound of canon fire in this game, every shot is like the mixture of bass solo and Morgan Freeman monologue coming out of a subwoofer. Pure heaven.\n\nGameplay: Quite different from the previous games. The tempo has been speeded up a bit. Range attack becomes the mainstream and melee the sidekick. Resources are down to 3, which I think is acceptable. Civs feel very distinct from each other especially those from different continents. Balance is marginally okay, with 3 pretty OP civs and same amount of trench tier ones. Many new features like homecity and card deck building are actually great fun and add a lot to the strategic depth. Online games are quite stable and smooth, and usually end in stomping.\n\nMods: I love the mod Napoleonic Era to death. This along with another mod called The War of the Triple Alliance make me rate this game among top 3 RTS on my list. Holy crap the additional civs and features are mindblowing. I really wish for 2 things, that we will one day get Steam Workshop for AOE3 and one day the devs of these two mods be contracted by Microsoft to combine the mods into an official expansion, just like The Forgotten to AOE2.\n\nCommunity: Friendly, steady, small in size but alive. That's all I can say.\n\nConclusion: Don't let nostalgia get the best of you. AOE3 is different from AOE2, but in a good way.","June 13, 2015","true","43.2"," 105 of 125 people (84%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","84","105","125","19","5"

Even at full price. This is a necessity for any strategy players collection.\nGirl vs Game: Unless it's some super model I'd definately rather play the Game.\n\nPersonal Comment:\nThis is an amazing game with endless amounts of game time. The hours on here isnt a fraction of my actual game time online and offline. Been playing this game since the day it was released and still play it and love it today. I even missed a couple of meals as well as toilet breaks playing this believe it or not. I have bladder and bowel control of a ninja thanks to AOE.\n\nOnline gaming:\nThe online gaming community is still very active and people of all skill levels are on it. You will find anywhere between 500 to 2000 people online at any given time. Beware though that even though AOE is helpful and awesome the online community are sometimes a bunch of cocktonsil nimrod supremists who think they're amazing whilst never having seen or felt a girl up close unless in a magazine. But if your skin is thick and you dont give a flying **** about other people you'll be fine.\n\nShort Summary:\nThis is a real time strategy game that plays off in the medieval times. There are 8 standard civilizations, 3 native indian civilizations and 3 Asian civilizations. Each civ provides a different set of advantages and it takes time to learn how to utilise the various civs to their full capability. Learning each civilisation takes time and it is great fun doing that. There are countless amounts of maps that allow for the use of different strategies. The game also has a story rich single player campaign. I have not played the campaign yet but never felt the need to as the standard game modes offer more than enough fun and game time.\nThe game also has progressive improvement meaning the more you play the more items get unlocked and the stronger your civilisation becomes. This ensures that you want to play more and more in order to improve the strength of your favourite civilisation.\n\nLearning Curve and Gameplay:\nEasy to start but tough to master. The learning curve to start playing and learning the basics is very easy. Learning the various civilisations and their strengths is more challenging and may take a lot of practice and time. The gameplay is very simplistic in it being a basic RTS with click and place. Gathering of basic resources and using those resources are easy and self explanotary. A tutorial can be played to understand the basics but this game is very playable and a new player will get it after playing only for a few hours.","November 26, 2015","true","63.9"," 101 of 120 people (84%) found this review helpful 45 people found this review funny","84","101","120","45","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Weed_Wizard/recommended/105450/","Weed_Wizard","Grand Master Diabetes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Weed_Wizard/","110 products in account","Do you like video games? Do you like RTSs? Do you like not having to have 300 apm to keep a constant stream of resources coming in? Then you will like AoE 3. If you don't go hardcore or of Asian descent and play strategy games like a casual (like me) then you will also like this game. What I mean is that the macro from Age of Empires II was VERY watered down in AoE 3. Sure you still need some form of it like all RTSs, but the amount has dropped very much so. And I LOVE gunpowder units. Nothing is more satisfying then seeing 100+ musketiers poppin caps in each other like this is Chicago.\n\nThe addition of Home City shipments is another feature that I like. Basically you choose around 20 shipments (they are cards that you put into a deck and you pick new cards everytime you level your home city) gain experience from various actions and once you accumulate enough you gain the ability to call in a shipment to your town center. Cards are also Age related and most can only be used once. The cards can range from calling in military units, villagers, economic shipments and buildings, and upgrades for many different things. And some cards affect all your allies. There is a lot of different strats you can go with a deck.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier you have Home Cities for each civ. Basically when you first start the game you choose which Civilization you want to be, then you choose your home city name and your explorer name ( you can put any name you want for both, great feature ) then you go into a game. You gain exp as you finish games, gaining levels for your city. Then you can unlock new cards. Some cards are locked until later levels ( it goes something like 10>25>40 I think) but from what I have since they aren't that much better, still useful though. If you want to play a different civ you have to make another home city for them and can also name that anything you want, along with the explorer, starting back at level one ( Unless you play the DLC, for some odd reason you start at level 10 with 10 unlocks. So just play the Asian DLC since it has everything for the other one and the base game.) Each Civ has different cards available at the start and to unlock although about half are universal.\n\nOnto the gameplay it is mostly the same as AoE 2. With the addition of Trade Routes and Native camps (which supply extra resources and unlocks special respectively) it adds some degree of map control. There probably was already map control on AoE 2 but I know little of how the meta is for it. If there was I'm sure trade routes and native camps add even more since the extra resources are a huge bonus ( They start off giving only Exp and can be upgrade 3 times with the last being a train, another feature I like. And the free exp is HUGE to getting early home shipment points) and natives can harass early on. Natives also don't add to pop limit but you can only train a certain amount. Having more than half of all the trade posts and native camps gives you the option to start a Trade monopoly victory, which gives you victory in 5 minutes if they don't destroy any trade posts/native camps, helps if the enemy is turtling hard. You also can only build one castle and thats from a shipment you get (Russians can build more I believe). And if the wagon it starts off as gets destory you don't get another. Stone was also removed as a resource. Also, cannons and muskets. Pretty much the two man things you will build, or at least for me. Still plenty of archers, cavalry, swordmen, pikemen, etc. A lot of civs have more than one special unit, and they aren't built from the castle only. The population cap is set at 200 and that has mixed feelings but I'm fine with it. The graphics are great even though I run it on low. Haven't played the campaign nor the multiplayer, just skirmishs.\n\nOverall, a great game and a must buy for any RTS fan. Even if it is slightly watered down from AoE 2 the new additions to it and time setting are amazing, great gameplay, and good graphics.\n\n40 dollars though? Damn, definitely worth at at any sales price, but who even buys triple A games over 30? Still worth it at 40.","January 4, 2014","true","38.6"," 57 of 62 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","57","62","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/105450/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","The original Age of Empires packed a stunning visual punch and backed it up with solid gameplay. Back at a time where most strategy games were chunky and 2D, the first Age game pulled aside the curtain to reveal a world that was sunny, animated, colorful and lifelike. Strategy games were never the same. Age of Empires III presents a similar leap forward for real-time strategy fans. As Half-Life 2 did for first-person shooters, AoE III shows just how inspiring these games can be when lovingly crafted with outstanding artistry and solid gameplay fundamentals.\n\nAge of Empires III doesn't redefine real-time strategy gameplay. You're still scurrying to collect more resources than your opponents and rushing to field a giant army, and the game still rewards frantic clicking and unit management. But the presentation is unmatched, and even though the game is rooted in RTS conventions, there are enough new elements and strategic variations here to addict even grizzled veterans. If you're a fan of the genre, you owe it to yourself to check this game out. And if you've never played a real-time game before, this is the place to start.\n\nGraphically, the engine that powers Age of Empires III has a laundry list of the latest graphics technology: real-time shadows, high dynamic range lighting, you name it. There's even bump-mapping on the barrels of the cannons. But the real impressive thing about the technology isn't that it's there, it's that you don't notice it. From the moment your Home City first appears on the menu screen, or a new map loads up to reveal pale grey waters lapping quietly against rocky New England shores, you become lost in the game world. The latest in technology is coupled with truly beautiful art.\n\nAge III pulls out all the stops to depict the sweeping majesty of the old west or the unspoiled beauty of the colonial-era Americas. One of the single-player campaign cutscenes, done in the game engine, pans across rolling hills of golden grass while huge herds of buffalo amble along like waves of water. Another level depicts a small Caribbean port picking up the pieces after a devastating hurricane, with citizens milling about amidst wrecked ships and broken docks. Yet another level has you picking your way through a dense swamp looking for the ruins of Spanish treasure ships half-buried in the mud and dripping with gold doubloons. You're never lacking for eye candy.\n\nThe music is equally impressive. Done in full orchestra, it moves effortlessly from majestic scores highlighting the beauty of the landscape to pounding battle drums accenting the fury of battle.\n\nOf course, the combat is equally spectacular. The goal of the game is to devastate your opponents, and said devastation is accompanied by deeply satisfying images of destruction. A large part of this has to do with the real physics incorporated onto the game engine. You can feel the impact when a cannonball shatters into a wooden frontier building, breaking it into pieces that fly off in macabre arcs. Smoke billows from muskets, cannons leap back as they expel their fury, building spires burst into flame and collapse into themselves, and the masts of ships crash to the deck as the vessel shudders with the impact of enemy fire. Every game of Age of Empires III drips with spectacle.\n\nAge III simulates colonization, meaning that the town you build in the game can request "shipments" from your Home City. You gain new shipments by earning experience, and you have a set list of things that you can send over. This has a profound impact on your strategy. Do you send over economic resources early, to give your town a leg up on the competition? Or do you send over tons of military units, so that you can field an advanced army while your neighbors are still building up? Shipments add a lot to the game by giving you more strategic possibilities, and by giving you incentive to rapidly earn experience. They really reward players for going out and making things happen around the map.\n\nEvery map is also dotted with Native American villages or trade routes that can be built up by your colony. Controlling a trading post gives you free experience or resources whenever a trade cart comes by, whereas Native American villages can provide you with inexpensive military units or technology upgrades. Controlling these points on the map gives you a major edge over the long term. As a result, it's a rush to be the first to locate these points, and they are always hotly contested. Battles usually play out as a series of skirmishes across the map before big conflicts rage at the town centers.\n\nFinally, Age of Empires III adds the "Home City" concept. Outside of the real-time portion of the game, you can create a Home City representing the world power that's supplying your colonies. Your Home City has a level - like an RPG character - representing how experienced it is. As you earn experience playing the game your city will "Level up" and you can choose new abilities for it, in effect deciding what kinds of shipments you'd like to send to your colonies. The decision about what kinds of upgrades to make to your city is agonizing and has a tangible impact on the main game. It's also fun just to level up, develop, and customize your own personal city. One nice side effect here is that, even if you get totally ♥♥♥-whupped in a multiplayer game, you probably still earned a lot of experience to use to develop your city. This concept works great all around and really contributes to the game.\n\nThe single-player campaign is divided into three acts representing three generations of the same family. Picking up where Age of Kings left off, the lead character in the first campaign is a Knight adventuring in the New World in search of a lost treasure. Said treasure impacts his whole family line, as depicted in Act II, a rip-roaring Davy-Crockett style adventure starring his Grandson. Act III picks up two generations later, featuring a wild west romp involving railroads, the Mexican war, and a quest into the Amazon jungles before the family finally finds closure. As with the other production values of the game, the writing is solid and the voice acting is great.\n\nThere's a good variety of missions in the single-player campaign, from protecting a stronghold until help arrives to building a railroad line to battling pirates along a series of islands. None of the individual scenarios have you doing things that hadn't been done in other RTS games, but the real magic is in the gameplay, which allows you to develop a different Home City for each act and tackle each scenario differently.\n\nTruly hardcore strategy gamers might find lots of nitpicks in Age of Empires III. It's difficult to unload transport ships, healers have to be micro-managed or they'll charge into combat, and there aren't a lot of options for customizing your hotkeys. Artillery units on occasion can't decide to fire or pack up to move. But the important thing is that none of these little problems really impacts the core game.\n\nAge of Empires III is an absolutely fantastic title with superb graphics and tight gameplay. Single-player or multiplayer, no matter what your skill, you'll get hours of joy out of this sucker online or off. Age of Empires III may not redefine real-time strategy gaming, but it sets the bar so high that we'll be comparing games to this for years. Shoulder your musket and pony up: this one's a real trip.","February 11","true","159.1"," 49 of 51 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","49","51","4","0"

What to expect of it?\n\nIf you have never played the first two parts of AoE, here you'll get a little summary: Age of Empires I and II were defining new standards for the RTS-genre when they came out. Not as fast-paced as Starcraft or WarCraft, but with more strategical Depth and more focus on the organization of your camp and with a build-in history-part wich made the game even a little educational without decreasing the fun of the gameplay. You always could choose from many different cultures which had some units and technology in common, but some unique units and cultural advantages and disadvantages.\n\nNow, what is different in AoE III?\nFirst of all, after AoE I playing in antique times and AoE II playing in Medieval times up to the discovery of the new world, AoE III consequently plays in times of the colonization of America and the civil war. Like AoE I & II, AoE III contains many true historical events, locations and persons, but unlike both prequels, the main storyline of the campaigns is highly fictional so that it might be difficult to tell which events in the game truely happend and which are made up. The main storyline of the campaign is about a sect which tries to find and conquer the fountain of youth in the new world and a family which is bound by fate to stop them. On their journeys they encounter many historical persons like Georg Washington or Bolivar, but most of the game is about hunting down the sect. So the game is far less educational then the previous ones.\n\nThe second big difference is that the cultures do not longer have most techs and units in common but every nation has their own tech tree. Some things of course still are open to every culture but the differences between the cultures are far bigger then before. This isn't much of a problem because you can still tell the strengths and weaknesses of an unfimilar unit very fast, but it is more difficult then before to play a new nation.\n\nAnd the there are the RPG-elements. Not only do you have imortal hero-units (like in Age of Mythology) which can only be knocked unconscious and stand up again if no more enemy units are around, you will also play random maps with a "hometown" which can level up between games and send you support if you collect enough experience by surviving a certain time, killing enemy units or building your camp. Although this may increase the motivation to play more random maps they removed the option to play a random culture, which I really loved in AoE I & II.\n\nThe AIs are weaker then in AoE II which is good for beginners but a little disappointing for more expert players. The balancing is also worse. There are some strategies to break the game. A pack of at least 20 osman heavy bombards, for example, is almost invincible. No AI-player ever was able to beat me if I got that far.\n\nWith the complete Collection, you will also get the two Add-Ons: The War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties.\n\nThe War Chiefs adds playable Native American Tribes (Without this Add-On they are only available as some sort of mercenaries if you build trading posts near their villages witch appear randomly on random maps). Although playing a native american culture is a very wellcome change and a challenge, it is clearly unbalanced. Those cultures are given many new and unique techniques like sending settlers to a totem and dance to do rites which give you advantages like faster ressources or stronger soldiers, they still desperatly lack heavy siege weaponary. Native american soldiers are only strong in large nummers and will have to attack early to not get overwhelmed by superior firepower of other nations.\nThe Add-On also adds two campaigns which complete the storyline of the original game campaign by filling gaps and finishing the somehow open story. The focus, of course, is more on the war of the native americans against the europeans and so it is no true surprise that you will have to face general Custer at wounded Knee. Still the two new campaigns are much more shallow...\n\nThe Asian Dynasties finally adds some civilizations from Asia like the Indians and the Chinese. The storyline of the new campaigns has nothing to do with the story of the original campaign. The Indian campaign for example takes place around the fight for independence in India and the chinese campaign describes the discovery of the american continent by a chinese admiral which might have taken place (or maybe not) long before Columbus was born.\n\nOverall AoE III: Complete Collection is a decent RTS game with some unique features, but if you were a big fan of AoE I & II you might be disappointed because it is a really different game then what you are used to. Still it is worth a try.\nIf you have never played AoE I or II, but you like RTS games, you should definitly try this one.","November 16, 2014","true","44.1"," 38 of 42 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","38","42","2","0"

This, with the gameplay, cooperates and makes it a very fun experience for strategy gamers because the gameplay, is as normal with Age of Empire series, is great.\n\nThe graphics are dated, however they are not all that bad.\n\nPeople still play multiplayer, and MP is very fun, as it has modded modes, to just normal gameplay, so the community is not dead.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to any strategy fan. The overall experience is worth the price tag.\n\n8/10.\n\n----\n\nThanks for reading my review!

For instance, to change the hotkeys you need to manually go through each tab. There is also no Steam Cloud, but they did add Trading Cards so that's one interesting thing to look forward to.\n\nThis game is soon to have 10 years after it's release. But this edition is by far the best one yet. You get all the expansions. Working multiplayer with a community that still lives. And of course that same old strategy many remember and honor as "one of the best".\n\nThe modest presentation of it's ancestors passed away. I'd say that the magnificence of the soundtrack itself says a lot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7EWfMfHlFck&list=PL37F10A7ECDC81CA0&index=9\n\nA Musical score composed by Ensemble Studios musicians Stephen Rippy and Kevin McMullan.\n\nIf History is of any interest to you, if the New World conquests were something you're keen on.

For the "European Civs" (I put that in quotes because while the Ottoman Turks are not from Europe at all, they play like one of the other European civs), that diversity is actually rather subtle, with each civ having one or two units totally unique to them, as well as a couple semi-universal units that are their "Best Units", which get special high-tier upgrades. For example, while the Spanish get Hussars, like the British, the British can upgrade them to "Kingsguard" Hussars, while the Spanish just get regular "Guard" Hussars. The distinction is rather intuitive; basically, if a unit gets a special name once it hits its second upgrade, it'll be better in some way than a unit that doesn't. In this way, the European civs harken back, somewhat, to Age of Empires II, which had each civ only have one or two unique units. On the other hand, each of the Native American and Asian civs are completely different, with entirely different units and even different mechanics, and which units each civ is best with is fairly obvious a few minutes into playing them. The diversity is further enhanced with mercenary units available from the home city and native american units from trading posts.\n\nGood story campaigns: I can't quite make this point without clarification. The first three campaigns were not that great. Those were the pre-expansion ones, and frankly, the series had really stopped working out those storytelling muscles it had in Age of Empires II. The action often felt disjointed and rushed, with the endings of each of the three campaigns being the only bits that seemed to matter or have any impact. However, all of that said, the latter five campaigns were actually quite good, especially if you could disengage them from the taint of their predecessors in terms of tropes and pacing. In addition, the characters personal struggles in the latter five campaigns were more apparent, their inner struggles seemed to mean so much more. Really, if you want a great story, the latter five campaigns are pretty damn good.\n\nGood* Mechanics: This game has some rather... mixed mechanics. I'll get to the bad later, but for now, the good news! The home city is the big thing that was touted on release, and frankly, I like the concept a lot. It allows a player to gain advantages specific to their strategy, whether it be resource gathering, naval dominance, or raw military power. Essentially, the way the Home City works is that the player assigns cards to a deck, each card representing a batch of units or an upgrade or some resources. When a home city shipment is available in game, the player selects one of the cards they've assigned, and after a brief waiting period (Hey, it takes time to get a Declaration to Claim the New World overseas. Cut them some slack.), the units, tech, etc. arrives. In addition to this as one of the primary mechanics, you've got your normal suite of resource gathering (done with villager-type units) and military unit production. An interesting nuance of the unit production here is that when you've got a military building selected, let's say, the Barracks, and let's say you want to train a sqaud of Musketeers. You can shift-click the unit portrait to train five at once. While this may not seem novel by itself; a few games already allow this sort of thing, the novel thing is that doing it this way makes the waiting period for your units slightly longer, but you get all five units at once. The Russians and Chinese have this as their primary mechanic, with the Russians training "blocks" of infantry, and the Chinese creating "Banner Armies" which are groups of various unit combinations. Overall, the mechanics are decent in most respects. In addition, the game very cleverly and subtley hampers rushing, which was a brutal, and often severely effective tactic in Age of Empires II, by making it so that the player cannot send units from the home city, or even train them, until the second technological era. I hardly ever notice that my efforts at building an army are being hampered by this restriction, but when I do notice it, I am appreciative of the clever design choice.\n\nBad points of Age of Empires III:\n\nBad* Mechanics: As I said, this game has some mixed mechanics. Now we come to the bad. The primary problem we have here is that while the home city, is in concept, a nice idea with some potential for strategic use, it seems best used as a rush enabler. Earlier, I mentioned that the game restricts rushing by limiting military units to the second age and following. But the home city can easily be stocked with military unit shipments so that come second era, you can get an entire army, virtually free of charge. Here's a hot tip for those cheese players out there: Get the best second-era military unit shipments you can. Then, in game, save up your shipments. Once you get to age II, build a Church. Then research Mercantilism, which gets you around 3 shipments for 1,000 Coin. Then, in essence, spawn a horde of troops. Admittedly, this really only works for the European civs, but the overwhelming potential for early-midgame rush is still somewhat staggering, and it means that some of the more interesting home city shipments may not ever see play. In addition, many games, it seems, are decided well before the final technological era. The reasons for this are two-fold: A) Reaching that final era and researching all the upgrades is simply prohibitively expensive, and B) It just makes more sense to strike your enemy before then, fatally, if possible. This makes the late-game content feel a little unnecessary, as you're probably already winning if you can research that final era, and if you're not winning, spending 4,000 food and coin isn't going to make things that much better. The game does mitigate this somewhat, by having a "Revolution" feature, an alternative to the final age-up, which turns all your villager-type units into militia-type units, and also gives you a plethora of new military options for your civ. However, if you're far ahead enough that you can forgo economy entirely, than you probably don't need the feature anyway. Also, it's only available to European civs, so the final age cost problem is still relevant to Asian and Native American civs. Also, unit counters and stats can be difficult to wrap one's head around, as the developers saw fit to give the player the literal math used to determine unit stats. For example, I believe the movement speed for the average footsoldier was 7.25. Not 7, not 8, but a fraction, 7.25. While this may not seem like a major issue, throwing numbers like that at a player makes the game feel less than polished, and also degrades the meaning of the numbers themselves. 7.25 what? And what does it mean when my Musketeer deals 8 damage, but the Hussar it's attacking has 0.20 armor? Does it deflect 0.20 damage? Or 20% damage? The game doesn't tell you, meaning you'll have to examine the numbers closely to determine exact impact of your units against your opponents.\n\nAnachronism: While I will be the first to admit that anachronism in a strategy game isn't that huge an issue, and is in fact, almost to be expected in these kinds of games, the situation here is rather glaring. Granted, the problem is bigger in the first three story campaigns, and I wouldn't mind it quite so much if it were restricted to the game itself only. But c'mon. Having Revolutionary War era musketeers accompany Amelia Black, a railroad owner? And having them in full garb in cutscene? That's the sort of thing that stretches disbelief to the breaking point, and was one of the reasons that those campaigns did not match the quality of the latter five.\n\nOverall Review: It's pretty good. Steam's char. limits are ♥♥♥.","February 22, 2015","true","68.6"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","26","27","2","0"

It is a sequel to the Age of Empires franchise. Age of Empires III: Complete Collection also contains both expansion packs from Age of Empire III.\n\nAge of Empires III saw many improvements and feature upgrades in term of gameplay while retaining the unique play of Age of Empires series. Many new features included are the new home city and card deck. Card deck allows you to call many abilities such as reinforcements of units, resources delivery, unique upgrades delivery and many more from home city to your new colony. Age of Empires III takes place in the new world of America. You will be seeing units such as the Musketeer, Dragoon, Minuteman and many cannons. Another new features added here is a trade post. Trade post can be built on trade routes or local tribes such as the Aztec to gain their allegiance and lets you train their unique units.\n\nGraphics in Age of Empires III is definitely far better improved and upgraded than the previous Age of Empires, far better effects, models and textures, shaders, everything is beautiful and fully detailed in this game. Performance is also great, no issues that can ruin your play.\n\nSeeing that many Microsoft games such as the Age of Empires II or Age of Mythology has been upgraded with Steamworks feature, Age of Empire III should see that support too, since this is the latest Age of Empire series.\n\nAge of Empire III: Complete Collection is a great game to play, I recommend this.\n\nRating 9/10","December 6, 2014","true","6.5"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","3"

Many hours haven't even been logged on Steam for my current account due to owning two accounts with AoE3 on it. Since good RTS seem limited to Starcraft and Warcraft, I like more realism and history than a fantasy universe. The art and graphics (if that is your main focus) are beautiful. Units work create formations which I have always enjoyed in a RTS. Gathering materials is pretty basic, wood, gold, food, and balancing everything is not too stressful which is great for any strategy game. I also enjoy the way the different difficulties are set. Easy being easy enough to learn and still win and Normal seeming challenging. There is a sandbox mode which is great for people learning the game as well and dont wish to focus on combat.\n\nFor single player, Age of Empires 3 has a genius combination of history, customization, and RTS. I make myself sick of this game and even if I stop for a few months I WILL be back.\n\nCons (without bias) :\nLet me start with the warning alert. Over and over you will hear this as long as you are being attacked and not watching that area. It causes me to mute my game when there are multiple battles. Not fun.\nIt seem frusturating laggy during combat and this is because of units being in formation. Getting used to a combination of different unit speeds makes you break up your selection. Being that realistic is not fun to a lot of people. Single player doesn't hold your hand during the "tutorial" portion. They expect you to know a bit about RTS already.\nThe ships are terrible in huge groups which they make up for in speed.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pokkevillage/recommended/105450/","pokkevillage","Arthalos","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pokkevillage/","6 products in account","The game that reassigned the life goals of thousands of angry real-time strategy nerds who relentlessly blasted death metal out of their sterephones while molesting the taunt buttons when it first came back - is still alive and well. That is, perhaps not so much as when it first premiered, but AoE 3 still attracts a considerable amount of gamers which is impressive given how the strategy gaming industry was completely dwarfed with upsurge of other games is latter years.\n\nThere's not much of a gripe you can hold against this now-classic: the texture and gameplay is focused and realistic, in startling contrast to the puerile graphics of the prequel (although I won't hold back that Age 2 also rocked) as well as the addition of the home city, which granted a completely new dynamic to the game. As is the problem with most strategy games, the inherently incoherent AI (some kind of stratagem devised by evil game planners to render games inconsistent and all puddy) is a bit problematic, but it's still something that can be coped with. The Online could definitely use some revitalizations, though. Yeah, everyone knows Ensemble Studios called it quits years ago, but still... can't someone do something to add some color to the online community and gameplay? The lack of updates is unnerving.\n\nHowever, AoE retains its place as one of the best RTS games, ever. Even the two expansion packs kicked ♥♥♥. Asian Dynasties in particular added an exotic and 'colonial' palette to the game that made it even more memorable for me. The addition of three new factions (China, India, Japan) certainly made the game the well-nigh perfect, multinational, multi-tactical strategy delight.\n\nSo without further ado, here's what you would expect from AoE 3:\n\n1)Strategy rampage.\n\n2)Fast-as-♥♥♥♥ cavalry running down your hapless peasants.\n\n3)Slow-as-dirt peasants 'collecting' resources.\n\n4)No corpses.\n\n5)Finding a mother♥♥♥♥ing enemy base near your town center just because you didn't have a proper sight.\n\n6)Wreckage.\n\n7)Learning the basic words for most languages.\n\n8)General ♥♥♥♥ed-upedness on the battlefield when your batallion of musketeers get creamed by a few cannons.\n\n9)Magical unicorn-horses attached to artillery that appear whenever the artillery piece has to be carried and disappear when you start shootin'.\n\n10)Free geography, history and zoology lessons.\n\n11)Free philosophy lessons from Monks or other atavistic religious dudes whom you'll name after your ex-girlfriend's pet iguana - who can literally outwit their opponents by a having a thick-as-♥♥♥♥ smoke (did they even have that stuff in China back then?) .\n\n12)Flying numbers.\n\n13)Paying attention to the meticulous numerical details of every unit until you realize that your horde of 100 pikemen can be ♥♥♥♥ed by a pack of rockets.\n\n14)Epic flanking action.\n\n15)Facing stubborn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s who wouldn't give in even after you've destroyed their town centers.\n\n16)Taunts! (number 15 in particular)\n\n17)Witnessing the beauty of a New England forest until ramming it down with a barrage of mortars.\n\n18)Imperialism. Exploitation.\n\n19)Where every Wall Street magnate begins: the 100 wood market.\n\n20)Stupid ♥♥♥♥ing peasants getting stuck in between the buildings that they built.\n\n21)Tresures guarded by wolves, dogs, jaguars and other animals who pack a serious punch.\n\n22) Treasures that can be literally collected by empty ships (because ♥♥♥♥ you that's why) .\n\n23)Literally immortal colony explorers who yell like 9-year-old ♥♥♥♥♥es when they 'die' and start clutching their stomachs in agony as if they're on their period.\n\n24)Stupid ♥♥♥♥ing population limits.\n\n25)Villagers that sigh for unexplained reasons whenever they spawn.\n\n26)Realizing that the narrator from the tutorial is the same guy as Arkantos fron Age of Mythology!\n\nAnd so forth. It's a fun ride. You'll learn along the way.\nSo yeah, go buy the game. It's not like you've anything better to do.","January 19, 2015","true","158.1"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","93","14","15","11","3"

There is an abundance of units and buildings, and the game is fast-paced. The graphics are amazing even today, AoE III is one of the best looking RTS games I've seen. The multiplayer is well alive even today, after so many years. I definitely recommend getting this game for every RTS fan.

After playing a substantial amount of AoE2HD, I thought I knew the system pretty well and there wouldn't be a shock to the system.\n\nWell..\n\nThis third installment of the series was actually quite surprising, obviously there is the update in graphics, which is really smooth and eye-pleasing. Some of the games mechanics change too, gone are the days of clusters of gold and stone, mining camps and the like, it's been simplified so that all you need are settlers (Villagers). There's also a system where the player can use a card deck for a civilisation that bring in certain imports, such as food crates, siege equipment or units. This spices things up because to unlock these, you must gain XP (another new addition), this is done by killing enemy units, or building trading posts along trade routes or next to native hamlets.\n\nBasically, if you like the Age of Empires series, get this game (Preferably on sale, as it's bloody expensive when it isn't)\n\nRating - 8/10 Tentacles","December 28, 2014","true","3.6"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Loved AoE 2 especially! Now coming to this one I wouldn't say its perfect as there are many new additions which is a mixed bag but overall I liked this game after spending some time.\n\nPlayed all of the AoE games and I would happily place this at the second place after AoE 2 HD.\n\nCampaign: Campaign in short is okay but mind you I didn't complete it though. Its not easy either but it just didn't feel interesting enough to me so as of now I have yet to complete it. So take someone elses opinion regarding the Campaign.\n\nMultiplayer: The multiplayer community is decently active, around 1300 to 1500 players are online on most weekends. Multiplayer is also one of the strongest points of this game as with 2 or 3 players against 'expert' mode Bots it can be really fun while being challenging and you can 'master' the game more quickly by playing with veteran players! So I recommend playing Multiplayer if you get the game. If the ESO Servers are down for some reason you can still play multiplayer on Gameranger and Voobly. Some dedicated players play there exclusively.\n\nConclusion: Besides the Multiplayer the Skirmish Mode can also be challenging and decently fun to play. Other than that all I would say in the end is that I can definitely recommend this game when on sale to those looking for a RTS to play with friends. Yes this game has some bugs on more recent Operating Systems like Windows 10 though it can be fixed.\n\nAlso there are some issues like path finding and builders getting stuck after building structures though it can be taken care of if you build your Empire a little spread out rather can cramping your structures while making sure you have it well defended with castles on all sides.\n\nNOTE : When you click on the 'Play' Button it will give you several options like AoE: Complete Edition, War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties etc. The full game with all the expansions is the Asian Dynasties option not the Complete Edition option ironically!\n\nAlso for Windows users while you would expect Steam Overlay like every other game here it doesn't works for this game unless you run Steam in Administrator Mode though it depends on your UAC settings.","December 21, 2015","true","97.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/recommended/105450/","ajpos","Andy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ajpos/","483 products in account","Age of Empires 3 is the third and (seemingly) final game in the Age of Empires series. If you  don't know already, it's a traditional real-time-strategy game set in the colonial and imperial ages of European history, with a little of flair of Asia for kicks. Although Age of Empires games traditionally feature a very strong campaign, the replay factor in AOE is always the multiplayer and skirmish options, and this time players are given a multitude of options to suit their gameplay preferences. As a "turtle" (high defense, weak offense) player, I especially like the "treaty" mode, which turns off combat for a set number of minutes at the beginning of each round and also forces players to build their base within a confined space during that time period. As with previous games in the series, AoE3 features 4 different "age" milestones that allow your civilization to access new technologies and units.\n\nThe Good:\n\n* Trading cards enabled.\n\n* Different civilizations, especially those from different continents, have entirely separate styles of play, giving the game different "flavors" of play and replayability.\n\n* Rather than just giving each civilization unique units and technologies, AOE3 takes "Uniqueness" a step further by giving every play 21 "bonus cards," which can be used to dramatically alter your play choices. Two players can conceivably play as the same civilization and require completely different strategies and playstyles due to the bonuses given to them by their cards.\n\n* Vastly more multiplayer options than the predecessors in the series.\n\n* Some Civs, such as the Sioux, are fairly simplistic. This is a positive attribute as it allows differently-skilled players to enjoy the game in their own way.\n\n* There is a "home city building" side-game that is a little enjoyable.\n\nThe Bad:\n\n* I feel like a game that supports 1000+ units on the screen and 1920x1080 resolution should let me zoom the map out a bit further. My town center annoyingly takes up way too much of my view!\n\n* No Steam achievements.\n\n* Antiquated map controls - the only way to scroll the map is by moving your cursor to the edge of the screen. RTS games should support WASD map scrolling and/or click 'n' drag.\n\n* The final "age" is rarely ever needed in a match, and costs more than it benefits your team, in my opinion.\n\n* Map-editing is nowhere near as easy and intuitive as it was in previous AOE games.\n\n* Weak AI. It seems like a 1 vs. 1 AI opponent always focuses strictly on cavalry, which in turn focuses me to only focus on building one type of unit.\n\n\nThe Ugly:\n\n* Horribly WRONG launcher screen. When starting the game, you are given the choice of loading (a) Age of Empires III: Complete Collection, (b) Age of Empires III: The War Chiefs, and (c) Age of Empires III: Asian Dynasties. However, option "A" is not complete at all: choosing it gives you access to neither of the two expansions. Option B gives you access to the War Chiefs Expansion (but not Asian Dynasties), and Option C gives you access to ALL game content: the base game and both expansions.\n\n* Not as fun as AOE2. A sequal should be a step forward, not a step back. The differences are noticeable in all sorts of small areas, which individually would not be a problem, but lend to an overall diminished quality. Some examples are unit formations being nowhere near as "tight," and units having a tendency to WALK into battle if they are grouped with a slower unit.\n\nThe Verdict:\n\n* At the time of this writing, the base price for AO3 is $39.99. That is overpriced, especially since AO2-HD is a more solid and overall better game and comes for the same base price. However, I do think AOE3 is worth checking out if you can get it on sale. I have had a lot of fun with this game, perhaps 100 hours or so, before it ever became available on Steam. But now that AO2-HD has come out, I see little reason to play AO3.","December 25, 2013","true","25.9"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","12","15","0","0"

These include the Germans, Spanish, British, Asian civs,  Native American civs, and a lot more. Each have their own strategies. In the game, you are pitted against another Civ(s), whether it be an AI or an actual player. Your civilization's economy relies on 3 things: food, wood, and coin. Your villagers, or workers, must work to gather these resources and build your colony. You can use the resources to create buildings, buy improvements, and train an army.\n\nEventually, you'll need an army. There are infantry, calvalry, and artillery units. You can also have naval battles with various ships if there is a body of water on the map. As mentioned before, there are numerous strategies for victory. I'd recommend trying out all the Civilizations and see which one you feel most comfortable with.\n\nOverall, this game is godly. It will stand the test of time, and I hope that the online service will remain available for years to come (after all, it still has a sizable community).\n\nP.S.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pbjt566/recommended/105450/","Pbjt566","Pbjt566","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Pbjt566/","73 products in account","It should be known by now that I've been a fan of the Age games from way back. There's just something about the historical nature of the games that appeals to me. To be fair, I think elves and space marines are neat too, but I think it's more exciting to explore the what ifs of real, historical situations. Though not quite as faithful to "reality" as some strategy games, the first two Age games offered us exciting sojourns into the worlds of "capital A" Ancient and Medieval strategy. The third title, Age of Mythology, proved that the mechanics were just as solid even if the historical inspiration was a little loose.\n\nNow Ensemble is back on the history train with the third official Age of Empires game. Age of Empires III moves the action to the New World, letting players lead a variety of European nations from the Age of Discovery through the Industrial Age. Eight playable nations battle across a wide variety of geographies -- from the swamps of Florida to the snowy passes of the Rocky Mountains. Players can recruit different Native American tribes and seize control of various trade routes. Material and technological support will be offered by the player's home city back in Europe.\n\nThe 24-mission campaign is very well designed. Divided into three large acts, it tells the story of three generations of the Black family. First Morgan Black, a Knight of St. John races to the New World to stop the Spanish from seizing a powerful natural wonder. Next, Morgan's grandson John and his Native American allies find themselves in the Seven Year's War. The final act shows John's granddaughter Amelia as the head of a railroad company making their way west.\n\nI won't spoil the particulars of the story here but a common quest and a common enemy unite all three acts. The connections aren't always clear at first, but the associations start to build as the game goes on. Putting the pieces together isn't terribly hard but it gives a nice sense of purpose to the whole game and keeps you invested in the action.\n\nWhile we're talking about the game's story, it's refreshing to see a game that covers this era of warfare without referencing either Napoleon or the American Revolution. While both are fertile ground for strategy game developers, it's nice to get something a little different this time around. Meeting Washington and Bolivar and taking part in the Seven Year's War adds a little authenticity as well as variety. On the other hand, some of the choices -- like finding Russians in Colorado -- may leave gamers scratching their heads in wonder.\n\nThe range of missions is pretty broad. There are plenty of defense missions where you have to protect a given structure or a whole town from enemy assault. In other cases you'll have to destroy or capture key structures. Along the way there are plenty of other objectives: rescuing captured settlers, seizing trading posts, liberating Native American settlements and a whole host of other tasks. Better still, many missions combine a variety of these objectives at once. While most of the missions let you build a base and start collecting resources, there are some missions where you have to make do with a set number of troops.\n\nOutside of the single player campaign, Age of Empires III benefits from a very soild multiplayer interface. A few simple clicks take you to ESO2, Ensemble's online matchmaking service. Finding and joining games is remarkably easy and there are a wide variety of options to choose from. Different starting eras and resource levels will let players jump into as advanced a game as they want. The AI offers up a few taunts from time to time to (sort of) replicate the personality of a human player. It's a nice trick honestly.\n\nIn general the AI is very strong. You can find some exploits here and there but, for the most part, the AI knows how to make a good army and how to lead it. While the computer opponents in some RTS games send out trickles of units from time to time in order to keep things interesting, the AI in Age of Empires III tends to rely more on groups of units and will hardly ever use them in pointless, suicide attacks. In my games the AI has had a good handle on when to press an attack and when to retreat. The only real weak point in the AI is its tendency to leave some of its settlers too isolated. (Since there are no resource dropsites anymore, it's also hard for human players to keep tabs on where all their settlers are.)\n\nThe range of technologies and units is relatively broad here. In the early ages, players will have to make do with troops that are very similar to the medieval set from Age of Empires II. Crossbows eventually give way to muskets as the ages pass by. Soon players will be fielding long lines of musketeers and using mortars to bombard enemy towers. While it may seem that some of the unit types are redundant, you'll find that each type has a specific role to play on the battlefield. Like the other Age games you'll have a variety of ranged and melee-focused cavalry and infantry as well as a nice range of artillery units. Identifying the counter units and building a balanced force is just as important as knowing where and when to strike the enemy.\n\nLike the rest of the games in the Age series, the naval element is merely there to support the land battles. The handful of ships and maritime technologies don't offer many options. You will find that the naval side of the game is fairly compelling early on while you're dealing with pirates and chasing your enemies across the Atlantic. Once you start fighting in the interior of the American continent, you won't really miss the naval aspect of the game as much.\n\nPathfinding seems to be a bit of a problem here and there. Huge formations can easily find their way through the most densely packed settlements but my one hero unit can't seem to find his way out of the middle of a line of infantry. There are cases where the pathfinding is a little too good. Units are able to predict the best routes through a maze even when large parts of that maze haven't been uncovered yet. This is most telling during missions where you're leading a small force through a series of winding canyons. As long as you click on their eventual destination, they'll make their way through the labyrinth with nary a wrong turn.\n\nWhile we're on the subject, it seems odd that you can't select a single unit out of a group by clicking on their portrait at the bottom of the screen. Trying to grab a specific hero unit out of a large formation should be easier than this. Luckily, there's an option in the game to disregard any non-combat units when you click and drag to select a group. This helps to keep your settlers from marching out with your soldiers.\n\nAge of Empires III also introduces some new elements -- home cities, native tribes, trade routes and such. Taken individually none of these are profound innovations but their cumulative effect makes the game feel fresh and strengthens the appeal of the core design. So in total of this review, I recommend this game to anyone who loves RTS Games.","December 6, 2014","true","26.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","2"

The conventional thinking is that Age of Empires II is the "best," but the truth is that Age of Empires III is actually the best.\n\nI'll make it simple. Age of Empires III is better because it's newer and it's more of a game and less of a time killer. There is actually a single-player with a real story to the campaign. There are a ton of different units in the game and I haven't even gotten to the DLC yet. This version is more fast-paced and is equally as fun on land as it is on water.\n\nThere is one issue that isn't major, but it kind of is for me. That is the game hasn't been updated in a while and doesn't allow for steam overlay (shift+tab) and does not contain any achievements. I'm not sure if the game supports 4K either.\n\nI am using WIndows 10 with a GTX 970 and i5-4466. There are absolutely no technical hiccups and the game runs very smooth.\n\nOverall, great game that surpasses Age of Empires II in every way while looking GREAT for its age. Also, no major bugs or compatibility issues with Windows 10.

The new game picks up where Age of "Empires II: Age of Kings" left off, placing gamers in the position of a European power determined to explore, colonize and conquer the New World. This time period features stunning scenes, from towering European cathedrals to courageous tribes of Native Americans, and spectacular combat with Industrial Age units like rifled infantry, cavalry and tall ships bristling with cannons. Age of Empires III excites strategy gamers with new game-play elements, including the concept of a "Home City," new civilizations, units, technologies and an immersive new single-player campaign that will span three generations.\nRecommendation: I crucially recommend this game to all Strategic game lovers :)","January 14","true","11.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatSexyChineseGuy/recommended/105450/","ThatSexyChineseGuy","HK | Immi 我暗戀你","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatSexyChineseGuy/","29 products in account","Addressing Concers for the Game\n\nThis reaches back to memories. I remember playing this game back when I was a kid. It was either my first or second RTS game that I still play even today. There are balancing problems, but I'm not the guy who favors the idea of balancing. However, it is worth noting that there are problems with certain civilations within the game as I spend the majority of my time in the multiplayer.\n\nMultiplayer Civilation Problems/Underdogs/My Opinion and Concerns\nSome civilations, even through balancing with the popuation and resources, are just underdogs on their economy or just plain tough suckers who are hard to kill. An example of this are the Azetcs and the French. The Azetcs have food eco. power, but they lack in earning gold to pay for required units to counter such others. The French have an elite calvary that my cost alot in food, gold, and population. However, even that balancing doesn't stop them from being massively produced quickly and used effienctly. It becomes a redundant tactic to use in multiplayer games. Other civilations also have such advantages like the Russians using advance formations with seige calvary surrounding a horse archer to form a compact square formation in treaty games. This would generally cause massive economic damages and strategic disappointment for the opposing team. There are more in the game, but these are just a few examples.\n\nUnit Combat/Understanding of the Units\nThe game has unit balancing that kills the reality of what would really happen at the time, but I don't blame them for that balancing. An example is that a lightly armored unit can be have resistance to guns and arrows, and the same can be side to heavly armored Chinese units. I'm not saying that all firearms and archaic bows can break through dense armor, but I believe that the game should be updated to the point where things can make some sense and use. This is because that every unit within the game have only one resistance to a certain type of attack. There is the seige, the ranged, and the melee attack. Each has a different use and affect on certain units. There are even other units that can absorb lots of balls from muskeets and still not die. Even when they are lightly armored. I do want to note and point out my understanding that the game is an old RTS from 2005 with a golden RTS combat system, but looking at this just breaks my reality I put in the game.\n\nEconomy\nEach and every map in the game that are offical are designed differently with certain arount of food (animals/berries/treasures), gold (mines/treasures), and wood (trees). In addition, there are certain sites that can improve the players economy, such as trading posts. Do you that everything that is "natural" in the map is a consumable.  So, this makes them a nonreliable source of income. To further worsen this, they are all spread out through out the map. This stress the player to try to control the map and protect their gathers from hurrassments, which is what I like. What I don't like is that when the map runs out of trees, I have to rely on trading at the market. The market is a building that is used to upgrade your gathers to increase gathering rate. In the game, upgrades will generally consume two of the resources (food,wood, or gold) to perform upgrade for combat unit, gathering, minor improvements, and etc. Now, the problem with every map in the game is when the trees are all gone. Wood is esstential for constructing buildings and certain units. When wood is gone, this causes the player to rely on the markets or vulgar production from factions, trading post, and wood producing units. They don't produce a decent needed amount that is need for the battle. This makes pikemen and longbows useless; one of the few units that can counter French calvary are upgraded pikemen. Some civilations don't need to worry about wood income like Japan. Their shrines can generate a lot when upgraded and max. However, for them to generate more they need animals. In standard games, Japan is a faction that you might not want in your team due the fact that some players will generally take animals you use as food for their purposes. When that happens, you can't kill the animal for food. They are protected by the shrine from being killable or taken. This leads to another topic about popuation that I'll explain about later; Japan has a small limit of the amount of villagers that can produce. Back to topic, this causes Japan to become dependent on animals and other players to produce domesticated animals for them.\n\nEven more...\nHome cities are cities that provide aid to the player in the game. They do so by shipping passive upgrades that are unique to certain civilations, standard upgrades, consumbles, units, buildings, or ships for the cost of points(levels). Points are earned by reaching a ceratin xp (level (> or = to) xp). Xp is earned naturally, produced, or in bountry of a unit's death. Not all civilations can have passive upgrades to improve their economy to a decent or dramatic advantage. Take a look at the Aztecs. They can bloom their food production so well, but lacking in gold production to train certain units. To make this even worse for them, they can't have access to resource production type buildings or enchance to gathering like the Indians. Same can be said about all Native American civilations, and their firepits can screw up their uses of villagers in desprite times.\n\nPopulation\nMost Civilations have a popuation limit. This is a balance to pervent overwhelming quanity of units that we are all not interesting in coming at use. However, the there are limits in the amount of units each civilations have train. Most civilations can train upto 99 villagers/settlers/gathers (the three are interchangable). However, those who gets a benefits on their economy has a reduction to the amount of villagers they can have. This is a balance to pervent massive generation of income for a civilation. Do know that there are ways to lose a game. One of them is lose all your gathers, your town center, and your hero. So, those with lower villager counts are in a risk if they aren't protected.\n\nWhat I like:Decent Amount of Civilations\nDecent Amount of Units\nAdvance Formations Options\nGood Options/Setting for a 2005 Game\nA Stable Way of Income\nMap Control is Key\nUnit Combat is Okay\nVillager Gathering is Okay\nCivilations are uniqueWhat I want... Updates maybe and less redundant actions in the game? If you guys have any concerns about stuff you want me to address I'll add them below here.

Many people recommended this game and when I saw it on sale I gave it a shot.\n\nBasically, this game is like European Wars : Cossacks. Old style RTS.\n\nThe only downside to this Age of Empires versus the second is the way you can choose formations in the second. It felt overall the second had more to control whereas the third sort of simplified things and tried to make the game easier and smoother. AoE 3 is your typical RPG, offering peasants (or settlers), militias, markets, church's, walls and gates to protect your city. I really can't see all the hype about this game to be truthful as everyone says. Yes the campaign stories are good, but I find that this game doesn't really set itself apart from other RTS's.\n\nIf I had a choice between playing European Wars : Cossacks or this - I would most likely choose EW : Cossacks. Not to say that this game is bad, but the options that are given in EW far outweigh those of AoE for me.\n\nI would give it an 8 if it had something to differentiate itself from other RTS of it's class, but\n\n7.7/10.","August 1, 2014","true","7.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The combat is more intense, more diverse, and much more realistic than that of the original two Age of Empires games, which were already great. The interface has been updated and greatly improved (only three resources allow for a smoother process of building and running your civilation).\n\nThe game has many great new features, including:\n-use of a "home city", a city you customize and level up through battle, that serves as your main menu and gives rewards\n-ability to train troops in groups of five, instead of individually\n-random capturable treasures scattered around the map that give unique bonuses\n-more realistic battle (soldiers burn buildings instead of hit them, cannonballs knock down trees, ships sink, etc)\n-awesome revamped naval combat. Limited fleet size allow more tactical fighting strategies\n-unit special abilities. these vary greatly, providing a single powerful shot, treasure gaurdian taming, stealth, etc.\n-ability to build trade posts to ally with native americans, providing unique/powerful upgrades and native units\n-use of limited and highly-profitable trade posts along a railroad, which are visciously fought over\n-unique use of ability cards, picked outside of battle, and used during game for special advantages\n-highly diverse wild animals to fight, hunt, and tame. Tamable ones includes wolves, coyotes, bears, cougars, and more.\n-interesting and useful incorporation of time-period features, including minute-men, trains, native allies, and more.\n-addition of artillery units (various cannons) that add a unique element to combat\n-(with Asian Dynasties expansion) ability to play as one of three native American tribes (Sioux, Aztec, and one other)\n\n\nThings I do not like about this game:\n-population size still limited to 200 units\n-artillery is a bit overpowered (specifically anti-infantry artillery, though it is more realistic that way)\n\nIn short, if you are a fan of the original two AoE games, love historical time period-set war games, like strategy combat, or just want to have some great fun on an amazingly underrated and easy-to-learn game, buy Age of Empires III now. And while you're at it, the expansions are great and well worth the money.\n\n9.5/10 - Highly, highly recommended.","October 2, 2014","true","11.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It is a well balanced masterpiece with plenty to do that will keep you busy for hours. Well balanced as in, it has that mixture to where it isn't too militaristic. You spend a lot of time improving your economy. Between building your Empire, leveling and customizing your home city, and developing new technologies, you'll be hard crossed to go to bed at a decent time. It has multiplayer, thirty or so maps, a scenario editior, and twelve unique nations ranging from the powerful British Empire to the traditional Japanese. This game is beautiful, even on my potato battery laptop. I've been in love with this game since 2005. I lost my retail copy so i was thrilled when it was added to the Steam Store.

Yes, that places it infront of other video game giants, including Arma, Warband, Civilization, and perhaps more appropriately, Age of Empires 2.\n\nIt's not the graphics... it's definately not the graphics. They're not bad per se, in fact they are sometimes beautiful, but compared to the standard rts of today, they probably rank 4 or 5 out of 10.\n\nAoE 3 is my favorite game because it's *fun*. Over the last decade or so, I've loved and then grown tired of dozens of games, Fallout 4 being the most recent victim. Age 3, however, is always fun. AI provides a challenge, the community is still amazingly friendly and going strong, there are tournaments where you can win cash prizes, plenty of mods, and a quite large amount of diverse factions. When you drop yourself into a game, both single and multiplayer, it's an engaging experience every time. Honestly, I can't even find the words to explain why it's always so fun, it just is. Perhaps it's the historical care given to each unit, or maybe the ridiculous cheats and snarky comments of the AI, I don't know. If I said every game was completely unique, I'd be lying; but that's not a problem, because Age 3 does what works.\n\nI usually don't like writing reviews, especially ones over 9 words, but this game deserves at least a little bit of support from me. It's the least I can do for the most captivating game on the steam market.","November 26, 2015","true","116.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","7","10","0","0"

Because of this the idea of a powerful RPG-like "hero" unit is not only heretical it's illogical and goes against the concept itself, does it work in aoe3?\n\nIt doesn't and it does.\nIt's not really an actual hero, it's an explorer unit that you can use for scouting or for clearing "creep camps" that give you a bit (or a lot, if the camp is big) of resources that you can use to strengthen your army, or build buildings.\nOther than clearing "monsters" the hero can build trading posts, these can be used to connect to neutral camps that give you a (weak) unit to train and (sometimes good) improvements for your economy, or travel routes which give you experience and this connects us to the next part the "trading cards" system:\n\nThe experience points you gain through certain buildings don't go to your hero or any unit in your army, but instead allow you to receive "shipments" from the mainland. Meaning you can get moscow/amsterdam/istanbul (or whatever your home city is) to send you a shipment of resources, extra villagers, buildings, improvements, entire armies to help you fight.\n\nAoe2 (and aoe) while fun in its own way, suffered from its length, only at 10 minutes you get to age up, aoe3 uses the above to "fix" that, with enough skill, by 10 minutes you might hit the last age.\n\nNot everybody can get there, but it's possible.\n\nOther than the several races, the shipment system can be edited allowing for a deeply personalized "deck" and gameplay style, takes a while to get used to, but the standard deck isn't painful to play with either.\n\nThe servers work, and people still play, there's a consistent community that still gets to hone their skills.\n\ndo you recommend this game?\nNot for 30 dollars, but the game goes on sale pretty regularely, get it then, it's well worth it if you want a faster  (but by no means simpler) age of empires title.","February 22","true","13.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

THIS GAME!\n\nThis game is phenomenal! The RTS genre wasn't my favorite type of game (I didn't even want anyrthing to do with it before) but when my friend recommended this game to me I decided to try it out. And, surprise surprise, I love it! I haven't even touched the scenarios yet and I'm having a blast with this game! This is an amazing game to play with friends and maybe alone if you're just wanting to chill and listen to music or a podcast to.\n\nThe strength of this game is the jump from AoE II's graphics and gameplay. Now, I'm not one to base a game on it's looks because I love AoE II and Rise of Nations as well, but the graphical change give this game a refreshing look to it when you play. But gameplay from AoE II hasn't change a whole lot but has changed a little. The only difference is that A.) You can't build mines next to a silver or gold ore vein, and B.) You can't build a wood mill next to a forest that you're gathering wood from. Now I like that it is a faster and cheeper process to gather wood and gold fast but wood can be scarce at times and the fact that you cannot upgrade your wood gathering speed until the V age kinda bothered me at first, but then I messed around with my 'deck' in the game and by god:\n\nTHE DECK FEATURE IS AMAZING!\n\nThe Deck is practically bonus cards that you can use to help benefit you in certain points of the game and can be used either once or infinently and are spread across different era's in the game, for example; The faster wood gathering perk card can be used once and can (possibly) be obtained in the I era, but the faster gold gathering perk may possibly be obtainable in the II era.\n\nBut for the closing of the AoE III review I have to say this: this game is by far my favorite RTS on the market right now! I was skeptical about it at first, but I'm glad I bought it! I recommend to everybody!\n\nThis game from me gets a 9/10!

This game is brilliant, although the AI may be silly at times *cough, Napolean* it still has unique gameplay and good graphics, as well a Pretty decent uprgade system. I loved the fact that different units would take up a certain amount of population, e.g. A dragoon would take up 2 population where as apose to a musketeer taking up 1. There is a huge variety of map choices and with the Asian dynasties pack and The war cheifs DLC, the selection choices are endless, they vary from the Amazon River, The Andes, Anywhere in the America's and even the Asian Maps.\n\nWhat I love most though is the story based campaigns, I have finished the Asian one's which I find very addicting, but the way the whole plot goes together makes it so intresting, the characters always serve a unique purpose on the battlefeild, + they are well designed.\n\nMy favourte part in my Japanese campaign, was when I sent a group of Ninjas into the enemy base using stealth mode, to assassinate the leading daimyo, Immedialty after his death, a rebellion started and I gained control of most of the map. :P +1 Bodygaurds\n\nBoromir approves 9.5/10","December 9, 2014","true","19.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/milesofbaloney/recommended/105450/","milesofbaloney","Мilo of Lombardy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/milesofbaloney/","80 products in account","Pointless nostalgic intro\nBack in 2005, when AoE III was released, I'd already been playing the 2nd for several years. Being an amateur and enthusiast of medieval warfare, the period of time didn't seem too appealing to me. Moreover, I was so used to the iconic 2D graphics of the first 2 AoE titles, that I couldn't join yet the revolution Age of Mythology had started some time earlier.\n\nThen, I found a torrent for the vanilla plus TWC somewhere in 2009 or '10 and it didn't took a while before I developed a passion for the game. But enough of my personal history and feelings with the game's series.\n\nActual review and rating\nI rate the whole expanded game 8/10*. If I were you I would wonder what's wrong with the game so that you didn't rate it 10/10? The main reason I didn't entirely like AoE III was:\n\n-Lack of deep european theatre\nWhich subsequently implies the game lacks the following content (more or less):\n\n-European maps and respective natives (local inhabitants that commonly formed regional cultures)\n-European conflicts within Europe (like the Napoleonic Wars)\n-European major factions/civilisations like the Austrians, the Swede, the Poles, the HRE, and so on\n-European "minor" factions between which most of the mentioned-above conflicts occured (e.g. the thirty years' war?)\n-I could go on for ages\n\n*I rate the vanilla 7/10, and Asian Dynasties 9/10. I liked the accuracy and dedication towards the Asian cultures and peoples, perhaps the crappiest part was that they didn't bother changing the town noise and sounds at all. I cannot say anything about the Warchiefs because I played the native factions very little and am myself not-so experienced with (post-colonisation) north and mesoamerican civilisations.\n\nMany by now are probably already thinking that the review is pointless because "muh europe", but hey, we successfully founded the first advanced civilisations, kingdoms and later empires - ultimately colonising the world. So, whether you like that or not it's history, and we're a large part of it.\n\nAnyway, if you want to know how good the game is, just read older and more rated reviews. I can simply tell you that if you're looking after a traditional RTS set right after the middle ages until the beginning of the 19th century, you won't be disappointed at all.\n\nIn case you agree with me on the lack of the European content, I highly recommend you install the Napoleonic Era mod[www.ne.elpea.net]. It adds some 5/6 factions and a bunch of units, maps, etc. It also has a small online community.","February 20, 2015","true","98.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/milesofbaloney/recommended/105450/","milesofbaloney","Мilo of Lombardy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/milesofbaloney/","80 products in account","Pointless nostalgic intro\nBack in 2005, when AoE III was released, I'd already been playing the 2nd for several years. Being an amateur and enthusiast of medieval warfare, the period of time didn't seem too appealing to me. Moreover, I was so used to the iconic 2D graphics of the first 2 AoE titles, that I couldn't join yet the revolution Age of Mythology had started some time earlier.\n\nThen, I found a torrent for the vanilla plus TWC somewhere in 2009 or '10 and it didn't took a while before I developed a passion for the game. But enough of my personal history and feelings with the game's series.\n\nActual review and rating\nI rate the whole expanded game 8/10*. If I were you I would wonder what's wrong with the game so that you didn't rate it 10/10? The main reason I didn't entirely like AoE III was:\n\n-Lack of deep european theatre\nWhich subsequently implies the game lacks the following content (more or less):\n\n-European maps and respective natives (local inhabitants that commonly formed regional cultures)\n-European conflicts within Europe (like the Napoleonic Wars)\n-European major factions/civilisations like the Austrians, the Swede, the Poles, the HRE, and so on\n-European "minor" factions between which most of the mentioned-above conflicts occured (e.g. the thirty years' war?)\n-I could go on for ages\n\n*I rate the vanilla 7/10, and Asian Dynasties 9/10. I liked the accuracy and dedication towards the Asian cultures and peoples, perhaps the crappiest part was that they didn't bother changing the town noise and sounds at all. I cannot say anything about the Warchiefs because I played the native factions very little and am myself not-so experienced with (post-colonisation) north and mesoamerican civilisations.\n\nMany by now are probably already thinking that the review is pointless because "muh europe", but hey, we successfully founded the first advanced civilisations, kingdoms and later empires - ultimately colonising the world. So, whether you like that or not it's history, and we're a large part of it.\n\nAnyway, if you want to know how good the game is, just read older and more rated reviews. I can simply tell you that if you're looking after a traditional RTS set right after the middle ages until the beginning of the 19th century, you won't be disappointed at all.\n\nIn case you agree with me on the lack of the European content, I highly recommend you install the Napoleonic Era mod[www.ne.elpea.net]. It adds some 5/6 factions and a bunch of units, maps, etc. It also has a small online community.","February 20, 2015","true","98.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Ships are big and beefy, cannons are cannons that do huge damage and splash and each civilization is unique.\n\nIn AoE 2, you have crossbowmen shooting arrows at stone walls, battering rams hitting farm fields and making them burn, and swordsmen using their swords to beat down structures. In AoE 3, units have their own siege attacks and animations which fix that problem. Every civ's Church or religious building is a different model. Every civ has their own unique units and tech trees.\n\nThe Explorer is your colony's leader and sort of a hero-like unit from Warcraft 3. You get to explore the map, fight neutrals and claim treasures during the start of the game, which makes games less repetitve and more fun in the beginning.\n\nThe Home City part of the game is awesome. You can send shipments or technologies from your mother country to your colony. Every civ has a ton of different strategies.\n\nEach map is different enough. Most maps have Native people and settlements that you can trade with or ally. Your mother country will give you additional support on some maps, like early shipments or free economic starting buildings. There are also trade routes that you can establish.\n\nThe game has good balance, almost rock-paper-scissors, with various types of infantry, cavalry and artillery. Also, farms and plantations do not need to be 'queued' like in AoE 2, fixing any annoyance from that game.\n\nIn conclusion, AoE 3 is the most improved and well made Age of Empires yet. Every civilization is unique and all the annoying or bad features from the previous Age of Empires series games have been fixed. Each time you play will be different and every civ has different strategies. The maps are all different. My favorite part of the game is the sound of distant artillery, which echoes far!

This was one of the best coupons I've ever received! This is my second favourite strategy game the first is AoE II HD Edition because it's without guns and it's a bit better in my opinion while playing. So AoE III has better graphics and audio than II but not only that the graphics are better but they extremely beautiful. The gameplay is good the missions are neither too easy or too hard i started playing on medium difficulty and its not that hard at the moment. There are added a lot more features to this game like you have levels and you can upgrade your home town + you can receive in-game bonuses to help you defeat your foes. I really recommend this game to all people who like strategy games though it would be better to get it on sale because it's really expensive.

Easy to play, nearly impossible to master.\n\nAlso AI is very good and considering how old this game is the graphics are what you would expect from a new game if you crank the resolution very high and max everything out.

Until I got Civilization V, this game was by far my most played strategy game.  You get to fight in the New World or Asia as you build up resorces, construct an army, and conquer your neighbors!  Though I feel the game should add more factions to play like Sweden, Austria, or Denmark to add to to the already great experience (without the need of a mod) and the ability to fight in Europe!  Also, if you're a person who doesn't like to win legitimently, then look of some of the cheats, the're hilarious!  Also, the AI difficulty is very spaced out between easy, moderate, and hard, unlike some games that have easy WAY too easy, medium has a massive jump from easy, and hard is nearly impossible.

There is a lot less micromanaging of the unenjoyable kind as you can train 5 units at the speed of 1 and villagers don't have to travel back to resource drop off points. It feel more action packed and lacks the dull late game turtling that age of empires 2 would drive to. The AI can be an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥ at times but they can come up with excellent tactical decisions.

When I saw that this collection of third game has appeared on Steam, I didnt hesitate with getting it.\n\nAge of Empires III is a real time strategy game set into colonizing the New World to industrial revolution. Game is divided into Campaign, Skirmish mode and Multiplayer.\n\nCampaign is divided into 3 parts for each expansion and vanilla game.\n\nIn single player skirmish you fight against AI in randomly created maps. After game you gain experience for your home town and get better units and upgrades. It has kind of appealing RPG like system to keep you playing.\n\nMultiplayer is practically same except that you cannot use your home cities and profiles from skirmish to keep the game balanced. Even that I must warn you. Multiplayer is filled with veterans and very experienced players. I recommend to host game with your friends to enjoy the best experience.","October 17, 2013","true","150.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Though it is a great game I feel there is a necessary requirement to enjoying this game. Siblings, family or friends! I have been playing this game with my brothers for many years and it is so much fun backstabbing each other, working together and interacting with each other in a video game. I think of it like a board game, it is most enjoyable to play it with people you know instead of robots or random people because it is a way to bond. There are some solo options but the AI are very predictable, the only other option is ES Online which is hard to use since the game is so dated and few people around the world play making for a lot of lag.

This game summarizes what I love about RTS games. Age of Empires III feels so much like a polished and new Age of Empires II, which is exactly what it should be, and at times, it doesn't even feel like this game was released in 2005.\n\nThis game does most things right, having some flaws in it's gameplay since it's so old and many new games have stepped in and added to the RTS genre. Take this out of concideration (because the game still doesn't feel out-dated to me), and you have one great RTS game well worth it's price even though it's old.","September 19, 2014","true","3.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The improved graphics and gameplay are definitely a step up from the 2nd game in the AoE series. The ships are a lot more realistic in size, and your army sports some new equipment (namely, guns). The one thing that I don't like about this is the resources. For example, in AoE 2, you had to build a mill, and then build farms in order to gather food. You would also have to constantly resupply your farmland. In AoE 3, however, it's more of a one-time-deal; you build a mill, which comes with farmland included, and that's it. You don't have to resupply the mill with more wood to keep the farm going. You can just let it sit there for forever. Now while some people may like this, I personally, am not a huge fan of it as since it makes the game a bit TOO easy. Overall though, definitely still a good game and a worthy buy.","June 26, 2014","true","25.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Expansion Packs were actually expansions that changed the game in multiple ways and added on to the complete/full base form of the game.\n\nWhat I mean is, normally DLC nowadays is required to get the full package of what the final product should've been. AoE3's Expansion Packs ARE NOT DLC. The Expansion Packs in AoE3 add on to the game content enough to make it feel like a different game within a game. The Expansion Packs aren't neccessary to fully enjoy Age of Empires III; however, having them improves upon the player experience greater.","January 8, 2015","true","13.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Embora não tenha jogado o primeiro, AoE 2 foi a minha primeira experiência realmente intensa nos pcs: o primeiro game que me dediquei de fato na nossa querida plataforma. Foi uma grande satisfação quando vi AoE 3 disponível no Steam. Assim como o 2, o 3 também joguei bastante. Contudo, à época, joguei as versões piratas. O legal era que, mesmo sendo pirata, conseguíamos jogar on line. Comprei AoE 3 aqui no Steam em retribuição aos momentos de diversão que me proporcionou no passado (e também por saudosismo). O jogo é um ótimo rts, que permite várias práticas estratégicas. As civilizações são realmente muito distintas umas das outras, cada qual com sua árvore evolutiva própria, o que permite aproveitar o game a partir de várias possibilidades de combates diferentes.  Interessante é que ainda hoje ele possui gráficos muito bons. Ademais, é possível achar na net sites com mapas, campanhas, civilizações e outros mods que acrescentam bastante conteúdo free. Enfim, aconselho a todos que gostem de construir cidades, evolui-las, formar exércitos e ir para o fronte de batalha colocar em prática suas estratégias.","May 28, 2013","true","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I felt that Age of Empires III was by far the best in terms of graphics, but the gameplay for the campaigns seemed a bit shorter than the previous games (at least it felt this way to me). Sometimes a win is determined by who has more resources and is able to get the largest fighting force, while other times you gotta think of the best plan of attack and use what you have to win. I would recomend this game. Now if only they would release Age of Mythology on Steam...that would be amazing; it's my favorite of these games and I do miss it so.","January 18, 2014","true","10.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You can do what ever you feel like. On the other side, the AI is quite persistent. I have had times when they wiped out my partner then nonstop attaked me.

The game features "cards" -upgrades that you can send whenever you reach another experiance tier.  Cards allow you to specialize your nations units, which are sharded between all of the nations, with one or two expections.  There are also playstyle differences between nations, with the ottomans getting free yet slow settlers, or the duty settlers costing gold instead of food.  The core gameplay is similar to AoE 2, other then this new card mechanic and trading posts.  Trading posts can be built on trade routes or on Indian villages.  Both of them are worth it.  Trade routes supply you with either resources or exp, and indian villages grant you powerful units and upgrades.\n\nOverall, it is better then AoE 2, the card system is unique, and it is worth getting.","May 30, 2013","true","135.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I saw that this collection of third game has appeared on Steam, I didnt hesitate with getting it.\n\nAge of Empires III is a real time strategy game set into colonizing the New World to industrial revolution. Game is divided into Campaign, Skirmish mode and Multiplayer.\n\nCampaign is divided into 3 parts for each expansion and vanilla game.\n\nIn single player skirmish you fight against AI in randomly created maps. After game you gain experience for your home town and get better units and upgrades. It has kind of appealing RPG like system to keep you playing.\n\nMultiplayer is practically same except that you cannot use your home cities and profiles from skirmish to keep the game balanced. Even that I must warn you. Multiplayer is filled with veterans and very experienced players. I recommend to host game with your friends to enjoy the best experience.","October 17, 2013","true","150.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I felt that Age of Empires III was by far the best in terms of graphics, but the gameplay for the campaigns seemed a bit shorter than the previous games (at least it felt this way to me). Sometimes a win is determined by who has more resources and is able to get the largest fighting force, while other times you gotta think of the best plan of attack and use what you have to win. I would recomend this game.

There are some memorable battles such as Trenton, and Little big horn(!) to relieve during the expansion, and it definatly makes it worth it to stick it out.\n\nBut, then there is, 'The Asian Dynasties,' which I looked at and said, "How could they link these two games together in one cohesive story?"  The answer is they don't!  And really for the better as each campaign follows seperate leaders as they conquer, explore, or rebel against their enemies.  Ultimately I feel like the AOE series saved one of my favorite campaigns for last in the Indian one.  In the indian campaign you play as a soldier who must choose between military loyality and nationalism for his home land.  The resulting campaign is fun and gives you some level of purpose on building up bases and fighting your enemy.\n\n","November 25, 2013","true","21.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

When I saw that this collection of third game has appeared on Steam, I didnt hesitate with getting it.\n\nAge of Empires III is a real time strategy game set into colonizing the New World to industrial revolution. Game is divided into Campaign, Skirmish mode and Multiplayer.\n\nCampaign is divided into 3 parts for each expansion and vanilla game.\n\nIn single player skirmish you fight against AI in randomly created maps. After game you gain experience for your home town and get better units and upgrades. It has kind of appealing RPG like system to keep you playing.\n\nMultiplayer is practically same except that you cannot use your home cities and profiles from skirmish to keep the game balanced.

I have played this game and AOE II since i was around 7 years old and I have to admit the game is still very fresh and enjoyable. Though it is a great game I feel there is a necessary requirement to enjoying this game. Siblings, family or friends! I have been playing this game with my brothers for many years and it is so much fun backstabbing each other, working together and interacting with each other in a video game. I think of it like a board game, it is most enjoyable to play it with people you know instead of robots or random people because it is a way to bond. There are some solo options but the AI are very predictable, the only other option is ES Online which is hard to use since the game is so dated and few people around the world play making for a lot of lag.

There are few RTS franchises that can boast about having as much success as AoE has had, and there is good reason behind that.  After putting in nearly 100 hours into the game I can easily say, this one does not disappoint for the most part.  It's no AoE II, but it's close.  That puts this game head and shoulders above most other strategy games.  Ensemble Studios really did an incredible job on their final entry into this series, and they will be greatly missed.\n\nGameplay : The gameplay of this entry in the AoE series is very similar to the previous two.  Build a base/town, build an economy, raise an army, destroy your enemies.  While it might be a simple straightforward process, it's a hell of a lot of fun.  The combat is visceral, the interface is simplistic enough for even brand new strategy game players to get a grasp on it in just a few short minutes, and the payoff is worth it, for the most part.  The only part that seems to have gotten worse in this entry, is the unit path-finding.  I don't know why or how this particular area got worse, but it definitely did.  Units will seemingly go completely out of there way to get to where you want them to go.  And villagers will CONSTANTLY lose track of what they are supposed to be doing.  The Idle Villager button was nice in AoE II, but it wasn't a necessity.  But in AoE III, you will be clicking it every minute.\n\nThere are several modes of gameplay in this version including but not limited to: Campaign, Single-player Random Maps, Multiplayer Standard, etc.  But all of them hold the same general process of base building and conquering your enemies.  The campaigns are lengthy, but slightly repetitive and the characters are not really that engaging, even in the expansions.  The real gem is the multiplayer.  There are several different civilizations to choose from, each one with incredibly unique units that have completely different capabilities.  So while the units are different, this forces different strategies depending on the civilization you have chosen. This creates a unique experience and feel to each civilization and keeps the gameplay fresh while extending it's longevity.\n\nOf course when it comes to multiplayer strategy games, balancing is key.  ESO did a pretty good job of balancing units and civs to begin with, but there were a few missteps in the original that were fixed in the expansions.  So of course the final expansion, The Asian Dynasties, is the definitive AoE III multiplayer experience.  (I don't think you can even play the Warchiefs multiplayer anymore)  I do not wish to go much further in depth with gameplay simply because this is a strategy game and can literally be talked and discussed about forever.  So I'll just finish with this:  The gameplay is really incredible and enjoyable, while also being long-lasting.\n\nGraphics : This game was released in 2005.  2005.  I'll say that one more time.  This game was released in 2005.  And it STILL looks better than a ton of games being released these days.  The new physics engine that was put into place for AoE III is incredible and might be the best looking one in strategy games.  Buildings fall apart completely differently depending on what they are being attacked by and how.  Fire two cannons at two different houses, and they will be blown apart in completely different ways, even from the same angles.  This game was WAY ahead of it's time in terms of graphics.  You will often find yourself just sitting and staring in wonderment at the action that is taking place on the screen (when really you should probably be taking care of other things in the game).\n\nSound : The audio is perfectly matched for this game.  All the way from the muskets firing, to armies being demolished by elephants, and to cannons thundering over everything else.  And you will hear those cannons from very far away.  Just this small addition, brings in a massive level of tension to the game (especially when playing with Fog of War on).  You can hear the artillery slowly encroaching on your base, and depending on your level of readiness, you are either swarming around trying to prepare or silently waiting for the first shot to be fired in a battle that will determine the fate of your town.\n\nAs for the music, it's OK.  I'm a big fan of the soundtracks in the AoE series as they have always meshed ever so perfectly with the gameplay and visuals.  This entry probably has the weakest soundtrack of all three games.  But it's not terrible.  Just OK.\n\nLasting Appeal : This game has tremendous lasting appeal.  And ESO specifically built it that way.  By implementing the new Home City system into this entry, your City can earn experience and level up after almost every match, which unlocks new cards that you can put into your City's deck that provide bonuses that can be called upon during the match.  Anything from a passive bonus to resource gathering rates, to massive extra reinforcement troops.  The servers are still packed with players ready to fight and try to demolish you so don't be afraid of dwindling player base.\n\nFinal Verdict : This game is definitely an 8/10.  Superb gameplay, fantastic graphics, awesome audio, and great lasting appeal.  Is it worth $40?  Probably not.  That's a lot of asking money for a game that came out in 2005.  I think $30 is much more reasonable.","September 21, 2014","true","98.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Age of Empires 3 has always held a special place in my heart. I've played since the first AOE so just liking what I have is not a thing here. I genuinly see this as an improvement and large innovation in the series. The pace is nice, and the fact that resources gather so long as your settler are gathering is a nice change that speeds up the game. the addition of deck and shipments is also very fun allowing multple builds for nations and different ways to play your nation no matter what you play. The base nations alone are also well made. some balancing is an issue as it is with most unsupported games but each nation feels different and has a new way to play and thrive. IE Russian= numbers over strength, France= cavalry and defense. There's quite a few ways to play your nation so don't be too focused on the "meta". Trade routes and native alliances make a nice change as well, most native upgrades are helpful and give you a reason to explore the map and find native settlements. Frankly the game I see here is great and I wish the community was larger rather than focusing on the past of AOE 2. The changes are well done and keep the game fresh.\nIf you're a fan of RTS's I would highly recomend playing this game. especially is you found AOE 2 to be a bit slow and lacking.","March 26","true","217.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The game takes place mostly around the frontier days, with the exception of the Asian Dynasty pack.  I'll be talking a lot about that expansion because it's vastly different from the rest of the game.  Voice acting is decent, as are the stories, predictable though they are.  The music is catchy but highly repetitive.\n\n85% of the game has no chill.  While it's not really all that challenging on Normal difficulty, most of the missions in the game have some kind of time or mechanical constraint that prevent them from being standard "build then destroy" affairs.  Normally I wouldn't complain about this, but themes are re-used so much that they quickly grow old.  "Oh, I don't start off with a base again."  "Oh, I can't get any villagers again."  "Oh, I don't get any resources so I have to use trading posts again."  So on and so forth.\n\nThe UI is kind of bad.  It eats up a third of my screen on 1080p, and hotkeys (of which there are many) aren't discernible via mouseovers of the buttons, so you wind up having to go back into the Options menu repeatedly if you want to use them.  Attack-move seemed not to work properly for me, which was very noticeable but not a dealbreaker.\n\nAsian Dynasties involved very different mechanics.  Minus the UI, the production value, and a couple of buildings/progressions, it was almost different enough to be another RTS.  Some of the alterations were neat, others were bizarre.  If you play the Chinese faction during Skirmish mode, they can't build any common soldiers until they Age Up (upgrade the town hall), only siege units.  I'm sorry, what?  Whose brilliant idea was that?\n\nYou see, although there are many factions, there are really only four styles in the game:  European, Japanese, Chinese, and Indian.  It's not merely a difference in units, or buildings, but the fundamental mechanics of how they work.  Because I didn't spend a lot of hours in Skirmish mode, it's impossible for me to say if the game is balanced, but I doubt it.\n\nSomething that appealed to me were the farming/shipment mechanics.  There's food, wood, coin, and a separate export resource if you're playing Asian Dynasties.  The way it's handled, however, you can build farms or receive shipments that are slow, infinite pools of any of those things.  If you run out of wild animals to hunt, build a farm or raise livestock.  If you run out of gold, plantations or rice paddies are infinite.   Wood is more difficult, but Asian Dynasties allows you to plant groves, or you can receive shipments in any case.  As a result, resource-management in the game is a lot less stressful than pretty much any RTS I've played.\n\nAnother thing that stood out is the ability to train stacks of five.  If you have the resources, you can train five troops in one building at once, and when it's finished five will pop out.  The need for multiple barracks is basically absent.\n\nThat's about everything that stood out for me.  I wouldn't pay 40 dollars for the game, wait for a decent sale, but it's definitely worth picking up for RTS fans if you don't mind historical backdrop.","March 1","true","37.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

So to this date this is the last AoE games made. It has lots of new stuff and is very inovative from the first two...and yet...a bit boring compared to them. For some reason the developers simplified building stuff and gathering resources then they added home cards and reinforcements. At first it looked cool. But as you play it somehow distracts you, from the game, from the upgrades selectable in the buildings. It lost the AoE charm. By no means is this a bad game! But it falls short even with the great War Chiefs and Asian Dynasties expansion packs.

There are few RTS franchises that can boast about having as much success as AoE has had, and there is good reason behind that.  After putting in nearly 100 hours into the game I can easily say, this one does not disappoint for the most part.  It's no AoE II, but it's close.  That puts this game head and shoulders above most other strategy games.  Ensemble Studios really did an incredible job on their final entry into this series, and they will be greatly missed.\n\nGameplay : The gameplay of this entry in the AoE series is very similar to the previous two.  Build a base/town, build an economy, raise an army, destroy your enemies.  While it might be a simple straightforward process, it's a hell of a lot of fun.  The combat is visceral, the interface is simplistic enough for even brand new strategy game players to get a grasp on it in just a few short minutes, and the payoff is worth it, for the most part.  The only part that seems to have gotten worse in this entry, is the unit path-finding.  I don't know why or how this particular area got worse, but it definitely did.  Units will seemingly go completely out of there way to get to where you want them to go.  And villagers will CONSTANTLY lose track of what they are supposed to be doing.  The Idle Villager button was nice in AoE II, but it wasn't a necessity.  But in AoE III, you will be clicking it every minute.\n\nThere are several modes of gameplay in this version including but not limited to: Campaign, Single-player Random Maps, Multiplayer Standard, etc.  But all of them hold the same general process of base building and conquering your enemies.  The campaigns are lengthy, but slightly repetitive and the characters are not really that engaging, even in the expansions.  The real gem is the multiplayer.  There are several different civilizations to choose from, each one with incredibly unique units that have completely different capabilities.  So while the units are different, this forces different strategies depending on the civilization you have chosen. This creates a unique experience and feel to each civilization and keeps the gameplay fresh while extending it's longevity.\n\nOf course when it comes to multiplayer strategy games, balancing is key.  ESO did a pretty good job of balancing units and civs to begin with, but there were a few missteps in the original that were fixed in the expansions.  So of course the final expansion, The Asian Dynasties, is the definitive AoE III multiplayer experience.  (I don't think you can even play the Warchiefs multiplayer anymore)  I do not wish to go much further in depth with gameplay simply because this is a strategy game and can literally be talked and discussed about forever.  So I'll just finish with this:  The gameplay is really incredible and enjoyable, while also being long-lasting.\n\nGraphics : This game was released in 2005.  2005.  I'll say that one more time.  This game was released in 2005.  And it STILL looks better than a ton of games being released these days.  The new physics engine that was put into place for AoE III is incredible and might be the best looking one in strategy games.  Buildings fall apart completely differently depending on what they are being attacked by and how.  Fire two cannons at two different houses, and they will be blown apart in completely different ways, even from the same angles.  This game was WAY ahead of it's time in terms of graphics.  You will often find yourself just sitting and staring in wonderment at the action that is taking place on the screen (when really you should probably be taking care of other things in the game).\n\nSound : The audio is perfectly matched for this game.  All the way from the muskets firing, to armies being demolished by elephants, and to cannons thundering over everything else.  And you will hear those cannons from very far away.  Just this small addition, brings in a massive level of tension to the game (especially when playing with Fog of War on).  You can hear the artillery slowly encroaching on your base, and depending on your level of readiness, you are either swarming around trying to prepare or silently waiting for the first shot to be fired in a battle that will determine the fate of your town.\n\nAs for the music, it's OK.  I'm a big fan of the soundtracks in the AoE series as they have always meshed ever so perfectly with the gameplay and visuals.  This entry probably has the weakest soundtrack of all three games.  But it's not terrible.  Just OK.\n\nLasting Appeal : This game has tremendous lasting appeal.  And ESO specifically built it that way.  By implementing the new Home City system into this entry, your City can earn experience and level up after almost every match, which unlocks new cards that you can put into your City's deck that provide bonuses that can be called upon during the match.  Anything from a passive bonus to resource gathering rates, to massive extra reinforcement troops.  The servers are still packed with players ready to fight and try to demolish you so don't be afraid of dwindling player base.\n\nFinal Verdict : This game is definitely an 8/10.  Superb gameplay, fantastic graphics, awesome audio, and great lasting appeal.  Is it worth $40?  Probably not.  That's a lot of asking money for a game that came out in 2005.  I think $30 is much more reasonable.","September 21, 2014","true","98.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, I don't know where this review will be going as I am typing spontanously.\n\nFirst off, this game does play differently. Alot, actually. From what I have seen, the gameplay from Age of Empires 2, especially online, solely consists of spewing out as many villagers as possible in a short time, hamster all the resources to build yourself up quickly and just make a ♥♥♥♥♥on of units, preferably cannoniers and siege cannons.\nHowever, in Age of Empires 3 this is simply not possible, as the population cap is already at 200; considering that unit types [e.g. Musketeers as light infantry, Helbardiers as Heavy Infantry, Light Cavalry, Ranged Cavalry, etc.] it is mandatory to have a balance in your army, as the quantity is limited. In this game it is necessary to think about the numbers of Helbardiers to defend your ranged units against enemy melee soldiers, the numbers of Skirmisher to strike down enemy infantry, the number of cavalry to attack the enemy's ranged units, additionally the number of cannons who are deadly agaist masses, and so on, and so on.\n\nPersonally, having to think about such things instead of spamming units seems way more fun.\nSame thing is to be said about the buildings.\nUnlike Age of Empires 2, in this game most buildings can be build limited times only; you cannot build a wall of towers anymore to defend yourself, you can only build 11. You cannot build a Fort (basically AoE3's version of a Castle) in front of the enemy's town because for one, you cannot build things too close to the enemy's town centre, and for two, most civilizations can only have one or two forts in the entire game which can only be built by special wagons, making the risk of losing a fort far more tragic.\nThese special wagons can only be sent by home shipment cards, along with other things that make your resource gather rate higher, send you a certain number of units, resource crates, and wagons which build towers/forts/town centres for free.\nThis seemed to be a thing that could have confused fans of Age of Empires 2 at first (the only reference I have about this is my cousin who didn't like this specific mechanic, don't bash me), I mysel thought the game to be too complicated, although this turnt out to be entirely false as the home shipment system is far more simple than expected.\n\nMost civilizations in Age of Empires 3 differ alot from each other; Chinese can only build "armies" which are essentially packs of 2 different soldier-types; Ottomans produce villagers automatically and for free, however this takes longer and the production process has to be sped up with upgrades; they lack melee infantry and instead of having a musketeer unit, they use a more expensive and stronger Janissary unit. I could go into more detaill into the different civilizations like the Aztecs which only have Infantry, but it is best to discover all these things for oneself or just googling it, as this review would take too long.\n\nYe.\nI love it.","February 26","true","233.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I would recommend buying both expansions though if you have to choose, get the War Chiefs as it adds a certain 'something' that I don't think Asian Dynasties got quite right.\n\nI'm still hoping that one day, just one day, there will be an AOE IV and maybe even V and VI, maybe set in WW1, WW2 and Cold War era?","April 8","true","41.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Like many people i'd bought it years ago, only to find my playing days cut short thanks to it being incompatible with Windows Vista onwards. Not any more! I can confirm the Steam version works perfectly on my Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit system.\n\nFans of the first two games will immediately be able to dive straight in, although there have been some major changes in the third installment compared to the first two. Firstly there's not so much emphasis on micro management now. Instead you get to concentrate on the exploration and battle elements, which makes this game the most enjoyable of the three. Secondly there is the new home city section which allows you to ship units and supplies to the new world during the game. Between games you can customise your home city to change which units and supplies can be sent out to you, along with the appearance of the city itself.\n\nVisually this game absolutely trounces the two previous games, and indeed almost any other game in the genre, it is graphically amazing. Sound-wise it's not much different to the first two, with the sound being good but not excellent, and not too intrusive. The campaign isn't too difficult, so the greater challenge will come from skirmish games (rather like Age of Mythology... indeed all previous comparisons to the first two Age of Empires games also apply to Age of Mythology).\n\nIf you did not have this game before, you really owe it to yourself to buy it now that the compatibility problems have been sorted out and it works fine on Windows 8, 7 and presumably Vista as well. If, like me, you already had this game but could not play it because of those compatibility problems, well i can now confirm that those problems have been solved! This game deserves to be in everyone's collection.","November 25, 2013","true","16.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There are so many variables determining a win or loss in this game that it astonishing how many different ways one person can play the same civ to get an advantage over their opponent.  I am a returning player who used to spend my weekends playing the game and am very happy to see the gaming community returning.  6 months ago I put the game down to handle matters in my life and returned to see the community double over my absense.  On peak hours i was accustomed to seeing 1800 players online.  Currently I am seeing numbers over 3000.  I hope the community grows even further and if the rights are ever obtained again from microst perhaps a sequel as well with the same mechanics.  Thank you for reading  and see you in game.","January 2","true","737.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The attention to detail is astounding, from everything to cracks in a townhouse just about ready to crumble, to the wide range of sound effects ranging from hilarously stereotypical comments from Isabella of Spain to Frederick the Great of Germany, to the sounds of canons such as the Falconets. Even the different environments manage to evoke a sense of belonging, as if one is truly standing in the snow in Siberia, or sweating bullets in Caribbean - not an easy feat for a strategy game to achieve. The fact that no major installment have been released since (Age of Empires IV anyone?) is simply a testament to the replay value and endurance of one of the all-time greatest strategy games released.\n\nVERDICT: 10/10","May 26","true","79.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
