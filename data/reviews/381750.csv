RCSIM2 offers cars, boats and quadcopters for use on default tracks as well as user-made tracks. As this is an RC simulator it is of course geared towards people who have at least some interest in RC vehicles, if you don’t fit that profile, this game and therefore this review, probably won’t be for you. It’s worth mentioning while I do enjoy RC sims and I do have an interest in the vehicles themselves I’m not hugely knowledgeable about them.\n\nPresentation\nRCSIM2 may not have ground-breaking graphics but what it does have are good enough to enjoy the game. The vehicle models are all high quality which of course is the most important part of the game’s presentation as an RC sim. One thing about the game’s presentation that I particularly liked was that, as there is an onboard camera for the vehicles, some of the vehicles have lower quality cameras compared to the third person view, such as on the smallest quadcopter in the game, just added a nice touch of realism for me.\n\nGameplay\nRCSIM2 can be enjoyed in four ways, five if you count the map editor.\n\nFirst up, we have Practice mode. This is pretty self-explanatory, you choose a vehicle and then select a map you wish to test out. The only limitation here is that boats cannot be used on maps without water which is pretty obvious. Once you’re actually in the game you’re free to explore the map as you wish, the checkpoints and lap markers do work so you can actually complete proper laps and check your time for them if you wish to improve your times for time trials or multiplayer.\n\nNext we have the Time Trial mode. Once you’ve selected your vehicle and track you’ll be given a short warm-up time to get a feel for the track (this can be skipped if you’d rather get straight to the action). You’ll then be given a set amount of time, three minutes, to complete as many laps as you can as fast as you can. Obviously the amount of laps doesn’t matter, it’s your time which is important, but your fastest lap will be used so don’t just sit there and do nothing after your first lap!\n\nMultiplayer is the next mode on our list. Multiplayer basically allows you to do whatever you want. You can race against your friends in any RC vehicle or you could have a quadcopter paintball dogfight against your friends! I know which one I’d choose.\n\nThe final proper game mode is the Challenge mode. From what I’ve seen of it the aim of this mode is to shoot a certain amount of balloons using a paintball gun. This mode requires a vehicle with a paintball gun as well as a map that has balloons floating around.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, RCSIM2 also has a track editor (it will eventually have a vehicle editor too). Now I’m not particularly good at using an editor in any game but I did check out RCSIM2’s, I must say it looks incredibly good. You’re given all the tools you need to build whatever track you want. You can change how big the map itself is, you can choose what terrain you want to use and then of course you have access to spawn points and all of the objects in the game. Once you’ve created your track it can be uploaded to the Steam workshop for other people to use. The idea is to create your own tracks and share them (though the game does come with some tracks made by the dev) and so this is obviously a very important part of the game.\n\nThere are of course other things I need to mention regarding the gameplay but I’ll keep it short and snappy. RCSIM2 has a full day and night cycle and you’re able to choose whatever time of day you want, though there’s currently no weather in the game. There are eight different camera angles for you to use including a first person camera that allows you to move yourself around, it’s worth mentioning the controls for the gamepad don’t work properly for the first person view and controlling your RC is pretty much impossible in this camera view, it’s mainly just to position yourself. The marshals in the game have ragdoll physics, it’s pretty silly but it can be rather fun to just run them over with your RC or shoot them with a paintball gun every so often in practice mode.\n\nMiscellaneous The RC physics seem realistic to me.\nThe sound effects are reasonably good but from what I’ve read on the forums and other reviews from people who have a better knowledge of RC vehicles they could use some improvement.\nMost of the settings aren’t implemented yet, for now you just get a generic quality level for graphics and input options.\nIn regards to input options, you can use KB&M (not recommended), an Xbox 360 controller (or any other kind of controller that works with windows) and of course, since this is an RC sim, you can use proper RC controllers if they have a USB connector.\nThere’s not a huge amount of content at the time I’ve written this review but as it progresses through development and more people start making and uploading their own tracks the amount of content will increase.\nVerdict\nWorth Purchasing.\n\nRCSIM2 is a solid RC simulator that any fans of the genre should try. It’s reasonably realistic, the RCs themselves look good and it will only get better as it develops. As I said earlier, this game probably isn’t for your average gamer but if you like RCs then you should pick it up or at least follow its development.\n\nReview Copy Provided.\n\nNo drama, Just Reviews.\n\nEl K.","November 26, 2015","true","5.4"," 56 of 65 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","56","65","3","4"

(In the first hour I've tried some multiplayer (without opening ports) and even with Europe>USA seemed quite good)\n- Generally fun for all ages, especially when running over Larry :)\n- Eventhough the content is few, already great variety in content.\n- Sandbox/Track-Editor this is an option that stands out, it's already working great and this also has great potential.\n- Great controller support, any game like this should have it this way.\n\nNeutrals / Tips:- Audio/Sounds, the voices are already quite well, but I do think the vehicular sounds are up for improvement.\n- More information in-game with the Track Editor. (It took me a while to figure out the track needs all 5 checkpoints, for a lap to be a lap).\n- For the Track-Editor to have an option to make long "strokes" of the same terrain paint to make straight lines.\n\nCons:- Staying really objective I can't see any cons.","November 25, 2015","true","8.5"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","22","27","2","4"

As a simulator it is doing its job to simulate the Rc world. I have messed around with the track editor and it is a strong feature of the game and was a smart idea to put that in during the period of early access when actual content is low currently.\nNow for the dreded complaints, but wait lets first talk about what my complaints are. My only things that I think needed improvement on in the game are things that are fine to have when your game is in early access. The main one being a lack of overall game options for configuring the game to work best, and thats fine the creator is working on them so its not that big of a deal. So with that being explained that I won't go into detail about my complaints because they don't matter at this point of a new early access game.\n\nSomething I would love to see implamented is some kind of a driving tutorial. just one level to help those new Rc drivers who this is their first time playing around with a realistic Rc driving mechanics (like the sharp turning and the quick accel). That and I think it would be cool if there could be a car editor tool (not configuring the mechanics) but like creating bodies so  you could have that personalized look. That could be cool but I don't think that needs to be a priority since I would rather see more polish and configurations of the base game.\n\nI give this game a 7/10 only because this game is early access and needs to be worked on (something that is happening so I feel that when I review this again later on that 7 will become a 9)","January 31","true","3.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","10","10","0","0"

This RC Sim is packing a lot of potential, and I can't wait for what's too come.\n\nFor starters there's a lot of unique and new ways to be immersed into the experience. From seeing bugs flying around lights at night in a realistic way, to the day and night cycling, and the fact there's rag doll models for the other randomly placed people. I think that those small yet inventive aspects could really show the other more expensive RC sims how to be fun and entertaining without the need of extensive experience in RC vehicle handling. I really can't wait for what's coming up in the next set of updates, but I'm sure  "Devotid" will live up to their name and really provide something special for RC sim players and just gamers alike.\n\nThank you for giving me my dream hobby back Devotid, and may all the future updates and added content gleam in your efforts.","March 2","true","29.0"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

Its EA and with that has the need for tweaking and bugs to fix. The Dev seems to be very interested in forward progress and has alot of plans to continue progress. RC cars to boats to quad copters there is a lot to choose from. Making your own track or place to fly is really cool. It is worth picking up now and for those that wait keep a close eye out for the updates.  I think this game will take off.","November 26, 2015","true","62.7"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

Despsite the game in an alpha, you can build detailed and complex tracks with easy intuitive tools. In a few hours you can build tracks that looks like they were made like pro developers.\n\nHard to believe ? I show the receipts on my Steam workshop, where you can download my custom made tracks. Have a look !\n\nBuggies, varied cars, drift cars, drones and boat, the game offers lots of vehicle choices. I know RC 2.0's devs is currently working on vehicle setup. I'm looking forward to this. The multiplayer has to be improved and probably will in the coming months. You can already race against people online but only with people from your country yet. The time trial is working tho and you can try to beat your best laps on the official tracks and self-made community tracks.\n\nSome of the thing that i'd like to see ingame:\n\n- Being able to set more track check-points in the editor (currently 5 + the finish line). This is not enough to create legit multiplayer races.\n\n- With the global multiplayer, a global leaderboard with the lap times. (best of all time, best of the week, of the day, etc)\n\n- Water for Larry, he deserves it.","December 31, 2015","true","126.4"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","12","15","2","0"

I played a lot of RealRace duratraxs rc simulator/game and even the second one, I'm not new to rc simulators. I've played great planes air rc simulator and again this is apples to oranges at this stage.\n\nI grabbed my vrc dongle so i could use my radio as the controller, the game already has support for this which I thought was pretty rad. It plays really well with the controller but again this doesn't feel anything like vrc.\n\nI keep comparing vrc to this why? It's called RC Simulation 2.0, it's still very early access and I'm very impressed with what they have so far. The user made tracks, the variety of vehicles, car setups and challenges. It's a very good RC game at the moment, I can't wait to see what this game turns into and will update this review as time goes on. I would defiantly recommend this to a friend.","February 6","true","3.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Needs more tilt and glide.\n\nThe future looks great when it comes to customization, short loading times and a lot of functions.\nAnd the best part - CRAWLERS!\nI hope we'll be able to change tires and adjust suspension later on :)\n\nTracks; I do believe the tracks are too small and cluttered.

I would say that it lacks a social community for multiplayer but what can you expect from a brand new game on the indy market in early access with little advertisment?\nTell your friends about this game and laugh as they freak out over the small stuff along with us.

(theres a lot of settings to fine tune) then you just get lost in the laps with your touring car. the dirt tracks are great for jumps, that you can level out with throttle control, with the SCTs, buggys, and trophy truck. its all, so far, a very quick menu interface and very easy to switch cars, tracks, and to different challenge modes. ...havent had time to create my own map. looks pretty detailed, i'll pass for now.\ncant wait to see custom bodys, or any real parts as settings modifiers; real tires (branded), instead of the tire front/slide grip settings....\nit is indeed an RC Simulation. i'm happy. can't imagine how the final realease will make me feel.","April 10","true","16.0"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

It was developed by veteran RC Racer of 25+ years and an indie game developer devotid. Designed to give users the thrill of today's High Tech Radio Controlled Cars, Boats and Quad Copters on any of the user created track/maps/venues. Fly some quadcopters armed with paintball guns or go on a RC Rubicon with your Rock Crawler. The possibilities are endless with RC Simulation 2.0!\n\nPros:\nUnlimited possibilities\n\nVery enjoyable: can provide hours of gameplay just screwing around, maybe testing your creations, or trying out what others have made.\n\nSemi-realistic (in a broad sence)\n\nThe awesomeness of controlling RC vehicles without having to go outside and do it!\n\nAny controller will work: even a real RC controller can be used with the right USB-PC adaptor\n\nMany different view modes for controlling your vehicle\n\nNeutral:\nA few glitches (expected of an early access game) The glitches I have found have given me a good laugh :)\n\nCons:\nNot much bad to be said about this game: but it is unfinished, hence early access.\n\nFinal thoughtsSuper fun early access sandbox RC simulation game that will have you playing for hours!

RC Simulation 2.0 potentially offers so much more. It's early access so I'm not moaning, I'm hoping the sim' continues to develop.\nThe cars are much more fun and I've been having a blast with the short course trucks on some of the tracks.\nFor those wanting a sim to practice flying, RC Simulation 2.0 isn't what I'd recommend at this time.\n\n\n\n\n","March 11","false","1.8"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I really wanted to like this game-- I tried to find something good in it, but I just can't. Everything is wrong here.\n\nWhy?\n\nOne: The gameplay is confusing as hell. I wasted about 3 minutes trying to figure out why my car couldn't move and that was because I didn't realize that I needed to move my character (who controls horrible, has terrible camera views) to the car.\n\nTwo: Barely any content for a $15 game. You get 8 cars with 6 different tracks. And it's as if they're trying to force you to use mods to make the game more fun-- but the whole point of gaming is that it has to be fun WITHOUT mods. I don't want to modify game files just so I can have more fun with it.\n\nThree: Ugly graphics and performance. The graphics makes the game look far more older than it is. It looks like this game was made in 2005! Can I just mention how bad the performance is? My own computer is having trouble staying above 30 fps, even at moderate settings. No game should have performance as bad as this, especially when the graphics look like something that came from a ♥♥♥♥ing Xbox game!\n\nFour: CAR CONTROLS ARE TERRIBLE! If you're using a gamepad, one notch to the left can completely throw your car off-course, driving into a wall, or accidentally killing yourself or somebody else standing brainlessly on the track. Oh yeah, sometimes my car got stuck on a piece of the track, like a barrier, and I was unable to get out; but the developers for some reason didn't design a way for the player to fix the car if this happened. Even the braindead track marshals can't do anything, and just sit and watch a poor RC car laying upside down in the middle of the track! Can I just mention how sensitive each car is in the game? You'd be going 0 to 60 in no time flat!\n\nFive: Dead multiplayer. Nobody is online, simple as that.\n\nOverall: I can't recommend this game, even for free, because this game is bad and it takes up space. Please ignore this game no matter how good it may look from the previews. I know this game is Early Access, but I have to review what the game is currently, not what it will be in the future. Who knows; my review might change if they actually fix the things mentioned above.","April 2","false","0.6"," 3 of 10 people (30%) found this review helpful","30","3","10","0","1"

Try to reset the plane...reset, reset, reset, each time it re-spawns against the fence and breaks.\nGive up and try the crawler...it can't crawl, it has to be going fast to even get up a hill, and you can't get between the markers which is just a narrow path, it gets no traction at all.\nGive up, try taking the 1/8 buggy to the track, what track ? ....it's just a total mess of random odd shaped hills with no real visible path to follow, the tracks that are decent and marked are way to small, the scale of the track compared to the cars is way off, and when you get stuck some idiot picks your car up and sets it right back down on the tube so you're still stuck and have to have him reset your car a second time, maybe a third time. Then there is the sound of the cars...seriously, what broken piece of electronic equipment were they recorded from, they phusics are terrible, and if you just look at the car wrong a wheel will fall off.\nI used to race Team Losi trucks in real life and i am also an RC pilot, crashing a $1200 nitro JR heli is more fun than this simulator.\n\n0.3 hours and i already hate this game, and sadly it was a birthday gift to me.\nNo, i do not recommend this game to anyone.","March 2","false","0.6"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"
