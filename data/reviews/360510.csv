It is a 3D Faster Than Light + a few more games mixed in it (most notably Star Trek Bridge Commander) + Ironman experience.  It is there to test the fans of the rogue-like hardcore genre who do not complain about losing stuff or people, getting destroyed, then learning and adapting as a result. There is no save and load function. You roll the roulette and you live with what you've gotten in a beautiful 3d FTL-Star Trek format.\n\nFOREWORD:\nIf someone says that the game has no replay value, they have played it way too little. Look at my play time. I rarely did the same run twice, unless trying to beat my previous score or testing new stuff.\n\nThe game is out of early access as of today, the 04.03.2015. Sadly, it already received a number of negative reviews during the years of development, so you will be looking at mixed reviews for a while. Most of it was because the devs were trying to find the reasons for the game not launching for a number of people, and those were readily cranking out the negative reviews. FYI, before I start with the good and the bad.\n\nAs usual, I will start with the good and the bad.\n\nThe absolute BEST:\n\nThe game generates meaningful stories through its gameplay, the type that make you take to the forums and share, be it for a win or a loss. How you had a great playthrough until everything started falling apart, people started dying, enemies were swarming you in throves and eventually destroyed you. Or how everything was so bleak, you were out of resources but managed to find a solitary planet where you safely did 6+ probe runs, restocked like crazy and won the game? Or how you went all out berserk and punched your way through the enemy lines like a boss? Or how a single rash decision on an away mission lost you two of your most valuable crew members and it all went downhill OR you still won nevertheless? Yep, all of this is possible. I absolutely love this about a game.\n\nThe Good:\n1. Beautiful backdrops - the space, the planets and the suns look beautiful. The space must be black by default, but you are playing a game right?\n2. The ship is also a looker. I personally love the way it appears on my screen with all of its flashing blue red and metal stuff. Once you start building structures, they will also appear inside it, which adds a new level of immersion.\n3. Resource Management - picking what you want, what you need, when you need it might be the difference between defeat and a victory. Shortages really punish you, and even if you win, it affects your score big time.\n4. You get to pick your ship parts - this allows for huge customization. You may pick a nimble ship with fewer systems but tons of cargo space, or you can make yourself a juggernaut. with less storage space and better weapons, absorption, shuttle missions, etc. All up to you.\n5. Last ditch effort - this type of play really reels you in as you see the last 10 000 people of the human race die from lack of food, oxygen, killed by enemies and random events. Speaking about random events...\n6. Random events are either detrimental (e.g. Alien Flu) or beneficial (Training for crewmembers). This forces you to deal with situations even more strategically, because while fighting, people still die.\n7. Ironman - no going back. I love this type of play for certain games and this one is certainly worth it, just like FTL.\n8. You have a decent grid size and you need to pick your way through it till you reach the end goal, dealing with hostile encounters, resource shortages, planet and object exploration, etc.\n9. The combat - in FTL the combat was minimalistic. Shoot something and it will either hit or miss. Here, you need to think on your feet, use different coloured weapons and shield harmonics, defend and fire when necessary, evade shots, pause, think, and do your best. If you wish you can opt to play completely without pausing - that makes the combat extremely dynamic, but you will most likely suffer way more hits.\n10. Strategy wins the game - trust me, I felt that. Making rash decisions isn't the best thing. You really need to accept the position you are in and adapt to it. Playing to the strengths of your ship and crew is key.\n11. Renaming crewmembers - are you a Star Trek, Star Wars, Farscape or another franchise's fan? Or you like to use the names of your closest friends or family members? You can!\n12. Like FTL, there are multiple ways to victory - at present, I would split them into sneaky, semi-sneaky, bold and reckless types of wins.\n13. The game lets you do stuff on the fly. You just need to learn the mechanics. I am not going to spoil those for you.\n14. Runs vary. A faster engine will get you to the end goal quicker, but a battle-hardened combat crew getting you trough 1 vs 3 encounters is a joy to behold.\n15. Flying through gorgeous space. If you dont like it, it is simply not your jam.\n16. Play-throughs take about 2 hours, which I find good for these types of games.\n17. Scoring system that allows you to check how well you did in comparison to the others.\n18. Many new features added since EA - 3 difficulty settings, ship setups, civilian management, more away missions, etc.\n19. Replayability has been improved a lot since alpha, so you will be looking at a lot of different runs. While the end goal is the same, just like FTL, nobody forces you to reach it - a full exploration run (mine was the first full exploration run to date) takes about 8 hours.\n\nOk. Here's THE BAD.\n\nThe ABSOLUTE WORST:\n\nYou will ragequit if you hate games that punish you. Many a time. Get used to it, or don't buy the game.\n\nTo continue...\n\n1. Steep learning curve - you need to play with ship setups for a while, learn how they work, what resources to pick at start, how long to stay at a planet, which awaymissions are easier and which ones harder, and so on.\n2. NO multiplayer, like FTL. Can't be fixed.\n3. Some bugs are still present, but the devs are all over the community forum, listening to the people and taking notes. Always good to see.\n4. Combat - while I praised it, one can still find it minimalistic.\n5. Punishing away missions since alpha. While the death to success ratio has been curbed a bit, and more choices given to the player, one should still exercise extreme caution when taking on away missions..\n6. Some players still can't launch the game. Best check the forums before buying this game. The devs are hard at work at it.\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nThe game is quite the looker, and has this FTL last ditch type of feeling. Up until now, the devs have been on the money with the updates, consistently adding more content - with the last patch enabling us to manage the civilian population by adding more buildings, with the option to upgrade them in the future to avoid the constant civilian problems. Whoever says this game is short... is right, but it can also be played is a plethora of ways, adding replayability. Fastest way to goal, explore the whole quadrant, go left side, go right side, be sneaky, fight a lot, try not to fight at all. Or plain handicap yourself if U R A PRO. Just try it! I know I did, with runs with as low as 575 credits. To me, this game is one huge sandbox - I get to pick my difficulty (and by that I don't mean the pre-set ones), my setup, my way to play the game and try to win. It is fun - whether you should choose to challenge yourself or just explore the vast quardant of space and enjoy the extremely atmospheric Into the Stars.","July 12, 2015","true","57.4"," 130 of 145 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","130","145","3","12"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/recommended/360510/","thatfuzzytiger","Hobbes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfuzzytiger/","3197 products in account","So close to Battlestar Galactica, and yet so far. Oh devs, one day you will listen to the Tiger, damn you...\nSo. Into The Stars, basically, Battlestar Galactica, you are humanities last hope. A colony ship which moves at best at the speed of a flying space turtle on tranquilisers, moving across a fairly hostile chunk of galaxy in the hope of making it to a habitable planet (Titus Nova). The ship's warp core is more or less dead, you're running on limited resources, everything is going to break slowly, and you're fighting progressively worse situations as you go. It's a bit like a lot of games that involve such mechanics (think FTL and its' ilk).\n\nNow, disclaimer, I kickstarted this game, and I wanted to get involved early because I saw the potential in this to be the big BSG experience that everyone was aiming for. It had the team behind it, it had (and has) the graphics behind it, it has the -music- damn it. What it needed was people who could be dedicated playtesters who could shape the game into something great. People with a lot of experience in the gaming arena who know what works and what doesn't. People who understand the limitations of dev time and therefore could have got the ideas in early so they wouldn't have been going down the wrong track on things like combat and so on.\n\nProblem, the dev team was probably the least communicative that I've ever seen during the KS phase post campaign. It was definitely the least involved KS post release I've been. So I decided to stay well back and wait for the early access release, in the vague hope that hey, these guys looked professional, they'd get this right. I was partially correct.\n\nThe problem of developers who cling too tightly to their children.\nInto The Stars should be seen as an exercise in why if you have a bad idea, you should discard it as quick as you can, rather than double down on it in an attempt to patch it up and make it playable. The big bugbear in this case was combat. Combat here uses a colour frequency system to determine if a shot gets past your (or your opponents shields) or not.\n\nThis is not good gameplay, because it offers no reward to the player, if they do stuff right, they're basically getting the damage from the weapon that they're supposed to get in the first place (presuming it even hits), and if they do stuff right defensively, then their shields function as advertised (yes, it's possible to hit "deflect" and it do -nothing- if your frequency is the wrong colour).\n\nRight from the get go I voiced my criticsm about this system, because I could see this being a major issue with the game, it didn't reward the player, and simply punished the player for lapsing in concentration. It was busywork, and busywork without benefit. Instead of seeing this and discarding the colour frequency idea as one that promoted poor design choices, the team instead decided to try to create workarounds such as the "evade" button (which ironically allows you to dodge fire regardless of frequency) and ways of forcing the opponent to flip their frequency to allow you to line up deflections and attacks easier. In effect, sticking to their original idea in the hope they could make it workable. It's STILL bad, when you've multiple foes to fight and you've got this mess of colours going on, it's chaotic, and it's not entertaining, it's annoying.\n\nThe issues didn't stop there.\nThe civillian city, created to give the events that pop up some meaning and context, was another idea that didn't promote good gameplay, largely because it lacked thematic background and narrative to tie it in to the game proper. It was bolted on as a means to add work and to try and force you to care about the civillians, except in this case it didn't make a great deal of sense, why were you building these extra modules, why did they need arbitrary numbers of minerals, why did the city appear to be entirely divorced from the ship itself?\n\nHad the city mimicked the layout of the ARK, and perhaps had you been building additional modules INTO the available cargo space (or indeed, demolishing habitable space to make room for cargo at the cost of civillian homes), THAT would have made more sense narratively, and could have opened up a lot of interesting decisions. As it stands, it feels like a stub that lacks a real sense of place.\n\nThen there's the mess that is the stat layout and where said stats are used, Engineering being too heavily relied upon with Toughness being a dump stat that seems to have little bearing on much of anything. Again, a matter that was raised before the launch of the game, but not addressed at launch (I fired up the game and to my dismay, you still need engineering for the bulk of your operations, half of your combat duties are reliant on Engineering), my proposal was to slim down the stats from six to five and to more evenly distribute the "workload" of the stats to ensure that each role had a more valid use in the game.\n\nAugh.\n\nThere's the soul of a good game in here...\nAnd it pains me to say, that I think the devs know there's a good game in here too, but in this case they went down some decisions early on and decided to stick to them too rigidly, rather than fail fast and recover faster. The launch version is polished, but the design issues STILL plague the game.\n\nHad they listened to the posts I made far earlier (as far back as 0.2 even), and changed course, this might be a very different game, and this might be a very different review. For the better or worse? Who knows. I can't claim to have all the answers, but I know that -these- choices didn't end up making sense, when you added them all together. Perhaps with more iteration and patching, this game will be worthy of recommendation, but for now, I can only very cautiously recommend it to people who have a major BSG itch to scratch.\n\nVerdict : Very cautious one thumb up, for Battlestar Galactica types. Otherwise, wait for a sale, and then take a look.","March 4","true","3.1"," 249 of 324 people (77%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","77","249","324","13","19"

I don't dislike this game. I enjoyed my time with it, I just felt like there wan't enough there.\n\nAs a Star Trek fan, this game immediatly caught my eye because of the whole "being the captain on the bridge" thing. Comparisons to FTL sold it and, in fact, I'm going to compare it to FTL a few times in this review.\n\nThe foundation of the game is solid. You attempt to get from A to B, starting with limited resources and scouring planets to replenish your supplies while evading an alien in race in pursuit of you. You pick a crew at the beginning of the game and level them up as they perform various tasks, such as away missions or dealing with civilian unrest.\n\nThe problem I began to encounter very early on is that the potential of this game isn't fully realized. Let me explain: You're given this fairly large space in which to traverse, yet it feels very empty. You'll encounter the Skorn (the alien race chasing you) fairly often, but the only interactions you ever have with other races out in space, as far as I could tell, is limited to trading resources. Contrast this to FTL, where encounters in space can come with any number of outcomes that could end up fundamentally altering how you handle that run. At the very least, something interesting happens. In Into the Stars, you can encounter some aliens when you reach planets and they reward you with stuff, but I quickly found the rewards pretty boring. For example, one event awarded me with a better life support system. This was USEFUL, but it didn't make anything more interesting. Again, compair this to FTL, where getting ship modules and new weapons can greatly alter the way the game plays. Next, the combat. For me, combat quickly became trivial (I'll note here that I was playing on normal difficulty). It was very Trek like, which I appreciated, but I found it to be very easy. Even when I fought two ships at once, after the first encounter even that was lacking in difficulty. I say this not because I need the game to be as brutal as FTL can be, but because I soon found myself completely ignoring the threat level of sectors. The Skorn just weren't a threat, and that's a shame. Lastly (and this may be sort of a nitpick), I thought the game was to short. At the beginning, it seems like you're really in it for the long hall. As you move along, your time is measure in days. But in actual playtime, it actually goes by really fast. I got to the end in maybe an hour and a half.\n\nI want to like this game. I want to LOVE this game. It has so much potential, but there just isn't enough there. I'd love to see some kind of expansion that adds more content. Until then, I don't see myself playing this again.","March 5","false","1.0"," 76 of 91 people (84%) found this review helpful","84","76","91","0","2"

However, I would not recommend it in its current state. I it has been improving over time!\n\nOverall it is an okay game. Falls short in most categories and it doesn't seem to be any one aspect (other than graphics) that really nails it.\n\nCivilian management system- Adds a bit more depth, looking forward to seeing how this feature is developed.\n\nBalance- More combat balancing is still needed. The addition of an "evade" option was helpful.\n\nCombat- Game over if you face more than two enemy ships at once. Equipment and crew choices  impact how your ship preforms, but poor combat balancing still makes for a frustrating experience. I'm not a fan of the combat mechanic as it feels like a game you would play on a mobile device (match the colors!)  However, resource use and management is on track. Assigning crew and the leveling system add flavor.\n\nGraphics- Great! You will very much enjoy looking out the window, but don't expect the same level of refinement with combat graphics.\n\nControls- Need to make the controls able to be modified by user. I'm (still) left handed. Come on now. (This is early access, hope this is one of the first things changed). Need to be able to save without quitting.\n\nGameplay- Good pacing, keeps you making quick decisions.\n\nStoryline- Would like a bit more depth, and for the enemy to be less one-sided. (Are these guys Cylons or what?)\n\nMap- How about a proceeduraly generated map instead of the same map every time? maybe in a future update....\n\nOther- the enemy no longer "finds" you far too quickly, just fast enough to keep you running for your life. Major improvements in this area. Perhaps they can still add a feature for stelth (running engines at half speed would make you less detectable for example, but you would take longer moving and use more resources)\n**Will edit as game updates**","September 15, 2015","false","13.1"," 122 of 164 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","122","164","0","11"

I didn't expect this game to be this dissapointing. When you look at the screenshots and videos on the store page, the game looks like a high quality indie game, but actually it is a very very poor quality game. The only high quality thing is when you fly around in space, but even that gets old really fast.\n\nThe menus are a complete joke. Is it that hard to make good looking menus? They look extremely amateurish. And that is a big problem, because a huge of part of this game is doing things in menus. That's right. This game is almost a text adventure. But the presentation of that text is extremely boring and dull. A game which does this much much better is FTL. The presentation in that game is so much better even though that is a 2D game and there is also a lot of text based things.\nThe events you encounter on planets are extremel dull and boring, you don't even need to read the text really. The background pictures for the events are terrible. But the thing is also from a gameplay perspective they are all boring as hell, because there are no interesting rewards.\nGetting new modules doesn't really feel like a reward, because you never get to see those modules anyway. The modules are also just texts in menus and better modules don't really have better effects. In FTL on the other you can see your entire ship. When you get a new system you can see how it is installed in a room and you can tell a crew member to man that system. Also when you upgrade the modules it gets new or better abilites. And FTL has tons of modules, it is impossible to have every module in the game in one ship. There are lots of decisions involved what module to choose and what module to upgrade. Into the stars has NOTHING of that.\nThe ship management is a complete joke. Well there isn't any ship management, you have city management, which is extremely weird. The proportions of the ship feel really weird. Apparently you have 10.000 people in that tiny space back in the ship, which IS tiny, if you compare it to how big the cockpit is.\nThe city management feels completely unneccessary and feels like they just added it to hide the fact that this game lacks any depths, so they just throw more stuff in it. But the city management itself is also extremely dull and annoying.\nThe game has lots of small annoying things, like how you always have to wait for that stupid animation when you switch to cockpit view, or how you sometimes have to press the button for free camera multiple times.\nThe mining mini game is another thing which just feels completely unneccessary.\nThe combat is the biggest joke of this game however. This is probably the most dull combat system I have ever seen in my life. Their poor attempt to give the combat depth with those weird frequency things is laughable. You just look at your enemy, choose a different color than his shield. That's it. You look at the enemy attack's color, choose the same color for your shields, that's it. Doesn't help that the animations are TERRIBLE, the evade animation made me laugh loudly in my room. And while the design of the player ship is really cool, the enemy ships look really bad and uncreative.\n\nMan there is much about this game I don't like I probably even forgot half of it, and that is a big shame, because from the screenshots and videos this seemed like a really cool game, like a 3D FTL, but FTL is a billion times better. Don't compare this to FTL, just don't. All this game achieved is make me want to play FTL again.\n\nThe worst thing is I can't get a refund because I bought this from a third party website, even though this is probably the game that deserves to be refunded the most from all the games I refunded so far.","March 7","false","1.8"," 83 of 105 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","83","105","2","7"

It's all about time management and hard decisions, such as working out how long you dare stay at one planet mining for essential resources without risking a fatal Threat Level Red battle encounter.\n\nThe chase across space is what makes this game feel exciting, despite the restriction of feeling confined to the captain's chair. Cutting about the galaxy at top speed, wondering if you dare veer off to explore that red planet that'll take you further from your ultimate goal (but may also stop you all starving to death), this is the good stuff.\n\nInto the Stars gameplay video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5k5JEgh9NCU\n\nThere are other more obvious decisions the game throws at you - dialogue boxes that ask you if you want to investigate one of three points of interest on an away mission for potential reward or disaster - but it's the ongoing supply management issues that bring the game to life.\n\nThere's also a surprising 2D action mini-game to play - the further you drill into the planet, the more supplies you get to bring back to your ship.\n\nCombat is straightforward - you can face up to 3 ships at once. One is trivial, two require careful use of shielding and three require a nerve of steel! There's no tutorial in the release I played but once you figure out that red shields protect against red weapons, yellow shields protect against yellow weapons etc, you feel a lot more in control of the encounters and feel like losing was because you made bad decisions under stress (or kept clicking the wrong damn thing!) rather than the game being unfair.\n\nI really look forward to seeing how this game develops in early access - it's a tough game as it stands and it should stay tough, but giving the player a little more leeway for exploration of this huge world to go along with the thrill of the chase would be brilliant.\n\nThis review is of the pre-release of the early access version.","July 9, 2015","true","5.9"," 61 of 76 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","61","76","0","0"

HOWEVER, the game is solid, I have had none of these "Horrible UI" complaints.\n\n+Excellent graphics\n+Excellent, if a bit bare, soundtrack\n+Excellent sense of threat and danger in the world\n+Being able to control the ship with the keyboard is a nice touch for this kind of game.\n+Combat is fun and the shield and weapon frequency mechanics are nice.\n+Being able to set up your ship with different resource consumption and price is nice\n+Interesting premise, saving humanity is always fun.\n\nOk, now for the minuses\n\n-Combat is a little too frequent, however I believe the devs have spoken to fixing this\n-No control configuration as of yet.\n-No tutorial (however the devs have posted guides to help with combat on the forums as far as I know)\n-Frequency of dangerous events on the ship is quite high. (Difficulty is being adressed)\n-Lack of many resolution options (Also being adressed)\n-The game needs more weapon types besides just two\n\nAll in all, I recommend the game, even for the price to many.  If 20 dollars is too steep for Early access, it might be wise to wait.  However, if you're a Sci Fi nut like me, and love games like FTL, then this game is for you.

Spice (Out There). And everything nice. These were the ingredients chosen to create the perfect space survival simulation. But Fugitive Games accidentally added an extra ingredient to the concoction... Chemical X (bugs, performance and other issues).\n\nImpressions\n+ The game delivers an excellent captain's hotseat experience. I want to scream "Captain on deck!".\n+ A real sense of urgency to reach Titus Nova especially early game where the crew is inexperienced and modules tend to be one sided, highly costly and not very resource friendly. The game brutally teaches you the importance of foresight and progression.\n+ Stunning visuals. The ARK-13, distant stars, asteroid field and even solar flares look gorgeous. Nailed it all!\n+ Great sound effects and brilliant score by Jack Wall.\n+ Planetary exploration, probe deployment and the mining mini game are well done and challenges the player's morals. Planetary exploration could do with more scenarios and variety in rewards - i.e. increase to population, implementable alien city constructs, researchable blueprints.\n+ On board city, crew, resource and engineering management tools are nice additions. Could do with greater city management freedom and features.\n+ The ability to switch between the Captain's chair and exterior camera helps with navigation and appreciation of the universe.\n\nEarly access considerations and dev feedback\n- There is a performance issue and possibly a memory leak issue too. The game is a CPU hog and demands plenty of juice.\n- Slight delay between mouse clicks and game response.\n- No hotkeys. Almost entirely dependent on mouse clicks. Controls cannot be reassigned or tweaked in any way.\n- The ship alert system needs fixing. Quite often I found it would loop (as if bugged; continuously repeating) the presence + approach of Skorn or trade vessels, depletion of resources or increase in threat level.\n- Trade ships, enemy patrols and warped Skorn ships quite often incur bugs and freeze in place or fail/block interaction.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=590312946\n\n- Lack of variation in alien encounters, Skorn ship types and enemies. I discovered only one other alien race (Menhit) and had a short exchange of fire. Mercenary ships, pirates, hostile alien species also in seek of refuge or other threats in the Gamma and Delta sectors would add to the variety of threats present.\n- I enjoyed the overwhelming combat mechanics and 3v1 scenarios, but it becomes a case of constant repetition after the first few playthroughs. Variation in enemy types and Skorn vessels may help spring new combat methods.\n- Limited trade features. Previous ship modules are lost rather than scavenged or traded for resources. Also needs a galactic trade or space station of some sort (possibly in the Sigma Sector) where trade rates are a little less unfair and one sided. Can also boast a store to purchase (with resources or other means of currency) specific modules or hire crew members. This might even dare players to plunge into the depths of the Sigma Sector other than to reach Titus Nova in the shortest time possible.\n\nI will update this review post update, patch and release","January 2","true","24.5"," 50 of 65 people (77%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","77","50","65","12","0"

Beautiful graphics, gameplay like Bridge Commander and FTL combined and incredibly difficult to boot. This game is an absolute treat. I can't help but feel like an actual Captain aboard a vessel in space... I've had to catch myself from saying, "Warp One, Engage!" while increasing the speed of my ship... if only someone added a Patrick Stewart voice pack then this game would be perfect.\n\nSeriously though, there is a nice combat system that is based on color coded frequencies utilizing torpedoes, lasers and deflector shields. There are a plethora of alien races both friend and foe alike. A multitude of planets that you can send your away teams to, to find better equipment for your ship or just to salvage resources from on your long journey to a new home. You even get to customize the equipment on your ship and the crew maintaining it before you start your journey. Hilariously enough, you can even name them. There are also a ton of events that occur on the ship to make your life an absolute hell. And really, it's easy to tell that the games man challenge and focus is on resource management. You really have to wonder whether passing by "Pelia" was worth it when you're watching 100 civilians die a day. Protip, take more biomatter and oxygen than the others. Trust me, you'll be thanking me later.\n\nAll in all, this game is absolutely amazing and I readily recommend it to any, and everyone who ever dreamed of piloting their own Star Ship. Now excuse me, I take my leave to don a Fleet Commander outfit and blow up some alien scum.\nEarly Access Video Review:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n24dUXaDpuw","July 9, 2015","true","2.2"," 50 of 67 people (75%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","75","50","67","8","6"

It's an understandable setback!" But really, it is. When you buy an Early Access game, you KNOW it isn't finished, you're supposed to be reviewing what has been made thus far. With Into the Stars, the progress made is amazing.\n\nPros -\n\nGraphics are good, but runnable. There is a slight "graininess" to them ingame, but it is easily dismissable by the rest of the space around you.\n\nGameplay is fun, and though at times repetitive, it is certainly always different in terms of difficulty. Remember, this game is meant to be similar to FTL's genre of gameplay, and if you didn't like it, you probably won't like this.\n\nThe things you come across in space so far are always interesting, and you almost always have to make that tough decision of sending out one of your trusted shipmates and the possiblity of never seeing them again.\n\nThe difficulty is playable, but you will certainly need a few runs to get used to the learning curve. Like I said before, it's similar to FTL, so you'll need to get used to it.\n\nThe controls themselves are simple and easy to use w/ a good amount of fluidity to your ship, so even if it does move rather slowly, this makes sense.\n\nCons -\n\nThe amount of different events that you'll come across are decent enough but lacking the diversity to really immerse you in the game efficiently.\n\nThe amount of ships in the game is limited and while you certainly feel that the ship is at your command, it doesn't make you feel as though you're actually connected to the ship in any way other than it's now your responsibility.\n\nThe weapons in the game are your classic laser & torpedo duo and the effects are pretty, but after awhile you get used to it and it doesn't surprise you anymore as to the effects. The different "types" of weapons (damage and charge time differences) aren't really enough to fill the gap.\n\nGlitches come into the game fairly often, but none of them are gamebreaking, more of just small nuisance that is easily fixable by player, but they can certainly be tedious. Though, this is expected, just something to be mindful of running into.\n\n--------\n\nIf you're looking for a tutorial to play the game, there is a guide in the Guides section of the game's Steam page.\n\nAll in all, I'd definitely recommend the purchase as the game itself is very fun, but as of right now, the replay value isn't of significant importance to really come back more than once or twice. If you want to see this game become more diverse and enjoyable - though it already really is - BUY IT.","July 13, 2015","true","9.3"," 42 of 54 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","42","54","4","0"

Ultimatly, there was not a great deal to do despite the games outward large-sized scope.\n\nIt could use a good dozen additional components and mechanics to give it a better run. For example it should have more frequent encounters with NPC ships that offer more options beside mere trade. Additional options upon reaching a planet would have been appreciated as well.\n\nGood marks on effort - ultimatly lacking on its delivery.

After that you will see "success chance" and can pick one of three options. If succeed - gain reward, if not - gain problems.\n\nPS I've bought the game because of the soundtrack by Jack Wall.

And since the game speed is so low.. let me touch on that.\n- Game speed. Mixed with the pacing above but the game just has bad use of user interaction and timing. The 'command pause' is not always availble, including in moments where you'd want it by default on, like when interacting with planets. You're left at the mercy of shoddy animations that take too long to load up menus while you're on the clock. I have a vague feeling that using Mining Probes is a better choice than Mining Rigs in the long run specifically because the animations and time you spend  in sector is smaller, and you draw less of attention from the enemies. This is /not/ proper use of player agency within the context of game mechanics.\n-Combat itself isn't horrible, but there is one single questionable design choice.. Misses. The enemy never misses, yet you do. Then again, i agree that so far what i've played your ship is quite a lot stronger, but the fact of SO many misses makes the initial weapon choice moot. Any long-charge, high-power-per-shot weapon is a ♥♥♥♥♥ier variant when compared to the higher rate of fire/charge ones just because of misses. The only choice is how much you want to micro the colors/frequency matching, but that shouldn't be a choice in itself.\n\nThose aside, everything else can be chalked up to Early Access issues. Things like control, optimisation, animations and balance as well as placeholder names and unintuitive UI. If i want to play a great space roguelike with fantastic replayability, pacing and balance, i'll be playing FTL some more.\n\nTo note, i did Kickstart this, but i will be leaving this to stew for a good year or two until they sort it out, since for now, i wouldn't recommend it to anyone if they'd ask me for a single choice of a game to play.","July 20, 2015","false","2.3"," 42 of 62 people (68%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","68","42","62","0","2"

(No wonder since it's composed by Jack Wall - Mass Effect series)\n\n\nCons:\n- Ugly UI - I guess guys will work on that, it's fully functional now, I'm just talking about cosmetics.\n- Fight can be a bit dull sometimes. In bigger fights you need to micromanage weapon and shield frequences faster and that's better.\n\n\nI won't take game balance as a minus since it's in development, but I should mention it here. Currently, the game is really hard cause it often happens that after a fight you've won, you send your injured officers to repair ship or in sick bay and then get attacked by two or three ships. Of course that leads to death since you don't have avaialable officers to take their positions on the bridge and you are doomed. This will be changed as the game will be tweaked.\n\nIf you love Battlestar Galactica as a story, you will like this. Your homeworld is destroyed and you have a capital ship with 10k civilians and need to run away from Scorn and find a new homeplanet.\n\nIf you love FTL, this is basically FTL in 3D space, more or less. I loved FTL and this was familiar since the moment I started playing.\n\nIf you don't hate Early Access and consider yourself a patient, mature gamer, give Into the Stars a chance.","July 10, 2015","true","2.6"," 24 of 32 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","24","32","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/diepigeons/recommended/360510/","diepigeons","Commander Shepard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/diepigeons/","76 products in account","Honestly this game should still be in EA, it doesn't feel like a finished game to me, it's just soooo boring. FTL keeps you entranced I can't say the same for this game.\n\nPopulation alerts:\n\nThe population alerts or whatever they call them are just a joke. You literally get one every few minutes then just click a crew member to do it, when I was looking into buying the game that really captured my interest thinking they might flesh it out but nope. You click on the crew member and after like 30 seconds it's over and it just keeps happening again and again and again, it's boring.\n\nAway missions:\n\nThe away missions are.... uninteresting, it doesn't really matter which one of the three you pick they're all pretty uninteresting and just go down to a roll of a dice and you can't even influence or take part in any of the decisions like per say in FTL where you could fight off a boarding party that might've happened due to a text choice you made. You just click a mission pick the people with the best stats and send them off roll the dice, repeat over and over and over.\n\nCombat:\n\nCombat is probably the most user involving feature of this game, you match frequencies (colors) to shields/weapons and all that jazz.\n\nCity Management:\n\nCity management is just... weird, like it was just slapped on to complete a list. My understanding of it you make buildings with resources to get stat buffs to your populations like adding a police station or whatever they call it to increase security in your civilian populations. It's completely bare bones, pretty much like everything in this game.\n\nConclusion:\n\nI hardly ever write somewhat detailed reviews besides occasional thumbs up and short wording so my friends will know I like it. Into the Stars was an exception, it just disappointed me so much that I had to give my two cents. The whole captain simulation gave me a nerdgasm because I love Star Trek and I love FTL so I bought into the EA after watching a little bit of play throughs on the youtube and thought they'd add some more features... they didn't, not to my standards anyway.\n\nWhat they added to my knowledge:\n\n- Difficulty modes (good job on that one)\n\n-City Management\n\n- Minor tweaks like allowing you to send away teams down more than once\n\n\ntl;dr\n\nThis game isn't anywhere near finished, it's monotonous and has absolutely no depth.","March 12","false","3.2"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I was one of the unfortunate ones who were getting stuck behind the Nebraska error. After some attempts I requested a refund. Then an update came out. Loving what I had been seeing, I chanced getting it again. Still prevented by the error :(.\n\nSome time passed and a work-around came about involving an update to WMSIE. Viola it worked!!\n\nI was beyond jazzed because everything I read, saw, heard was exactly the game I felt I needed to stave off the fiend until No Mans Sky comes out. time for the nitty gritty.\n\nThe game is as described. A combination of Bridge Commander, FTL, and several other space born titles. At first it can feel over whelming. LOTS of details.\n\n"Like being on a date with a Librarian, who also is chocolate for the eyes"\n\nThe setup is a big deal as if effects the rest of your ability to survive in the vastness of space. Crew finding is relatively easy, able to sort them by highest rating in their fields and found the crew set up the easiest, although not quite sure of the necessity of a toughness trait, often ignoring it to double up on engineers.\n\nThe hardest (or I should say toughest choice) was the modules. While the urge to get modules that use the same resources, you will discover certain planets can only be mined for specific ones...in  other words, your Ark maybe based around a lot of CO2 usage but find a planet that contains none.\n\nThis is usually the first error I can see made during the first attempt at playing\n\nThe difficulties however are easily tempered through multiple plays....but still can seem overwhelming at first.\n\nOnce past the multiple set up screens you are greeted with a beautiful scenery of planets, asteroids, suns and all sorts of anomalies. The feeling of being able to go anywhere is amazing.  The controls are simple, up down left right roll.\n\nThe game is a graphical beast for sure. The suns have solar flares, the planets have rings of asteroids, there's even half cracked destroyed planets frozen in time.\n\nExploring and taking int eh sights is an easy thing to get lost in immediately in this game. The urge to push on is apparent right off the bat, JUST to see more space related eye candy.\n\nBut then comes the first 'break' from this joy. The constant pursuit by the main enemy race in the game. The Skorn. Now I understand the desire to have this element. It gives a constant urgency to keep mushing on. It did however leave me annoyed often when trying to explore a new area, just to find I am getting tracked before even finding anything. BUT its a minor issue and like I said, keeps the constant feeling of 'keep on pushing on', which does force a positive need to progress forward whether u want to or not.\n\nThe space battles are my biggest frown. Often the same battle consisting of 1-3 enemy ships which pretty much may vary in design, but still consist of the same. Now I haven't indulged the game 100% so I am unsure if any other enemy but the Skorn fight you, but have played enough to be able to say I'm pretty sure you don't. This leaves a bitter lack of creativity int he battles. You get into a battle, try to disable a ships weapons, finish them off repeat if more ships. Often battles being purely determined on the ability to be lucky, and your shots come in contact with their targets. However once 'experienced' these battles often become routine, and make little impact other than slowing you down some OR rarely sometimes the rewards from such giving a much needed resource boost. At first, a nice mechanic to the game but ultimately becoming a 'sigh' moment.\n\nThis would be, as the developer, my primary focus when it comes to altering, upgrading, altering the game. More alien vessels to combat, more options in combat, howabout the simple ability to flee would be nice sometimes, even a boarding ability. Often the battles fall on the same 3 basic principles. Phasers, torpedoes, shields. It becomes paper rock scissor type combat. It is attempted to be deeper through a color coordinated battle scheme (red shields absorb red weapons etc) but this falls kinda flat and small enhancement to a drab combat system. It needs to be deeper, enhanced someway, perhaps some form of mini-game to determine effectiveness, accuracy, rate of fire etc. It simply needs to be more in depth especially being 1/3 of the games entertainment.\n\nNow aside form combat the games meat and potatoes come from surviving. Managing resources, and finding the methods to go from one end to the other in the galaxy. The sites again, are amazing. The aura, and feel of different parts and lighting effects give a sensed of dream like state, as you approach a sector of random marvel.\n\nhowever with the grandness that comes with it, multiple plays lead to a 'almost cramped feeling'> the galaxy is universal, each play has the same layout. While it has TONS of sights, playing many play through's makes even this large galaxy seem small. BUT even so, the sights and number of anomalies leave more to discover even after my 15th play.\n\nThe galaxy is large and the limitations of randomness, are only enhanced by an obvious attention to detail. Random alien vessels litter the galaxy but often only provide a lackluster trading opportunity. This was quite disappointing as I was hoping to combat some of the other vessels and they end up being a minor 'mix' in the formula. Forgettable at worse, minor help at best. It would be nice if the event offered more, like a side mission or something.\n\nPlanetary exploration is descent distraction in the game. Especially when fighting to survive with moments when low on resources, like those that provide food or air, or fuel. Most the time these visits to planets involve drilling for resources which is based around a mini game of guiding a 2d drill into the ground going over the resource squares you need. A simple mechanic but often entertaining as when in a hurry find yourself eager to go fast but with haste often find yourself hitting the 'bad squares' that stop the drilling altogether. This can be frustrating when dealing with an impending patrol and a dire need for fuel/air/food necessity. BUT however is tempered with the simple mechanic the more u drill the easier the drilling becomes...with more risk comes greater reward. And after a few ship upgrades the battles become relatively easy so the desire to suck as much resources is an often tease....stockpile and fight, or get a quick fix and flee.....\n\nNow throughout your travels you will often have ship born emergencies. Stuff from a random viral outbreak, to space raccoon's making a mess. These missions are relatively handled the same way. Assign a crew member to it, depending their level in the particular skill required depends on the rate they finish the objective. A past time event usually only causing issues when finding yourself with many on board ship issues at once and suddenly being attacked as each device needs a crew member to work (phasers, shields, missiles, medical). Not really a major feature but does keep you micro managing things.\n\nFor the price the game is worth it. There's many more features but not enough space to list them. You love space games, you will love this game. With its flaws, still is a gem that needs some more polish!","October 15, 2015","true","27.8"," 29 of 45 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","29","45","3","0"

This is its story...\n\nHumanity has been under attack by an alien aggressor known as "The Skorn" for a decade.\nThis is a battle we are losing, drained of resources and manpower defeat is inevitable.\nThe light of humanity is flickering out, but there is a plan, a final hope to avoid extinction.\nA fleet of massive Ark ships have been built, these huge ships will carry the remnants of humanity away from danger, away from everything we've known, fleeing into the darkness in a last desperate effort to escape the Skorn.\n\nThe ships have all left now, save one, the fatefully named Ark 13.\nThe remnants of humanity, 10,000 souls, are crammed on board the last great Ark ship.\nAs final preparations are underway some important decisions need to be made.\nSome equipment still needs to be installed, a crew needs to be assigned and resources need to be allocated.\nThese are decisions to be made by the captain of this last best hope, that captain is you.\n\n\n"She'll do the Kessel run in under 12 parsecs"\n\nYour first day as captain will see you finalising your requirements for Ark 13.\nShe's your ship now, your responsibility and as soon as you launch into the game you're going to have to start making the tough decisions.\n\nArk 13 might be a big ship, but she's going to need a lot of equipment to support the 10,000 evacuees crammed onto her decks.\nWith space at a premium, you're going to have to choose your components wisely.Starting with the ships core systems, you're going to need to choose an engine (to get you moving), a life support system (to keep you breathing) and a protein sequencer (to keep you fed).\nThese core components are vital and you have a selection to choose from, each with its own benefits and drawbacks.\n\nChoose a big powerful engine and it might give you an impressive top speed (handy for staying one step ahead of the Skorn) but it's going to take up a lot space which will limit your other component choices.\n\n\n"Do not be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed"\n\nIt's not just a balancing act between space requirements and function either, there's something else you need to consider too.\nYou see, each component you install requires resources to function.\nDifferent systems need different resources, and consume them at different rates.\nThere are five resource types in the game, Hydrogen, Carbon Dioxide, Bio-matter, Nitrogen and Magnesium. Your overall reliance on these elements is going to depend on your final component configuration which leads to some agonising decisions.\n\nFor example you might consider an engine which only consumes Hydrogen, but does so at an alarming rate. It might be good to only have to worry about one resource type to keep you moving, but if that's a resource you have trouble finding when your fleeing through the inky blackness of space you could end up drifting unpowered until everyone on board either starves or suffocates (unless the Skorn find you first... at least then your end will come more quickly).\n\nMaybe an engine that requires two or more resources would be a safer option, it'll probably consume them at a slower rate, but then you need to worry about being able to track down multiple resource types to keep the fires burning.\nRemember, it's not just the engines that need resources, everything you install on the ship will have its own resource requirements when its active.\n\n\n"She may not be much to look at but she's got it where it counts!"\n\nAt least with the core systems you'll know that you definitely need one of each type installed, this however isn't necessarily true when it comes to the secondary components.\nOne way or another you're going to need to harvest resources if you're going to survive for any prolonged period of time onboard the Ark.\nThat makes some form of exploration and mining equipment pretty essential too.\n\nIf you want the ability to send away teams down to a planet's surface you'll need a shuttle bay.\nA mining rig will be needed if you're planning on some heavy duty resource extraction, a mining probe might be handy too, as with the core systems, each secondary component comes in variety of flavours each with their own resource consumption requirements.\n\nWhen you've settled on your core systems and resource gathering capabilities there's another set of systems you'll need to think about, shields and weapons.\nAll your efforts will be for naught if the Skorn catch up with you and you can't defend yourself.\n\n\n"I've made a lot of special modifications myself"\n\nI hope you've still got some room left after installing all those components because you're going to need to store your resources somewhere too.\nWhatever space you have left you can fill with cargo bays, the more bays you equip, the more resources you'll be able to carry with you.\nThe more stuff you can carry the further you can go without the need to stop and mine.\nPause anywhere for too long and the Skorn are going to find you....\n\nYou'll get to fill your cargo holds up with whatever resources you think you'll need before you launch but this won't last you long, you're survival is going to depend on acquiring new resources to restock your constantly dwindling supplies.\n\n\n"We would be honored if you would join us"\n\nOne last thing before you begin your perilous journey, you'll need to ...

Your ship hardly moves at full speed and the combat is simple but incredibly difficult are some of the larger issues. Once the skorn catch up with you, 1 on 1 combat is easy and not very exciting. Once you get further or stay in an area too long you end up with 2 or 3 on 1 combat which is incredibly difficult. You have no option other than fighting and your shield will be down most of the fight and you will take heavy damage, what's more frustrating is how long it takes to destroy an enemy ship your crew is almost consistently missing making it very difficult to take advantage of any situation.\n\nYour ship hardly moves when at full speed making the game drag on, during this time there are miniscule tasks you will have to make your crew take care of inbetween mining/exploring planets and being attacked. Nothing particularly interesting or fun about them just annoying. If you spend too much time on a planet the skorn will catch up to you and you will be attacked. I might be misinterepting this part of the game because it gave the illusion that it was turn based at this point but it seemed like the skorn will still coming at you in real time?\n\nGenerally the game just isn't very exciting and once you understand the little thing it really isn't all that interesting. The game feels to be mostly luck based and has a very low skill cap with little you can do about it which just isn't very fun. Maybe they will polish it up and revamp some parts of the game to be more fun but until then I wouldn't recommend this game.","July 12, 2015","false","122.6"," 34 of 57 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","34","57","0","3"

Faced with a series of tough survival decisions you'll constantly be on the run from the mass-murdering alien Skorn, you'll be fighting them off when you have no other option, and you'll be scrounging for every last resource you can get your hands on to survive and complete your journey.\n\n\nI'll start the actual review by saying that I'm new to this genre. I've never played FTL, and quite a few of the negative reviews seem to be here because people are comparing Into The Stars to FTL. Sadly, ITS appears to be losing the intergalactic battle.\n\nHowever, I have played almost 14 hours of Into The Stars in addition to the 5 or so I must have played at a friend's house on their Steam account before I rushed home to buy my own copy.\nEven though I'm new to this type of game (feel free to decide for yourself how valid this review is) I can definitely recommend Into The Stars. Here's why:\n\n\nPROS\n- Good graphics, excellent sound effects, and wonderful ambient music that immerse you in  an outer space race for survival. Immersing the player in the game world is the most crucial aspect of a game, and Fugitive Games have definitely succeeded in this area.\n- A constant pressuring feeling that you’re always fleeing from a mass-murdering, evil race of aliens due to your onboard AI alerts and the Skorn patrol ships you can see scouting the sectors of space.\n- Excellent starting customisation options for your ship, your cargo, and your crew that can make a big difference to your survival success.\n- A surprisingly fun mining mini-game.\n- A good number of very interesting ship upgrades to be found by risking the completion of shuttle missions. Such upgrades could include a faster engine, stronger shields, or a module that increases the effiency of your life support system thus making your oxygen supplies last longer.\n- Every decision you make could affect your survival. Staying on a planet a little while longer to mine for essential oxygen could allow the Skorn to find and destroy you. You have to weigh up every decision.\n- Very polished for an early access title.\n- Combat is simple but good fun and challenging.\n\n\nCONS\n- With a relatively small map, and no apparent randomisation of stars and planets, the replay value is good, but not great.\n- The game does need more breadth and depth to create longer lasting appeal for players.\n- Still has quite a few bugs, none that were game-breaking (at least not in my experience), but this is to be expected from early access.\n\nOn a final note, yes, the combat can be very hard and even very unfair - especially towards the start of the game. To get around this you need to train up your engineers so that their shooting becomes more accurate (I've had late game engineers who've almost never missed), and you need to avoid large fights. So in other words, flee an area as soon as you're given a yellow alert, and avoid Skorn patrol ships like the plague.\n\n\n***18th December 2015 UPDATE***\n\n-The devs have really listened to their fans and have now made it possible for the enemy ships to miss when shooting at your ship. Before, they had a 100% success rate of hitting you.\n-The game now has an evade (dodge) feature that allows you to move out of the way of all incoming fire. This is especially useful if different Skorn ships are attacking you with different colour-coded weapons at the same time (your shields can block only one colour-code at a time).\n-To offset these two new ways of making combat fairer on the player, Skorn ships have a new weapon. This is a very powerful charged laser attack for which you get plenty of warning. The only way to avoid taking damage from this devastating weapon is to use the game's new evade feature.\n\n\nAs always, leave any questions below and I'll get back to you.\nHappy space ventures!","November 13, 2015","true","17.4"," 23 of 37 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","23","37","0","9"

Every planet feels the same as the last. You can lose thousands of civilians and feel nothing, you just see a smaller number on the display.\n\nYou can meet the occasional spacefarer on your travel, however it is simplified down to either fight or click a trade. Combat can be tricky when there are numerous enemies, however you have no control aside from clicking to evade, shield or attack when the cooldown expires. Oh, and match three colours...

There are so many areas you need to keep tabs on. It's hard work being a starship commander. From assigning the right crew members for the right jobs, to installing the right upgrades to the necessary equipment... It all matters very much.\nLosing a crew member on a shuttle mission to the surface of a planet actually has a very strong meaning. Ship systems going offline caused me to stress out.

I have a personal conflict.  I want to encourage this developer, and be positive due to what this game could be with such ridiculous ease, and I don't want to be a sucker who gives someone too much credit while they take advantage of people.\n\nThis game gives me the impression that one of six things happened.\n\n1. A few established people tried to help a friend get started, and he didn't follow through.\n2. Someone wants to test minimum development that makes a game (possibly interesting).\n3. Someone wants to test the minimum fulfillment that isn't Kickstarter fraud.\n4. A new, small team got started, fell out, and quit (would be sad).\n5. Someone decided to milk Kickstarter and Steam for easy money without doing any work.\n6. A solo dev had something really bad stop their work. (would be sad)\n\nThis game has potential that could be so easily realized that I know programmers who could finish it in an afternoon, and I could in a weekend, tops.  The interface simply isn't finished.  It has a mutually contradictory design philosophy (a short board game design that isn't short and is more RPG than board game).  It has had the same crashing and freezing bugs for six months as of this review, apparently (according to a dev post) arising from dependencies on Internet Explorer (weird and alarming).  Saving and loading are not implemented, and it deletes its own saves (player is punished for the design self-contradiction).  Its most interesting feature (away missions with stories) may be completely faked with decisions that do nothing.\n\nIt's like a game was just almost made.  Just almost.  It's like someone worked hard enough at a sham that they almost accidentally made something anyway.  Or it's like something really neat was in the works, and then something went terribly wrong.\n\nThere may be an explanation.   If at least the interface is finished, the crashes and freezes are fixed, and saving and loading is squared away, then I could write a review that forgives the potentially faked gameplay and incomplete copy of FTL's mechanics.\n\nIt's just so close to being a complete little game while falling short with such simple things that I don't know how to react to it.  Did something bad happen to the developer?  Should I feel sympathy?  Should I be encouraging a new indie dev with the guts to get started before learning to program, so maybe they'll finish their work?  Should I feel ripped off?","March 20","false","5.9"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Glad I did before looking at the steam reviews or I wouldn't have bought it and I think it's overall been a positive experience. Think it's on sale now for $12.  I've only gotten a couple hours in, died twice due to resource loss and I think it's a good game with nice graphics and music and love the scope of things they are shoot for with the random events, rewards and feel of managing a bunch of people in a tin can fleeing crazy aliens but there are multiple issues I've have so far.  I'm going to keep playing for a while trying to figure them all out. I'm trying to remain positive but have a couple issues to note I hope will be fixed in future patches.  I like the game enough to review it and recommend with the caveat of stuff like the following to be considered.\n1. Waypoints are general direction, not specific. This game lives Adam's phrase "Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind- bogglingly big it is." When dealing with a 3 dimensional flight, I need to be able to target places more easily so I'm not flying around wasting resources correcting my course.  Also you are only allowed 1 waypoint marker. I'm not a fan of that but the inaccruate part bugs me more.\n2. Planetary interactions are difficult to note.  You collect resources and trigger events by getting close to planets then it glows and tells you to interact with it and then you stop and orbit it. Apparently there are some large asteroids in game because some of them don't allow interaction. also if you are too close to the planet and a nearby event, pressing F will warp you back to the planet and you still lose your resources.  It would be useful if all planets you can see in the sector glow, get tagged and named, since many of them look the same from far away and getting turned around and heading back to where you've previously been is annoying.\n2. Unclear instructions even with manual regarding upgrading ship. I'm trying to figure out how to improve my ship's capabilities like STORAGE. I need it badly but don't know what I have to earn or what I can do now with inventory.\n3. 3rd person camera. Little glitchy, trying to look around using middle mouse button and other buttons doesn't always work and it randomly seems to reset to forward position.\n4. Markers(?) there are, so far what I've found, blue and green 2 arrowed markers. Blue is a still event(derlict ship) and green is an alien vessel. but they are small and hard to notice in game. the map doesn't acknowledge them so you need to constantly switch between 1st and 3rd to look for them.  The awesome blue/green space gas wisps while looking nice also makes it hard to know if there is something there.\n5. Aliens. I've only been able to interact with 1 so far. But the problem was I had to speed up very quickly and run a intercept course to interact with a ship going in an unknow direction. Now this probably realistic to life but how close I had to be felt aggressive and wasteful.  A communication signal you can send at a certain point to talk would be very useful or a path marker to intercept.\n6. Planetary event that are triggered with the people you assign seem to have a random success percentage but haven't done enough to be sure.\n7. What is Nitrogen for in game? Also I ran into a engine that instead of helium ran off Biomatter which helped starve my civilians :)\n\nThat's what I have for now. I'd give it a B- with a chance for a higher grade with more improvements and tweaks but those things logically take time for developer. I think they have most of the core concepts there and with more critical reviews by people who play it it will be a decent game.","May 17","true","5.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","1"

To me it sounded a bit like FTL: Faster Than Light, but a bigger and bolder version of it. And a lot more stressful as well. I can say that I was glad to back it as it is just so much fun.\n\nThe threat of being constantly chased by the Skorn is stressful but at the same time it doesn't feel like they are constantly on your tail. I've seen a Skorn ship fly past me without bothering to attack me which made me relieved but annoyed at the same time. As I was wanting a fight but knew I was in no shape for one. And my crew doesn't really keep me calm either. I've shouted at my monitor a few times when I decided to visit a planet in an attempt to gain resources to keep my ship powered. And all because I decided to send a probe down and the crew member piloting in crashes it.\n\nResources is a big part of the game as everything on your ship is powered by resources. Use to much of one and you might find yourself either running out of food or even air supply. But with the threat of Skorn do you choose to push onto another planet, or go for the nearest one you can find and hope you find what you need,\n\nAnd with you being the captain you are faced with some tough decisions. Like in a previous playthrough of this I came across a member of the Glubdon race. Who offered me a resource I really needed in exchange I had to give up some of the people on my ship. I decided against taking their offer and hoped I would find what I needed on the next planet. Kind of wish I did take the offer as I never made it to the next planet.\n\nCombat can take a litle while to wrap your head around, basically it comes down to a colour system: blue, red and yellow. If you want to deflect an attack, let's say for this instance it's the colour red, you have to make sure you choose the red as well or else you won't deflect it. But if you want to attack them, you have to make sure you choose a different colour to what they have. So if they have red for shields, you need to choose blue or yellow. But even then your shots can miss which is something I like. Just adds to the stress.\n\nThere are a couple of tiny little problems with it, one being when I'm collecting resources, I seem to highlight the numbers. But it's a tiny little problem which doesn't really spoil the enjoyment I'm getting. And currently there is no tutorial system either which would be nice so hoping they implement it as the game development goes on.\n\nIf you enjoy games like FTL: Faster Than Light or Organ Trail, I would say give this a go, you might be surprised.","July 10, 2015","true","3.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

If you, like me, are always searching for starship sims (less Tie Fighter more Star Trek Bridge Commander), you might enjoy this game. If you aren't, however, you probably will not like this, as it is a fairly simple, shallow experience. That experience, however, does scratch that utterly maddening starship sim itch.\n\nThis game allows you to play like you're Captain Picard or Admiral Adama, which is something a lot of us really want, but not something that's often made. Most of the games in this genre are decades old, rarely talked about or even remembered, and sometimes not even capable of being played on modern machines -- even with DosBox. This game fills that very large gap. If you are looking to sit on the bridge and take command over starship systems and crew, this is for you.\n\nSo what is the game like? It basically amounts to a series of simple mobile-like minigames superimposed over a smallish 3d open world and resource management simulator. You can pick and name your captain, crew, ship loadout (everything from weapons systems to what kind of food replicators you ship is equipped with), and starting resources. The controls are not able to be changed, but they are fine as-is and not anything that you'd worry about changing anyway. For that matter the interface is streamlined and easy to use. The mini-games are actually enjoyable, if simplistic, so the game ends up being pretty fun for the price.\n\nThe only things I dislike about the game are its lack of depth (the minigames really do feel like minigames and the away missions are just randomly generated die rolls with possible stat bonuses applied as far as I can tell) and its visual style (some may like it, but I find it a hideous mess that's aesthetically similar to the worst of bargain-bin scifi crap--lots of glowing neon, random hexes getting in the way of everything, plastic-looking textures, hideous ship design, etc). These may be deal breakers for some, but I'm willing to put up with it because A) It's cheap and B) it exists in a genre that's very rarely explored.\n\n\ntl;dr It's a simpler FTL in first person, except you feel more attached to your crew and ship","March 5","true","5.2"," 21 of 36 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","21","36","3","0"

I can say many good things about it, but only thing I cannot do is recommend it. Why?\n\nSo let me explain a bit.\nWhat I expected, what I believe I was promised, was a little bit of excitement and planning of FTL, little bit of unexpectedness of a roguelike, little bit of atmosphere of Mass Effect because of the style and of course Jack Wall, and a lot of space exploration, the wonder, the excitement, learning, danger, the New Stuff that science fiction brings, whats best in Star Trek, Mass Effect, or Star Control, or the even older classics like Starflight.\nA journey.  But this is not a game of going where no man has gone before.\n\nThis is a hunting simulator and you are the fox chased by hounds. Everything else is just filling and fluff and sugarcoating. And as such its a great game. But its not what I want, or what I was promised. I dont want to pay for this.\nIf you like the feeling of rush and constant fleeing, its worth the money.\n\nI really feel like I have been lied to and my money cheated from me. This game could have been worth two or three times the price, or even more.\nThe mining minigame in Mass Effect 2 is worth more than this and gives a better feeling of space exploration, and its mostly just a bouncing wave. Just closing my eyes and listening to Jack Wall´s New Worlds is better than this whole game. Not to say its bad. It might be good. It could become GREAT. But its wrong, just wrong made worse because of what it might have been.\n\nIf the "flee from A to B" is changed to "search for a new planet" and the "constantly being hunted" is changed to\n" not especially hunted but attacked on sight" and the stupid, stupid idiotic limit of one planetary exporation per planet is removed, this could be much better.

Into The Stars  is a bit more on the 'slow paced' side and has a heavier focus on resource management than many games.   The game can seem very hard but careful management of resources early on and through mid game (just like the game FTL) can make a big difference.    The random events so far are all fun and a nice touch, the graphics are very good for a game like this!   The music is also decent and apporpriate for the genre.\n\nFor improvement, the UI is a bit touchy and sometimes counter intuitive -- although it's workable.

I think these things will come as the game approaches release.\n\nIf you're looking for a twitchy, quick shooter, or a mindless easy game - do not buy this.

I see a great deal of potential in this game.

First of all, I have 2 EVGA GTX 670's SLI'd and the game was stuttering to the point of being not playable at 1080 resolution, even on lowest settings. Kinda ticked me off but I dropped to 720 and was able to run everything on "EPIC" settings.  Even at the lower resolution the game is a joy to look at and it was buttery smooth.  I'm sure its an Early Access thing.\nAfter that I was able to start playing...This game is a great mix of games like FTL and the iOS game Out There (which you check out if you like this game). I've never played STBC.  It was really tough picking the loadout of my ship and the exact amount of resources beforehand.  Just try to make a ship that uses the least amount of different resources for your first couple of plays (not really ideal but it makes it easier to learn).  The main reason is that you have to choose how much to take with you, and splitting it all up can be hard.\nThe crew assignment is tough, you are constantly balancing fixing the ship, training, and having people ready for battle.  The battles aren't really random, from what I can tell.  If you look around you will see them coming for you, especially if the threat level rises because you stayed in the sector too long.  But I could be wrong about that.\nThe combat is hard as crap at first but once you get the whole matching vs. opposing colors thing it gets a lot easier, and timing gets kind of fun (ala FTL). I was able to hold my own against three attackers at once after a few plays.  You are screwed though if they all 3 have different color weapons, so just focus on taking out there weapons first.\nOverall,  I really like the tension in this game. You never know whats going to happen and I personally like the slower travel speed as it gives you a chance to relax and enjoy the scenery (and the amazing music by the Mass Effect guy!).  You will die. A lot.  Thats the kind of game it is.  But remember the first time you finally made it across the map in FTL, only to be blown away the very first round with the final boss?!

A lot of bugs mentioned in other reviews are already solved. I'm not going to tell the problems I had in my review because I believe they will be fixed as the devs seem to be involved actively. I will mention the problems I encounter to the devs in the forum.\n\nAs others have mentioned: it's FTL in 3D + a big Star Trek feel. The graphics are fantastic (I like the sperm-like things that fly around, have never seen that before but is much better than space debris). The user interface is ugly but that might change in the future.\n\nLots of people dislike the game for its lack of save/load functionality. They probably haven't played a lot of games in the 80's or early 90's where ironman mode was more common (or maybe more accurate: was expected to be normal). Although I dislike iron man modes in some games (they usually give a choice), I do like it in games like these. It's quite realistic that you will start your journey and that every decision you make is final. Loading a savegame to revert choices or even randoms would be cheating.\nI don't know if you can stop and continue playing though. Haven't tried that out yet. That is something I really need and hope it's there.\n\nThings I dislike:\n- It's such a cool 3D game, why are the enemies so statically in front of you, a little (maybe pointless) animation would make it so much cooler. Make it look like your pilot is maneuvering the ship so that the enemy stays in sight. Just move space around, move the enemies around. Not to make the fight harder, but just to give it a bit more action.\n- The controls are a bit strange. The map is 2D but a lot of the time, I don't really know where I am flying towards because the flying is 3D. Maybe some kind of pitch indicator could solve this? At some point on my first playthrough, I wasn't able to get back into the direction I was flying towards before I had an encounter.\n- The UI is ugly. It looks like a website made in 2003. But as I mentioned, I think I have read somewhere that the devs want to make it nicer later on.\n- I'm not sure if I like the mini-game used for drilling for resources. Where the game overal is quite a "calm" experience, the drilling part is some kind of arcade game (and I suck at it). Maybe an auto-resolve kind of option (based on the stats of the drill-man you send down) might be a good idea?\n- Although it's great that you can configure your ship with a lot of options at the beginning, it takes a lot of time to do it before you can get going. Maybe it's an idea to show the configuration from last game when starting a new one and give the ability to change it?\n\nThings I like: almost everything else!\nIt's such a great experience and I love it!\nI like how it's a slow pace game while it's still exciting.\nWatch my broadcasts when I am playing, if you're like me you will understand what's so great about this game!\n","July 19, 2015","true","9.8"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It's pretty, and at first getting to fly around manually instead of jumping from point to point like FTL had you doing was interesting, but it suffers from three major problems:  overly difficult battles, boring mining minigame and tedious alerts.  Aside from those three problems, there are some minor annoyances like an apparent lack of manual entry for resources (instead of clicking and holding on an arrow as the resource goes up or down at an accelerating rate, and then clicking repeatedly to fine tune it) or a 'take all' button for mining, and a rather clunky startup procedure.  It would be nice if they'd save your previous system selections so you could just hit 'continue' or tweak the build a little instead of doing it all over again each time, not to mention letting you see the stats of officers you've already selected and more easily compare those still waiting - say, a way to sort by a specific stat or some means of highlighting two officers so you can see how their respective stats look without picking them out from the list.\n\nThe combat is simple, but hard.  You select one of up to three (as far as I've seen) enemy ships, and then decide if you want to hit their shields, hull or weapons.  Weapons seems like the obvious choice, but to judge by the duration of the red glow and "our shot was deflected" announcements that appear to be tied to it, each of your opponents can hold their deflectors up twenty+ times as long as your ~50 command officer can.  That means that they can sit behind their apparently perfect protection while they hammer on your ship, so both shields and weapons are critically important to destroy - too bad your starting crew won't have the engineering to hit very often even if the target's shields are down.  On my second game I made avoiding combat a priority and got through four systems before they caught up to me, only to destroy me in a single two-ship combat; either the Skorn get better the farther you go, or there's some trick to combat aside from 'use weapons when available, use deflector when enemies appear to be charging weapons'.\n\nThe mining minigame is absolutely essential to your success.  You *can* send probes that bring back a small amount of each resource if you want, but you'll need to send the mining rig from time to time in order to concentrate on grabbing whatever your engines this run use as fuel.  Sadly, this minigame consists of the rig moving down at a steady rate while you control if it goes left or right to avoid obstacles (shown as flashing red or red with crosshatching, the latter being instantly fatal) and collect resources.  You have 40 seconds per deployment, at least with the rig I purchased, so expect to sit around waiting for the Skorn to catch up while sending it down three or four times in order to refuel and resupply.  Oh, and did I forget to mention that you apparently get a maximum of 200 of a resource, and have a return load capacity that you'll reach easily if you don't destroy the rig partway down?\n\nAlerts could have been interesting.  Unfortunately, they always consist of the same thing - command alert, send the crew member with the best command skill to deal with it.  Engineering alert or medical alert, send engineering or medical staff.  They'll be busy for a while, but don't sit around waiting because the Skorn will track you down and make fights more frequent.  There isn't even much in the way of description, and unless you pause and hover your cursor over the alert you'll never know that this mysterious case of space rabies comes from raccoons in the supplies.  Yes, raccoons.\n\nThis is of course an Early Access game.  I hope that everything will be improved, especially making the mining minigame more enjoyable - but as it stands now, I can't recommend this game.","July 10, 2015","false","1.4"," 25 of 46 people (54%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","54","25","46","0","4"

You can see from the screenshots yourself that the game looks incredible; maybe one of the prettiest and most evocative I have played, but the menus are amateurish and really detract from the look and feel of the game.\n\nIt’s a massive shame, but I guarantee it’ll be the first thing people notice when they boot. They won’t notice the amazing expanse in front of them, they won’t notice the ability to fly from the cockpit and amazing attention to detail that offers. It’s a shame because it’s one simple thing that will turn a lot of players off instantly.\n\nAs it stands, though, I would recommend Into The Stars to people who are willing to look past some Early Access teething pains. There’s the core of an awesome game under here, tied down by a couple of rough ideas and some dodgy execution. Look past that, and maybe have faith this stuff will get fixed, and you’re in for the game that FTL was in your mind’s eye.\n\nhttp://www.permanent-beta.net/previews/2015/8/17/early-access-investigations-into-the-stars","August 19, 2015","true","1.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

On the very first away mission I lost my pilot immediately due to surface radiation. So I needed to find a replacement for her. Around the middle of the game finally I had an elite pilot with a skill of 99, who, surprise, surprise, was eaten by some sort of seemingly peaceful alien during one of the away missions. After that I needed to find another replacement pilot who should control the mining rig as I was short on supplies. Of course the rookie pilot (Who was by the way a veteran commander with a stat of 75+) accidentaly crashed with my elite miner onboard, killing both of them on the very next day. So basically even my elite main characters acted like red shirts, and lost three officers within two days. And the game is cruel, as you definitely feel the loss of your experienced crew. So for the rest of the journey I needed to use my rookie officers to somehow survive and reach Titus Nova, and make them to worthy officers. In the end the four remaining officers became a pretty veteran crew.\n\nWhile the Early Access was very-very unbalanced, for the final release the game has a really enjoyable balance. So thank you for this great game. My only problem is that some of the achievements didn't unlock, regardless I did them. But beyond that, the game has a fantastic atmosphere where you truly need to watch for many things to survive and you really have to consider what your next step should be.\n\nSo thank you! And whoever liked Battlestar Galactica and FTL, give this game a try.

If you can get past the glitches and put yourself in the shoes of the commander, then you can find yourself on an entertaining adventure.  I would suggest buying the game on sale ($14-$15 feels about right for the game).  It seems as if the there is continued support from the game producers to improve the experience/game.

There will be a couple of issues to raise, but mostly I like it so far.\n\nFirst, this is a game where you will Die A Lot Figuring Things Out.  That's okay in a game where you can get right back in and learn from your errors.  Right now, however, you have to launch a brand new game from scratch every time --- including ship customization, crew selection, and initial supply loadout.\n\nThat gets tedious rather quickly.  The ability to save a template of your ship and resources, which you can then modify or run with as you like, would speed things up immensely without sacrificing the need to re-select from your randomized crew options.\n\nOnce in the actual game, however, it's FUN, if frenetic.  Days pass in the space of seconds, so you often feel rushed even though you really shouldn't.  Being able to scale time down somewhat, when not in combat, would let you savor more of what's going on rather than having to flit about like an ADD-afflicted squirrel.\n\nThat still doesn't detract from the feeling of discovery as you explore this immense star system and see what it has to offer, from the vantage point of your captain's chair overlooking a wide-open bridge.  Rarely have I gotten such a fresh "Star Trek" vibe from a game which has nothing to do with Star Trek (and frankly, Into The Stars does it better than most Trek games to date).\n\nThe core game engine also seems solid (from what little I've played so far).  I could not get it to run at all using the Epic settings (perhaps they're not implemented, I don't know), but even on High it was smooth as silk.  Your ship feels somewhat ponderous, as should any vessel which isn't a starfighter.  Mining was a rather interesting minigame, too.\n\nI may come back to revise this as things develop, but these are my first impressions for now.  And I have to say: even with the things I don't like so far, I don't think my $20 has been wasted.","July 10, 2015","true","1.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The art is really what sells it. You drive around a slow, really badass looking ship and then you can switch to a "star deck" view which has you sitting in a captains chair looking out at space and your managment screen. The pressure is less an art thing and more a gameplay thing, with an alien race stalking you constantly and if you are not constantly on the move with your increadibly slow ship (I used the slowest engine) then you will be attacked and it will eventually be fatal. You have to balance your need to be on the move with the need to visit planets and collect resources and ship upgrades. Honestly, it is all very stressful.\n\nThings that are not currently polished: a tutorial. There is literally no guidance, you just have to guess everything the first time around. Also some vital combat mechanics are never explained and this makes the combat stupidly hard and boring at first. With some looking around through the forums though you can find the info you need for the most part. The need to experiment in this game will make a lot of people mad, and rightfully so. A lack of a tutorial is a huge deal breaker for those who want a clear idea of what to do right away.\n\nBut I know I will keep playing this game for at least a while. It is beautiful and brutal all at the same time and this game has an actual goal unlike other space games currently, and that is enough for me. I reccomend this game to those that will be happy with a high tension game that goes at a slow pace (not relaxing, just slow).","July 9, 2015","true","7.2"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

No bugs, ship handles well, the controls are a little weird but you get used to them quickly, and everything works. Into the Stars is a bridge simulator and has you attempting to reach a point while dealing with dwindling supplies, aliens in pursuit, and issues that plague your ship. It's all well done and works to create a simple game that challenges you.\n\nBoy does it challenge you. Holy crap this game is hard. It's too hard in my opinion but hey I've only played a few rounds so far and you pick up on things as you play.\n\nThis game is a little boring and frankly feels incomplete but that's why its in early access. The following are suggestions for the developers to really make this game into something great.\n\n- reduce the difficulty or give players the option to choose different difficulties\n- tips/tutorials would help a lot\n- add dialogue and make the ship seem alive (have the crew move about the bridge, make them talk, have lights pop on to indicate various conditons, have more sounds, etc.) maybe people come into the bridge and confront you if you're doing a bad job captaining the ship; more dynamic events will make this game a LOT better\n- add more ships into the game world; I have yet to encounter anything other than enemy ships. let's get some mining ships traveling across the galaxy, bandits who might help or hinder your progress, allied ships, etc.\n- add a story to this game and some more background info. why are your civvies trying to make it to this end point?\n- add way more cutscenes, cinematics, etc. I want more things to happen when I send a shuttle team to the surface of a planet (meet other races civ style, visit cities or outposts, etc.)\n- add dynamic events where you have to choose an option of how to deal with the situation on the ship which has far reaching effects (ie. a crew member pioneers a new module that you must decide if you wish to utilize or the crew mutinies)\n- have spaceports you can visit to interact with NPC'S, sell cargo, upgrade your ship, repair your ship, etc. these could also serve as safe zones where the enemy won't attack you\n\nThis game is still recommended as your input and experiences with it will definitely help make this game grow into something spectacular. It's 20 bucks thankfully and is worth getting into at this point.\n","July 9, 2015","true","5.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Most prominently it feels like the choices for each scenario are limited and simple. Which is fine. However, this potentially quick gameplay is at odds with the stately and sedate ship movement. Similarly, the minigames (combat and mining) feel somewhat out of place, as well.\n\nPros:\n+ SciFi, I'm a sucker for it\n+ Interesting view point from bridge\n+ Potentially great replayability\n\nCons:\n-- simple systems, few choices vs. slow overall pace\n- crew assignment frustratingly unintuitive (please make it drag'n drop)\n- initial resources don't last long. Not easy to understand why. Food Replicator Bm 3... 3 what? per day? per second?\n- finding where you want to go, can be tricky (please add indicator of waypoint at screen border)\n- Flying close to a planet automatically makes it go into orbit: Engines stop, random orientation (just don't; F key is sufficient)\n- combat cues could be clearer/more interesting\n- more story/text for away missions and ship incidents, might help increase immersion\n- constant audio reminders about dying civilians and the imminent attack of your puersuers can become tedious ("Shut up, back there in the hold! I know the food replicators are offline. Shouldn't have consumed all the biomass in a single week!")\n- lengthy initial loadout process.

This game is making sizable leaps forward and I am confident that it will continue to do so.\nNow there is an exploration mode that is significantly easier due to the fact that you arn't being continually hunted.  This is super useful as an unofficial tutorial to allow new captains to get their space legs.\nThe mission system has been upgraded and offers more options for success.\nFinally combat has been improved so much its like playing a different game altogether.\nI would recomend this game to anyone who likes FTL or space sims.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vSure/recommended/360510/","vSure","vSure","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vSure/","174 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPatch .5 Review\nTLDR; Excellent visuals, great combination of a Star Trek Sim and FTL: Faster Than Light, Solid Core gameplay IDEAS but balance/execution is lacking. For $20, I’d wait. Find it on sale or wait until the content increases.\n\nVisuals:  At the very beginning I was slightly put off by the character portraits, they seemed like stickers plopped on to the uniforms and backgrounds. The second I got into the game and took a look around I quickly changed my tune. All of the stellar objects (planets, asteroids ect…) look stunning. Solar flares in-circling the stars, the surface of the planets well detailed and each one had its own character to it. The Command Chair view also has a ton of high points, if you ignore the character models and animations. The animations for the different command functions and even the simplified city all look superb. I can forgive the repeated characters (The command deck girls all look pretty much the same) I just hope they look to improve those in the future because against the rest of the game, it seems a tad out of place.\n\n\nStory: You’re the last hope of humanity running from the Scorn, your typical nomadic, devour everything in their path alien species. Pretty simple and not much explanation behind it.\n\n\nGameplay: The core of the gameplay is fairly solid. Combat is fun and the exploration side has its strong points, but the UI and its responsiveness hurts me. Sometimes it seems that what I click on doesn’t register or does slowly. Assigning crew can be a bit of a learning curve for the first few times, and all the small numbers so close to one another can send your head into a spin. One feature I’d love is while assigned to a position, the relative skill number would appear alongside the name of the skill.\n\nThe Combat itself is fun and can be intense for the first play through or two until you start to get the hang of it, and even then it has its moments of excitement as you barely bring up shields in time or duck out of the way of a laser. Audio ques are well done, mostly on point and once you learn them, have a huge part in correctly defending yourself. The issue lies in variation, it turns into the same fight over and over again. A simple strategy emerges and the skill cap is frankly quite low. You may fight against 4-5 different ships but they all are fought the same way, by the end of the third play through I was taking almost no damage verses single combatants and maybe one shot when faced against two of them, even when I finally got a 3 ship encounter, I took maybe 3 hits. My request? Toss in some variation in strategy, in enemy modules or even change up the playing field, maybe an asteroid field could provide evading ships even better defenses? Not sure about how but I know a larger variation is needed or else it becomes stale quickly.\n\nI love the resource management, even if it seems VERY overwhelming at first, a full tutorial would go a long way. Finding the correction combination of modules that suits your resource needs is a fun way to change up how you play and can decide if you really are going to stop at the planet or just book it to the next sector. The only complaint I have is the numbers on the civilization side aren’t always very clear, the biggest one being the growth stat. I have a growth of .9%! Okay, is that .9% of my population every day? Week? Month?? None seem to be quite right. Or is it not supposed to be a %, and it’s just + .9 population every day? This last one seems to be the case, but it took until my third play through to come to that conclusion.\n\nTo round things off, I love how the game makes you work for your victories, or at least seem like it. I played three runs on normal (each run seems to last 3-4 hours with the slower, more resource efficient engine) and I felt like I earned the two victories I got. I just want a climax, both times I pretty much coasted into the finish line with nothing stopping me (Abit, the second time I was bleeding population with 0 food left :D).\n\nClosingOverall, a great game for someone like me who is absolutely obsessed with space exploration and sim games, the average person might want to wait a bit longer, or pick it up for a few play throughs and come back later when the game receives more content. If you enjoyed FTL: Faster Than Light and have always dreamed of being the next Kirk or Picard, this is a must pick up.\n\nVerdict: 7/10 with tons of potential. I’ll do my best to keep up with the updates and revise as changes come along","December 19, 2015","true","8.1"," 16 of 31 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","16","31","0","1"

The graphics look great and are smooth to watch (for me anyway).  The level of detail on both your own ship, the ships of the enemies and just the universe at large are fantastic.\n\nOverall, I love the concept of the game, and can quite happily see it being a game to use as a challenge with the way it is currently set out, and will quite happily recommend it to people who like me do like to be challenged by games.\n\nI honestly can't wait to see the finished product.","July 11, 2015","true","0.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Combat mechanics are badly flawed; shields can't defend against more than one enemy at a time, and you usually face at least two. There is only one possible way to find repair parts, and it happens so rarely that you're not likely to be able to fix any damage you take before the next fight. You can't avoid combat because resource consumption is off the charts; you have to stop at every planet and gather, gather, gather until the bad guys catch up with you or you'll die from running out of fuel.\n\nAlso note, the game is pure iron-man mode. No normal save-restore; you can shut the game down and come back the next day, but you can only pick up right back where you left off. If you die, you start over.

I know I had to click on things, but what is the point?  For combat, you basically have three buttons to push and spend most of the time waiting for them to charge, then click the button.  Events happen as you're travelling and you basically click on a crew member then click on the event to have them handle it and wait until they're done.\n\nI know it's an early access game, but it seems to take a long time just to move between screens.  It would be nice to have hotkeys to put you at any screen you wanted.  I'd also dock the game for not having a load feature, you basically can only save the game when you quit and come back to the same game later.  It's easy to get around by quitting to the menu then copying your save file so the only effect is to frustrate people.  The best games let players decide how they want to play them, not have everything dictated to them by the developer.  You could always have a 'hard mode' that doesn't allow loading and 'insane' that won't even save if you quit the game.","July 18, 2015","false","1.6"," 9 of 18 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","9","18","0","1"

This one has potential. I'd really like to see it get great - my negative comments come from a place of love. Because SPAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACE\n\nVisuals are favorably comparable to the the likes of Elite & Rebel Galaxy.\n\nMining rig minigame is fun, like a non-stop arcade Mr. Driller and lets you focus on exactly what resources you're running out of.\n\nUser Interface feels not as fun as I'd like. I'd almost rather it were all hotkey driven so I could move faster. Button targets aren't always obvious. Seems like a lot of inputs don't "take" the first time. Cannot re-assign bindings, which is unfortunate because I have a trackball without a middle mouse button. I've got a Steam Controller, which works not too badly once I've configured some useful inputs.\n\nOther little UI hiccups: Crew members need to be assigned / unassigned various tasks throughout the game - I expected a drag & drop from character portrait to position, but instead it's a click & click that I always screw up. When I switch positions there are long animations - do I really need to see the various screens whip into place every time I switch to captain's chair?\n\nAnd, though I know games like this are meant to be hard, resources run out super fast. Maybe just a learning curve on the game, but all my colonists are dying by the time I hop from one planet to the next. Oh, and I've probably been stomped on by enemy patrols twice already.\n\nExplorer Mode feels like it's more my casual speed until I get used to the game. Space Barbie says being lost in space is hard, let's go shopping.\n\nSpeaking of learning curve, the first few screens of the game ask me to assemble a ship & crew loadout full of stats and resource types with no real idea as to what it's all going to do. Might help to have a few canned loadouts to at least ease us into the game.\n\nSounds like the load out issue is being addressed in the next update, so hooray!","January 8","true","4.6"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","47","9","19","2","3"

It feels like 25% of the game it should be. Everything is completely randomised, fights are uninteresting, especially with all the misses you get. It feels like you have 10% chance of anything positive happening in the game, be it hitting the enemy ship, getting resources you need, loosing the crew because of disease or revolt or whatever. The random events are just highly unlikely and not that fun to have. Also I noticed that whenever the random event occurs, there's a higher likelihood of being intercepted by scorn, so that you have one or two less crew to use for the fight or mining or whatever.\nIf I were to compare it to another game, it would be 25% of FTL content.\n\nI really hope it will evolve into a fully working and featured game. Developers seem anxious to get it done in few months, and come out of EA, but it really feels like it needs another year or more. For now, there's not enough in the game for me to play, and the gameplay is too punishing to keep playing for little to no reward.\n\nI hope to revisit this review in a couple of months if and when the game will get some most needed content updates.","July 13, 2015","false","1.7"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","1"

Fisrt off there is no option to select an actual language so the game looks who knows where to figure out what Language to install itself as. So I was getting weird bilingual text messages in the game at different times. Now when you add that to the fact I cannot select a resolution that is appropriate for my monitor then the game's enjoyement goes right out the window.\n\nSo I got the game refunded, sorry to the developpers but these issues are of a type that I have NEVER encountered before and were dealbreakers for me.\n\nBest of luck regardless.","March 6","false","1.2"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I likie the idea of hireing your own crew and taking on the resources needed for space expploration. The graphics are great, and ship interaction is cool from the captains chair, a rarety in most space sims. Resource management is critical before leaving dock, badly done and your out of fuel in no time. The most anoying thing for me at the moment is the arrival of the aliens bent on your destruction, its far to early and far to frequent for my likeing and extreamly off putting, you just dont get enough time to do anything. In fact this could be a great exploration command game with a massive universe to explore and resourses to find, with the ocassional alien contact. ( And i do mean occasionl ) leaving room to do the things a ship captain would like to do, so come on devs less aliens, and more exploration orientation. If we do meet aliens then we need room for negotiation and maybe some mutual alliances before they try to kill us.\nAlso when you do eventually die its back to the start screen, thats really old hat, no thank you devs, repairs yes even a town to the nearest space port would be cool.

What Into the Stars does well, it does very well. For other things, it is merely functional.\n\nThe good:\nInto the Stars offers an interesting take on the space ship adventure game. Ark 13 is big, slow and unweildy, exactly as you'd imagine such a big ship to be. there's no point in doing clever manoevers, you basically point and let her fly. But just because it's a slow ship, doesn't mean that as the captain you'll have nothing to do. There are constant little emergencies that require your attention, for which you need to apply your specially selected crew, and by the half way point of the mission you will know there characters quite well.\n\nThe bad: Unfortunately, when you do arrive at the planets that dot your path, the gameplay becomes mediocre. Exploring planets is little more than a menu selection, and mining for resources is a rather obnoxious mini-game.\n\nThe ugly: Combat is not optimised for PC play, and leads me to think that Into the Stars is being developed primarily for the mobile market. On its own, the act of selecting weapon frequencies and sheild frequencies is a novel idea and hearkens back to the Star Trek feel. But there are no short cuts for all the buttons, meaning you have to move the mouse, making the experience clunky and un-immersive. Secondly, the enemies float right in front of your ship, looking for all the world likethose JRPG menu based combat systems.\n\nBut I still l want to play more, and you are supposed to be avoiding conflict. I hope the developers make some changes.","July 18, 2015","true","2.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I literally only play this over morning coffee as I'm waking up and watching the news, because it's slow.\nBut it's still interesting.  The combat is the old Trek TV  show made into a game, basically.\nMy main gripe is you are constantly deciding which crew to send depending on their stats, and it's a pain to see them.  Instead of prominently displaying or highlighting who is best, you gotta scan through tiny white font on MNG to see who is the best at mining.  Little things could use some polish.\nIt can be depressing, you start with 10k people and I just watched 7k+ die from lack of oxygen.\nIt's also a bit buggy, I just got near the end of my first game and had to hard reboot twice.

It still needs some work (I know it's still in EA) and some polishing, but overall I think the game is much better than when first released. You now can adjust between three difficulty levels and actually manage your ship city which is pretty cool. That alone makes the game better.

Mainly, because anyone playing it, would eventually burn out on the title, feel like he wasted a lot of money on an incomplete game and eventually, not care when it's released. If you do not mind doing the community a favor and helping to develop a game and having to pay for doing that - go right ahead.\n\nThis, one day might be one of the most fun roguelike games on Steam but... but only when it's done. Right now - the interface is still a bit clunky and bare, the combat system is not very satisfying, some of the "events" feel like a collection of rather shallow minigames.\n\nThere's a lot of potential there, but it can't be recommended as an early access title, which is ready to play. And that's what EA was meant to be originally - a way to get in on a game, a few months (at most) earlier.\n\nOne final thought, there's no due date for the title and the devs "have no idea". As a general "I've seen this before" warning light, this usually spells disaster. I'm not seeing this title selling a lot of copies anymore - so... what they got is what they have, moneywise... When they run out - the game's gonna be another Space Base DF9.\n\nI'll consider changing the review to "recomended" if I see solid progress and an actual release date, which is not "at some point in 2016".","September 24, 2015","false","0.7"," 29 of 60 people (48%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","48","29","60","3","8"

If you are a fan of surival simulation games I think you will like this quite a lot. If you are a fan of Star Trek and Battlestar Galactica I think you will love it. For an early access game it is very polished and from the 5 hours I have played I have never experienced a ctd.\n\npresentation-\nThe graphics in this game are very well done utilizing the unreal 4 engine ( your ship will travel through space in real time with animated meteor fields, and ennemy encounters, etc It looks impressive. You can switch views on the fly from the exterior to the interior of the ship( this is where you will access the various menus and make your decisions.The ui and illustrations are also executed very well.\n\ngameplay-\nthere is a lot of thought that went into this system. The premise is that humanity is facing extinction and must move thier last colony ship through the dangers of unexplored space to locate a new homeworld. The journey cannot be completed successfully without carefully managing your resources. There are a lot of things you have to consider, and the game does a great job of forcing you to make difficult choices. There are three difficulty settings, and I found myself struggling with normal mode because I was a noob and put all my resources into outfitting my ship with powerful weapons to fight the skorn( the skorn are an alien race trying to wipe you out as you forge a path to the new homeworld.) Because of this all my colonists died of starvation lol. So I started over on easy until I better understood how to balance my ships attributes. Certain parts you choose may be more powerful, but they will also consume more of a specific resource so you really have to be smart about how you initially set up your spacecraft when you start a new campaign. Along the way you will have to restock your resources,( i think there are 8 total attributes?) through mining minigames, and what you focus on mining in these mini games also directly relates to your overall ship composition. I think there is a great deal of customizabilty here and I'm interested in seeing what the devs have in store, regarding possible upgraded parts in the full release?\n\nif you are a fan of these survival simulation strategy games you should definitely check this out. My only gripe is that in order to save your game you have to choose- save AND quit- there is no other option lol! You have to quit out of the game to save...\nBut this has been mentioned in a lot of other peoples reviews, I'm pretty sure this will be fixed in the final build. so yeah, I'm giving it a positive review.

The game for me was well worth the $14.99 price tag as I'm sure I'm going to playing it much more in the future. The combat is a super fun aspect of the game, and keeps you on your toes while also making you feel badass, and the new evade move makes you use interresting tactics while in combat, however be aware it is early access so there are a lot of bugs currently. The menu UI tends to bug out a lot, either freezing for minutes, or just taking too long to load, so pausing the gameplay is a must when menu hopping, and during combat you can still be hit when paused which is very frustrating, and inconsistant sometimes the enemys fire when paused, sometimes they don't, the only consistand bug that happens every time is if an enemy fires a torpedo, even pausing does not stop it moving, you can use this to your advantage if you sheild it too early, because while the torpedo will still travel and hit you, the sheild will last infinitely while paused, but I would rather everything stop when I pause, because that is why I paused in the first place. The most annoying bug I have come accross however is when I finished it for the first time on normal difficulty the game crashed while loading the finale cutscene, so I went through all the effort for nothing, but this has only happened once in 15 hours of play, and is still the only game crash I have had currently. Despite all the issues, I would recomend the game, because honestly I have had a lot of fun playing, but if you can't get passed the bugs I mentioned, then I would avoid it.

It's fun, and it's going to get more fun. Buy it.\n\nIf you've got this far, however, I'll break down the bits I didn't like so much.\n\nYeah... it's a poor-man's FTL with better graphics. It has combat which looks prettier, but ultimately isn't quite so engaging.\n\nIn FTL, you are basically at each decision-point in moments. In ITS you have to point your ship in the right direction and wait a while.   Frantic it is not. Atmospheric, it is.\n\nOccasionally en-route you'll be told something is happening which needs attention, and you assign a crewmember to fix it. Essentially, this takes them out of the command pool, and you might find you wish you hadn't assigned your pilot to sanitary clean-up duty when all hell breaks loose.\n\nCombat is basically FTL without the fun weaponry and targeting.\nYour enemy charges a red, yellow or blue weapon... you make sure your shields match to limit damage.\nWhen firing your own weapons, make sure they're a different colour to the enemy shields.\nRinse and repeat.\n\nWhen you get to where you're supposed to be, the game basically whimpers to a halt and tells you how much you earned. No 'boss-fight' or challenge to face. It felt a bit flat, to be honest.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think FTL went too far in the other direction... but ITS had nothing.\n\nThe main way of getting resources is to mine planets. This feels a bit place-holder. You essentially move a little icon left and right to collect resources of different types. I would really love it if this was improved. Even if it's just a graphical overhaul. That way I don't sit there wondering if I've just paid NZ$17 for something out of the 1980s.\n\nShip customisation is basically limited to what resources your modules use. You can swap out your magnesium-guzzling engines for hydrogen engines, for example. They might go a little faster. Or not.\n\nI like it though. On the understanding that it's Early Access and that I haven't put a great many hours into it, it's comfortably diverting.  There are a few things I'd like to see improved though:\n\n1. Procedural universe.  At the moment, it isn't.\n2. More things to do. Or at-least, more than just dragging crew into "Fix It" slots.\n3. A better 'end-game'.\n4. More ship customisation.\n5. Mining. Fix mining. Please.\n6. More captains-chair engagement.  There's so much potential there for crew interaction.\n\nI have high hopes for this one, and - honestly - think it's probably worth taking the punt and putting some money into it. If it gets as good as FTL... and I think the potential is well and truly there... then it's going to be a winner.\n\nIt's playable and fun now - with the caveats above - but the potential here is for an amazing piece of kit, and I really am looking forward to it.","December 22, 2015","true","4.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I think that it might have some real potential but as it sits is very much not worth the money asked.  In fact I sorta think they sould be paying me to play.  Even with the best engines it is impossible to explore planets before the badguys catch you.  Combat is very difficult, not because it is complex, but because the controls are very clunky and unresponsive.  The GUI needs a lot of work as many tasks that should be very easy take a lot of effort and time, and in this game time matters a lot.  After two hours I just threw my hands up in frustration.  I might take another look once another patch comes out, but not before.\n\nThere is some good though.  As you are being chased by the Skorn you only have a limited ammount of time in any given zone.  So you have to be quick about getting to a planet and exploring/mining it.  If you wait around you will be attacked, and eventualy killed.  So there is some natural dramatic tension.  But I think they need to work on timing, either by allowing more time in a zone or auto freezing the timers when choosing who does what.","August 19, 2015","false","2.4"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","1"

There's no depth at all to this game - and that's really the worst part. If you just want to kill some brain cells for a few minutes, I guess it's not horrible. But be warned, the enemy NEVER misses - absolutely never, Yet you seem to have about a 50% hit rate. The best strategy seems to be "race straight to the end". Every enemy encounter is more ridculously outmatched than the last. There's no real progression that makes you any more cabaple of surviving battles. Any planetary mission with less than 70% success odds will most likely fail resulting in lost crew followed immediately by a skorn attack where you don't have enough crew to man battle stations. Don't bother doing anything but a couple of mining probes at each planet and then scurry off to the next to avoid the indomitable skorn.

A Patch with nothing of note, and truly no real changes from EA except perhaps a less frequent 'Nebraska Crash'. Still nothing delivered on the front of "We're looking into it!" for KS and EA adopters who've missed the content in the Deluxe Release. Nada.\nPoor show, chaps.\n\nEDIT: This review was written in EA with the anticipation of much more to come. Unfortunately it hasn't yet, and worse, EA and Kickstarter adopters have been rewarded with nothing. The price did not rise as the EA explanation page said it would, but worse a Deluxe Edition was co-released offering a much requested Star Chart as part of the DE. Caused some ill will,and then some. The resources being displayed for planets has been addressed now, though and is displyed as you approach a planet. Resources are now made visible, from the external view only though I'd still like that Star Map.\n\nThe roadmap of things to possibly come really needs addressing by the community to build this game to what it promised to be. There is still huge potential...\n\nThis game will die if the community does not once more become active and see the game grow. A free weekend and sale when the roadmap is being implemeneted might increase the population of the community and the ill will reflected in negative reviews might be vanquished as a result. So, while my review for EA stands as a positive, and my re-review negative, it is once more positive based soley on the Roadmap.I have to give the final release a thumbs down for now but will remain positive with the promise of things to come. We were all excited  prior to release, and this could be reclaimed once more....\n\nNot just up to the Devs, but us players to get involved with continued development. We've been invited, so let's come to the party.\n\nEA REVIEW: "Into The Stars" is an excellent EA title, particulalrly given so many EA missteps, giving the early access buyer a full-fledged experience of what will be in the final release. If you loved "Star Trek: Bridge Commander", a game I played again only recently, then you have an idea of what to expect. Unlike "ST:BC" though, you are in control of your ship with direct input (think "Independence War 2") and have a civilian population aboard, in a 'city' that you must feed, oxygenate and build support structures for.\nYou fly an Ark, searching for a new home with your civilian populace - ala "Battlestar Galactica".\n\nAt the heart is a "FTL"-like idea that you have to move from sector to sector (basically planet to planet) with an enemy in hot pursuit - the Skorn! Unlike "FTL" though it is both first and third person, in that you are either in 3rd Person with your ship at the centre, or in the Captain's chair navigating from planet to planet in order to send shuttles down on mission, manual drilling or automated resource probe gathering.\n\nThere are Shuttle Missions, Shuttle Drilling (for resources), and Probes. The shuttle missions consist of objectives, with choices on how to conduct them with items and modules as rewards if successful. The drilling assignments are a mini-game of sorts where you must direct your drill to collect as many resources as you can before running out of fuel or hitting a block. The automated probe resource gathering assignments consists of assigning a pilot and sending the probe down which if successful results in resources collected.\nCareful though, as each planet holds different resources and expending Nitrogen or Hydrogen to collect Biomass to feed the populace might have you running out of fuel and at the mercy of the Skorn. It is up to the player to choose how much of any gathered resource to bring aboard the ship, and this can take some juggling by the player/captain.\nYou will also interact with pirates and trading vessels, but so far the trades aren't particularly inspiring.\n\nIn the third person, you see your ship in all its glory and surrounding planetary bodies, nebulae, suns and asteroids all beautifully rendered using the Unreal 4 engine. It's also an efficient way of spotting Skorn ships, and planets safely in reach away from the enemy (which on your map each sector displays yellow threats and red - attack imminent).Speaking of which….\n\nBattles are handled well, as you micromanage and build the skills of your crew in training, populace alerts and through missions, and assign them to battle stations. You must modulate your shield and weapon frequencies to differ from your attackers, which is fairly simply down, and you have shields and a dodge ability (very useful). Target enemy modules by taking down shield, and then weapons as quickly as you can then attack the hull. You do take damage and casualties though, and this is where the items, such as repair items can be used to fix up the damage taken. Injured crew can be assigned to one of two sick bays to heal and if lost, additional crew members are offered as rewards for shuttle missions.\n\nWith much to come and a lot of polishing, according to the Devs this makes the anticipation for launch day high. Don't know if there will be modding tools or a workshop, but the game really would benefit if you could transform your ship into the "Enterprise", the Battlestar "Galactica" or even a Star Destroyer (let alone the Firefly or Normandy).\nHave to wait and see...","March 3","false","7.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","6"
