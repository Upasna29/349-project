I bought it because it was cheap so I wasn't expecting much, yet somehow it managed to fall short of my incredibly low expectations.\n\nFirstly, I couldn't figure out half of what I was clicking on because there are no tooltips or words on ANY of the menus. This means that you'll be blindly clicking until you make the game do something that vaguely resembles what you wanted to do.\n\nSecondly, the levels were poorly designed, some of them were falling apart before I even did anything and my catapult (if we're calling  it that) had all the power of a feather duster leading me to believe that some of the structures were collapsing out of pity.\n\nLastly, the game runs amazingly poorly, even on high end machines, with lag occuring between shots which is surprising considering the real angry birds can run well on a £50 tablet, let alone a £600+ Gaming PC.\n\nSo I'll be returning this game, because I feel cheated even though I spent 60p.\n","July 28, 2015","false","0.2"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","12","12","3","0"

My parents were fighting constantly, I had no friends, and everyone I met hated me because I was fat. I needed something to prevent me from suicide. I could not find anything I really liked. I tried buying toys, but the store clerks always prevented me from buying anything because I was overweight. I tried making a vlog on YouTube about my troubles, but I was banned from youtube for supposedly impersonating Gabriel Iglesias. Google fined me all of my money until I only had $1.10 left.\n\nThe only things I had were things necessary for my survival. I was fed a potato every other day and also given water in a shot glass. Sometimes I forced myself to use the water as a way to bath instead of drinking it. I was locked in my room every day cuz my parents were busy fighting about which console to play on. Well, not entirely.\n\nI had this netbook, one my parents got me for my birthday when I was 12. I used it for school, mostly, until now. I was also lucky enough to have a charger, and all the stuff you need to use the netbook. I decided, maybe give video games a try. No one would judge me there. I was unable to play the f2p games because A. They took too much storage and B. I would be banned whenever I joined a multiplayer game. I remembered the $1.10 I had left.\n\nI knew I had to find something that gave me a reason to live. I looked through the steam store. Jesus almost nothing was $1.10! I was about to give up and just end my life when I found this game. Robot vs Birds Zombies. 99 cents, without 10% tax. It took up all the space on my netbook. After waiting for it to download, I opened up the game. Upon opening it up there was a well made launcher with many options. Once I opened up the actual game, I heard a sweet rock song, and saw some badass looking birds and a cool robot. Was this what I needed to continue living\n\nIt was. I am proud to say Robot vs Birds Zombies saved my life. The characters were deep, had personality, and I was able to connect with them. The story was unique, suspenseful, and I shed multiple tears. The graphics were revolutionary, and the soundtrack was the first good thing I had heard in awhile. It, in a way, provided everything I needed to live. The characters were my friends. The game was like a good parent. The game was easy to fap to. I could have just played the game for my entire life. It was amazing. It changed me. Here I am, sitting in my room, now infested with bullet ants and bees, starved half to death and with my throat about to dry up. But you know what? I do not care. Because I have Robot vs Birds Zumbies. And I will always have Robot vs Birds Zumbies. This game is my life now. I am finally happy. I am finally free. I know now the meaning of life. And only because yfyx games spent their time on this godly game.\n\n\nits ♥♥♥♥.","August 10, 2015","true","0.2"," 62 of 114 people (54%) found this review helpful 117 people found this review funny","54","62","114","117","6"

My parents were fighting constantly, I had no friends, and everyone I met hated me because I was fat. I needed something to prevent me from suicide. I could not find anything I really liked. I tried buying toys, but the store clerks always prevented me from buying anything because I was overweight. I tried making a vlog on YouTube about my troubles, but I was banned from youtube for supposedly impersonating Gabriel Iglesias. Google fined me all of my money until I only had $1.10 left.\n\nThe only things I had were things necessary for my survival. I was fed a potato every other day and also given water in a shot glass. Sometimes I forced myself to use the water as a way to bath instead of drinking it. I was locked in my room every day cuz my parents were busy fighting about which console to play on. Well, not entirely.\n\nI had this netbook, one my parents got me for my birthday when I was 12. I used it for school, mostly, until now. I was also lucky enough to have a charger, and all the stuff you need to use the netbook. I decided, maybe give video games a try. No one would judge me there. I was unable to play the f2p games because A. They took too much storage and B. I would be banned whenever I joined a multiplayer game. I remembered the $1.10 I had left.\n\nI knew I had to find something that gave me a reason to live. I looked through the steam store. Jesus almost nothing was $1.10! I was about to give up and just end my life when I found this game. Robot vs Birds Zombies. 99 cents, without 10% tax. It took up all the space on my netbook. After waiting for it to download, I opened up the game. Upon opening it up there was a well made launcher with many options. Once I opened up the actual game, I heard a sweet rock song, and saw some badass looking birds and a cool robot. Was this what I needed to continue living\n\nIt was. I am proud to say Robot vs Birds Zombies saved my life. The characters were deep, had personality, and I was able to connect with them. The story was unique, suspenseful, and I shed multiple tears. The graphics were revolutionary, and the soundtrack was the first good thing I had heard in awhile. It, in a way, provided everything I needed to live. The characters were my friends. The game was like a good parent. The game was easy to fap to. I could have just played the game for my entire life. It was amazing. It changed me. Here I am, sitting in my room, now infested with bullet ants and bees, starved half to death and with my throat about to dry up. But you know what? I do not care. Because I have Robot vs Birds Zumbies. And I will always have Robot vs Birds Zumbies. This game is my life now. I am finally happy. I am finally free. I know now the meaning of life. And only because yfyx games spent their time on this godly game.\n\n\nits ♥♥♥♥.","August 10, 2015","true","0.2"," 62 of 114 people (54%) found this review helpful 117 people found this review funny","54","62","114","117","6"

Cheap rip off of Angry Birds but a good way to waste time.  If you have the money to waste (which unless you still live mommy you should) then try it out.  If not save that dollar and get a soda, becuase those taste much better than this plays.","August 19, 2015","false","0.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
