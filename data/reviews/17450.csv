The other 8 expansions for this game can't be purchased through steam, but rather through Bioware points.

I play 'em once, and I'm done. That's all that I need to do. On occasion, if a game is really good, I'll go back to it once or twice. Maybe. What I don't do--what I absolutely do not DO... is put two hundred and eighteen hours into a game, which at present, is exactly what I've done with Dragon Age: Origins.\n\nIt is, suffice it to say, very much an exception to the rule, and I can't entirely be sure why. The plot's bog-standard fantasy fare (and worse, it requires that you be friendly to elves, who are the single worst race that has ever (not) existed, and every single one of them deserve to die; I think you and I can both agree that elves are, in fact, lazy scumbags who probably eat babies; I am highly offended at having to play a game as if I am, in fact, a friend of elves, because everyone knows they're horrible people responsible for all the world's problems, with their high and mighty 'we were so immortal and cool and awesome and amazing and perfect but you puny humans destroyed us' well you know what, you punks? if we destroyed you, maybe you just sucked; or, hey, maybe you just pretended you were awesome because you REALLY just live in wagons rolling around the prairies being terrible at everything you DO!)\n\nwhere was I?\n\nRight. The plot's not that great. The gameplay, well, it could be better, I suppose. The Fade is so bad, that people have modded it out, and Orzammar, once you head out of the city and into the caves beyond, is just awful.\n\n...and yet I've beat it three times, played through the expansion, bought all the DLC religiously, and, despite all clear warning signs to the contrary, purchased a copy of Dragon Age II, which ended up being worse than a good number of people said. But its lack of quality is fairly self-evident--it's been said that retail chains refused to stock a GOTY edition after EA approached them.\n\nSo why do I love Dragon Age?\n\nI dunno. It's certainly not because I'm a Baldur's Gate fan, as some have suggested, because I've never played Baldur's Gate before. It's not because of Morrigan, who, up until Fenris, was the most anime (and not in a good way) character the series had.\n\nYou might notice I'm bashing this game an awful lot, and I don't really mean to. The truth is that I just don't know why I love this game as much as I do. I have fun with it. I think the systems are deep. I've set up my team tactics so well that one time, when I forgot to pause, I left, and returned to find a boss dead. I've beaten the game twice as a rogue (when it comes to Bioware games, the hardest difficulty is Rogue + Hardest Difficulty, always), and experimented with other classes; what's fascinating is how differently both of my rogue playthroughs were. In one game, I was a melee archer. In another, I was a backstabber with grenades. I've discovered that the game isn't particularly fun if you roll mage--best to keep just one mage in your party, otherwise it kinda sucks.\n\nI love the characters who aren't Morrigan or Zevran. No one is exactly what they appear to be when you first meet them, except for Dog, who is exactly what you would expect from a Dog who loves you unconditionally; this is a game that benefits tremendously from the player actually trying to role-play. Leliana isn't just a puritanical priestess. Wynne looooves alcohol. Oghren isn't just a boozer, he's a man/dwarf with a broken heart. Sten loves cookies and wants to go on adventures with you, which you'd never guess if you were intolerant of weird religions.\n\nSo it seems weird to say that the actual combat isn't super compelling, the plot itself is rather boring and just another Bioware plot, so it's nothing special or good. Plus and the main acts of the game are boring--the mage's tower's time spent in the Fade, EVERY SINGLE SECOND spent helping elves out, and the awful writing in Orzammar.\n\nAnd yet I've put two hundred and eighteen hours into it, I'd willingly play through it again, and I know I'd have fun doing it.\n\nI just can't tell you exactly why that is.","November 26, 2013","true","218.2"," 957 of 1,171 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","957","1","3","41"

Enchantment!\nDescribed as the spiritual successor to Baldur's Gate by former Bioware CEO Ray Muzyka, Dragon Age: Origins was easily one of the most hotly anticipated releases of the 2009 Christmas calendar. Party-based role playing games, which where immensely popular in the late nineties and early two thousands, had long since fallen out of favor with most big publishing houses thanks to the rise and popularity of the home console. With their lengthy novella like texts and lethargic combat mechanics (often involving a lot of pausing, lining up of abilities and buffs and strategic character placements on the battlefield) they were simply no longer du jour. PC piracy at the time also played a large contributing factor towards why most PC-centric development houses were jumping ship and abandoning the PC, so to the many fans of this genre of RPG we simply had to contend with the fact that party-based role playing games were, in all probability, dead in the water since they are often incredibly difficult games to replicate, without making the game an entirely cumbersome affair, on a home console, without the use of a mouse and a keyboard.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=400232207\nSadly the success of Dragon Age: Origins on the PC did not herald a second coming as the subsequent sequels in the franchise devolved into a more action-orientated affair. It would be another four years before we saw the genre gain popularity once again thanks to independent studios using crowd-funding and early access to breath life back into the genre (Obsidian's and InXile's Kickstarted Pillars of Eternity, Wasteland 2 and upcoming Torment: Tides of Numenera to Larian Studios early access title Divinity: Original Sin). Dragon Age: Origins is a great entry point for those unfamiliar with the genre or find the older classics upon which the game takes many of its ques (Baldur's Gate 1 and 2) a little too harsh on the eye or feel that they are a tad too outdated for the modern era. Once again Bioware shows its usual flair when it comes to world building which are often filled to the brim with a detailed narrative, fully fleshed out characters and an engrossing lore to anchor the world and give it a presence. Being a modern game with a far bigger budget all narrative is now fully voiced and accompanied by impressive cut scenes which drive the story forward removing one of the barriers to the genre - the tome like texts that were often used to drive the narrative forward.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=385314955\nWhere Dragon Age: Origins succeeds admirably though is through the origin tale it tells of the hero you select at the start of the game. There are a host of options to choose from depending which route you plan to cover at the start (mage, human, dwarf or elf) with each race getting its very own opening chapter which fleshes out the lore of each race wonderfully before dovetailing comfortably into the games main plot which sees your hero being recruited by the head of the Grey Wardens, a fabled group of warriors who must unite the Kingdom of Ferelden before an impending demon invasion know as blight tears the kingdom asunder. As with most party-based role playing games the canvas upon which Dragon Age: Origins etches its tale is broad and sweeping and filled with a host of memorable characters (although it is no where near as large a game as the classics of yore). As the tale progresses the player will eventually form a party of four from a host of characters that you, the leader, can recruit on your travels. You will always have access to them in your party even as the roster grows, each coming with their own strengths and weaknesses so it will be up to you to play mix and match until you have found a formula that suits you best. Like your main character you will also have a hand in dealing how each character develops over the course of the stories arc which adds nicely to the replay value should you consider to go another round after the main campaign is completed. While the party mechanic is filled with a host of well rounded characters my only gripe here is that you will need to micro manage your party right down to who gets to take a ♥♥♥♥ first because on any difficulty level above easy characters sometimes have a hard time obeying the commands you just gave them and even if you use the tactical slots given to you, which are unlocked the further you progress, they still often go off on a tangent and have to be quickly brought back into line lest the party forfeit the battle.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=385057627\nIf you own the Ultimate Edition - all DLC previously offered as in game purchases through the game client is included. Each DLC is its own self contained adventure that lasts roughly 2-4 hrs depending on your playstyle. None of the DLC is unfortunately up to the same level of excellence as the main campaign but completing either of them does include some valuable gear and equipment that can be used in the main game or carried over into Dragon Age: Awakenings - the full expansion pack that accompanies the Dragon Age: Origins Ultimate Edition. Graphically, Dragon Age: Origins has aged particularly well. It was never a looker to begin with but 6 years on from release they are still serviceable if a little brown, muddy and drab. Developed using the Lycium engine, this engine was eventually put out to pasture and replaced with the Frostbite engine for Dragon Age Inquisition. The game is also served by a fully orchestrated soundtrack which is hits just the right amount of epic during key moments of the adventure.\n\nThere really isn't much to fault with Biowares return to dark, gritty heroic fantasy. It is a real throwback to the good old days of RPG gaming and it enthralls and entertains at every turn and it is certainly in my top favorite RPG games of all time so I have no qualms recommending it as an essential purchase for all RPG lovers the world over. If you haven't given the game a spin yet or don't own it in your library I highly recommend you purchase it during the sale or give it a spin soonest. You won't be disappointed.\n\nIf you enjoyed reading this review please follow my curator group at:-\nCurator Rater","June 14, 2015","true","125.6"," 146 of 164 people (89%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","89","146","164","7","11"

First of all, this game surpassed my opinion highly on Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion, and I adored that game. I believe that I got this game on sale, but I would gladly buy it again, full price, if I had the money. Second of all, my mom plays this game on my laptop instead of on the Xbox, which is nice, because she hadn't touched the game in a long time. When she saw that I had this game, she asked to play and has now raised my time on the game up to 66 hours.\n\nThe greatest parts of it, in my opinion, is the freedom to choose. Of course, the story-line is always the same, but there are minor differences that still change the ending, at least a little bit. Other great parts of this game include loveable characters, balanced gameplay, and moderately difficult combat.\n\nOne bad part that my dad complains about is the amount of talking in this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/andyw_uk/recommended/17450/","andyw_uk","AndyW_UK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/andyw_uk/","160 products in account","First, let's make one thing clear - I am the RPG Master. I suck at FPS, am mediocre at strategy games (at best), but when it comes to absorbing lore, story and fantasy world setting, I know what I'm doing.\n\nDragon Age: Origins is a game that tries to recapture the immersion and style of the legendary PC RPGs of yore, such as Baldur's Gate and Planescape: Torment; and it succeeds...somewhat. I have mixed feelings about this game.\n\nFirst, the world and setting - the delivery is dark and beautiful. Most of the art and level design is fantastic, and the atmosphere is just great (including the sound assets and music). Some of the concepts explored, especially religion, is (mostly) maturely handled and gives the game a dark, gritty feel where choices matter and not everything has a fairytale ending. On the other hand, Dragon Age, as a new IP, gave BioWare the chance to move away from the tired old Tolkienen mythos with its elves, dwarves and orcs (Darkspawn). Dragon Age sadly did not grasp this opportunity, instead opting for the safe approach of classic fantasy RPG cliches. Just like every other franchise of Tolkienen origin, humans are common and varied, Elves are few in number and mistrusted, and Dwarves are selfish and suspicious underground-dwellers.\n\nDespite this, Dragon Age has some outstandingly written and delivered characters (albeit one or two iffy ones as well), and the fact I can remember who they are in 2014 after buying this game in 2009 speaks volumes of the effort that went into creating them and fleshing them out. There's some great dialogue and banter between all the party members and the Warden, and occasionally with each other, some of which is truly memorable.\n\nThe main storyline, on the other hand, was a disappointment. The greatest RPGs build their plot around a link between a protagonist and antagonist, and support that link with supporting characters and a series of events that affect and change those characters. This is what made RPGs like the Baldur's Gate series, Planescape: Torment, and the PSX-era Final Fantasies so great. Dragon Age's main villain? Some sort of dragon/demon hybrid with minimal back-story (something about corrupted Tevinter gods based on an in-game myth and...nope, that's all there really is). Number of great villainous speeches and dialogues: zero. Reasoning behind bringing thousands of Darkspawn to the surface in the form of the Blight? No, I don't know either. All we get is some wishy-washy concept of the Warden being linked to the Archdemon by drinking Darkspawn blood.\n\nThere are so many things I wanted to know about the world of DA:O that could've been revealed through gameplay and/or dialogue - are the archdemons really corrupted Tevinter gods? Does Urthemiel (the archdemon) retain any semblance of true intelligence or decision-making capability? What was he/she like in the way of godly aspect or personality? Who is the Maker? Is the story of Tevinter and the Golden City true? What is the true origin of the Darkspawn? All these things remain unaswered, at most hinted at in codex lore that many players will not even read.\n\nLoghain, on the other hand, was a character who deserved more screen-time and had a lot more potential as an antagonist. Unfortunately, despite his apparent intellect, he came across as too narrow-minded to be truly threatening or powerful, so again this was a story opportunity wasted. Overall, the story of Dragon Age: Origins spends too much time meandering about overly-long dungeons, collecting allies and items in what amounts to a series of fetch quests with the occasional bit of good dialogue. This part of the game should not have taken 50 hours and taken up most of the game's length, which demonstrates a lack of pacing in the storytelling. There's very little in the way of personal development for the Warden, such as discovering and unlocking your abilities as a Bhaalspawn in the Baldur's Gate series. When you're not dungeoneering or playing politics, you're doing tedious sidequests with insipid rewards like some errand boy - if you want sidequests or distractions, where are the optional superbosses, or high-end dungeons where challenging creatures and the most powerful weapons in the game are found? Lengthy but relevant sidequests that tie into the main storyline and/or character, like Firkraag in BG2? Not here, unfortunately.\n\nAll things considered, I've attacked Dragon Age: Origins pretty hard so far, so why am I still recommending it? Well, the game's mechanics are good, combat is visceral and satisfying, a lot of the character dialogue is really good, and the design of the world and locations, and the immersion they provide are excellent. You will lose yourself in this adventure for many, many hours and for that it's worth playing, especially if you can pick it up on sale. It's just a shame the core story had such a lack of nuance, and left me with so many unanswered questions.","January 24, 2014","true","272.6"," 106 of 120 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","106","120","0","1"

It is OK. don't be deceived by the 465 hours on record, most of those playthroughs were outside Steam.  Definitely do NOT buy the standard edition, but hang out for the 'Ultimate Edition' because there is LOTS of DLC and you want it all. Dragon Age Origins is something of an enigma. It is a great RPG that brought together most of the good things that Bioware had achieved with Baldur's Gate and the Neverwinter Nights games, but it falls just short of perfecting them. All the content is superb except for the absence of an explorable world, (something Bioware has never even tried to achieve). Sadly the series turned South after this. Edmonton seems obsessed with the idea that video games need to be interactive movies where players marvel at the studio's voice acting talent and cinematic cut scenes. They forgot along the way that role-playing is about the players creating their own stories. In time all of the once numerous class and race options that players had enjoyed with the AD&D based system disappeared, along with any real moral or narrative choices. Dragon Age Origins was the last Hurrah for the old-style feel. I would say that every RPG fan NEEDS to own and play the Ultimate edition of Origins. Enjoy all that is good in it. Also observe the key ways in which it fails. Origins is a great case study in RPG design.","November 30, 2015","true","488.1"," 96 of 107 people (90%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","90","96","107","6","1"

The tougher fights allowed to good decision making on how to make proper use of your party and their skills to combine magical abilities and skills to keep your party alive and victorious.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nabbed/recommended/17450/","nabbed","kk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nabbed/","53 products in account","Dragon Age is a kind of game that is becoming increasingly rare: a deeply immersive single-player RPG with an interface clearly designed for the PC. It's easy to sling around the word "immersive" at any game that looks pretty, but DA isn't messing around - the world of Ferelden shows a unified sense of design and depth that blows even famously vast games like Oblivion out of the water. Coupled with consistently excellent writing and across-the-board quality character design even down to relatively unimportant NPCs, the game truly does feel like it's reacting to your choices dynamically from the very beginning, and how you play your character can have amazingly subtle effects on the way the story unfolds.\n\nGraphically, the game's a little uneven. All the design elements are there, and it has plenty of high-quality textures and strong environmental visuals - particularly fire effects. The polygons themselves, particularly on character faces, are a little simpler than you'd expect from a 2009 game. Overall, the game looks about on level with Oblivion, although the visual distinctiveness and design ethic of areas and characters are significantly better. Animation stands out as a strong suit here, particularly during the game's frequent dialog sequences, with none of the dead-eyed staring or bizarre walk cycles that plagued other RPGs like Fallout 3.\n\nGameplay is pretty straightforward, and very much in keeping with previous Bioware titles like Knights of the Old Republic and Mass Effect. You control a party of up to four characters, each of whom develops a plethora of useful abilities to keep track of. The inclusion of a minor programming element (very much in keeping with the gambit system from Final Fantasy XII) will let you set up a few default actions on each character so you're not stuck frantically switching between them to make sure they drink their healing potions, but battles frequently require some degree of tactical planning. Setting up ambushes and planning your party strategy to play to strengths is necessary to get through some tougher areas. The interface is, shockingly, clearly tailor-made for the PC (the console versions have their own interfaces designed from the bottom up and are apparently easier games to allow for the sacrifice in easy access to skills). You have an insane number of quick-access slots, and nearly the entire keyboard is bound to one thing or another. It's the kind of interface that hasn't been in vogue since before the PS2 came out. The game is extremely linear, although the frequent and varied dialog options give it the feel of a more free-roaming game, and it's very tempting to go back and replay huge chunks of the game just to see how the complex and dynamic conversations will play out. The main downside is that there's no easy way to level-grind, which is to the game's benefit to a point (no tedious circling around killing wolves) but occasionally means you can get in over your head.\n\nWhat the game sacrifices in terms of sandbox free-roaming it more than makes up with in the excellent writing and characterization. An absurd attention to detail and across-the-board excellent voice acting breathes a lot of life into the game's conversations, which make up a significant chunk of gameplay. Characters are extremely varied and the interplay between them is a major draw, a trademark of Bioware's games, but Dragon Age has some of the most likable characters I've ever seen in a video game and the excellent performances from talents like Tim Curry, Kate Mulgrew and Claudia Black really put the game a notch above. Even the game's fairly generic-on-the-surface fantasy world is livened up by a few critical details - for example, the elves in Dragon Age are a massive underclass of servants.\n\nIt's actually difficult to find things to level complaints against in this game. One petty gripe is Morrigan's visual design - her character is one of the game's strongest, and she has great personality and some very clever writing, but visually she's a pair of giant breasts with a cloth draped improbably over them. Other women in the game are treated with a bit more restraint, though, and female armor is gratifyingly sensible. Another issue is that it can be difficult to manage battles on the fly, and accurately targeting enemies with skills frequently requires tactical pausing just to line the cursor up over their relatively small active areas. It's a petty annoyance, but the game clearly wasn't meant to be played Diablo-style anyway.\n\nA few other things to know about the game:\n-The game is mostly DRM-free, and ships only with a simple disc check. EA has a reputation for fouling up its customers' computers with DRM malware, but DA seems to be free of those problems.\n-If Dragon Age were a movie, it would be rated R. I don't remember ever seeing any swearing, oddly, but the game is rife with violent imagery, extremely dark themes and frank sexuality (including a handful of relatively tasteful sex scenes and occasional demonic nudity). The game handles all of it with maturity and depth, but it's clearly not meant for children, and even parents of younger teens should be cautious.\n\nOverall, Dragon Age is one of the strongest games to come out in recent memory, and is another installment in Bioware's increasing resume of superbly-written RPGs. Players looking for a fast-paced hack-and-slash "rpg" should look elsewhere, but anyone who likes deep and elegant plot development, memorable characters and excellent role-playing will love this game.","November 11, 2015","true","463.0"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","86","37","43","3","0"

From race, gender, background story, classes, and more.\n\nAnd then there's the main component of the game: the gameplay is fun, diverse and challenging, the world is mythical and really gives you an epic feeling, and by the end of the game you'll be left off with a feeling that you need to replay it and try everything you hadn't tried out before. You'll want to try out being evil or good, generous or selfish, kind or rude, it's all up to you. The choices you make impact certain events of the game, and the choices you make can have dire consequences as well. So choose wisely who to side with, and consider your options.\n\nThe negative aspect of the game, though, is that it can be pretty linear, and some areas are reused.

The same goes if you regard games like Planescape: Torment, Fallout 2 and the Baldurs Gate-series among the best computer games ever made. Because this game is everything a person like you look for in a game, and so much more. Be aware though, Dragon Age: Origins is not a revolution of the genre, rather it is an evolution, where Bioware has refined everything that made them into a formula as close to perfection as possible.A spectacular experience from beginning to end, and with an enormous amount of choices to make, cities to visit, dungeons to crawl, NPCs to interact with, treasure to find, quests to complete and crafts to master, I feel pretty confident in saying that Dragon Age: Origins is, without a doubt, one of the most enjoyable and immersive RPG experiences I've had.Incredible storytelling, great characters, and exciting battles are just a few of the things that make this fantasy role-playing game so extraordinary.Dragon Age: Origins might have a few clichés here and there, but for those looking for a RPG to lose themselves in, you need not look any further.This is the most enormously detailed game world I've experienced, its history stretching back thousands of years, its cultures vivid, beautiful and flawed, the battles enormous, the humour superb.

It built on the successes of earlier RPGs such as baldur's gate and neverwinter and really decided to make a gmae world worth exploring.\n\nI've been playing the game every so often since 2009 and there are certain aspects of the game that don't hold up, like excessive pop-in texturing, long (and progressively longer loading times with larger save files) loading times even on PC, which is a sad, sad thing.  When one has a hybrid-SSD, a game should not take 5-10 minutes to load an action sequence.  Which leads me to believe it is a memory leak, or a fault in the programming, as this generally seems to follow a set pattern.  The length of the load-time increases in proportion with two variables.  The first variable is how long you have been playing the current character, and the second variable is how long you've been playing in the current session.\n\nAlso, random encounters are a crappy thing to do to a player.  Just look at every JRPG.  Did anyone think that was a good idea?   And...some of the animations are cheesy and overdone.\n\nOkay, I got all the bad stuff out of the way first.  Everything else is completely masterful.  The art direction, music, combat/tactics, and story progression are legendary.  I have yet to find a game that has this massive of a scope and yet allows consequential decisions by the player-character/warden.\n\nEven in 2009 I thought the Origins were an awesome addition, even if they didn't altogether seem to change the overall outcome of the game.  They were subtle and yet informative.  They helped shape a person's backstory, and also changed the way NPCs refer to you throughout the game.  I played as Dwarf Noble, Dwarf Castleless, Human Noble, City Elf, and Mage.  The only one I've yet to do is Dalish Elf.   I can't wait for inquisition to come out, since i have a Dwarf Female Castless rogue (warden plus warden commander and all dlc) imported to DA2, and ready to go for DA:I.\n\nMass Effect capitalized on the meaningful companions and meaningful choices formula, but DA:O took it to a new level (minus the whole gifts charade).  Each companion you pick up (and many of them aren't even required) are unique and interesting.  They interact with each other and with the world around them.  They respond believably to the events that your Warden gets into, and are all worthwhile investments of your time.  Get to know them.  Even Morrigan, and especially Alistair and Leliana.  They're all wonderful people that feel real.\n\nIn the end, though, what keeps me coming back to the game is that there aren't any other games out there like it.  There are some that have tried, but oh how they've failed.  I'm looking at you, Kingdoms of Amalur.  Even DA2 couldn't compete with its predecessor in terms of replayability and meaningful consequences.\n\nIt would be exceeedingly rare for two separate gamers to have two Wardens that made all the same choices.  I'd say the odds would be somewhere in the hundreds of millions to one.  There are hundreds of small choices, and quite a few large ones that not only affect the ending, but leak over into the DLC and Awakening (and somewhat into DA2).  This is what makes this game a masterpiece.  It singlehandedly makes you forget your life and brings you into the fold of Ferelden, Amaranthine, and Thedas itself.  Only the Bethesda games can claim to have as large a scope, but DA:O will always win in excecution in my book.","October 23, 2014","true","117.4"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Getting it all ingame through bioware point microransactions costs far more.\n\nDragon Age: Origins is easily one of the best games I have ever played. No other game has made me actually care about the characters on such a massive degree as this game has. Combine the world class Bioware writing and worlds with a pretty good but not perfect combat system and you have truly an epic adventure to behold. The world itself isn't really open world but that doesn't stop the land of Ferelden from being an interesting realm to explore. Graphically the game is quite dated now and lip syncing/animations are at times awkward (oh god the sex scenes ._.) but there is a very large mod database for improving visuals and despite looking old the game is still very much playable. (Also I'm pretty sure anything can run this game in this day and age)\n\nHaving many important choices actually matter and have a huge impact on the story makes this game incredibly replayable and a wetdream for roleplayers. In many situations you can be the good samaritan or evil incarnate. This leads to a level of immersion  rivaling that of other high fantasy rpgs such as the Elder Scrolls games. Everything from the various dialogue/party banter for the smallest of details to your companions actually having opinions on every choice you make really sells Dragon Age: Origins as a living breathing believable world which you can get lost in for hours on end.\n\nThe combat is very traditional dnd/baldurs gate style combat which some people who favor tactical combat with many pauses will enjoy and those who enjoy something like traditional hack n slash may not. Also the game starts off very slow so you have been warned. It picks up a few hours in when your party actually has a variety of skills.\n\nMy playtime (5% being me alt tabbed out) is for a single playthrough so there is definitely a ton of content in this game.","November 14, 2015","true","84.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

Dragon Age Origins brings us to the kingdom of Ferelden, caught in an epic battle against the Darkspawn horde, led by an Archdemon. I can't say much more without giving away the story, though I will say get ready for intrigue, mysteries, betrayal, redemption, and more as you join forces with Wandering and Mysterious strangers, Brothers and Sisters in Arms, and people you help along the way. Dragon Age Origins has just the right blend of RPG elements, and plot driven story line, to make it fun and interesting without letting you get to sidetracked. If you have any interest in the series at all, you must start with Origins. There are several DLC packs available for DA: Origins, which further the main story, provide backstory and history, as well as introduce new companions. Playing with all available DLC is recommended for the full experience. Having played DA: Origins, as well as DA 2 on the PS3, I look forward to reliving those experiences on the steam version of DA: Origins. It is that good!","June 1, 2015","true","1.4"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/brutaljones/recommended/17450/","brutaljones","Brutal Jones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/brutaljones/","178 products in account","(Note: I originally wrote this review on November 4, 2009 for a publication and focused on both the console and PC versions. I just updated it five years later in November, 2014 in order to update some of the references and make it more palatable for a gamer considering the title in the modern day.)\n\nMost of the gamers that are going to purchase Dragon Age: Origins know exactly what they're getting into. They're likely to be either old school PC gamers with love for the Baldur's Gate series or a younger, fresher class of gamers that have enjoyed BioWare's more recent Mass Effect series. I'll preface this review by letting you know right now that if you fall into one of these two categories and for some reason haven't yet purchase this game, you need to buy it immediately, because you will be hopelessly enthralled by it. You don't even need to read the rest of this review. Just go get it. For those not familiar with any of BioWare's other games, or those who have played only more recent RPGs and enjoyed them, read on.\n\nDragon Age: Origins' most important strengths are the story, ambiance, and characters. Lead writer David Gaider came from a job in hospitality services to begin writing for Dragon Age years ago, but his lack of proper experience certainly hasn't hampered him in the slightest. He's brilliant. The world building is a particular strength; it's amazing, and the art team supports Gaider and his team's writing very well. Every structure has an apparent age to it, and everything feels well-worn. It doesn't just look like the structures and settings have a history behind them, it feels like it, and the game certainly helps out the feeling by providing a detailed history codex providing further detail on everything you encounter in the game. We're talking about a Tolkien-esque level of effort put into developing the lore behind this game. I was shocked to learn that I hadn't even seen combat yet in nearly two hours of playing the game simply because I was so engulfed in reading every entry provided to me in the game's encyclopedia. For gamers like me who enjoy this sort of thing, it's fantastic. If you ever feel bogged down by the constant codex entry notifications, don't worry, because you're free to go about your way without ever delving too deep into the historical aspects of the world, and the game doesn't at all punish you for neglecting it. Nearly anything you need to know by means of storyline will come up in conversation anyway. A realistic, living world is always nice, but the true value of this lies in how many different ways your choices actually affect this world. There's no good and evil meter to gamify and cheapen them, and your choices all affect the land of Ferelden in a very real way.\n\nAnother strength of the game is the richness of the characters. The nuances of your main character will be more or less shaped by you, and while that's a good thing, I would've liked to have heard spoken dialogue for my character rather than have him go the silent protagonist route. I thought BioWare did a fantastic job with how they allowed a healthy mix between player construction and static, unchangeable attributes regarding Shepard in Mass Effect. I wish they would have steered the main character of Dragon Age more toward that end of the spectrum. Aside from that gripe, the rest of the cast of characters are simply fantastic. All have deep, fully realized personalities and feel as genuine as a character from a great novel. There are no Vaans or Penelos in this game. Each character has their quirks, their strengths, and their weaknesses. The characters are so lifelike that you'll end up legitimately liking or disliking them after only a few conversations, and that's one of the real strengths of Dragon Age. It's all due to the fantastic writing done by Gaider and his team.\n\nThe gameplay is almost what you'd expect from a classic CRPG. It's very much like Baldur's Gate, Planescape: Torment, KOTOR, etc. If you're familiar with the combat in those games then you'll be able to step in to Dragon Age and feel right at home. If not, then you'll need to make a bit of an adjustment to this style of game. You can pause and micromanage, queueing up actions for your various party members if you wish, or you can set the AI to do what you'd like it to and let your party run on autopilot without pausing the action at all. At lower difficulties the game doesn't punish you for playing either way, though once I pumped up the difficulty I found it almost a necessity to utilize the pause-and-play micromanagement style. The way you choose to play will depend strictly on what type of gamer you are.\n\nMake no mistake, this game was meant to be played on a PC. The graphics are absolutely atrocious while playing on a console, and it's obvious that the devs designed for a PC and then ported to the consoles -- A stark and unfortunate contrast to most titles nowadays. The graphical level of the XBOX 360 version of Dragon Age is equivalent to those of the first Mass Effect's now infamous pre-texture pop-ins. There is surprisingly little detail in the texture, and framerate has a terrible tendency to grind to a choppy halt at random intervals -- even when there isn't all that much going on onscreen. This, sadly, looks very much like a game that belongs back in 2005 or so. The PC, however, is very different, with much nicer textures and environments. The use of a hotbar and the tactical overhead view on the PC also favors that platform. The radial menus on the consoles are decent enough once you get used to them, but the hotbar is infinitely more effective, flows more continuously, and is far more comfortable to use. When you consider the amount of user-generated content available for this game in the form of mods, it's really no comparison. Rejoice, PCMR: This is a game created primarily for old-school, hardcore PC gamers.\n\nThere is, however, an issue to be had with the bugs present in the retail version of this game. Several times your character will get stuck on a bump or smooth rock on the ground, causing them to run in place continuously until you move them away manually. There's also an issue with your controlled character not responding to an attack command. Little things like this take away from the experience of an otherwise quality game, which is unfortunate, but now easily correctable with bug fix mods.\n\nIf you're a fan of BioWare's previous titles or old school CRPGs in general, this game has a very good chance of becoming an instant favorite of yours. It's not for everybody, though. Those who find RPGs to be a bit too slowly paced or plot heavy for their liking will probably be instantly turned away from this game. But if you can look past the faults of the game, there's a wonderful experience to be had with this title, and I'm sure I won't be done playing this for a long, long time.\n\nIn conclusion, this is a love letter to old school CRPGs like Planescape: Torment, Baldur's Gate II, and the like. If you liked those games, you'll absolutely love this one. If you're an RPG fan in general, it's absolutely worth a purchase, as the story, world building, and characterization is second to none. You'll just have to get used to the overhead, tactical style of gameplay.","July 21, 2012","true","162.0"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Go for the Ultimate Edition instead. The price at the moment is pretty much the same and it includes The Awakening expansion aswell as all of the DLCs. Steam doesn't include the option to buy DLCs for the basic version. The only way to get them would be using BioWare points in-game which is a big waste of money.\n\n/IMPORTANT\nThis game is my second favourite RPG right after The Witcher series. Somehow I've got into it that much I have to play it at least once a year. The hours might be quite low for few play throughs due to playing the game on Origin (with dlc's etc. and polish version which for me doesn't fit and ruins the gameplay, sadly).\n\nDragon Age has an awesome and interesting story, a big nature diversity of your companions, pretty cool combat style and quite good graphics as for a game from 2009. The story is well made, starting from the different beginnings for each race/class, lots of side-quests (which you might miss playing the first time), few discords between you and your companions and so on. As for the combat, it might be quite slowpaced and boring at the beginning for some due to it's tactical type (not a hack'n'slash one) but after gaining more skills you will find it more interesting and entertaining. The graphics might not be as good as the current games have but honestly, who gives a damn about the graphics?\n\nThe only thing that has been bothering me was the lack of main character's voice during the dialogues. It's basically mute. You will get to hear it only in the middle of the fights and that's (as far as I remember) all. The reason of such doing might be that it was expensive to do the voice sets for each class, type of voice and gender.\n\nIt has mods, too! Well, probably not as much as Skyrim with its' trains instead of dragons or animated fart shouts but hey! If you're looking for some check out nexusmods[nexusmods.com].\n\nFew mods that I've been using and you might find useful:\n- no helmet[www.nexusmods.com] - not really an issue, it's just that the visuals sometimes didn't fit and it looked ridiculous on few characters\n- extra dog slot[www.nexusmods.com] - the Mabari becomes your summon, instead of taking up the character slot\n- character respecialization[www.nexusmods.com] - whenever you want to change the default skills that have been given or try different builds you can drink the mysterious potion from a raven\n- a year with sten[www.nexusmods.com] - different model for one of your companions that fits the image of DA2 Qunari\n- improved atmosphere[www.nexusmods.com] - the title speaks for itself, you might want to play without it first then install it midgame to feel the difference\n- skip ostagar[www.nexusmods.com] - that's rather for people that play it for 2nd (or more) time and don't want to waste their time on the ostagar chapter\n- skip the fade[www.nexusmods.com] - same as above. Skips part of the quest in mage's tower. Used it due to the quest being, uh, annoying after few times\n\nThat's all I guess, if you haven't played this game yet and you like RPGs I strongly suggest you to try it out, it is one of the must-play titles for everyone!","February 13","true","76.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

This had a lot more depth to the desicion mechanics, interactions between characters, immersion and overall story presentation. Side quests actually have a proper backroung story and diolog options whereas in Inqusition, they are similar to a typical mmo levelling quest. Their purpose is to offer a grinding source in order to reach the main story mission and they aren't enjoyable. Origins base game offered a decent amount of content for it's price. The only downside on the original Dragon Age game compared to the newer ones is it's combat.","November 1, 2015","true","40.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

It definitely has some of the most memorable companions (imo). I don't usually like to do pros and cons, but it's hard to break down this game any other way. so:\n\nPros:\n- Incredible story. You really can't find a better underdog story than this, especially if you go the City Elf route. Not to mention that this could probably compete with Game of Thrones with all of the scheming and backstabbing.\n- Six unique backstories. Sure the general plot stays the same, but with six different introduction stories, the game becomes very re-playable.\n- Companions. Aside from the dog that you'll probably forget you even have, your companions are very unique and interesting. From Alistair to Zevran, they all have a personality that is hard to forget. Well, except for Sten, but he's memorable in other ways.\n- Engrossing. The first time I played this, I was so involved in the story, I could hardly believe it when I checked the clock and saw that 3 hours had passed like nothing.\n-Content. It will take a while for you to finish this game, no doubt about that. I generally average about 30 hours to finish, and that's without doing half of the side quests.\n\nCons:\n- Combat. Don't expect the combat to be very exciting. It's a bit slow paced, and you'll spend most of your time watching your party take their sweet time to swing their swords while you wait for their abilities to cooldown.\n- Dungeons. A lot of the dungeons are really drawn out. You'll spend so long fighting your way though the quests that you'll probably forget why you're there in the first place.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game an 8.5/10. You won't be wasting your money here.\nSo what do you say? Are you ready to join the Night's Watch (er... Grey Wardens!) and take on the evil White Walkers (er... Darkspawn...) to determine the fate of Westeros?

Dragon Age is quite possibly, nay, without question, the greatest work of fiction ever produced in any medium. In all the 63 years I have played video games, I have never in my life encountered such a powerful, emotionally moving masterpiece. This game was so utterly amazing that I "encouraged" (read: forced) my 4 year old grandson to play so that he might better understand what a watershed work of art this is. Undoubtedly, it is the most important piece that will be produced in my lifetime, and I think I can safely assume his as well. He didn't understand it at first, but after a few rigorous beatings he finally came to grips with the profundity of what he was experiencing. He would later insist that he merely feigned interest in order to avoid further beatings, but I dismissed his crude humor with a hearty laugh and a swift kick to the groin. It was clear to both of us that we were a part of something bigger than ourselves. I award Dragon Age 11 points out of 10 without reservation. Please play this game. Please force your children to play this game. Please force your children's children to play this game by any means necessary. If anyone ever tries to convince you this game is so much as a hair width short of perfection, promptly beat them to death with the nearest blunt object.\n\nEnjoy.","November 17, 2014","true","14.0"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","70","7","10","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrossSection/recommended/17450/","CrossSection","Cross-Section","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CrossSection/","394 products in account","Dragon Age: Origins represents the final, yet surprisingly dignified breath of the big budget/big publisher party-based isometric RPG (in the same vein as Baldur's Gate, Icewind Dale, etc). The combat is streamlined just enough to be accessible to a broad audience, but also allows for second-by-second strategy, as well as ability/item use for individual party members via the Tactics menu. The companions themselves... well, they're written at least as well as their predecessors from earlier Bioware games, though not terribly deviating from genre conventions. People generally complain about the brownish, detail-less graphics, which thankfully can be at least partially rectified through use of texture mods and color filter mods like SweetFX; in the end, however, this was conceived as an isometric-view RPG for a reason (as far as graphics go).\n\nThe actual "Origins" part of the game, aka the multiple races and backgrounds you can choose from in the player character creator, is well-integrated into the adventure as a whole; the atmosphere produced from playing as a Dwarven Noble compared to one developed through starting out as a Circle Mage can be substantially different, affecting your story decisions and companion interactions. Speaking of playing as a Mage: please do. Or don't; it basically depends on your willingness to become a swirling-firestorm death god and subsequently, shred any pretense of balance. Such a career choice can be quite fun, but also somewhat boring; players worried about such an issue can merely avoid choosing the "Spirit Warrior" specialization which, for the most part, serves as the source of the class's overpowered nature.\n\nAs far as DLC goes, most of it is nonessential from either a story or gameplay perspective, but get the Ultimate Edition anyway: It's a ridiculously better value than buying the few above-average DLCs and expansions (well, expansion) separately.\n\n\n","July 28, 2014","true","272.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

It had(and still do) many elements that felt half finished, so eventually i traded it in for something else. A while later I bought it on STEAM, after thinking that the experience might be different on the computer...and what a good decision that was! The character control feels so much better using the keyboard. This will be apparent when you find yourself in a tight spot during battle, which you will. It's somewhat unbalanced (caster > everything else) but the given the story driven nature of the game, i found myself quite okay with that aspect and totally in love with how the controls work on PC. The good voice acting, the visual scenery and the quality of the dialogues that shape your experience, are as usual from Bioware, top notch. I actually repeated this procedure with Mass Effect, going from console to PC(ME2) and again found myself appreciating the game much more on the computer, but that's a different story.","April 3","true","83.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

DAO may look like it takes it's inspiration from old Infinity Engine games but this is not the case, the game is an action RPG, with poor voice-acting, mediocre storytelling and little to no tactical elements in the combat sequences.\n\nWhile the game is not completely bad, and even takes many steps in what I'd consider "The right direction", it is still a monument to the fact that Bioware is no longer interested in making games that challenge their fans. No longer wants us to question ethics, to be inquisitive or to play any of their games more than once. It is the tombstone of the old Bioware.","November 4, 2012","true","339.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

It carries interesting messages which a lot of gamers don't care to think about, due to the fact that most gamers don't tend to think at all, so I'm surprised this game is as popular as it is. It's pretty neat, though, for much different reason than the second game. The first game is a really cool story; the second game is a really averge story with really pretty location, object, and character designs, and cheesy, cartoonish animations that don't fit the mood of the game world in the least.

I have fallen behind on playing it however, and for good reason. Im stuck. When your stuck your royal stuck and screwed. Its impossible to back track enough to get unstuck, especiallywhen you get into the higher levels. I got into a room and immediatly get screwed over within 3 minutes. Its a strategy I have yet to overcome, even though I have repeated it 9 times. At this point, the developers should have input a mechanic that let you back track, because after that first fail, there is no recovery. Other then that, it has beautiful graphics, a great action control, good A.I control and NPC partners. Dogs my favorite. Hands down. No matter what race you go with as well, YOU ALWAYS GET A DOG <3 This is a game I feel a bunch of skyrim people would like. Its a challenging strategy that has you on your wits end and emotional too.

The combat is excellent in that it's less about timing and more about managing the entire party's skills and abilities. The round-based faux-realtime combat makes for an easy method to alter plans when paused and in turn makes combat a fun game in it's own right.\n\nCombine all that with an excellent story, a fleshed out world, and excellent voice acting for well-written characters and you get a perfect update to what is essentially a classic RPG.\n\nMake no mistake, the game lacks the "exciting" animations of movie-esque combat, but that's fine considering the world's take on things. Realistic-ye-fantasy works so well for the game, providing a much needed grounding for characters' abilities to be believable.\n\nIf you haven't picked up Dragon Age, grab the bundle, enjoy all the DLC and expansion content.","July 3, 2011","true","78.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game begins with you customising and creating your character. Each class and race you choose has an orgin story. Regardless, you begin your journey through your orgin story and find the Grey Wardens, the only order that can stand against the Blight. The blight is an ancient sickness that unites the darkspawn, thousands of evil biengs bent on nothing but the destruction of Fereldan. Can the wardens stand against the hordes of the darkspawn, or will Fereldan forever be crushed under its might? I personally enjoy the gameplay during battles and during the dialogue.  When in combat, you are able to pause the game (space) and figure out how your party will work out the battle. Combat tactics are also available so that your party has preset behaviors they will follow in a battle. Unlike Mass Effect, the good choices and the evil choices are not easily distinguishable. These choices not only shape who your character is, but also how your compainons feel about you. I hope this reveiw has helped you and I ask you one question.

It's a big, literally epic-scale, slow-paced story heavy game with overflowing inventory and an original but not too unfamiliar fantasy world. Fans of action should try its sequel, Dragon Age 2, first - but those looking for something other than a quick adrenaline rush will find much to explore within.

Probably one of the best in party based rpg' s to date...\n\nTo be honest; i have to tell that i was not a die hard fan of party based rpg's until this one. But this game does everything right. What i mean by that is; while it contains all the elements a party based rpg might have; it does not overuse any of them. The game is in an absolute balance in this regard.\n\nIt does not choke you in wall of texts, dialogs, lore, combat, dungeons etc. Every element is on a right dosage. Even the most criticized portion "The Fade" has some interesting mechanics which might appeal to someone. Besides; you always have the option to do some other things if you get bored. Like chatting with your party members, exploring the lore reading codexes, doing some side missions, crafting and so on...\n\nThe main plot is a classic save the world scheme with some interesting plot twists and consequences. Not a masterpiece, but definetely above average. You may encounter some really good missions, conflicts, moral choices on your way to the end.\n\nGraphics and art style blend well together and are consistent with the lore. I believe the game holds really well to this date on this matter.\n\nBut what makes this game so special is its gameplay and mainly combat. Personally; i always look for freedom and full control in games containing tactical elements. Only a minority can give that to you. Most of the time; you' ll be crippled by a combination of different gameplay mechanics like bad and unresponsive unit ai, inefficient ui, lack of camera options, slow animations or simply combat being so fast that you can' t catch up with the pace... Let me tell you; Dragon Age does it all right near perfection. You can play the game in anyway you like.\n\nLike me; you can use all the intruments available to you and dictate the course of the combat. Or; you can simply customize the tactics to your pleasure and play it like an action rpg. Simply; you can be anywhere between these two extremes in playstyles. Which means; if you want to, you can really make every encounter different from each other. This is huge. And i believe it contributes a lot to your satisfaction and to the game's replayability.\n\nBesides all above;\n\nInability to respec and pre-specced party members is not in line with the freedom i have mentioned. But may be considered consistent within the lore. "Awakenings" lets you respec and you can always use a mod to do that in "Origins" anyways. So it is not a big deal.\n\nItemization is another weak aspect of the game. At least that is how i feel. Most of the time you' ll see items with random and useless attribitues to your class. They do not really contribute much to your gameplay and most of them are not appealing to your eyes especially mage helmets. I mean; itemization is not that bad but it is not an integral part of the game either. You feel like it got less attention because of that.\n\nSome missions may bore you, especially during replays. Like the ones involving "The Fade" and "The Deep Roads" which everybody is talking about. But they can be moded out.\n\nUltimate Edition has region lock in Steam. I don' t know why but it is really annoying. Also Dlc' s are way overpriced for a 4 year old game and nearly never gets a discount. But there are some sort of free stuff downloadable via Bioware' s website being mainly cosmetics and items. The game also has a toolset for modding and editing that you can download if you are interested with this stuff.\n\nAnyways; while you can find some flaws and issues with the game here and there; they are all minor annoyances considering the fun you' ll get out of it. Therefore; i strongly reccomend it to anyone new or familiar to the genre. It is really one of the best...","December 22, 2013","true","396.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The combat is excellent in that it's less about timing and more about managing the entire party's skills and abilities. The round-based faux-realtime combat makes for an easy method to alter plans when paused and in turn makes combat a fun game in it's own right.\n\nCombine all that with an excellent story, a fleshed out world, and excellent voice acting for well-written characters and you get a perfect update to what is essentially a classic RPG.\n\nMake no mistake, the game lacks the "exciting" animations of movie-esque combat, but that's fine considering the world's take on things. Realistic-ye-fantasy works so well for the game, providing a much needed grounding for characters' abilities to be believable.\n\nIf you haven't picked up Dragon Age, grab the bundle, enjoy all the DLC and expansion content.","July 3, 2011","true","78.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played KOTOR a few dozen times and I just finished DAO. It was great--everything I expected.\n\nThe formula is classic Bioware RPG, which is 90% good.\nThe inability to respec can be solved by some Nexus Mods, and the ugly/glitchy textures can be solved that way too. Definitely look into that.\n\nIt's an old game, I think the graphics are still decent, but it can cause some hardware issues--as you can see from most of the forum posts. MAKE SURE you upgrade the textures, it helps the Denerim crashing a lot--though not 100%.\n\nThe story is great, you really feel you are the character and you develop a strange attachment to your character's romantic partner(s).\n\nTake that as you will ;)\n\n\nATM I'm currently resisting the urge to play the game again...","August 4, 2014","true","93.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It takes time to get used to, especially the combat system. Your companions and yourself will die a lot untill you really figure out how to properly play and especially skill the classes. The tactics system might seem confusing at start but once you get the hang of it you will realise that this is one of the probably most powerful tools ever included into any kind of game. Maybe a bit overextended but I think this works even better than most strategy games or tactic-based games like Operation Flashpoint or ArmA.\n\nAs for the story, I won't exactly say what's going on incase anybody is afraid of spoilers, but I can tell that it sounds like the usual "Let's save the world once more"-stuff, which it actually is, but when looking at the details, you can tell how much effort and love the developers spent designing this story. Every decision you make will change the outcome of the game. You can have romances with your companions as well solve some quests involving their personal past.\n\nConclusion: GET. THIS. GAME. Even one of the biggest RPG-game-haters (which is currently writing this rewiew) fell absolutely in love with Dragon Age.\n\nCan't wait for Dragon Age: Inquisition.\n\nPS: Don't ♥♥♥♥ with Leilana.

The game begins with you customising and creating your character. Each class and race you choose has an orgin story. Regardless, you begin your journey through your orgin story and find the Grey Wardens, the only order that can stand against the Blight. The blight is an ancient sickness that unites the darkspawn, thousands of evil biengs bent on nothing but the destruction of Fereldan. Can the wardens stand against the hordes of the darkspawn, or will Fereldan forever be crushed under its might? I personally enjoy the gameplay during battles and during the dialogue.  When in combat, you are able to pause the game (space) and figure out how your party will work out the battle. Combat tactics are also available so that your party has preset behaviors they will follow in a battle. Unlike Mass Effect, the good choices and the evil choices are not easily distinguishable. These choices not only shape who your character is, but also how your compainons feel about you. I hope this reveiw has helped you and I ask you one question.

Bioware is simple one of the most EPIC game development companies I have ever seen. The story is deep and involving. The graphics are simply breath taking and the battle system (as well as the Player/NPC relationships) are really intense and thought out.  If you plan on getting this game, though, I would have to recommend getting the Ultimate Edition. Not only do you save money with that but you also get every bit of DLC Bioware has come out with for this game. Words alone fail to describe just how grand this game really is. I give it a 10/10.","February 13, 2011","true","291.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

I have very fond memories of DA:O, so I might be biased (and the game is also a bit older), but I highly recommend it. Take the choice-based story system from Mass Effect, add greater depth and some lore behind it, plus a turn-based combat that functions well, and you have Dragon Age: Origins. If you don't play it, at least watch the trailer. Because that captures the atmosphere of the game perfectly. This is a good old-fashioned Bioware game, before the more modern influences like DLC money grabs.","January 25","true","75.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Probably more than I should have, and I think at one point my wife was jealous of the attention I gave it.\n\nThe graphics are kinda middling, which is kinda sad, considering how much prettier the Mass Effect series was. Also, though the game was marketed as a dark fantasy, the setting and story really doesn't seam to draw much from George R. R. Martin, but instead from another author with two Rs in the middle of his name. You lead a not-fellowship to wage a war against not-orcs, to finally defeat not-Smaug picking up multiple Nouns-Of-Gerund along the way.\n\nThe combat, however, is both challenging and fun. It can be played from either a pause-and-play tactical isometric perspective, or a more visceral, action-oriented over-the-shoulder perspective. Things become particularly interesting when you add spellcasters to the mix. Many players of Dungeons and Dragons, will quickly recognize the simultaneous feeling of glee and dismay of accidentally incinerating your compatriots with an ill-targeted fireball with just a little too large a radius. Friendly fire can be turned off, though, for those so inclined.\n\nFor me though, one of the real appeals was the apparent fluidity of the story and incorporation of choice as a central element. Gone are the melodramatic moral decisions of past Bioware games, where you are choosing between saving an orphanage or committing genocide. These are replaced by hard choices where both sides have merits and flaws. Also gone are the binary morality meters, and are now replaced by levels of loyalty/amicability between yourself and each of your companions. For every choice, it seems like it will be popular with some in your group, and unpopular with others, and it's not all based on some oversimplified alignment code, but more on each characters individual values and history, which you will have plenty of interaction and clues leading up to these choices, so you feel like you have some insight in the consequences. There may still be some surprises though. These choices will also extend to the beginning at character creation, and each character you create can have different origin stories which will have varying degrees of reference and relevence throughout the story all the way until the end.\n\nAll these choices do have a limitation however, by the time you get to the end of the game, you may notice that for the most part, the consequences of your choices are mostly cosmetic. Whether you chose one side or another in a given conflict, really only determines the look of the disposable units you get in a final battle, and the grand story arch is fairly immutable. By the time you may realize this, though, it has been a fun ride, and it doesn't really diminish the grand feeling of shaping your story, and being torn on certain decisions along the way.\n\nFinally, if you opt to buy the dlc, I recommend avoiding the in-game downloader, it takes FAR too long and is very buggy. Instead visit the bioware social site, log in to your profile and download and install them from there. It's much faster and hassle free.","December 28, 2013","true","140.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is the first game in the Dragon Age franchise. Set in the fictional kingdom of Ferelden during a period of civil strife, the player assumes the role of a warrior, mage or rogue coming from an elven, human, or dwarven background who must unite the kingdom to fight an impending invasion by demonic forces. There is no tracking of moral alignment, just party favor. The player will accomplish different goals depending on if they choose to be good or evil, but the decisions that the player makes in the process will change the game world accordingly – deciding who will become king, for example, and affecting nations, races and their places in the world. These decisions will also influence the companion NPCs, possibly causing an NPC to leave the party or even attack the player if they disagree strongly with his or her actions. Your character begins the game by completing one of the six origin stories corresponding to the race and background of the character he or she created upon choosing a new game; the choices are Human Noble, Magi, Dalish Elf or City Elf, Dwarf Commoner or Dwarf Noble. The origin story determines the biography of the character and how NPCs react to the player for the rest of the game. For example, elves are often viewed as second class citizens by humans, while mages are treated with suspicion and fear, while the human noble is treated with respect. While exploring Ferelden, Your character will be presented with the opportunity to partake in numerous side-quests to flesh out the Dragon Age mythology, acquire powerful equipment, and earn experience points. Potential companions who have their own special ability/combat specialties and back-stories will also present themselves and offer to join the player's quest. Overall my rating for Dragon Age: Origins is 10/10 it is probably the best RPG game I have played so far. There is just so much to do in the game apart from the main questline for example there are plenty of side quests available for you to play throughout the game as well as the game having a very long and a really interesting story that will keep you entertained for a long time. I really recommend this game it is probably by far the best RPG game out there in my opinion. So once again I really recommend you get Dragon Age: Origins because I am absolutely without a single doubt 100% sure that Dragon Age: Origins will not disappoint you in anyway!.","September 10, 2014","true","9.9"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

You can love or hate a lot of the characters and that makes the game really more interesting.\n- Lot of interactions between the characters either in a dungeon or just messin around.\n- Many forms of play from being a warrior, magician, rouge, etc.\n- Lot of vast scenes and levels, each one makes you feel little in a fantastic world.\n- Great animations during the fights and movie cut-scenes, gives you a feeling you are not only playing a videogame but also watching a film or TV series.\n- Lot of possible endings for not only you but for each character or decision you take.","December 6, 2013","true","78.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

These made the game unenjoyable for me on PC. The game also starts to show the bad writing and poor motion capture that plagued Bioware all throughout Mass Effect 3 and The Old Republic; the characters' origin stories are uninspired social justice rants railing against humans/normality and cutscenes convey little to no emotion or life, for example. Characters are also very stereotypical: Evil is evil because reasons (or because they are normal humans doing normal human things which are or inevitably lead to evil), Good can do no wrong (as long as you are not a normal human), and every 'deviant' is oppressed to the extreme yet glorified and noble.\n\nI really like stories (such as Neverwinter Nights from old Bioware), so I will probably finish this game someday, but I cannot recommend it to anyone. The later parts might be better, if you have to play this particular series.","April 19, 2015","false","7.1"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

A horde of orcs Darkspawn is ravaging lands once in a few centuries. Why? Because they are evil.\nThere is a bunch of gifted people called Witchers Grey Warden who can sense Darkspawn and fight them effectively but at high price.\nSome jerk decides to overtake the throne in a middle of yet another Horde invasion Blight leaving his king in a middle of a battle.\nNow you must visit Dantooine, Manaan and Korriban several locations to get help.\nHere is your story, take it and feel the epicness!\n\nGameplay:\nHey guys, we need to get it to 80 hours mark! No problem, let's make it a grind through series of battles every 20 meters from each other. Exploration and vistas? Pfff, who need that.\nOh, and we should make almost every fight a micromanagement hell because "hardcore".\nBloody brilliant idea! Hey, about bloody... We are making dark tone fantasy here so there will be BLOOD, BLOOD EVERYWHERE. See those rats? Decaliter of blood under high pressure in every one of them. Splat!\nHere is your gameplay, better check your Spacebar key, son, you gonna need it.\n\nPresentation:\nEveryone love MMOs.\nAbility bars. Big exlamation marks above quest givers. DPS. Rudimenary inventory screen with little icons. Marvelous!\nAnd as I said, we are making dark tone fantasy here so everyting going to be 50 shades of brown.\nHere is your singleplayer MMO, now go grind some more to get 5 minutes of dialogues.

I played this game somewhat on xbox 360 and got it on a sale for PC.  Completely different combat.  The PC version tries to get you to play like Dota 2 / LoL.  I personally hate this "click to run" style game for an RPG as it completely takes out any immersion the game has.  Some other points about combat - be sure to press "h" to get characters in free run mode.  If they are not in free run mode and you select them to run close to an enemy, but the enemy is behind them, characters on your team will happily get hacked to death in the back instead of turning around.  Go to my profile and look at my screenshots for this game if you want, there are plenty of them with my teammates happily getting killed.  The point and click also fails when trying to select an enemy to attack.  Several times while clicking an enemy in the heat of battle I accidentally selected behind the enemy.  My character then runs past the enemy and faces away from the enemy, and begins to get hacked from behind (and of course does no turn around until I do it manually).\n\nFinally, think of Dark Souls.  Games with over the shoulder combat are generally known to be better with a gamepad.  Of course this is not an option in the menu.\n\nThis was a great game on console, but completely destroyed on PC thanks to the terrible combat mechanics.","February 4, 2014","true","6.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","5"

Each race has three story lines, and although you still follow the same main storyline, the starting stories give each version a different feel. I have put DAYS, nay, WEEKS into this game. I'm still playing it now. I cannot recommend this more highly, if you like RPG type games. I can take or leave DA II, but have high hopes for the third one, when it comes out. Everyone should play DA:O. It should be made Law. You should not be able to have a Steam account unless you have played DA:O right to the end, on at least one race/class/background, whether through Steam or EA or just a boxed copy of the game, played without attachment to anything else (as I did, first time I played it). PLAY THIS GAME!!!\n\nOn a side note, I see that it shows I've played an hour of this via Steam. I just installed it from the disc, on the first day it was out, and don't recall registering it with EA. I can say you get at least 50 hours of play each run through. There are 3 races to choose from, with 2 back stories, and 3 classes. I've played every version, background story, class, race - I estimate I have played a minimum of 450 hours - probably more, considering I have a few double played classes/races (one female, one male version)\n\nThe rogue is the best class, if you like being able to open every chest in the game. Warrior is best if you just like to go in and beat everything to death, although one of the main sidekicks makes an awesome tank. The Mage is a fun class to play, if you like sparkles and fighting from a distance (or healing).","May 9, 2014","true","18.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The story line is well told, the voice acting is one of the best I have heard in a long time, and the world and lore present in the game is excellent enough to get you hooked. This game is not for the casual rpg gamer though. It employs a tactics based gameplay that is crucial for winning every match you get in to. You really need to learn how to use this system for many things but it is well worth the time. So in conclusion, if you are a RPG gamer and are willing to take the time to learn the combat system, you will be shown a story that will have you wanting more.","December 19, 2010","true","619.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you get this version you can also get Awakening but Awakening does not have all dlc, and there is no option to upgrade from either Origins or Awakening to the Full version.\nIf you want Dragon Age with all the dlc save some money and confusion and get the Ultimate edition.\nI suggest you wait for a sale or whatever and get the Ultimate edition seeing as the Ultimate edition has Origins, Awakenings, and is the only way to get all dlc aside from paying roughly $30 in Bioware points using the weird online store they set up to take more money from you.\nThat being said Dragon Age is a good game with plenty of atmosphere and story. I originally played on the PS3 and wish the Steam version had controller support but it is nonetheless a good game, the graphics still hold up well and the playtime is extensive, sadly I got wrapped up in work and have been unable to finish the game but will start over and play again. Luckily I got the Origins base version in a bundle so it cost me little to get this version for rating purpose, I had to play some in order to leave a review so the listed playtime is inaccurate and I will now play from the Ultimate edition.\n","April 27, 2015","false","0.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I bought it because of the overwhelming hype claiming that this is one of the best RPG's ever made. Sadly, what I found was pretty much a hack and slash action RPG with, sure, lots of in game stuff you can read about the world, but the actual gameplay involves very little that isn't simply bashing through armies of enemies Diablo style. This is an okay game, if I could give it a neutral instead of yes or no I'd give it that instead. It's glitchy and on my i7 Windows 10 machine with 16GB RAM crashed several times even with affinity set to 1. Several of the quests bugged out and at times textures disappeared too. A lot of the battle sequences are overly long, yet not all that challenging, patricularly the final battle and the Fade part of the game. I had to force myself to continue several times because I simply got bored with clicking enemies to death and pausing the game a million times to micro manage each character. Sometimes the characters just stand there and get bashed in the head even though you give them orders. There is nothing original or interesting about the plot or game mechanics, it's essentially Baldur's Gate 2 with more fighting and bugs. I honestly don't know what the fuss is about, and in my books this game falls far short from something like Ultima 7 (which I still consider the king of RPG's) or even Skyrim. 5 / 10.","October 16, 2015","false","48.2"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Bear that in mind when you see my 75 hours playtime. I bought this since I'd played Neverwinter Nights by BioWare and enjoyed it greatly, liked Knights of the Old Republic well enough despite its shallow and predictable story with flat characters, but was disappointed with Jade Empire -- it seemed rushed and incomplete.\n\nFor the longest time, playing this gave me vague hints of deja vu. I knew that the interface and gameplay reminded me an awful lot of World of Warcraft, so that wasn't the source of my unease. After 75 hours of suffering my irritating emo companions and doing fetch and deliver quests typical of MMOs, I finally realized: it was the same plot setting as Jade Empire, and to a lesser extent, KotOR. "You are the last jedi/martial artist/gray warden of the council/dojo/demon-blood-drinking-cult, and it falls upon you to save the galaxy/empire/world!"\n\nOkay, so it's not an uncommon setting, but BioWare just does such an astounding, jaw-dropping job of rehashing stereotypes and making them even more bland and hackneyed than previously believed to be scientifically possible. In a sense, it's an amazing achievement, but I can hold more appreciation for "World's Largest Ball of Dryer Lint."","January 29","false","74.9"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","4","10","0","0"

Indeed the storyline is far from new and largely inspired by the classic "Humans, Dwarfs-living-in caves, elves-living-in-forests" scenario. The idea of a dark threat lingering in the depths, waiting to eradicate the known world is also nothing new in the RPG world.\nDragon Age: Origins however manages to put a decent emphasis on the roleplay part. The fact that your possible dialogue options merely consist of the standard 3 ones (polite, not interested and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) does come as a little off, though.\n\nYet, I do not recommend this game and that is because of the gameplay.\nUnfortunately, DA:Os story just isn't good enough to turn it into an "interactive-movie" kind of game. Therefore, the game has to rely on decent gameplay features such as world connection, quality of travel and most importantly battle mechanics. It is these features that take away the fun, in my opinion. The world is not open, but divided into towns and outposts with "level-like" areas connected to them. The battle mechanics rely on you pausing the game and giving 10 different orders before you start the fight and probably fail due to someone not being healed quickly enough.\nEven repeatedly pushing an attack button is more fun than this approach Bioware has taken to the game.","June 4, 2015","false","42.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Dragon age had pretty good game play...at first. I enjoyed it a lot...at first. but it got boring really fast as the gameplay and plot became very repetative. The plot was pretty boring, and repetative, and the diferent segments of the game did not feel connected. Go there do this, so somewhere else do something completely different. And the gray wardens were...lets say dull. Then there's relationships with the characters in your party. If you listen to what the game says, it's really deep and your decisions effect different characters in different ways. Which is great and all, and they DO do that, it's just....if you buy them random gifts they like you so much that it doesn't matter. (not to mention none of the characters is really very interesting.)\nOverall, the game got boring for me real quick. The only reason I ever beat it was because I kept thinking I was SO CLOSE, so I might as well finish it off...but if I had just known from the beginning how long this game would drag on, I would have dropped it then and there.","March 25","false","79.3"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It, is, in fact, Bioware's first entry into generic fantasy.\n\nYou start out making your character: do you want to be male or female? okay, do you want to be a dwarf, elf, or human? What.. Is this a Korean MMO? Bare in mind that this game opens a whole new universe of lore for a new franchise, so of course they're going to front their most creative minds when it comes to character design for this brand new lore.\n\nWell, now you get to select classes: Warrior, mage or rogue. Maplestory has more classes. Bioware's other games have more classes, and one of them is a third person shooter. This is a long-run RPG that boasts over a hundred hours of content. Granted, there are 4 subclasses, to be unlocked at some undisclosed point. Still, nothing interesting therein as far as I can tell. Subclasses get an extra dash of five talents when they're unlocked. I can't speak for deep later in the game, but that's what I've been shown.\n\n\nEach race has two starting stories, three if you're a mage. This is a great innovation, and the starting story is reasonably engaging. However, even this achievement only shows to shine light on the game's failings in presentation. The stories to start are engaging, expose a world ripe for character developement. However, within the first hour characters are yanked out of their own story where the producer says "wasn't that nice? forget that, here's a new story".\n\nConverse to every other BioWare game, the introduction has more replay value and than the rest of the game seems to. In fact, as soon as you've gotten to the 'real game' on more than one character, the story seems to saterize itself. It doesn't matter if you're a 6'0 elf male or a 4'3 dwarf female (let's not talk about skin color, nobody in the game does; I'm black with a white family of course), that only changes a few responses and interactions with certain characters. It doesn't change who you feel you are or who the story thinks you are. Its a little funny to see, having been an elf, that the king who welcome you to this "real story" looks you in exactly the same spot when you're a dwarf. "Oh, and who might you be? *looks 4 feet over your head*" The stories all lead to the same place, directed by the same people, with little implication to your choices at this point.\n\nThe main characters are generic caricatures, and anyone of interest is killed off immediately. You're led about by Kyle Katarn, principly, who is so "honor driven" he kills innocent people right infront of you with no moral implication given by the story. The king character is constantly talking about how much he wants to be the subject of legends and to win glory, and all anyone says about him is 'this guy only wants to have songs written about him and to get all the glory'. I really like the side characters, like your dwarven friend, your elfen cousin, or your big dumb soldier friend. But, of course "they can't possibly come with us", etc, etc.\n\nWhen I was a kid, you had Final Fantasy 7, where you started in an endless metropolis, ran across a swamp being chased by a giant snake, wound up in shimmering emerald mountain caves, and came out at a military base town with a giant awesome gun mounted to it. In Dragon Age: Origins you start in a town, then you go to the woods and fight orcs, then you go to an outpost.. and fight orcs. There's no variety or anything pulling me in here. There's nothing monumental to introduce me to this new universe, no stimulation besides a story that's immediately killed and replaced.\n\nWhat reinforces this is the 'you don't feel like a hero' aspect. You're the up and coming champion of the Grey Wardens, you're an excellent fighter, besting seasoned veterans, guards, nobility. How does the combat in the game work in the first few hours? You see an enemy, then you right-click it, then you watch your health bar to see if you need a potion. Its basically World of Warcraft lite.\n\nWhy would I want to see what's more to be offered by this title when they've seemingly put no effort into making it presentable? It doesn't give me the impression that there's much progression, even, because I'm just seeing very linear talent trees (5 talents to about 6 weapon specific trees, and a few for class and crafting).\n\nThe game plays like a party-based diablo-esque, but your party is killed off every 5 minutes and reintroduced again, leaving one to care very little about what the other characters in your squad are doing. This is how you introduce people to a modern MMO, not a long-run RPG.\n\nThis is just a first impression, and I might play it more, but this is probably the worst first impression I've gotten from a game. It just seems to have little to offer beyond 'BioWare made it'. Maybe if Obsidian had made this game it would have made more sense.","April 17, 2015","false","7.0"," 17 of 37 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","17","37","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soulstuff/recommended/17450/","Soulstuff","Soulstuff","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Soulstuff/","205 products in account","Ive heard alot of praise for this game and DA series in total so i got my hands on it just to see for myself.\n\nDont get the wrong idea that i dont recommend this game while only played 2 hours of it. This is my first impresion of the game so my overall opinion might change after more gameplay.\n\nPersonally im the type of guy who prefers butchering everything in complete first or third person camera with stealthy or tanky character not to mention i mostly hate companions because they mostly are ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and only good as extra inventory space..\n\nYea i know this game has 3rd person  too, yes i know that you can control your followers directly by yourself if needed but for the love of god you know 3rd person camera is ♥♥♥♥ when you cant even aim your shots with bow by yourself as its completely click and wait him to die and follower just faps while getting shot in hes ♥♥♥ if you dont hassle with taking controll over him just to attack that sniping lil bugger.\n\nLarge portion of you game youre going to spend watch them talking (if you dont skip it) and sometimes you will need to put your own replies ( i was being a total prick and there were no penalties ) tho i admit they put a lost of effort in character detail while they chat.\n\nAnother thing i didnt liked was turn based combat... I can deal with classic turn based combat games like Pokemon series, Aveyond Series (loved the first and 4th games), lets nor forget Final Fantasy i could list em quite a while, so for a 2009 game they just could done way better as they asleary using 3d enviroment. Yes ik its faster paced but still its meh.\n\nLast problem is that i can tell that game didnt got finished and released as i easily can manage to get under the map and ect. i mean cmon if you dont want player to noclip all over the place or take amazing adventure outside the area put god damn invisible walls. Jeez even Gothic 3 has invisible walls where you shouldnt go (there are some holes in them but takes forever to find them without video or somthing like that and get under the map)\n\n\nTo put it shortly:\n\nPros:\n\n+ Decent graphics\n+ You can be a total prick in conversations\n+ Fancy Graphics\n+ Quite good story\n+ Has Mods\n+ You can have a dog follower which you can even name by yourself\n+ Can take control over dumb follower and make him somewhat usefull\n\nCons:\n- You can glitch out of the maps (in most of the areas)\n- There is no big world to explore ( unlike in games as Gothic 3, Oblivion and ect.)\n- Follower AI quite ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ (getting attacked by archer and doesnt retaliate even while set to aggresive mode)\n- Camera is one of those "very hard to get used to"\n- Pause in the middle of fight just to give stupid AI follower some directions\n- Turn based combat (especially skills which remind me WoW with the casting mechanics)\n- Without follower youre kinda good as dead\n- Start of the game can make you bored\n- Class locked\n\n\n\n\nI will give this a try somewhat later and ofc update review if something changes.\n\nALSO KEEP IN MIND SO THAT IS MY OPINION. IF YOU HAVE YOUR OWN OPINION WHICH IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS GAME GO ON AND WRITE REVIEW LIKE I DID IT WONT KILL ANYONE","April 25, 2015","false","2.7"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

It's absolutely brilliant and I can't recall any other RPG that managed to do that so wonderfully.\n\nToo bad I would not be able to see how that story ends. Combat is awful, tactics are totally counter intuitive, dungeons are sometimes too long and dull. Difficulty settings are totally unbalanced. I played it on normal and it was good for first 10 hours maybe. Then every battle got awfuly long and boring. After switching to easy game was... easy. No challenge at all.\n\nMaybe it's just not game for me but after promising beginning, it came out different than expected. I feel disappointed.\n\nPS.

I'm a sucker for this style of game; say what you will about them, nobody really makes "Bioware RPGs" like Bioware does.  So it scratches the itch that Mass Effect 1 started me feelin' (and ME 2 and 3 destroyed completely, ♥♥♥♥ those games).  But in the end it just doesn't have the staying power it needs for me to recommend it in good conscience.\n\nHere's why.  It feels like all the effort that went into this game was put into the first 4 hours of playing it.  I was initially very impressed with the setting, the characterization, the writing, the way party members interact, the combat mechanics, the level of difficulty etc.  But don't be fooled!  Once you get access to the world map and have the ability to choose where you're going, the pacing falls apart, followed swiftly by all the rest of it.  Party members don't have interesting things to say in the field after a while.  Dialogue trees get exhausted quickly, and then nothing else happens with them at camp, either.  You've got some token "romance" ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t in there that's that borderline-offensive "relationships end after you go to bed with them because sex = you win" crap.  There's some choices to make, but they have no real impact.  There's some things you can do in a place that affect another place, and you'll go "oh hey i remember that", but then that's it.  That's the whole payoff.  Combat gets really simple and repetitive once you adjust.  It all just starts feeling like gray paste, like going through the motions ticking boxes.  Which is exactly what the ♥♥♥♥ing developers did, so screw em.\n\nGranted, I have like 75 hours on the books with this game, too.  So I guess you could say I got my money's worth?  I never did beat it, though.  I just played through every possible permutation of origin story.  Farthest I ever got was having like 3 or 4 of the main town hub areas' story quests completed.  I lost interest every time, until the next time I'd start it up after I forgot about how boring it was.  Also it bears mentioning that the graphics options don't include like, ANY of the COMPLETELY STANDARD pc gaming options.  Like, say, if you want to turn off or turn down shadows independently from particle effects?  Nope, ♥♥♥♥ you!  You get "low", "medium", or "high".  One slider bar, for the whole game's graphical quality.  Who even does that?","July 5, 2014","false","77.7"," 35 of 79 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","35","79","0","0"

On the other, it's boring, predictable, and has an awful combat system. That's the summary, anyway.\n\nBioware called it the "spiritual successor" to Baldur's Gate, but what that game had and this one lacks lies in the overall package rather than just one or two areas. The story, characters, and even the combat are all done better in those past games. This isn't just nostalgia talking. Baldur's Gate may have been my first, and still one of my favorite, WRPG series' i've played, but that does not mean I cannot find quality in more recent entires into this genre. And both Baldur's Gate and Dragon Age are Bioware games, so comparing the two, especially since the dev did it themselves, is entirely reasonable.\n\nDA:O ultimately is, at its core, exactly what you expect: you (yes you specifically) must save the world from impending doom because you have the special tool needed to do so. If you do not, then the endless armies of the dark enemy will overrun the world, as they have threatened to do before. And in order to win, you must rally as many allies as possible to join in a grand coalition that has to be able to hold off the enemy long enough for you to accomplish your mission.\n\nSound familiar? Yeah, it did to me too. Sorry Bioware, but just because the plot veers off in a few places and makes things more gritty and dark doesn't make the resemblance to Lord of the Rings less noticeable. Now LOTR was good, and still is, but it is also as standard and generic as fantasy stories get, and having yours so closely resemble that isn't a good sign.\n\nBut there is good here. It's not like this game is a bomb. It -is- good, and there are plenty of RPG fans out there who can enjoy this. I gave this a significant amount of playtime despite my issues. I might prefer Minsc to Alistair, but Alistair is still a good character as are most of the people you get into your party. The plot certainly has its moments, and even the great battle at the end that screams "I ripped this off from LOTR" is still quite good all on its own. But this game also has pathetically one-dimentional characters like Rendon Howe (whose sole purpose in the world is to be a completely dislikeable ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥) and obnoxious quest sections like the Fade (that people have made mods to -skip- this part of the game, I think, speaks volumes).\n\nI'd say this is a game for fans of fantasy RPG's, because anyone else is likely to be turned off by what they find here. And even for fantasy RPG fans may come the knowledge that, somewhere out there, other games exist that do it better than this one.\n\nThis may be a good game overall, but it is not good enough for me to recommend. Dig into this one more to find out if it really sounds like something you would be into.","January 1, 2014","false","136.0"," 48 of 127 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","48","127","0","4"

Quite an insane gamble I admit, but at the time it paid off.\n\nThe game was quite good for the first 30 hours or so, however most of the frustration comes from the remaining 7 hours of playtime and the after-sales issues.\n\nIt is quite possible to completely bodge up your skill spec while leveling up, making it near impossible to progress in the later half of the game, no chance I was going to restart a new character using a guide after 30 hours, I'll admit I probably sucked at the game, but there are others reporting that skill specs can be completely mucked up, personally I think it's just poor game design to allow this to happen, you should be able to go in blind to a game and not have to study a guide for workable specs in a SINGLE PLAYER game.\n\nEven worse is the addons. If you were one of the people who didn't buy the Ultimate Edition and bought the base pack at launch, good luck getting a discount on the expansion and addons!\n\nIt's literally cheaper to buy the Ultimate Edition than it is to buy the expansion and content packs, the ultimate edition even includes the base game, but you can't give away your extra copy. Another case of early buyers getting shafted.\n\nAll in all, the first 30 hours were great, and this game was THE game that taught me not to buy near launch anymore with a few notable exclusions.

Unfortunately, that's the peak of the game.  That's not to say the rest of the game is terrible, but there are numerous flaws that completely killed my enjoyment.  The first notable problem is the writing.  It isn't remotely realistic, because in this game, you are inexplicably the center of the universe, and every non-villain's priority is to lavish praise on you for no particular reason.  The second problem is the game's "difficulty".  Instead of making a genuinely challenging experience, whenever the game wants to make a section hard, they just pile a huge number of the area's strongest enemies into a single room, which prevents you from using any real strategy.  This wouldn't be too big a problem, but the AI is terrible: while the combat system is similar to FFXII's "gambit" system, which was my favorite combat system of all time, the problem is that the AI often fails to follow the gambits correctly.  For instance, when I set one of my charaters to use a light AOE attacking ability whenever there were 3 or more enemies surrounding them, they just froze in place trying to use it constantly--even when there were no enemies in sight--and wouldn't move until I turned that gambit off.  When I set them to instead use it on any enemy, they decided that this meant to use it whenever they saw an enemy, despite the fact that it was a melee attack and the enemy was across the room.  Aside from generaly misinterpreting their set gambits, they also invariably attack or heal the worst targets, due to the lack of FFXII's "attack party leader's target" option, or even an option to attack the strongest, weakest, or closest available target.  Thanks to all this, entering a room that you aren't overleveled for is nearly certain death unless you have a large number of healing items (which will chew through said healing items, weakening this "strategy" for later rooms) or have some nearby doors to repeatedly close to prevent extra enemies from attacking you.  Admittedly, if the enemies are spread out enough that you don't alert them all at once, you can sometimes deal with them by having all your melee characters wait a good distance away so they don't Leeroy Jenkins the room and get you killed.\n\nIf you can get over the writing and the combat, the game isn't too bad, but I really can't.","February 16, 2014","false","9.1"," 23 of 79 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","23","79","0","0"

It just feels like a lesser version of them.\n\nThe combat is just dreadfull. You can either control one character at a time in real time, or zoom out and try a more tactical approach. The thing is, it wont matter which you choose as combat lacks any meat. Your decisions on the battle field bearly matter. I think the bigger problem lies with the leveling system and the skills. They are so basic and boring and offer little choice as to how to build a character. Chances are one rogue will be 99% similar to any other rogue. In a game like Neverwinter (Not the dumbass free to play one on steam) there was meaningfull choice to be had when creating builds and leveling characters. I would spend hours just thinking about different builds.\n\nThe battles often feel like a 'staring at healthbars until one gets to low so I pause and give them a health potion' over and over again. As far as I have seen so far there are no healing spells or really much support spells. There isn't really any interconnection between players at all.\n\nSo that leaves 2 things that would keep you playing. The story, and the character building/dialogue.\n\nSo lets start with the story. I still have a good 25 hours left to play according to Howlongtobeat.com so I havn't seen all of the story. That being said..... I dont really care if I do. Its not a bad story but its been done before and there isnt much new to it. Basically a bunch of bad people are coming to kill everyone and you are the only one who can stop them. So you go from place to place amassing an army to fight them. Honestly it feels like Lord of the Rings. Its not a terrible story and I didn't really mind watching/listening to it, but there isn't anything there to make it different enough for me to WANT to hear the rest of it.\n\nThen there is the characters. At this point in the game I have unlocked 4 people. Again, they arent terribly written and do actually have some amusing and interesting dialogue. Honestly its the only thing that kept me going for as long as I did. However, your choices dont really have any noticable impact (at least not to the point I got to). There is a influence system in the game where characters like or hate you depending on your actions but aside from them possibly leaving if they hate you enough... there doesnt seem to be anything to it. There is a romance option but its just ends after taking someone to bed and doesnt actually change anything.\n\nOne of the issues of this system is that it is very easy to abuse. You can only have 3 people in your party at a time which I think is fine for combat but when you are in cities it creates a huge problem. Let me give you an example.\n\nOne of the first villages you get to has a merchant who has raised his prices to the point of extortion. You have a few options here. You can be on his side for some coin and drive off the crowd, persuade or intemidate him to behave, or do nothing at all. If you drive of the crowd Party member A approves of your actions and you gain plus 3 influence with them but Party member B hates it and gets -8 influence. If you persuade the salesman to lower his profits and sell at a reasonable price Party member A Hates it -8 and Party member B likes it +3. However! All you need to do is take either part member A or party member B out of the party and replace them with a character that doesnt care about this situation to get the outcome you want.\n\nThat is kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥. I think that it would have made the game MUCH more enjoyable if dialouge acted as though all party members were present. This would cause not only more interesting options, but it would mean your choices actually matter.\n\nI would have also liked to have seen some situations where your influence with a character did something. Say for instance at one point in the game you and person A walk off from camp to talk alone at X point in the game. Then a bandit or something attacks you. Now depeding on your influence with party member A they would either push you out of the way to take the attack themselves (high influence), Fight the bandit after he has stabed you and run him off/kill him (medium influence), run back to camp to get help (Low influence) or even they planed the attack themselves and the steal some money from you and run off (Critical influence). Just an example.\n\nI just cant see a reason to play this over something like Neverwinter Nights 2 which is an amazing game with great combat and what I mentioned above. Granted its not on Steam anymore for whatever reason which kind of sucks but you can still get it on GOG. I am actually curious to see what Dragon Age 2 did to ♥♥♥♥ people off so much but seeing as its not on steam I may not ever get around to it.\n\nWhich brings me to my last point. In your base camp a person appears with a quest above their head. "Neat" I said, "I wonder what he wants?" Only to find out its bloody DLC and it wants to to sign in to a EA account to pay for and download some dlc quest. Nothing breaks the fun faster than a paywall. Keep DLC on the ♥♥♥♥ing store and out of the game please.\n\nI am not sure if I am going to finish the game to be honest. I may play a few more hours and if nothing changes I will just call it a day. Maybe I will trying finding a lets play with some ammusing comentary to see the rest. Who knows.","October 18, 2014","false","7.7"," 7 of 41 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","7","41","0","0"

You will notice it in the form of swamp trails, forest paths, caves, and city roads. There is also the less frequent boss fight and more rarely a puzzle.  The game opening is too slow due to excessive use of (boring) dialogue and dragged out character introductions.\n\nSound:\nThe background music that supports the game is performed well for a game and is the typical orchestrated classical/folk styles, but the selection is very limited. All tracks are recorded in very good quality, but it gets repetitive too early in the story. Voice-overs and sound effects are also good qualtity, but again very limited in scope.\n\nStory:\nThe main story is non-original and lacks emotional engagement with the game play. Your task is to\nstop the Dark Spawn army from taking over the kingdom. This is a direct copy from LOTR dark lord Sauron's army, but there are dragons.  All the other races are there like mages, trees, spiders, elves, dwarfs. It even has the enchanted rings, but there are no hobbits.\n\nMechanics:\nThere is no quick travel which makes the game extra laborious. There is no open world, and maps get boring quickly due to repetitive events, and scenes. Game mechanics and HUD work well, but nothing special. The use of teamwork is exploited well, which was DAO only notable plus. Some quests in the game are not playable unless you download in-game DLC. You will only be able to learn this after selecting the quest while you are playing the game. My most enjoyable take from DAO was the selectable team members you use to achieve each quest.\n\nSummary:\nDAO is an average game in scope and entertainment. Your enjoyment in playing the game will be quickly overtaken by its boring repetitions.","December 28, 2013","false","97.6"," 14 of 60 people (23%) found this review helpful","23","14","60","0","0"

However I cannot recomend this game on steam. It has way too many bugs the worst of which I encountered was a game crash upon using an AOE item like an acid flask.\n\nI have 110 total hours into the xbox 360 version of this game. If you like Rpgs then you will like this game and the voice acting and writing is witty, the only reason not to like this game which I can understand is all the bugs it has, the ugly graphics and the many boring dungeon crawls.\n\nThe gameplay is nice however there isnt any real strategy to be had when things get tough you just spam health potions to win. Once I figured out how to have party members have scripts to automatically heal them selves and use mana potions accordingly the game became quite easy at least on normal mode.\n\nIf you do buy this game you are not missing anything if you skip the expansion and DLC. I found all the DLC to be garbage. It feels really low quality compared to the original game. In the xpac you cant even use any of the original party members from the core game(Besides Ogrhen) which makes it boring and the story was mediocre the high point was the new weapons and armor not any of the dialogue.","September 8, 2013","false","18.9"," 7 of 43 people (16%) found this review helpful","16","7","43","0","0"

I don't like the part of the game where you have to go to Ostagar but the rest of the game but the rest of the game is part of an epic series of games and beats most other games in their story.\n\nDialog: 9/10\nYou have to go around finding people to help you solve the blight. The characters in this game have emotion instead of an card board cut out of a person. The people [your companions] actually makes you what to listen to the people [companions] unlike some games the voice acting is excellent you can understand what the people say I would recommend this game to anyone who likes role playing games. The people [companions] in this game are brought by gifts they like you and will even jump into bed with you if you give them the right and enough gifts speaking to them also helps\n\nGame Play: 7/10\nThe game is based around the 6 origins stories this forms a basic plot for the story to come this also includes a basic tutorial on how to play I think personally they don't tell you enough they should give you more information on the tactics. Speaking of tactics you can command you're companions to do as you wish. The attacking animation on this game is so bad a repetitive most of the abilities look very similar.\n\nDifficulty: 8/10\nThis game is quite a hard game I won't recommend it to anyone with anger issues if you haven't played a RPG before this would be a good place to start. The bosses in this game are actually challenging they are even harder if you put it on hard or nightmare if you decide to play on these difficulty's then be warned friendly fire is on. The achievement aren't really that difficult there is one or two but what game doesn't have these.\n\nGraphics 6/10\nThe graphics in this game aren't that great on this I notice at one point in the awakening that the texture were missing for the dwarf wouldn't spoil who they are but there face textures were missing this effected the dialog because on his head all I could see was his ginger hair and beard this was very annoying especially for important scene cuts. Because I didn't know who he speaking to and I couldn't see his reaction to some dialog choices\n\nEntertainment: 8/10\nThe game is addictive once you've got into it and will make you want to do multiple play-throughs. Most of the game is fun but there are a few bits in the game which make it boring like the Landsmeet it is a boring part but all you do have to do is skip through most of the dialog choices all in all this game will take up many hours of your life.\n47/60\n4.2","March 14, 2015","true","61.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The combat is fulfilling, fun and very varied, as you can choose to play different classes with completely different playstyles which branch out into different specializations with diverse results. The story is deeply engaging and full of content, the role of religion as an institution of society, idealism versus pragmatism, liberty versus security, the morals of war, among countless other topics, of which I'll spoil not a single one. Character interactions are very varied, some will want to talk your ear off while others will be much more introverted and demand a different type of interaction.\n\nIt's biggest and only Con --> The game is HARD as hell for beginners, sometimes a little unfairly as well since it has a learning curve that involves mastering all the mechanics and details related to combat and character leveling, even though the game allows for a lot of freedom even at the hardest settings, for example, my character is a rogue dual wielder and archer, a friend of mine plays a mage who is also an armor-clad greatsword-carrying warrior, both of which are perfectly possible even when the game encourages you to follow a more focused path. However, the game is still hard, start it on EASY because it's going to ask you to learn the mechanic and take them VERY seriously.\n\nAll in all, if you're patient and are willing to learn and strategize, you'll adapt quickly and have one of the most amazing role playing experiences ever made.

An epic tale which pits the forces of the darkspawn against all of race of dwarves, elves and men, and only the Grey Wardens constantly stand against the ever present threat. Meanwhile, you have the classic betrayal by those twisted by greed and distrust and abuse between the three races so that all are divided while the darkspawn grow ever stronger and threaten to engulf all the land with their taint.\n\nMy favorite part of the game though - the banter between the supporting characters that join your party throughout your quest. Alistair, Morrigan, and  Shale make for the best conversations. I was a little miffed about only being able to have 3 other companions in your party; thinking about what conversations I was missing put a slight damper on things.\n\nGameplay and combat were not the drawing features in the game being pretty typical for most RPGs these days, but I'm always a glutton for a good story.","December 18, 2010","true","17.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a fantasy adventure, thus far semi-open world (it might open up more, I'm not entirely certain yet).\n\nThe combat system is completely different from RPGs like the Elder Scrolls where you control your character's attacks and blocks and that's all you have to worry about.  Instead, it is a lot like Diablo (you can play the game with a Dark Souls style camera view for any non-combat sections but the camera should be top down like Diablo in combat) except you control all of your party instead of just one person.  In order to manage that combat, they give you a pause button which you will use to issue orders (will, not can, the game would be impossible without the pause system).\n\nAt first, I expected the pause system to break the immersion of the game and that breaking it would ruin the experience.  However, it doesn't really break the immersion too much and it adds a ridiculous amount of depth to the combat.  When fighting enemies, it doesn't feel like a dull grind.  You have to strategize positioning of your party members and coordinate timing of using abilities (which have cooldowns and other usage limits) and choose which enemies are best to kill first and which can be tanked until the end of the combat.  After combat, your companions heal so it's a bit like Pokemon in the sense that after combat you can stop by a Pokemon center.\n\nThe story thus far is engaging but I'm not far enough in to really give a fair description.  The graphics are decent for being a few years old and the characters only suffer from Uncanny Valley Syndrome a little bit (much unlike Oblivion where I felt creeped out by every NPC I came across).  So far, the characters are likable and have unique personalities.  But really it's the combat that's gotten me to write this review with only 6 hours logged.  It is too good to not recommend it.\n\nEdit:  Now 44 hours into this game and it really feels like it's dragging.  When you level up a character, they never really feel much stronger and combat has become a grind in the past 15 hours and feels like it interrupts the pacing of the game.  The first 30 hours I found the combat engaging so there is something good about the system.  The story is pretty slow going considering the urgency of the events of the story which makes it feel disconnected.  Supposedly a journey across a third of the world map takes 2 weeks and I made that several times over to buy supplies for crafting between 2 "dungeons".  It's a good game but there are definitely imperfections.\n\nEdit No. 2:  After a 3 month break I'm liking the game again.  It still seems slow (especially leveling) but I've gotten back into the loot system and have done a few sidequests to get some nice armor.  If it weren't for the sidequesting I've done, I could probably have the story beaten in 50 hours.  As it is I expect around 55 to 60 hours as my completion time.","July 9, 2014","true","75.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","2"

First time around I really enjoyed the game but I still wish the story was a little more mesmerizing. I don't mean to say that it sucks. It's a fine story and the world is decent enough. But it's nowhere near Mass Effect or Knights of the Old Republic. But unless you really love the combat or the story itself you wont want to play through the entire game more than once.

Far better than Dragon Age II, it is a game with almost infinite replayability (If that's a word).\nPros-\nDiverse Backgrounds- There are multiple different backgrounds and races. From a human whose noble family has died to a dwarven criminal, there are to my knowledge twelve distinct choices which influence your gameplay and choices later on.\nCompanions- The companions you meet on your journeys are likable and react to different actions the player commits. The diversity among races and backgrounds makes them feel more real and unique. On another note: This is a bioware game and [SPOILER Alert] you WILL end up banging someone.\nChoices- Unlike some other bioware games (Cough cough, Mass Effect 3), the choices you make significantly alters the game. The choices you make are not always easy either. You may take a while making up your mind.\nThe Dragon Age Universe- The world is fascinating and at times hard to understand. The mix of cultures and religions make it very likeable.\nReplayability- With the choices and backgrounds, you would be hard pressed to not be able to play 20 times with different gameplay. The endings, social interractions and gameplay styles differ, and about every thing else does too.\n\nCons-\nGameplay- The enviroment and combat are rather dull. This is however steriotypical of rps in this generation. The world is static and the combat is really boring until you find harder opponents, wih honestly takes awhile.\n\nIf you want to play an rpg this is the Mecca. If you want something with alot of exitement this may not be for you.\nP.S. Awakening is pretty much the actual sequal. Its a full length game and is better than Dragon Age II. It is an extension of the choices you make in Dragon Age: Origins.\n\n","September 1, 2014","true","9.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

(Different from Mass Effect where Shepard actually says something)\n4) LOTS of pausing and using items\n5) Your character always has the Jaden Smith look (Like he's worried about the end of the world or something)\n\nPros:\n1) Funny choices you can choose to do such as killing people for no reason, lying to them, or trolling them.

As with all Bioware games, there are some laughable design flaws and inconsistencies, but this game is a definite buy for anyone who loves immersion, good/variable story and  fantasy. Gameplay is hero/MMORPG style orientated and actully plays quite well although the combat itself gets repetitive in some areas. My only major complaint with this game is the somewhat long quests which force you to fight excessive numbers of enemies often for no reason. Additionally the difficulty of this game is definitely not for novices, and although not hard by any means is more difficult than your standard RPGs now. The cinematics and characters are well done for the game's age, and have aged very well (and I'm sure they will remain that way for years to come).

I've played it through way too many times and still keep going back for more!

Infact it's probably my favourite single player RPG. It manages to be engaging with the quality story we have come to expect from Bioware (ignoring SWTOR) but also with more customization beyond your character (like who is in your party) and tactics play a larger role with the ability to control your whole party and pause the game mid combat.

It would be fair to say that I had to start my game three times, being the third the one that didn't crashed my game, so I saw a glimpse of at least three origins.\n\nThe story is more than good. You have tons of lore, lots of dungeons (the Deep Roads are really big, though I've read before that they were impossible. They are not impossible, but it might take about 15+ hours for completion), and relationship development.\n\nI had to admit that having and developing relationships not only favours your party members' abilities, but also is interesting to develop.\n\nCombat: Well, having a tactical camera is awesome. Really awesome. Makes it easier to control all your party members, and making pausing the game an option, makes some battles easier.\n\nBut, battles are sometimes unproportional. You might sweep a boss easily, and be killed ten seconds later by a pack of wolves. So, be on your guard and save the game after every one or two battles.\n\nAlso, having in your characters ranged and melee weapons makes strategies come up easily. Even if you don't spend points in dexterity, makes your dwarf able to help instead of going into suicidal mode.\n\nTactics are good, when they actually work, other times they just get in your way.\n\nIn my opinion, this is a well balanced and inmersing RPG, with an inclination to battle tactics..

I am actually planning on playing a secondary playthrough but I am that kind of person that just can't enjoy a game that I already played, so I am waiting for a few more months to forget the entire plot of this game. But if it's your first time to play this game, seriously, if you want a character that's perfect with the ladies in-game...make a dwarf character.

The storyline while not neccesarily original will keep you interested long enough, it helps that most of your companions are interesting in their own right and you have the ability to experience different conversations and reactions depending on the chosen origin.\n\nDon't expect a spamfest combat system, this is a old school RPG with tactical combat, pauses, role creation, positional attacks everything is here and it's greatly rewarding for the meticolous player.\nNow this game is not perfect, as I said the story is not very original and the graphics leave a lot to be desired with low res textures and boring flat colors and design even tough it's a fantasy setting. And while the combat system is very rewarding it suffers (like most RPGs) once you get more loot and to a higher level, battles become to easy.\n\nAll in al an excellent RPG and a must buy for any RPG fan, specially old school ones.","July 11, 2014","true","195.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has also a deep valutation of the characters which are studied a lot in their actions and reactions. both origin and awekening are funny but do not buy dragon age 2 unless you are a fanboy (just like me) because it has the same map for almost every mission/stage of the game\ni'm very curious about inquisition go biowere!","February 11, 2014","true","48.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In hindsight, the theme of the game really doesn't stand out as much as, say Skyrim which has had its lore honed through many iterations and additions. It's a pretty generic throwback to pen and paper fantasy games (DnD?), standard stuff really. But  thats not really important. The thing about this game that stands out is its zomgperfectly crafted narrative. The story is engrossing, encaptivating, immersive, exciting (insert other adjectives), and Bioware does a fantastic job of molding a game around this narrative skeleton that both synergizes with, and doesn't get in the way of the real star of the show, the story. If the experience of Skyrim is that of a super capable Viking survivalist, which is no doubt every entertaining, Dragon Age makes you feel like a fantasy warrior Jesus, which, by the end of the game, will have you thanking Bioware for letting you become something you didn't even know you wanted to be.","February 5, 2013","true","64.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story, though cliche is very immersive with very in depth characters for you to interact with. Combat is strategic and overall fun. World feels rather small but very detailed. Character creation is a blast. Ending felt a bit dissapointing since it's text based instead of cutscene based. Make sure to play this before getting Inquisition!","July 7, 2014","true","40.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fully customisable... and its a long long game... that keeps you busy forever... certainly with all the DLC.\n\nSure, the graphics seem a bit outdated compared with modern games, but the story is strong, and the gameplay is cool. And it still looks a hell of a lot better than most so called "Modern"  but 2D CGA Colors graphics games out there.... Greenlight or INDI anyone ?...\n\nBesides.. The Nexus Mod community makes up for a whole lot that could be better compared with todays games, with hundreds of good quality mods, that enhance the aditive story line and gameplay even more. Making it infinately re-playable.\n\nForget Dragon age 2... buy this one, its way cheaper, and way better... I still play it from time to time... and i had it almost since release.. When its on sale.. its usually a give away.. if you like RPG's.. dont think.. just buy, you wont regret it.","May 10, 2014","true","847.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
