The randomized dungeons, items, armors, and weapons (which more or less serve as "classes") give plenty of reason to restart after dying to that damn dinosaur.\n\nMy rating: Since this game is EARLY ACCESS I'm going to hold off giving it a score until its finished.  But I  RECOMMEND  picking up Lost Castle if you are a fan of beat 'em ups!\n\n╩╩╦╩╦╦╩╦╩╩╦╩╦ Long Version ╦╩╦╩╩╦╩╦╦╩╦╩╩\n╦╩╦ Likes ╦╩╦\nIt's difficult, but not unfair. You will die. Probably a lot. It's sometimes going to be because you stupidly went for that last hit on the boss when you have no health left, other times you'll drink a potion and poison yourself. While bad things will happen, I never felt like it wasn't something I could have prevented.\n\nCouch co-op works wonderfully. The reason I picked up this title in the first place was after playing it with a friend; I'm really hoping they add online multiplayer (and possibly more than just two person co-op), but even as is the system is great!\n\nThe amount of different weapons/skills. Each weapon has a light attack , special attack, and heavy attack, though some weapons (like the musket) use the heavy attack as an evade instead. I really enjoy that you are able to run across different weapons of the same type that have differing stats/special attacks.\n\nCharacter/base development skill tree system. You basically earn "Souls" by killing things which you eventually sacrifice after your character dies. The souls are used to unlock the blacksmith, thief, and alchemist, as well as raise the base stats (attack, defense, move speed, etc.) of your character. It's not crazy complicated, but it serves the game perfectly.\n\nThe armor(s) and the aesthetics. I keep running across different types of armor I hadn't seen before. While most of what you find during one playthrough is rubbish except for one or two pieces, it's still enjoyable to see all of the different types/looks. I also really like that certain armor types pair up with certain weapons for a bonus.\n╦╩╦ Worth mentioning ╦╩╦\nLack of graphic options. This is not a problem for myself, but is worth pointing out. Outside of picking resolution and language (which is either English or simplified Chinese) there are no other settings.\n\nRandomized character appearance. You have zero control over what your character looks like but let's be honest, it doesn't really matter since they won't stick around for very long! Some of the randomized characters you get are hilarious looking.\n╦╩╦ Future hopes ╦╩╦\nMore weapon types! The amount of weapons/skills in the game already are a decent amount, but it's always good to have more choices.\n\nOnline multiplayer/expanded co-op. Either of these things would be nice (4 player co-op and/or online multiplayer) but are in no means needed for this to be an enjoyable game.\n\nA pet/companion system. This is just a random idea, but these kinds of games have always massively benefited from some sort of "collect more pets/companions with different benefits" depth. I personally think it'd be really cool to see.\n╩╩╦╩╦╦╩╦╩╩╦╩╦ Conclusion ╦╩╦╩╩╦╩╦╦╩╦╩╩\nFor an EARLY ACCESS game, Lost Castle surpassed my expectations. The combination of depth and randomization still has me interested in doing another playthrough just to make sure I've seen everything. Whether or not you have someone to couch co-op this game with, there is a lot of enjoyment to be had. I definitely recommend picking up a copy.\n\nI hope you found this review useful.

I recommend this game to anyone that likes rogue-lite beat-em-ups with some RPG elements.\n\nThe gameplay is very solid at the moment, I haven't ran into any issues yet.\n\nWhat makes this game great is the class system, combat, and level design.  The classes are bound to the weapons with their own skillset, for example, if you picked up a staff you are in essence a mage/wizard; you get to shoot magical energy. Or if you picked up a bow you are now an archer, or dual daggers then you are a rogue, etc..there are a lot of different weapons in the game, I haven't found them all, but am really excited to try them all out. Combat is fairly fluid, doesn't feel too "laggy" or "delay-ey".\n\nAlso each weapon has their own signature move and can vary. For example, if you picked up a great sword your special can be a earth shattering move which hits enemies in a line or it can be a charged dashed moving that pierces your opponent. And weapons have their own stats, so one might be better suited for defense while the other is better for offense..\n\nThere are different armor pieces that you can pick up that can change your character appearance and give different stats.\n\nWith this permadeath system there are some permanent features.  You have a skill tree where you can purchase passives that improve your character and these stay permanent even after you die and start over.  There is also an account/save slot level that you can gain, max is level 30.  I'm not really sure what character level does for you, but it is in the achievements.\n\nThe levels are somewhat randomized, I haven't died enough yet to see them all, but there isn't much of a variety in tilesets at the moment. Also there are different settings and enemy types which is awesome because you don't feel you're playing the same level over and over, it is refreshing. I mean if you play the game enough times then it might get to you, but as a new player it is very welcoming.\n\nYou also have item picks that you can use during your game, such as bombs and daggers.  You also have items that give passive effects such as increased damage, health, or special attacks.  Then you got your standard healing items such as an apple and banana.\n\nThe game is currently local co-op, but there will be online co-op when the game leaves early access.  So I would wait to purchase this if you want online co-op.\n\nI must note that the sound quality is not so great currently, sounds "watered-down" almost.  This will be updated though during early access as stated on the page.\n\nOverall my experience has been a great one and will continue to keep playing.  I definitely see this as one of my games that I rotate through.  The current price is worth it, you will definitely get your moneys worth.  I hope this review helps you decide to purchase this game or not.\n\nI will update my review as major updates get released.","February 5","true","11.6"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","16","16","0","0"

No, “THE WORLD,” summoning demons.  Well, his dark magic has a slight . . . should we say, complication. He managed to open the portal of “Devildom” and had the misfortune of meeting one of the demons itself! Misfortune for one is the fortune of the other. Demons took over the castle and brought valuable treasures from “Devildom” to store in it. WOW, as you are one of the finest treasure hunters in the Kingdom, it is an occasion not to be missed.\n\nLost Castle is a beat-em-up / rogue like type of game. You will take control of opportunistic treasure hunters who will fight a horde of demons and their minions through randomised dungeons.  You will start the game in the castle surroundings but quickly be taken prisoner by the goblins - this is basically a tutorial. Then you will appear in your prison cell at the goblins’ tower; luckily for you the door will be open.  Check out the other cells and meet the gate keeper. When you are ready he will open the gate for you.\n\nThis game is extremely good for an early access. As you fight your way through the dungeon, dispatching your enemies, you will earn souls, coins and other items by doing so. Also, make sure to destroy buckets, barrels etc within the level as they sometimes have items hidden in them. When you eliminate all foe in the level, you will earn a reward - a treasure chest full of goodies!\n\nIf you encounter the adversity of dying, don’t worry, you will respawn back in your prison cell with a totally new hero with an entirely new weapon (great fun)!  Before respawning, you will be able to use the collected souls at the Soul Sacrifice ability tree to strengthen your new hero.\n\nGreat content here, plenty of enemies, over 100 weapons (with they own special moves) and armour. 50 plus items and 30 plus potions. Just one little anecdote for you . . . I was fighting the first boss, I was in strife moving all around him to avoid his bombardment so in this case the essence is moving fast. Well, I had one item left, a potion with unknown effect (they are all a mystery, by the way). I used it, and the effect was . . .  A gastric attack! My hero needed to find a toilet, farting and pooing every few steps. Potions have a passive effect but this one was a death sentence for my hero!\n\nIn this version, you can play single player and local co-op mode. I believe you will have a multiplayer mode in the final release.\n\nThe graphics are well done and fun. The gameplay and the controls are good. Plenty of re-playability.\n\nPositives:\n~~~~~~~\n\n-	Good graphics\n-	Single player and local co-cop\n-	100’s of items, weapons and armour\n-	Randomize dungeons and hero\n-	Great re-playability\n-	Good price point\n-	Achievements and trading cards\n\nNegatives:\n~~~~~~~~\n\n-	No multiplayer as yet\n\nLost Castle is a little gem in the making!\n\n9/10\n\nKey provided by developer/publisher for review purposes. Any opinions expressed are entirely my own!\n\nMORE THE_CPT_FROGGY REVIEWS HERE\n\nFOLLOW THE CPT FROGGY CURATOR PAGE HERE\n","March 4","true","11.6"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","14","17","4","0"

Having only played FTL and binding of isaac I cant say if its the best rouge like game but its certainly worth your time if you like rouge likes. The price is easily worth it, You can be a warrior, mage or acher and each class has their own unqiue weapons to use along with spells and potions to give you a boost in damage, make you faster or even transform into a werewolf and take revenege on  everyone not fortunate enough to be a werewolf. When you die all the souls you have collected from your downed enemies can be used to give you a permantent boost in damage, hp, crit or better starting gear.\n\nPROS:\n\n+ Balls cheap\n+ Cute art style and music\n+ Lots of variations on gear, weapons and spells.\n+ LOCAL co op\n+ Multiplayer to be added\n+ Combat flows with basic attacks, heavy attacks and specials all tied to the weapon you have.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Small spelling errors but nothing major\n- Needs a NG+ mode\n- Cant save progress in current area and continue after exiting\n- Cant back track to buy items you saw but didnt have enough money at the time.\n\nAll in all its a great game for a great price and i recommend it!","February 21","true","5.3"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","79","15","19","3","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ctoefield/recommended/434650/","ctoefield","ctoefield","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ctoefield/","302 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI just finished playing some of the content of t his game. So far I've gotten to the third area (undead part of the game). I think that this game has the base of a really nice beatem up.\n\nGraphics:\n\nCharacters: Visual Fidelity isn't everything in a video game. You can make a game that has a strong appeal by having your own unique visual style by using higher quality illustrations to represent your graphics. I understand that the characters were made in a way to make them easy to mix and match elements but the problem is that the graphics are being done were on the far side of easy and the end result is that the characters look very generic as a result. Had I been the one making the decisions I would have looked to characters that  are somewhat super deformed so I could do some mixing and matching with some elements and at the same time offer more quality. (think metal assault).\n\nAnimations: I would have also made the attack animations have more of a z depth. Again, I totally understand that the idea to make the animations very horizontal and verticle were by design. They were probably a cost measure as well because it would be a lot easier to create. The problem is that people buy things that look good even if they don't pay a lot of money for it. If it doesn't look awesome that's going to be a problem.\n\nEqupment: The weapons are also hit or miss in terms of how they are illustrated. Everytime someone finds a new item it should not only make them excited by what stats are on the item, they should also be excited by how it looks. They should feel awesome when they see it. You have some weapons like the two handed sword that looks like the blade is made of stone that looks great. Then in the same breath,  you have items like the spears which look sub par.\n\nEnemies: Like the games equpment these are hit and miss to. You have some enemies like the skeletons in the third level that look good, then you have the goblins in the first level who look subpar. I get that gobins should be diminiutive creatures but they just aren't drawn very well. The same could be said for the evil ants in the first or second level as well.\n\nBackgrounds: The backgrounds for the levels are hit and miss but they surpisingly the better part of the games visuals. For instance, one of your screen shots has a nice looking wall with textures on it that has three alters in the middle of the room. That looks pretty good. Then you have some areas in the game(like the screen shot with the goblin tank boss) where the ball looks way to samy through the whole screen. I would recomend using larger tile sets that have "groups" of bricks togather. You should also create less division between each break in specific random areas of the wall. You should also look into discoloring the books in spots to or even have random diles where a coupble of the bricks are sticking out. This is going to have the effect of the walls to not look they are some sort of pattern, even though your using the same assets. If could also changed the lighting in different areas of the same level to create some visual interest.\n\nGameplay: I like the actual premise of the game. It feel like Rogue Legacy meets Castle Crashers, Having the different weapon types have a special move is a good touch. Hitting multiple enemies in one swing with some melee weapons make the game feel more enjoyable. You feel ilke a touch warrior.\n\nSkill Tree System. If your going to have a blacksmith skill tree that focuses on melee combat there should be talents that you can select that are weapon specific. I know that it's early access it's something to keep in mind. That goes the same for the other two skill tee categories.\n\nFinally, to say again what I said at the beginning, this game has the base of a really good beatem up. To generate some real attention the visuals need some reskinning as well as the other things I mentioned here. Good Luck.\n\n","February 11","true","1.1"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","1"

Riches await you!\nLost Castle is a superb 2D side scroller beat ‘em up which features some dungeon crawlers mechanics, as well as randomly generated dungeons.\n\nThe game begins when a wizard tries to use magic to become powerful enough to rule the world. He finds out that something has gone terribly wrong and ends up opening a portal to Devildom, the demon realm. You play as one of the treasure hunters that venture into Castle Harwood, where the portal appeared, in search of riches.\n\nAs soon as you start playing you’ll be captured by goblins and taken to the Goblin prison tower. This is the first zone out of 4 different zones. The overall enemy variety is pretty good, ranging from giant goblins, armored knights, archers, mages and drummers that make nearby enemies go berserk. There are also unique boss fights. Killing a boss causes new items to spawn and lets you proceed to the next zone.\n\nThe levels are divided into rooms that sometimes have more than one exit, allowing you to choose from various paths after killing all the enemies. By clearing a room you’ll spawn a chest that can contain food, gold, weapons, armor pieces, potions or even fragments that grant you passive bonuses. Be advised that potions have random properties, they can either give you strength or they can poison you.\n\nFood is used to heal you for differing amounts of HP. One funny thing I found is that when you eat a banana it will leave the banana peel on the floor and if someone walks over it, they will slip and fall on the ground. There are also traps scattered around the dungeons such as falling objects or spikes.\n\nAs you play you’ll collect gold and souls. Gold can be used in the dungeons to buy random items from merchants. Souls are one of the core elements of the game. After you die, you can spend them to buy permanent upgrades to all characters or to unlock more characters. The twist is that the souls that you don’t spend will be lost, so you’ll start each run with zero souls. You’ll also be able to free NPCs from the cells such as the Blacksmith, the Thief and the Pharmacist. These NPCs give you different benefits during your run. As with your heroes’ stats, you can also increase the benefits that they give you by spending souls.\n\nThere are various different types of characters, and at the start of each run you’ll be assigned a random one. I’ve played as a knight (slow but powerfull), as a rogue (low damage but fast), as an archer and as a mage. However, even if your character starts with these abilities, if you pick up another type of weapon, their abilities will change accordingly.\n\nOne minor complaint that I have is the fact that you are only presented with a description of an item before picking it up. After it is on your inventory there is no way to check what each item does. Maybe having an actual inventory to check this would be good.\n\nPros:Random dungeons and characters = very replayable\nPermanent progression\nTons of different weapons and armor\nChanging classe on the go\nControls great, low skillcap\nLovely cartoony visuals\nVery light on system requirements\nCons:Minor spelling mistakes\nNo online co-op (it does have local co-op]\nSomewhat poor sound effects\nNo inventory system to check what your items do\nOverall thoughts:\n\nLost Castle is a blast. I’m not usually a fan of beat ‘em ups but Lost Castle manages to capture the best elements of other games and turn them into an amazing experience. It is easy to play but difficult to beat and it offers a lot of replayability. It is a shame that it doesn’t have online co-op at the moment but hopefully that, along with more content, will become available before the final release. If you enjoy beat ‘em ups, roguelikes/roguelites, dungeon crawlers or side scrollers in general, do yourself a favour and check this game out!\n\nRating:\n\nI would rate Lost Castle an amazing 9/10.\n\nWant more recommendations?

It's somewhere between Rogue Legacy and Golden Axe. It's hard but fair. Different items have different playstyles, there are some interesting enemies. Pricing policy is fair, the game has received regular updates so far and developers seem to read the Community forums.\n\nInstead of classic pros and cons, let me list few random things I liked:\n\n- Eat some bananas, throw peels around. Proceed into glorious battle, slip on the banana peels, lose HP.\n- Eat some bananas in the heat of battle, throw peels around, and lol a foes slip on them. Also, murder them before they get up.\n- Finish the stage with just a few hp just to watch the reward chest fall on your head and kill you.\n- There's a fart potion... which made me fail my best run in an undescribably hilarious way.\n- There's a Dragon weapon with "Anything can be a weapon" description. It's a dragon that works like shotgun. Daaayum, can't argue with that.\n\nOverall I love it and I look forward to more content and polish.","March 17","true","18.5"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The idea is there and if you have money to spare you should grab it but if you're on a tight budget wait for a while.

They’re calling that beta access, and for the way it plays I’d honestly say that it’s damn near ready for release aside from the occasional bug and… it still have some memory/duplication things which can cause the game to either lock or drag your system down. There’s some technical things behind that, but I don’t know enough about raw game design to get into it, I just know that it involves the engine, the particles/projectiles, and something that happens when you accept an item that can cause it to replicate indefinitely. Like I said, most devs would consider it’s current version an EARLY alpha.\n\nLet’s talk about the gameplay. The raw gameplay, what they’re attempting to achieve, works. It works well. In my opinion, it takes a lot of its aesthetic choices from something similar to Castle Crashers with a slightly more serious twist. Not much more serious, but still more serious as the game progresses. And it’s a good look for the game. It’s a fun aesthetic. Things are colorful. You’re colorful, the enemies match the color tone of the levels which are usually… not vibrant, but they pop. The (oh god I’m sorry art majors if I misuse this) shades they use are bright. Not bright enough to be distracting, but bright enough to give everything a bit of a light-hearted feeling.\n\nI was talking about the gameplay, sorry. It’s simplistic, but not in a bad way. There are controls or mechanics that I wish the game itself had, but remember, version 0.06. The fact that things work well at this stage says a lot about the skill of the developers. You have a character who finds themselves in a dungeon. Pretty stereotypical as far as beginnings go. You begin with a random low-tier starting weapon and can unlock the ability to find other, higher-tier items early on. Each weapon type has it’s own unique moveset, and there are I believe six different weapon types in total: Sword and Board, Greatsword, Dual Swords, Bows, Shotguns (Muskets, whatever), and Staves.\n\nEach weapon type comes with its own set of strengths and weaknesses and they’re varied enough to suit individual preferences, which is surprising provided that each weapon has 3 moves. Total. Basic, Alternate, and Special. Basic is your swing, the button you mash to kill the things. Alternate varies between weapons. It can be a charged swing, a shield block, a piercing shot, etc. Then there’s the specials. Specials are shared across most weapon types. You obviously can’t perform a spear charge with a bow, or summon a crystal with a sword, but many of the special abilities are shared between weapons. Each weapon has a type, which in turn dictates its special ability. Again, these are varied enough that even in their current state that each weapon can provide players with enough variety to find at least one to suit them. I’m partial to frenzy myself, but I also enjoy being directly in my enemy’s face, or chasing the enemy ranged units down shouting, “FIGHT ME!”\n\nIt claims to be a rougelike, meaning simply that progress is reset each time you die and you always begin at the beginning and attempt to reach the end. It’s closer in its current state to a rogue-lite since it allows you to make upgrades to your adventurers after each death, and the upgrades themselves are permanent. This may change in the future; the developers could implement a true roguelike mode whenever more content is implemented, but for now the rogue-like aspect is appreciated. The game itself still has a decent chance of failure, which to me makes it more fun. A game without a failure state is just… dull. Uninteresting to me.\n\nAs you progress through the levels, you can discover various items for your character. These include new weapons, new armor, consumables, passive stat upgrades in the form of crystals, and items that add modifiers to both your character and your attacks. There’s a whole lot of potential here, especially considering EVERYTHING STACKS. Traditionally speaking, this has created problems as more content and modifiers are added, but for now you can freeze, burn, poison, knock down, set enemies ablaze, and others I’m sure I’m missing all simultaneously. You’d think this would make the game incredibly easy, but the enemies actually scale well between levels.\n\nThe aforementioned upgrades aren’t necessary to complete the game, but let me tell you without any defensive upgrades by the third or fourth level you’d better be damn good at avoiding attacks otherwise you risk losing a third of your max health from a decently strong mob. There are some brief invulnerability frames after taking damage, but they last approximately half a second, so they’re enough for you to not get stun locked and that’s about it.\n\nSpeaking of, hit detection is a bit peculiar. I’m not saying it’s terrible, you stand near the thing and swing your weapon you’ll usually hit the thing, but you can tell that they’re still working out the hit/hurt boxes for the game. You’ll definitely be confused a few times because some attacks are larger than they seem and some you can practically stand in and not be damaged.\n\nThe soundtrack matches the game very well, but simultaneously it’s incredibly repetitive and not at all memorable. I played it today and I can’t remember a single background track from it. Again, as content is added, I’m anticipating more songs, but at the moment the soundtrack is far and away the weakest aspect to this …beta? Who the ♥♥♥♥ releases a game at sub .1 as a beta?\n\nI have high hopes for this game, it has a lot of potential. Don’t misunderstand me, it’s definitely not for everyone, especially if you dislike losing, and as a beta it still has its fair share of issues. However, there’s a lot that the developers can do with the rogue-lite system, more weapons and items to add, more levels, branching advancement paths, new room types, environmental effects, and even secret content. This game is far from complete but if you’re looking for something cheap that’s challenging but fairly enjoyable, then I’d suggest picking this up. The devs deserve the money. They’ve made a damn good open sub-beta-but-not-an-alpha.\n\nI hate score systems, but there’s a streamer who rates games by hours of enjoyment vs price and I’ve already payed less than a dollar an hour for this game, and I imagine that differential will only grow as the game does.","February 25","true","14.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Gameplay is quite simple, you bash the sh*t out of creatures with a random char/class. You progress by investing into persistent perks so you eventually make it through each of the randomly generated stages. There's definitely some similarities to Rogue Legacy and hell, I want to see more BoI similarities, too, please! More random items that change the entire gameplay by enabling me to jump, fly or even add nonsense skills. It could be a little harder, too. However, love it.

I did enjoy it for a few hours, but after that it falls into the boring repeat cycle that so many roguelike games can get caught in.\nPROS:\n-Good combat system. It's not super-complicated, and takes a little bit to get used to and get proficient at. Lots of enemies to keep you busy, though this can easily turn around and become a massacre of you instead.\n-Nice level design. It's not complicated in design, or hard to navigate. Randomly-generated dungeon rooms make the experience different every time you play.\n-Overall decent gameplay. There are a few kinks to work out, but it's pretty solid as it stands.\nCONS:\n-Game gets repetitive after an hour or two. Despite it's random generation factor, Lost Castle gets boring after a while. On the rare occasion that you can get past the place you were stuck at before, the next area is always almost guarunteed to get you killed. Ultimately, it's kinda a grinding game.\n-grammatical/spelling issues. This isn't a super big deal, but it is kinda a pet peeve for me anyway.\n-some boss fights are extremely difficult to complete solo, or even with a friend. There is a boss who surrounds himself with ranged minions, and can attack as well. It's extremely difficult to even get close to him, if you use a melee weapon. Even with a ranged weapon. I get that this is a roguelike, and is meant to be more challenging than the normal stuff, but this was a factor that kinda killed the game for me.\n-glitches and bugs make this game almost impossible to play, at times. There is a bug that will not allow you to pick up items from the treasure chests, so it almost guaruntees your death.\n-odd hit register system. Many times, I've been dodging an attack, and the game still registers that I was hit, even though I was out of the way. It really kills the game for me. I don't see how it can function as a good roguelike if the hit recognition system is funky.\nAltogether, if you like the look of the game, and think it's something you'll enjoy, go for it. Personally, I found it was fun for the first few hours, but after that, it kinda spiraled down into a grind for soul points to level up my character so I could stand half a chance against the bosses. Just gets repetitive and boring after a while. Co-op is recommended to play this game.","May 9","false","27.2"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","4"

The reviews here made me take the plunge without looking too much into it because everyone seemed to like it, but they never seem to really specify why they like it. The game generally suffers from poor production quality. Perhaps the design studio was on a very low budget, but the whole game seems like a poor attempt at being a castle crashers, rogue-like mix.\n\nI really haven't played the game enough to comment on the gameplay because the other factors contributed to such a bad taste in my mouth after playing the game for such a short amount of time that I could not give it another try. The main turn-offs for me are as follows: Intro to the game and the story as a whole, grammar issues everywhere, and art style.\n\nFirst off, the story is just silly. I can't tell if it was actually trying to be funny or not and this is simply due to the terrible grammar in this game. It seems that all of the text in the game has been translated from another language using Google Translate alone and no spell-checking. I can't understand the story, but it seems to be just as encapsulating as most other roguelikes: you must be continuously sent off to your peril in order to claim more demons' souls and defeat a big bad guy that some magic person accidentally unleashed from its hellish depths who is now wreaking havoc on everyone in the land. It actually almost seems like a really cheap and horrible copy of the story to Demons' Souls (but no one knows that story anyway). This combination of horrible story and even worse story-telling leads to a laughable atmosphere that does not make you feel like you are playing a game that takes itself seriously.\n\nThe only thing that makes these points worse is the super lazy art style. They went for repetition wherever they could place it with a lack of depth. It looks like a flash game that you would find online really. This alone made the game feel stale to me. No effort in story, no effort in art.\n\nThe cherry on top is just how HORRENDOUSLY ugly I find the character design. This might not be as big of a factor for anyone else and this will probably make me sound silly or childish, but this character design makes me almost as angry as when I see Gnomoria on the front page: A game which I am absolutely certain would sell more if the image they used to advertise the game wasn't that of the ugliest piece of ♥♥♥♥ anyone could fathom. The problem with this game is the opposite of Gnomoria: the ugly characters aren't on the front page, but plague the entirety of the game with their stupid neckless, head-in-front-of-shoulders design. This is almost every character and it is annoying.\n\nNormally I would keep such comments regarding the art style of a game out of a review and leave the judging to the individual interested in the game, but I state this here in this review because, first of all, I had no clue how bad it was until after I bought the game, and also, because it is not simply the art style, but the lack of ingenuity with said style that leads me to believe the artist(s) that developed this game are lazy.\n\nNow, I don't know why I didn't understand how bad the graphics would be, but I think it ought to be pointed out: I checked out the screenshots and thought it looked cool, but when it was loaded up in full-screen it looked so ugly to me.\n\nOkay, so this game has some critical failures that make me unable to recommend the game, but there are some redeeming factors. The game is challenging, it seems like it would take some real skill to become good at the game. It is kind of a cool system to have each weapon have its own unique moveset, just like the Souls games, but I personally find this mechanic unpleasant here as if you grow to like one weapon a lot, the only way to play with it again is to find it again, which appears to be random. Though the "talents" system, akin to Rogue Legacy's upgrades system, is quite bland, it is at least present and offers greater replay value. The abilities and different weapons did not seem too varied, and neither did the armor, but at least you have a decent pool of options, and of course I wasn't very far into the game anyway.\n\nThis game is good if you're looking for a lightweight game you can enjoy with a friend. At the time of writing this, the game is about 400mb. If you don't expect your games (or their developers) to be incredibly serious and you're looking for a fun, kind of quirky, castle-crashers-esque rogue-like, then give it a shot. If you're looking for the next big rogue-like with innovating mechanics, move along.","February 25","false","2.8"," 14 of 33 people (42%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","42","14","33","4","0"

Really fun combat, lots of random weapons to find along your journey, they constantly change and you unlock new ones, also the runs are never the same and you never know what to expect and some bad ♥♥♥ tunes. It's pretty much a hack and slash game minus the need for hours of grinding. Very simple, great movement, hitboxes and control, I'd  would like to also mention it has a very nice balance of difficulty.\n\nThe only thing i've disliked is that most potions seem negative and they are always uknown. I think It would be nice if once you've drank a certain type you learn its effects, but it's not really a big deal though. The farting potion was a funny discovery, I had a great set of items and got pretty far, was low hp, drank the potion in hopes of some healing, but instead got uncontrollable fart syndrome. I walked into my cloud and died. My own beef betrayed me... It was so funny I couldn't even be mad.

Due to length restrictions, deleted some of the original content, leaving only the equipment evaluation part, for the time being as weapon guide.\n\n-- -- -- --\n\nI first talk about the whole experience for Lost Castle: very good against the flu, moderate difficulty (for children should be mixed with a large arcade is not difficult), but only a few rich useful weapons, equipment, props, design more excellent monster (the latter is the last two BOSS), see the face the stochastic system and the system of sacrifice dish of chicken savior. Because I have not played other RL games, so it is used as a horizontal plate at the pass of the game, is pretty good.\n\nTalk about the advantages and disadvantages of all kinds of weapons, one of which is the core of the game:\n\n1 double knife, super high attack speed, long combos (which means more slowly to break the body, and the greater utilization of weapons (enchantments). The special technology is sprint, in my opinion is the special technology of the most outstanding in this game. Although the attack over a short distance, but the use of good sprint skill, double knife is very powerful. BOSS hit the fastest weapons, but also my most love weapons. Run in figure A, BOSS war S.\n\n2 guns. Large attack distance, fast attack speed and PA broken body. The special technology to take the floor after the jump, feeling useless, can be added to hide some of the projectile combo. A simple weapon of violence. In the hands of novice veteran should be an artifact. Run in figure S, BOSS war A+.\n\n3 sword and shield. The same is fast attack speed and PA broken body, attack distance, feel like castrated version of pike. The special technology to shield, like a chicken ribs, the shield can not completely block after damage can only reduce injury, and was hit hard straight. Under the proposed changes to the shield, otherwise it really made the staff skills. Run in figure A, BOSS war A.\n\n4 sword, with almost spear attack distance, attack speed and PA broken body slow. But because of the excellent range, for PA broken body demand is not so high. The special technology Pactrometer attack, like a chicken ribs, the holding time is too long, the range of damage and co.. As a special skill is to be modified. Sword class skills are relatively good, a lot of great damage skills are very good. Run in figure S, BOSS war A.\n\nThe following are long-range weapons more vulnerable, because I use are not many, we briefly talk about.\n\nRun chart: > > gun bow staves, BOSS and musket staves: bow > >.\n\nIn the first two compared low, long-range weapons still can. After the two pass then almost have to rely on more powerful skills, only by the attack can hit you. BOSS war is still the only bully the first two off, because the output efficiency is too low and the performance of BOSS is much lower than that of melee weapons.\n\nThe staff of the awful Pugong, staff almost can play CD stream, personally think that a weapon near the chicken ribs. I think the next developer staff how to consider.\n\nThe last point is about the props, did not find what the special needs of missiles, but these pylons scarecrow is still of some use. Hope to strengthen the next missile, every time is flying everywhere but I bother to pick it.\n\n-- -- -- --\n\n2016/2/22 update\n\nIt took little time to experience the next two weeks, still no clearance, have to say is two weeks of descent (African how?) Double test and technology. Because a week almost is playing in melee, comments a friend mentioned that bows the feasibility, and the key to experience ranged weapon.\n\nBefore the start, you must first clear two week in the end is what? That is the "monster high attack +BOSS + Monster nausea (combination) swift". So in my opinion, flexible weapons can survive in two weeks. The better under high pressure.\n\nTo say is flexible, we naturally think of the special technology for sprint double knife. But the double flexible is not limited to sprint technology, Pugong shot a quick and flexible embodiment, see timely close hand and escape a factor is very important in charge or other strange sprint ranged attack. But because the attack distance is too short, and not very strong AOE skills (a crystal impression, resulting in double wall) in the two week in need of knife position and operation of a large number, so I don't think it is the most suitable to accompany us through two weeks.\n\nThen another flexible weapons in two weeks off the lead out. It is a ranged weapon in the critically acclaimed musket. I had a week to review criticized long-range weapons compared to melee weapons is too slow, the efficiency of BOSS is too low. In the two week is extremely squeezed living space of melee weapons, have no a week head station Lu capital, the advancing speed is also greatly reduced, which makes the gun position in my heart, a top. So in the end where guns? 1 shot a hard straight. 2 single high power. 3 excellent range and AOE ability. 4 good jump skills. 5 silly, ye will jump shot! BOSS can adjust the position and make personal jump continuously in the jump, give full play to the grandpa Mao guerrilla theory gun, for the first time I feel at ease at two weeks (best play to the final BOSS). If you hit the earthquake shoes, please be sure to experience a monster in the heap of joy jump shot Pleasure.\nThe rest of the weapons, in two weeks in the eyes of more outstanding performance I think is the sword. The giant sword has a strong AOE skills (shock wave LV3, saber blade, trial (?) It is very powerful, and his normal attack skills) can easily break people blame submachine charge (people charge blame PA body only in leap when the sword can easily split the distance away when he jumped to interrupt him), so I think he is, for two weeks. The most simple the utility of melee weapons.\n\nLong in my opinion has not changed, but the sword and shield at fourth is very bad, if not get physics holy sword, the best in fourth before to replace him.\n\nBow up slightly in the two week of the destination, the reason is the same with guns. But its special attack before it did not shake than long guns, displacement skills, not jump shot, so it was completely covered by the light gun. But most of the time it's performance can go and melee weapons.\n\nThe last is the staff, staff were still. I have tried the possibility of staff, finally found only meteorites (with CD flow teleport pull + drag CD, meteorite skills can be used, full screen seckill) running speed is not too slow, but BOSS is still very slow. (in fact, the wolf people can also play, special attacks to the vampire werewolf, the survival ability of ♥♥♥♥ fly, but this seems to be the only weapon to trigger a special room to get another werewolf) crystal staff skills is also very good, but I got the crystal rod remain blinking, BUG do not know or design mistakes. Have got the students to tell me about.\n\nFinally give you tips a little skill.\n\nThe following 1 lines really don't learn!\n\nIn the final 2 skills to explore the road of not learning, according to popular experiences, special scene shops and slots which appear in the above and below.\n\n3 high grade, BOSS get more soul this skill is very helpful for you to upgrade the level of.\n\n4 don't add low-level skills, because the game in each level, all the skills required for the soul to +2, based on advanced skills needed on the soul itself, if the high level to go to school, will lead to 200 may make a soul. So I suggest that the end point of three chest three weapons to put a layer of ultimate skill point full back before learning skills. It is because I am wrong later led to high skill upgrade progress abnormal slow.\n\n5 banana peel fell invincible, many times are magical.

Lost Castle is, however, randomly generated, rogue-lite, and is in Early Access. If you are a fan of Castle Crashers and rogue-lites, this game is made for you! Now, on the hand of being Early Access, this can be taken as good or bad to many. This game, I will admit, is not near completion yet, but the local co-op, randomly generated dungeons, and item enchantments really make this game pull up for its current problems in its beta state. The soundtrack can get repetitive, but overall the RPG leveling and semi randomization holds the game up to other games like Castle Crashers. The asking price of $7.99 is well deserved.\n\n\n---Review---\nLost Castle has numerous features, including local co-op, randomly generated dungeons, enchanted armor and weapons, and an RPG styled leveling system. All of these, however, are wonderful except for the length of the game/dungeons. Each dungeon lasts 4 to 10 rooms from my experience, which wouldn't be an issue if it wasn't for the amount of dungeons there are. There are currently only 4 dungeons in the game. When finished, however, Lost Castle will likely have far more, but if this makes you doubt replayability despite the semi-random rooms, items, and bosses, remember that the game is still in Early Access. I will add to this, the soundtrack is currently quite small and can be very repetitive. Some bosses share the same theme, and most of the songs are near a minute long.\n\nLost Castle can be very fun if you have a television, two controllers, a friend, and enough USB ports to have the controllers plugged in! This game shines the most in co-op, as the game becomes harder due to resource sharing. Along with this couch co-op, you have Nightmare Mode once you beat the four dungeons that are currently in the game. Unlike most games, Nightmare Mode is truly a nightmare. Nightmare Mode gets incredibly difficult for the casual to average gamer, however. Nightmare Mode can be quite similar to how difficult to Insane mode is in Castle Crashers, although Castle Crashers is easily harder in Insane mode.\n\nOn the note of difficulty, Lost Castle can be pretty difficult if you don't know what you are doing. Nightmare Mode, however, turns this diffiulty up to where even the goblins can dish out some pain if you let them hit you. Lost Castle has a pretty straight forward difficulty curve. It can be fun for both casual and somewhat hardcore players. In its current state, the game does not last too long if you get good enough gear to make it to the end and it can be too easy for the absolute hardcore.\n\nDoes Lost Castle show promise? Yes, it does! Lost Castle, when completed, would likely become the next Castle Crashers. Lost Castle even has a few poop potions that I have come across! Lost Castle is a must for anyone who loves beat-em-ups in the Castle Crashers style. Lost Castle does have the issue with length and a lack of randomization once you've played it long enough. Randomization, however, affects a massive number of things as you would see when playing. The areas, bosses, items, and even your own character are randomized. This means that you may become Paul Bunyan one time, and the next, you become Hatsune Miku. I have seen characters who looked like both, so the generation is pretty hilarious.\n\nIn beta v0.08, I would rate Lost Castle a 7/10.\nOnce completed, the devs should have fixed and added much more content compared to its current state. It's asking price of $7.99 is a great value for a game of this kind, and I highly recommend anyone who is a fan of the genre. If you doubt the replayability of this game, click that big "Follow" button up by the images. You'll see when an update that you are interested in or the game is completed. Lost Castle is a truly solid beat-em-up rogue-like game that is perfect for couch co-op.","March 14","true","22.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm going to take classes to learn chinese so I can play this game again.\n\nUnless someone knows how to turn it back.

Certain weapons seem to have an advantage mainly 2h swords and spears seem to double hit enemies. Trees in map 2 have sometimes started tossing bombs at me from across the map right when i enter a new section.but these are minor issues for an early access id give this game a 8/10 and would recomend it to anyone who loves shovel knight, rogue legacy, shovel knight.","February 9","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is most unussual in that in most games you start off with a nice easy tutorial and the game gradually gets harder.  In lost castle it's the opposite.  You start off with nothing and you will find the first half hour very difficult but then with each death you get mana points to upgrade.  So after an hour of playing it then becomes very enjoyable slaying all the beasts that you previously had so much trouble against at the start of the game.  I found this very rewarding to see this progress being made as each playthrough got easier and easier.  In the 4 hours I have sunk in I have so far got to the 3rd world out of 4.  Im sure more will be added as the game is in early access.\nThe game then went from an 8 out of 10 to a full on 10 out 10 instantly when all of a sudden the weapon of my dreams appeared.  I walked into the main starting area and there was the ultimate weapon waiting for me, begging for me to take it infact.  It wasn't a rocket launcher or a chainshaw oh no.  It was a giant fish.  Yes you heard me right a fish!!  I was like a little kid at xmas as my face lit up.  I grasped the 2 foot beauty with both hands and charged into the dungeon to unleash hell.  I have to say I have had few gaming moments as satisfying than slapping everyone silly with a wet fish.  If only there werent laws in place in the real world to prevent this from being a reality.  I could think of at least half a dozen people I would love to club to death with a fish.  Well club to death is maybe a little harsh but certainly half a dozen people I would like to stick in A and E overnight using this as my method for achieving that.\nAnyway back to the game, I love it and have no hesitation in strongly thumbing this one up.","April 29","true","4.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
