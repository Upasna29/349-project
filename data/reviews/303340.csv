I was immediately reminded of some older Flash games that I had played years ago but the difference was I actually enjoyed playing Concursion for more than a couple minutes.\nI have been replaying the levels after completion to go back for the time achievement and the extra Gem Shards that are hidden or hard to pick up, so I can effectively get two/three times the playtime for my money!  (So far I have completely wasted my Friday night and Saturday, ‘cause that’s cool)\n\nI have found myself replaying some levels incessantly, ala SuperMeat Boy, to try and best the time challenge (and also taken a couple breaks because of extreme frustration).  It also has slight puzzle elements that were integrated just enough to not get annoying or change the game.  Sometimes the Maze (PacMan) levels really got in the way of the gameplay, but those seemed to be kept to a minimum.\n\nI loved that some story elements were included and the story itself, but I would have liked to see more, more voice work and MORE story to tie everything together.  Essentially the worlds get “broken” apart and we are running around in them, but the story itself did not need to seem like it was also a little broken.\n\nI thought the music was awesome, it helps the transition elements of gameplay a lot and is generally fun to listen to even when you are replaying a level over and over, I did not find myself muting the music or replacing it with my own, as I often do playing most games.\n\nUnfortunately, I disliked the artwork as much as I loved the music, but as this is a first attempt from Puuba Studios I figure you have to choose where your money and effort go to.  I did eventually become accustomed to it, and I did like how many of the bosses were animated.\n\nI would love to see this game re-skinned and released for PSN (or Xbox Live) with some extra DLC, I would buy it again.  Oh, and how about a Level Editor? I would love to remake some SMB levels with some of these weird tricks thrown in!\n4.5/5 -- Because of the Artwork and my interest being piqued but not satisfied by the story I docked half a point, otherwise a perfect game to play for as long as you have and be able to walk away and pick up again later.","June 7, 2014","true","24.7"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","25","34","0","0"

The premise of the game is that the universe is being torn apart, and there are rifts all over each level which, as you enter them, lead to a different world, which turns you into a different hero with totally different powers.\n\nThe 5 characters you play as are a knight, which is very similar to super mario, a ninja, complete with a sword, double jumps and wall hangs, a space ship which leads way into shmup style levels, a little bull thing that plays like pac-man and an astronaut who has a jetpack but no means of attack.\n\nIndividually all 5 styles are handled well, the controls for each character are very tight and I never once blamed a death on the controls.  Each character, on its own, is very fun to play, but where this game shines is the way the characters are integrated into one anothers level.  You may think it is just a gimmick, but the reality is that the way the genres cross each other is brilliant and the further you get into the game, the more wild the cross overs become.\n\nThe difficulty curve in this game is handled extremely well, this is not an easy game, and you will die a lot but the difficulty progression is very smooth.  The game starts out easy enough as you play a few introductory levels to learn the characters and as you progress the levels and the cross-overs between them get increasingly more challenging, but you never feel overhwhelmed, nor do you feel that anything is cheap.  The beauty of this game is that some things will seem insurmountable when you firts look at them but before you know it you are completing insane challenges like a pro.\n\nThere are also 3-4 gems in each level, very similar to the 3 big coins in the new super mario series.  SOme gems are right in your face but tricky to access and others are cleverly hidden, obtaining all these gems is important to the story, but more importantly you will have a blast trying to collect all of them.  This game is also sprinkled with some humorous moments that pays homage to some old games, be sure to read the titles to every level.  The story here is also well done, it is a platformer so don't expect anything crazy but there is more of a story than your average mario clone and even a funny little twist that I will not spoil for you here.\n\nI cannot recommend this game strongly enough, if you are a gamer you owe it to yourself to give it a try, it is unlike anything you have ever played or probably ever will play.  It is an absolute blast from start to finish and I cannot think of a single thing in this game to complain about.\n\n10/10","August 16, 2014","true","9.6"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","17","21","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tech-Gaming/recommended/303340/","Tech-Gaming","Tech-Gaming","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tech-Gaming/","2441 products in account","The old cliché “variety is the spice of life” has been the driving concept behind in a number of noteworthy games. Early coin-ops such as Tron or Gorf were conceived around the notion that an amalgam of four or five different diversions could be a bigger draw than merely offering players a single game. Kid Chameleon for the SEGA Genesis/Megadrive tweaked the idea further by offering a protagonist capable of transforming into a variety of forms- each controlling remarkably differently and having their own distinctive set of abilities. The latest title to be built around this design philosophy is Concursion- the inaugural title from Los Angeles-based indie studio Puuba.\n\nA short introductory cinematic sequence divulges the game’s retro-minded ambitions, as a princess is abducted by a reptilian interloper. Fearing apprehension by a party of pursuers, the scaly antagonist covers his tracks with a shower of emerald-colored crystals which trigger the appearance of the game’s eponymous dimensional-portals. Beyond the obvious reference to Miyamoto-san, Concursion flaunts its appreciation for videogame history across a procession of referential humor, with stage names which parody renowned games. The game’s overworld also draws inspiration from Nintendo- with a succession of stage maps much like Super Mario Bros. 3. But where the plumber-protagonist frequently had access to branching level paths, Concursion stubbornly extends a linear trajectory.\n\nMore: http://www.tech-gaming.com/concursion-review/","June 24, 2014","true","1.3"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","0"

I LOVE platformers. If I could gather up every platformer there was and play them all, I would. And the artwork is the kind that I like, smooth, high quality, but simple.\n\nI picked up the demo during the speed run competition and got like 17th or something (I didn't really try for very long), so I decided to buy the game instead, and let me tell you, it is the most worthwhile £7 I have ever spent. For a game with as much replay value as this, I would pay closer to £50.\n\nI then played the game and enjoyed the fact that it did have a difficulty curve, but I never felt like it was too difficult. Then the music. Where do I begin with the music? This game has one of the best Soundtracks ever, it's better than games by massive developers who spend 5 years developing one level of a game.\n\nAll in all, this game is probably my favorite to be released this year, and I look forward to more games from Puuba.\n\n10/10","September 26, 2014","true","39.6"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

It's kind of a 2D platformer, but then not really 50% of the time. Mostly because there are certainly entirely levels where you play a shmup, fly around with a jetpack, and play pacman for -reasons-. It certainly is, though, quite an enjoyable experience with a few flaws.\n\nThe game's biggest strength is its variety; almost every level tries something new, so if you didn't like the last level, well, you don't have to worry because odds are you won't see another like it for the rest of the game. And the game is a pretty decent length too, with 70 levels/bosses across 7 worlds. There's just so many creative ideas here, enough to fill two or three games, but crammed in to one to keep the game constantly fresh longer than any other game I can think of has. It's not the most difficult game, but it's not the easiest game either, and 100% completion definitely takes a bit of effort.\n\nIt's not entirely perfect though; it does, visually, not look great, and I worry that people will judge its overall quality as a result of this. The dance thing at the end of levels, especially, is... ow. Painful. But the graphics don't really matter if the gameplay is enjoyable, in the end. And the game only stumbles there occasionally. Personally, I felt the checkpointing in some levels/bosses was not sufficient (at least for normal mode; hardcore mode is totally fine though since that's the point; but some levels where the checkpointing was identical and normal and hardcore tended to be the issues here for me). The bosses also tend to fall flat half of the time; any bosses not fought with the ship or ninja, especially, as you have 2-3 hits and little to no chance of recovering from a hit. They're all creative in their own way but I personally felt some bosses (especially the final boss and its abysmal third phase) needed a checkpoint; only one single boss in the game actually has checkpoints, out of 7. I also felt there was an overreliance on autoscrolling/forced pace levels. Autoscrolling only works if the player has to struggle to keep up (which is the case in some levels, but not most of them). Otherwise it becomes tedious to replay the same segment at the same pace when you fail.\n\nI wouldn't call it a perfect game by any means but I had a ton of fun with it and am looking forward to the bonus levels the devs have mentioned coming in the near future, and I'd certainly recommend you check it out; more than anything else it's unique in a good way.","August 23, 2014","true","17.2"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","0"

Concursion, however, takes the concept of "mashup" to a whole new insane sphere by jamming as many as five disparate genres into the same field!  There is no neat pick-and-choose here; you must actively guide the behorned Questy Guy from one sparkle-bordered genre zone to the next, and while he retains his momentum in the crossing, his appearance and moveset alter completely -- as do the characteristics of any enemy that happens to drift over!  Sometimes these shifts occur with such dizzying speed that it almost seems like madness at first, but a meticulous method always becomes evident before long.  The diamond brilliance of the level design shines through this controlled chaos, which is present in endlessly inventive configurations of genre zones and in the occasional wildcard bit that breaks the rules of all Concursion's fractured worlds.\n\nAnd what of the graphics?  They are a bit coarse perhaps, a bit raw, a bit mismatched, sometimes even a bit MS Paint. In short, Aubrey Beardsley definitely did not serve as chief art director.  But you know what?  The graphics are imperfectly perfect, heta-uma,  prettily pockmarked.  Not only do they suit the merry madness of the level design, but they radiate this bubbly "can do!" exuberance that infected me from the first!  In fact, I almost love the game's awesome attitude (and therefore its art style) as much as its engaging level composition!\n\nWith a fantastic chiptune score and an interesting narrative to sweeten the pot, Concursion is a game that every  indie-lover with twitchy fingers should get.

Mainly, I feel like a lot of the negative reviews here are being a bit unfair and I want to address that.  I will edit the review as I see fit as I continue playing.\n\nFirst of all, Concursion isn't a platformer.  I could understand why Mario and Meat fans would find a bitter sense of disappointment when they pick up this game: "a platformer with world bending mechanics?  How cool!"  A player can easily see within the first few levels that Concursion isn't trying to rack up to the afor mentioned heros of the sidescrolling world.  If being a world-bending platformer was Concursion's goal, I would probably fault it.  But it's not.\n\nConcusion is the combination (quite literally) of several different genres within one game.  The statement on the blurb is pretty accurate: "a multi-genre game played on the boundaries between worlds."  These worlds, of course, come in the form of different genres (or maybe better thought of as ideas) of games.  Taken alone, each idea would be fairly bare-bones.  Yes, the platforming isn't very deep.  The pac-man isn't very deep.  The space shooter isn't very deep.  But looking at each individual segment isn't at all the point here.  Being that this game is meant to be a combination of all of these genres, they have to be taken very holistically.\n\nAs it is, the combination works pretty well.  I've used the interconnection between these worlds in several cool and unique ways to roll my way through each level (which I might point out are so far pretty well paced).  In my head, I've balanced my ability to run in one world with my ability to wall jump in another world with my ability to take more damage in another world all at once, and it feels fairly satisfying as the game is designed for and rewards that sort of thinking.  I feel like I'm playing an action puzzle game, fitting each piece together to create an eventual masterpiece.\n\nThis is where the big flaw with Concusion comes in: putting pieces together to create a puzzle is fun, but it always ends up looking like what the puzzle creator wanted it to look like.  Concursion isn't horribly open-ended.  The largest divergents to simply running through a level at top speed are the collection of the green shards, which don't offer any immediate incentive to get for a player only as far as I outside of just simply collecting them.  Personally, I am a completionist, so I try my best to get all the shards in a level as I go through.  The problem for people that don't much care as much is that a lot of the cool puzzling that I've found so far lie in collecting these shards.  If you just run through without a care, you're going to skip the starch and meat and run into a wall of vegetables, which is probably where a lot of players end up.\n\nOverall, Concursion is going to be either hit or miss.  For me, it was hit.  I like the game, I like the mechanics, I like the interplay, and I feel like the people that made the game are just darned nice people.  It's cute, and a good pick-up when you've been working for hours on end.  7.5/10","January 14, 2015","true","5.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

As soon as I find comfort with one set of mechanics I get challenged by another, and having this all culminate in the absolute bananas of multiple styles in a single level.... wondeful.  Clearly created by someone with a deep seeded love of the genre.  Well done.","January 11, 2015","true","0.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

It combines a lot of classic console/arcade game elements together. I think the critical thing is that it really mixes them in a way that is fun and innovative. The graphics aren't the best, but they do a great job of recreating the art design of console and arcade games. The sound tracks is really, really good.\n\nIt's really fun to try and race this game.

The different genres are there, but I don't like them all, and the transition isn't exactly smooth. I didn't like the auto-scrolling space battles in Rayman and I don't like them here. Borrows heavily from Mario in story and tries to do the HAHA IS PARODY thing which I think is a bad substitute for an actual story. Presentation is fair but I hoped that the main char's sprite could show more than the default expression.  Also, gender option for main char at start would've been nice. Unskippable intro, which is annoying when the game glitched and didn't allow to control my char at the start.","February 10, 2015","false","1.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Very rarely have I raged like this, but when that first boss, who is crazy boring but also somehow still massively hard for the point in the game it exists at, finally let me get beyond the industry standard '3 jumps on the head' and went up to five i was like, honestly, screw this. i wasn't even having fun. i was just annoyed at it. i'm not bad at platformers, i just generally have to sit down a bit and get back into the zone - i love meatboy, i've destroyed almost every mario game, play hundreds of platformers yet for some reason this one just felt 'cheap'. Maybe it's the art/music/design combos and maybe it's just because the difficulty swings wildly from extremely easy to 'what', but while this one has a cool concept, it's just not winning me over.","September 5, 2014","false","0.9"," 12 of 26 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","12","26","0","0"

Lots of clever ideas (changing characters according to background environments on the fly IS cool) but too many trick jumps for me with annoying ennemy placement. It was more a test of my patience than a fun exploration. Sprites didn't gel with the background, giving a definite 'first title' vibe all the time. Maybe focus more on a smaller subset of mechanics before attempting mashups..\n\nI sadly cannot recommend it, but I'd certainly give a shot to a demo of 'Concursion 2' or another title from the devs to see how they get better, because there IS something there.","February 8, 2015","false","1.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"
