If you enjoyed playing micromachines 'way back then' you will instantly feel right at home with Toybox Turbos. The main singleplayer mode is pretty fun and gets you accustomed with the gameplay pretty quickly but it does feel like they could have done a bit more with it.\n\nThe main fun of this game comes from the elimination multiplayer which can be played against the AI, up to 4 friends on the same screen or online. What's better is that you can party up with two or three friends on one screen and play online with other opponents.\n\nMatchmaking works pretty well. Haven't really had any connection issues connecting to other players and the game is mostly lag free. The few times the lag was noticeable, it was relatively miniscule and never really affected the races.\n\nOverall a surprisingly well put together game that captures the feel and the nostalgia of the old Micromachine games.","November 11, 2014","true","4.1"," 41 of 43 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","41","43","0","0"

I finished it in less than four hours, which is something to be aware of.\n\nI also found online to be a little bit buggy and laggy, though this could have been my connection rather than a server side issue.

A genre which hasn't seen too much love in more recent times.\n\nThat is until now!\n\n\nBack to the Future\n\nBack in the present, it's easy to look at Micro Machines with rose tinted glasses.\nIt was a different time back then, games were simpler, mechanics less sophisticated and consumers less demanding.\n\nHow would a game like Micro Machines stand up in todays market?\n\nSimilar titles have been few and far between over the last decade, maybe that's for a reason, or maybe we've all forgotten how much fun this type of game is and it's time to rediscover the genre...\n\n\nSpiritual Successor\n\nIt seems like you can't read a review these days without coming across the phrase "Spiritual Successor".\n\nCiv Beyond Earth was the "Spiritual Successor" to Alpha Centauri, Next Car Game is the "Spiritual Successor" to the Flat Out series, Evil Within is the "Spiritual Successor" to Resident Evil 4, the list goes on and on.\n\nNot being one to buck the trend, I'm going to jump on the reviewers phrase of the moment and call Toybox Turbos the "Spiritual Successor" to Micro Machines.\n\nIt's with this in mind that I approach Toybox Turbos with some trepidation.\n\nI loved Micro Machines, so could this be the reinvention I'm hoping for or a hollow copy that will diminish my fond memories of the franchise.\n\nLet's fire it up and find out!\n\n\nEverything including the Kitchen Sink!\n\nThe first track you'll come across will have your toy car of choice racing around a breakfast table, tearing around dirty plates, avoiding the odd stray baked bean and negotiating the various utensils as you try make it across the water-filled kitchen sink.\n\nYou'll find various little gift boxes floating around the course which, if you manage to pick up, will temporarily modify your vehicle by giving you a speed boost or bolting some sort of weapon to your roof enabling you to try and take out the cars in front (or drop mines to take out the cars behind!)\n\nYou'll also find gold coins littering the track which you'll want to try to collect.\n\n\nToys R Us\n\nAfter each race, the coins you've managed to collect will be added to your total kitty which you can then use purchase new vehicles.\n\nThere are 35 for you to choose from, each fitting into one of seven different categories from construction vehicles to race cars.\n\nAs you browse through the selection you will be treated to a view of each toy packaged in its own toy box which will open once you purchase it.\n\nIt's nice touches like this that really help Toybox Turbos shine.\n\nThere are slight differences in the handling of each vehicle too, a tractor isn't going corner the same as a race car, even if it is a toy.\n\n\nTrack and Field\n\nToybox Turbos fields 18 tracks, all of them bright, colourful and well designed.\n\nYou'll be racing around school desks, kitchen tables, science labs etc. each with their own short cuts to learn and each with their own special touches to make you smile.\n\nYou'll jump over ramps made from cake, be fired into the air by toasters and dodge run-away trains. You can tell that a lot of time and effort has gone into creating these tracks and it really shows.\n\nSure I've got my favourites but all of them are fun to race around, just don't spend too much time admiring the scenery or you'll miss your turn or find yourself trapped behind a stubborn baked bean.\n\n\nThis ruler isn't big enough for the both of us\n\nIt's not just about classic races either, there are end of level bosses, time trials, overtake challenges and escape runs to name but a few.\n\nIf this isn't enough to keep the game fresh for you, then you can take your driving skills online and invite 3 friends to join the fun.\n\nThere's nothing more satisfying than ramming a competitors taxi cab off the edge of a school ruler bridge before accelerating away over a text book and there's not many games you can say that about!\n\n\nEye Spy something beginning with Oculus\n\nAnother plus is the fact that Codemasters have announced that Oculus rift support is planned for this title.\nI'm not sure how this is going to work with this genre but it doesn't stop me being excited about it!\n\n\nToybox (Micro) Troubles\n\nWith regards to criticisms, I'm really going to have to nitpick here.\n\nYou'll unlock all of the content pretty quickly, but after you finish the single player challenges you'll want to take this online anyway so I don't really see that as an issue.\n\nThere's a first to the edge of the screen race mode which can be awkward when your winning because you can't see what's coming next.\n\nThat's really about it, neither of these things are real issues and I only mention them for the sake of balance.\n\n\nToybox Micro Turbo Machines\n\nBack at the begging of this review I was nervous that Toybox Turbos might take something away from my fond memories of Micro Machines and I'm happy to say that this wasn't the case at all.\n\nThis is a title that knows what it wants to be and doesn't fail to deliver.\nIt's an honest, charming and nostalgic experience which captures the feel of the original micro machines titles perfectly.\n\nWhether you were around for the original micro machines or not, I still think you'll find a lot to enjoy here.\n\nIf you're looking for a fast, frantic and above all fun filled little arcade racer then you've found it!\n\nFind the full review and others LINKED HERE[www.review-well.com]\n","November 26, 2014","true","1.9"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","30","32","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/VivaEmptiness/recommended/287260/","VivaEmptiness","=VivaMidnight=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/VivaEmptiness/","1050 products in account","TL;DR Surprisingly solid, enjoyable game. Graphics are spot on, handling is just right, difficulty has challenge without being too hard. Features 4-player local/online multiplayer with plenty of options and tracks. Also top-down retro view for fans of the old Micro Machines games. Would recommend to people who like fun!\n\nI've spent the past year looking for modern-day Micro Machines-alikes but nothing comes close to the originals, I found myself replaying those instead. When I saw that CodeMasters were making a new game (albeit with the license), I was incredibly excited but also very weary. Turns out though, that it's a fantastic little game.\n\nThe difficulty is not overboard like the old ones tended to be but still challenging enough, I often found myself tantilisingly close to a higher place on the online leaderboards too, which added some extra life and replayability to the game.\n\nI realised all too late that you were able to change the camera view to a retro-topdown one but I was surprised actually by how much the new camera view suited the game, I'm usually strictly retro-isometric but I'd happily play this game as-is!\n\nAltogether, this is a well put together title which has clearly had some love lavished upon it, especially considering the low pricepoint. You aren't paying the triple-A money of the original games but you certainly get the quality. The graphics are just right, the handling is great and there are several noticably nice touches in the track design.\n\nI've yet to try out the multiplayer but that is usually where Micro Machines games shone so I have no real worries there.","November 11, 2014","true","21.3"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/urikobb3/recommended/287260/","urikobb3","Neith","http://steamcommunity.com/id/urikobb3/","90 products in account","Toybox Turbos is essentially a rebooted version of the old Micro Machines games in all bar the name. These were fantastic top-down view racing games that used everyday locations to create the race tracks. Toybox Turbos continues that trend and adds vibrant levels with plenty of new obstacles to make things more interesting (or irritating, depending on your preference).\n\nThe game modes are split into Classic (a simple race to the finish line), Escape (outrun a wall of death for as long as you can), Time Trial (complete a number of laps with no competitors as fast as you can), Overtake (as the name suggests, overtake as many AI cars as you can in the time limit) and Elimination which is typically a boss battle. On these the goal is to either destroy your opponent or get far enough ahead that they fall off the screen. Both players start at 5/10 points and you gain a point for getting ahead/lose a point for falling behind. First to 10 wins. These can be a bit irritating if you use the classic top-down view as you often can't see far enough ahead to dodge obstacles in time. Still, it's a minor flaw.\n\nI've not tried the multiplayer yet but the single player is great even on its own. If you're looking for a casual, fun to play racer in the vein of Mario Kart and/or were a fan of the original Micro Machines games then do yourself a favour and pick this up. Great little game. Little...get it? I'll show myself out.","June 13, 2015","true","1.4"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","20","24","3","0"

As others have said, it is the spiritual successor to the old Micro Machines games.   I loved the original NES Mirco Machines so I was excited to try this one.  The game has good graphics, fairly interesting vehicles, and bright and clever course design.  The campaign starts out quite easy but gets challenging, especially for the last two cups.  Unlike the original Micro Machines, there are some power ups scattered around the track.   Luckily, they are not so overpowered as to take over the racing / skill element, ala Mario Kart.   The campaign has a variety of different challenges, so it's not just racing.  There are time trials, picking up clocks, and an interesting mode where you try to pass as many slow cars as possible in 3 laps.  Each level also features a boss level where you must win a series of short, head to head sprints vs. the boss.  The game features bright, cheery graphics and the music and sound effects are appropriate for this style of game.  The game also runs very well on my rather older pc, which is a plus.\n\nThere is also multiplayer.  Depending on the time of day, it can be hit or miss finding a match.  The game also features local multiplayer which might be very fun on big picture etc, but to have more than one player requires Xbox 360 controllers.  Multiplayer races are short sprints run on a single screen, with the slowest cars falling off the screen.  It plays a bit like a party game, not a serious racer in MP.  This game's campaign is pretty short.  I finished it in 4.2 hours, getting 100% achivements, except for local multiplayer.  Achievement hunters beware, you need an Xbox 360 controller to get the local multiplayer achievement, which kind of sucks.\n\nOverall, I liked the game a lot, but I do have some criticisms.  My biggest complaint would be the lack of customization.  Races are always 3 laps, which is quite short.  Courses themselves are really short as well.  You must always choose a "class" of racecars, which is preset.  There is no option to use all of the cars or custom classes which would add variety.   The game is missing a lot of the classic car types from the original.  Powerboats, Road Warriors, helicopters, etc. are all absent.   Overall, most of these issues could be easily fixed with some DLC or the inclusion of Steam Workshop.  It's a solid game with a lot of potential and offers a lot of racing fun.  It's the type of game that you can play for 10 minutes after a long day at work and just relax.  It might even cheer you up!  For 4ish hours of gaming without counting multiplayer, you may want to wait for a sale, however.","January 3, 2015","true","4.3"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

Game settings give you lots of scope for play experience, including the amazing "Retro Top Down" mode which re-creates the effect seen in only the earliest versions of Micro-Machines (i.e. the camera doesn't chase-follow the cars so when you are racing down the screen left and right are reversed).

This sucks because Micro Machines were the best thing. Now they got stupid crap like anime and bad video games and hippies telling people that LEGO is sexist despite the fact that nobody really cares what you buy your stupid kid. Give Johnny a Barbie Doll and give Lacie a Tonka Truck.\n\nOk, but Micro Machines were the best. Even their licensed crap was the best. So it was '90s, back when video games needed effort to make. Someone thought "You know, Micro Machines are cool as hell. Let's go and put them in a video game. And have them race in bedrooms, on tables, at school, in the bath, and out in the garden. And, you know what? It was awesome. Then they did it again and again. Then they made V4 and that was about as disappointing as your average Kickstarter.\n\nBut, now MicroMachines are gone and kids have to grow up playing with Non-Threatening Civil Peace Corps Joe and Empowered Gender Studies Professor Barbie. Someone at Codemasters must've been like "We want another Micro Machines because that game was cool, but there aren't any more Micro Machines. But, because someone there isn't an idiot, they said "Ok who cares about the branding. Just call it Toybox Turbos and make the tracks and such be desks and tables and such, and make the cars toys.\n\nAnd it worked. Toybox Turbos is essentially Micro Machines V5. It's not as good as the original or V3, but it's still great and easily worth $15.\n\nThe controls are tight and responsive, the visuals are colorful and inviting, and it's a lot of fun to play. It's a bit more challenging than the previous games, too.\n\nBut, why do I say it's inferior? Basically, the track variety is all limited to being indoors. And, all wheeled vehicles. Racing helicopters in the garden or powerboats in the pond doesn't happen. Not only that, it's nice to be able to select vehicles instead of being forced into the track flavor like in the original, but it's all limited with in classes. In fact, there's an entire class dedicated to Taxi Cabs. That's kinda lame. Not only that, but the elimination boss characters do love to cheat and stay utterly uneffected by both the stats of their vehicles and track obstacles. This is a pretty lame way of padding out the game time. It serves to only give the player an agonizingly long and unenjoyable boss bout that leaves you longing for just standard racing. In all, the game could've used more classic racing instead of the tacked-on game types.\n\nSure, it's not as cool as the first, but that was a long time ago. This game is still great. If you're as cool as Spider was, then you'll probably check this out.","December 4, 2014","true","1.2"," 25 of 37 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","25","37","2","0"

But to me it seems the developer shows not too much love for this game. First of all, the advertising for this game was nonexistence. This is basically Micro Machines (MM), mostly a solid remake of the PSO MM V3 version. The original MM video game series was Codemasters most successful installment during the glorious generation of 16-bit consoles in the 90s. Nowadays they produce professional racing games like Grid, DiRt and Formula One. It seems like someone at Codemasters feared a loss of reputation by releasing a fun racer like this but still smelled the extra cash that is to be found here. The game itself is technically absolutely first class. I discovered no bugs so far, the game flow is steady and controls are fine. But after inspecting the surface you can almost feel that this child has been abandonded half the way. It has that "get this one done ASAP!" feeling all around. There are some missing features from the original series: no Time Trials, very short tracks, only one multiplayer mode. Online multiplayer feels almost absent. You may play online: but there no one ever around. But after all these negatives one can say this game revives the old spirit very well. The game is charming you right from the start with its colorful and vivid graphic and the easy listening music. The racing tracks feature some funny themes and once the race starts everything gets instantly hysterical. After all this is a easy-to-pickup-game to race several rounds and put it aside after. Do not expect hours of excitement in single player. It is quite uncompetetive. If you can gather some friends locally this rather will provide its real potential. If you are unsure if you want to buy this, play the provided demo. The business department of Codemasters will see this product as cashcow, for the case they require quick cash. So I bet you will see this game in 2-3 months in sale for a nice discount.

There's a nice selection of vehicles ranging from cement mixers to moon buggies and around 7 exquisitely designed environments for you to traverse in about 5 or 6 different game modes. That really is the biggest draw for this game, racing around these wonderfully crafted cartoon environments feels fantastic and it's hard not to be distracted at times trying to take in all the details crammed into each course. The vehicles all handle differently and there's definitely a degree of strategy in selecting the right vehicle for each race but experienced players shouldn't have too much difficulty achieving gold medals in every event. Overall I played for about 5 hours and managed to 100% the game so if single player length is an important factor to you be aware of the relatively short playtime. Big WARNING though, multiplayer is a shell of the single player with just a single game mode available, Elimination, with up to 4 players. This didn't bother me as I mainly bought the game for the single player experience but for those hoping this will provide a compelling online experience, look elsewhere.\n\nI loved my time with Toybox Turbos and for the sale price I paid for it I would absolutely consider it money well spent. I'll probably dive back in every now and then to improve my times but for most part I've had my fill.","June 14, 2015","true","5.0"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

There is nothing inherently bad about the game, but nothing particularly spectacular either. The shallowness of content compared to its predecessors will perhaps turn a lot of nostalgic fans wanting a new and improved MicroMachines game away.\n\nAs a mobile game, the content ticks all the familiar boxes; races are short, are rated with three stars, collecting coins unlocks vehicles, etc. Its biggest problem, as I have previously mentioned, is that it is nothing spectacular and oftentimes feels as if the developers were playing it just a little too safe - In other words, everything Toybox Turbos does as a racing game of its kind has already been seen before with the previous MicroMachines iterations (and in some cases, was done somewhat better).\n\nI would reccomend this game, however, in the hopes that codemasters develops a proper sequel more in the spirit of MicroMachines V3. What is old is new again. The negative review simply reflects a personal (subjective) disappointment.","December 22, 2014","false","1.1"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

The game provides 35 cars and 18 tracks and there are various game modes but they are for single player only. For some reason multiplayer has Elimination mode for both local and online multiplayer.\n\nThe game has 7 tiers of cars, the first tiers are a bunch of taxi, london cab and buses while the second tier are a set of off road vehicle which provide SUV, moon buggy and even a monster truck. The cars gets faster every tier, the final tier of cars are race cars which provides a classic F1 car, dragster, sportscar (which looks exactly like a low poly GRID 1 and GRID Autosport drift Mazda RX7) and a hot hatchback.\n\nThe cars feels very floaty and all of them drive similarly, they are a bunch of Micro Machine scale toy.\n\nIn the single player mode, there a total of 7 cup and each cup has 5 race. Each cup are restricted to specific tiers of vehicle and specific set of races. There are 6 type of game modes here, Classic Racing, Overtake (like the ones in GRID 2), Escape, Elimination, Time Trial and Countdown.\n\nClassic Racing also includes weapons, weapons can be used to overcome your opponent. There are a few weapons in the game such as hammers, EMP, rifle, turbo boost, mine and magnets. Magnets could pull you closer to your opponent cars, hammers lets you wreck your opponent cars and EMP could slow down the cars around you.\n\nOvertake mode requires the player to overtake a bunch of cars around the track which acts like traffic. The player wins by overtaking an amount of cars set by the game.\n\nEscape mode has a wave of water or force field like thing chasing behind you, the player requires to drive the furthest distance possible before your car being covered the water or force field.\n\nElimination mode is also the boss race in the single player mode, weapons are provided in this game mode as well. This mode plays a bit like NFS Underground 2 outrun mode, the player requires to drive as fast as possible until your opponent car is not seen on the screen and the player loses when the car is not seen in the screen, got destroyed by weapons or flew off the track. A score is given when the player wins and 1 score taken away when you lose, the player win this race by filling up the score bar. If the race takes too long to end with constant plus and minus 1 score from you and the opponent, the game will starts putting mines around the track and losing will no longer deduct a score but every win still adds 1 score.\n\nTime Trial mode ask the player to clock the fastest time on the track but the tracks has mines to disrupt your racing line.\n\nCountdown mode is similar to Time Trial mode, the tracks has mines placed around it as well. The difference is the player requires to pick up "clocks" to add time to their timer, the player lose when the timer ran out of time and wins by reaching the finish line with most time left.\n\nThe single player AI starts off to be very easy and they dont seem to use the weapons they pick up at all but it gets better and faster as you progress through the cups.\n\nOne of the problem for the single player is the lack of proper quick race mode, you cant pick a set of cars and track combination you wanted to do a race or any other mode. The special game modes are restricted to the "Single Player" section which act as the career but the local multiplayer can be used as a "quick race" mode. You could start a local lobby yourself and the game will fill the opponent with AI, you could chose the tier of cars you and tracks you wanted to race but the multiplayer is resticted to Elimination mode only. The hard AI in the game is pretty challenging and could provide a couple more hours of fun.\n\nThe game provides both online and local multiplayer up to 4 players, the only game mode for multiplayer is Elimination mode. It plays the same way like in the single player mode but instead of having 1v1 you are having a 4 player elimination race.\n\nI'll highly recommend this game if it goes on sale for around $10, the game length is really short. It took me 4 hours to finish the game with all stars and all achievement (the achievement are super easy though). For the full price Codemasters is asking for now, it is still pretty good if you are a fan of top down racer, likes the toy cars feel with bright colours and casual racing.","November 16, 2014","true","6.8"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Countdown in which you start off with little time and have to collect clocks to get more time BUT you must cross the finish line on your last lap with a certain amount of time to get Gold. And then there's Overtake which is the most stupid mode; you have to overtake a certain number of AI vehicles within the lap limit.\n\nBoss battles are the only time in the single player game that the classic 'Elimination' mode is utilised in which you either destroy your opponent or gain enough lead on them that they are off the screen.\n\nPhysics are a little too floaty at times and you'll be frustrated by the amount of time it takes to right your vehicle if you're knocked over and there's no button to quickly reset your car.\n\nTrack design is a little too simplistic, they're all too short and all of them taking place indoors. Beating the single player mode enables mirror mode in multiplayer but it would have been nice to vary things in single player with mirrored tracks.\n\nVehicle types are really limited (there are no water based vehicles) and the weapons are fairly boring and useless.\n\nYou do get a feeling that Codemasters made this game with tons of DLC in mind which, if is the case, I think they have perhaps shot themselves in the foot for not offering a more stripped down version of the base game as a free starter pack. But the asking price isn't actually that bad and there is fun to be had.\n\nI think multiplayer is where this game will really shine but I don't except the flame to burn that long and wouldn't be surprised to see this game heavily discounted in the coming months.\n\nFinal verdict? A fun but very short lived spiritual successor to Micro Machines with too little of the actual spirit.","November 16, 2014","true","4.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Also the one that tought that filling the track with jumps that send you flying into curves was a good idea should be fired.\nThe cars are nice, but they don't really play much different from each other.

While other games will try to make you feel in charge, Toybox Turbos makes it very clear that the developers are running the show.\n\nOther games try to give you an explanation why that camera is at that ungodly angle, or why THAT enemy has to have three times as much health. Not TT. The reason why the camera won't let you look ahead, is because the developers wanted to make it slightly frustrating. Ditto on the strange car physics... and let's not even speak about how the camera is always NOT right behind the car, leaving you slightly disoriented.\n\nAccept that this as the real challenge you've been given and TT will be a lot of fun. Or at least as much fun as you can have with 18 tracks. Yes, the game is very short. Four hours and you should have received every car, track and achievement that's available.\n\nWhat makes Toybox Turbos different from the hundreds of mobile games that try to imitate Micro Machines is that it does not ever apologize for its shortcomings. With a camera that limits how far you can see, you'd expect long straight streets with virtually no obstacles. You'd expect environments that never block your view. You'd maybe expect a mini-map. And you'd definitely expect the camera to tightly follow your car at predictable angles.\n\nTT will have none of that. Instead you're given confusing environments with sharp turns, narrow straights, hundreds of deathtraps, a lot of stuff that is only designed to get in your way or block your view and a camera that will make every tight turn an exercise in multitasking.\n\nAnd it works. It's a kind of challenge I haven't seen in years and it is oh so refreshing to encounter it once again. True, in the day of Micro Machines, the technology of the day required this kind of limitation, while it's just an artistic choice now, but it still feels good. And in a way, you feel like every match is a personal match against the designers.\n","November 16, 2014","true","4.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Unlocking a car feels like buying a toy car!\n\n+Fast gameplay It may be a boring game if you're losing the race, but fast gameplay covers it so that you can start the next round quickly.\n\n+A bunch of gamemodes that would save you from getting bored\n\n+Not-bad single play level design\n\n\n\n-CONs\n-No map editor It could be a limitless content when you can use your childhood-days stuff to make a race map. I feel really sorry for not having the map editor.\n\n-Sight control Player's sight is very important matter when it comes to fast-paced game. In this game, you have to push ESC and go to setting menu to adjust your sight.

But I was a massive fan of the first 2D MicroMachines growing up and that game's DNA can be found here despite being quite different on the surface. This game just "feels" right and is plain FUN! There's a wide variety of cars that do feel quite different, but there's a nearly screen length massive drafting system. So you can catch most cars with most cars and keep races close. Then while they went big on the amount of cars they dropped the ball on track amount. Most of the track themes are there though and provide a wide variety of fun scenery. I do really wish they would've included outdoor and garage tracks. And then there's enough modes to keep you interested throughout the campaign (Race, Overtake, Time Trial, Survive, and some other time related one). It was simple fun that brought back some good feelings.\n\nI did manage to 100% the singleplayer aspects within 2.5hrs which doesn't thrill me. The original MicroMachines was pretty much unbeatable as the difficulty increased. This rarely posed much of a challenge. Which is where we come into the price discussion. $14.99USD is too much. I would feel pretty bummed out at the singleplayer lack of a challenge if I forked over that much. But that's what sales and bundles are for! This was a superb bundle toss in game for me and became a hidden gem because of the bargain.\n\nSimply put; I had fun. Lots of fun. But not full price fun. Shop wisely!\n\nEdit 1: Played some local multiplayer. Good fun. Only one game mode which is "elimination". And car choices are limited to one of the classes at a time. These consist of 4 or 5 car choices. So it ends up another shallow experience. Fun! But shallow.\n\nEdit 2: Finding some good times on online multiplayer while its populated from the recent Humble Bundle crowd. Still just one game mode, and there can be host lag. But eh, its another couple hours of fun. Receommended for sure. :)","December 2, 2015","true","8.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

No cheating AI?\n2. No imba powerups/cars?\n3. No frustrating gamemodes?\n\nThis is it.\n\nInstead of cheating AI, there's slipstreaming, just like GTA Online (driving in the trail of your opponent makes you go faster). Unlike GTA Online, once everyone is bunched up together, the race gets more fun, not less, so it's not an issue here but rather a very big plus. The powerups are all balanced and the receiver even has a chance to negate some of them (i.e. being set on fire actually speeds you up, so you can use it to gain a massive lead, however you also get very slippery controls and if you touch an obstacle, you die, so only do if you're not on fire). This is a game of skill, not luck, so no matter what powerup you get, you're not any worse off than the other guy.\n\nThe cars are divided into groups depending on their speed, so you can't under any circumstance race against a superior car. At the same time, various cars in a group are all different in their handling and you're guaranteed to find your favorites. They went complete nuts with their designs so racing bulldozers, tanks or moon buggies is a normal occurence (they're all reasonably fast despite not looking the part).\n\nI've only played through the campaign alone, and I had a blast, in fact I find myself playing Elimination just for fun even now. I can only imagine how fun multiplayer would be, but alas, I've yet to catch an online game that doesn't lag so much it's unplayable, and my dear roommate thinks inviting him to play is an assault on his loyalty to Need for Speed. But I assure you this is the game you want to play with friends, there is absolutely nothing standing between you and the fun.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/carnagehurts/recommended/287260/","carnagehurts","cilla black","http://steamcommunity.com/id/carnagehurts/","381 products in account","TL;DR AT BOTTOM OF THIS REVIEW\n\nToybox Turbos is the spiritual successor to the Micro Machines series, which is also developed by none other than Codemasters. It is reminiscent of the classic arcade top-down racing games which were popular way back when, and it really feels nostalgic just playing the game.\n\nGraphically, the game is excellent for what it is, and the gameplay is excellent also. It certainly reminds me personally of the Micro Machines games of old. The level design is decent as well; levels reminiscent of Micro Machines games. Players of the past games will certainly recognise the similarities, such as the pool table level and the kitchen table level in particular. The different 'game modes' kept me on my toes and kept me hooked to the game, my personal favourite was the 'Countdown' mode, which I felt offered the biggest challenge. The single player mode is split up into various 'heats' in which the player takes control of a certain class of vehicle in a specific heat. Vehicle classes such as 'service vehicles' include vehicles such as an ice-cream van or a milk float, whearas 'construction vehicles' includes diggers and bulldozers for example. There is a small degree of customisation in the form of paint jobs to each vehicle, but customisation isn't a big concern when you begin to buy and unlock newer, better vehicles and progress through the different vehicle classes.  Multiplayer works fine, although I can see local multiplayer being more enjoyable, as it is the ideal party game. Mario Kart-esque power-up crates can also be used, ranging from offensive weapons such as machine guns, mines and hammers, to power-ups designed to give you an advantage, like the jet engine. I am also aware that this game has Oculus Rift DK2 implementation, which can only be a good thing.\n\nDespite the gameplay being exciting, enjoyable and relatively varied, this game does come with some issues.\n1. The in-game volume is not adjustable, there are only the options to turn music or sound on or off. This poses a problem especially if you're talking to friends on Steam chat/Skype/Teamspeak, or listening to music for example.\n2. The difficulty in gameplay seems to take a massive leap from remarkably easy to pretty hard in places. The first few heats are extremely easy and you will blow through them in 5 minutes, while the last few can take a few tries in order to get a perfect score.\n3. The game is far too short. As you can see from my gametime I have completely finished this game in little over 1 hour, and I have attained every single achievement in the process.\n4. The price. Even though I got this game in the holiday sale for ¬£5.99/‚Ç¨8/$10 for 50% off, I still feel this game does not even warrant a half price discount, let alone a full asking price. I can appreciate the fact that this is a new release but somehow, for the length and depth of the game, it simply does not live up to its ¬£11.99 price tag unfortunately.\n\nTL;DR\nIf you are a fan of the Micro Machines game series, like old arcade racing games and cartoony graphics, then definitely pick up this game. I would advise against buying this game for the full asking price however, as it is extremely short and anyone intelligent enough will find the game remarkably easy to finish fully. Alternatively, if you are looking for a fun, action-packed party game, then this game wouldn't be a bad buy whatsoever. Kids will dig it as well.","December 21, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Revvie/recommended/287260/","Revvie","Rev","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Revvie/","98 products in account","Your childhood, now in 3D!\nThe fact that codemasters still care about this classic series brought a tear to my eye.\n\nSeriously though, this game is pretty great. If you're a big fan of the old 2D MM games as I am, you'd probably enjoy the ride.\n\nFirst of all, the graphics. You've probably seen the screenshots, and to be honest, it doesn't seem to look all that impressive. It's certainly far behind in quality to codemaster's other racing games, say, GRID or DiRT. That's certainly what I thought. But make no mistake -- once you play the game, you will see that the graphics aren't bad at all. The game was designed to be lightweight and welcoming, and that's exactly what the graphics on this game does: it makes you feel good. It's the kind of game you'd want to play waking up on a saturday morning. The upbeat music also helps. One of the reason I wasn't too fond of MM V4 was because of the danky graphics and techno-electronic music tracks. This game has none of that.\n\nThen there's the gameplay. While racing through an environment of tabletop items is pretty fun in itself, the game adds a few elements to make it more interesting, such as items and different race modes. I don't have much else to say on this aspect, other than that it's very faithful to the MM games of old (it even has a retro camera!) which is never a bad thing.\n\nOf course, the game isn't without its caveats. The single player campaign is very short, it has too few tracks (18), and the difficulty curve can be pretty overwhelming. The one thing I was most dissapointed about though, was the lack of variety. The old MM games had many different types of tracks, including gardens, sandboxes, and even bathtubs (personal favorite), each with its own set of challenges. Even the traditional tabletop levels were much more creative (music boxes and whatnot). This game does away with that, and rather just offers you a few different tracks of 3 themes -- breakfast, school science lab, billiards, and construction playground. While there's nothing wrong with the tracks themselves, they can get pretty old pretty quick. This game would have benefited greatly if codemasters had included workshop support, but I guess that's asking a bit much from a niche game such as this.\n\nAnother thing I find annoying about the game -- though this is purely subjective -- is the use of a mobile-game like scoring system. You got 1st place? 3 stars. 2nd place? 2 stars etc. Then you use said stars to unlock more levels. While there's nothing technically wrong with this system, I'd prefer that my PC games stay away from mobile game mechanics.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're a die hard MM fan, then consider buying this game. If you're just a casual racer looking for some quick fun, you'd better wait until it goes on sale. For the latter, it's not really worth the asking price.","January 7","true","2.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A tiny car. You race other tiny cars around tiny tracks made of household objects like dishes in the kitchen sink and books with witty titles. You collect tiny parcels that give you silly powerups such as an EMP device and, of course, the timeless mounted instakill mallet.\n\nAnd it's a racing game, so the objective is to get to the finish line first after 3 laps, right? Well, no. Not necessarily. The single-player campaign has various game modes: There's the (relatively) dull go-round-3-times-win-congrats mode, the rather tense OMG-flee-from-scary-blue-space-stuff mode, the satisfying make-traffic-explode-by-overtaking mode, and others.\n\nAnd then there's THE mode. The way it's meant to be played: The mode where the objective is to get your opponent off the screen by any devious means necessary - by strategically nudging them off the bridge of rulers, by tactically falling back before opening fire with a tiny tommy gun, or just by being boring and going fast.\n\nAnd on top of the solid mechanics, there are loads of lovely little details:\n\nPlenty of maps with creative designs and hidden shortcuts.\nThe little joy of unlocking the collectable cars by taking them out of their packages.\nLocal and online multiplayer.\nThe 'classic' camera mode.\nA host of vehicles - hovercraft, bulldozers, black cabs, tanks - each with customisable colour schemes and their own horn effect. (Yes, they even added a 'honk horn' button. What does it do? Nothing, if you don't count putting a grin on your face.)\nA demo so you don't even need to read this review. I don't know why you'd still be reading. Just go and play a couple of rounds for free.\nI don't generally enjoy racing games. I'm not a nostalgic person.

Dicksmack","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thatfemaledog/","654 products in account","Toybox Turbos is a very easy game. Now, easy doesn't necessarily mean bad but I just can't see myself recommending this game to anyone except die hard fans of the Micro Machines V games. And even then... I was a huge fan of V3 when I was a kid. And this game does make you relive the nostalgia you had during those times but the game fails to really expand on anything or make itself stand out.\n\nThe biggest disappointment by far is the tracks. Not only is there not many of them, but they're insanely short. A single track could take just 20 seconds to complete each lap for a grand total of minute long races. I can't recall if Micro Machines had longer tracks but, in this game, the tracks are just way too short. The visuals are nice but you'll get tired of seeing the same scenery over and over again especially when the design of them aren't exciting or challenging. Every track feels roughly the same and doesn't keep the races fresh. Shortcuts are rather weak and don't have any sort of creativity put behind them except for maybe one or two. Most of them just involve creating a small micro shortcut that let's you skip a hairpin turn.\n\nThere's not much to really complain about the driving other than the really dumbed down physics. Colliding with other drivers doesn't cause much penalty to you or them so trying to play dirty doesn't work. That's left up to the weapons and they're honestly really boring when you stip them down to their basic principle. There's a hammer which destroys anything in front of you in one hit, a machine gun with autoaim that can kill you and mess up your handling, an emp ball that is supposed to short out the controls but is so minimal it's useless, a magnet that let's you instantly snap to any other driver, and rocket boosters. That's really it.\n\nThe game's music is okay I guess. It's nothing too exciting there's really only about 3-5 music tracks to go around so get used to that. The music varies depending on the mode you're playing and... well there's only 5. You have your standard races (which only go to a max of 4 for some reason), time trials, race against the clock, overtaking and escape. Escape is by far the best mode but eventually you get to a point where the blue aura of death goes much faster than you and kills you automatically making fighting for the leaderboard rather impossible.\n\nApart from that the game is just too easy. It has a spike in difficulty once you reach the 4th or 5th cup but for the first few cups you'll be whizzing right through every challenge with ease. Despite the spike in difficulty I still managed to beat the game and unlock every car within 3 hours.\n\nThe multiplayer is decent enough. I've yet to play classic mode but they made the smart choice of taking the Elimination mode from the boss-battles and made it between 4 players which is nice. Players fight for points as one person either A. Has to leave the pack behind in the dust or B. Be the last one still alive. But it's hard to recommend because no one seems to own this game and the only one online battle I was able to find was on launch day.\n\nOverall Toybox Turbos does a fair job of being reminiscent of the old Micro Machines games but fails to capture the same charm and fun those games had. It just doesn't do anything new or exciting to make itself stand apart. Again, if you're a true Micro Machines V fan then I suggest checking out the demo, but even then I'd be wary of making a purchase.\n\nToybox Turbos gets a 6/10.","November 17, 2014","false","3.6"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","4"

About halfway through the game you stop seeing new tracks and are just playing through the same variety of modes across the same tracks, just you go a little faster. It took me about an hour and twenty minutes to get 3-stars on all of the tracks, beat all of the bosses and grind up the rest of the coins to buy the remaining 2 cars at the end of the game.\n\nFor someone who hasn't played a racing game before, it might be quite challenging. I'm sure the game is targeted towards children who don't even know what a Micro Machine is.\n\nBut for me, who does know what a Micro Machine is, I felt it was missing quite a lot. There were no wacky cast of characters to choose from as your racer, the AI all did the same thing every race, including driving up against walls and flying off the track in Head to Head mode and there's only one track in the entire game where you get to drive in the pockets of the pool table and you only get to race on it once.\nFor a remake of the classic Micro Machines games it presents to you the absolute minimum. Small cars driving on familiarly themed but equally tiny tracks.\n\nFor $10, it's a fun little nostalgia trip with a few funny references tossed into the event names, a charming aesthetic and some great miniature cars you can paint up how you like. But the overall game itself is very lacking and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except children and fans of the older games.","November 28, 2014","false","4.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The matchmaking screen is totally useless.\n\n3) For the past few months, there have been many players seeking help for technical issues related to the game. However, the developer has never answered any of these questions on the Steam forum. Why is that? It's because the developer has been busy with a new project called Dirt Rally, which I'm sure has become their new cash cow.  Therefore, they basically regard this junk as ABANDONWARE. It's pretty naive to expect this irresponsible developer to do anything to improve this game. Code Masters? More like Code Scumbags.\n\nStay away from this crap if you want some multiplayer fun.

Its execution is almost flawless for what it is - a fun, cheerful racer without a serious bone in its body. The music is excellent, the visuals are very good, the difficulty design (curve) is good... a bit frustrating at times but I suppose most people expect challenge from games (I don't - I just want the achievements).\n\nSo let's say that's a 9/10. But then... On top of all that comes my 1994 Micro Machines nostalgia - that is a force to be reckoned with. I still remember days spent playing the shareware demo in awe. And this is surely a worthy successor. Heck, it's made by the same company!\n\nSo the end result is in the ballpark of "19/10,  bretty good - IGN"","March 27","true","6.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It is Micro Machines in all but name, but still manages to capture the look and feel of those classics.\n\nRacing takes place on courses in various rooms of the house just as an imaginative young mind might create. Most of the courses are fun and feature lots of big jumps and tight corners and are set in some imaginative locations such as a dinosaur park, a kids party and dad's snooker table. Most of them have hazards such as train tracks to jump over, oil slicks to slip on and even a volcano spitting out lava onto the track. There are also a great selection of vehicles which include the usual sports cars and hatchbacks as well as diggers, earth movers, police cars and tanks.\n\nAs you race around you can collect power ups which you can then use to blast the living daylights out of any other racers who happen to stand between you and an ill deserved first place. Remember that they can give as good as they get and will shoot back. Races are quite short at only 3 laps and over within a flash.\n\nIn the single player game each championship is based around a certain type of vehicle such as emergency or construction vehicles. These include the normal finish first races, time trials and overtake challenges. Each one ends with a one on one boss race where you have to outrun or blast your opponent to win. Do this a set number of times and you win their car and unlock the next championship. The game also features a good multi player mode with all of these types of races and more.\n\nUnfortunately the game is quite short ‚Äì you will finish the single player game in a couple of hours and even the multi player doesn't really give you that much more to do. It has a sort of "seen it done it" feel to it which becomes a little monotonous after a while. Having said that the game is fun while it lasts.\n\nIt does have a fairly low price tag and Micro Machines fans will probably get more out of it, but the short play time hurts it a lot ‚Äì if you really want it get it on sale...","December 28, 2014","false","6.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

Toybox Turbos is great! - but WHY did codemasters make such an awful multiplayer?\n\nCodemasters has made some amazing race titles over the years (see the DIRT & GRID series of games), and brought their great engine and art design to a new frontier in the micro-machines inspired Toybox Turbos.  The preview video looks amazing, the gameplay is cartoony fun, and I can even forgive the kid-friendly difficulty level, but there are some glaring problems here. There are little things like 4:3 overlays that look strange on 16:9 monitors and a bizzare playoff mode - but the most horrible thing is the state of the multiplayer and overall jankyness of the online modes. The only option for competition is this game mode where you race for 8-10 seconds and respawn over and over. It is so mind-numbing it makes me sad. The inclusion of a normal race mode would have made all the difference in the world. WTF Codemasters!\n\nI actually purchased the 4-pack since I was so excited to play with my friends, but at this point I want my money back. 6 / 10 for a game that I want to like so much.

Mostly small race tracks coupled with extremely childish designs for the most part and really not capturing the scale of how small these cars are really meant to be.\n\nI remember playing many of the older Micro Machines racing games and racing around backyards, toilet bowls, workshops, classrooms, bedrooms and many more awesome locations that took use of a basic home, work or school life and turned these locations into arenas of extreme racing.\n\nThis game unfortunately failed to capture many environments and didn't scale them very well as you could probably tell with a sub 500MB download.\n\nMost of the tracks in this game were extremely exaggerated covering the sides of the maps with far too many objects that lacked enough detail to feel like they're real world items.\n\nThe vehicles were okay but there weren't very many compared to the old games. Yes, I understand this has taken a new name and I'm glad this is so because this does NOT live up to Micro Machines.\n\nI would have liked to have seen a less cartoony look, a bigger variations of track styles and less locations that felt like a toddlers play room.\n\nThis game is fun to play but is severely let down by the lack of REAL variety in tracks, short race tracks, blundering physics and a poor misuse of three dimensions.\n\nMultiplayer works fine but does get boring relatively quickly.\n\nI'd give this game perhaps a 5/10 because it's not a horrible game by any means but having a long living legacy as one of the best racing games of my child hood miserably failed to stand up to previous titles and has been put to shame by it's predecessor "Micro Machines 2: Turbo Tournament" which was release way back in 1991 when I was only 7 or 8 years old. This game had far more responsive controls, more memorable graphics and locations and much better audio aswell.\n\nThis new game feels like it would run well on a mobile phone and that's really disappointing. Why go the 3D route and put almost zero effort into the assets.?\n\nToo long didn't read: Doesn't live up to predecessors in any way at all apart from having online play. Poor effort in creating good physics and graphics. This game has low replayability. Bored after 1-2 hours. Shame really as I love MicroMachines.\n\nWhere are the boats???? Where are all the vehicles?? OMG Whyyyyyyyyyyyyy?? Why is this the latest MicroMachines *Cries*\n\nThis game isn't a bad game, but even when not compared to MM it still leaves a lot to be desired.\n\n5/10","November 4, 2015","false","0.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","2"

I do not like the camera angle. Its annoying and it stupidly pans out so that both cars are showing on the screen. So the player car cannot see whats in front of him. Also the views are not very good as well. Instead of the 3d side view I would have liked  a view right behind the car. I just think they could have done better with the camera and offered more viewpoints. You have 3 or 4 views and 1 of them is useless. The top down view is useless as you cannot see the track to navigate. Also the cars do get quicker  and rather then help the game I feel like it hurts the game even more because of the terrible viewpoints the game sticks you with. A better game would be Little Racers STREET that has more cars and a much more interesting tracks and even includes weather effects. It also has a ton of camera angles including a bumper camera behind the car.\n\nAlso the tracks are super small. So when your racing your car around the track races are over very quickly and this gives me the impression of an android game.  I did try the demo and enjoyed it because it was easy to win races. Later in the game it gets much tougher and its a lot more annoying. So more speed plus a crummy camera angle=a turn off for me.","October 10, 2015","false","0.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It would be great if Codemasters fixed the wonky controls and created a DLC that added longer and harder tracks.","December 2, 2014","false","2.9"," 0 of 4 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","4","0","0"

Only sad thing is that a tiny skip or bump will slow you down enough to make you lose. I seem to recall Micro-Machines being slightly more forgiving. It could do with a few more modes or tracks, but apart from that, it's a good game.\n\nThe ONLY reason I'm saying it's not recommended at the moment, is that there are a number of us users that simply can't load the game up on the machine they want to. For example, I have a Win 8.1 i7 hooked up to a 46inch HDTV. I had some friends over, and wanted to give this a go. When we tried to load it, the game would crash back to desktop, refusing to load at all.\n\nThe devs have released a small patch, but they're yet to fix the crash for me and others... I just hope they don't give up, as I'd like to play it on a big screen, rather than just a tiny laptop.\n\nI don't mean to suggest the game is bad, but I recommend people try the demo first, just in case they can't play it either.","November 16, 2014","false","2.9"," 4 of 15 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","4","15","0","0"

So let get it straight: singleplayer mode is great. Not "Game of the Year" great, but pretty decent. It is very nostalgic if you played Micromachines on Sega Genesis / Playstation / PC, but on the other hand it somehow lacks variety in types of 'landspaces' and cars (no roof  / basement / outdoor tracks, no water tracks and no water types of vehicles - except for one, no toilet and bathroom tracks). But these are very minor gripes. The biggest flaw is multiplayer. Lack of variety in multiplayer (only one game mode!) considerably kills replayability and online activity, which is sad, because single player features many interesting modes. Also the price is not quite justified. For the price lower on 30% you may get Blaze Rush - a pretty good arcade racing game (inspired by another great old school racing game - Rock n' Roll Racing , with very good multiplayer mode and ability to connect straight away to somebodies' game). As reported the singleplayer campaign consist only about 4 hours of gameplay on 18 tracks, which will repeat two or more times during the campaign, which is quite short and may be an issue for some players.\nI cannot recommend buying the game right now, it is better to wait for a sale (30% or more). But you can try demo, and buy the game mostly for singleplayer.\nHope the developers add more multiplayer modes; otherwise this game may vanish in other Steam games very fast.","November 13, 2014","false","1.6"," 9 of 32 people (28%) found this review helpful","28","9","32","0","0"

If you loved the old MM games you won‚Äôt be completely disappointed. You still drive small cars around in different household environments. The feel is still there. The graphics are excellent. The game IS fun, but unfortunately it has a lot of flaws dragging it down‚Ä¶\n\nThat being said, here is my list of complaints:\n\nWorst of all, the game is physics based. That doesn‚Äôt mean realistic cars, but rather random cars. You bounce around randomly. Sometimes a mine will turn you upside down and you must turtle your way around; and sometimes you‚Äôll be blown way forward, landing perfectly on all four wheels. Sometimes you‚Äôll hit a small bump and your car will turn 180 degrees. Good luck making a three point turn to get back on tracks. And should you have the misfortune to drive into an object you‚Äôll find that you can‚Äôt just steer to one of the sides to get free. Nope, you have to slowly back away then steer away.\n\nEnjoy almost driving over the edge, think you are gonna make it and then slowly slide over the edge after all. Real nice waste of time in a racing game.\n\nThe power-ups just add to the randomness, but don‚Äôt add much fun. Some are useless like the EMP while other are overpowered like the instant kill hammer. Your luck in getting power-ups often dictates who wins and looses.\n\nThe singleplayer experience is short. You‚Äôll have completed everything with all achievements in a couple of hours.\n\n‚Ä¶Which is lucky, because this is one of those games that locks away content, forcing you to chore through singleplayer, even if you just want to play with friends.\n\nAnd speaking of playing with friends. I hope you like the ‚Äúelimination‚Äù gamemode, because that‚Äôs the only gamemode in multiplayer. You literally have no options other than selecting stage, cars and weapons on/off.\n\nThere are NO fun cars. Remember the planes, boats, helicopters and tanks from the old Micromachines (1+2) games? No? Neither does Codemasters. Well, we got a tank but it doesn‚Äôt shoot, so it‚Äôs basically just a car. There are a decent number of different cars but they all mostly feel the same.\n\nAll stages have basically the same layout. Just a bland mix of twists and turns. None of them stand out in any way.\n\nNo level editor.\n\nDefinitely a lack of tunes. You feel like you hear the same two songs over and over!\n\nSome stages have hazards. Problem is some hazards which change. A volcano spits fireballs in random locations. Some cue balls roll back and forth. This again just adds to the randomness. Are you lucky to slip past or do you crash?\nToybox Turbos is fun because you race small cars on funny sceneries against friends. But any racing game like this is equally fun. Once the novelty of not-Micromachines wears off you are left with a pretty poor and unpolished game.\nI can recommend dusting off the old SEGA or Amiga and play Micro Machines Turbo Tournament '96, instead.\n\n4/10","January 29, 2015","false","7.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LWGRPGAMER/recommended/287260/","LWGRPGAMER","Iroha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LWGRPGAMER/","92 products in account","Aaah, Toybox Turbos, a game in 2014 made by other than Codemasters, the ones who started a legend - Micro Machines. They do longer own the title name which is a big shame but, this didn't stop them from making this spiritual sucessor of Micro Machines...V4...I think. Either way, onto teh poit. Die-hard fans or any one getting into the racing genre, should get his? Absolutely, especially with a 75% off discount on it! It's hardly updated these days but doesn't mean the game is mega dead. People, somehow still play it and I got the achievement I needed to make sure I 100% clear this game.\n\nYou are given one car only, you can unlock the rest by yourself by grabbing these shiny coins around the tracks, and trust me, you'll eb grabbing a lot, once I tell you this. People said this game is easy, it's not as easy as you think. Ofcourse, the first world is mega easy, each world contains a set of different events, not just races but challenges, and these has leaderboards, which is fun. After all event are clear or at a certain given amount of stars is reach, the boss can now be dueled. Win against him, and the vehicle's yours. Basically, a pink slip.\n\nAfter World 2, things start getting harder, and harder like, it makes you avoid the coins you need to buy the cars you want. So that's already something good aboutt he game - it might be short, but it's all pretty challenging if you're not excellent in racing games - I do okay and I still manage to fail here and there sometimes.\n\nNow for multiplayer - sad part of it, has one mode only, which is just like The MM games = stay offscreen behind, your out and you lose points, depending of your position. Be the only one in teh screen and you'll get teh maximum points of the round, and along with weapons and madness, while can be repetitive after a while, it's a blast. I haven't tried locally because I don't have that many friends with me at this moment but online proved actually fun.\n\nIf you have some real life friends to play with, get this and gift them this too, unless they have it too. It's major fun for the whole family. The graphics and visuals are cartoony and gets that Micro Machines appeal.\n\nI'll give it a solid 8 out of 10, get it on full price if you want Codies to deserve the money or get it discounted for 75%off, this game is at the very bargainy price, perhaps right too.","October 25, 2015","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Basically a crazy racing game with a variety of customizable miniature (toybox) cars and suped-up weapons (e.g. giant hammers on the roof of your vehicle!), TT features a range of tracks such as the pool table, science lab, kitchen etc. All of the features that made the original Micro Machines games so good are here, plus some new game modes such as 'overtake' and 'escape' in single player, and (of course) online play. The multiplayer facilities in TT are quick and simple, meaning you can jump into races easily and race as few or as many tracks as you like. Plus, you can still play on the same computer with a friend, using controller(s)/WASD/arrow keys. Overall, a very fun game that is really great value on steam sale.","October 30, 2015","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not the worst, but it definitely made the ranking.  The 3 options for the camera are awful, and it's more about learning the course and the shortcuts than anything else.  If the camera would just zoom out JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE, it would be worlds better.  But the camera isn't why I rage quit this awful game.\n\nComplaint #1.  After failing multiple times on a particular race, I won it by parking and waiting for initial item respawn after the cheating AI races ahead of you at the start (using slower vehicles, or the same vehicle you're using) and grabs all the items.  With smashy hammer in tow, I easily caught up and ended my fail streak.\n\nComplaint #2. I intentionally slow down my laps during escape races.  I'm pretty sure the wave's speed is tied to your average speed, because once I started doing slow/medium/fast laps I started 3 starring those.\n\nComplaint #3.  Many races were won by gunning into first from last place during the last lap to avoid being auto-targeted by the PC's who seem to love shooting at you but not each other.\n\nEnd synopsis: this game is utter ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t.

Sadly, the game doesn't have many of the more "out there" elements of other Micro Machine games: dropping on the floor and jumping back on a table, garden/beach/museum levels or boat races.\n\nAll cars look really nice and are very well modeled. You can even see the screw under your car when you turn over. Locked cars are in their "retail boxes" and you unbox them when purchasing them with game coins. That's just brilliant. You can also recolor them, which is a nice touch.\n\nThe game is fairly short and not too hard, but considering this is a game about toy cars, I'd say those are a plus.

It was even made by Codemasters.\n\nThe game's beauty is undeniable. Look at those cool, colorful tracks filled with everyday items! Although the tracks are short, they are filled with interesting details. Sadly, the game doesn't have many of the more "out there" elements of other Micro Machine games: dropping on the floor and jumping back on a table, garden/beach/museum levels or boat races.\n\nAll cars look really nice and are very well modeled. You can even see the screw under your car when you turn over. Locked cars are in their "retail boxes" and you unbox them when purchasing them with game coins. That's just brilliant. You can also recolor them, which is a nice touch.\n\nThe game is fairly short and not too hard, but considering this is a game about toy cars, I'd say those are a plus. Toybox Turbos is just a really nice game to have in the Steam catalog to fill that tabletop racing niche.","December 23, 2015","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's a nice try but the make so many mistakes:\n\n- It automaticaly resets the view on loading screens. Every time you make yourself a comfortable distance (because the panels are far to close) it resets itself on the next loading screen.\n- The controls should be directional. That whould make it far nicer to control.\n- When a race is finished they move faster across the track in a finishing anmation. This is way to fast. I always get sick.\n- Also when the race ist finished and on loading screens a screen gets fixed in your view. Never do that in VR!!! It's so annoying like someone holding a paper in your face.\n- It dosn't support the actual oculus drivers. They didn't manage to update this for 6 months now.\n\nI downgraded my drivers but it's still super complicated to get the game running. You need to alt+enter it out of fullscreen, move it on the oculus screen and alt+enter it to fullscreen again. Sometimes the game crashes when you do this...\n\nThe game is nice, but: Don't buy this for VR !\n\n\n","January 23","false","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not the worst, but it definitely made the ranking.  The 3 options for the camera are awful, and it's more about learning the course and the shortcuts than anything else.  If the camera would just zoom out JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE, it would be worlds better.  But the camera isn't why I rage quit this awful game.\n\nComplaint #1.  After failing multiple times on a particular race, I won it by parking and waiting for initial item respawn after the cheating AI races ahead of you at the start (using slower vehicles, or the same vehicle you're using) and grabs all the items.  With smashy hammer in tow, I easily caught up and ended my fail streak.\n\nComplaint #2. I intentionally slow down my laps during escape races.  I'm pretty sure the wave's speed is tied to your average speed, because once I started doing slow/medium/fast laps I started 3 starring those.\n\nComplaint #3.  Many races were won by gunning into first from last place during the last lap to avoid being auto-targeted by the PC's who seem to love shooting at you but not each other.\n\nEnd synopsis: this game is utter ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•t.  It's not challenging, just frustrating.  The multiplayer looks like it might be fun, but the AI will possibly make you develop tourettes.","January 4","false","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has the excellent table top racing you will know and love if you have played any of the Micro Machines games. They have slightly changed the camera so that it follows the car, this makes it a lot easier for people not familiar with the top town view but you can turn on the old school camera if you prefer. There is a good variety of vehicles, both old favourites and new ones. The disappointing part however was the number of tracks and the length of the single player campaign. It feels like there are significantly fewer tracks and more limited locations compared to V4. So overall it is an enjoyable game but nostalgia for the Micro Machines games made me expected it to be better.","December 26, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
