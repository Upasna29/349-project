The developers were gracious during similar feedback from other players, and as they worked to improve the game, the clip became irrelevant and was discarded.]\n\nWhen the game begins, it seems that the developers are hoping to tell a substantial story about mental illness. But it falls apart immediately - whether by your character's goofy, 19th century diagnosis (neurasthenia!), swallowing meds with no clue which of your SIXTEEN traits was affected, or having maxed-out "Homicide" and "Psychosis" with no effect but blurry vision. Despite a successfully tense atmosphere, there's no substance here. The navigation and interface are a chore, and the developer's attempt to simulate psychosis are silly, and sometimes abrasive.\n\nAnd nothing makes sense. Click on the video playthrough posted above (by the developer), and listen to the commentary: "I'm dead! Well, it was for the best; I had absolutely not the first clue what to do next."

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thmanwithnoname/recommended/391120/","thmanwithnoname","noname","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thmanwithnoname/","5622 products in account","This game was reviewed using a code given to me by the developers for that purpose.\n\nIt's worth noting that this game is about 25% finished; It's not in early access, but the only playable chapter as of this review is chapter 1. (Of a planned 4)\n\n\nOkay, I'd like to be able to recommend this game. It has some interesting ideas, especially at the intersection of gameplay and story. However, at this point, I just can't. I think the devs are taking player experience into account, and have already made a few changes to chapter one. So, I do plan to come back to this game when the next chapter is released and see how it looks. I will edit this review when I do so.\n\nUpfront: I did not finish the first chapter. I haven't figured out how to progress very far. This game can be very obtuse, and there are no clear goals. I think that's in large part intentional. In this chapter you're playing a nine year old with mental issues. The confusion and lack of clear direction make sense in this setting.\nPersonally, I'd appreciate a little guidance, but people who are better at this kind of game than me might not have the same sort of issues.\n\nOne of the interesting gameplay//story decisions is to unlock the mouse cursor from the viewing mechanic. The game gives you the reasoning for the decision, which I appreciated, since I originally thought that it was just an un-squashed Unity bug.\nI have a real problem with this mechanic, however. Since I have more than one screen, it's trivially easy to mouse out of the game without realizing it, and then when I click outside of the game, the game minimizes and I drop to my desktop. It's incredibly annoying, and I can't imagine that it's an intended side effect.\nBasically, it's a really interesting concept, but the execution just makes it frustrating.\n\nNext design choice: You can't save your game. (Once more chapters are added, you'll be able to start from any chapter you've reached.) This means that short runs at this game won't do much for you.\nNot my favorite thing, but I don't mind this too much; it seems to be a stylistic choice, and I can't really argue with it. I don't particularly appreciate how it's implemented, however.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=529959059\nCondescending menus just aren't necessary, IMO.\n\nThere are no in-game options at all. (The unity launcher gives resolution + full screen choices)\nThe lack of brightness choices is intentional, made for atmosphere, but I think it's a misstep. I've pulled up a few gameplay videos from other places, and there systems are noticeably brighter than my system. I can't make out half of the details in my game that I could see in those videos. I don't want to have to change my monitor settings just for this game :(\nThere are also no options for sound. This isn't a complete deal breaker, but it seems silly to have to drop to windows to use the system volume controls just so I don't go deaf.\n\nThe movement isn't satisfying at all. As a child of nine, I expect quick, smooth movement. Based on my movement speed and the Foley for that movement I feel more like a tired dockworker than a child, no matter how depressed.\n\nThe stats are interesting, and they serve as much as a teaser of what kind of stuff you might encounter as anything else. Not sure how some of them are going to be used, but it could be kinda interesting.\n\nThere are a few glitches I've run into: sometimes onscreen text runs over itself to the point of complete illegibility, and I've been chased down and killed by a human that was already dead. (not like a zombie, this character was killed, and the model was splayed out on the floor. then it started following me and killed me while I was trying to figure out what was going on.) http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=529965947\n\nThis review, as I re-read it, focuses heavily on the negatives, but I don't meant to say that it's terrible or anything like that. It has potential, and it interests me quite a bit, but there's not a lot I can say - in part because of how far I got - without being really spoilery. I also want to point out the problems, because I think they're interesting AND important to notice.\n\nTo sum this up, I can't recommend this game now, but I hope to be able to in the future. I can't assign a number grade, but it's not far below positive for me.","October 4, 2015","false","2.1"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","28","36","2","5"

Many games advertise “No Handholding”, but I don’t believe it’s ever been so true before. Certainly not in any game I’ve played. If you find something, or accomplish something, or learn something, it is significant, and very rewarding. "The Archetype" provides few hints of any kind.This is a game where you learn from failure, and can expect to play over and over, getting a little further each game (or not.) Quite possibly you will have at least 10 hours in "The Archetype" before you ultimately succeed in the first chapter.\n\nYou are Archty, a nine-year old boy with severe emotion and mental issues. Your father is a violent alcoholic, and your mother and three siblings have arrived to your father’s creepy, dark mansion where the two of you live. And, except for your father, they all promptly disappeared. That is ALL you know.\n\nBut that’s far from the sum total of Archty’s troubles. The house is also inhabited by some sort of demon(s), and they do nothing to calm Archty’s anxious mood. So, Archety must attempt to stay calm while searching for his family (or whatever happened to them), evading his bat-wielding, drunken father…and avoiding demons (and worse!). All in real-(game)time. And almost everything upsets the poor child, quite understandably.\n\nA dozen psychological traits are constantly monitored in “The Archetype”. Traits such as anger, jealousy, sadness, and nine more. Also, four more significant issues: suicide, neurosis, homicide and psychosis (I think that’s correct.). If any of the four pass a score of 50 (on the way to top out at 100) Archty’s world becomes very troubled, and those issues must be addressed. Medication can be found occasionally, but can’t be saved in inventory. And if any of the four reach 100……..\n\nThis is the first of four chapters which take place throughout Archty's life, and they should each be released about two months after the prior chapter.\n\nThere is one aspect of “The Archetype” that is unique in my experience; the cursor. It isn’t dead center, it floats on the screen based on the movement of Archty, and how his POV changes. It’s an interesting choice, but in a game this dark (figuratively and literally) it becomes frustrating to locate the dark cursor against a dark background, with only an edge lit for contrast. Easier with time and practice.\n\nThere are some aspects of the game potential buyers of “The Archetype” need to know. First, there currently is no means by which to adjust screen brightness, and that’s deliberate (and significant to the atmosphere.) This is so significant that the DEVs actually recommend that the game ONLY be played in the dark. Since not all gamers have this option, it must be considered sooner, rather than later. It also might seem to fail to take into consideration different PCs baselines, the changes in brightness when playing with battery power, and differences in vision (such as with age. I have one game with eight settings for colorblindness alone), but perhaps not, as the DEVS seem very deliberate in all things. There have been discussions about a slider to compensate for these numerous variables, as is commonly used in games. ("The Archetype" has only been out for a matter of days at this point, so do doubt numerous positive changes are yet to be made.) On a separate topic, please be aware that there has also been an issue concerning a genuine 911 call used in the game WITH PERMISSION. That is no longer a concern, as a suitable replacement has been made.\n\nThe first time one tries to save “The Archetype” gamers will learn that the feature will not be available until a certain point in the game is reached by the player, and that will likely be after a minimum of an hour of game time. I’ve played 3 - 4 hours (offline, mostly), died 6 – 8 times and haven’t reached that point yet. Also, at this time there is no PAUSE feature (though it is being discussed), so the game will continue while you answer the door or check the baby. At some points in the game the issue is minimal, at others, significant. (Again, in discussion.)\n\nBut “fear not!” (except where appropriate, of course), the DEVs of “The Archetype” are very attentive and concerned about their game. Even in just a few days, the number of ideas and suggestions from many gamers that have been responded to is quite reassuring. There have been updates EVERY 2 - 3 days. There seems to be an excellent possibility that “The Archetype” will turn out to be a very special game.\n\nEDIT: Having completed Chapter One, I can say that in retrospect, it's fairly simple (except for one action that I don't believe is in any way intuitive, and is counter to every other similar action in the game, but can be found in the correct Youtube walkthrough.) And there seems to be no means of saving, only of completion, which I presume counts as a "save" for the complete, four-part game.\n\n(As with most Steam games, offline game time is not tracked.)","September 20, 2015","true","4.4"," 28 of 43 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","28","43","0","0"

The camera and controls are a bit wobbly to presumably simulate the mental disorders our protagonist is suffering from. You start out in a dark room and the game leaves little direction to the player, letting you explore the game world on your own. An interesting mechanic this game introduces are the psychosis and psychological meters. As you explore the game world, certain objects trigger feelings and emotions in Archty that increase these meters. For example, watching a bottle drop will frighten Archty and increase his fear level, and finding a painting by his mom will increase Archty’s depression/solitude meters. As these meters increase, gameplay will drastically change to reflect the changes in Archty’s psychological condition (for example, controls become inverted, you hear other sounds/hallucinations etc).\n\nThis game shows a lot of promise and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys horror atmospheric games.\n","September 20, 2015","true","0.9"," 23 of 38 people (61%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","61","23","38","5","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/recommended/391120/","LadyTenjoin","LadyTenjoin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LadyTenjoin/","983 products in account","The Archetype is an episodic indie horror game that puts us in the shoes of Archty Tolomei, a 9 years old boy suffering from several mental illnesses (schizophrenia, for instance), emotional and physical abuse from his mother and father (respectively). Each episode will contain a piece of Archty’s life, ranging from his adolescent years to his last moments on Earth.\n\nRight now, I can only discuss chapter 1 since it’s the only chapter available at the moment. This review will be updated as more chapters are added.\n\nIn Chapter 1, we explore Archty’s childhood home. His mother and sisters have vanished mysteriously while his drunken father locks himself in his room, leaving Archty to fend for himself. With nothing to do, we begin searching around and uncover the truth of how the rest of his family vanished so suddenly. The story is mostly told through the notes scattered in his decrepit home and several side comments made by Archty when he encounters objects that either frightens him or bring about memories from the past. I like the story and following Archty’s tale might be an interesting adventure.\n\nThe game’s main feature is controlling Archty’s mental health and stabilizing him when he approaches anything that rattles him. Displayed on the HUD are 8 emotional traits: fear, despair, anxiety, envy, jealousy, sadness, anger, and guilt. The other 4 are libido, aggression, depression and solitude (I’m separating these 4 because they’re not exactly emotions.) These 12 influences the 4 main mental statuses. Archty can become suicidal, neurotic, psychotic and homicidal. Each are given a numerical value (0-100. 0 being neutral and 100 being, dangerous…we’re stepping into the…danger zone).\n\nFor example, at 100 anger and aggression, I observed that Archty’s homicidal tendencies are brought forward. If you disturb Archty’s father in his room, at this condition, Archty is allowed to pick up either a gun or/and an axe (both are openly found in the house for some reason) and repel the father (btw Archty has a hell of a throw if you use an axe to “take care” of the father.) There are other ways to influence Archty’s mental statuses but it’s up to the player to figure that out for themselves.\n\nThe mouse cursor is also detached from the camera, so the cursor doesn’t always follow the camera. You might be turning the camera to the right but the cursor is at the bottom of the screen. This is added to simulate Archty’s inability to focus very well due to his mental issue. This feature is annoying at the beginning and I simply had to adapt when interacting with doors and items. I wish this is optional because I just want to click “E” to select stuff. The HUD can be messy to look at with all traits on the screen at once but that is easily fixed by hiding it.\n\nSo far, the game isn’t scary but there are times when the situation shifts its direction and becomes more unsettling. Namely, when Archty is experiencing his psychotic episodes, he begins to hear whispers (random voices playing backwards). He will start hallucinating (the screen will start shaking, coupled with bright lights and impaired vision. I cannot say in confidence that this represents what a person with Schizophrenia would see through one of their episodes, however, I’ve worked with a couple of children with Schizophrenia, and some of the symptoms these kids have experienced (hearing voices that aren’t their own, clicking, visual hallucinations) are present in the game. The developers attempt to mimic them.\n\nThe two hostiles in the game, the mother and father, aren’t as threatening as you would think, with the dad wielding a bat, and the mother being a ghost, these two turned into the comic relief of the game. I say that because while I was playing, their AI was exploitable because they would not attack when I was near them. Giving them a bear hug is fine but walking away from them hurts their feelings so much, they want to kill you. I believe this will be patched but I found this glitch hilarious.\n\nThere is a scavenger hunt in the first chapter, in a form of gathering ingredients for a ritual to destroy a clingy apparition and I needed some time to gather them all. It took me about 5 hours to finish the first chapter. I got stuck for a bit.\n\nThe graphics is nothing to preach about. They’re pre-made assets from the Unity asset store so most likely, you’ll recognize the environment. Also, besides from the configuration menu that comes along any Unity game, there are no other graphical options. My small problem with the game is that there is no way to turn up the brightness. There is a flashlight but in my opinion, the throw of the light is terrible. I found myself squinting at times. That’s just me though.\n\nI have no problems in turns of framerate drops and crashes but I’ve witness several non-gamebreaking bugs that ruins the atmosphere at times. I have read people reporting of crashing during start-up and I am unsure if this has been resolved. The developers are responsive and I’ve already brought to their attention several problems I have with their game.\nAll and all, chapter 1 is an okay start for The Archetype. It’s enough for me to want to see what happens next.\n\nTL;DR\n\nPros:\n- Interesting story\n- Intriguing game mechanics (controlling Archty’s mental health can be difficult to manage)\n- Might bring some awareness to the mental illnesses mentioned in the game\n- Atmosphere can be unsettling at times\n\nCons:\n- Buggy\n- AI is exploitable\n- Interacting with doors and items can be irritating\n- Game is too dark (needs brightness option)\n- Bare graphical options\n- Reported crashes from a few players (not sure it’s solved yet)\n\nIf you’re somewhat interested in trying out the game after reading (or skimming) my take on The Archetype, I have a few keys I can giveaway. All I need you to do is say something in the comments below and I will pick the “winners” later throughout the week. Thanks for reading and have a nice day.\n\nBtw, if you have the time, here is a video of me fooling around in The Archetype\n\nThe Archetype Video","September 20, 2015","true","6.1"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","14","27","0","10"

If you are uncomfortable with harsh topics such as abuse and alcoholism, this game is not for you. As well as that, if you are easily frustrated or frightened, this is not the game for you. The Archetype, while having an end-goal, offers no explicit objectives beyond 'explore' and will not hold your hand in the slightest. It can be scary, it can be confusing, and that is the point. It's not just a standard game, it's bringing you into the world of this scared young boy with multiple mental issues.\n\nHaving finished the Archetype last night, I am very excited for Chapter 2's release (episodic format). The moment the game began, I could feel the dread and very quickly got my first scare. Note that this is not a game that relies on jump-scares, but rather a well-crafted and atmospheric game with the occasional nasty surprise in store.  Nine  year old schitzophrenic Archty, who also suffers from Generalized Anxiety Disorder, is home alone except for his alcoholic father. I admit, while loving the idea of the 16 emotional bars and how they affect Archty, I was skeptical before buying this game. Many works have included schizophrenia and yet portrayed people with schizophrenia poorly, either by making them automatically cloudcookoolander or exaggerating them. This work treated the subject well, as well as including another condition, General Anxiety Disorder. All of this felt treated respectfully and accurately, which is a well done to the developers.\n\nRecently I emailed the devs. and discovered a lot of the aspects that I thought of as bugs were actually features, added in such a way that they're not-obvious, but clear once you think about it. Of course, when you're running in fear, you can't exactly stop to think, which acts to that tension. As well as this though, the devs are extremely respondent to player wishes. I've read online several mentions of changes that have been made due to player wishes before I bought this game, and there's already talks of further updates. This game isn't early access level, but it is still being refined.\n\nNow, the game isn't perfect. It can be bumpy at steps. There may some mild glitches that affect gameplay;  However, the dev is quick to respond to any reports. Despite some annoyance and frustration, I would recommend this game to anybody looking for a good horror game with a rich storyline. I'm currently planning to explore the game again for Easter Eggs and alternative options in certain encounters, of which a fair few exist.","October 7, 2015","true","5.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

I was able to play the game during development and became friends with the developers, so I may not be the most objective reviewer.\n\nThis is a very ambitious game. The overwhelming majority of Steam first-person horror games are virtual walking simulators with perhaps an enemy or two to run from.  This game goes beyond all of that with a lot of interesting mechanics and also a story that is more than just written on notes that you find lying around.  You're an actual character living out a story that goes far beyond the "waking up with amnesia in a haunted house" thing that's been done to death.  You truly feel for the protagonist.\n\nOne very interesting mechanic is a full psychological system that tracks every facet of your mood.  I would give examples of how this impacts you, but I don't want to give away any spoilers.  Let's just say you need to be cognizant of your mood as you play as it could take some control away from you and limit your options.  Overall, it's a very smart system that I enjoyed quite a bit.\n\nThe scares are pretty solid.  The sound design is okay to above average and provides a good, spooky atmosphere with the occasional, well-done jump scare.  The graphics are excellent and put together extraordinarily well.  This is certainly no asset flip as you see so often.  The enemies are literally scary, particularly the second one you come to, not just random monsters walking about.  Overall, I'd say this is all quite well done.\n\nThere are some things you need to know, however, in order to make an informed decision.  Personally, I love the game, but I know how picky some people can be, and there may be things here that will turn you off; for instance, there are only 2 resolutions, 720 and 1080.  There is no brightness setting.  The mouse, by design, is detached from the screen (you are supposed to be psychotic and have a difficult time with everyday acts).  Additionally, there isn't always much in the way of direction on what to do.  Also, there are bugs here and there, but I'm confident those will be worked out by the devs.  Overall, the game could use a little more polish, but is still a great experience to me.\n\nAlso, I should point out that the game is being released in four chapters, with only the first being currently available.\n\nIf you are a fan of complex horror and aren't afraid of the rough edges, I'd say this is an excellent buy.  You can certainly feel the love that was put into this game in all the little touches here and there.","September 21, 2015","true","0.3"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","39","7","18","2","0"

First time I've played through this game, I've opened the door to daddy's room which let to him clubbing me to death in the baby's room.  Second time I've played through, I've become so neurotic that I've decided to kill my father, so I picked up the axe, and in a fit of rage, buried it in his face, then, out of guilt, I called 911 to confess to the murder, as well as to my uncle, and although they banged on the door, they never came in.  I want to see how this affects the rest of the story, but really, I want closure to the first chapter without having to get killed or clicking on the "Please, let me out" button.\n\nAlso, I understand the whole "lack of focus" mechanic, but it's kind of annoying to have to scroll the mouse around to orient myself.\n\nOverall, despite the primitive graphics and recycled sound effects, this game is well worth looking into.","September 16, 2015","true","1.3"," 20 of 59 people (34%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","34","20","59","0","2"

FIrst off, this game is very creepy and the subject matter is not at all suitable for children and may give some adults nightmares. It's a thrilling game, and as you play and certain attributes, like fear, panic, anger, sadness, etc. increase, the play control changes ( forward becomes strafe left or right, strafe left or right becomes forward, backwards changes to strafe right or left and so on). This game, though creepy does have some comic relief (check the cell phone at the beginning of the game). It gave me goose bumps at times and other times got my heart pounding. The devs delve into psychological and spiritual horror as if they have experienced it. Although this certainly isn't the normal type of game I play, I think fans of horror would find it compelling and hard to put down. The graphics are great and though the lighting is low it's not too dark to be playable.","September 19, 2015","true","0.1"," 3 of 23 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","3","23","0","0"

I have, just shy of 20 hrs. into this game. I am still on chapter one. But now I have a positive outcome, completed. Is this normal? I sure hope not!......Going forward with Chapter 2 and beyond! The game was distressing,(for me on a personal level).....But hind sight being 20/20 like it is.....It is not as bad as it seems....To a point.\n\nUpdate: Distressing 911 call removed....Replaced with text. Some bugs fixed. A note found in a cabinet,(that pretty much explained what needs to be done, to achieve positive outcome). Replaced with a doctors letter, regarding Archty's mental and home life conditions.\n\nI am leaving a positive recommendation for this game. Although, in the beginning I had my doubts. It is a decent game. Easy to say, now that I know what to do. But I have played much worse. This game really makes you work for it. No doubt......Leave no stone unturned! Check anything and everything!\n\nBut, I am looking forward to the next 20 hrs. it will take me, for Chapter 2.......probably more!","September 17, 2015","true","21.5"," 7 of 33 people (21%) found this review helpful","21","7","33","0","3"

I feel it gives a great, creeping horror kind of feeling, which I get a lot more enjoyment out of than constant jumpscares, which tend to wear thin after a while.  The disconnected controls can sometimes make things a little difficult to focus your view on, but with what Archty has going on in his head...well...it just ends up adding something to it.  It starts to feel like a disconnect between your hands and your mind, which actually ends up being a pretty effective way to express his instability..It's not easy for him to focus on things, so why have his focus be locked to the center of the screen? It ends up disorienting you, forcing you to focus more on what you're trying to do, so that when the game does unleash one of its scares on you, it catches you completely off-guard because you'll glimpse something out of the corner of your eye, question whether you saw it or not, then get hit in the face with it when you go for a second look.  So I can see how it can be frustrating, but thematically I feel like it really makes sense.\n\nNow that the game's released, I definitely plan to start going through and seeing how various things affect the different states, there's chances for a lot of things here, and for it being a first game from a 2 person team, I was impressed.  Definitely can't wait to see the effects the events of Chapter 1 are going to leave on Archty in the coming chapters, especially as the team hones their skills to the fine point of an ice pick, to bury in our mental states.","September 19, 2015","true","0.3"," 4 of 28 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","4","28","0","2"
