This has so much potential!\nRegarding the advertising, call this game early access if you want. Its disingenuous to ask people to pay for an incomplete product.\n\nPerhaps you don't understand the significant difference between "mostly positive" and "overwhemlingly positive", from the point of view of both steam's algorithm, and for the user.  All you need to get rid of the negative reviews is to add a "training mode" where you can mouse over kanji and see a card showing the description.\n\nPros\n- Nice soundtrack\n- Does contain all the kanji it claims to\n\nCons\n- No tracking of what you learn. If you could just keep stats on which symbols you got wrong, that alone would make this game worthwhile\n- The game needs atleast an endless mode. Where it redraws the board and doesn't repeat kanji until you get through all of those in the set.\n- Typos in game\n\nYou can't use this game to learn but you can use it to solidify what you've learned.\n\nI'm putting down a yes because its usable as is, but the game is sorely lacking and should not have been published like this. I hope the dev pushes updates soon.","March 13","true","0.1"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

However, knowing that this dev is responsive and that they want to improve and build this title even more. Specially after talking to them personally, I will upgrade my rating to a recommendation with caution.\n\nThis will not replace apps like iKana or iKanji. Or games like "My Japanese Coach". It should be considered more a compliment to others and possibly the groundwork towards something better.\n\nIf you are on the fence, I recommend checking the forums first and seeing where the development is at. Ask questions about if it does or does not have a feature you want. This dev seems to care more about making games than getting money so hopefully this will mean they'll continue to update and build upon this as a labor of love.\n\nUltimately this should probably be labeled an Alpha so consider it as such for now.","September 24, 2015","true","0.3"," 15 of 20 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","15","20","0","0"

At least not in any traditional sense.  You are presented with a bunch of tiles showing a character with the name or meaning above and you have to click on the right tile to move on.  If you don't know, you just keep clicking.  This is where the "training" could happen in that it BRIEFLY tells you what the one you clicked on is, but if you can memorize things that quickly, you're better off picking up an actual Japanese language book from the bookstore.\n\nThere is less game to it than a visual novel.  And it's certainly less interesting as well.  If you already know Japanese and want a little bit of practice you might consider this when it's on the cheap, but then you probably already have practice materials.\n\nAs others have said -- this is seriously misrepresented.","September 30, 2015","false","3.6"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

You basically guess at tiles and when you pick the right one it disappears immediately so it can't stick in your mind.  It's not the way to teach and it's not fun.  The first very simple fix is to show the meaning on hover so one has time to absorb.  There is obviously an origin to each character and many characters are similar so it should get into those things in a 'training mode' and provide some hooks for learning.  I WILL spend more time with it but I hope the devs study the human learning process and align this 'learning' 'game' with that.\nReview after an update:  Better because the right choice does not disappear but it's still not training.  There would need to be some kind of 'fun' schooling or training mode before each test to be both fun and educational.  I am still spending time with it because I really want to learn the characters so I hope it's expanded and I can give a thumbs up.","September 24, 2015","false","5.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","2"

I agree, you don't learn Japanese from the ground up. If you want a program that does everything, you will have to look elsewhere and expect to pay a lot more money. However, this program compliments any form of book or online study that involves reading and recognition. Even at entry level this program is useful, because quizzing yourself is essential, if you hope to get anywhere.\n\nWhen you launch the game, beginners can select hiragana and katakana quizzes. Once those are mastered, you can devote more time to the different grades of kanji. I don't know what constitutes a grade, but I find each one manageable and not overwhelming.\n\nEach quiz is random, but if you repeat a quiz 5 to 10 times a session, you will notice the value of doing so. Some kanji repeats while others are introduced. I find it easy to take note of the kanji I don't know, study them in my spare time and do another session of multiple quizzes at a later time. I also look up words related to the kanji I learned in a previous quiz and expand my vocabulary a little. Kanji is intimidating. The game seems to take the confusion out of knowing where to begin, so it is a big timesaver.\n\nI'm learning Japanese as a hobby, so I don't want to spend a lot of money on online classes or foreign language software. I use books, websites, and communicate with a few Japanese friends on Facebook regularly, so this program suits my needs perfectly. I highly recommend it to anyone in a similar situation. Sure, this program could use a few fixes and added features, but if you prefer something that compliments speaking, grammar, or an overall more comprehensive material like stroke order or background, look elsewhere.","October 2, 2015","true","11.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

It gives you a character from the Japanese language with many options to choose from.  This is helpful for memorizing and quickly identifying the characters.  Many people are quick to point out that there are no lessons in the game and that it won't actually teach you anything, however after being tested on several kanji that I didn't previously know I found out that looking at all the options and trying again and again to figure out which one it was made me remember it much better than simply being told, this kanji means this.  Also I found being quizzed and getting a little better over time, due to learning, oddly addicting.","January 2","true","2.8"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","5","7","0","0"

For a touchscreen laptop about the size of a 10" tablet, this could be ideal for the 1st month of the 1st semester of a college Japanese class because of the kana charts in combination with the kana tests.  As the kanji charts are not there, I don't see it being useful for studying kanji from an efficiency standpoint.\n\nIf you have a summer of time to burn, and you really want to know Japanese, I recommend "Modern Japanese: A Basic Reader" Volume 1 and Volume 2 (Hibbet, Itasaka. Harvard University Press).  It's old and it's hard, but it's got all the kana and over 2000 kanji and a lot of reading in one course... assuming you survive, you could feel like you graduated a low end Japanese high school.  Seriously though, don't even think you can do that course in a month.  Get a ream of printer paper, a pack of pens, and copy the 60 chapters of vocabulary in Volume 1.  Then study what you copied.  Then copy the reading from Volume 2 and use the vocabulary you copied from Volume 1 as pieces to a puzzle until the puzzle is solved.  Repeat 60 times since there are 60 chapters.  Find three months and hit it hard.  Very hard.","February 2","true","0.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
