As soon as i started playing the game, maxing out every setting available, i was amazed by two things, the first one being the fact that the game ran pretty darn well, and the second one being the fact that the game looked a little bit poorly, even from memory of having played the original Hard Reset a couple of weeks ago, i could tell there was something wrong about the textures, they look... just... Muddy.\n\nMy fears were disregarded by a wave of hand coming from my head until i actually saw a comparison video on youtube about the game missing crucial things to enhance it's graphical fidelity, things like ambient occlusion, things like reflections, and lighting, or in my case, even the textures, i don't know what was the reason behind this "downgrade" but it's a sad thing that you keep announcing this game as a "remastered edition" from the original when in reality all that it does is add one new weapon, which i haven't even found yet, as well as a couple of small gameplay changes, like the dashing from Shadow Warrior for example.\n\nWhat's the point of remastering a game, to downgrade it's graphics in the first place? I'm not even asking for better graphics, but what you're basically charging me for it's to play the game with only one new weapon, one new dashing move, a couple of balancing changes, and that's it, i hope to see some kind of patch, or something that at the very least brings up the graphics up to par with the original release.\n\nThe original, as well as this one, are great games, but when you're remastering something, the whole idea behind it it's to make the product in question better, not worse in any way, i don't understand... Maybe it was an accident... Who knows?","June 3","false","2.2"," 249 of 330 people (75%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","75","249","330","7","16"

The 2011 game was notorious for being really difficult because of the limited movement and hard hitting enemies that are bullet sponges on the higher difficulties. I loved the old game because of its' fast paced action as well as its unforgiving gameplay, despite its' faults.\n\nI played the Redux on Insane and have just started the Exile levels at this time of writing.\n\nOverall it is a decent update gameplay wise, but there seems to be a number of things that I feel are pointless or don't really integrate well. I'll start with the changes I noticed that were good:\n\nThe enemies are no longer bullet sponges (except for the grenadier) which definitely makes the game less tedious\nThe dash and sprinting mechanic from the Shadow Warrior reboot makes it much easier to dodge dangerous melee attacks. You also seem to have infinite sprint.\nThe damage of the little saw bots has been toned down so you don't die in one hit, which could happen very easily in the original\nSome of the enemy spawns have been changed which I think adds to the variety compared to the original\nThe new human enemies I found were a pretty cool addition\nThere is now music in Survival Mode\nGame runs flawlessly on an FX-8350 and R9-270X on Ultra\nThe Redux is also moderately easier than before; the game seems to tolerate alot more mistakes and I have only died twice so far.\n\nThese are things I think are negative or pointless changes:\n\nThe "Cyber Katana", although a cool enough weapon, I found was pointless because melee in a game like this is somewhat dangerous plus trying to switch between all 3 weapons is somewhat annoying\nThe updated graphics are barely noticable, even on ultra\nThe weapons are alot more clunkier to use; it takes a little longer to switch between the various modes and sometimes they are not responsive (like the smartgun lock-on)\nSome of the weapon animations are missing or are just less fluid. Compare the new grenade launcher with the original and you'll see what I mean.\nSome of the grunts from Shadow Warrior's Lo Wang have been added (such as when dashing or using the katana)  which is really misplaced\nVery minor nitpick, but the gui's used to unlock doors and whatnot, is no longer interative like in Doom 3, which the original game used\nAnother minor nitpick, but in survivial mode, there is no longer any damage or enemy health modifiers.\nI have also encoutered a bug where the game would alt-tab and say it crashed, but it actually didn't and was able to continue like normal. This didn't happen in the old game but it did in Shadow Warrior. There have been mentions of becoming frozen at the upgrade machines but I haven't experienced that.\n\n\nAll in all, I'm sorry to say but this Redux hasn't really done anything groundbreaking. There have been some good changes but I feel they do not warrant a whole new remake of the original. If you liked or hated the original and loved Shadow Warrior then try it out and form your own opinion on it. If you haven't played the original, you'll probably find this alright, but I recommend you grab the original first. However, if you are a Hard Reset purist or just hate the idea of remakes like this, then don't pick it up (except if you can get the discount)\n\nAs for me, I think I'll stick with the original.","June 3","false","4.8"," 178 of 244 people (73%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","73","178","244","9","13"

A cyberpunk first person shooter.  Flying Wild Hog studio is well known for another other game, Shadow Warrior. The original game was not released on the consoles, so it is nice to see them get some love in this improved release of the title.\n\nThe game play does not differ from the original. You play through a grim world set in the future where the landscape is completely overrun by robots. These robots are the reason for the human race becoming near extinct. Your job, playing as Major Fletcher, is to face these dangerous enemies and fight for your races’ future.\n\nCombat is very fast paced and hectic, leaving the player often facing hordes of enemies at once and some pretty powerful bosses too. You have access to multiple different types of weapons, a multi-function rifle, which can be improved to include attachments such as RPGs, grenade launchers, shotguns or mines, or a futuristic canon which has similar attachments, and this version of the game also comes with a new weapon, a cyber-katana sword. I can only assume this comes from the Shadow Warrior game as it plays very similar to how the melee combat works in that game. The other new feature to the game play, is the ability to perform quick dodges, this allows the player to easily manoeuvre out of the way of the enemies attacks and melee swings with a little finesse, rather than bunny hopping around the map. This quick dodge can also be used to zip across the map at speed.  The boss fights are challenging, as they incorporate waves of enemies as well different mechanics in order to defeat them. The level design is pretty well set out too; there was only a handful of times where I was completely lost and couldn’t work out where to go, each mission’s path is fairly linear, but it does allow for moments of exploration into side rooms and secret areas for extra loot and experience.\n\nGraphically, Hard Reset Redux has been improved significantly, utilizing the latest version of the Road Hog engine. The upgrade features better lighting and special effects, on top of a generally snappier game in terms of performance too. The voice acting is few and far between, but sound effects were all on point.\n\nIf you played the original game, you may notice that some of the levels were shortened, or as the developers put it, “re-balanced” to allow for a better pace of game play. That being said, I managed to get just over seven hours of game play out of a single play through this game. The option for a New Game+ mode is also present upon finishing which is something I will definitely be giving ago.  The lack of a multiplayer mode may prove to be a slight error on the dev’s part, as the longevity of the game will not last more than two play throughs at the very least.\n\nI really enjoyed my time playing through the improved version of Hard Reset – it had been a few years since I played the original so it was nice to revisit this game – it is definitely improved in both gameplay and the technical side of the game. Owners of the original game on Steam will be happy to hear they will get a heavy discount on Redux (85% off) which is well worth it! Personally I am not sure it is worth the full price of $19.99 – if you don’t have the original, you may want to wait for the sale season.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up.

To Redux or Not to Redux\nOk Hard Rest is a pretty good game, being i have the old version and played it i can say its  pretty neat game. Ok now for the Hard Reset Redux Review! My issue with this i guess when you make a game that already looked real good this upgrade only seems marginal in the looks department to me.  But the updated game Engine does seem to run and load a lot faster and seems to run very smooth,so thats a good + there. Gfx are cleaned up a bit and the lighting is a bit better then the old one.\n\nAs for the controls they are the same, your standard FPS set up! I do like the new Dash mechanic ! Make's getting out of the way from the chargeing ones better!\n\nRan into one bug so far with the Upgrade Stations you cant back out or log off....All you do is stand there and cant move,when you turn all the way around your gun comes up but cant move or log out of the staion...So too bypass this issue till patched just save the game and reload from eatch station. Seems this bug us due to rebinding keys  {As long as they dont charge us for a patch or a new Redux of the Redux j/k lol }\n\nBut i like what they done to it even though im not 100% onboard with gaming company's or dev's asking for more cash  for a game i already own.....If the game is more then 10 years old or older im down but one that isnt that old and still runs fine on todays systems and OS's i see no need for this. I think it should be a upgraded patch or just added for Free to all that own the original game.\n\nSo final verdict is a Buy :)","June 3","true","6.7"," 81 of 120 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","81","120","7","19"

The story was told through comic strip style images, and voice dialog. The graphics in the Redux version are improved from the original, but it wasn’t such a significant upgrade that I was blown away by them. Much like the original, the music and sound effects were done well, and the voice acting wasn’t amazing, but it was decent. The story is the same as in the original; it was decently written, but as my second time playing the game, I was more focused on just killing stuff.\n\nPros:the new quick dash ability is THE best addition that was made to the game\ncyber-katana is also a very good addition against certain types of enemies\nfun, fast-paced combat, with a run and gun style using little to no cover while lots of enemies rush at you (plus lots of explosions!)\nkilling enemies and finding secrets earns currency that lets you buy weapon and character upgrades to better fit your playstyle\nCons:brief delay every time the game auto-saved\nsmall delay when changing weapon modes (but it was easy to dash away to buy time)\nsome minor bugs where some objects behaved strangely when you would walk into things causing the objects to go flying\nweird bug where I dashed down a flight of stairs, and I died for absolutely no reason - I had no idea what happened, but it only happened once ever\nI played the game on normal mode since I remembered the original being very difficult in some parts, but the Redux version was a lot easier than the original was. The new quick dash move makes life so much easier to dodge enemies, and just create a little breathing room. For me, the next best thing was the new cyber-katana that was added. At first I thought it was terrible weapon, since I thought being in melee range would just get me killed, but against certain types of enemies, this sword is fantastic! I used it a lot more than I thought I would, and it was really fun to use.\n\nThere were two other weapon types, but each type you can upgrade into completely different gun modes. Most of the weapon types were very useful in different circumstances, but there were a few that I felt were mediocre at best, so I didn’t really use them.\n\nIf you’re expecting DOOM, Hard Reset Redux is not up to par, but it’s still a similar style of combat, and fun to play. The game took me about 5 hours to complete, and this was the second time I played through the campaign. The dash ability and katana was great additions to the game, and I enjoyed the Redux playthrough much more than the original.\n\nIt was almost four years ago that I played the original Hard Reset, and I had gotten it for dirt cheap in a bundle. I liked the original back then, and wanted to play it again, so I had no problem spending three bucks on the Redux version; it was worth it to me.","June 4","true","6.2"," 49 of 69 people (71%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","71","49","69","4","4"

The new dash mechanic feels great and I can run the game on my less-than good computer so the new graphics engine helps me out as well.\n\nThe rebalance pacing is good, so far the combat pacing has felt really good too, controls feel tight, enemies are fun to kill- watching parts of them blow off and then they start to crawl toward you.\n\nThe only complaint I have is when you get stuck and aren't sure where to go next- but this has always been an issue with me when it comes to old style FPS's so I'll leave it up to you how much you dislike that sort of thing.\n\nBasically buy this game if you just want to blow ♥♥♥♥ up in a fast-paced combat environment with lots of explosions and destruction.

They decided to ride on Shadow Warrior's success and to take elements from it to add them into Hard Reset : the player is now able to dash in all 4 directions and can use a katana (acquired around 2 hours into the game).\n\nJust so we're clear on the new content, we're talking moves that are directly taken from Shadow Warrior, with the same animations.\nThere are also new "human" enemies, but we're talking about reskinned version of previously existing enemies, the "human looking" robots, which were dreskinned with some human skins we could already see in the game... It does feel very cheap.\n\nThey also changed a few combat situations by swapping some enemies here or adding some there. Some of that includes enemies from the old DLC added to the original levels. This is the good part of this version, if you enjoyed the original, it is worth replaying it just for those new combat situations... However,  only about 1 or 2 fights per level got changed! This is very light!\n\nNow the issues this version brings up.... Originally you could not dash, and you could only sprint forward. Now, not only you can dash in all four directions for as long as you want to, but that dash is a lot faster than the sprinting (sprint move which has therefore become completely useless).\nThe good thing with the dash is that it makes the game faster paced.... The bad thing is that the enemies AI were not updated in consequence of the new moves. The enemies are still designed with in mind, a player who can only sprint forward and not at a great speed...\n\nThe result is that this new dash move allows you to outmaneuver every enemy very easily. MANY of the game's enemies have attacks which are based on rushing towards the player, but now, you can easily dash in any direction to get away.\n\nIn the original game, the fun and skill of the game came from predicting the enemies attack and reacting quick enough, but now you can simply f**k around not caring so much, and get away from most situation with a couple of simples dashes.\n\nAs for the katana, it can become useful against rusher enemies and in close-up situations. However, the original game's balance is based around managing two different ammo types, using one not to run out of the other and vice versa. A huge part of this balance and ammo management is screwed because the katana doesn't use any ammo at all, and lets you get away with bad weapon management...\n\nIn other words the balance of the game has been completely screwed, and it requires a lot less skill to be good at the game.\n\nIf you have never played Hard Reset, play the original game first. Then play Redux if you like the game enough.\nRecommended for fans of the game only.","June 3","true","16.4"," 32 of 46 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","32","46","0","2"

The dash movement is nice and the load times are definitely a lot faster. It seems to be even better optimized than before but that's expected since this is, after all, made for consoles now.

And at the discounted price, in particular for Shadow Warrior owners, you get a reasonable old school FPS action at its core. The gunplay is fun with most of the weapons, as there's a satisfaction you get when tearing an enemy apart with bullets. There's specific area damage that means you can tear apart an enemy, leading to enemies to claw toward you with one claw, slowly but surely. And at first, it really does a good job of giving that old school feel. The problem is that, it stays around a bit too long. Don't get me wrong, if you like the basic action of the old school FPS, it's here. It just doesn't do enough in the variety area to keep up the action, and it'll fall into a slog. The difficulty has been reduced a bit from the original, and that detracts from the game in the end. There's a lot of little annoying things about the game: as new additions push the game to be even easier for no reason, while questionable design decisions regarding controls (f1 and f2 to switch guns? Really?) don't make a lot of sense. Luckily, it's the price for those Shadow Warrior owners in particular that really sells the game here. It's a niche purchase for FPS fans in the standard case, but at that 85% discount, you get a bang for your buck, and you really can't ask for more then that.\n\nVideo Review:  https://youtu.be/xKKnKMn8ymU\n\nLists:\nPositives:\nThe gunplay is solid. Each gun (with the exception of the smartgun) feels satisfying to use, and has little touches. The shifting gun mechanic is a nice change of pace.\nAction FPS roots are still present here, and when things get chaotic, things get really fun. It's at its best when its throwing everything and the kitchen sink at you.\nEnvironmental hazards are fun to use, but also has consequences if used without thought. Hurray for chain explosions!\nThere's a lot of secrets to find, and some of them really do a good job of reward exploration and creative thinking.\nStory artwork cutscenes and presentation are done reasonably.\nOk, the physics may not be realistic....but they are hilarious none the less. There's some simple fun in just throwing a table across the room by running head long into it.\nGood music that works with the themes of the game.\nBindable keys.\nNegatives:\nThe difficulty has been dropped down a bit, and I think it's for the worse. I prefer the challenge of the first, as bullets hit harder.\nWhile the katana is fun to use, it's overpowered. The only real threat when using it comes down to hitting explosive enemies.\nThe engine implementation seems just a little bit off. Like there's a lack of precision at certain points..\nF1 and F2 as default switch buttons? That's silly.\nSome secrets in the game are secrets in name only. They literally are behind a box that you'd usually run into when trying to figure out which way to go, well, it just doesn't work.","June 3","true","12.1"," 27 of 41 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","27","41","0","2"

Read on.\nOkay, if you own Hard Reset, or you own Shadow Warrior, and thus get the crazy 85% discount, ignore everything in the review, go to the "Buy now" button, and pick up the game. At the silly cheap price it's being offered at, they're offering you a gift of a very, very good game, which has been refurnished in their newer engine, with some much needed gameplay tweaks, and some optimisations and additions, for less than the price of a coffee. You would be a complete lunatic not to pick it up for the price offered, or flat broke, but it's -easily- worth the pittance they're asking for the update, and makes the Metro Redux package offer look a bit absurd in comparison.\n\nA cyberpunk shooter of excellent pedigree, now with added polish!\nHard Reset was a -great- game when it came out, it was unashamedly old school, it didn't even have a crouch button. But it's laserlike focus on good gunplay (it had a shotgun that made me happy in ways that should be illegal) and excellent visual design easily marked it as one of my picks back at the time. It's aged well too, mostly because the engine it rested on was a very well optimised one for the PC platform, you could pretty much run it on a toaster and get good looking results.\n\nWhich may beg the question - Why the "redux" update? A few reasons. One - Cybersword. You get a melee option in case you were lacking enough tools as it is. Two, they've integrated the DLC in much more cleanly, so it now presents a much tidier experience. Three, they've updated the engine to give even -more- scalability and at the top end, an even shinier presentation. They've also made some adjustments like deciding the whole stamina system could die in a fire, and therefore allowing you to dodge and run around at will, this is entirely for the good by the way, the game needed that adjustment.\n\nAs before, this is as pure a shooter as it's possible to get, you go charging from place to place shooting everything that isn't you, the graphics are great, the sound is rich, and the enemies are unforgiving. Granted, this isn't DOOM, but it's a very good "AA" tier take on the topic, and it very definitely holds its' own as a game which for half the price, will easily give you a lot of entertainment for your buck.\n\nIn effect, for new buyers this is the "Definitive" presentation of Hard Reset, made ready for the console crowd (and to them I really do recommend they grab it, it's a great experience), and for people on Steam, this is definitely the way to go, because they'll get the version of the game "as the creators intended", a sort of Director's cut if you will. With all the rough edges sanded off and all the best parts made even better.\n\nClosing thoughts\nA good way to look at this is as the "Director's cut" of Hard Reset, it's been given the treatment that the developers felt it deserved, and for current owners, they're getting the finalised version at the cost of a cup of coffee, so there's no reason to feel slighted. For new buyers, this is the version to get, and as a result, I've very little hesitation giving it a solid pair of thumbs up. This is a very, very good "AA" first person shooter, and deserves your time, and your trigger finger.\n\nVerdict : Highly recommended","June 3","true","1.1"," 19 of 30 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","19","30","0","0"

Yeah I think the framerate is a little better but not much.\n\nThis should be called "CONSOLIFIED" rather than "redux".\n\nWith that said, I have missed this game. It is still AMAZINGLY fun and satisfying. This dumbed-down version is still worth the $3 to me. You are essentially playing the 'Shadow Warrior (2013)' character in this game and just because of that I will absolutely play this to completion and do heroic mode again. It's just too fun.\n\nThe original PC-exclusive version is still the best version though, so as a huge fan of this game, I would rather people remember that version when they think of Hard Reset.","June 4","true","9.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

It's confusing and at times overwhelming.\nAlso, to be frank: shooting mostly robots without some sort of twist in these mechanics doesn't equate to a very engaging FPS. They just explode and cause damage to you and rarely react to your fire.\nThe only real positive of this version is that it performs way better than the original.\n\nI'm going to hold out (very) shortly for some sort of statement or patch, but I'm leaning on refunding this.\nI can't really see Hard Reset having fans die hard enough to play a lesser version just for a few 'new' features that don't really end up making the game that different.","June 4","false","1.1"," 22 of 38 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","22","38","0","0"

The goal is to go through the level using 2 flexible weapons that each have modes you can flip them through and unlock even more on the way either by killing enemies, finding orange thingies throughout the levels or finding them in secret areas.\nThe addition of katana makes the combat lot more interesting compared to original games since having a weapon that deals heavy damage in close quarters is invaluable and Shadow Warrior reboot showed us that FWH knows how to make satisfying melee weapon!\n\nThe story is also told by comic-like cutscenes during loading which definitely is something lot more games should do as it makes it less boring. It's not some deep story or anything, but who cares as long you get to shoot stuff.\n\nIn a way this game is now little bit similar to the Shadow Warrior reboot due the changes I listed so if you liked it you might like this game, but be aware that this game's weapon system can be pain to remember right if you're used to classic "each weapon is separate thing".","June 3","true","5.5"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","59","17","29","0","0"

The dash mechanic makes enemies a lot less frustrating to deal with, and there's a lot less attrition issues where you're just shooting the same thing over and over and pausing to run away, then turning back to shoot it and pausing and running and rinsing and repeating. I'd say that maybe they did make it a little easier than the original? But I dunno.\n\nAnyways, it's a fast-paced FPS with lots of fun fights and a bunch of weapon upgrades that you get to select for yourself. Sometimes, in the early game especially, this means you can uh, get the wrong weapons and find yourself a little worse for wear, but after the initial hump of the game, you get into your rhythm. The writing is cheesy and the story is hard to follow, but it feels like an accessory anyways, and it's still a rather explosive and satisfying experience.

Not to upgrade or make better. I agree that it should look closer to the original but this is what it is. We (including myself) have to have a better understanding of what we're looking at or for. With this new generation of games we hear redux and automatically think upgrade of every aspect. Sorry that's not the case.\n\nMy mind state now is, if developers "redux" a game it doesn't mean the game WON'T have new features and updated graphics. It doesn't mean the game WILL have new features and updated graphics. It just means, to be brought back.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmotherfucker/recommended/407810/","drmotherfucker","DrMotherfucker","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmotherfucker/","236 products in account","Preface: I "recommend" this game, but only because there's no in-between choice.\n\nThe big additions are readjusted enemy spawns and damage, infinite sprinting, quick dashes, and a katana.\n\nThe new enemy spawns and stats are much easier than before. Enemies as a whole hit softer and have less health, and some of the encounters have less going on (though there are a lot more flying enemies than before). Insane mode in Redux is probably the same difficulty as Hard in the original, or maybe even easier if you're judicious with the sprinting and dashes.\n\nMuch of the difficulty in the original game was through how limited the player's movement is, making it easy to get boxed in by swarms of enemies or constantly pegged by projectiles. It was a methodical shooter that rewarded planning over reflexes. Redux's infinite sprint and new dashes a la Shadow Warrior makes that almost completely moot. It's totally possible to dash circles around enemies and dodge just about everything, making combat feel much faster and reflexive (especially with the katana), but also undeniably easier.\n\nThe katana is introduced about three or four levels in, and it's pretty much a simplified version of Shadow Warrior's -- left click to swing, right click to hold for a harder swing. Redux's dismemberment system is less visceral than SW's, and the fact that sword is so basic and has no upgrades like the guns means that there's no need to ever use it, so it's really just a novelty. I still enjoyed softening up crowds of enemies and then jumping in to slice them to pieces, but it's still probably more efficient to just gun them down.\n\nSomeone described Redux as "Hard Reset with a Shadow Warrior mod," and that's a pretty good summary. I would probably recommend Redux only to people who really liked Shadow Warrior or couldn't get into the original Hard Reset. I enjoyed it a lot, but I also loved SW and considered HR to be just good. If you are someone who sincerely thinks HR was a great game, Redux will probably be a letdown.\n\nIf this would be your first go-around with Hard Reset, however, I'd recommend you give the original version a shot first. If you end up getting too frustrated with it, then give Redux a go -- it might be right up your alley. On the other hand, if the original HR clicks with you, then only look at Redux if you're interested to see what a faster, easier version feels like.","June 6","true","11.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxfav/recommended/407810/","foxfav","Fox Fav","http://steamcommunity.com/id/foxfav/","558 products in account","I'd say the game is so-so overall. I disliked the original when it came out but I loved Shadow Warrior, so I decided to give this a chance.\nFor me the game plays much better than the original. I love the new dash mechanic and the enemy encounters feel more balanced and less frustrating. More flying enemies makes fights more interesting, although I've yet to fight air and ground enemies at the same time. I definately recommend cranking the difficulty as Normal makes the enemies dish out little damage.\n\nAs far as the graphics go, whether they look better or not is subjective. My issue with the original was that the effects and bloom and what-not obstructed my view and made enemies hard to see. I do not have this problem with the Redux, so they are improved as far as I'm concerned.\n\nUnfortunately many of my issues with the original are present, as well as issues I had with Shadow Warrior. The weapons lack punch and aren't exciting to use, but that's not my biggest issue with the weapons. So many weapons are redundant. For example the Blaster has better range and spread over the shotgun, and seems to do more damage up close. I feel like the NRG and bullet gun could have been combined and overlapping weapons could have been cut. As far as the sword goes, I use it way too much! It's fun, but after the second half of the game the enemies deal too much melee damage for it to be effective, but it's fun if silly. Oddly enough the bulkier enemies can be shredded with the sword if you time your dashes.\n\nIn the last game I found the levels lacking. They can be hit or miss. For the most part I find them too flat with less height variation than Doom, just like in Shadow Warrior. Unlike Shadow Warrior, I found the levels way to samey and I was occasionally lost dispite the smaller and more linear levels. Many levels have sections and rooms that repeat. There's few markers to indicate progress and variation. Even dead bodies blend in with the junk. Level flow isn't great either. The open arena like sections can be interesting with all the envirormental hazards, especially with the enemies more fragile this time around. It's just ashame that the weapons couldn't be more exciting.\n\nIt's old school, but the game is more than generous with health and ammo packs. So no starvation AND no health regen is a huge relief. There's a regenating shield a la Halo, but whatever. I would have liked more old school features like automap, but I only got lost a few times.\n\nI only recommend this game because with all the garbage single player FPSs out there, this one is well above the rest. I say it's good and not great because the game feels like a grind in the third act. Things slow down after the first boss battle, but it's still good enough so far to see it through the end. If you missed the game the first time around, give it a go if your looking for a solid single player FPS.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DGFisawesome/recommended/407810/","DGFisawesome","FDb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DGFisawesome/","722 products in account","The new dash feature (straight from Shadow Warrior 2013) is much apperciated and is by far the one feature that the original game needed the most, but the fact that stamina now seems to be infinite means you can mindlessly abuse it and avoid everything at almost all times, changing the game to be far too easy for anyone wanting a challenge.\n\nI have no clue why they made this change since both Shadow Warrior 2013 and the original Hard Reset (which had no dashing, but sprinting) had limited stamina in order to successfully force careful play. Maybe infinite dashing for Redux was an accident? Hopefully they'll fix it.\n\n\nOtherwise (for now:) Only recommended if you never owned Hard Reset to begin with, or you don't particularly care about challenge in games.\n\nEDIT: The only challenging mode is Insane mode. If you're highly competent at shooting games, you'll at least die a few times on that difficulty.\nI'm going to keep this review up for now because I still think infinite dashing needs to be patched. Hard mode really should not have been so easy before I finally restarted on the highest difficulty.","June 4","false","6.0"," 18 of 35 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","18","35","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/407810/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","212 products in account","War of the machines.\n\nFirst person shooters are starting to come back en vogue. With the recent successful reboot of Doom and Blizzard stepping into the arena with Overwatch, the genre is seeing some of its best action in years. Hard Reset was a game that came and went without a lot of people noticing, but it is also the game that put developer Flying Wild Hog on the map, and eventually led them to create the excellent Shadow Warrior reboot. Now the game is getting a second chance on consoles with Redux bringing a new visual coat of paint, rebalanced action, and even some new enemies and weapons.\n\nHard Reset is a student of the old-school design of shooters. The action is fast, there is no reload button, and the best strategy is going to be circle-strafing. This is also a campaign-only shooter, and a short one at that. There are leader boards and a new game plus option, but once the brief campaign is over, I felt little reason to go back for more.\n\nMSRP: $19.99\nPlatforms: XB1, PS4, PC\nPrice I’d Pay: $14.99. I got the game for 85% off so I paid $3.00.\n\nThere are only two weapons in the game, each with a dedicated button for switching between. Instead of offering an arsenal Hard Reset instead gives players attachments to their weapons, essentially making them new weapons. This is a neat idea in concept, but in execution it becomes cumbersome fiddling with the weapon wheel to switch between the shotgun and machine gun attachment when dealing with enemies. I ended up finding one that worked for most occasions, and stuck with it.\n\nThe enemy variety is also slim. The Redux version does add some new types, but a large bulk of the game is spent mowing down the same collection of robotic foes. Their AI is also simple, spending the majority of their time simply bum-rushing players, which is of course standard for shooters of this type, but also feels dated. The strategy to take them down never changes, so I guess it is good the campaign is brief, as the repetition sets in quickly.\n\nThe shooting feels good, but the lackluster enemy design doesn’t do it any favors. Also for a console shooter I recommend turning off aim assist. It really got in my way more than it helped. The biggest issue I had with the actual game play is that it was rarely satisfying to take down an enemy. Bullets don’t have a good impact when they hit, and none of the guns or attachments feel fun to shoot. The game quickly devolves into a shooting gallery in the most mundane way.\n\nThe story of Hard Reset is told during loading screens with comic book panels dubbed over. Nothing about the story is memorable; the characters are boring, and even the game recognizes players would rather be shooting. When loading is complete, a large swath of text blankets the screen suggesting the proper action: skipping the cut scene.\n\nAt least the world itself is pretty to look at. It is a futuristic, neon-lit environment where it always seems to be dark and raining. Visually the game looks great and runs at a solid frame rate on consoles. It is a pretty game, which is easily one of its most impressive features.\n\nI wanted to love Hard Reset Redux, especially after coming off Doom, which had scratched that 90s FPS itch I have almost annually. There just isn’t enough here to satisfy. Gunplay feels weak, enemies are boring to kill, and the world wears out its welcome quickly. Nothing about this game is overly offensive to the senses, but it just never stands out from the pack either.\n\nGreat looking game\nAction is fast-paced\n\nBad\n\nCumbersome weapon system\nBland enemy design\n\n6.5\nDecent\n\nIn the long run paying $20.00 for a redux version of a game that came out years ago is a bit much. I got the game for $3.00 cause I had Flying Hog's reboot of Shadow Warrior. even now with it on sale for $17.99 is still a bit much.  I don't recommend it at full price.","June 4","false","2.0"," 22 of 44 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","22","44","0","1"

These developers should win awards for the amount of effort that went into the initial game and the Redux version.  I know I have only played a small amount iamount of the game but after playing so much of the 1st version then this I know the difference and how much better this is after the 1st 30 minutes of the game.\n\nIf you are wondering I purchased both versions of the game and had no free version or will ever ask for free versions of games.  I will always give my true opinion of what I think of a game and in this case I think every FPS fan should buy this game to see what a true independentcompany can do as aposed to a company like EA that releases the same game year after year.\n","June 3","true","0.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

Getting the original is really only worth it, if you're into very, very tough games. It's one of the most challenging FPS of recent years, while still being fair and very well balanced (except for a few parts of the DLC), in my opinion.\n\nHard Reset Redux, however, kind of breaks this core aspect of the game, by adding quick save (at all times!), Shadow Warrior's movement mechanics and lowering the overall difficulty of the game. While this might open up the game for a broader audience, it does so at the expense of what makes the original Hard Reset really special.\n\nThat being said, Hard Reset Redux still offers very fun and explosive (literally) gameplay and with the more dynamic movement mechanics it's highly enjoyable in its own way. Bottom line, if you're just looking for a really cool singleplayer FPS, get this Redux version; if you want a super tough challenge, buy the original instead. And, of course, play them on at least Hard (I strongly recommend Insane, though), to get the most out of 'em.","June 4","true","4.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I can highly recomment this title to everybody who missed playing the original, because of the improvements like dashing like in Shadow Warrior. It still feels like a good old retro 3d fps, with still very good graphics, you really see that the game was made for pc back then, and the new engine is so well optimized, that it should be easy for many people to play it in 4k/ downsample it from 4k.\n\nYour enemies, btw. are robots, and at sometimes it feels like you have some quake 2 enemies against you, which adds to the retro vibe, in my opinion.\n\nYou have a skill system, where you collect points which add up till you've gained a skill point, which you then can put into your characters armor and physical abilities, or you can modify your weapons.\n\nYou have 2 weapons. That's it. Unless you spend skill points into those, then you can turn those 2 weapons, into 8, divided by a conventional weapon, and an energy weapon, which transform into different weapons like a shotgun, or a rail gun on the energy side, and both weapons have their own ammunition.\n\nDifferent difficulty settings, a mode that is like new game+ and there is a new survival mode.\n\nAnyway, if you are a fan of "realistic" fps games, or you only like to shot humans in the head, or you wheren't born before the year 2000 and you think old school shooters are outdated, then this game is not for you.\n\nBut if you like retro shooters with a modern touch, then this game is for you!","June 3","true","0.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

Very BladeRunner-esque with it's environment, it's very physics driven, with a highly destructable environment that you can use against your enemies.  Runs smooth and flawless on my R9 290X averaging around 200fps once vSync was taken off at Ultra Settings.\n\nProbably my biggest complaint is that it seems far too easy on Normal mode.  In my first couple of levels, I made mistakes that should have cost me a checkpoint reset several times, but I scraped on through with not too much trouble.  Health and ammo was lying EVERYWHERE in the levels, making stocking back up and staying alive almost ridiculously easy.  Some of the bigger enemies take forever to kill, while their hits to you seem mostly meaningless.  Admittedly, I haven't played on hard or anything else, but I feel that Normal shouldn't be a cakewalk.  Some battles seemed easy to predict, and combat almost became wooden at times ... run backwards, keep the mouse button pressed.","June 4","true","8.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Hum i couldn't find anything to say about it , i watch a few of the artstyle but i basicly passed every cutscenes ( between levels ) because i just don't care .\n\nIn the end what i do care about , and this is what this game does RIGHT :\n\n- NO INGAME CUTSCENES THAT TAKE YOUR CONTROL AWAY !\n\n- No ♥♥♥♥ looting system ( press E to take ammunition and stuff ) just pass on it and it's yours .\n\n- No bullets or ammunition starvation ( if you stop firing with a weapon you regen slowly a bit of ammunition , there is still pickups tho )\n\n- Rewarding combat : great feedback on railgun rocket launcher  , anything explosive or with a " shock " effect . Nothing more glorious than to see a filthy robot explode into pieces after it tryed to kill you in an alley corner .\n\n- Great artstyle direction, i absolutely love this scifi setting , cute robots etc .\n\nWell that conclude my first review on Steam , and i've been here for quite a time :s\n\nThis game has his flaws sure , sometimes lvl design feels really linear , sometimes you wish you could fight more types of enemies etc ...\n\nBut i bought my self Shadow Warrior 2013 and got this " Hard Reset Redux " version for sometimes like 3 Euros\n\nAnd i enjoyed it so much that i felt the need to actually write this review :o !\n\nWell take care Steam Kittens and have fun killing Robots !\n\n\n\n","June 4","true","9.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Yes, please.\nClick the video for an entertaining look at the first mission!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4b55jGgpmY\nThis game came out of nowhere for me and, so far, it's pretty awesome.  It's more of an arcade shooter in that you're encouraged to blast everything in sight.  Mainly, the crazy robots wreaking havoc on the city.\n\nSETTING: The cyberpunk setting is beautiful and immersive.  Like I mentioned in the video, it feels like you're in The Fifth Element.\n\nENEMIES: The enemies are menacing killer robots that are very satisfying to blow up.  I haven’t run into the cyborg zombies yet, but I'm sure I won't be disappointed.\n\nWEAPONS:  You start out with 2 different guns.  Each of these guns can be upgraded how you chose, giving you a wide variety of weapons at your disposal.  Then there's the Cyber-Katana for slicing and dicing :)\n\nMy only gripe is that there are times when it seems obvious that you can walk through an opening or crouch under something - but you can't.\n\nOverall, really fun game that doesn't require a lot of brain power.

Even with G-sync enabled anything other than those two settings will cause this.\n\nEven worst was Shadow Warrior from the same developers.

Huge mistake from devs doing the same thing in redux.\n\nwhy we cant have better hitboxes for walls/enemies, and better weapon handling\nor bugfixes, the stun glitch was annoying in the original\n\nnothing has been fixed or improved upon the base game, they just did a "workaround" with dash so no need to fix the game.(Good thing u can switch weapons faster now)\n\nAI was dumbed down, and the new enemy placements gives u less intense fights.(dash+ other changes was already enough to make the game easy this was unnecessary and clearly just a console thing so noobs can play with controller)\n\nthe "gorilla" doesnt move and attack u once u shoot the leg off for example, this part was funny in the original\nthe interaction interface is gone as well, u just need to push a button now u dont have to navigate cursor on screen\n\nThe charm/reason to play HR was the difficulty, mechanics the game offered to overcome over ur enemies: In the redux version this is all gone. Insane difficulty is like playing original HR on easy and without mechanics. I can dash all day stamina is non existant here and i can dodge anything so easy its totally mindless.Game is more boring, it doesnt have the intense fight the original gave you.They didnt balance the game around dash, they did nothing.\nThe original game was a well put together uniq and hard fps on higher difficulties.It wasnt perfrect game, but had logical design. Redux is a bandaid patch for consoles and without putting any tought into balance/gameplay.\n\nI like dash and all nothing wrong with that in any fps game, but they should have done rework and rebalance to the game, since they sell it as a separate and new product.\n\none of the biggest cashgrab out there for PC in 2016 and towards HR community.\n\nAlso REDUX in general means u make the same game in the original vision, but with better graphics/optimization or gameplay changes even, if improves the game and stays true the original vision.\nHR redux doesnt represent the original vision of gameplay nor enchants/improves it.\nLook at Metro 2033 redux.Thats what i call redux.\n\nMaking the game easier is 1 thing...but making it simple generic console fps as well is stupid.\nThere is no tactical decision, i dont even need to position myself correctly.\nBoth things are important in the original HR, the free infinite dash in redux is just lol and doesnt fit to the core gameplay.Redux removed the depth of the game.\nOriginal game isnt perfect, needed some tweaks and rework, but not this...\n\nalso for 20 euro u can buy real AAA console game like Wolf: the old blood","June 3","false","1.7"," 62 of 138 people (45%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","45","62","138","7","20"

I'll just talk about what I played.\n\nHard Reset Redux is a single-player FPS game where many of its inspirations coming from the old-school FPS games (atleast imo :P)\n\nMany secrets to be found and personally a lot of replay value with the higher difficulties (I've played it twice so far on Normal and Hard, now playing on Insane) and will hopefully move onto a secrets run and then heroic mode.\n\nSome cons however are mainly based on some of the mechanics. For instance, the quick-dash is a great feature which when playing makes my mind boggled that people played without the dash. The issue is that you can use it with no barrier or energy meter. This means you can use it as often as you like and this sort of takes the skill away a bit. Also, although it has some uses, the katana in a lot of scenarios in the later stages of the game really serves no purpose as you'll just take more damage trying to use it.\n\nThese are minor complaints though; I recommend this game because guns = bang bang!","June 6","true","11.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There is a certain amount of thinking involved, but it somehow feels more like the primative lizard brain is in charge than the higher function.\n\nWith the dashing and (presumably the katana, I haven't got that far yet) it feels a lot like Shadow Warrior though, so if you haven't got that yet, pick it up first. It's the better game and it even has an engaging plot, if you're hear for that. I got this on the ridiculously cheap promo sale though, so I'm happy with my purchase.","June 5","true","1.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So the original, but better, and for $3 if you own the original or Shadow Warrior. It's a pretty hard deal to pass up because it's a fantastic game and this is the best version of it.\n\nI'll mention that in terms of graphics, it looks about the same. There's a bunch of people crying about the graphics getting downgraded but it's not something you'll really notice without staring closely at comparison screenshots all day, and especially during gameplay I didn't really notice a difference. Supposedly it's a glitch, but either way I don't see it as a big deal.","June 5","true","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
