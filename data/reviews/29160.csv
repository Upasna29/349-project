It played like a mushroom trip, and made about as much sense as one. I feel that style conquered coherence in this game, and am confused by it's win of Best Indie Game.\n\nI wont go into much detail, but let it be said that there is no proper story. The game relies on "random" quirkiness to evoke some kind of humour, I guess. Like, spawning a block of cheese in a forrest and calling it "ironic".\n\nI'm not saying it's a bad game, I'm saying I didn't get it.

The single piece of music the game repeats during that time goes from pleasant to annoying very quickly.\n\nAs the name suggests, you begin in a garden and your goal is to find large objects in the open environment, stand near them so they are teleported back to the starting area, then repeat this process until you have stacked a tower tall enough that you can reach the moon.\n\nYou can jump, soar and eat various fruits that cause you to fly higher, breathe underwater, shift the earth etc. You will need these to reach restricted areas. Finishing the game will allow you to see some concept art and the developer's bedroom and various other personal photos.

Melding dancehall with bubblegum pop, heartbroken love songs with hilariously catty weirdness, and euphorically catchy melodies with propulsive rhythms this time, instead of painstakingly humanizing the locations, historical inhabitants, and trivia of a certain slab of America, it's more concerned with its own state of mind. Playing off contemporary pop's age-old diva-as-robot trope and cautioning that fellow droids who "burn out" are "ready for demolition," blueberry garden suggests that it's completely possible to be a game and also seek emotional connection. Instead of merely evoking an established style, the levels feel honest and straightforward, so the new wave glances are a vehicle for the design rather than the whole point.

The gameplay is simple and well done, the music is fluid and very classical and keeps the mood there. The puzzle of the game is not hard and will take you not to long to figure out. The ending reveals more to the game and you will have to beat the game to find out what the secret is. The game is well done and very simple. It was enjoyable and is more for those people that like the art form of the game rather then how the game plays.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/wc4/recommended/29160/","wc4","Irish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/wc4/","821 products in account","The blueberry garden follows its 2009 game with an equally strong collection of levels and more refined production ends a great year on a high note. Melding dancehall with bubblegum pop, heartbroken love songs with hilariously catty weirdness, and euphorically catchy melodies with propulsive rhythms this time, instead of painstakingly humanizing the locations, historical inhabitants, and trivia of a certain slab of America, it's more concerned with its own state of mind. Playing off contemporary pop's age-old diva-as-robot trope and cautioning that fellow droids who "burn out" are "ready for demolition," blueberry garden suggests that it's completely possible to be a game and also seek emotional connection. Instead of merely evoking an established style, the levels feel honest and straightforward, so the new wave glances are a vehicle for the design rather than the whole point.

And a really helpful review jogged my curiosity further.\nThen I enjoyed the game a lot :)\nAnd I have to say that by this the game is worth it's price after getting into it. Fly, birdman, fly!\n\nI'll give you some spoilers - step 1 will be mere hints, step 3 will be full-fledged explanations.\n\nSpoiler step 1:\n* there is an objective to this game that will become clear if you play it for a longer while. Don't give up too soon ;)\n* at first it seems like a slow-paced exploration-game, but in reality it's a mean game that enforces quick acting to "win"\n* to reach your objective you will have to understand the game-mechanics and world by experimenting and observing\n* don't be mad that there is no savegame. If you play a bit longer, you will know why it's not important to have one\n\nSpoiler step 2:\n* about the objective: you could say it's to help your birdman to survive\n* why would your birdman need to "survive"? Mind the very first picture being displayed right at the beginning of every new game showing a certain device that is commonly found in any modern household\n* try to make your birdman eat every fruit (Enter), as each type of fruit will provide a certain useful effect for a while\n* there's a separate game-mode called "playground" that can help you to find out more about the game-mechanics that you will need to make use of. Give it a try ;)\n* trees will only produce a small amount of fruit for a while until the trees will die\n* but don't despair, fruit can make new trees grow\n* however fruit will only grow into trees under certain circumstances\n* after understanding these game-mechanics, you can make trees grow to provide you with fruit (and their effects), and if you provide for the right circumstances trees will grow fruit that will grow into trees and grow fruit etc. for a long time\n* at first you might think it's weird or stupid that by touching large objects these will automatically be teleported to your "home" and "litter" it, but this is a very important feature of the game to help you reach your goal/s\n* small creatures do not only eat certain kinds of fruit to make life harder for your birdman, they will sometimes transport fruit to other places, occasionally causing trees to grow there by doing so\n* trees cannot grow / be grown under water!\n\nSpoiler step 3\n(beware and don't read if you want to find out yourself what this game is about)\n\n* a faucet has been left running that will bring disaster to the garden by flooding it\n* the water will start to rise slowly at first, but then faster and faster\n* your birdman will need to turn off the watertap and save the garden. However you will have to find and reach it to do this...\n* or else you can try to reach a safe place that will not be flooded. Maybe the moon?\n\n* by finding large objects and teleporting them home by touching them, you will build a tower that will gradually grow above the rising water-level and in the end will enable your birdman to reach the moon\n* while the tower grows ever higher you will be able to reach higher grounds by flying, starting from the top of the tower\n\n* after lying on dry ground for a while fruits will "decay" and at the spot of their decaying a tree will grow - as long as no other tree is already occupying this spot. Then the tree will produce a number of the type of fruit that the decaying fruit had. After a while (and after having produced a small amount of fruit), the tree will die\n* fruit will automatically drop from their trees if your birdman does not take the fruit, and then will often grow into new trees if the fruit is stopped from rolling before it will drop into water or stop at a spot where no (new) trees can grow\n* make use of these game-mechanics to ensure a constant fruit-supply\n* mind that the rising water will gradually stop new trees from growing in lower areas by flooding them\n\n* the faucet is to the far right and high up\n* eating blueberries will help your birdman to fly higher\n* eating star-shaped fruit will enable your birdman to breath underwater for a while\n* eating brown berries will show you the way to large objects you might want to collect\n* eating onion-shaped fruit will shift a part of the ground sideways where your birdman is standing\n* eating small red fruit will make the part of the ground where your birdman is rise up/grow a bit\n\nSure, a savegame wouldn't hurt ;) However I would rather love to see tons of  "levels" made for this game, each with a new different kind of element bringing surprises ;) More - constant - background-music and different looking characters to choose from would be awesome too. The biggesst mood-killer for me have been the large nonsensical everday-objects drawn in a chidish style (well, and the moose). I'd rather prefer all of these objects to be fantasy-like imaginative fruit or so...","March 4","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
