Dao","http://steamcommunity.com/id/movesiandao/","419 products in account","I still have the boxset from this game in my closet since 2002ish. This game is pure awesome. Don't let its retro looks fool you.\n\n\nIts something along the vibes of jagged alliance. you get character progression and permadeath. Most of the main characters have their own lines and personalities written for throughout the entire campaign; i always tried to keep em alive just for that ;D\n\nother than that, the storyline, while slightly convoluted, simply serves as a backdrop for a great rts/rpg game where you manage not only your resources, but your human resources as well. 4 Character classes where your characters can switch between and gain experience in during missions carry out specific tasks, where soldiers fight, scientists do research and heal people up, engineers start buildings and collect resources, and mechanics drive and build vehicles.\n\nDecisions you make within each mission affect subsequent missions. Somewhere down the line you will be forced to make one which will split your campagin progress into two trees. *spoiler :D*\n\nI really loved the vehicle design in this game, where you slowly overtime research and unlock modules to provide more options for modular vehicle construction. Gun+Chassis+Power source+ wheels/tracks is awesome. I like the really distinctive look of the double gun cars. <3\n\n\nall in all, this game is worth my 20 bucks then, and the 5 bucks now. buy it. you wont be disappointed.","January 27, 2014","true","7.1"," 209 of 224 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","209","224","0","6"

I was wrong - this game is nothing like Achron, and that is not necessarily a bad thing.\n\nLast night, I stayed up until 6 AM trying to beat the first two USA missions in a way I could be proud of, and spent more than an hour on the third mission besides! I've only played one other RTS which directly applies how well I performed on one level to how well I start on the next level and to the degree that it is possible to get an unworkable start if you really mess up. The best part is? The game doesn't tell me that. It lets me explore, lets me find that out. It lets me find out that level 2 is much easier if I keep level 1's wounded soldier alive, lets me discover that Sabre-tooth tigers attack my troops as a matter of course (New policy: Pre-emptive extermination), makes me find out the little things that divide a Lieutenant from a quartermaster.\n\nThe tutorial's unobtrusive, taking the form of hints which pop up along a small, out of the way bar at the bottom of the screen. Easy to ignore if you've seen it before, and easy to miss if you aren't paying attention. Just the way I like it.\n\nThe graphics are, to be honest, not good by today's standards. But I am a firm believer in "Graphics matter only to the point where they help the consumer suspend disbelief", and they are good enough for me to suspend disbelief. If you've played the original Starcraft, it's around that level of quality.\n\nUnlike in Starcraft, however, terrain is hugely important in Original War. Long grass conceals soldiers who are crawling, but is temporarily flattened if a vehicle or walking human crosses it. Harder and softer terrains have different effects on the movement of vehicles depending on their propulsion (Tracks seem to be slower than wheels on harder ground and faster on softer ground) and the movement of infantry.\n\nThe variety of units we have access to is honestly extremely well done - a basic human can fulfill any infantry role, but the skills they've acquired (In four areas, which transfer from mission to mission as the character does) determine how effective they are. Whether they're effective or not, just performing in the role will increase their ability in it. The four roles I've been exposed to - Soldier, Engineer, Mechanic, Scientist - are each so useful choosing between them is actively painful, and I count that in the game's favor. I've only seen three vehicles so far - two wheeled and one tracked - but being exposed to the vehicle construction menu informs me that eventually I will have the option to deploy vehicles of multiple chassis types, controlled directly by humans or remote guided, armed with distinct weapons, and so far I've seen both gasoline and solar power represented in the game.\n\nNow, the gameplay itself. Original War features RTS gameplay, but it honestly spends most of its time telling a story of people trapped two million years ago which is reflected by the gameplay. Most RTS games accept one basic conceit - that if you click a button in the barracks, you get another man or woman with a rifle. Original War rejects that conceit, and as a result you get a game more about using up, salvaging, resource allocation, and making do than it is about build orders, micro timing, or army composition. The result neatly becomes a sort of hybrid between an RTS and an RPG, with the large battlefields and unit management of an RTS and the detailed statistics and many, many options of an RPG.\n\nIn terms of what I as a player can do, Original War impresses me. Do I want the resources that captured vehicle represents more than I want the vehicle itself? I can have it taken apart for a bit of a refund. Do I think it's time for my top soldier to learn how to repair vehicles? I can make her put on overalls and carry repair tools. Do I need to build a bunch of buildings fast? Turn everybody into engineers! Frustrated at the Engineer's slow speed while carrying resources? Vehicles with cargo bays can gather that for them. Am I considering mounting a final, do-or-die assault? Why am I considering that? I can pick the enemy's irreplacable unit count down with a small group of soldiers if I move carefully. Do I want my vehicle to be built quickly or just eventually? Do I want that tech researched NOW or eventually? And this is not counting the in-mission choices - I've received at least one dialogue choice per mission and this is without mentioning the implied choices.\n\nAll in all, if you like RTS games, if you like RPG games, and most of all if you like HARD, uncompromising games which ask you as a player to think, learn, and make choices I think there is a very good chance you will enjoy this game as I am.\n\nEDIT: Having completed the final mission of the USA campaign (One of them, anyway...) I have more to say.\n\nIn terms of Original War's ethics, I am impressed again. Original War is from the 2000s and it would have been easy for the game to fall into the standard American action hero characterization for the protagonists in the fashion that ruined so many other innovative RTS' for me, yet it doesn't. This is most notable in the portrayal of Joan Fergusson, a scientist who was never meant to go back in time but did anyway. In the majority of video games she would be doubly hampered as both a civilian and the love interest of the USA campaign's main character which would result in Fergusson simply being a useless character in both a statistical sense and a storyline sense. Instead, the exploits of this individual are believable given who she is, where & when she is, and what her limitations are. Specifically, if you keep Joan alive she holds bases on two occasions and brings a squadron of AI tank reinforcements to the final battle that you know she built by herself. The same can be said for nearly every other character I have encountered so far (I'm finding it difficult to grasp Major - Comrade Major Platonov - but I haven't completed the Russian campaign so...) which I view as support for the theory that Original War is more of a cross between an RTS and an RPG than really either.\n\nI enjoy Original War's dedication to continuity of choice - most choices made in early levels (Yes, losing units is a choice) will come back to haunt you by the final stages of a campaign. For instance, in USA 2 I chose to spare a captured enemy Mechanic. In a later level, that choice directly affected how I went about that mission. Even small choices like rotating the Scientist and Engineer roles so that everybody gains skill points becomes a major tactical factor by the tenth level.\n\nIf I have one major criticism of Original War, it is that some units seem completely pointless. Apeman Engineers are amazing, Apeman Soldiers are...not. Double Gun Vehicles are always useful, Double Laser Vehicles are an utter waste of time and resources. Original War is hardly unique among RTS games in this sense, and I do appreciate having the options even if they are largely pointless. A point that mitigates this criticism in my eyes is the potential for the player to make useless units - for instance, the abomination that is the Morphling Machinegun or the utter incompetence of the Hovercraft...anything. That some units are useless means less when allowing inexperienced players to make stupid mistakes is such a big part of why I like this game.\n\nAll in all, I still really like this game. There's a better than even chance I will buy it for most of my friends since it is on sale, and I will return to 200 Million years before the modern world after my Age of Empires phase has petered out.","June 30, 2014","true","61.5"," 122 of 129 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","122","129","0","2"

It was very quietly developed in the waning days of RTS popularity and developers were first trying to do something a little different. It is the quinessential "Gem" for any fans of the genre. The art style is unique and clever, fantastic music and the concept was innovative. You don't train new men in the traditional sense; you have a finite amount of men, and you can build vehicles part by part (chassis, turret, fuel source) and train local fauna (aka cavemen) to join your cause. Each of your men (and women) have a name, and stats, and a specialty. You can change their roles as a match goes on (sniper, infantry, medic etc...) to suit your needs. In campaign mode, survivors of each battle with gain XP and "lvl up". Having an RTS with RPG elements back in 2001 was something special, but I'm not sure this game is for everyone TODAY. I think if you're a die-hard fan of the RTS genre, this is a great pick! Even if you're a fan of retro PC gaming in general, go for it. If you're looking for a Starcraft killer, move right along.","January 27, 2014","true","1.0"," 131 of 152 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","131","152","0","0"

I personally enjoy the way the game handles base building and unit management a lot.\n\nThe catch with this RTS is that you can't train units. You need 5 soldiers to attack the enemy? You can't train them like that. You start with a certain amount of people and those you have to stick with. You can't just say "5 soldiers plz" and your barracks will poop out 5 people. That doesn't work here.\n\nSome maps/campaign missions have some sort of unit spawn, but in MP it can be selected and in SP it's doesn't make you OP.\nYou can train apes or make Computer or remote controlled vehicles to prevent loss of actual soldiers, which adds a really nice touch to the game and is a nice alternative to regular RTS games.\n\n\n\nI think everyone should give this game a try, it's one of my most favorite RTS games ever and I can only urge you to consider buying it, especially at such a low price.","January 27, 2014","true","2.9"," 188 of 238 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","188","238","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/concordance/recommended/235320/","concordance","emb","http://steamcommunity.com/id/concordance/","232 products in account","One of the most fun and conceptually interesting RTS games I've ever played. It's an Original War in more than name.\n\n\nThe Good Things:\n\n\nGood mix of RTS and RPG mechanics. Humans are a limited resource, they do not respawn and you do not receive more than you start with. Each character can gain experience in 4 classes and can change between classes at any time in the appropriate building, retaining his experience. Some things (construction, vehicles, turrets) can be automated, removing the need for a human pilot, but computer-controlled entities are slower, shabbier and do a lot less damage than those controlled by a skilled human operator. You must always find a balance between risking irrepleaceable human staff and wasting resources on suboptimal AI control.\n\nAs far as vehicles go, you build your own by mixing together a chassis, engine, pilot (can be manual, remote or AI) and weapon. New components are made available by researching them and/or building addons for a vehicle factory, each of which can only accomodate five - and all factions have at least six possible addons that can be mixed and matched. While higher tech components are generally more powerful than lower tech ones, they never render the low tech ones truly obsolete, by virtue of costing more, taking longer to build and being more specialized (e.g. heavier vehicle turrets cannot rotate unlike lighter ones).\n\nThe game is in isometric 2D, but the terrain obeys the rules of 3D in a way no later games did - unit vision works as "rays" instead of a radius, trees and rocks obscure vision, units on high ground see and fire further, soldiers can go prone in tall grass to become virtually invisible, etc.\n\nTerrain layout, elevation, trees have a real impact on gameplay. Infantry uses it as cover and to avoid vehicles, vehicles require a tracked chassis to ascend slopes, and the most powerful vehicle in the game is  balanced by being too huge to climb a hill.\n\nThe two campaigns are long, varied and challenging. If you go for all bonus objectives on the highest difficulty, there's easily at least 60 hours of gameplay (though I clocked 120 due to leaving the game running in the background a lot). The American campaign is the best one, having a good story and characters.\n\nThe Bad Things:\n\nThe sound effects are bland and lack variety. There is only one sound effect for most actions.\n\nThe voice acting in the Russian campaign ranges from mediocre to terrible. This is specific to the English version only - the Polish and Czech versions actually have very good voice acting.\n\nThe Russian campaign feels drawn out and padded at times, and the Russian part of the story feels disjointed.\n\nThere is no campaign for the third faction (Arabs). You get many glimpses of clearly important Arab characters and see echoes of their ventures happening offscreen, but the campaign that was supposed to explore them in detail was never added since the publisher went bankrupt.\n\nThere is no skirmish for the same reason as above.","October 25, 2014","true","139.2"," 54 of 57 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","54","57","0","0"

Let me tell you why this is one of the finest RTS games ever made. A truly exceptional example of the genre but mainly for reasons that set it apart from most strategy games.\n\nLet's talk about what it does that may not be so different but is instead allows us a comforting familiarity with what we've come to expect from Sci-fi RTS games. As is a staple of the RTS Genre the single player comes with two campaigns, a Russian and American/NATO campaign. There is the cliché'd sci-fi super-rare-new-resource, and of course it's a green crystal.\n\nWhat sets Original War apart from most RTS games is... Well, quite a lot actually. For one; it's set in a world where time-travel is possible. Russia and America are vying for control of a new-found substance called Siberite (known as Alaskite in the Russian campaign.) Both superpowers decide to use time travelling machines to go back and move all the  green-glowing-good-stuff to their respective territories, so that when the future comes around they'll already be in possession of every valuable deposit of said resource. For the soldiers embarking on this mission; it means a one way trip. Speaking of soldiers...\n\nThroughout the story you'll be given a single protagonist (American's get Macmillan, Russians get 'Gorky') and if they die, it's game over. The rest are cannon fodder. Likeable cannon-fodder. The problem with liking these human meat shields is if these characters die, that's it. They don't come back. Given that each character has stats based on what you had them do most (building vehicles, constructing fortifications, shooting enemies, or researching space-time anomalies) they get better at it through an EXP system. Even if you don't find yourself liking their dialogue (impossible), you sure as hell will miss their efficiency. Certain characters dying affects the story too, sometimes in a grim way (this is true of both campaigns).\n\nThis is but a brief overview of the game, there's a lot more off-the-wall design elements you should experience for yourself and for it's price, Original War will not disappoint. It's difficult to find anything to dislike; The RPG elements are unobtrusive, the cheesy dialogue is heart warming and with memorable characters such as Colonel Powell and Lisa Lawson (to name but a few) I cannot reccomend it enough.","August 28, 2014","true","15.0"," 56 of 62 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","56","62","0","4"

You cannot create different soldiers, you can only use the ones you've got (and some you can find scattered throughout certain maps)  This means you have to treat each life as vital.\n\nYou change jobs at different buildings, choosing from soldier, engineer, mechanic, scientist.  Each jobs allows the unit to perform different tasks.  Scientists heal and research upgrades and can spot and mark oil.  Engineers pick up the shipments of crates that are sent back from the future and build buildings.  Mechanics can work in the workshop (or whatever the vehicle and turret gun creating building is called) to create vehicles, guns for turrets and they also repair and drive vehicles (each class can drive vehicles and perform based on their mechanic skill.)\n\nAll this adds up to quite an enjoyable game.  It also includes a pause feature that allows one to stop the action and give complex sets of orders which is certainly noteworthy and unique in thie genre.\n\nI caught it on sale for a buck and it's not too expenisve otherwise.

OW is (even thought it´s age) original not just in the means of timetravel and war in the far past and for the past. Above all it´s brilliant combination of rts and rpg, what makes it so unique. In terms of gameplay it means you have to care about every soldier you have (and in this harsh environment, it´s usually much less than optimal numbuer). You have to always think abut for what to use each soul and how to treat it. What skills to train, where to allocate the manpower, what technology develop and when. Becouse even won battle for valuable resource, if it took too much time, can endanger development of your base and therefore whole mission. Loosing any soldier means hell of a trouble. There are usually multiple ways how to achieve your goals, but every one need careful tactical thinking from base management to field battle strategy.\n\nThis way it may sound like hardcore stuff for very patient tacticians... but it´s not. Above all, it´s very enjoyable game for anybody. The main experience isn´t frustration, but fun. Lots of fun. There are some things that help this outcome. First is excellent level design. Missions arent repetitive, but almost always bring some new challenge. They vary from more traditional base-to-base war to Commandos-like stealth action. Often there are also twists in the developement of events, which boosts gameplay with dynamics and pushes you to be prepared for anything.\n\nThe last but not least quality is the main story. From the "cliché" of American-Russian war (just situated in unorthodox setting), situation quickly extends to be more complicated. Player is therefore forced to choose which side (and which politcs, ethics and philosophy) to pledge allegience to. Not just from global perspective, but from personal view of main hero and his relationships, too. Which even adds emotinal touch to game. Quite special for rts, isn´t it? Oh, I forgot to mention that (living) soldiers and their valuable experience goes to next missions. And that for some of the more important characters amongst them, you will soon develop special feeling.\n\nGame has, of course, it´s weaknesses (like poor voicecast), but there are not many of them. Somebody may despise the old graphics, but I like it even after all those years.\n\nSo in the end I have only one advice regarding Original War: Enjoy It!!!","April 1, 2015","true","63.0"," 30 of 32 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","30","32","0","0"

I must have spent a good 50+ hours playing the demo alone before I finally managed to get my hands on a copy of the full game.\n\nI still to this day bring Original War up regularly in my gaming rants about how unique and inventive it was, and how disappointed I am that it didn't get the attention it deserved. I'm glad to see it on Steam now and it's fun to see how pretty much everyone else that's played it feels the same way as I do.\n\nBesides compatibility issues this game has aged extremely well. I still play it from time to time over 900+ other newer games I could be playing.

When they die they're gone for the rest of the campaign (unless you restart, which will become a habit if you're anything like me and can't let a single person die ever) which makes you actually care about who you send out and think more carefully about the most optimal ways to get all your soldiers out of each mission alive. A lot of official reviewers back in the day complained about the voice acting but personally I love it. Sure it's not super serious and amazing but I find that it adds more charm to the game, makes me laugh and makes the experience generally more memorable. I frequently find myself doing impressions of the more 'unique' characters like "Oleg Kazimirowicz Gleb" (you'll understand when you run into him) and lip syncing all the story dialogue when I go back and repeat playthroughs.\n\nYou have to assign characters to research new technologies for weapon, building and vehicle production as well as go out into the world and collect enough resources to sustain that production. In singleplayer it's all tied into the story very well. There are also dialogue options and decisions you'll get to make that strongly impact the outcome of your game and who will survive.\n\nAs far as I'm aware, the online community is still very much alive for the game however it still seems to be mostly Czech and Polish folks playing (as those two countries were basically the only places where the game was decently advertised). It's because of this that the first words ever I learned in another language besides English were polish, back in the GameSpy arcade days. They were swear words (go figure).\n\nThere's also a website called 'owsupport' that actively releases patches/fixes for the game and as their name suggests, provide support for the OWar community so if you ever need help that's the place to go.\n\nOverall it was an underrated, poorly advertised game that deserved a lot more credit for it's ingenuity than it received and I highly recommend buying a copy and giving it a go.","August 22, 2014","true","40.4"," 28 of 32 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","28","32","0","0"

Great animation sequences (both the Hand Drawn for the americans and 01's for Russians) I felt like I was there the whole time, replayed every mission several times, tried to take every medal without save in master strategist difficulty and unlocked all futures! This is a game where every choice you make counts! Full of great ideas and innovation! I played this game back in 2002 and I was really amazed by it! Now that I found that it is supported by steam it was an instabuy! Why this game is one of the best:\nIt is an rts with rpg elements! Different voice,face,background story for every troop you have! if you shoot with someone his soldier skills will improve, if you heal with someone his scientific skills will improve, if anyone dies, he dies forever!\nYou can make choices in the game that affect the future!\nThe american and the russian campaigns focus in the same story from two different sides, you have the choice to either stay loyal to your superiors in rank, defy them and take leadership or abandon the army focused factions and join the alliance of american and russian scientists! Each campaign has it's own feeling and both are amazing! In the american campaign you will search for siberite and blue will be your favourite color! In the russian campaign you will search for alaskite and red will be your favourite color!\nIn the Russian campaign you can build your own base from the scratch! Make the bulldozers clean the field from the rocks and trees and then start building your base! It will take you some time to built it but the buildings you made will stay in the same place you built them through out the campaign and you will feel like you are having an impact with the game! And after your Nemesis MacMillan burns your base down you will feel furious to see your creation destroyed! You will have choices like who will you appoint commander of the base when you leave, should you interrogate/kill/release a prisoner and should you go out of your way to help your friends or not?\nYou will also develop Bombs of mass destruction, train apemen to gather resources or make them soldiers or teach them to drive tanks or explode on enemies! or train them to be suicide apemen that drive tanks full of explosives! control tanks with remote towers or AI, hack enemy AI tanks, research alien artifacts with unique properties, become major, take the russian communist quiz to prove yourself an ally of the cause, kill endangered species millions of years before they become endangered, become invisible or shoot time alternation bazookas!\n\nIf you like hamburgers,time travel and/or mother russia, you will like this game.","November 22, 2014","true","95.4"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","15","19","0","0"

Every single one has unique personality and once they're dead, they cannot return. There are resources randomly spawning across the map and sometimes you have to fight for every supply you need.\n\nThere are two official campaigns where you play as Americans or Russians. You'll also face mercenaries led by Arabs who were also meant to have a campaign but unfortunately it was cancelled (there is a fan made campaign "The Arabian Campaign" which perfectly fills the hole though).\n\nYour units can change their job during a mission. They can become a soldier, engineer, mechanic or a scientist. They keep getting better and better at their job and it's up to you to make them even better. You also assemble vehicles and turrets which can be controlled by your soldiers or just make them fully automatic.\n\nAlso I live in Czech Republic, the country where this game was developed and the Czech voice acting is just perfect.

The game was after it’s release (incorrectly) compared with Red Alert 2, but OW is pretty different game. There you have limited characters and every of them has own identity and skills that you can improve during missions. Often you can choose your favourite characters for your team the mission starts. If there dies any of your person, you will not be able to “reborn” him or her again. So, it’s not a strategy where you can buy hordes of soldiers and then you would crush the enemy by massive force. There you need to find the way how to defeat often stronger or better stationed enemy.\n\n+ very original game (original war should be original =)) and interesting story\n+ nice graphic (at least for year 2001)\n+ campaigns are long and nonlinear (player has to make many decisions that can influence the story and the end as well)\n+ three playable sides (Americans, Russians and later Aliance) and one additional (Arabians)\n+ every side has special weapons and professions\n+ nice cutscenes\n+ many and sometimes funny dialogs\n+ every character can improve skills and change professions (soldier, builder, mechanic, scientist and others)\n+ many characters have own charisma and special features (you will like them =))\n+ prehistoric animals\n+ some animals you can use and train\n+ includes multiplayer (you can play there for Americans, Russians and Arabians too)\n\n- no campaign for Arabians (although you can hire several times Arabians)\n- no skirmish mode\n\nThis game I already played maybe 100 times during last 12 years, so I think I can say this is an excellent game. I can definitely recommend this game as I have never met any person who said "I didn’t like it". I have to give 10 points from 10.","March 13, 2015","true","84.2"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

Sure, playing with players is more fun and how its meant to be played, but a little practice would be nice so you have a feeling of the difference in pace from the campaign missions.\n\nAnd as for the good:\n- Open ended story/campaign, the campaigns in this game have so much dialog, possible results and effects with decisions, I have fun messing with the game still after all these years just repeating missions to find all the dialog and effects on a mission, you can branch them out on each playthrough and it will save them going from worst to best result, plenty of replayability if you have the patience. remember, the results of one mission can easily effect another, be it good or bad, the mission after, or a mission much later in the game.\n- Characters/RPG elements, This game doesnt allow you to spawn more troops, besides from vehicles and buildings, the people what you have is what you get, if someone dies, your not seeing them again. this makes you want to keep each one alive for multiple reasons outside of keeping the base running, characters are far more efficient at most if not all tasks depending on their class, each class can be leveled up granting them slight stat boosts in defense/attack while being more efficient at the role they are in. This causes tension when a battle starts, should you send remote or AI forces at the enemy? having mediocre stats but can be rebuilt, or should you send your valuable characters with better stats, but irreplaceable on death. The stats of a character are important even when building a base, the higher level engineer you have not only chages how fast a building can be made, but also the quality of its defense increases too, two of the same built at different leveled enigineers, the higher level building will have higher natural defense.\n- Easy to Control/Responsive, In an RTS being able to command your forces and view the map is critical, while Original War does have hotkeys, you don't need to use them to be effective, you can play this game pretty decently with just the arrow keys, mouse and shift key, sure you might not be as fast as the pros and in multiplayer the experienced likely know how to group everything well with presses, But its nothing to worry about, in my opinion an RTS needs functionality in its hud and controls or it breaks apart. This has it and is easy to use.\n- Speed up/Slow down bar, to counter the bad of the game being slow paced or being fed up of just watching your men do a slow walk from point A to point B and repeat, or even just the time it takes to do a certain building, research or vehicle you can speed the entire game up which saves time, you can also slow down the game speed too which is useful for doing those hard decisions in which unit to attack or even just to time the retreat just right for maximum damage to the enemy and minimal damage to your own forces.\n\nThe first two good things though are what really seal it though, its one of those things you have to see for yourself so you can understand, its very gripping, provided you don't mind doing a few reloads as you learn from mistakes. I guarantee it will happen.\n\nFor the things in middle.\n\n- Soundtrack suits the factions and moments, but sadly they are short and repeat often, I don't mind it but I'm sure some may get annoyed with its frequent looping. I'd say its best music is the Main Menu music.\n- While I said the voice acting isnt exactly the best, I do find it amusing in moments, its the type of bad that can make you laugh at times depending on your sense of humour.\n- Similar to the soundtrack, sounds effects are also repeated over and over, its always the exact same gun fire sound and explosion for everything, again, this can be annoying if you want variety or don't like things being heard over and over, but to me anyway, they are decent enough to keep you satisfied, you know what the intention for each sound is and it works.\n- American campaign cutscenes are nicely drawn in front of you as the protaganist talks to you, I think its a nice effect, the Russian ones are done much differently, while I like them too for the sake of them looking and feeling different for obvious reasons, the American ones are in my opinion better to observe just for the artistic touch.\n- In game cutscenes are included too, but while I get some are nesscesary at times for moments in the game and to know what's happening, some of them are utterly pointless and waste your time doing something unnesscary, example, your given orders and told what to do, but instead of game just loading the next part, it decides to wait as you have to sit there and watch characters move out the map which you cant control or influence, and being the slow paced game it is, at times it can take awhile, nothing too big mind you, but it can be an irritancy to me.\n\nWell I think I've ranted enough, but overall this is a really fun game and I do recommend picking it up and giving it a try at least, I believe it needs more respect than what it got, suire its my inner nostalgic child demanding that but seriously, the title is right, its certainly 'Original' in how it plays.","October 3, 2014","true","103.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

I found it again some time ago and fortunately it was available on Steam, so I bought it and started playing.\n\nIt was even better than I remembered. This game is really underrated and offers a great RTS experience. At the time of its release it was really ahead of its time. I really like that the vehicles and buildings can be upgraded with different modules and configured as you see fit. I haven't tried the multiplayer yet, but I believe that the customizability will really add another dimension to the strategy.\n\nThe single player missions are very nice. Sometimes the full out heads on assault just won't cut it and you have to use your smarts to overcome the situation at hand. Very challenging at times.\n\nOverall I suggest you try this game, should you like the RTS'.","August 19, 2014","true","20.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The limiting factor of your primary resources (building material and people themselves) which contrasts with the ability to recycle and train "natives" (apemen)/build AI war machines and all this combined with usually limited space of your base which you have to upgrade in certain way presents a very interesting decision-making tactical situation. Add a very interesting and thought-out storyline with different timelines as a result of the time travel and you have a great unorthodox game.\nYou will want to know what happens next, you will want to know how your decision affects the outcome and you will want to branch out in the campaign to know what would have happened if you made a different decision. The game also offers tactical options, such as units with greater range then they can see, visibility obstructing terrain, including trees, higher ground granting firing range bonus. The soundtrack is also good and nicely themed - the sort of "lumberjack style" for US and the typical tunes "Siberia style" (as we nicknamed them with friends) for Soviets. Speaking of soviets, you will look forward for any communication with your superiors or cutscenes - all great jabs at the party propaganda and way of thinking.\nA great older game, RTS where a second here or there is not important, you actually want to carefully plan and execute.\n\nMessage for Czech players about dubbing: Hra je i v češtině, ale jen titulky. Dabing je celý v Angličtině, takže pokud jste OWar dříve hráli a těšili se na parádní české nadabování, bohužel.","January 2","true","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's a must have! The multiplayer might still be a bit wonky, it's playeable thanks to Stucuk's (OWSupport) patches that are being gradually released on steam too. The story is just amazing. As you play through the campaing you get overflown by feels. Sometimes you have to do really hard decisions that affect the end result... very often even turn the tide of a battle. The characters are really well written for an RTS game of it's age. The graphics are good even for today's standards. Though the English voice acting compared to the Czech seems a bit poor. (Maybe it's because I grew to like the game with the Czech dub.) I noticed that the Czech voice actors put a lot more soul into it and the characters felt more "alive".\n\nAll summed up. Get this game. It's worth it. It's brilliant.","July 16, 2014","true","22.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

During WWII America finds an alien artifact. after years of research and naming it EON they find crystals in Siberia of a similar nature to EON and look into both. they soon discover EON is a device that can send anything placed within, back in time, using the crystals now named Siberite. most of the Siberite is in Russian turf though so to solve this they send soldiers back in time 2 billion years in the past to transfer the Siberite over to Alaska. when they get there they find resistance however. The Russians are ready and waiting from them.\n\nDownsides:\nThe sounds can get a little aggravating if you're not used to them. basically get used to hearing "FINE SIR!" or "OKAY SIR!" every time you move a unit, in a high pitched voice most of the time.  ocasionally there's a bit of bad voice acting too albeit most is pretty good. there are a few missions in the game where if you do not know what you're doing or haven't done the mission 50 bazzilion times before like i have it can be VERY difficult even on easy mode. The only ones really to note though are the ones where you join the Alliance so if you're not planning to its not a bother. Unfortionatley due to the game being fairly obscure most of the multiplayer is empty unless you can get a friend to tag along with you. the final downside is that the game Lacks a skirmish mode or an offline non-story mode. it would of benefitted greatly from it due to it being so hard to find a multiplayer opponent.\n\nBrief background summary:\nOriginal war is a game that proves even rushed games on low budget can be good. the company was starting to go bankrupt near the end of the game's completion so it was all they could do to quickly get the game out before they did. As the company that made it is not around to maintain it, the game has become community run and there's even projects to get a third campaign currently underway by people who want to see the game more known. There's alot of modding from the community too if you can find them. some such as a third Arabian campaign albeit short an unfinished and ones that let you do a skirmish mode as the game lacks one itself as i said previously.\n\nConclusion:\nI would highly recommend it because the story is interesting, the gameplay is fun, the soundtrack is pretty good and overall it can be a great experience. If you like old games, obscure games or retro games then I would say you get this game in a heartbreat. for those just looking for a fun RTS I still highly reccomend it but i feel its worth looking at before you get it to see if you like it.\nnot much a fan of giving number based ratings but hey, people like to know so here's mine.\n\nGameplay- 9/10 -pretty fun but can be frustrating if you lose lots of units.\n\nStory- 7/10 -Starts good and pretty interesting but can feel kinda meh in places and can show at times its semi rushed. it doesn't take away from the rest of it though.\n\nSoundtrack- 6/10 I LOVE the soundtrack and music for this game however you will hear it ALOT so i cannot give a full rating of 10 as i would like to.\n\nOverall- 8/10 -Personally i'd like to give 10/10 but i cannot because the flaws it has show fairly visibley. even my huge nostalgia for the game cant deny that. however the flaws dont take much from the game and it is still a great one in my opinion.","April 3, 2015","true","89.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

It introduced (possibly pionieered?) a handful of unique features to the genre, such as: campaign/story branching, RPG elements, visibility mechanics, death system, vehicle design... to name just a couple. All these novelties enchance the gameplay greatly and make the game really stand out even nowadays. Original War came out back in 2001 and some of those features are nowhere to be found in more modern real time strategies. You just can't overesitmate the level of innovation and creativity that's present in this title, even by contemporary standards. The thing I like the most about this game though is it's absolutely amazing, immersive and original (pun intended) setting, based on Wolfgang Jeschke's novel "The Last Day of Creation". Time travel... Americans... Russians... apemen and resource war waged in the past... I'm in!\n\nUnfortunately Original War suffers from rather poor voice overs and lack of AI. The campaign missions are downright scripted and the game does not offer single player skirmishes against computer. Multiplayer is there along with a couple of play modes. I only wish there were more challenges on steam which would add some replayability value.\n\nOriginal War has aged a lot over the years but it's aged with dignity. I'd say it's definitely worth trying out, especially for people who are into old school gaming and especially for this price.\n\nBottom line: this game deserves either a decent remake, sequel or prequel, would love to see it out one day. Or how about a FPS spin-off? Nah, I'm going too far ahead here - the world isn't ready.\n\nEDIT: they added 21 achievements one day after I wrote this review, wow. Looking forward to Original War 2 now, I guess.","May 25, 2014","true","54.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have here 3 Factions and your resource are actually your people.\nYou in online games from 9 to 24 people, if killed they are hard to replace, you cant buy them again.\n\n\n\nYou can let appear new , but even on fastest option it takes time.\nYou change by your characters any time with right building in 5 Classes.\nTrooper, Scientist Mechanic Worker or Special trooper after Update. You can research a lot of Stuff here, and build a lot of interesting Tanks.\nIts a special RTS, in most you do just let people die, here you must look that they survive.\nBy do their job the level up and are this way more efficient, but can be equipped anytime to do other stuff.\n\n\n\nYou collect crates and can train apes to help you, build tanks and people do drive them. You can upgrade your tanks so far that they are controlled by PC, but Tanks with people are more efficient. You can fuel your tanks with oil and must refill them or with a special Crystal, so they don't need to be refilled.\n\n\n\n\nBest is the Story, there are several outcomes of the story and you can anytime look what would have happened if you choose the other stuff. Like what if you do side with rebels or stay by the order.\nYou have really good characters you can either play American or Russia in the Story, in Multiplayer you can play Arab, who do have suicide Apes or their Tanks can explode. In Story each you your Troopers is a character with own voice and story,you do permanent loose a character if he dies, you don't have him in next mission, you can replay anytime the mission so more people survive. Its not like you have just 10 Missions and do them. There are situations like you are asked, stay loyal, rebel or join a new side. You can try out all 3 outcomes. So its more like 100 different ways to finish the game the way you want.\n\nEach human has its own name and portrait, speed, firepower and defense scores, and experience levels.\n\nAmerican and a Soviet campaign are awesome. Missions on both sides tend to contain scripted events, multiple-choice situations and sidequests. Human units persist between missions, so that each loss is a loss for the rest of the game.\nThe Story did really impressed me, not like today here you go just kill or bomb someone.\n\n\nIf you still like 2D RTS games, you have here a solid, well balanced and good game.","August 11, 2015","true","5.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It may even have come to reside in that special place in my heart - you know, on the 3rd shelf, next to C&C. For many others, it clearly still does, as it benefits from a strong, active community.\n\nHowever, having only found this much later in its life during a Steam sale, I was somewhat disappointed. It suffers similarly to the RTS games of the same era from single- or two-trick-pony AI. The script and voice acting with which it is delivered are, frankly, terrible, undermining what feels like would have been a fun, novel setting back in its day. Even as a fan of the old-skool RTS games, I have to, somewhat sadly, say this was more miss than hit for me.\n\nWorth checking out if you are a fan of similar games from that era, but one I'd recommend you catch in a sale.\n\nReviewed after just under 50 hours play.","August 25, 2015","false","49.0"," 13 of 39 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","13","39","0","0"

This does disable any Steam-functionality, so no achievements for those intrested. Story is hardly inspiring, even though it does make a few twists and turns further on. Regardless, it's hardly enticing from the start.\n\nPro's & Cons:\n\n+ Intresting gameplay mechanics (Vechiles running out of fuel are pushed by the driver, etc... intresting eye to detail)\n\n- No tutorials aside from the tooltips that appear AFTER you've constructed the unit/building or met the event. Confusing what units do/can do at first.\n- Cliché storyline: Starts off incredibly bland & far-fetched. Picks up if you can wrestle through it.\n- Pathfinding AI utterly garbage at times\n- Period in which the game is set is hardly used to its full extend (gameplay & story-wise).\n- Sound design: Repetitive voices & bland music hardly inspire.\n\nFinal comments: Cheap, but not worth your time. MANY more games out there that are far better, even in its Russia vs USA strategy gerne.","November 30, 2014","false","0.7"," 5 of 44 people (11%) found this review helpful","11","5","44","0","0"

The graphics and dialogue actually seemed worse than the 80s-90s feel I was looking for. Along with that, the controls were often buggy and unresponsive. There were also extremely few times you could save, so death would often mean going back through almost two hours of playthrough.

But i have fixed it now what you need to do is\n\nopen original war and where it says launch game, mod launcher, read me, website, configuration and quit\n\n\nyou need to enter configuration and 1) Turn off hardware scrolling in game's settings (in the launcher).\n2 do not use extra video memery\n\n3 resolution 800x600\n\n4 windowed\n\nmake sure they are clicked and then hit back and then start the game and that should fix it. Also do not forget to save it just at the end and start of each level as there is no auto save . So if you got a bad feeling that means save the game.\n\nafter completeing the usa mission the game is great but crashes some times you need to un select the 1) Turn off hardware scrolling in game's settings (in the launcher).\n2 do not use extra video memery\n\nand then re select them again or the game will crash at the end of every mision and even on start up if you dont do this.
