Don't get me wrong, potty humor is funny time to time but this doesn't have 'finesse' I guess you could say. I am not convinced they worked that hard on this, and the camera angles are verrrryy misleading..freeze the trailer at 15 seconds (if the trailer is the same as when I wrote this) and that is your gameplay camera angle (static 2.5d with side scrolling people.)

The fact that you could poop on people is the only thing that the game had to offer and they take that away from you the second you start. The game is full of glitches and it's funny for about 5 minutes of the 30 minutes you could possibly play to get all the achievements and delete the game.\n\nThere is 3 stages in the game. In each stage you will start by dropping a few turds here and there and as you progress you will unleash destructive bowel movements upon the unsuspecting population of characters that barely resemble human beings. You have a small variety in these destructive bowel movements such as firework liquid diarrhea and Mexican food landslide crap.\n\nOverall it's just not worth the $1","March 16","false","0.7"," 90 of 111 people (81%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","81","90","111","10","2"

I have beaten it in one hour with all achievements. Which means 1$ for 1hrs of gameplay. That sounds like a fair price to me. There is only one problem...  Flash games are better than this!

To think there are adults just waiting for their chance to denounce other adults because they still find the crude simplicity of poop jokes funny.\n\nAs if deriving any kind of good nature from a bowel movement or a fart is immediate grounds for being stripped of all noble status or perceived brilliance.\n\nAnd yet any well-read person will know that toilet humor appears in the works of Shakespeare; King Lear, Comedy of Errors, Othella, Two Gentleman From Verona are just a few examples. In Aristophanes' THE CLOUDS, a character describes his bowel movements to Socrates as thunder passing through him. Highly celebrated author Jonathon Swift wrote an entire pamphlet on the benefit of flatulence.\n\nThere's even a story in 1001 Arabian Nights Tales of a man who flees his wedding after letting out a long, noticeable fart at the ceremony. If that doesn't strike your ancient fancy, in Dante Alighieri's THE INFERNO, near the end of chapter XXI, we're told of a demon mobilizing his army by using his butt as a trumpet.\n\nSo if you're one of the special little snowflakes who hates this game because it dares to use bodily functions as a comedic template, then my advice is not to have children. Like, ever. Seriously. Don't procreate. You'll hate yourself for having to change diapers and your child will resent you for growing up in a household where they aren't allowed to laugh when somebody farts.","March 31","true","0.9"," 75 of 96 people (78%) found this review helpful 53 people found this review funny","78","75","96","53","6"

And then you keep stirring and you slowly come to the dark realization that it's not actually a bowl of soup at all, it's just a big bowl of poop with little bits of soup stirred in to give you the impression that anything good could come out of this Eldritch nightmare in a bowl. Five days later your body is found, hanging in your closet from your computer's power cable, your family is wondering where it all went wrong, and the only evidence of any sort of foul play is a small bowl of poop on your table.\n\nThat's basically what browsing Steam Greenlight is like these days.","March 22","false","0.2"," 79 of 113 people (70%) found this review helpful 95 people found this review funny","70","79","113","95","1"

Using a limited number of poops, hit as many as you can in a row without missing to build up your multiplier (and, ultimately, your score) and permanently unlock extra bonuses which carry over into all future attempts of that stage. Bonuses include additional poojectiles/attempts, extra pedestrians to aim for, and special moves to maximise the filthy, disgusting carnage and make each go easier than the last.\n\nThis is a globe-trotting poop adventure, as you let rip with your tyrannical turd tirade upon New York, Beijing, and Paris, and terrorise as many local stereotypes as possible. There's a checklist of targets or objectives in each location, too, which also carries over across multiple attempts, aaaaaand............... yeah... That's it. That's the entire game, right there.\n\nThere's only about 40-50 minute's worth of gameplay to complete everything, or Steam Workshop content to stretch it our a little more if you're bothered, but aside from some easy achievements or trading cards for those who actually care about them, there's nothing else here. Controls are OK enough, using WASD to move from side to side and adjust targeting, though the actual hit detection feels kinda wonky and doesn't always seem to land where you're aiming. It's not a huge deal, but it is an issue you'll definitely notice.\n\nIt's dumb as all hell, it's tasteless, it's cheap, it's puerile and it's tacky - but it's fun. And it's well aware of all that, too. If pooping on people from up on high seems like a larf to you and you have an extra hour to kill and a spare euro/dollar/whatever burning a hole in your pocket, then this is the game for you. For everyone else?... NO POOP FOR YOU!","May 4","true","3.6"," 29 of 43 people (67%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","67","29","43","32","0"

Lots of orientalism and loaded with veeery racist depictions of Chinese people. I'm talking 1800s cartoon depictions. Straight-up looks like yellowface. Ignorant, borderline racist jokes as achievments. They have an achievment called "geisha facial" when geisha are... not Chinese. New York is depicted in a modern setting where people wear suits and drive taxis but in Bejing everyone is wearing ancient costumes, bamboo hats,  the old guys all have fu-man-chu, and people are pulling around hay carts.\n\nI get it, not all games have to be "PC" but this really bummed me out. Wanted to play a fun game where I throw poop on people. Was not expecting racism and orientalism in a game based on such a silly, absurd concept. Very disappointing. If you're not bothered by that kind of stuff, go ahead and purchase it. You'll probably have a good time.","March 14","false","0.3"," 105 of 182 people (58%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","58","105","182","9","7"

I thought this game would be fun to entertain my nephew with when he was old enough to play a video game. However even he woud be bored with this kind of repetatvie game play. Sure poop is funny, anyone can appreciate a good poop/fart joke. The game is kind of glitchy as well. The numbers and people will start to phase into just blocks of color. For example when you see your score sometimes instead of numbers, you'll see red blocks on your screen.\n\nI'd say it's worth what you pay considering you only get three levels. Probably a great present for your child, if they're under 15 years old. Buy at your own risk.","March 18","false","1.4"," 17 of 23 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","17","23","0","0"

What sounds like a pun of a 5 yo turns in a poopthrowing fest in the 3 capitals just formally known for daily poop rain. No matter the way you think of disgust you have to sh*t on ppl to gain many points. I wonder how Steam's extended language control didn't stop this game from the very beginning. It should be funny and challenging. But it's not. Most time you struggle of lack of precise controls. A thick diameter skylight shows your first impact/bounce zone. Then you have to estimate the flight time and bouncing curve. Your charater is honestly said a buttface. If you land a couple of hits new upgrades will be unlocked. Until you release the supersh*t bomb in the end or the 1min shower of brown soup. That's how I ever imagined a sh*tstorm. And the next game is already in the greenlight row: Somekind of disco poop contest.","May 19","false","1.1"," 38 of 62 people (61%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","61","38","62","7","7"

It's silly!\n\nI dunno why people take it too serious. Must been people who complain about this absurdity but enjoy stupid TV shows like Jackass. Or read 50 Shades of Gray. Or listen to the Bloodhound Gang...\n\nYou can buy it for a buck. It's a short game with 3 cities only. So what?\n\nWaiting for your Girlfriend to be ready to go out?

Absolutely hilarious.\nAlthough I will say there's very little replay value.\nbut it would be fun to make others play or watch it for the first time and get reactions. There's maybe an hour of gameplay at a stretch and most of that hour is likely spent getting that last acheivement. The music mechanic is fun though, it's got a catchy song that plays when you're on a streak and cut off abruptly when you fail. It's surprisingly good at motivating you to keep going.\nI'd say it's worth the price you pay for it and then some for the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and giggles you get...\nlitterally\n‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• and giggles.\nehehehehehe","May 4","true","0.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Even in the early days of games like Spacewar on the PDP-1 in 1962, people had the same question: Can I poop on it? Sadly, due to the limits of technology, prejudices amongst retailers, and unfair censorship, this question could not be fulfilled. Thankfully, one developer dares to push the brown envelope and answer this age old question. Some may criticize this game, they may even call it crap, of which I would say, exactly. It is rare to be blessed with such artistic creativity in any form of media, let alone video games. So I raise my glass a safe distance from our defecating hero, and salute you for answering the question gamers have had since the conception of video games.","April 23","true","0.3"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","46","6","13","9","1"

There is three stages including the starting one and to progress through them you have to complete all the objectives in the right hand corner. The objectives can range from getting a high score to crapping in a certain thing. All the stages have a basic crap and one that is unique to that stage. There is a bomb crap, a firework crap, and diarrhea. The game is fun for a little bit but gets repititive within 10-15 minutes. The hit detection could also be improved as there was a lot of times where shots that should have hit the targets missed.

So I had to buy it. My first playthrough I was a little confused on what needed to be done since the game starts you out with only 1 level that you can play. The other 2 are locked until you get the powerup to unlock the next level. I played through it and enjoyed it at first. Then I closed the game and came back a few hours later to see everything was deleted. Then I read the text at the bottom that says kinda "Logging out will reset the game" somewhat in that context. So ok... that's not a bad thing, Then I went to select a character and I had to go outside of the game to subscribe to one. They have no effect on the game besides cosmetic (unless I missed something). I understand this game is meant to be a joke, but I like joke games that are fun playthrough after playthrough. This one had no strategy, no save functionality and no character stats page.

You can move over roofs and washing lines to change your position and you can adjust your targeting. And then you can poop. You can poop on people, on dogs, in coffee cups, in soup bowls, in baskets and carts, in taxis etc. You can even poop in empty ice cones - OMG it's sick. And after hitting most targets on you target list - yes, there is a target list - you enable your special attack. Think of Montezuma's revenge. And then there will be no more stopping you. Yes, it's sick! But it's also fun and I was able to collect all achievements in about two hours.\n\nI would not necessarily recommend to buy this game, but if you receive it as a gift, don't reject it.

Basically the premise of the game is you have a list of things to poop in/on and you try to complete them all. It also has a scoring system so you can try to beat your high score of how many different things you threw poop at. There's really not much more to it than that, it's a simple game really, and kind of feels like a game that I would spend more time on if I were playing it on my smartphone.\n\nWould I recommend people to play this? Yeah, it's fun for a gag and a nice way to kill an hour or so. And it's only $1 so the developers know their target audience. I just hope there's more content in the future, as there's only three levels to play on.\n\nIf you'd like to see a little bit of gameplay of the New York level:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s6c3OBVUx5Q","March 26","true","0.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

A Cautionary Tale of Man's Ambition?  A Doomed Paean to Nonexistant Gods?\nThere's Poop In My Soup = Poop + Soup + Mozart + DaVinci + Lord Byron + Socrates\n\nIt's clear from the get-go that the developer, Rudder Games, set about an unprecedented task of telling the raw human story of existential panic with airs of subtlety that will creep upon you unexpectedly - one might even say silently, but deadly.  Although I must admit I am still cracking the walnut shell of the manifold puzzle and mystery of There's Poop In My Soup, I will attempt to peel away the deliberate obfuscation and touch upon the delicate interior of this postmodern tale.\n\nYou take upon the mantle of a nameless protagonist, clearly feeling isolated and ostracized from the rest of society, artfully symbolized by his or her separation from the crowd below.  The protaginst feels deformed, hideous, and vulnerable, made obvious by being completely nude and having a face that resembles the human derriere.  All attempts to communicate with normal society falls upon deaf ears, or worse, is filtered by the false pulchritude of pop-culture gone mad, rendering simple truthful words into "poop" by their savage reckoning.\n\nYou as the player attempt to break free from your angst-ridden prison by communicating, passionately, perhaps even forcefully, your inner demons and hopelessness that fills the plastic environment around you with inconvenient emotions and startling realizations, piling higher and higher in the form of unwanted excrement.\n\nYou are given certain tasks to complete, such as pooping in soup as in the game's namesake, or an overpriced French coffee, or a young boy's ice cream cone.  Clear statements against society's consumerist disconnect from their food.  Other tasks include richocheting the turds of your experiential dread from one surface into another, symbolic of how one's words can reflect off the milieu that cages us, reverberating off the very walls like wails of constipated anguish.\n\nThis game, which is much more akin to a striking, disturbing. yet bold creation of vanguard art, is also rather short in length.  However, I prefer to think of it as concise, conveying just enough of the message to digest and to allow for us to poop to our own conclusions.\n\nTake this mental laxative if you...\n\nConsider yourself a patron of the arts.\nBelieve that fecal matter represents the last frontier of radical expressionism.\nWant to bounce a poop off of an awning and into a baby carriage.\nPrarie dog it to the next rest stop if you...\n\nAre a brutish philistine.\nAre too sheltered and bashful to possibily understand poop as art.\nCan't see the porta-potty for the latrines.\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThis daring expose of the human condition caught me deligtfully by surprise.  It will challenge your expectations of art, turning them on their head, and then shower them in diarrhea deluge of wit, brashness, and tender honesty.  I was moved to tears of confusion, sorrow, but also joy.  It struck within me an inspiration to create and discover, and to "curl one out" on my own and relish in sights, textures, and smells of the movement.\n\nYou owe it to yourself to not pass on this one.  You'll never look at Steam again in the same way.","March 14","true","2.0"," 320 of 676 people (47%) found this review helpful 375 people found this review funny","47","320","676","375","22"

Quite literally. No, for real.\n\nThe aim of the game is to complete your 'to poo list' and achieve combos and high scores via pooping on people. These tasks are really easy to do and some require trick shots that insist on bouncing the poop at an angle to get it in the bin - Jesus Christ why am I reviewing this... I could be doing something better with my life but nope, I spent $0.89 on a game about pooping on people and play through it and unlock all the damn achievements for it...\n\nI really need to re-evaluate my life...\n\nThere are 3 stages, city based levels which include New York, Beijing, and Paris. You must navigate your protaganists aim and poop at your targets in order to achieve objectives on your list, completing these in a variety of ways and earning combos. There's really not much to it, but its simplicity is fine.\n\nI'd recommend this game to fans of the indie genre, it's a neat little title (even if that title is a bit cr@p...) at a miniscule price and offers around 20-30 minutes of game time, complete with very easy to obtain achievements. I'd recommend playing this game with a friend or if you're a gaming YouTuber who wants some humours content, definitely a title to grab for it's hilarity.\n\nVerdict: 5/10 for being a very simple indie game that doesn't really offer a huge amount of content but scores extra points based on a completely different and weirdly unique idea, as well as it's dirty potty humour. So if you've got the time and money, dive right into this sh!tstorm :)","March 15","true","0.5"," 5 of 23 people (22%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","22","5","23","0","4"

It isn't ruining the gaming industry, there isn't a problem with Steam Greenlight. Go crawl back under the rock you emerged from.\n\nNow that that is out of the way, There's Poop In My Soup is a short casual game about being an ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• (pun intended) and pooping on people in different ways. You have two means of attack per level - your normal poop, where you shoot a poop log in correlation to where the highlighted position is, and a special attack that varies per level from a poop bomb to poop fireworks to a poop fountain spewing out of your butt face. The gameplay is simplistic and your main intention is to finish the objectives in the level and score as many points as possible. As you increase your combo of successful poop assaults, an upbeat musical piece starts playing louder and louder as the level gets more erratic with people running from your ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•-storm.\n\nAt the core, this game is entertaining for what it is. TPIMS doesn't try to be anything to be anything it isn't. However, I will say that the screenshots the game provides are misleading: you cannot change the camera angle which is a real bummer. The other issue is that the area that you highlight to defecate on is not always the area where your poop lands - specifically on the last two levels, the game seems to be less and less accurate as you advance. Whether this is intentional or not, it feels like a design flaw. When you get very high combos, the people sometimes glitch out, their necks stretching across the level or mangled around the piles of poop covered citizens. One more problem that I noticed is that the game saves your progress badly - exiting out won't lose your progress, but to gain it back, you have to individually go into the levels and back out again to regain access to attacks or later levels.\n\nFor the price, I can recommend it. It offered me a bit over an hour of gameplay including getting all the achievements, which were not difficult to get.","March 16","true","1.2"," 8 of 30 people (27%) found this review helpful","27","8","30","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lansov/recommended/449540/","Lansov","( Õ° Õ°¬∞ Õú  ñ Õ° Õ°¬∞ )","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Lansov/","333 products in account","People need to calm down. Yes the dialogue only has 4 options, but 90% of all dialogue in the other Fallout games had 3 to 4 options. The dialogue is my biggest complaint, but It's not that big a of a deal in retrospect. My other complaint is that quests often have 1 ending, I would love to choose from several endings but I do not expect this for every quest.\n\nThe Game is beautiful, it's got a great feel to it and I love the way the world is set up. The dirt may be a boring brown but you find that the Post/Pre-War buildings have a nice color scheme and It makes the game that much more nice looking. As for people who are underwhelmed by the map, C'mon? If you want to be underwhelmed look at New Vegas. The City was an empty pile with 50% of the buildings being unenterable. It had a total of 6 nice looking buildings, That was it!\n\nThe Power Armor makes you feel like an absolute BEAST! I don't mind that they gave me a Minigun and Power Armor in the first 20 mins of the game because the Armor is in bad shape to start with (and after killing a Death Claw it's in worse shape) and after killing everything in that mission I only had 21 shots left on the gun. I droped it because who wants to carry around a useless (and heavy) weapon. The people who are questioning the use of Power Armor in the first 20 mins should take into consideration that it's a way of giving you an incentive to find, craft, and customize your own set(s). In Fallout New Vegas I never bothered with Power Armor because I already had some cool cowboy stuff, and it didn't do that much for me anyways. Not to mention that it looked pretty bad too.\n\nI don't mind the Perk system because they were always the best part about leveling up anyways. I like looking at all the options that are placed before me and planning out my character before I even hit level 5. For this reason alone, I do not agree with the people claiming that "Fallout 4 is not an RPG" off of the grounds that dialogue choice is limited. You get to make your character look the way you want, fight the way you want, join the factions you want, and so on. You get to create a character who is individual to you, just because he/she can't say exactly what you want to say doesn't mean that the game is not an RPG.\n\nNow that I'm done defending the game from common criticism lets talk about what the game did exceptionally well at. The game has amazing sound design, I'll be walking along and all of a sudden I'll hear far off shots. The fact that I can tell what guns are being used, how many people are shooting at eachother and how far off they are from me speaks valumes for the game's sounds. This skill comes in handy more times then you might think.\n\nAnother thing That I like is the looting system. The game feels so much more seemless now that I don't have to look through body after body to find nothing useful. Instead I am given a nice UI that tells me exactly whats is available to loot. I can also choose to go into a more indepth UI if I want to.\n\nCharacter/Enemy design looks and feels great. Ghouls look and act far more "feral". Mole rats have a nice little add on with the ability to go underground and pop out at you. Your Dog now has the ability to pin people down so you can shoot them (Team work is actually a thing now!) and I am overall impressed with how far they came from the "Run at the enemy and block your friend" companions from Fallout and the Elderscrolls games alike.\n\nFinnally, You can have lasting change in a Fallout game. The fact that you can build your own settlment, is the largest change in a Fallout game since the destruction of Megaton. It adds just as much content as being able to say something new, and I like the change. The next related topic is the crafting system, which is extensive. Build what you want were you want. it's a great feeling and I love it.\n\nCons:\n- "I wanna say something else!"\n- "Put the gun, on your back!" (Gun randomly appears when you have to use it)\n- Lack of Quest endings choices\n- Repetative Quests (Like some Skyrim Quests)\n\nPros:\n- Looks Great\n- Sounds Great\n- (Seemless) Feels great!\n- SOOO much crafting\n- Lasting impression on the world!\n\nThis Game IS an RPG, and it stands strong on it's own. I like it! :)","March 15","true","0.9"," 13 of 42 people (31%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","31","13","42","11","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/449540/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1599 products in account","There's Poop in my Soup is a short-lived casual title where you play the role of a toddler who has a butt for a face; yes, much like that amazing South Park episode. The entire goal of the game is to fling your poop down onto unsuspecting people, all the while meeting goals from your To-Poop checklist.\n\nThe game has simple enough mechanics; you maneuver left, right, forward, and backward, all the while deciding who your next poo victim will be. Will it be the mother pushing the stroller? How about the taxi driver? Maybe that unsuspecting, well groomed poodle? It's ultimately up to you, and each person or item you hit will further your combo and score. Once you unlock a set number of goals, you will unlock a special power and a new stage. The power that is unlocked is dependent on which level you are playing on; New York City has a poop bomb, Beijing has poop fireworks, and Paris has Runny Tummy... basically, diarrhea.\n\nYes, there are only three levels in There's Poop in My Soup, which is a big downfall of the title. Each level, along with all of their To-Poop checklist goals, and the achievements, can be completed within 40 minutes to an hour. After that, there is little to no replayability. I will say, however, that the game itself runs great and I had no issues with glitches, bugs, or crashes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/449540/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1599 products in account","There's Poop in my Soup is a short-lived casual title where you play the role of a toddler who has a butt for a face; yes, much like that amazing South Park episode. The entire goal of the game is to fling your poop down onto unsuspecting people, all the while meeting goals from your To-Poop checklist.\n\nThe game has simple enough mechanics; you maneuver left, right, forward, and backward, all the while deciding who your next poo victim will be. Will it be the mother pushing the stroller? How about the taxi driver? Maybe that unsuspecting, well groomed poodle? It's ultimately up to you, and each person or item you hit will further your combo and score. Once you unlock a set number of goals, you will unlock a special power and a new stage. The power that is unlocked is dependent on which level you are playing on; New York City has a poop bomb, Beijing has poop fireworks, and Paris has Runny Tummy... basically, diarrhea.\n\nYes, there are only three levels in There's Poop in My Soup, which is a big downfall of the title. Each level, along with all of their To-Poop checklist goals, and the achievements, can be completed within 40 minutes to an hour. After that, there is little to no replayability. I will say, however, that the game itself runs great and I had no issues with glitches, bugs, or crashes. For a buck o' nine CAD, it's not a bad ride to take; there have certainly been worse in the last few months. I recommend this title since it's a fun and not-so-serious excursion, plus you can imagine pooping on your idiot coworkers...

The last ones I need (total of 750,000 points and 1,000,000 points) are pretty fu cking hard to achieve.

Each has it's own challenges to discover and unique characters to poop on.\n\nThis game is in my own opinion is HILARIOUS. Also it's 99p at full price! Let me put it this way you can buy a fake poo from a shop for ¬£1 and have 5 minutes of fun or spend 99p on this and fufil your dreams of pooping on everyone (sicko).\n\nCheck out my gameplay video for more! - https://youtu.be/wpilAKg6kT4","March 15","true","0.4"," 7 of 31 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","7","31","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/praisecheadle/recommended/449540/","praisecheadle","c5","http://steamcommunity.com/id/praisecheadle/","1138 products in account","There's Poop in My Soup is rough around the edges and could use some polish, but it has enough charm and humor to be worth the 89 cents I paid for it.\n\nThis is basically a sort of space-invaders meets physics chaos type of game. You stand on top of buildings and drop poop on unsuspecting passersby. That might sound like it could get dull, and the game does have a lifespan, but there's a surprising amount to be discovered. There is a huge amount of different trick shots and animations to discover. Certain characters react to the poop differently and you can bounce the poop off of awnings. If you poop on a certain number of people, you unlock little perks, such as more people walking around, or alternate poop weapons. As you only have a finite number of poops per session, you have to replay the level a few times to unlock things. The alternate poop weapons are pretty powerful and allow you to really begin upping your score, but they sacrifice accuracy, so specific outcomes might be harder to predict. Even though you unlock things through the number of people you poop on, the true goal is to get the highest score you can. The fact that you have to replay the levels to achieve the number of people pooped on does lengthen the game, but it does make the early stages a bit slow, and the game truly hits its stride when you've got the maximum people walking around. That said, it is important to start slowly so you can learn each area, so it's not too bad of a progression.\n\nThe game's biggest asset is its charm. The graphical style is cute and hilarious. I love the weird, springy-haired guy who drops the poop, and the random citizens are equally memorable. I love the sound it makes when you poop. The visual style on the menus is clean and slick looking. The ragdoll physics add to the chaos in so many ways that even the developer might not have foreseen. One time I pooped on a guy and he ran out into the street and got hit by a car, only to have his body flung over the buildings. There were several moments where I had genuine, gut laughter from either the physics, the animations, or some secret thing that the game snuck into a level. It's crude stuff, but the game never feels mean-spirited and it lets you in on the joke. On that level, I definitely reccomend this game for its entertainment value.\n\nThe game's biggest failings are in its technical merits. The framerate is choppy and the game feels a bit unoptimized. My PC can max out most games at 60fps, so I should have no problem running a game like this. It does seem to smooth out after playing for a few rounds, but there's no reason for a game like this to lag. The other big issue is that there is not controller support. You have to aim with WASD and this feels a bit too clunky and imprecise to always get the exact shot I'm going for. Most of the time it's not too much of an issue, but it does hold the game back a bit. In a game like this where movement is part of the challenge, it would probably be too easy if you could aim with the mouse, but I think analogue stick movement would be the perfect middleground. I also think the camera on the New York level might benefit from being pulled out a bit, as when you try to aim into the extreme foreground, you can't see where you're actually aiming. The China level does rectify this however.\n\nThere's Poop in My Soup isn't perfect, but for 89 cents it is a funny and charming way to kill a few minutes. The game's biggest issues seem like they could easily be solved with a patch or two, and I hope the developer will keep working on this. It has issues, but I like it.","March 15","true","0.6"," 8 of 34 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","8","34","0","0"

After being fed $50 boring titles by major studios we finally get something fresh and funny. This project is really unusual and so for we may talk revolution, like when Valve decided to move boundaries with Portal, or when Blizzard finished Diablo... So far I don't remember video game being so bold when pushing new ideas. Visually game looks really great, the city is not the mose detailed in history, but good enough. What is a really astounding is how engine handles the large number of NPC on the screen. Animation is smooth and realistic. Thanks to the soundtrack game is even more atmospheric and deep. This game is the most fun you can have for less than $1 In short - if you think you need $5000 system to enjoy pc gaming today - check out this game - you will be pleasently surprised... I only wish devs add editor and co-op, but so far it is solid 9,5/10. Ok, who am I kidding... 10/10","March 15","true","0.2"," 1 of 18 people (6%) found this review helpful","6","1","18","0","0"

It's simple, it's easy to play, and it's a lot of fun. And you get to poop on people all around the world.

But beyond that, they're different games. However, I do know that different people like different things, and this game is definitely not for everyone.

Fun for a short bit and quick hundred percent. At $1 I can reccommend it, if it cost much more than that it would be a no but for the money it\'s worth a shot. The game has only three levels with very limited options however and very little replay value aside from workshop characters you can use. The main Character that makes it worth it is Donald Trump since it allows you to crap all over the world just like the real Donald Trump. I think they could increase the value of this game by making Donald Trump the main playable character and renaming the game \"Donald Trump Simulator\".","June 1","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
