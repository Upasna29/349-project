It wasn't what I considered a Tycoon game. It has potiential though, I wouldn't recommend it yet though.","June 24, 2014","false","5.0"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","11","15","2","0"

This game simulates running a carnival. You can choose state fair, parking lot or backyard... Woohoo! There is also a finite amount of items you can place and no development creativity of your carnival except for placement.\n\nFor this reason I can't recommend this game. It's really boring, and way overpriced. You can typically find this game in simulator bundles for cheap to nothing.\n\nWorth $0.30 or so.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

Obviously it wants to be Roller Coaster Tycoon/Theme Park but without the ability for the player to design custom roller coasters.   Off to a great start! It gets worse.  There's only about 30 objects you can place, and it doesn't really matter where you put them.  You don't need to worry about paths and things, guests just sort of wander in and bounce around.  At best, the game is whackamole as you click through the awful interface to try get your carnies to fix everything.   The buildings are all managed the same way, so there's basically zero differentiation.   Gameplay is overall terrible.\n\nGraphics - ho hum, awful, even for the time.\n\nTechnical problems - it doesn't run in full screen even if you choose that option, it's always in a window.  Unfortunately, this doesn't prevent you from playing the game.\n\nImpossible to recommend - there's so many better games in the genre.","March 24","false","0.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

Silly rides and people that swarm the place. Don't get told what to do you just figure it out. For each individual bench you have to go to the menu and pres the down button several times to choose it, as scroll does not work and then place 1 bench and then do the thing again to place again. Bad game!","January 26, 2015","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
