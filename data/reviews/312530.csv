It features one-hit weapons that will surely finish your opponents with ease, while also leaving you to play tactically so that you dont end up victim of those who face you.\nThere is a vast array of weaponry to take out your foes with, such as the devastating minigun, land mines, revolvers, and even bananas to make your opponents slip. Every weapon will kill you instantly if hit, unless you happen to find armor sprawled around the map.\nOne of the most talked about features in the game is the dedicated button for quaking, which is great for many things such as taunting your opponents or breaking the silence in an awkward situation. Another great feature is the ability to ragdoll your character, which when used at the right moment may lead others to believe you are dead, giving you an advantage  or  leaving you vulnerable to be picked up and possibly thrown off the map or into a trap.\n\nConclusion  Duck game is well worth it's price in my opinion. Playing with friends will lead to a great time, and quite possibly an ended friendship. Overall, the game is well done and it may be one of my favorite games of this year.\n\nI rate it an 10/10, would quack again","July 14, 2015","true","23.4"," 135 of 143 people (94%) found this review helpful 32 people found this review funny","94","135","143","32","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drury27/recommended/312530/","drury27","Drury","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drury27/","144 products in account","Serious review time.\n\nDuck Game is a sidescrolling 2D free-for-all multiplayer platforming shooter. A fairly complex one at that, in fact complexity is the keyword here, it's what keeps the game fresh and at the same time somewhat inaccessible, more about that later.\n\nWatching the trailer, it might seem like a complete clusterduck, and that's what it is, but it's an organized clusterduck, and it's genuinely fun. What I'm trying to say is that this isn't a gimmick game. It doesn't exist solely for youtubers to hit the quack button repeatedly (keep in mind quacking is still an integral and inseparable part of the experience). There is a reason to keep coming back to this game even after the novelty of hearing the same soundfile over and over wears off.\n\nThe crux of gameplay is that you are thrown into the fray with up to 3 opponents, last one standing wins. Generally you start off with no weapons at all and you have to race to obtain them before your opponents do. Most maps are built in such a way that you have either no or very weak weapons near your spawn location, with more powerful ones placed further away, hidden in bizarre places or even locked away.\n\nWhen it comes to weapons themselves, as the trailer says, there is an irresponsible amount, and that's a big part of the complexity of the game. Each weapon works in a different way and to remain at least a bit competitive, you have to be able to properly use all of them, the whole irresponsible amount of them. Not talking about pro level duckgame MLG 1v1 ladder invite prem clan level, just to make it through the average casual match without dying first every single round which is barely any fun.\n\nTo elaborate on the weapons, they work in somewhat eccentric ways. For instance, you have to pump pump action shotguns after shooting them, and forgetting to do so can be fatal. You might find yourself successfully throwing a grenade to find out it's not going off for some reason, then have somebody pick it up, pull the pin, then throw it back at you. Reloading muskets, blunderbusses and bazookas is a very realistic process, and can't be cancelled, making you a sitting duck (pun very intended). Chainsaws are similarly realistic in how they can be thrown to land upside-down, leaking gas on the ground - subsequently sparking a fire with the blade is a possibility. Another quirk of chainsaws is that you can "ride" them by laying down, holding the blade in the desired direction of travel and revving it. Most guns have finite ammo much like Hotline Miami, and empty guns disappear after being dropped.\n\nSwords however, swords work as expected. Swing it to kill a dude. Duck (hehehehe) to block. Throw with the throw key, thrown swords are just as lethal as expected. If somebody flying really fast lands at the tip of the blade, they get impaled, as expected.\n\nThen there are some outright outlandish weapons that I've never seen in any other MP game, such as mind control gun that literally allows you to take control of the victim while the trigger is pulled, a net gun that shoots, well, nets, that trap your opponents, allowing you to pick them up and throw them into hazards, or the mooninite gun (consult Aqua Teen Hunger Force for details). Then there are weapons that seem outright useless at first, such as literal nerf guns and books, but everything can be lethal if the conditions are right.\n\nAll of above is just a fraction of the game's complex mechanics (not even going into said conditions when nerf guns are useful). It may all seem kind of gimmicky, but everything has a place in the game and it makes for a mostly balanced fun (mind control gun is as evil as it sounds though). The game does do a pretty good job explaining itself, though.\n\nSome people prefer to jump straight into MP, as I did, and then finding everything very confusing, counter-intuitive and generally not fun. For those of us, there is the singleplayer component. "Singleplayer component" might be too strong a term, it really is just a tutorial/training mode. One that will take several hours to complete, not gonna lie. It does a pretty good job explaining the monumental amount of game mechanics, though. And yet, it still does omit a fair share that you discover by playing MP, but at least it does a good job easing you into the game and allowing you to actually enjoy it online the way it was meant to be played.\n\nOne thing that does a fairly good job helping you overcome the complexity is the control scheme. Putting this upfront - there's a negative review criticising the default control scheme and I have to absolutely agree, it's atrocious. I don't remember what it was before I turned it upside-down (pretty much the first thing I did in the game), but it had up arrow for jumping which confuses some people attempting to ride their chainsaws.\n\nOther than the bindings, which can be easily changed, there are some measures taken to streamline complex interactions with the game. Other than basic movement keys (jump, duck, left, right), there are five vital functions: Grab/throw, use, strafe, limp and quack. Of these, you'll be mostly using the first two (and the last one). As complex and eccentric as the game is, the control scheme is very easy and doesn't stand in the way. However due to said eccentric nature of the game, certain basic actions require a lot of keystrokes - equipping a full set of armor and a sword requires you to rapidfire grab/use (with fast fingers, it will still take less than a second).\n\nOnce you get used to it, it's all about quick reflexes and making the most of your options - as you would expect out of a proper MP game. It's fast, it's complex, and the strategies being employed by skilled players can be mindboggling - one dude predicted three of us to run into a room with the flamethrower, so the clever ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ placed a box against the door from outside, preventing anyone to escape the fiery hell, including the guy who picked up the flamethrower (me). As we burned to death inside, he played a trumpet outside, next to a fire extinguisher.\n\nWell worth the asking price.","February 2","true","19.4"," 102 of 109 people (94%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","94","102","109","19","1"

Note that he has been dead since long before Duck Game graced this Earth. Were he alive today, he would simply have said "Happiness is when ducks are placed in arenas to fight in glorious free-for-alls with all kinds of crazy and fun weapons." No doubt This was Ghandi's message, but English wasn't his first language.

These challenges give you major insights into lesser known mechanics of the game, which can give you that little edge in combat.  Through winning challenges you get Tickets, which you can spend not only to buy hats, but also GAMEPLAY MODIFIERS for multiplayer!\n\nDid I mention there's a dedicated Quack Button?

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/StaySkeptic/recommended/312530/","StaySkeptic","StaySkeptic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/StaySkeptic/","217 products in account","DISCLAIMER: THIS IS NOT A CRITIQUE OR MEANT TO BE WELL WRITTEN/ENTERTAINING REVIEW, IT"S JUST ME EXPLAINING AND RECCOMENDING IT.\n\nDuck Game is an Ouya game pored to Steam, published by Adultswim. It's a 4 player 2d sidescrolling versus game. 2 vs 2 is also possible. Similar to towerfall, players die in one hit and then go to the next level when everyone is dead.\n\nFirst when starting it up you'll notice the great sega genesis style soundtrack.\nSecond, you'll notice presenation is great. For example the main menu is navigated by actually walking to the options, and it is a nice looking menu.\nWhen you start the game, you'll be thrown into a little waiting lobby that also explains the controls. You can change your profile here, and pick what hat you want to wear. You have to destroy the glass next to you to step into a beam and start floating in it. When you get into the beam you can either find a multiplayer game or play or, play the single player arcade missions. If another person is there, you can play locally instead.\n\nThe gameplay of Duck Game is simple. 4 people get thrown into a level, and in that level weapons and items are scattered throughout the map quake style, or hidden in blocks which you have to jump into like in Mario. The objective is ofcourse to kill eachother with these weapons. Everything is a one hit kill. When everyone is dead the person who survives gets a point and the next map loads. When 1 person has 10 points the game ends. The controls are simple. You move with the directional keys, and you have a jump and a shoot button. If you press down you can slide, which you can use to slide under small places. Unique to Duck Game is a dedicated button to pick the weapons up. When weapons or items are picked up, the player can throw them with the same button. These throwing physics are very well implemented. The movement speed is fast, and you're in pretty much full control of your jumps. If you jump and let go of the right or left button you'll almost immidiately fall. If you jump, and hold the jump button in mid air you'll slowly descent to the ground. There's also a feign death button, not sure what it's for but it's nice.\nOh, and there's a dedicated quack button, to, well, just make a quack sound.\nThe game is fast paced, chaotic fun. It's very easy to pick up and play. There's always funny moments to be had. People accidentally suiciding in the most stupid way right after winning and thus not awarded a point for example.\n\n\nMost weapons are bullet based, and have a bit of a random spread. You also ofen can't see the ammo you have left. With some guns there's knockback, which gets higher when you crouch. They kind of work like incredibly fast projectiles, and the range varies. What you'll notice is that seemingly, you can only shoot sideways. On the surface it seems like Duck Game has no depth to it and is just casual fun. However, when playing for a while you'll notice there's quite a few things to get good at. First of all, many weapons have their own unique little quirks. A small thing is that many weapons require the button to be pressed again to for example eject shells before they can be shot again. You can mostly just shoot left and right, but aiming can actually be more skillfull then you think for a 2d game like this. You can walk through enemies, and when standing in an enemy the gun often can't hit that person, which happens a lot because of the fast movement. When you throw a weapon hard enough at your enemy, the enemy's weapon drops.\nWhen you jump and hold down the jump button in mid air, not only will you slowly descent, but your weapon will point upwards, so you actually can shoot up. Not only can you do this, but you can actually shoot up diagonally. Since the gun doesn't point up immidiately, if hold the jump button and almost immidiately press the shoot button right after, you'll shoot diagonally.\n\nThe revolver has kickback, so if you keep shooting you can shoot diagonally with the recoil.\nFor the grenades you press the shoot button to take the pin off, and then you can throw it in any direction with the other button, and the physics (and the ease of killing yourself) of it make it a skillful weapon to use.\nThe grenade launcher not just arcs and then explodes on contact, but when you hold it down it goes up, so you can aim it. The longer you hold the button the more upward it aims.\nThe chainsaw has to be activated by pressing shoot twice, and after, you can do all kinds of crazy movements with it.\nWith the hammer you can also effect your movement but in a different way, and since it's heavy you can kill someone by dropping it.\nThere's an net gun that has a fast arcing projectile which traps your enemy, and then you can pick your enemy up and throw him out of the map.\nThere's a flamethrower and flame gun that can be extinguished by fire extinguishers, and the nerf gun ammunition catches on fire when shot at the flamethrower.\nAnd there's more. 2 shotguns (with 1 you can see your ammo left on the gun itself), a few pistol's,  a minigun, a sword you can also throw kill people with (and slash downwards in the air), lasers that bounce off of walls, a small laser gun you can charge up, a gun you can charge up for a HUGE laser, the mooninites gun from Aqua Teen Hunger force that shoots a really slow moving square and has a big knockback effect when shot, a magnet gun to push people off the map, a gun that turns people into you, a rocket launcher that destroys terrain, a sniper rifle, a rifle with a really long reload time, some thing powerful that I forgot, a flaregun, mines, an uzi type thing and an earthworm jim type gun, and a suicide gun. I think I got most of them. There's enough vereity in weapons to be had here, although I'd love there to be more interesting projectile weapons.\n\nAside from weapons, There's sometimes jetpacks and grappling hooks to find for movement, and there's body armor, a helmet and shoes(against spikes).\n\nas far as the levels themselves go, you can pick up blocks in certain levels that you can use to block bullets with. There's other blocks you can use to block doors with. There's keys you can pick up to open certain doors with better weapons. There's hazards such as spikes. There's oil drums you can shoot to make all the oil come out. There's windows that can be broken open when pressing down or shooting on them. In a few levels there's teleporters you can actually shoot in and the nyour bullets come out of the other portal. What's cool is that there's a level editor, but an issue is that you can't play these online yet. Otherwise there's some crashes, and there's no game browser to speak of, only automatic matchmaking.\n\nThe singleplayer arcade missions are not that special, but they're a nice addition. Some of them are pretty fun. They're missions such as shoot as many targets as you can in a certain amount of time, or finish an obstacle course as quickly as possible, etc. You can either get a bronze, silver, golden or blue medal, and the better the medal the more tickets you get to spend on a few gameplay modifiers and hats.\n\nDuck Game is not as competetive as something such as Towerfall but it does have a good skill ceiling, despite it at first glance seeming like it lacks depth. If you like games like Towerfall, Super Mario War and Samurai Gunn, be sure to give this one a try, especially since it has online multiplayer.","June 18, 2015","true","12.3"," 28 of 29 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","28","29","0","0"

Win ten rounds and waddle away from those other loser ducks as you leave with the trophy. The game also has single player mini-game challenges for a variety of gameplay.\n\nThis is still one of me and my friends' favorite go to games.\n\nPROS:\n* A Very Enjoyable Experience, especially with "Local Multiplayer" for up to 4 players (why isn't there a 4-pack option in the Steam store) Added now\n* Lots of varying weaponry (and defenses) make each level feel non-repetitive.\n* There are a few different ways to play, but most of the time this feels akin to Smash Brothers (and that's a positive for me).\n\nCONS:\n* I just wish that the match making could invite friends into a game. Fixed now!\n\nVerdict: A Worthy Purchase! Recommended if you like arena brawlers, and highly recommended for its local multiplayer.\n\nI play this often in our house, and Steam Family Sharing makes this a great investment for a family or group of friends. I would have purchased a 4-pack for my friends and family; however, the Steam store originally only sold the game individually.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kt_extinction/recommended/312530/","kt_extinction","KT_Extinction","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kt_extinction/","1026 products in account","Duck Game is great.\n\nHow great? That really depends on several factors. If I was comparing this with anything else, it would be asking if you like Super Smash Brothers. Super Smash Brothers, in my opinion is only 5/10 if you’re by yourself, but a solid 10/10 when you get a couple guys to play with. Duck Game fares similarly, being a competitive, 2D, PVP focused game with skill based platforming and reaction time. The difference is that Duck Game has the one hit kill intensity found in Samurai Gunn. The kicker is that you can’t attack if you don’t have a weapon, so the start of the match is just a rapid scrambling for firearms and panicked firing. It’s an intense, skill based shootout that I hope to be playing for the next 10 years at least.\n\nDuck Game’s true greatness is its subtleties present in its design. At first it may seem constraining to not be able to aim in all directions like you would expect, but you eventually find that if you’re pressed up against an object your duck aims upward, still allowing you to fire. A particular gun that looks like a giant magnum recoils with each shot, letting you aim slightly higher to hit enemies, essentially you exploit a handling characteristic of the weapon into a game mechanic. The ducks can even float around on stubby wings and slide on their knees if you duck while running (ha ha), allowing you to do Matrix-like dodges against your enemies. Really great stuff, with a high skill ceiling but still easy enough to allow new players to get the drop on more experienced ones, which is the “sweet spot” I adore in competitive games. There’s a button completed dedicated to quacking (SERIOUSLY) which adds a layer of absurdity and humor to the already ridiculous setting that Duck Game takes place in.\n\nOne fear I have is the staying power of the online community. Too many indie games, have I bought on a super-sale only to see that the fan base has since moved on to other games. Duck Game is still relatively new as of 6/22/2015, so finding a game isn’t too difficult, but I really, really REALLY hope this game has longevity in the future. Like I said, 10 years please. One of the upsides this game has over Samurai Gunn is its near perfect online gameplay, which I hope keeps the game alive. I only had a couple of disconnects but the lag never really messed with me too bad. Even if the online dies out, with the local play, all it requires really is a couple of controllers and a few brewskies to have a great time. I love this game.\n\nQuack Quack, Mother ♥♥♥♥er","June 22, 2015","true","65.1"," 24 of 24 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","24","24","3","0"

They have a great catalog of games that they have published. Despite this, I was skeptical about Duck Game. The concept seemed silly. I just didn't see what the appeal was. However I was happily proven wrong. Duck Game is a insanely fun and frantic game. While the game does feature a single player arcade mode. The main highlight is the multiplayer. Which is a blast from the first to last match.\nWith weapons and strategies flipping and changing constantly as you go through the 50 levels. That might be a small room with grenades. A forest area with four sets of Knight's armor. Perhaps a futuristic set up with teleporters and plasma weapons. The combinations are always fresh and keep things moving at an exhilarating pace. With simple controls anyone can just jump in and instantly start having fun. With more experienced players having an advantage knowing what weapons do what. Aesthetically Duck Game is also surprisingly pleasing as well. With nice level design, hats, and enough quacking to make Emilio Estevez blush.\nThe only negative I can point out is that the game has a bad habit of crashing. Randomly, without reason. This could be a day 1 bug and hopefully eventually patched out. However as multiplayer is the primary draw here. It's something to keep in mind. If your looking for a good way to blow off steam with friends or online. Duck Game is great choice for a party game. I only wish there was an 8 player mode for some truly dynamic insane matches.\n\nI made a video review to show off some of the features and gameplay of this game!\nhttps://youtu.be/j8vHOzhr-_c\nI hope you enjoy!\nMartyr","June 4, 2015","true","2.8"," 15 of 19 people (79%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","79","15","19","5","0"

I'm surprised PETA ain't after these guys for their representation on Ducks. I've played a lot more with friends than I have alone.\n\nThen again, Ducks have never been able to hold guns before or wear knight helmets. The object of this game can vary game mode to game mode. The game play itself is not too bad although quite simple. Generally in multiplayer, players will have to kill one another to be the last one standing. Multiplayer can be played locally with friends/family or can be played over the internet. The movement within the game is decently well rounded. Ducks can jump and sort of have the ability to "fly" (more so glide). They can flap their wings but never gain any altitude, only slow their descent. Ducks may also grab (either items, explosives or guns). You can also trip yourself in game (which I'm assuming is for dodging. Although it's a little weird and doesn't exactly make sense). Strafing is also a feature in the game as well as the ability to quack. Yes, being a duck you can quack.\n\nLevels themselves come in all shapes and sizes. This is a great feature because it really can make the difference in the game. Some levels are super small while others have some good length to them. Weapons available for pickup are scattered throughout the maps. Some weapons require you to unlock a door before you can proceed to pick up the weapon. This can cause a race between players to get the only weapon on the map. Weapons themselves are drastically varied. They come in the form of pistols, muskets, net guns (don't do damage but displace the player or allows you to throw them off a cliff), machine guns, shotguns, grenades, grenade launchers and rocket launchers. Some weapons take time to reload while others simply run out of bullets and force you to pick up another weapon. The game is unique in the sense of it's score keeping. Between "x" amount of games, there will be a cut-scene where your ducks are throwing their "marker" (be it a rock, a hat, a helmet or a log). This cut-scene is meant to show who is in the lead. After the games are set and done, players can watch a televised "news re-cap" of the previous games. This is actually quite neat to watch some of the replays with friends.\n\nSingle player resembles multiplayer but will throw the occasional mission your way. You may need to raid a specific location, grab a specific item then leave the level in one piece. You will be rated either gold, silver or bronze depending on the speed you complete the mission. You can visit a booth to buy small upgrades in order to speed up your mission progress. The visuals themselves are as basic as NES graphics but try their best to display every little detail. This may sit well with some while others may not be able to get over the simplistic graphics. The sounds[/n] are okay but I feel a little more variety regarding the explosions and maybe even quacks could have been added. Muskets and other gun shot sounds are as accurate as NES sounds can get.\n\nOverall, not too bad of a game. I think the price is up for question but on a sale I would recommend grabbing if you got a few friends on standby to play with. 1 player mode is fun but local is a lot more fun. Some may find this game neat while others may find it repetitive. I'll give it a recommendation but with caution as some may find it boring after playing a few games.\n\nIndie game rating : 7.35/10\n\nRATING : 6.95/10\n\nScreenShots :\nMan down\n\nHow the game keeps a tab on scores","March 22","true","0.8"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","2"

Introducing Duck Game: The new "coffee break MMO shooter" that falls in line with these previous two classics.\n\nDuck Game is a silly hyper-blast-processing shooter that takes place over several rounds. The goal is simple- shoot everyone else, don't die. Play saxaphone. Quack.\n\nThere is a ton of guns, stages, crazy unlockables, hats, more hats, and hilarious situations to dig yourself into.\n\nThe controls are simple: There's a button to pick up a weapon, a button to shoot the weapon, and jumping and moving. The controls are so simple in fact that the developers decided to make basically almost all the remaining buttons on your controller do absolutely useless things that increase the PVP experience, in a style similar to gestures in "Dark Souls". You have a dedicated quacking button, you have a pressure sensitive button that changes the pitch of your quack, even a button that makes you ragdoll on the ground (actually useful sometimes)\n\nIt's kind of hard to say more about Duck Game. I'm not sure how active the online will be, but I think it'll be a game that's more fun with friends anyways. If you like fast paced shooters that aren't serious at all, pick this up ASAP.","June 9, 2015","true","25.7"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It feels like a mix of Blackthorne and smash brothers. I first heard about it from TotalBiscuit , and have been in love with it ever since.\nThe multiplayer is where the real fun is at, where up to four people play either free-for-all or on teams until they're the last duck(s) standing. It only takes one hit to kill another duck, so there's a lot of strategy involved in trying to kill other ducks while keeping yourself alive. The weapons are quite varied, but far from useless. A dueling pistol only able to fire a single shot a few feet against a chain gun sounds like a bad matchup, but you'd be surprise what you can accomplish with some quick moves and a little bit of mind games thrown in.\nThe single player is also very well done. While it's just a set of levels with goals and timers, it becomes addicting to try to get the best medal on all of them, and unlock as many hats and game modifiers as possible. It's also a great way to learn all the ins and outs of the gameplay so you're better prepared for the chaos that ensues in multiplayer.","July 13, 2015","true","496.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

A single match could be as short as a second or two but they come with a bunch of laughs. There are so many weapons (some more useful than others) and some of them are easter eggs too so keep your eyes out for them. The music is in Sega Genesis style and very fitting for the goofy and intense gameplay.\n\nBut by far the best part about this game is that there is a dedicated button just for quacking! putting a quack or ten after winning a match can turn a rageful loss into a burst of laughs. Also for all you show-offs out there, there are a bunch of silly hats to wear and you can even steal other player's hats too.\n\nOverall this game is very cheap and worth every penny.

The only thing i currently dream of is QUACK QUACK QUACK. Guys help!\n\nOkay, on to the more serious stuff (this entire part has been added since the creation of this review). Duck Game is, with no doubt, one of the best games ive ever played. It is absolutely hillarious. So how does the game work? Well:\n\nDuck Game is a lot like Smash Bros. in how the levels are, but the gameplay is very different. It is very fast pased, seeing as all of the attacks are instant kills. All of the items are good, with each having their respective ups and downs. (Except for swords. Swords are OP.) There is a huge variety of levels and if you include customs there is A LOT of them. You can also easily make your own levels. Now, lets get going to the ups and downs.\n\nPros: Really nice graphics and soundtrack. The soundtrack does however get kind of boring after a while seeing as there is around 8 tracks. The game has very intense gameplay and the rounds are very quick. This makes it so that the game can very easily be picked up, played for a few rounds and then you can just move on. There is a huge variety of weapons that you can use to beat the living ♥♥♥♥ out of your friends and lots of maps.\n\nCons: Ive gotta be honest with ya, while this game has its share of cons, it's still one of my all time favorite games. Just keep that in mind. Okay, cons. The game has a lot of glitches, most of them just improve on how fun the game is thou. But, if everyone were to master these glitches, the game would be crap. (I should seriosly stop abusing this stuff). The music is, again, very repeadative. The online mode of this game is very fun, but there is a lot of mean people online and there is not many people that play the game. So, you might have a hard time finding a game.\n\nBest. Game.

In it, you can have a match with up to 4 people and be on teams or play free for all. You spawn in randomly in a small map that you can see all the time and you need to find weapons in '!' blocks. Obviously once you find a weapon, you need to go find your target. Each round lasts about 20 seconds (because 1 hit = insta death unless you find armor). The goal is to get the most points by the end of the game. Not to mention therer is hats. You can either unlock hats, download them from the Workshop, or make your own and share it with friends. Also, there is a level editor. Once you finished your level, you can upload it to the workshop just like you can with hats. I usually play about 100 rounds before taking a break when playing this game, and just because the rounds are short doesn't mean you will get bored quicker. Its just fast pace, where you want to play your cards right and avoid anything that can kill you. Did I mention that there is a mind control weapon located in certain maps? It lets you take control of your opponent if you can manage to sap them with the beams and make them jump off a cliff. I did this and managed to make 3 of the other ducks drop their weapons and walk off cliffs. This is unique and coded very nicely. Each time I launch it I notice I burn a few hours of my day away on it. Lastly, there is arcade. Just a place where you can go pratice your skills on non-moving ducks. Over all, this is a great game.","August 26, 2015","true","20.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Some people say that the keyboard controls are crappy, I call ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t on that, I can win most matches I get in, crush friends, and generally get platinum on all the challenges with a keyboard. If that is crappy, I don't know what isn't. Overall this game has a few flaws, which are being solved by the dev, who is obviously extremely busy  (just look at the community hub).

You see them everywhere. But what makes Duck Game different from the others?\n\n-For starters it's not just a platformer. It's highly multiplayer based with elements of strategy, shooter and a hint of "Smash Bros" if you catch my drift\n-There's no real "Story Mode" like in other high action, 16-bit, indie platformers. (shortened to HA16BIP for the remainder of this review) The single player mode consists of several challenges to help hone your skills and become the ultimate Duck Game champion\n-Other HA16BIP's have you traversing through different levels in a consecutive order to reach an end goal. Duck Game doesn't have that. Going back to my "hint of 'Smash Bros'" from earlier Duck Game pins you against up to three other ducks in a fight to the death on a decent variety of randomized levels. (With a few joke levels sprinkled in)\n-Being made by Adult Swim Games it has humor you would expect from a typical Adult Swim cartoon, with examples ranging from the previously mentioned joke levels to a dedicated quack button\n\nAlthough my hours on this game at the time of this review are ok at best (I have my subpar internet to blame for that) I implore you to try this game for yourelf if you want a HA16BIP that's drastically different than your standard HA16BIP or even if you just like Adult Swim.

This game actually is an insanely fun game especially if you have real life friends to play with.  The best way to play the game is hooking it up to your TV and playing it on the couch with some friends with physical controllers. However as most people ( and me) hardly have friends it still is very fun to play online with random people. Playing it with your friends not taking it serious and calling eachother ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s is so fun and actually is what this game seems to be made for.\nTranslation for ducks:\nQuack.  quack quack quack.. quack : quack : quack,,, quack quack quack    quack quack quack? quackquack quack quack!

It just would have been nice if it chose to remember that control scheme for longer than a month before I had to rebind the keys again.\n\nSo then after choosing from an assortment of wild and wonderful hats, I headed straight into the single player!\n\nAnd let's say things went downhill from there.\n\nAfter playing through most of the single player, which are just pretty lack luster training missions with the added incentive of beating your own times and your friends. Great, but I was lead to believe that there was a game in here somewhere? You know, with ducks, aside from myself and that arcade owner.\n\nAha! The multiplayer! Finally, I can have all the fun of-\n"HOST DISCONNECT"Well, OK, that was annoying, next lobby I guess-\n"Matched up with 3 other players with over 30 hours of game-time that means I have no chance"*Sigh* I know I could train more in the single-player, but I just want to have a fun time, please let the next lobby be better\n"1 Duck has 100+ ping, and has a basically non existent hitbox"\n"1 Duck has the spam guns that ALWAYS land for him but never for anyone else"\n"1 Duck abuses glitches to go through walls and on top of the map"\n"1 Duck proceeds to write a review on Steam (guess who that could be)"Oh, and there is no server browser by the way, I have heard that they will be adding one in a future update, so I may change my review based on future updates, and if I can find reasons to give it a positive.\n\nWell, it could just be I ended up with the short end of the bread-stick and that I'm just getting really unlucky with these match-ups, so I suppose I'll just play with my friends.\n\nAt least I would, If I had friends ;-;\n\n*5 hours later after leaving breadcrumbs to my lobby*\nGreat, now we can have a nice casual game with friends, either like how I thought this game would be with the aforementioned Jerma vs STAR_ video with them messing around, or just a fun game of 1v1v1v1!\n\n*30 minutes later*\nWasn't as bad as the online lobby, but you can only play so much without it becoming 'samey', as the rounds are always won by THAT ONE DUCK, you know, THAT DUCK, the one with the sunglasses and the 100+ hours of game-time.\n\nWell, I've learned I either need to spend 30+ hours in the stale single-player, try matchmaking against people who will serve me my duck on a silver plate, or just mess around with friends, which is OK and lasts for around 10-15 minutes.\n\nI really am dissapointed, I am writing this because I needed to just wanted to express some of these disappointments, in vain that someone can help with them, or just commenting on the review telling me to "GET GUD NUB, QUACK" , and remember, I am just writing this from what I got from playing. Opinions are wonderful aren't they?\n\nDISCLAIMER: Some of following issues below I have may be specific to just my experience, but nonetheless, they were my experience, so they were ultimately what affected my view on this game.\n\nNow I present to you! The three spin-off game titles, being the biggest issues I had!\nLuck Game - A lot of my deaths were my opponent getting a lucky shot with a spam weapon or them spawning next to a good weapon while I got a tin-foil hat. Team Fortress 2 would be proud. Oh and that sword throw that always kills me? Not gonna let me pull it off even though we are in the exact same scenario again? Oh, and is your net that LITTLE bit slower? Tough break, they get the weapon first, but hey, to make you feel better, we'll spawn you next to a pistol, and the enemy next to a mini-gun! Better LUCK next time! Eh? eh? ... I'll see myself out.\n\nBug Game - Probably the most unstable game I have played in a good while, (this may be due to the fact I'm on Windows 8.1, please send pity letters to PO BOX - QUACK) Alt-tabbing out? Crash. One in every 100 deaths? Crash. Booting the game? Fine! Oh.. wait... my entire save file has been deleted. Great. Oh and a crash for good measure. This is probably something I'm just experiencing, but it's still a factor for this review. And there seem to be a number of bugs in-game such as 'ghosting' players, messed up item sprites, and the good old wall that can be glitched through by stacking boxes near it, etc and etc.\n\nBlock Game - Don't argue with any item that blocks. It will protect enemies from point blank grenades, a variety of different guns, and can even kill you, if they throw the item at you, or disarm you with it to get your gun. And what? You expected the blocking item they were using to block the weapon YOU just used on them? Ha ha ha... I'm dead.\n\nThe last time this game was updated was the 17th September 2015, and with no updates since, I will be keeping this review until I see fit. I really want to like this game, so hopefully either the community (*chuckles*) or devs can show me otherwise. It really does pain me to write this, which is why I did such a long review with some "humour" to keep guys reading.\n\nI wouldn't mind practising at this game to get better, aka "git gud", but it feels not worthwhile when quite a few times there just will be rounds lost because of the issues I've mentioned, e.g, the infrequency hit-boxes, lucky spawns (which DO exist in some maps), or the weird nature of 'blocking' items, found several times not just by me, but in lobbies with friends.\n\nTL;DR\nPros:\nNicely detailed graphics\nNostalgic 2D style\nSoundtrack reminds me of the old Sega console games\nMod support, and lots of it\nRange of levels and weapons\n\nCons:\nShort single-player\nMatchmaking is unforgiving (or I'm the unluckiest duckling)\nAnd 3 other issues which I can't help but go into detail on\n\nFinal Verdict\nWill you like this game?\nYes, there a lot of elements you will most likely enjoy, these are just personal issues that made the game a bit negative for me, as while my friends like this game,they have seen similar issues, just not to the same extent.\n\nShould you buy this game?\nYes, but perhaps wait for a sale, £9.99, $12.99, 881.89 Indian Rupees, is a tad steep. Just a tad.\n\nWhy are you hating on this game then if you see so many positives?\nIf you have been reading through, you'll know I'm not hating, as I've said before, I really want to enjoy this game, I really do, but with the bugs and matchmaking issues that I personally am seeing, it's hard to give the thumbs up just yet, some people may understand where I'm coming from, others may not, and as long as you find fun in the game and don't blindly fan-duck at me for my review, that's fine by me.\n\nThank you for reading, and have a good day.\n\nEdit\nAlso, there is apparently an issue with the online system, which will lead you to reconnect to the same lobby where someone is AFK until they close it, not an issue I've seen, but some of my friends have had.","January 30","false","19.0"," 143 of 281 people (51%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","51","143","281","21","20"

I was wrong. I think it'll appeal to nearly everyone, as it's just stupid, good fun! It's funny, yet doesn't technically make any jokes itself, it leaves all of that to you. I love the fact that it has a level editor in the game itself, making it easier to make levels, especially compared to other games. It's also very easy to set up or join a match. Again considering what it's like on other games. It also somehow makes it so the gameplay itself is fun, although that leads me onto my next point; the single player. The single player isn't the worst ever... But it is FAR from the best. Very challenging, which the "I hate myself" side of me loves. But the bigger portion of me thinks it's over the top. I think it's a silly idea to make it so thatyou have to play the rubbish half of the game to make the already fun part of the game that bit more fun... Just why? Apart from that this game is A-mazing... That was stupid why did I say that?","January 10","true","51.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A level editor with Steam Worskhop support and a (balls-hard) singleplayer arcade mode is icing on the cake. Honestly, apart from the really excellent control remapping/on-screen prompt restyling, I'd say the quacking is the best part: you don't need to rage, because you can just quack furiously. The hats are pretty nice too, my favorite being the pilot's cap.\n\nIf you like Smash but dislike the toxicity that sometimes comes with it, maybe try this out.","November 19, 2015","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's designed to be frantic and fun.\n\nIf you run out of maps or need somewhere fresh to frag each other, The steam workshop hosts a strong community of user made maps. The Level Editor is a little tricky to understand at first, but once you get the hang of it, you too may contribute your own content to the workshop for others to play on.\n\nFans of Sega Mega Drive will adore the nostaglic sound palette and familiar backgrounds and landscapes too.

It's a game where you could constantly kill your closest friends, and you still wouldn't rage at each other... It's a game you say, "Lets just see what random death can we get next", you don't play this game to be good; you play it to enjoy every minute of it. This isn't a game for you to play with a person who constantly brags about how they get their kills, no.... This game is for those you want to hear say "Damn, that was a hilarious way to die." Not even a GG could cover it, the only true way you can play a game that you have a specific button to quack with is to just have fun with it and no matter how many ways the media puts violent video games being the cause for murderers, this game doesn't teach you to want to murder... It teaches you to have fun with your friends on a game about ducks killing each other. An Adult Swim Game. Adult Swim.. Made something like this? That's where the brilliance of Adult Swim comes through this. And most of all... Quack quack quack... Quack quack quack quack quack... QUACK QUACK QUACK QUA- SHUT UP BOB! To be honest, for a game about killing ducks, this is fantastic. I have no problems giving this game a 10/10. Go ahead and see for yourself :)","October 12, 2015","true","53.2"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

It's a game where you could constantly kill your closest friends, and you still wouldn't rage at each other... It's a game you say, "Lets just see what random death can we get next", you don't play this game to be good; you play it to enjoy every minute of it. This isn't a game for you to play with a person who constantly brags about how they get their kills, no.... This game is for those you want to hear say "Damn, that was a hilarious way to die." Not even a GG could cover it, the only true way you can play a game that you have a specific button to quack with is to just have fun with it and no matter how many ways the media puts violent video games being the cause for murderers, this game doesn't teach you to want to murder... It teaches you to have fun with your friends on a game about ducks killing each other. An Adult Swim Game. Adult Swim.. Made something like this? That's where the brilliance of Adult Swim comes through this. And most of all... Quack quack quack... Quack quack quack quack quack... QUACK QUACK QUACK QUA- SHUT UP BOB!

No server browser yet (matchmaking is automatic).\nNot buggy. Most of the bugs are just amusing rather than taking away from your experience. Duck Game has its occasional crashes (what game doesn't?), but they're almost always caused by alt-tabbing in and out.\nStill being patched and content is still being added. Devs are friendly and responsive on the forums.\nArcade time-trial SP mode which isn't as good as MP, but that's only because MP is so good. Offers a good challenge and a chance to hone some useful skills to use in MP.\nAdvice to anyone thinking of purchasing Duck Game:\n\nA controller is highly, highly recommended. The keyboard controls are pretty crap.\nThe vanilla levels have a lot of RNG in them. If that's not your thing, you can hand-pick a list of Steam Workshop levels and play those.\nThe playerbase outside the US isn't very big. If you live somewhere that's not the US, you will probably have some trouble finding games. You can play with Americans by changing your download region.\nOverall, it's worth your $13. I could have paid $30 and I still would feel like I got my money's worth and then some. Highly recommended, especially if you have friends to play with.\n\nObligatory self-plug: learn how to dominate the singleplayer mode with my video guides. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwP2w-CvTMwMdEUiVznXlL0IMakAnOLIF","August 23, 2015","true","195.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Not only that, but there's even a Quack button which brings the game to a whole other level compared to its competitors.

It's amazing. It's hilarious. It's frustrating. It's incredible.\n\nThe hardest I have ever laughed is while playing this WeToddDid (seriously? Re tarded is censored?) game.\n\nIt's unpredictable and at the same time surprisingly deep.\n\nIt's a thinking man's game. The type of man who will have a plan on precisely how to destroy every other player on the map before the starting timer is finished. The type of man who just put his controller through the nearest window in a fit of rage because he was the first to die due to a block randomly thrown across the map by someone who wasn't even trying to hit him.\n\nIt's a creative man's game. The type of man who knows exactly how a grenade will ricochet, or how high a bouncepad will send him, or how far he can get on a tank of jetpack fuel. And who is constantly coming up with new and unusual ways to showboat at the end of a match, whether it's humping the body of a dead opponent, a suicidal high-dive timed to coincide with the winning "ding", or a sword through his own face.\n\nIt's an idiot's game. The idiot who knows nothing about the game or weapons, but by flailing randomly on the controller he can manage to throw, shoot and blunder his way through the map, causing havoc in the plans of others and hilarity for all.\n\nIt's the focused man's game. The man who can spend hours honing particular skills. The man who will take the time to practice with the dueling pistol for hours on end on custom maps he created to prepare for any eventuality. He moonwalks constantly, never showing you his back. Any weapon you grab is quickly knocked away by a well-placed empty weapon or block thrown into your face. As quickly as the round starts, it's over. And he's not even showboating.\n\n\nIt's anyone's game.\n\n\nIt's the greatest couch game in history.\n\nwakwakwak","February 5","true","120.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is really good for playing with your friends and having a good time. I also like the music and graphics of the game. Every item in the game is very unique too. This is literally one of the best games i've played yet and I highly recommend this game for people who want to try something new and exciting. The quack is the best feature in the game. 10/10\n\nDuck Translation:\nQauck quack quack quack quack. Quack quack quack quack, Qauck Quack Quack. Quack quack quack quack quack Qauck Quack.

It has online play, but also works just fine locally (if you have enough controllers at hand). I played it a lot after buying it, and it's kept a solid place since as a go-to party game.\n\nIt has a nice retro soundtrack. Also a decent level variety, which is chosen from at random, so players need to make strategies during the couple of seconds before a match starts. Given the variety of interesting guns and accessories, players often have the opportunity to pit different strategies against each other.\n\nHighly recommended.\n","May 10","true","30.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You got a variety of aiming, racing, and even small missions where you have to pay quite some attention HOW you use the givin weaponry to complete them.\n\nMultiplayer is the real deal for Duck Game. Whether its offline, sittin next to each other and blow your ducks to feathers and roast, or online. The matchmaking is good and fast, suffers only from people with a high ping = the game starts lagging -> You had the gun on your screen, but suddenly the other duck shoots you with it. You can avoid that easily by checking the pings in lobby and dodge those guys.\nThe game has its own situation comedy and humor you cant help but laugh or at least, if you are really grumpy, smirk about. Thats a major part of the longtime motivation, i played up to this review 30 hours + and it wasnt boring a second. I gonna start soon building my own maps with the level editor, which is a bit fiddly but after a while you will get it.\n\nThe other major part is the gameplay. Dozens of different,  hillarious weapons are waitin for you to use them in every way you can imagine. Burning nerf-blaster, slippery bananas into motion-sensored mines, minigun-jetpack-combos and way more. Over all: The absolute direct, snappy and handy controlling (i recommend a controller, not the keyboard), just the right tool to perform something like jumping of a high edge and sniping a duck halfway across the map through a door, mid-air of course.\n\nStill not convinced? There is an extra button for quacking (with a controller you can even pitch your quacks) AND ----- Hats. A s***load of hats. Trust me, its worth the money!\n\nThats it for me. So, see you online, let the better one moonwalk and quack at the end!","July 13, 2015","true","45.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hi7ch/recommended/312530/","Hi7ch","Hitch","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Hi7ch/","307 products in account","For 2-player Local gameplay see here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qiQ-KB0w-FM\n\nThe first reaction to seeing Duck Game in action tends to be a prolonged “WTF!?”. The second reaction is equally as entertaining. Once the shock settles, a near permanent smile sets on your face and the faces of those watching and you can hear genuine excitement in those whoops and shouts of delight as you annihilate your opponents to the oh so sweet quack, quack, quacking of the winner. I am not going to beat about the bush here. This game is silly. This game is fun. This game could very easily be THE multiplayer video-game of 2015.\n\nReleased previously on what many consider the now defunct Ouya, Duck Game hits windows Steam harder than Donald Duck does English. Featuring a 2 and 4 player local couch co-op, single player challenge modes and for this new release a 2 to 4 player online battle also. With over 50 pre-built levels and over 50 weapons of various hilarity inducing carnage plus a built in level creator the game offers much to keep the gamer interested. It doesn’t really matter though as this game is so much fun to play you never really get fed up of a set level.\n\nIt plays fast and furious, slick and silly, and whilst the gameplay may not venture above running around a 2D platform, picking up weapons, throwing grenades and causing general mayhem, it perfects the genre. It looks fantastic with its ‘old skool’ retro-gaming feel and sounds like you are back in those 80s arcades that many of us grew up with and many others wish they had too.\n\nThis is Indie gaming done proper. A small idea turned on edgeways, a dash of laughter, perfect controls and fluid gameplay. The Dev, Landon Podbielski will hopefully rake in the kind of money that would make Scrooge McDuck blush and it’s publishers, Adult Swim Games, should court Landon until he comes up with more of these gems. I really do have a hard time criticising this game but in an effort to come across as balanced and not an utter fanboy… No, sorry, I just cannot fault it. Sure, you can lose in the very first second but even then it is still fun to watch the ensuing slaughter. With practice those insta deaths tail away into memory and you find yourself being a little more cautious as you start thinking tactfully and stop running hell for leather over the edge. Running like a mad dog straight for your opponent with a live grenade that will take you both out though, well that never get’s old.\nDespite the obvious violence at play here the whole thing is one big cartoon of jetpacking Ducks and because of this some of you may wish to try the game yourself before assuming it will be ok for the younger generation, the only problem with this is that you are unlikely to want to give it back once you played it too. For those of you who take the plunge, you will not be disappointed. From the very first time you jump in the game, to the moment at the end where the mock sports commentator runs through a quick review of those special highlights and we see who was the most popular and therefore wins prizes, you will be hooked.\n\nOh yes, whilst having your fun, be sure to check out the party mode and stock up your favourite tipple. If you follow the party rules, one, and most likely all of you will end up extremely dizzy at the end of it all.\nBuy this game. Just buy the quacking thing!","June 4, 2015","true","39.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You got a variety of aiming, racing, and even small missions where you have to pay quite some attention HOW you use the givin weaponry to complete them.\n\nMultiplayer is the real deal for Duck Game. Whether its offline, sittin next to each other and blow your ducks to feathers and roast, or online. The matchmaking is good and fast, suffers only from people with a high ping = the game starts lagging -> You had the gun on your screen, but suddenly the other duck shoots you with it. You can avoid that easily by checking the pings in lobby and dodge those guys.\nThe game has its own situation comedy and humor you cant help but laugh or at least, if you are really grumpy, smirk about. Thats a major part of the longtime motivation, i played up to this review 30 hours + and it wasnt boring a second. I gonna start soon building my own maps with the level editor, which is a bit fiddly but after a while you will get it.\n\nThe other major part is the gameplay. Dozens of different,  hillarious weapons are waitin for you to use them in every way you can imagine. Burning nerf-blaster, slippery bananas into motion-sensored mines, minigun-jetpack-combos and way more. Over all: The absolute direct, snappy and handy controlling (i recommend a controller, not the keyboard), just the right tool to perform something like jumping of a high edge and sniping a duck halfway across the map through a door, mid-air of course.\n\nStill not convinced? There is an extra button for quacking (with a controller you can even pitch your quacks) AND ----- Hats. A s***load of hats. Trust me, its worth the money!\n\nThats it for me. So, see you online, let the better one moonwalk and quack at the end!","July 13, 2015","true","45.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Grab a weapon and use it! This may not sound special, but I can promise you: A lot of buIIsh!t happened in the fights and that's what this game makes so good in my opinion. A nice variety of weapons and tools are enough to create chaotic and ridiculous skirmishes. The fights are short, so you don't have to wait for long in case you die. The stages are chosen randomly and if that's not enough, you can download custom maps from the workshop  and add something new. Singleplayer is a simple trial of challenges.\nThe only sh!tfactor is the ragequitting or disconnecting from players.

Grab a weapon and use it! This may not sound special, but I can promise you: A lot of buIIsh!t happened in the fights and that's what this game makes so good in my opinion. A nice variety of weapons and tools are enough to create chaotic and ridiculous skirmishes. The fights are short, so you don't have to wait for long in case you die. The stages are chosen randomly and if that's not enough, you can download custom maps from the workshop  and add something new. Singleplayer is a simple trial of challenges.\nThe only sh!tfactor is the ragequitting or disconnecting from players.  High ping makes the matches unplayable, but the community is nice and fair overall. You will have a great experience when playing this with 3 other friends, that's for sure!","August 19, 2015","true","29.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"
