Their intent was to make a couple ♥♥♥♥ simulators and that's exactly what they did. Any publicity, is good publicity right? Not really, but good job. As far as the games go, it's open and shut. They are pure garbage, Controls are terrible, UI was done by a 12-year-old. The city or "New York" is clearly European. Same goes for the cars/assets and the THUMBNAIL doesn't even match you GAME NAME! Don't just take my word for it, give it a watch.

Especially not worth $5. No money system, just a level system, and the "reviews" customers give you when you get them to their destination seems random. I delivered a passenger safely and they asked if I got my license in a box of cereal. Irritated, I took another fare and did everything I could to break my car. No damage physics, and the customer told me (after over a dozen collisions) that I was a taxi driving pro. Thanks for stroking my ego.","March 13","false","0.1"," 42 of 44 people (95%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","95","42","44","15","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/recommended/446470/","astring","every bae is halloween","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/","4250 products in account","New York Taxi Simulator takes place in a world that does not resemble New York in the slightest, where nothing is simulated because there are no penalties, collision does not exist on all objects, vehicles suffer no ill effect for slamming into one another, or buildings, or anything which is solid, and to top it all off, there's a weird effect where a siren is baked into the music randomly that made me think my lone taxi fare of carnage was going to attract a penalty. It didn't.\n\nI got a customer to his destination with 40 seconds to spare after driving the wrong way down identical* streets for about 3 minutes, sometimes on the sidewalk, sometimes through pedestrians (of whom I saw a total of TWO, and aimed for to see what happened - they are ghosts is what), and was told that I was a 4/5 star driver, and very professional. I drove him to his stop like this game is 4/5 stars: only in its fever-dream world.\n\n* If you told me this game's streets were procedurally generated, I'd believe you.","May 30","false","0.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Can't change the graphics resolution, the 3D engine is very rudimentary and has severe texture artifacts. The handling is terrible, which has a lot to do with the fact that the controls are limited to the keyboard. You're always making a hard turn, flooring it, and braking hard.\n\nNew York City in no shape or form. The block layouts are not modeled on the actual street layout, the buildings aren't tall enough, and there are certainly not enough pedestrians or traffic lights, even if it were modeled on less dense areas of NYC like Ozone Park. It's "NYC" because it's all on a perfect 90-degree angled grid which is basically Midtown only. It also makes no sense that there's a literal red wall marking the boundaries. Manhattan is an island; they could have simply closed off approaches to bridges and tunnels.\n\nYou could forgive that and the graphics and other things, but with the poor controls it's completely unenjoyable. It is, in fact, unfairly frustrating.","April 19","false","0.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

You just stop. Still better than Codemasters' F1 games physics but that's not enough;\nFIVE EURO?! I got this in a bundle with other 6 games for 1,99 and still feel robbed.Graphics are awesome though, if you're a time-traveller from the 1975.\nI don't even feel like "No" is the proper answer for the question: "Do you recommend this game?".\nThis "game" should not even exist in the first place.","April 23","false","0.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

My "hurry ups" always land a 5/5 star yelp rating usually involving the fact that I am a taxi master. Definitely going to be playing some more of this, especially due to the surreal aspects that make you think.\n\nOne early example is that instead of bringing people to their destination, the help list clearly states that you are bringing people to their destiny. Which is probably the most accurate representation of New York City Taxi driving that I've ever seen.\n\nLooking forward to more from this great dev studio :D\n\nP.S. I'm so jealous that I didn't get to be a part of testing this. They had so many testers! 2!!! Both were also on the game/level design team... a little suspicious if you ask me lol *wink*","April 26","true","1.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","3","6","3","8"
