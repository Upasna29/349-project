You're never in real danger: the enemies are in the cutscenes and can never harm you in the gameplay. The only time I almost felt threaten was when the steam hit my character, but I'm not even sure that did anything but put blood on my screen. Tom (the main character) just walks it off, much like the radiation poisoning. Yeah.\n\nIn the demos, you could find weapons to use. A whole action scene that showed off the combat was scrapped (I remember the area having a shotgun and a little skirmish right after). I'm not saying that the lack of guns means it's no fun; I mean there no variety in the gameplay. (For example, something like using the shotgun to blast open a door, only for the loud noise to attract the weird radiated rock-spiders that, even with a weapon, the player has little chance of winning a confrontation with it. The door, of course, would've been openable by something else, but the shotgun would've provided the easiest way to opening it.)\n\nIt could've been nice to use the environment in any way (outside of picking up boxes and setting them back down—gently) outside of just looking at pretty objects. Everything is bolted to the ground; you can only push, pull, squeeze through and vault up/over things when the game tells you that you can, and once you do, there's no going back for reasons.\n\nAll of the puzzles can be solved in seconds; they're rarely above "door needs key; find the key in other room; open door." There is only ever one path to go on, and the only ever branching path leads to the key/steel pipe/hand wheel/whatever you need to use to open a door.\n\nThis game is going to be perfect for the click bait LP'er crowd; things just happen to our character in loud, blaring noises to only cut to...more hallways to walk into triggers.\n\nThe spiders look ridiculously low poly. Everything in the game is stock assets from CryEngine (even the main character who sometimes has a beard and sometimes not). The camera likes to wiggle around and stick to shots of the stock animals from the original engine when it tries to be "cinematic" or "epic."\n\nThis is a very nice looking but boring game. Pretty much everything in it comes with CryEngine (and you can blatantly tell the custom assets right away).\n\nThe game runs very smoothly.","June 2","false","3.4"," 27 of 41 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","27","41","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gh0stG3/recommended/482300/","Gh0stG3","Quizzle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Gh0stG3/","40 products in account","Gameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOvUIEgI4fE&feature=youtu.be\n\nInvestigator is a Russian atmospheric adventure game set in the year 2050 where the world is being ravaged by extreme weather conditions. The English subtitles are pretty good and aren't hard to understand. There are 10 "levels" in the game. You can choose to start the story in the middle if you so choose, these levels act as "anchored save points" as there are no actual save points in the game. The cinematography in this game is well done at some parts, notably the beginning of some levels and during interactions with certain objects.\n\nThe user plays as Tom, an ex-investigator with a troubled past roaming detailed environments attempting to find a safe haven from danger. The engagements and progression of the adventure are a mix of puzzle and high energy events, mix that in with some JASON(the one with the mask) and you have this game. As you progress through the game Tom's objective and story become clearer.\n\nI should probably mention, there are some horror elements in this game.. Especially if you have fear of spiders or are claustrophobic or have a fear of drowning. A couple of jumpscares too.\n\nThings I dislike about this game are that the puzzles/scavenging are a bit too easy/uninteresting, the game is quite short and the game uses anchored savepoints.\n\nInvestigator runs at 60 fps and isn't a laggy game by any means. It's using the CryEngine so if your graphics card can handle it, it's bootyful.\n\nAll-in-all so far I am having fun with the game and am facing my fear of spiders.","June 1","true","1.8"," 27 of 41 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","27","41","3","0"

Thats a great price for this game. There are 10 levels, I am currently on level 2 and I have played for just under an hour which includes me exploring everywhere in the area. It has Russian speech, however english subtitles are there and doesnt affect the gameplay at all. Sound quality is fantastic! Especially with headphones as you can all tne detail of the rain etc. Graphics are awesome as well because it is the Cry Engine. Got this game on release date (2nd June 2016) so far no problems with the game. Level 2 is quite spooky so far, and is really interesting and fun. You must try this game.","June 2","true","0.8"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","50","8","16","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ratm_rule/recommended/482300/","ratm_rule","ratm_rule","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ratm_rule/","881 products in account","This game was a dissapointment.\nFrom the trailer and description I expected something more than a walking simulator.\nThough it is a pretty game there isn't much else to it, just an average story of a guy searching for somewhere safe after the world's weather goes crazy.\nThere's one basic puzzle and a few jumpscares throughout.\nAlso some of the on screen prompts throughout the game were incorrect (press f to pick up a box was actually left mouse click).\nAltogether the game lasted just over two hours (I didn't rush, there was just nothing else to do)\nConsidering I paid £6.29 for this I would not reccomend it, instead if you want to grab it wait till it's a lot cheaper.\nFor now If you really want to play an apocalyptic horror game based in russia grab one of the Metro or STALKER games.\n\n","June 4","false","2.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Despite these things, I still very much enjoyed it. It's the epitome of indie horrow game, kind of spooky with decent graphics. It plays like a small movie. Would definitely recommend for people into indie games. Good for what it is.","June 4","true","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The atmosphere is quite nice, and the graphics and details in it are cool as well.
