One has been chosen as a human sacrifice to a monster that has been terrorising the local villages for generations, the other is alone on a deep-space exploration vessel. You, as the player, have to guide these two through their own stories of "escape".\n\nI found the story interesting, and then when the two characters briefly meet, then abruptly change places...\n\nOn to part two, and in a word: Disapointing.\n\nAfter months of waiting, we get this lacklustre, almost generic point-and-click game that relies more on player knowlege than imersion in the story. I got stuck on several puzzles, only to discover that the solution requires finding something AS THE OTHER CHARACTER, totally destroying any immersion that I may have still had, and dumping me into the mode of "player behind the keyboard" instead.\n\nAnd then, when the final solution required co-ordinating the actions of both characters at the same time, without either character even knowing what the other is doing, well, I guess that's the "Broken" part of Broken Age.\n\nWhile I would like to recomend this game based on the first part, I just can't. Sorry.","October 13, 2015","false","18.7"," 516 of 647 people (80%) found this review helpful 21 people found this review funny","80","516","647","21","8"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomedemon/recommended/232790/","nomedemon","[AReV]Nomed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nomedemon/","1050 products in account","After an overwhelmingly successful Kickstarter campaign, Tim Schafer and his team at Double Fine have decided to return to their roots with their first point-and-click adventure game in over 15 years. Similar to their past projects like Grim Fandango and The Secret of Monkey Island, Broken Age features unforgettable characters, puzzles, unique themes, and plenty of humor.\n\nThe game centers around two characters each from a drastically different walk of life. One half of the narrative follows Vella, a girl who is to be offered as a sacrifice to an enormous monster known as Mog Chothra. While the other half of the story focuses on a boy named Shay who finds himself trapped on a spaceship under the watchful eye of an overly protective computer that holds him prisoner under the pretense of safety. Both of the characters yearn for change and freedom in their own way. While Vella is surrounded by overly zealous villagers that cling to tradition, Shay is completely isolated and patronized by an overbearing computer as he’s forced to endure the same routine day after day.\n\nThe puzzles are quite satisfying, they’re not overly complex but they still require some thinking which is a refreshing change from most recent games in the genre. They consist of scouring the environment for various items which can be combined with one another or given to certain characters. The amount of overall polish added to the dialogue is impressive, as you’ll most likely try to use the items in your inventory in clever ways to prompt humorous reactions and responses.\n\nThe art style is unique and really sets the game apart. While not being overly impressive on a technical level, Broken Age is brimming with personality and has an undeniable charm. The game feels like a children’s book come to life but the underlying themes and subtle humor make it appealing to players of all ages. The environments are varied and interesting to look at while the characters are all quite memorable.\n\nSporting an all-star cast, the voice acting is top notch which brings each of the characters to life with standout performances from Elijah Wood as Shay and Jennifer Hale best known for her work on Mass Effect (Femshep) as the megalomaniacal computer. The soundtrack is also well done, fitting the mood and atmosphere of the game perfectly.\n\nUnfortunately, the game is quite linear and doesn’t really offer much in terms of re-playability. The different dialogue options add a bit of humor but have little to no impact on the story. For example: choosing to lie to certain characters won’t change the way they perceive you and will have the same effect as telling the truth.\n\nAct one is also fairly short, lasting around 4 hours and it ends with a bit of a cliffhanger which will leave you anxiously waiting for Act two. Broken Age probably would have benefited from being released all at once but Act two is promised at no additional cost at a later date.\n\nOverall, Broken Age is a charming game with a strong narrative, great humor and memorable characters. It’s proof that there is still room for creativity and innovation amidst the slew of modern action titles. Broken Age not only revives the point and click genre, it helps redefine it.\n\nTLDR? This review is also available in video format:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2kNp4HjhyQY\n\n\nPros:\n\n+ Strong Narrative\n+ Solid Voice Acting\n+ Great Sense of Humor\n+ Reasonable Puzzles\n+ Fantastic Art Direction\n+ Charming and Unique\n\n\nCons:\n\n- Cliffhanger Ending\n- Short Length (3 - 4 hours long)\n- Linear\n- Dialogue Options have little influence on the story.\n\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, feel free to follow me as a Steam Curator: http://store.steampowered.com/curator/4886473/","January 29, 2014","true","5.0"," 392 of 484 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","392","484","4","20"

There's a feeling of it having been rushed, and so many details you'd expect to have been finessed over the long wait for Act 2 are just glossed over.  Yes, the game is finally complete, but Act 1 was far better written in terms of story telling.  Having completed the game at long last, I'm sad to say I didn't enjoy Act 2 as much as I did Act 1, and to that point, the game is just...meh.  There's just no sense of accomplishment when all is over.\n\nIt really does seem like everything that was hyped up just falls apart at the end.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PalinFreeborn/recommended/232790/","PalinFreeborn","Palin Freeborn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PalinFreeborn/","512 products in account","Quick disclaimer for this review: I have 9.6 hours on record for this game, but the time played for the game is actually half of that (at around 5 hours), as I revisited the game to replay the first part and screw around for achievements, before giving up entirely. I've included some spoilers for the game under warning. Be aware of it if you don't want spoilers.\n\nHaving that said: It is now three years later. The Double Fine Adventure kickstarter asked for $400,000 to make this game and they were given $3.45 million to do it. Double Fine, rather than budgeting themselves to stay within that target, sold the first half of the game on Steam so they could raise money for the second half. They already had more money than they needed, but they still sold a half-finished game to bring in more funds, bringing up to around the $4 million mark. It also took them over a year to release the second installment of the game.\n\nBroken Age is like eating a beautiful, delicious cake, and finding out that Double Fine saved money on frosting by using leftover spackle. Then you have to watch Double Fine eating better, more edible cake, bought with your money.\n\n\nART:\nThe game itself is, admittedly, gorgeous. The art style and animations are very well done. The voice over talent, too, is pretty decent. I'm tired of hearing Wil Wheaton drone his way through video games, but Pendleton Ward and Jennifer Hale are welcome sounds for your ear-drums. That's where the general positivity ends.\n\nSTORY:\nThe story is abysmal. You play as two characters, Shay and Vella. Shay is trapped on a spaceship under a domineering, overly-loving computer named MOM, with basically no life. Vella is about to be sacrificed to the Lovecraftian "Mog Chothra" monster because "tradition." You control each character in turn, and can switch between either, but they're both sectioned off and unrelated adventures for the most part. In Act 1, the game does a pretty decent job of setting up mysteries: What is Mog Chothra? Who is Marek the Wolf? Why is the ship's computer, MOM, so seemingly hell-bent on imprisoning Shay? Who is the mysterious man in the DeadEye Mountain and how does he have technology like we see on Shay's ship? Why are we still pretending Wil Wheaton has a career in acting when he only ever plays himself with a beard?\n\nIn Act 2, these questions are swept under a rug quickly. Players are plied with half-hearted exposition, contrived answers, and massive plot holes that are never filled. Characters from the first game are given completely different rules and motivations than before, but offer no explanation for their behavior change. Shay is useless in the grand scheme of the game, and affects NOTHING of the outcome, when you get right down to it. Acts 1 and 2 favor Vella heavily as the "get ♥♥♥♥ done" protagonist and she gets most of the interesting story as a result. Getting into spoiler territory below.\n\n***SPOILERS***\n\nThe portrayal of the characters is severely infuriating, too. Shay is a poor protagonist, especially in light of Vella's achievements throughout the game. Shay affects almost nothing story-wise and, in some cases, actually causes problems for Vella as a result of his actions. He is infantilized, both by his overbearing mother and his reliance on child toys for assistance. At one point in Act 2, he is actually, literally replaced by a blow-up doll, while other characters comment on how useless he is. Vella, by contrast, is smart, capable, solves most of the game's big puzzles, directly fights the game's main enemies, and we are told explicitly that she is the most important character in the game because her blood is coveted by the enemies.\n\nThe enemies of Broken Age are introduced in the last hour of the game (if you complete Shay's half of Act 2 first) and they barely make an appearance until the last 15 minutes. They are cadaver-white, mutated humans, that have been using eugenics to "purify" themselves and they use the Mog Chothra ships to secure targets for eugenics testing or something. The game kind of skips over most of the exposition when it comes to their history, character, and motivations, confining it all to a single conversation with Vella before she fission bombs them back to the stone age.\n\nThe end result is that Shay is a useless boy, easily replaced, and isn't capable of resolving issues without his child toys. Vella is a strong black girl using death lasers and nuclear bombs to take on the (essentially) Aryan Establishment, who desperately want her blood so they can fix their failing genetic structure. The game ends when Vella melts both Mog Chothra ships together into a literal bridge between the "normal" world and the Plague Dam, offering no further information about what the characters do, or how the story ends.\n\n***SPOILERS***\n\nIf I wasn't so aware of Tim Schafer's personal politics, I'd almost assume it's unintentional, but it comes off as preachy, pretentious, and frustratingly lackluster.\n\nGAMEPLAY:\nThe place where this game truly, truly fails... is the game-play. That's a cardinal sin in gaming.\n\nSome of the puzzles for Broken Age are clever. They remind me of old-school gaming, where the solutions to problems generally involved the inventive use of a otherwise off-the-wall item to resolve issues. In the entirity of Broken Age, I'd say there's about a dozen examples of this and it works well for the game. The problem is the other several dozen puzzles, which are not intuitive, inventive, or explained. I'm going to save you all time right now and tell you that one of the puzzles in Act 2, regarding a Boa Constrictor, requires that you stop playing the game for three minutes and wait. The game does not tell you this and does not give an immediate or clear indication that the you should wait. It's not explained before this that the snake will get tired and fall off so you can collect him. It was only after getting frustrated and looking up what to do with the snake that I, and my friends, realized you had to stop playing the game for a few minutes to progress in it. Another cardinal sin.\n\nThe WORST PUZZLE IN THE GAME is a wiring puzzle, in which you have to rewire helper robots to perform different functions. This isn't easily explained, the instructions aren't listed in a spot that is easily accessed, and even then, they're not marked as instructions on how to fix up the robot. You have to perform this puzzle at least 5 TIMES, although that number skyrockets if you don't know what you're doing, and the answer is ALWAYS randomized, so you can't just look it up. Trying to figure out this rewiring puzzle easily took up over 45 minutes of my time before the game gave me a hint that the answer was somewhere in Vella's half of Act 2. It was another hour before I found the instructions and realized what they were for. The fact that I had to perform the rewiring puzzle another 4 times after this, for different robot "modes", was just lazy and not fun in the slightest.\n\nThe rest of the puzzles in the game either had really boring solutions (like raising/lowering the pH of a mixture, which was more time-consuming than difficult), or they were just run-of-the-mill item fetch quests for things that shouldn't be issues. Shay has a cupcake, at one point, with icing on it and you need to take the icing off, but Shay refuses to just take the icing off. Why the hell is this even an problem!?\n\nSUMMARY:\nThis is a gorgeous game beset by a lot of gameplay and story issues. Double Fine CLEARLY rushed through development on Act 2 and it shows. There are massive plotholes, the game has no real ending, and the puzzles they set up are lazy in Act 2. The fact that Tim Schafer says this game is a success and he plans to do another kickstarter is reason enough not to support this game, especially after the SpaceBase debacle.\n\nTL;DR:\nGame is pretty, but dumb and not fun at some parts. Save your money, buy a better adventure game.","April 29, 2015","false","9.6"," 670 of 895 people (75%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","75","670","895","26","25"

Granted most of his games weren't all that great as games - but they usually made up for that with a memorable cast, witty dialogue and great settings / stories. While Broken Age has some of that Schafer magic at times, it just doesn't feel like a whole package to me.\n\nThe "story" is hardly interesting and when you get to the great twist upon starting Act 2 there is nothing ever being built from there - in fact, the faction that gets briefly introduced is about the only thing I was interested in learning more about. And then the game ends it and they lived happily ever after. Calling the ending "abrupt" would be an understatement - it just stops without explaining anything or offering a satisfying conclusion. Act 2 also feels a lot like its "social commentary" was more important than anything else, because tonally it's different - particularly Vella's attitude changes somewhat and got on my nerves, while Shay overall just feels like filler from the get go.\n\nIt's a great looking game at times (when the low-res art isn't zoomed to a level where you can count every pixel) and sounds good, but I can't shake the feeling it was entirely pointless and like 75% filler-material. In fact, I believe an hour long animation could have achieved everything story-wise without being a mediocre adventure game. The way it is now, Broken Age suffers from terrible puzzles (again, Act 2 being really bad - like The Dig-levels of annoying, never wanting to rewire any robots any time soon), has a sucky save-system and controls that feel slightly off (perhaps because it is originally a tablet-game?).\n\nCan't even say I am disappointed because this game is so "whatever" - but won't recommend it either, try some Wadjet Eye stuff instead.","October 31, 2015","false","11.3"," 300 of 396 people (76%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","76","300","396","6","6"

In my opinion, the game gets significantly harder in such a way that I will most likely never replay it because of one specific puzzle. The 2nd chapter's storytelling feels lazy, and we never get to explore what could have been one of the most interesting areas, especially considering that the lead up to said city was something established since the beginning. Instead we briefly see it for about 3 seconds.\n\nThe second part overall felt rushed and lazy, it was so disappointing to wait 2 years for such a bland installment. Broken Age had such a large budget and loving crew that it is difficult to imagine how this happened, but ultimately it's just not good. Additionally, if you want any sort of closure, you have to watch the credits to get sketches of what happens after the end of the game. I'm not talking about extras either, there were drawings of what should have been integral parts of the ending.\n\nThe most frustrating thing is probably that our two protagonists still never get to speak to one another.","October 3, 2015","false","31.6"," 228 of 305 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","228","305","3","0"

Finally a quality adventure game. I can't really find anything negative about it except for it's length. I know there will a second part sometime in the future, but no one knows when. At least i hope it will be same as good as the act 1 which was amazing. But still i wouldn't pay the full price for it. This game was crowdfunded and got more than enough money, so they could've released the whole game.\nIt reminds me of those old adventure games. Beautiful environments and artstyle. Great voice acting and wonderful music follows you through the whole first act. You're carried away into that beautiful world and don't want to stop playing. And the story is top notch, you keep thinking how the two characters are connected and when you find out, it's amazing and keeps wanting to play act 2 as soon as possible.\n\nSadly the second act is not that good. No, it's really bad. After waiting for soooooo long i expected something more than backtracking to the same locations as in first act. Now you changed places, you are running back and forth in the spaceship with Vella this time and Shay is in the clouds. Same locations, new puzzles. Like the same locations is not enough, the puzzles became stupidly hard and it breaks the experience. All that running around in the same locations gets boring and you don't have a clue how to solve the puzzles. I don't want to play it anymore, i lost the interest because of the stupid puzzles. There's absolutely no logic behind them. You don't know what you supposed to do.\nI can't recommend this.

Avoided giving any spoilers).\n\nMan, I hate giving this game a negative review. I really wanted this ♥♥♥♥ to be awesome. I never really played adventure games before Broken Age's kickstarter happened, and the genre just seemed to explode in popularity.\n\nThe first Act of the game was great. Superb. Loved it. Interesting world, interesting puzzles that made me go DOH!, fun characters (even if they could be a bit one dimensional sometimes). The tone of the game was calm despite what drove the two main characters.\n\nThen Act II came out. And... eeeeeh.\n\nThe big chunk of Act II for both characters is a very long fetch quest. Or at least it feels that way. A very, very long segment that prevents the story from progressing. In Act II, each puzzle pushed me closer to the next grand environment. In Act I, I was running around all the environments I'd already gone to, and it just wasn't as fun.\n\nBoth stories blow their big twists very quickly, which are ♥♥♥♥ing amazing. Problem is that I consider them the climax, as the game feels like it just wants to end after that, but feels like it needs to live up to what I hear are 'classic adventure game puzzles', which to me just felt obtuse and forced me to get hints online.\n\nEverything just began to feel rushed after the twists. Knowing Double Fine's budget problems behind the scenes, I understand why this is the case, but the game's still unsatisfying.\n\nI'm a bit bummed by the lack of Merek at the end. The conversations you get to have with him are awesome. But I wanted more of him. He's my favorite character in a cast of characters I really enjoyed (outside Vella's family, which I don't think got enough screen time to feel important like Shay's 'mom' and 'dad').\n\nSo when you get to the end, it feels like everything is on a timer and death is soon to come if you don't act NOW. I understand putting a timer on the game would pressure puzzle fans, and I don't want a timer. But I would have enjoyed if the characters seemed more stressed out. There is an entire gang of characters sitting around and doing nothing. I know they can't really do much, but they just seem grumpy or otherwise docile.\n\nThe ending is weak.

No, almost every one of the puzzles in Act 2, I thought: "Wow, that was stupid.

The puzzles are irritatingly convoluted and in no way advance the story, there are no new environments to speak of (only two or three new screens per character), and the ominously sinister undercurrent behind Operation Dandelion and the Maiden's Feast hinted at throughout Act 1 collapses into nothingness almost immediately. Shay and Vella learn nothing, they do not grow, and the entire backstory, the entire reason for the plot, is dumped in a few lines of dialogue in a completely missable conversation. At the risk of spoilers, we have the opportunity to infiltrate the enemy base and learn these things first hand for ourself, to engage the people beyond the plague dam and see how their society parallels that of Sugar Bunting/Meriloft/Shellmound, but that chance is missed, as we remain stranded on the Little Tykes space ship at the risk of... what? Rendering a new environment? Writing a few more characters?\n\nThis game was so profoundly disapointing, it's haunting me a full 24 hours after finishing it. I have so much respect for DF and Tim's work, even the things I'm not the target audience for (Hey, I even played Once Upon a Monster with some family and found the unique DF flavor charming and nostalgic). I'm not here to demand to know where all the money went (we know where it went, its not a mystery) or ask why it took so long (I'd be happy if it had taken longer to be honest. This felt like a rushed and unloved project.) But there are games made for the simple love of it, with a team of one or two people in their off hours from their day jobs, in RPG maker or similar programs that have significantly more depth than this. Money does not equal a good game. Without a solid story, Broken Age is...well. Broken.\n\nCONSIDER BUYING INSTEAD: Hatoful Boyfriend. NO WAIT come back, I'm serious! The original build of Hatoful Boyfriend was made with royalty-free music and stock graphic assets suplimented by photos taken by the creator herself and it still has a rich, unique cast of characters and tells the story of a truly chilling murder mystery. Its an emotional roller coaster disguised as an otome parody, and a perfect example of a great game made without a big budget.\n\nMaybe Broken Age could have been better if it had been forced to work with a humbler budget.

I am one of the many sentimental fools who like to believe that it is possible to recreate the overall experience of a DOTT or the later (fantastic!) GRIM FANDAGO in the mind of a mid 30's guy if you just have the right ingredients.\n\nAnd then Tim Schafer comes along, with an idea to good to be true. So, give the man some money! Release the kraken! Just let him create for god's sake. It was the easiest decision of my life. And so many people did the same thing. So the game was hilariously overfunded.\n\nToday I believe that the money killed it. If he'd just gotten the 400.000 he'd been asking for, he would have been forced to stick to established mechanics for adventure games (don't forget, that's what he wanted to do, a classic 2D Point and Click, a "Double Fine Adventure") and work out some funny puzzles. No milestone in gaming history but a nice and small project for the fans.\n\nSo, what is this "Broken Age"? It is an ambitious interactive animated movie. The word "game" is not part of that definition for a reason. The production value is high, it looks good (if you like the art design) and It certainly can be a real jewel for a new generation of gamers, let's say the 12-year olds of today. I was twelve when I played Schafer's early works and I didn’t complain about gameplay details, I just loved the experience. Broken Age however simply doesn't get to me.\n\nHere the problem. Broken Age was not supposed to be a game for 12-year olds. It was supposed to be for the backers, for the old f***s! Hardly ever was a target group this precise and he obviously didn't even try to hit it. Tim Schafer knows how to make games for his generation. He proved it over and over.\n\nSo, what's wrong with Broken Age?\n\n1) It's not a game.\n\nSome say it's too easy, I'd say it's not even a game by definition. After the first 20 minutes I wondered why they bothered implementing an interface at all. For the way the story unravels a movie would have been the appropriate medium.\n\n2) Marketing was a strong design factor.\n\nNo one can blame Schafer for having sales in mind. He is a businessman after all. But this game should have been an exception for it was fully funded. The overall appeal of the game is that of an IOS or Android port. Versatile mouse controls are missing in favour of multi platform marketing.\n\n3) The dramaturgy doesn't work (Small Spoiler?!)\n\nTim Schafer is usually good at building tension and relieving it. He makes you empathise with the characters. Broken Age has a serious timing and immersion problem. After about 10 minutes of gameplay your character has to fight for her life but it doesn't stress you at all. It's like it doesn't matter and the other characters don't care much either. Given the actual drama of the scene it happens way too early and the story is not building up to it. It is a feeling of alienation that is highly unusual for Schafer's work.\n\nIf I didn't know anything about the background of "Broken Age" or who made it, I'd say: "Well, this is an interesting indie debut! Let's see what the guys can do when the come into some money!" But as a result of the most anticipated Kickstarter gaming project from a designer legend like Tim Schafer, it is an utter disappointment.\n","January 17, 2014","false","2.1"," 431 of 656 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","431","656","0","16"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jawajoey/recommended/232790/","Jawajoey","Jawajoey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jawajoey/","196 products in account","Updated Review for Act 2 (Original  review is below. Some things will be repeated. No spoilers for either Act 1 or 2):\n\nTLDR: It's not bad, but it's disappointing. The story loses it's attraction as the game goes on, and the puzzles get more tedious to solve. The writing, the art, and the world are good enough that I wouldn't want to prevent anyone from experiencing them, but the story and the puzzles just don't come together well enough for this game to be worth recommending. It's almost good enough, but the bottom line is that even if you go in with no expectations, you'll be disappointed by the time you finish.\n\nStory: The flaw in the story is how discordant it is. The strength of the first act was the discovery of the world these characters live in, and the troubling mystery behind it. But the second part, instead of continuing down that path, abandons those mysteries in favor of new, less interesting mysteries, that don't get the time to go through a fulfilling arc. You just get talked at about them, and don't get to explore any of it. And there are many, many points where the only reasonable thing for characters to do is have a thorough conversation about what they know, but it just isn't an option, for no narrative reason. In fact, there are many points where everything we know about the characters indicates that they should be reacting completely differently than they do. Worst of all, there are "revelations" that are so jarring that they can only be considered mid-story retcons, that just kind of slide by without comment.\n\nPuzzles: Very few puzzles made me feel clever or accomplished. Very few puzzles were seriously illogical (as far as adventure games go). Quite a few more puzzles, while not totally illogical, required experimentation that was tedious to execute (like traversing many screens just to test out a theory that might eventually lead you to the solution). The game frequently presents you with clear lists of goals you can work to achieve in parallel (which is a good thing in adventure games, IMO). But just as frequently, it turns out that one of those goals is completely unachievable until you've completed one of the other tasks (with no indiciation that that might be the case), which means that they're not at all parellel, and all the time you spent trying to progress down one path was a complete waste. This is a huge adventure game design sin, and it's employed here as a standard recurring design element.\n\n\nThere's something else that deserves special mention, for being a sin in both the narrative and the game design. There are multiple puzzles in the game that require the player to exploit their omniscience of boths sides of the story. Information that *cannot* be known by the characters is necessary to solve certain puzzles, and the game is designed around this. You'd be forgiven for hoping that this might lead to some interesting twist that makes it make narrative sense, but it's a stunt that is pulled straight-faced and without apology.\n\nHumor: There are some funny bits, but this isn't a comedy game. If you're seeking calssic Tim Schafer humor, you'll be mostly disappointed. Humorous dialog keeps the tone light, but the subject matter and the characters aren't really comic in nature, so the game can't avoid being generally mellow with a few laughs. There was only one moment that stood out to me as truly hilarious.\n\nVisual / Audio Design: Top notch. The characters, environments, animations and virtually all the voices are amazingly well done, with their own unique style.\n\nOverall: I know I'm sounding hard on it, but it isn't a bad game. I was actually on the fence of giving it a positive recommendation. But it just doesn't hold together well enough. The flaws that hurt the game the most are all clearly deliberate (rather than being a failure to achieve goals), and that's frankly inexcusable for a game with this pedigree.\n\nOriginal Review of Act 1 Alone (Not Recommended):\n\nI recommend the game if you're either totally in it for the story, OR if you're academically interested in the genre. It will be interesting to see where Broken Age lies in the history of adventure games and interactive storytelling.\n\nBut overall, the game itself is actually kind of hit and miss. I'd have to wait to see if the second half really ties it together before giving it a solid general recommendation.\n\nThe puzzles are...whatever. Nothing stood out as particularly clever or interesting. I think part of the problem was that problem space to work with was always so small that matching puzzles to their solutions was straightforward. It was very linear for an adventure game. The dual-story thing was an interesting idea, mechanically, because it lets the player progress along different lines if they're feeling stuck on something. However, that idea was kind of wasted on a game as "narrow" as this.\n\nSpeaking of the story, thumbs up. It's interesting and pretty unique, and maintains a feel of wonder and mystery, as you try to piece everything together. The dual-story contributed to that a lot. The world was filled with neat characters; by that I mean they weren't particularly likeable or memorable, but they were distinct and well conveyed. There's a lot in the world that I'm still curious about, but I feel like this is one of those things where if the payoff in the conclusion isn't good, it'll just spoil everything up to that point.\n\nThe game isn't funny. It's humorous, sure. The characters have a sense of humor, and there are jokes, and it doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's not a comedy, which is disappointing for a project funded on the dream of classic Tim Schafer adventure games.\n\nThe art is downright stunning. It's amazing how well the visuals, the animation, and the sound blend seamlessly into such a cohesive style.","October 19, 2014","false","14.8"," 348 of 528 people (66%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","66","348","528","3","5"

First an important note about myself, I´m a 27 years old art director specialized in animation, I work for the game and advertising industry. So, I probably suffer a little because of this during gameplay; it´s hard to fool someone that knows where all the strings ussually hide. Also, english is my third language. Beware.\n\nI honestly think that Tim got all wrong here, out of good intentions, but wrong indeed. I dont think he jumped the shark (I enjoyed VGAS mini adventure a lot) but the lack of focus and strategic management is intriguing. Tim has no problem seeing all that´s wrong about publishers and their intrussions in the creative process, but he clearly doesnt see that his workflow kind of depends on them. Running out of money in a proyect is not something to become used to. Specially when you propose a semi-open comunication platform.\n\nDoubleFine invested in this game more than they should. For me, this was the first intrussion into the kickstarter work dynamic. For them, its a "make or brake" project. Why? Dunno. Maybe their finances justify such a bold move, but that desition made the backers accesory. The fact that they depend on a larger sample to justify the investment, leaves us out of the picture. We paid for a game, and on the run they decided to make another one. Tim presents it as a "bigger game" but to be fair, that´s not a precise term. Broken Age turned out to be wider, not bigger.\n\nDont get me wrong, it´s probably the right move, with PC sales declining and tablets sales trough the roof, priorizing the casual tablet gamer represents a bigger target audience. But, it cant be denied, they used our money to make a game for other people. People that probably dont even know about the kickstarter campaing.\n\nI made a list of Tim mistakes, since I think the team really warned him about everything im goint to point out:\n\n1) Not having a game idea ready before the kickstarter or changing it on the fly due to budget increase. This is clear from the documentary, over 2 months of the guy writing alone and delaying both the art, animation and programming team. The proof behind this is the fact they ended up using test levels and characters in game. They didnt had the time to turn their backs to that amount of work.\n\n2) Not hiring a 2nd writer so he can do what he does best, direct the damn thing. This is derivatory from point 1. It´s clear how Tims writing hurt the game. He was behind on the game concept, behind on the game name, behind on dialog. Animating without dialog is frustrasting, as most of the work ends up being redone or retouched. You can move ahead, but you have to pretty much do it all over a again ( or at least supervise it ) so theres little time saved. Tim clearly delayed production time, and even worse, couldnt concentrate in writing ( his words ) due to "interruptions".\n\n2) Not listening to the community manager, that was the only one with the gut to tell the guy what everyone was thinking. The idea was too big for the budget. And at the end we got a small game that feels empty.\n\n3) Making Bagel a human chokepoint. This was ( since it´s my area of expertise ) the most intriguin desition of all and i know it really hurt the game. I'm a Bagel fan, but the idea of a game with his style and his style only, is flawed, because the guy only has 2 hands. Not only this, Bagel is more of an artist than a game art director nowadays. The art team suffered this desition; Bagel, because of the work load and responsability towards composition in a bigger scope, and the rest of the team for being subdued to someone elses stlye. This shows in the current version of the game. The contrast between scene and scene its hard to swallow, I personally can tell who draw each background.\n\n5) Changing the scope of the game "because he cant think of a smaller game" and then make it smaller due to budget constrains. The amount of concept art developed for this game is morbid, mostly when you consider how little we got to see implemented. All those hours of work could be better spent in many other areas that clearly needed of polishing.\n\n6) Priorizing art over gameplay. Now we get to the rough part. Yes, the game can be funny, but sincerely it isn´t really fun. Shay´s portion of the game altough conceptual feels empty and streamlined. I didnt break free, they gave me the perfect tool for every single puzzle, because of reasons. I solved the teleporter puzzle even before knowing why i should solve it, i saw it coming from the distance.\n\n7) Being OK with exploiting employees. This really got my gears going, since it's something that I suffer myself. Tim made a big game, because his a big boy that only knows how to make big games, and because of that, art directors, illustrators and animators, had to work overtime, because his damn schedule DOESNT MAKE SENSE. His words. I was OK with it ( I work overtime due to passion, not explotation ) untill I hear it from the man itself, he made a game that REQUIRED fathers to spend time away from their children. That's wrong, it doesnt matter how you present it.\n\n8) Forgetting that implementing audio and doing animation tests takes a lot of time. This is linked to point 2. Dialog really delayed everything. Without lines you cant record them, without the records you cant take your time to carefully choose the best takes, and then tie them to animation that actually makes sense with the tone and cadence of the voice. So little time to polish shows. At least for me, this was a deal breaker. The quality of the game it´s so sporadic that the beautiful made the ugly look more ugly.\n\n9) Leaving the sound team alone. Yup, this one is hard to write, since it´s clear in the documentary how much passion went in to the game. But, the voice takes they endedup choosing are baffling, many dont fit the tone, and in many cases, not only does the voice acting missfit the emotion of the dialog but the animation also does so, so we really see it. Watching a character moving his arms and opening his mouth like he's screaming, only to hear a calm voice whisper to my ears is baffling. I re-watched the voice acting episodes, and saw many takes much clear in intention than the ones they ended up using ( example, bellas "screw you bird" was off, really off ).\n\nThe score has moments of greatness, I must be sincere. But often, the disconnection, the lack of time to adjust things is palpable. What use is a director if he doesn't have access to his most powerful tool, saying "No, you got it wrong, do it again.".\n\n10) Playtesting and making a simple game simpler, because you forgot what adventure games are all about. If you test a puzzle game, and fear that your user is going to get stuck, then you really dont understand how adventure games work. Chokepoints, are most necesary, they build up tension, that is released, and that´s what you call satisfaction. Play "The Dig" if you forgot how that feels. The fact that the internet is a thing, is even more of an incentive for such dynamic. If you get really stuck and feel really ♥♥♥♥♥♥ about it, you dont have to buy a magazine to move forward.\n\n11) Backwards rationalization. Tim did this so many times that I lost count. It goes like this: Tim: "I WANT A". Reality: "You can only get B" Tim: "Now that I think about it, B is much better because..." It´s hard to make a game specially when you keep moving the target over and over again. When Tim said "part 2 has to be much harder" he really meant that part1 should be much harder but he couldn´t do anything about it.\n\n12) Forgeting to make smart production choices. Tim grew fond of shotting himself in the foot. I wouldnt be so harsh if it werent for a single game: "Swords and Sworcery". Made with little over 200,000$ in less than 8 months, the game is a great example of smart and creative choices, that fit a low budget perfectly.","January 20, 2014","false","8.0"," 272 of 414 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","272","414","0","11"

The game really has a picture book for kids vibe that continues through the entire game. If you can stand it, the graphics are pretty, and the animations are smooth. I thought the game was over all pretty, but it's up to your taste if you can stand it.\n\nThe voices are also well done. All character have well sounding voices, and what little dialogue there is is mostly well written, and some characters are memorable and likable. What little plot there is is interesting, and in the end I must concede that Double Fine managed to create an interesting world I would like to return to in what will hopefully be a Broken Age 2.\n\nAll that said, why is this a negative review? Well, the game has very little content when it comes to gameplay.\nOver all there are very few objects you can carry around, and mostly it is fairly obvious what they are supposed to be used for. This means that the item based puzzles are trivial to solve.\n\nAct 1 mostly consists of moving around in the cloud kingdom and a fishing village for Vella, and a space ship for Shay. The puzzles are mostly embarassingly easy fetch quests, and to be fair, act 1 might make a good introduction to adventure games for a young child. Act 1 ends with a plot twist I enjoyed, and after it I was looking forward to the meat of the game that I thought would be act 2.\n\nAct 2 mostly consists of moving around in the cloud kingdom and fishing village as Shay, and a space ship for Vella.\nThe puzzles are still mostly embarassingly easy fetch quests, there are a few mildly tricky puzzles, and then there are a few puzzles that are just a big slap in the face where the solution is only obvious after you have solved it, or only available to the other character as something they might comment on or see in the background.\n\nThe end game mostly centers around wiring up robots with patterns only the other character can find, and the ending really didn't feel very satisfactory to me, but it does leave room for a sequel which I hope we will get to see.\n\nThe main problem with act 2 is that it doesn't really expand on act 1. The characters are still stuck in the same small world with only a few items and the same characters as in act 1 available to them to use at any time, and ultimately that leaves the puzzles no more interesting than the ones in the introduction that is act 1. Ultimately I have to ask: What took so long? After years of development I was expecting a lot more gameplay content than this.\n\nBroken age is not a bad game, but it is not a very good one either.

The first act WAS too easy, but act two has some puzzles based on random seeds and a completely unintuative design. That's when the logic behind them doesn't mirror the leaps in logic found in Sierra's old point and click adventures, they're completely bizarre to the point of frustration.\n\nIf you really must play this, do not pay full price, it will not last you more than 6 hours and lacks any replay value with the characters being mostly uninteresting on the whole. (Barring Vella, who was at least pretty well done) I may not have backed this, but I wanted it to be good. Seems I made the right decision in not doing so, I would be far more upset.","May 2, 2015","false","7.0"," 69 of 95 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","69","95","0","0"

The 2nd half was dragged out by really un-intuitive puzzles that seemed only to exist because people compained how easy Part 1 was. The solution they had was to require some rediculous trial and error and puzzles that had their solutions hidden in the other persons section of the game.   sometimes the thing you needed to interact with really required almost no logical sense at all and had almost zero evidence pointing towards it that I can tell. I suppose this is true to old point and click adventure games, but that kind of logic probably was best left in the ancient era of Sierra games.\n\nTo re-interate how messy and nonsense the puzzles are in this game at one point you have to put a character in danger with very little hint that this is a thing you need to do. You have to do it for a while and even the character starts to discourage you towards the end, saying its time to stop. But if you stop you don't solve the puzzle, so you have to ignore common sense and everything the world and characters are telling you.\n\nThe characters constantly have to rely on knowledge they don't have and brush it off as "instict" that they figured it out after you found teh answer in the other persons story line. Sometimes you even have to do things that are presented as counter productive or perhaps make no real sense to do other than that you, as the player, are aware it needs to be done. And I don't mean stand on a pressure plate or pull a leaver. For a fictional example pretend a character of yours needs to stick a fork in a light socket to knock out the power. They as a character don't know hey need to do this. you as a player know that it will unlock a door down the block, but the character in this fictional example  just sticks the fork in there and knocks themself out in the process 'because reasons'. They have no reason to want to do it, and its presented as being detrimental, but you know better. Maybe.\n\nThe truth is there isn't much to this game. It has some funny dialog but even that is in short supply, if you were hoping for Tim Schafer's prime material then this isn't it. Plotwise it's a mess. At one point a character actually brushes off a major plot relevation as "oh yeah, I think i knew that but I kinda forgot" They have to have forgotten for it to work out as a big reveal to you, but then it's immediately deflated by the presenting it as your character just being that dumb they somehow forgot about this.\n\nThe game being made in two parts will also be quite obvious as it is a glarring jagged scar in terms of gameplay. You will breeze through the first half, then have the second driving you crazy. The final puzzle in the game requires you to do everything perfectly or it all resets back even further than it needed too, and in reality there is no reason it needed to reset at all other than to pad out the game time.\n\nAs for the ending, with no spoilers, this game has no real ending. It just kind of stops. You solve an annoying puzzle, there is a cutscene which tries to be epic but in the end it just does.. nothing. You accomplish nothing, you resolve nothing, you get no reward, no explination, and no resolution. It just ends. It might as well just pop a link to another kickstarter page saying "Yeah we ran out of money again, plz donate" Because honestly it feels like they burned through their cash and decided they had to just end it there. NO ENDING FOR YOU.\n\nAll in all if you already owned the first half, well you have the game already, if you were waiting for both halves to come out before buying, I can't recommend it.","April 29, 2015","false","7.2"," 157 of 243 people (65%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","65","157","243","3","0"

And after all this time he finally gives us the completed Broken Age, which is a mess and one of the worst games this acclaimed studio has produced.\n\nI've spent a whole day revisiting Broken Age, replaying Part 1 and playing Part 2, as per Mr. Schafer's advice. And that actually made the experience far worse because it made it all the more apparent how cheap this game feels. There's only three (well more like two and a half) locations you'll spend the majority of time exploring in this game, and man does it get boring. This game is supposed to rekindle the love of the LucasArts Adventure games but you aren't exploring a large and varied game world, you're just walking back and forth between the same backdrops OVER AND OVER AGAIN.\n\nAnd it's not like the artwork does anything to alleviate this, the art as you can tell is awful, it belongs in a cheap kids book that Scholastic would produce.  It's not as interesting as the worlds the player explores in prior DoubleFine games or Lucasarts game. And the animation is absolutely barebones, the game is not nearly as fun to look at in motion as the Monkey Islands or Day of the Tentacle was. To be frank I feel like a loser playing this game, as the artstyle is so amatuer and childish I'm truly embarrassed to see it on my computer screen. I'd rather have friends catch me playing Hyperdimension Neptunia than Broken Age.\n\nThis would all be forgivable if yes this game were not for my demographic, as a man in my 20s I obviously understand that everything isn't made for me and Broken Age looks perfect for young children. But I would never suggest this game for children because it's not at all designed for novice or easily distracted players. There is no option for a "Goal" system to remind you what you're looking for or hints, if you forget what it is you're after in the game you just end up wandering around the environment till you find the right NPC. So yes in some ways Doublefine did indeed make an Old School Adventure game, while I can't speak for everyone this isn't what I loved Adventure Games for. I loved them because they felt like semi-interactive cartoons, with puzzles that made me scratch my head and then feel smart for solving them. Broken Age Puzzles are either ridiculously easy or ridiculously obtuse with no middle ground.\n\nThe amount of activity is also extremely low in Broken Age. Any of those old Lucasarts games allowed you to click around the environments and your character would say a funny little line, there's only a items in Broken Age that have the characters say anything out loud and it's usually just them stating the obvious with no fanfare. You don't even get a fun line by trying to use the inventory in ways you obviously shouldn't, for an example the character Vella doesn't react negatively to you suggesting you use a knife on her little sister.\n\nThe only compliment I can pay Broken Age is that the audio is nice. Tim clearly used a large portion of his 3.3 Million budget to rub elbows with celebrities and hang out with an Orchestra. As if the players really cared if the actor who played Frodo Baggins is the star of the game.\n\nDo not buy this game for $20, hell I'd have a hard time saying it's worth $10. This is mediocrity and not even one that has lovable quirks. Doublefine put so little effort into it that I'm upset at how much time I've spent playing it. I only feel compelled to complete it because I gave them so much money in the Kickstarter.\n\nShame on you Doublefine and Tim Schafer, you went directly to the gaming enthusiasts and we might not give the cash a big publisher can provide but we allowed you full control on this project. And you squandered it on something completely unmemorable and spent most of that time partying and filming a self-fellating documentary.\n\nGood luck ever trying to make a Kickstarter as popular as this first one was. Because I sure as hell am not pledging again and I doubt I'm an anomaly.\n\nBefore you buy this game I urge you to play through all the Lucasarts and Telltale Adventure games, after that play everything else Doublefine made. Trust me they are all better games.","April 28, 2015","false","8.4"," 216 of 350 people (62%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","62","216","350","2","5"

So is the game actually good? After playing the entire first act in one sitting, the short answer is yes. Is it 3.3 million dollars good? I'd say no.\n\nThe game really shines when it comes to the world that Tim Schafer envisioned. I never felt bored exploring the world of Broken Age. There was always something interesting to see and marvel at. The story is really well done too and I really like how the first act ends and sets the events for the second act. I didn't see the story twist coming even though there were a lot of cleverly hidden clues which is a sign of good story writing. The dialogue is also very well written and as expected from a Tim Schafer game, very funny. I can see the same game being made at a much lower budget though. Voice acting probably cost them more than it should because there are some big names in there like Jack Black and Elijah Wood, but they could have done without them easily as their voice acting doesn't really add much to the game in my opinion.\n\nGameplay in Broken Age is your standard point and click adventure game fair. There is nothing revolutionary here that will change the genre forever or anything and I don't think Double Fine had plans to do that anyway. Most of the puzzles are on the easy side and there are enough clues to help you solve them quickly without feeling stuck for too long.\n\nOverall, I recommend Broken Age at a sale price. Maybe when it's $10 or less. It's not the best adventure game I've played, but it's worth playing nonetheless. Now the wait begins for the second act and the conclusion of the story.","January 15, 2014","true","9.5"," 239 of 391 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","239","391","4","37"

I really wanted to enjoy this game. When I first fired it up, I was expecting something along the lines of what I remembered from the later Lucas Arts games such as Grim Fandango and Monkey Island 3. What I got was a very small, very simple game, with some seriously lacking dialog, gameplay and design.\n\nThere really is a lack of gameplay across the board with this one. The whole first part of the boys sequence is on rails, and after that, the area he is in (the spaceship) is lacklustre at best with very little to do but explore the on-rails areas you were in at the start, which are very small boring areas with not a lot of stuff to interact with. In fact, there really are no areas in the game with a lot of interaction, nothing like the point and click games of the past or even the present.\n\nThe girls sequence is a little more open, but you are still put on a linear sequence of events which are always the same.\n\nThe NPCs in the world merely act as a tool to guide the player through the linear sequence of events, which is normally fine, but with NPC dialog being not a lot more than 5 or so questions directed at them about the world and a walk away line, it feels pretty dry and boring. Only a couple of characters are actually interesting throughout the experience. It just feels like the NPCs are waiting for the player to interact with them, instead of acting like real people with questions of their own, not to mention none of them ever move away from their original positions, as if they are glued to the world.\n\nNow onto the other important aspect of a good point and click adventure, the puzzles. They are so simple I didn’t actually have to think about them, with several of them solving themselves on their own. I remember the days when I used to spend a couple game sessions solving a specific puzzle, but this game really offers nothing that isn’t obvious. However, it might be a good starting point for a young child (even though I would suggest Spyfox or Freddie Fish over this any day).\n\nI am not one of those people who gets their kicks from art style so I will just say from what I saw it was pretty good. The music tracks however just weren’t memorable. Usually with games like these there are a couple music pieces which are memorable, but really, I can’t remember any of the music. Nothing like Stan’s themes from the Monkey Island series, or the awesome tracks from Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.\n\nTo finish I will just say this game is forgettable, and it is sad too. I was really hoping they would pull something incredible off which would bring back the genre with a bang, but this game isn’t going to do that for us. I really hope they aren’t going with the (swapping places) idea for part 2, I don’t care to see those old areas again, but heres hoping they make part 2 at least trickier with more interaction and more depthly dialog.","January 24, 2014","false","2.3"," 136 of 218 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","136","218","0","0"

I was one of the kickstarter backers and I had high hopes for this game but it falls flat.\nFirst let's start with the pros. This game looks beautiful. It looks like a storybook and it's also drawn in the Psychonauts style which looks very good. The game has great voice acting with actors like Jack Black and Elijah Wood. And finally the music sounds very nice and fit perfectly with the game.\nNow the cons. The game is very simple for an point-and-click adventure. Theirs is lack of options for how you deal with people and objects. In older point-and-click adventure games you would have options to look, interact, or take most objects but in the game all you can do is click on objects and if the character can take the object he/she will if they can't they will comment on it. It also got the lazy game mechanic where items disappear when it is used to solve a puzzle. The interaction between the player characters and NPCs are also very limited and when you solve their puzzle you can't even talk with them anymore. And talking about puzzles the puzzles of act 1 was OK but the puzzles for act 2 was terrible. The knot puzzle was by far the worse and their is little to no clue of how to solve it on your own. They also added dual puzzles for act 2 which makes no sense. For example to repair Shay's robot you will need Vella to see some symbols but that makes no sense as Shay and Vella have no way of communicating with each other. So Shay is just guessing the solution. But the biggest failure of this game is the story. For a point-and-click adventure game story is the most important feature. Act 1 started off with with many interesting plot threads but they either became plot-holes or has very little payoff in act 2. The ending for Broken Age is one of the most disappointing endings that I have ever encountered. Most of the important plot threads like dealing with the true villain are all done off screen!\nThis game feels very incomplete which is sad as I thought that $3,336,371 and 3 years of development would be enough to make great game but I was wrong.","May 1, 2015","false","28.5"," 93 of 145 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","93","145","2","5"

I can't really say much here that you won't find in other reviews. Clearly there are a lot of feelings about the politics of development that resonate through a lot of people's reviews here. I can't say I was really affected by that. But I can share some of my feelings about my experience of the game as a puzzle adventure, and that'll be that.\n\nI won't get into any details really but just say that Act 2 had certain puzzles that made me feel like I was having a joke played on me. Certain puzzles require a few steps to set up and when you get the final piece incorrect, everything unravels and you have to start over. That's to be expected in a videogame of course (I remember saving a game at a point in King's Quest 6 where I literally had to restart the entire adventure because I had missed an item along the way), and I'm no stranger to having my house of cards crash down around me.\n\nBut in this game I couldn't forgive the break of immersion that followed in those times, and that mostly had to do with the voiceovers and cutscenes. I really struggled with the choice to either 1) listen to the same phrases and watch the same cutscenes for the 5th or 6th time, or 2) skip quickly through the cutscenes and break myself out of the beautiful strange world I was in, while still being offput by the tedium that sometimes developed.\n\nI'll just end with this- I sort of wish they had never released Act 2, and instead of feeling disappointed with the complete project, I could have loved the world of Act 1 and agonized over how great Act 2 would have been if they had only been able to release it. So with a heavy heart I can't say I would recommend this game, but if you can get it half price just play Act 1 and revel in the blissful ignorance of the rest of the game.\n\n","May 5, 2015","false","12.0"," 38 of 54 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","38","54","0","0"

It has very high production values (take a look at that voice cast) and an interesting story for the most part. The art style is well done and consistent, and I didn't run into any bugs or issues while playing. The puzzles for the most part are about right in terms of difficulty.\n\nUnfortunately, this game does have a few major issues.\n\nMost point and click games have a button that highlights interactive elements on the screen. Not so with this game. Generally it's not an issue, but it is possible to get stuck simply because you didn't see you could interact with something.\n\nOn the topic of getting stuck, there's a string of randomized memory puzzles at the end of the game that are essentially a vertical wall in terms of difficulty. They require you to notice very subtle hints from the other story track to proceed, but the game provides no indication of this and you can get stuck for a long period of time. To top it off, some of these puzzles are timed and have a long cooldown before you can check the hints again (if you even know what to look for). This greatly reduced my enjoyment at a critical point in the game.\n\nThe story, while interesting overall, leaves a lot hanging at the end. Technically there's a few illustrations in the credits, but they provide very little info on the result of the finale and not much closure for the story. Given the insane puzzles in the finale, I was disappointed to have it just end after all that work without a satisfying conclusion.\n\nAdd to that the relative shortness of the game (there's an achievement for finishing the game in under an hour) and the high price for this type of game, I unfortunately cannot recommend this game at the asking price. If it's on sale it's worth playing if you enjoy point and click games (with the use of a guide to get past those poorly designed puzzles at the end), but otherwise there are more enjoyable point and click adventures for your money.","May 28","false","10.1"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","23","28","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MusicallyInspired/recommended/232790/","MusicallyInspired","MusicallyInspired","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MusicallyInspired/","405 products in account","As a backer of the Kickstarter for this game, I was given early access to Act I. So I won't spoil any of the story, but I will say that this is a very good adventure game experience, on par with the classics of the Golden Era (80s & 90s). I've been waiting for these games to come back and what better way to re-usher them in than with a brand new game from Tim Schafer himself, an adventure star who designed the likes of Full Throttle, Grim Fandango, and Day of the Tentacle. He also had a hand in designing the first two Monkey Island games by Ron Gilbert. These are adventure gaming classics. I've only played half the game so far, but the other half is coming in a few months as of this writing. That said here are my thoughts:\n\nThe Good:\n\n-Story. Very intriguing. I was very invested in both the girl and boy's characters and was quite interested to see where their stories would take them and how they'd eventually intertwine. The experience was not unrewarding and definitely wasn't a disappointment!\n\n-Writing. Tim's humour is expectedly very present in the game. His trademark sarcasm and wit are strewn throughout the dialogue and even into some of the look of the locations. It's a very bizarre and funny world Tim has created, but not too bizarre. Just recognizable enough to not seem too far out and unrelatable.\n\n-Art style. The 2D painted artwork style is fantastic. I was initially skeptical in the beginning of Bagel's art style, once I'd seen some of his work in one of the hidden backer forum threads on the Double Fine forums. But I have to say that my skepticism was misplaced. This game has a lovely quality and very pleasing aesthetic. The artwork truly does resemble a beautiful painting come to life. And despite this it is absolutely brimming with detail in every scene. It's beautiful to just sit and watch, but it also works very well for the gaming experience and story. Some of the girl's locations actually reminded me of Curse of Monkey Island, even though the styles are wildly different. While the boy's space ship is unlike anything I've ever seen for a space ship. It's all very unique and with just a dash of familiarity in it as well.\n\n-Animation. Truly charming and natural. Everything seemed so alive. Not like puppets on strings, but real characters that were moving on their own. Special care was given to these animations. Every one showed amazing attention to detail and added a great deal of character to everything that moved. Every character in the game had their own unique persona that spoke volumes about their motivations and intentions. One of my favourite aspects of the design of the game!\n\n-Voice acting. Top notch. Every voice puts a life and an identity into their characters in a way that binds them to their personas where I could not justify turning voices off and just reading subtitles. The voices are truly special and unique and are really part of the experience in a huge way. So don't mute them.\n\n-Soundtrack. Peter McConnell did a fantastic job with the soundtrack. The themes are very fitting and atmospheric, yet the themes for the boy and girl and their locales are separate and distinct from eachother, as should be expected. Peter doesn't disappoint. As a backer, I also received the soundtrack to the game which I immediately put straight on my player for my long drives to work. And it's played by a live orchestra. Can't beat that. Truly effective work. Bravo, Peter.\n\n\nThe "Wish-It-Was-Better":\n\n-Puzzles. The heart of the adventure game experience (combined with story). There are some great puzzles in this game, but as a veteran adventure gamer I was expecting a bit more of a challenge. Especially in the beginning, the puzzles were fairly simple. I assume to ease in new or rusty players. Luckily these simple "tutorial" puzzles didn't last long at all end began to become more complex soon enough, to my relief. As long as I was thorough, however, I never missed anything. Years of adventure gaming has taught me to leave no stone unturned and to keep a mental map image in my head of where certain characters, objects, and puzzles were located. This made it easier to deduce when and where I'd be needing certain objects or what objects I might need in certain areas. I ended up acquiring all of the objects I needed ahead of time before I needed to use them, which sped up the gameplay a bit. But that's due to my obsessive style of exploration. Other gamers might not share this and thus wouldn't run into the same problem, which would probably extend the experience for them. There was no so-called "moon logic" in this game, which many classic adventure games were infamous for. Personally, I never had a problem with extremely hard puzzles and enjoyed them, but many others (especially nowadays) don't share this feeling. Luckily, they won't be disappointed with this game as a result.\n\n-Length. Keeping in mind that I have only played Act I, I still have to say it was somewhat shorter than I expected. If Act I is truly an exact halfway point in the game, then I can only hope that the puzzles in Act II are much more difficult. I wish it was longer. I'll have to put it away for a year or two after completing Act II and come back to it to see just how long the game actually is with a fresh perspective from beginning to end.\n\n\nOverall, the world of Broken Age is an immensely pleasing and fun one to live in and explore. The story is gripping and mysterious. By the end of Act I you are left wondering just WHAT in the world is going on! It left me wanting more, but in a good way. Luckily we will be getting more! I encountered no bugs whatsoever. The game played extremely smoothly and there were no unexpected quirks. I was finding myself missing the skip dialogue function from the older LucasArts SCUMM engine games by pressing '.'. Instead it only lets you skip entire "cutscenes" of dialogue. Not a huge issue, as there never really was anything that I needed to skip specifically to get at something new from a repeated conversation. I would like a "retro" filter shortcut for the game to make it seem all pixelated and 90s looking if only for the novelty. ;)\n\nI highly recommend this game to those who enjoy a good story in gaming and those who appreciate a work of art. Newcomers to the adventure genre who are mildly curious but fearful of ominously difficult puzzles needn't worry as everything is intuitive and logical, but still challenging enough I feel to give you a great experience without seeming too easy or too short. Adventure veterans may find the challenge a little lackluster, but what little it may lack in puzzle challenge it makes up for in pretty much everything else. It won't be the next puzzle masterpiece adventure game, but it is surely a very good start to the great Adventure Resurgence! It appeals to old and new fans alike and, I feel, is the perfect bridge to link the two together. Take us onward, Double-Fine! Here's hoping for more adventures after Broken Age!","January 14, 2014","true","14.8"," 80 of 128 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","80","128","3","0"

It had Tim Schafer's company behind. A man that co-designed the first two Monkey Island games and Maniac Mansion: Day of the Tentacle. When I think "Classic Point and Click Adventure" I think of the games listed above as well as the old Sierra games. But I suppose I set myself up for some amount of disappointment by making assumptions based on the information above.\n\nI knew I was in trouble when nothing in the game seemed to stump me. I never really had any moments where I truly had no idea what to do next. This is a huge mistake when it comes to adventure games. When I needed an item to do something, I always knew which item I needed and usually had it or knew where it was. And if a character had it they would, almost always, just give it to me without reservation. Without any puzzles hard enough to slow me down I had it beat in under 4 hours. And I was taking it easy, reading all the dialog choices and trying to click on everything I possibly could for extra story and dialog. Some people had it beat in an hour and some change. Classic point and click adventure games were short but only if you already knew what you were doing. The old games were hard enough to slow people down and give them a challenge so no one ever beat them that fast the first time through.\n\nNow I'm not saying it's terrible. I really like the art style and the story is interesting. It be nice if the game itself could catch up. I'd say if you want to try this, wait for a sale later down the road.","January 16, 2014","false","4.2"," 151 of 253 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","151","253","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredriknd/recommended/232790/","fredriknd","Fnord","http://steamcommunity.com/id/fredriknd/","2595 products in account","Broken age is the game that really got kickstarter started for games. While it's not the first game, it helped opening the floodgates. And a lot of great games have come out of kickstarter. So, how does Broken Age hold up?\n\nLet me just start this review with saying that no, I've not actually beaten the game.. And I don't feel like doing so, despite having less than 1/3 of it left. That's probably saying a lot about the game.\n\nGraphics & Sound\nBroken Age has a very distinct art style. While it might not have the most advanced graphics on the market, it has its own visual identity. If it looks good or not, well that's up to each and every one of us to decide, but the screenshots are representative. The game looks like it does in the screenshots. Personally, I'm a fan of it, I think it's a very pleasing art style. Some of the animations do look a bit off though, and the character models sometimes look like they're not really a part of the world, but overlayed on it. For the most part though, it looks good.\nOne can't talk about Broken Age without mentioning the voice acting. It's excellent. The voice actors all convey the personalities of the characters really well, and it does not sound phoned in. Looking at the list of voice actors this is not surprising though, these are veteran voice actors. The soundtrack is no slouch either, and while it's unlikely to be remembered as one of the all time greatest, it works well with the game, and actually sounds really good.\n\nStory & Setting\nBroken age follows two different characters, Vella & Shay, who live very different lives. Vella grew up in a colourful fantasy world, terrorized by a big beast who demands a sacrifice of maidens (and she is one of the maidens who's going to be sacrificed), while Shay lives on board a space ship that caters to his every needs. And never the two shall meet. Or so it feels at least, during half the game. The two characters are entirely separate, and their stories don't seem to relate in any meaningful way. And this, I feel, was a mistake. As the two stories are so disconnected from each other, it's easy to just focus on one character at a time and ignoring the other. The stories do of course end up crossing each other, but then they split again.\nI found Vella to both have a more compelling story, and to be a more interesting character. Shay just felt a bit bland, where when I was playing through Vella's story I found the game interesting and it motivated me to push forward.\n\nGameplay\nThis is a traditional adventure game, in the vein of the games made by Lucas Arts in the mid 90's. Puzzles are mostly inventory based. Find the item that goes with the other item or character, which gives you an item that you then can use to solve a puzzle that gives you another item. It's all very traditional, and there's nothing wrong with that. The issue are with the puzzles. During the first half of the game you're mostly confined to small areas with few items, so even if you can't figure out a logical way for the items to fit together, you don't have many combinations to worry about, so brute-forcing puzzles is easy. During the second half the puzzles gets more involved, but they also don't make much sense. Even after having solved some puzzles, I don't know how I was supposed to know what to do. Moon logic is often used to describe puzzles like these, puzzles that don't make much logical sense, and there's a good amount of moon logic in Broken Age. The worst offenders are the puzzles that require you to use one character in order to find hints on how to solve puzzles for the other character, where the two characters have no way of communicating with each other. It does not make much sense to switch to another character in order to solve a puzzle when they have no way of interacting. The game also does not communicate that you should do this, and in the first half of the game it teaches you that you don't need to switch characters to solve puzzles.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWhile Broken Age is by no means terrible, I feel that I can't recommend it. The moon logic puzzles in the second act and a story where only one half feels compelling just killed it for me. Had the stories been more intertwined and the puzzles better, this game could have been a winner, but as it stands, it just feels like wasted potential.","April 11","false","5.5"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","79","22","28","0","0"

As Vella and Shay you revisit same exact locations as in part one, to do some of the most annoying puzzles I had the displeasure of solving. That was a throwback to "good old days" I did not expect.\n\nWhat caught me by surprise is how all character development from Act1 was seemingly replaced by almost nothing at all. Have you ever wondered how Vella's rebellion against decades-old traditions will resolve? How will her family and whole community of Sugar Bunting will react once she returns? Perhaps you wanted to know if Shay will manage to break free from his patronising prison? Being so used to infantile challenges how will he cope with harsh reality? Well, you certainly won't get the satisfying answers here. Broken Age just suddenly stops being a game that explores the themes of adolescence in unusual situations and complexities of being a teenager and becomes convoluted mess that pulls out plot points from nowhere.\n\nCan't recommend at this price.

Broken Age tries to blend fantasy and sci-fi into one big weird world with two protagonists. As in many other adventure games (Gemini Rue goes up to my mind at the moment), you can switch between protagonists anytime.\n\nIn the world from fantasy theme view, you play as Vella, young baker girl who is just supposed to be sacrificed towards big flying Lovecraftian monster because of the tradition that promises villages not being destroyed for offering in form of young ladies. All people think of it as honor to be sacrificed, but Vella would rather pay the iron price.\n\nFrom futuristic theme view, you play as Shay, a boy who is living in a spaceship with his "Mom" and "Dad". Although he has a carefree life there, he gets sullen because of the repeating rutine of eating, sleeping and completing missions that should make him feel like a hero. But... even he already realised there's something not right there.\n\nYou may now ask how does such different storylines can be put together in one game but that doesn't deserve a proper answer - just put up with the fact that it's possible and it's believable. That applies fully to the Act I (at the early access phase of the game, only the first act was available, so the game got a lot of praise).\n\nThe second act changed opinion of many people, myself included. There are many plotholes and nonsense parts which could be overlooked if there wasn't the ending that, story-wise, feels rushed. Oh my, isn't that Double Fine's tradition? I remember similar impression from Brütal Legend!\n\nDifficulty of the game varies on, surprisingly, acts. The first act is pretty easy, you will stay in flow, happily continuing through the story. The second act rises with difficulty that can get you stuck at some moments, but I think it's still in bearable for most players. The ending is something frustrating and hard, even though it plays on lesser amount of rooms.\n\nBut everything isn't worth criticizing, the game doesn't deserve it. In both acts, characters have a good sense of humour, there are many nice gags and puns. It's also worth mentioning there's more references pointed towards specific groups of people and communities than towards games. Finally a game that tries to be funny without arrow in the knee! (Even though it's a hyperbole, I still think those gaming references are overused in games that are trying to be funny.)\n\nVisual style perfectly expresses the unique world of Broken Age and I don't think there's anything to reproach, if you don't mind more room recyclation as the story is revolving just in few specific places. What almost could not be better is the voice acting that's really great! (It would be weird if it wasn't, as there are professional actors.)\n\nConclusion:Broken Age is a disappointment for everybody who went with the hype that started with its Kickstarter campaign, because it ended up as a mediocre adventure made by well-known studio. If the game held the difficulty through all acts, and was properly finished without much nonsense around, it would be definitely great. But it isn't, it's just another point and click adventure game. Still even through the negative aspects I mentioned, I think it's worth buying on sale.\n\n\nFor more reviews, join Samurai Vader's Point of View group and follow my curator page, I'm always happy to see feedback about my reviews.","February 13","true","16.7"," 35 of 52 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","35","52","0","0"

I even held out judgement until the second act was released.\n\nI could argue for the antiquated mechanics but still it's that one puzzle whe Shea needs to program a robot, and the robot's programming uses shapes seen all across his own ship. So as vella you explore his ship for some kind of robot programming clue and nothing. Then once you spend 2 hours and give up and cheat do they say "Oh on the blackboard of the picture with Shae with his mom is a small image of the pattern you need" That alone made this a terrible experience because that is the second of Shae's puzzles and the rest of his are in the same vein where they simply expect you to just figure these things out through complete nonsense backwards logic.\n\nI don't mind fetch quests, and having to try multiple times, and even having to pay attention to obscure clues. (One of my favorite games is Myst.) But if you're going to decide that the player now needs to keep a collection of screenshots half a gig large just to solve your games puzzles then ef you.

No. You better keep reading, though, because the "why" behind that answer is more important than the answer. Puzzle design in the "Act 1" area was genuinely good if not a bit easy. I didn't find myself ever having to ask online for a hint and I didn't get stuck to the point of frustration. It was a very smooth ride all and all. "Act 2" shatters this perception and introduces puzzles that, while somewhat logical, are terribly designed.\n\nOne example of this is the tube puzzle at the beginning of Vela's second chapter. The puzzle itself makes sense, but the way one interact with objects is wonky. Often I found that clicking on something to move it required me to hold down the button and drag, oftentimes I only needed to click and move. The worst part of the puzzle is that the entire thing could have occupied one screen, but it was  split in half which make moving pieces between the two halves awkward. Luckily, the solution to the puzzle is apparent very quickly so it's really only the wonky interface blocking your progress.\n\nThis seems to often be the case. The game's final puzzle is huge and intricate, and seemingly involves time-based maneuvers when, in actuality, it uses very illogical movement triggers instead. Instead of giving the feeling that characters are working together to solve a puzzle, it becomes a tedious trial and error affair long after you figure out the entire solution. Sadly, I think the poorly designed puzzles would often dampen my enjoyment of what was otherwise a funny or emotional moment.\n\nThe good news, though, is that puzzle design is my only gripe. It's not insignificant. There is one mechanic that was NEVER used in the first game that gets used a few times without any subtle prompting, but I won't spoil it because I consider it a puzzle solution in and of itself.\n\nAfter all this, why should am I recommending that you buy Broken Age? Simple, because those things I just described were present in Grim Fandango, they were present in Day of the Tentacle, and they were in Full Throttle as well. This game feels old school in the best and worst ways. Plus, the characters are fantastic. Every one of them is so well-written and bursting with personality that I would easily drop money on a Broken Age 2 right now just to see more of them. The story reminds me of Schafer's Full Throttle. It has an excellent flow, but just kind of ends. Not in a BAD way, mind you, but in a way that says, "this story isn't over" without sequel baiting.\n\nFans of adventure games old and new owe it to themselves to play this game. As long as you understand that it's not a flawless puzzler then you will find beauty and comedy that will make you laugh out loud at time. It captures that mix of wit and almost fatalistic mirth that makes Tim Schafer one of my favorite video game writers (and Doublefine such a fine team). It's a flawed gem, but still a very valuable one and well woth playing.","April 29, 2015","true","13.3"," 162 of 280 people (58%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","58","162","280","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwwtbg/recommended/232790/","gwwtbg","gwwtbg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gwwtbg/","185 products in account","Broken Age is a beautifully crafted experience that is unfortunately somewhat marred by the dramatic increase in puzzle difficulty in the second part of the game which comes too suddenly and will therefore likely take players off guard.\n\nThe game follows two separate coming-of-age stories, one centred on the boy Shay and the other on the girl Vella – the two live in different worlds but find out that their lives are intertwined in a surprising way.\n\nBroken Age was clearly crafted with a lot of love and care, and the production quality is outstanding. The writing is great, the voice acting is exemplary and the art is simply gorgeous. The  game looks hand-painted and it is clear that a lot of effort went into making it look beautiful and feel unique. The game's world is not all that big, but every location is different and new, and there are many interesting characters. One of the protagonists, Shay, is voiced by Elijah Wood, who is apparently a big fan of adventure games and asked if he could be involved in the project. Some other famous names are in the game as well: Jack Black does a great job voicing the cult leader H'rmony, Will Wheaton appears as a lumberjack afraid of trees, while the amazing Jennifer Hale (voice of FemShep in Mass Effect) is present as the ship's Mom computer.\n\nThe writing might be my favourite part of the game, the dialogue is really well written and frequently contains a lot of humour, like the lines Vella delivers to make a tree vomit, practically anything involving Shay's yarn pals, or the responses from Shay's talking utensils.\n\nIt is a really great game in many aspects.\n\nHowever, Broken Age also has one (pretty big) problem, which players who played the game upon completion, as opposed to playing Act 1 first and then Act 2 a year later, might have felt more acutely: the puzzles in the second part of the game are much more complex and difficult to figure out. What started as very much a casual experience – the puzzles in the first half of the game are most of the time quite simple to figure out – suddenly turns into something much more challenging and different from what came before.\n\nBroken Age was originally released in two parts, with over a year between the release of the first part and the release of the complete game. In the documentary about the making of the game,* it is clear that the developers felt that they should make the puzzles in Act 2 more difficult because players would have learned from the puzzles in Act 1 and would expect a greater challenge in Act 2. However, playing through the game as a whole, the sudden spike in difficulty halfway through feels like it came out of nowhere and takes the player by surprise. It is something that makes the experience feel disjointed, since the entire first half of the game sets the player up for a specific kind of experience which is then pretty radically changed.\n\nThe puzzles in the second half are not impossible; some of them might try the player's patience but for the most part they are well thought out. However, they will require the player to rethink how they approach them halfway through the game and that switch might be somewhat jarring for some, or even annoying if a casual experience was one of the things that drew them to the game. On the other hand, some players will probably welcome the more challenging puzzles of the second part, feeling that it is the puzzle experience they were looking for.\n\n\n\n*The documentary is called Double Fine Adventure and is available in its entirety on Double Fine's YouTube page. It consists of 20 episodes and follows the entire development cycle of the game, from the Kickstarter in 2012 to the game's completion in 2015. If you are even remotely interested in how games are developed, I strongly urge you to watch the documentary because it is incredibly insightful.","November 18, 2015","true","16.6"," 68 of 115 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","68","115","0","2"

So, here is Broken Age -- Tim Schäfer's first true Point n' Click adventure since Grim Fandango. It's been a while but it's amazing to see him return to the form. This is his hometurf and what he does best. But does it hold up to his usual standard. I'd certainly say so. Now some may say that the game's puzzles (which adventure games are so famous for) are fairly straigtforward. To a degree, they are, but I found myself thinking a bit every now and then.\n\nDisregarding all that  -- The comedy and charm is as strong as ever -- You play as 2 characters this time, in 2 different settings, but both of them are related to the other in some way, which you'll discover as you play. First of we got Mr. Frodo, going by the name of Shay, who's a rather ordinary teenage boy, trapped in what most 10-12 year old boys might consider a Utopia, but Shay considers it a dull routine of nightmarish proportions.. because everything is done for you (You know, like how the gaming industry of today is -- Hurr, hurr) or in other words, just dull (like how we all felt during our mid-teens). Shay gets to live in futuristic space-ship, alongside an overprotective AI Motherbrain, who sees to his every needs (Feeding him with a spoon, tucking him in bed, turn every day adventure into easy mode --lol--). His life is basically devoid of excitement in an otherwise adventurous-looking setting --  Shay, getting bored of this ridiculous pretense, decides to flee from it, and accept an invitation from an ominous looking wolf-dressed man named Marek, ready to show him the true hardships of life and how sucky it can be sometimes. Meanwhile in a rural village is our other protagonist, Villa, who's just about ready for the traditional Maiden's Feast, involving her getting eaten by a Lovecraftian monstrosity. Neat.\n\nIn true Tim Schäfer style, all of the characters feel and act rather mundane but to an absurd degree. They all seem to think of the Maiden's Feast as an exciting celebration, like it was Christmas, despite it revolving around sacrificing innocent girls to be eaten by a cosmic monstrosity. Villa being the protagonist, asks what we are all thinking.. "Why the bleeding hell don't we just kill the damn thing?". But no, that would be going against a tradition that no one seems to bother changing because new things are scary, just like in real life -- And there you got it.\nSo as the tentacle beast devours the Maidens, Villa being the only rational human being left, decides to flee and learn how to kill the monster and save her village. It doesn't take long 'till Villa comes across an array of interesting caricatures, whom she has to help in order to proceed -- Among my favorites is the rather 'baked' lumberjack fellow named Curtis & the leader of the Cloud society, Meriloft, voiced by Jack Black.\nTrue to its adventure roots, the game has various interpretations of keys for various interpretations of doors, which the player has to figure out in order to proceed. The puzzles are definitely still there but they are not at the league of more complex puzzles like that of the Silent Hill 2-3 games or older Schäfer adventures. What really sells this game is the humor, the characters, the artwork and especially the music. It's all very, very, gorgeous and this is how Adventure games are done -- Where Schäfer shines and Telltale does not. It's recommended to do Shay's story first, then finish it with Villa since her story is a bit longer. An actual negative I can give about the game is the fact that what you're getting isn't the whole game -- Act 2 is still in the making, but it'll be for free whenever, and thus obviously the game ends on a cliff-hanger, but an intriguing one nevertheless. Lastly, I musn't forget.\n\nOn the audio side you might notice the voicing talents of Jennifer Hale, Will Wheaton, Jack Black (returning from previous Double Fine game Brütal Legend and of course Elijah Wood himself -- Mr. Frodo). All of them do a superb job of enriching the adventure game experience by adding their sharp voices to the humor. Schäfer's voice director has done a splendid job to utilize all of the famous voices correctly. So a thumbs up for that and you'll have to forgive me for not mentioning the other voices, because there are certainly a few noteworthy ones. From a spaceship with talking cutlery, to a cloud society of sky people living with birds -- What you're getting is the Tim Schäfer experience that you'll recognize. So if enjoyed previous Double Fine games or the old LucasArts adventures, then don't cheat yourself out of this experience. While the game isn't complete yet, it is still very much worth it. But it might adviceable to wait a bit before one delves into it when the whole game is complete.","February 22, 2014","true","8.0"," 32 of 51 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","32","51","3","12"

But can Broken Age be put among his best creations? In my humble opinion, it definitely can. All the characteristic features are present: captivating storyline, original setting, interesting (and many quite absurd) characters, dialogues filled with humour, top-notch voice acting, good music…\nBroken Age is a story of a girl and a boy, each one with unique circumstances, that try to escape from their destiny, but the way this story is told is unlike any other you may have ever read. I don’t want to spoil the game by revealing the details, but, if you like the games of Double Fine Productions or good adventure games in general, I can pretty much guarantee you won’t be disappointed. I, for one, have barely noticed how I’ve spent 20 hours playing, reading, laughing, solving puzzles and, most of all, enjoying the ride.	Surely, if you want to, you will likely find some weak points in Broken Age, but as it never was my intention, I can truthfully say that those 20 hours were like a breath of fresh air.\nHighly recommended.

Vella's voice acting is atrocious, but the main problem is that after the first, semi-decent "setup" of a first act, the second act retreads old grounds, literally, constantly. Puzzles involve running back and forth in areas already explored, testing player patience with puzzles that require some setup and then backtracking multiple times to solve. Broken Age's final puzzle is the distillation of everything the could be considered backtracking. It's backtracking incarnate. It's apex backtracking. It's so extraordinarily dry that it is only trumped in unpleasantness by the extremely terrible story. Many assets are not really "high res", and often in closeup shots things are pixelated, but that's the least of the game's problems. You spend more time requiring robots than you do exploring this tiny, miniature slice of the "world" they've created, which honestly is not really delved in to much, which is probably a good thing considering anything they attempt to explain or justify makes no sense, but for some reason seems "logical" to the participants in the story. Many of the jokes are okay, but the majority of the show is stolen by sentient silverware and other bit characters with excellent voice actors; it's more delivery rather than what they are saying, which is derivative most of the time of Tim's other works, collaborative or otherwise. It's not bad, but it's not an amazing experience (Day of the Tentacle) or what I'd call his magnum opus.\n\nI made a terrible, terrible mistake backing this game. I regret ever suggesting that donating to this was a good idea. It was a three and a half year blueballing. Double Fine's been coasting on the critical success of Psychonauts for a decade now, and honestly they really need to get their ♥♥♥♥ together and beg Ron Gilbert to join them if they ever think of making another point and click again. All of these old point and click games had teams of designers and writers that made them great, and Tim's not able to fill that position on his own, obviously.","April 29, 2015","false","10.3"," 39 of 65 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","39","65","0","0"

The story really goes downhill, the puzzle difficulty has some serious spikes and just aren't as fun, the pacing and everything feels extremely rushed, you don't really meet any completely new characters, the writing is much lower quality, you don't go to any new locations, and all in all everything just feels very rushed and stripped down.

Starting its life as a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign that has since inspired multiple other dream projects. Crafted by the same team that made the original Grim Fandango, Broken Age was developed as a throwback to adventure games of the past. The game is drawn up in a pastel-heavy style that is both beautiful and appropriate for the wacky antics Double Fine is known for — don’t let it deter you either. Broken Age is a fantastic journey that has a little something for everyone.\n\nThe story is split between dual protagonists, Vella and Shay, who share more in common than first meets the eye in a universe filled with twists, turns and well-placed illusions. Vella is a girl who has been selected by her village peers to be a living sacrifice to a monster known as the Mog Chothra — and wishing to shed her fate, sets off to escape. Shay is a young boy who lives in the confines of his very own spaceship, under the watchful eye of a motherly computer who works to protect him at all costs. Shay too grows tired of his “traditions” and sneaks off to seek the thrill of real adventure.\n\nEverything comes to a head at the end of Act 1 when the story concludes several shocking developments before transitioning into the second Act where things become even more interesting for the dual protagonists as they swap places and explore their new worlds. The only downside to this development is the amount of recycled content — you’ll be revisiting a lot of the same NPCs and as a result it takes away from a lot of the discovery the first Act introduced for players. Those qualms aside though, I did enjoy going back and seeing how the circumstantial differences had changed things I already knew. The dialogue alone does not disappoint.\n\nWhen you start the game you’ll have the option straight away of choosing between Vella or Shay’s tale — both of which can be swapped interchangeably any time you feel like a change of pace. Shay’s story is a bit more exploration and puzzle-heavy, where as Vella’s is more dialogue-heavy with many cutscenes in between traditional fetch-quest segments often found in typical adventure games. You’ll find yourself playing through both characters to get the whole picture here but that’s where Broken Age really shines. Its writing is clever and its characters are done through with a good amount of depth and occasional silliness. Double Fine’s work here is top notch and the various twists and reveals throughout the story kept me reaching for more.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, Broken Age is your standard adventure game romp through the use of point-and-click gestures, inventory management and dialogue options players have come to expect over the years.  Broken Age really encourages exploration — and element forced on you to advance the story, which often involves the use of clever puzzles which have equally easy to understand and use controls.\n\nBroken Age is a wonderful experience that I can’t recommend enough. As someone who grew up on the LucasArts-style adventure games of old Double Fine has pulled through with just enough nostalgia and modern aesthetic, offering up a fresh and funny classic in an age where blockbuster games rule the roost.","June 6","true","24.4"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","8","8","0","0"

There is plenty of good humor for young and old alike. Of course there are puzzles that will test your lateral thinking and creativity.\n\nElijah Woods, Wil Wheaton, Jack Black and the creator of Adventure Time and others... they all add their voices to the acting and story of the game.\n\nI do not want to give away too many details, but being that this game was one of the most successful kick-starters ever, I suggest you do your research.

One might say, a double failed adventure.\n\nThe game has some things that work well, like the animation, the graphics and everything audio.\nFor those wondering where the multi million budgetdisappeared, I assume the famous voiceovers are partialy to blame. Is Jack Black's or Elijah Wood's voices essential to the enjoyment of this game? Not when it comes at the expense of the actual gameplay.\n\nI've read on the forums some complaints about the difficulty of the puzzles. As a longtime adventure point and click aficionada, I thought they were of medium difficulty and if you really took the time to look for the solution, you would eventually find it (with one or two exceptions - like the wire puzzle). The main problem of the game is that it is tedious. The characters and the story are very unidimensional, there is no real substance, no nuances to them and the puzzles are there only so that you have something to do towards ending the game. There are so many loose ends, so many missed opportunities, you can only wonder how much thought they actually put in the game. In the end, you don't really care about any of the characters, you're glad it's over.\n\nThe cherry on top, after two years of waiting for a full game, you get an incomplete ending that seems to suggest there will be a third act. I see that as a slap in the face of everybody who ever payed for this game.\n\nI left my original review at the bottom part of this comment.\n\nFirst of all, cannot believe they still haven't released the second part yet.  They could have delivered a full game only on the money they got from Kickstarter. Yes, the graphics are nice but other developers deliver similar or even better animations on less than half of that budget.\nRegarding the story: at first, I felt it had a lot of potential, but it turned out to be pretty dull. The characters are not interesting and the puzzles are uninspired. I cannot fully rate it, because I could only play half of it, but I definitely put a pin in this game creator.\nThere are other lesser known but better games out there like The Chronicles of Zerzura, the Chains of Satinav etc","March 9, 2015","false","23.1"," 25 of 40 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","25","40","0","0"

The plot/game world made no sense and the comedy was weak. Art wise the game has been consistently bad, it looks like barely any effort was put in. There's a weeks worth of background art and a days worth of character design in there.\nThe puzzles were needlessly long, requiring a fair bit of running around through the same 6 or so screens. This only inflated the game length rather than add difficulty or enjoyment. If they put the objects for each puzzle within one or two rooms then this game would be even shorter. It's not the difficulty of the puzzles that takes so long, it's having to go back and forth and jot things down on a bit of paper. The only reason it took me as long as it did to complete this game is because I went into act 2 expecting not to need any paper. If you went in fully prepared you could probably beat the game in under 5 hours (not skipping dialogue).\n\nThe Book of Unwritten Tales series and Deponia are far superior. Wouldn't buy this game for more than £8 if I hadn't already paid as much as I did.

Act 1 is all about setting up the story with a few puzzles here and there but nothing that will get in the way of enjoying the experience. Then you get to Act 2 and it feels like you're hitting a wall with puzzle after puzzle that will make you go back and forth, the game never makes it that apparent what you can or can't interact with either so sometimes you may need to pickle hunt. It can be frustrating and unintuitive as sometimes you will have to find something using one character to use with the other as if their minds are telepathically linked.\n\nIt is unfortunate as the game did have a lot of promise in Act 1 with interesting characters, a story set up to make you wonder what is going on with this world, decent voice acting and writing but by the end because of the frustration I felt, act 2's story didn't save it and felt almost trapped behind the puzzles, the ending wasn't very satisfying either so I left the game feeling dejected.\n\nI cannot recommend this game, if you are all about the puzzles then you may well enjoy this but then you'd probably feel that act 1 was too easy and possibly boring for you. If you're more interesting in story, characters and the world then you could just end up feeling like I did.","May 4, 2015","false","15.9"," 24 of 39 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","24","39","0","0"

The kickstarter was launched asking for $400,000 and they ended up with $3.45 million. Yet they blew their money too quickly and ended up having to release a first act to try and raise funds for the second. Which a lot of people deemed the second act to be lazy and rushed.\n\nAll of that aside, in my opinion Double Fine do great games. I’ve been following them for a while now and so far I haven’t been all that disappointed with anything that they’ve made that I have played. Despite their games always having a somewhat childlike feel to them, I always enjoy them.\n\nSometimes I do wonder if this would have gotten so much hate if the game was released as normal with people being pretty unaware of the recent drama and goings on of Double Fine. If you were to buy this game without knowing anything about it, I think more people would enjoy it.\n\nThis was kickstarted shortly after the “Amnesia Fortnight” events that Double Fine did, of which I loved. So I backed this since the beginning. From what feels like forever ago, I just never really bothered all that much actually watching or getting involved with it. It’s kind of been just a dusty book on the shelf until now. I finally got around to playing it and can say I think they did a really great job with it. I may actually go and watch the documentary now.\n\nThe story is definitely interesting. Luckily by the time I played it the second act was already out. I can’t imagine myself being all that happy about having to wait quite a while for the next act. But that’s down to pure impatience. I wanted to know what was going on straight away. I was expecting something a little different when it came to the story, but it surprised me in a good way. The story comes together in ways I couldn’t predict.\n\nI think most people’s problem with the story is that a lot of act 1 is the set up. It asks all the questions, it gets you interested and it leaves you on a cliff hanger. After all that waiting, act 2 came out and honestly I can understand people’s disappointment. Most questions are straight up just answered. No real build up. The answers were somewhat brief, vague and honestly there are some holes in the story which made me wonder. I get the feeling most people yearned for more information or something much deeper then what it turned out to be. But I see this game again as almost child-like and light hearted. It honestly didn’t bother me all that much. I still enjoyed it and didn’t at all feel any sense of real disappointment concerning the plot.\n\nThe art in the game is really nice. It’s smooth and wonderfully drawn. The audio is well done both music and voice acting wise. I can only assume they blew most of that budget getting Elijah Wood in. The puzzles are straight forward most of the time, which again I think rustled some jimmies. But I honestly enjoyed a little bit more simplicity. It helped the game flow a bit better for me. I could progress and find out what the fudge was going on (I can be impatient when it comes to plotlines). The main kind of puzzle at the end I found a lot of fun. As to where to find the solution is annoying, but deciphering what everything means was quite fun for me.\n\nUsually I end up getting frustrated with point and click games (I think many people do) as it can sometimes be pretty easy to get stuck.\nAdmittedly, I still got stuck on this a few times for a fair while but the puzzles and combinations are logical enough to not be stuck (and therefore annoyed) for very long. It’s also a nice feature to the game being able to switch between characters and take a break from what you were doing.\n\nThe annoying part is the achievements (if you are even into achievements, I suppose). I personally insisted on 100%ing the game.\nIt took me 18 hours and I have to say it was a little tedious. That may be just because I stayed up until 1am no-lifing and ended up quite tired and annoyed with it… but still. If you’re looking for an easy 100% it’s not all that easy. It’s do-able but you’ll need to be meticulous, complete it a few times over and be able to be quite fast about a complete play through to do it.\n\nAll in all, I enjoyed this game. I thought it was great. Was also nice to see Pendleton Ward doing some voice work for Double Fine after the last Amnesia Fortnight. I hope to see more of that.\nKeep it up Double Fine!\n\n\nTL;DR : Despite all the recent Double Fine drama, it’s a great story,  it had good audio, visuals and puzzles. It has achievements that actually do feel an achievement to get and it just generally is another great game by Double Fine. I’d think any point and click or Double Fine fan would like this game. If you’re neither or those things, try it anyway. I still think there’s a chance you might enjoy it despite Double Fine’s games always having a slight childlike feel to them.","May 9, 2015","true","18.7"," 57 of 101 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","57","101","3","0"

Tim Schafer is known for creating Grim Fandango (I never played it), which is loved by many and to be honest, I wish I was around to play it. He is also known for other things I bet, I am planning on doing research later. I love adventure games, and usually have it at the top of my list for things to play, and those with amazing stories please even more. When I first saw Broken Age on VGX, I was imediately hooked just by the art style and concept of the story. I got my hands on the game 5 months later than I hoped, wishing I bought it right at the start. This game is absolutely amazing, and Double Fine does it's well known job of amazing wrting, and I found myself laughing and crying at many points throughout this game. At the start of the game however, I started to feel a bit bored after a while, and after I had that feeling, I am thrown right into the point where I am on the edge of my seat. It is sad to say that the game is only one act currently, and I found myself annoyed that I dont have a release date for act 2 yet.. Then again, I waited for act 1, and I got exactly what I wanted. Waiting for Act 2 may in fact be a pain just because I am so desperately waiting to jump back into the story of Shay and Vella, but whenever it comes out, I know it will be just as good as this part, if not better. This review is not the best one I know, but it really does not have to be to tell you that this game is beautiful and very entertaining. I honestly say get the game if you want to have an amazing adventure that has probably one of the greatest scripts and stories I have ever seen. Broken Age is amazing and creative, and showed me exactly why adventure games are amazing, and threw me back into the times where I did not have a chance to experience adventures at their core. 9.75/10 I would reccomend this game to anyone.","June 11, 2014","true","11.0"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","16","24","0","0"

My money supported Broken Age so I'm obviously biased. Nevertheless, this review is for non-backers who are interested in purchasing Broken Age.)\n\nBroken Age is both a huge risk for Double Fine and a return to form for them. Broken Age's origin is a popular one of initially a small revival of the old school adventure game genre with a small asking price of 400k. This was back when Kickstarter wasn't the monolithic giant that it is now. The project raised much more than that and went as high as 3.4 million dollars. The development of Broken Age can be called rocky at best with expectations being much higher than the Broken Age team ever dreamed of. As a backer I've had the privilege of seeing behind the curtain of game development and have seen the best and worst from the dev team. I had high hopes for Broken Age and the documentary gave me a higher investment for the project than any video game that I've ever looked forward to. Hell, any thing that has your name in the credits is hopefully something that you're proud of being involved with. So call me a fan boy or anything like that, but I won't back down from my stance on Broken Age. After much anticipation I must say that I really enjoyed my time with Broken Age.\n\nThe best thing that can be said for Broken Age is how great it looks. Every single environment has the look of it being hand painted and treated with care. You can notice it from looking around by how many things have smiley faces or from how everything seems to fit together perfectly. It was a joy to walk around every new area to see how bizarre yet familiar every environment looks. It's accompanied by a wonderful score that fits each new area. My personal favorite came from Shay's part as it reflects the space ship theme. All of it can fall apart if the actual game play and story don't mesh together well. That isn't the case for Broken Age.\n\nBroken Age's story is one of two characters that are each in different time periods and different situations that are worlds apart from each other. They both can seemingly never meet each other yet both have similar situations. Broken Age is a story of personal triumph from oppressive adults. Whether it be Shay's computer mother or Vella's grandmother both are set out to accomplish self-sacrifice for a goal that is of high importance. They both must decided if they should rebel against their elders in order to break tradition. You'll be able to aid both of them in any order you want to. I went with Shay's story first as I was more excited by space. Without spoiling anything I found the story and dialogue of Broken Age to be charming, funny, and nostalgic. This is the first adventure game that Tim Schafer has made in a long time. Grim Fandango was the last big adventure game that he's worked on as a writer. You could easily notice that he wrote Broken Age by how funny it is. The dialogue tree in particular made me laugh several times. It also has a lot of humor from using your inventory on any thing or one in the environment in order to get some kind of reaction. I haven't played a traditional adventure game since Tim Schafer left Lucas Arts so it was truly a nostalgic trip back to the days when adventure games were big on PC. That said, Broken Age isn't just a trip down memory lane. It's a story of breaking away from the past and paving a new future.\n\nDouble Fine promised a return to old school adventure games and it's a promise that was kept. Broken Age play like you typical adventure game with both a mouse cursor and an inventory. In Broken Age you'll have to solve many small puzzles in order to continue forward with the story. Some of these solutions make sense but others are as ridiculous as you'd expect from old adventure game logic. Luckily, it doesn't suffer from pixel hunting problems and brutally difficult puzzle logic. However, I wish that the game offered a button to let you know what kind of items are in the environment as most of the items that you'll put into your inventory don't stand out as well as I'd like.\n\nI also found most of the situations to be fairly easy to solve. I would've liked some more complex puzzles to be in the game. There's also a arm grabbing mini-game in Shay's section that is harder than it should be for something that is necessary to solve in order to beat the game. It's at times far too easy and mostly overly difficult for such a simple mini-game that isn't all that fun. It's also a game that deserves the Beta moniker as the game crashed multiple times for me. It also had numerous bugs such as text being unreadable and characters getting stuck in the environment. These bugs and crashes are an unfortunate part of the early release for us backers but hopefully it shouldn't be a problem once the game is released to the public.\n\nIt was probably impossible to fulfill the high expectations that many felt after the huge success of the Double Fine Kickstarter. However, as a backer I'm glad to say that my expectations were met for Broken Age. It certainly isn't the greatest adventure game ever but it's still a well worth your time and money. Broken Age is a highly polished journey that has memorable voices from Jack Black, Jennifer Hale, and even Elijah Wood. These voices were treated right and aren't simply cameos. Everything surrounding Broken Age is filled with the love and care that you'd expect a Double Fine game to have. That's the same with Broken Age but it's also amplified higher than ever before. A lot if riding on Broken Age and I felt that they succeed in making a great adventure game that can hang with the best of the genre. This could all go to ♥♥♥♥ if the second Act in Broken Age sucks but I'm confident that it won't after playing the first Act. It isn't perfect of course. I still feel that the mechanics and puzzles in the game were far too easy to solve or simply obtuse enough for me to be confused for longer than I'd like. Hopefully the second act has better puzzles to solve. The story and everything is strong enough that it overshadows the puzzles but it still hurts the overall package. I can't wait to finish the story of Broken Age as a backer and a fan of old school adventure games.","January 20, 2014","true","11.6"," 33 of 56 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","33","56","2","3"

Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, Maniac Mansion, and other Lucas Arts titles like Monkey Island and Sam & Max. This game is a continuation of those games.\n\nSome people complain that those old school graphic adventure titles had illogical puzzles that only made sense to the developers. And I'd say those are people with no imagination. Puzzle solving in these games are puns. There are clues that make them perfectly logical for the world that they're in and often require some degree of familiarity with tropes and cliché followed by subverting them.\n\nAct 2 has some very obtuse puzzles, but if you take the time to look at your environment, you can solve them.\n\nPlayers are so used to instant gratification. That is not what this game is about. Its a much slower game. That requires piecing together clues and exploring your options. Adventure games are not designed to be fast. They're designed to be clever.\n\nThis game is very clever. To get everything it has to offer you need to take it slow. You need time to reflect. There is so much narrative packed in to this game that's just hidden in plain sight.

Instead it brings an old school charm.\n\nIt seems not too much has changed in the 20 years since Tim Schafer last shipped a point and click adventure. The main difference is with the complexity of the puzzles. Broken Age is more story focused than puzzle focused with a simple single click interface replacing the verb system found in the old SCUMM games. But at the heart of this is Tim Schafer’s story, with colourful characters, imaginative settings and witty dialog.\n\nThe story focuses across the two protagonists stuck in an absurdity that they are trying to escape from; one on a spaceship that controls their every action, the other in a fantasy land where they joyfully given as a sacrifice to a mysterious beast.\nBoth of the settings are relatively small, but beautifully realised. Each story is largely independent with nothing like the item passing mechanic of Day of the Tentacle, meaning you can complete each at your own pace, swapping between the two characters at will.\n\nEverything comes together very nicely, from the writing, the excellent soundtrack and the beautiful story book art. There’s some excellent animation work as well and while a couple of lines fall flat, most of the voice work is very good.\n\nThere are a few minor issues, mainly with the interface. You can’t chose dialog options with the keyboard, the cursor is unnecessarily large and the inventory system is a bit awkward (I recombined rebinding right click to opening your inventory).\n\nThere’s a larger issue if you were hoping for brain teasing puzzles, but if you were looking for a captivating adventure game your only real complain will probably be that Act 1 comes to an end a bit too soon.\n","January 15, 2014","true","11.3"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

It is an absolute feast of an incredibly unique art design, with amazing soundtracks, and a great, great story. Divided into 2 parts, which both are included in price, one is currently available to play, and other one is in progress right now.\n\n(This review is written for people who are familiar with the genre, and have some brief background knowledge about it. I recommend you to pass if you are unfamiliar, since I'll be refering to some classics and relating Broken Age's quality to them.)\n\nI want to talk about the sounds of the game first, since it actually impresses me the most. As expected, Peter McConnell (He was responsible for soundtracks of many LucasArts and Double Fine Productions classics. Creator of that famous Monkey Island loop, pretty nice, eh?) did an amazing job on soundtracks, perfectly reflecting the spirits of places like Meriloft, Shellmound, Bossa Nostra, making you feel like you are actually there. It's one of the best game OST I've recently heard, along with Bastion, Transistor, Braid, and Thomas was Alone OST's. As for dialogues, what you'll encounter is beyond belief, as it was a Kickstarter funded game. Names like Elijah Wood and Jack Black are the voice actors, and they all have done an amazing job, also as expected. You may wonder like, "Where did they found all that money to pay them?", well, they actually didn't! Voice actors were making a huge pay-cut, willingly, just becaue they liked the game so much...\n\nLee Petty (He was also the art director of Brütal Legend.), working with Nathan Stapley (And he was the art director of Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, one of my first action-adventure games (and a pretty good one) after Tomb Raider.) did an absolutely gorgeous job for the visuals, that it's almost as amazing and unique as the art style of Curse of Monkey Island, which I personally consider as the peak of uniqueness. Such graphics will never get old, and will be considered great even after 30 years.\n\nAnd Tim Schafer, founder of Double Fine Productions, creator of games like Full Throttle, Grim Fandango, Brütal Legend, The Secret of Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge...well, I think we don't even need talk about him. An incredible talent, a total genius. A below-decent, and even an avarage story was out of question, all I've expected was pure amazingness, and he delivered just that! Bravo Tim...\n\nOnly problem with Broken Age is that, it is kind of too easy for someone familiar with this genre. Yet, it personally doesn't matter for me, since I'm not playing a point-and-click adventure for its ridiculously exaggeratively difficult puzzles (Not like I'm eliminating the ones which has that difficulty level. It just simply doesn't matter.), but for its fluent smart story with a good sense of humor. And, that's Broken Age!\n\nIn a nutshell, Double Fine did it again...\n\nBuy this game, buy this game and play it!\n\n----------\n\n(27.09.2014) EDIT:\n\nSo, I think I should've foresaw the 'Double Fine incident' with Spacebase DF-9, and write my Broken Age review accordingly, huh. Suddenly, I started getting a dozen of downvotes (from %90 rate, to %50), and many people adding, just to state that my review is faulty, and Double Fine is a scammer company. Seriously?\n\nFirst of all, that is NOT a company review, that is a GAME REVIEW. I really don't care who created a game, as long as the game is good, despite the fact that I've praised Double Fine in my review. It was just to clarify that good visuals, sounds, and scenario, is not a coincidence, because that they've done it before. How should I've known that would happen?\n\nSecondly, Spacebase DF-9 incident is NOT a scam, even remotely. I'm not the one to teach you what kind of precautions spending your money will require, nor I'm not the one to teach you the definition of 'Early Access', but if you still feel confused about the concept, and raging at the same time, I'll suggest you to watch this:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyGbbIB5eaM\nSince releasing half of a game is also a type of early access, if you still be like "Broken Age part 2 is nowhere to be seen, too. They are clearly scamming all the way!", you would be wrong, again. If part 2 of Broken Age is never to come, that's also a risk that I myself have taken, and consequently my fault.\n\nAs a sidenote: I believe in Double Fine and Tim Schafer, you repugant people will surely have my regards when part 2 is out.\n\n----------\n\n(28.04.2015) EDIT:\n\nHah, take that.","July 16, 2014","true","16.6"," 55 of 98 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","55","98","0","1"

I'll update this when the full game is released.)\n\nBroken Age is definitely one of the more unique adventure games in recent years.To echo some of the other reviewers here, the game exudes charm. The art direction is exquisite and unique. Shafer's trademark humor is here, but it's understated. Below the humor there are weighty themes of independence and growing up, and I'm interested to see where it all goes (and not just because of the amazing ending!)\n\nDo not play this game for its puzzles. They are simplistic and not very satisfying to complete. (On the upside, this means the game avoids "adventure game logic--you will not be combining a string of objects in an illogical fashion). I hope Part II manages to make you feel clever, while at the same time keeping the logic.\n\nMy other complaint is that I feel that at least so far, Shay and Vella aren't especially developed characters. Other than they want independence, we know very little about them. They're well-designed (with great voice acting), but they aren't fully realized yet. Part I is only around 3-4 hours, so this is somewhat understandable. And the ending paves the way for some...interesting...possibilities.\n\nPro tip: give the wrong objects to people. You will often get amusing, unique answers. Also, map the right-click button to the inventory. The interface was obviously designed for tablets, and while it works on PCs, the default mappings should be different.\n\nAs it stands, if you're interested in playing it, I would wait until the full game is released. I probably would've done that myself, but I wanted to continue to enjoy the (amazing) documentary as it releases.\n\n(Oh, and the music is VERY well done.)","January 17, 2014","true","15.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","2"

So if you're expecting a challenge, look elsewhere.\n\nIn all other ways, it lives up to expectations as a Tim Schafer game. The setting is adorable without being outright twee. The dual PC/split POV narrative has promise and some really fantastic bits (can't say more here without spoilers). The writing is never as outright hilarious as, say, a Monkey Island game, but it does stay consistently amusing throughout.\n\nAlso because of its pedigree, the gameplay is gratifyingly streamlined. As an example: in older games, getting from one side of the map to the other was a chore, consisting of watching your character amble along each screen. In this game, if you double click an in-room destination, the character will jog there. Double-click an exit and you warp to the next room immediately, bypassing the walk animation completely. This may be one reason the game is so much quicker to complete, but I'm a huge fan of the feature and others like it. Adventure games should be challenging, but never tedious.\n\nIs it worth full price? I received the game as a gift, so it's hard for me to say whether you will get $20 worth of fun out of it. But now that I'm hooked on the setting and story, I'll be picking up the rest of the game without a doubt.","February 27, 2014","true","6.2"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","12","17","0","1"

If the answer is "no", don't bother: you won't like this one either.

I laughed aloud countless times during my playthrough. Even the music and art style were spot on. However, you will most likely find yourself infuriated by some of the puzzles later on. If you're not the most patient individual in the world and a master of lateral thinking, get ready to look at walkthroughs. To me, consulting a walkthrough at least once or twice during a point-and-click is competely normal, but if you are the kind of person that considers it cheating or refuses to do so for some other reason, you're most likely going to get stuck multiple times during the later half of the game.","December 5, 2015","true","21.1"," 19 of 31 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","19","31","0","0"

Act One was phenomenal in almost every aspect, however, I feel like Act Two kind of dropped the ball.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics throughout the entire game were amazingly colorful and bright. Everything was pleasant to look at and really helped to bring the game to life.\n\nAudio:\nThe voice actors did a decent job with bringing out whatever emotion they could from the script. The music was complimentary to what ever was going on in the scene at the time and also helped to add to the excitement.\n\nStoryline:\nThe storyline throughout Act One was extremely well done. It gave an in depth sense of what was going on and why, and you knew exactly why you were doing the things you were. However, once you got into Act Two, the storyline almost seemed non existent. The puzzles became increasingly hard, almost to the point of wanting to give up, with very little clues to go on. For a good portion of the final Act, I spent a lot of time looking through walkthroughs just to be able to move on.\n\nEven though I enjoyed this game for the most part, I have a hard time recommending this game, based on the fact that Act Two left too much to be desired. I have more questions at the end of Act Two, then I did when I started it. There are still too many loose ends that have not been tied up.

It sounds as if I would have to play act 1 all over again just so I can understand stuff in act 2. And Act 2 doesn't sound worth it. So, yeah...\n\nThe awkward moment where steam tells you when you purchased the game, rather than when you last played... X(\n\nI bought this game without any prior knowledge of the kickstarter origins of Broken Age, and I feel that this title supports my arguement for NEVER backing a game through kickstarter, unless you like throwing money at something which may never happen. There is always a risk when giving money to someone for something that doesn't exist, and I think a lot of people have unrealistic expectations, and unfortunately in this case, it was the people making the game that didn't plan and budget ahead.\n\nI bought this game in a steam sale not long after it was offically realised, which was the best choice at the time, as I had heard a bit about the game and was excited to play it myself. I played through act 1 and expected a few months wait for act 2, as this is the norm with most multi-part titles. How wrong I was. Over a year later, I am still waiting for act 2. I can't imagine how annoyed people must be from backing this game from the start! However, the signs for problems ahead were there from the beginning.\n\nHaving only just bought the game, I started looking through sites to see if there was an expected release date for act 2, only to find an article which stated that the profits from act 1 meant they could go on and fund act 2. I was horrified! I had no idea that this game was not even funded for the second part. I had no idea that this game wasn't even supposed to be split into 2 acts in the first place. But I thought to myself, oh well, it might take a little bit longer but I can wait. Update after update, deadlines came and went for act 2 to be released. I think this is what really got to most people. The waiting wasn't the problem, it was the promises that were broken that made people upset and lose faith in Double Fine as a developer. How can you trust someone with your money if you don't believe they know what they are doing? If someone who has 30 years experience in the games industry can't budget for a full game, then we are all doomed! Unfortunately for us, its too late to take back our money or get back our trust. This is the true lesson to be learned from this experience: Research, research, research! If something looks too good to be true, then it probably is!\n\nI feel that some of the fault in my buying this game has to fall at Valve's door. The steam page for Broken Age is very misleading, as it gave me no indication at the time that this game is kickstarter funded and may never have been finished. And, even now, it is impossible to tell from the steam page that this game is not finished! This is why I have written this review, to give people the knowledge of the situation surrounding this game, so that someone else can make an informed choice over whether to purchase this game, I choice I didn't have.\n\nSo, I guess you want to know a bit about the game, huh? Other reviews can tell you more, but the basics are: It's a point and click adventure that follows two very different main characters, with the option to switch between characters whenever you wish. Its a pretty looking game, with amazing voice-acting and simple puzzles.\n\nIs it worth almost £20? No. Act 1 took me about 3 hours (I got stuck for about 30 minutes because I'm bad at video game logic :P), with act 2, if and when it appears, to take another 5 hours. I'm honestly not sure I will play act 2. It has been so long since I played act 1 that I will have to replay it all from scratch. And really, there are SO many other games I could be playing, I may never experience this game as it was supposed to be played. My advice: Wait until both acts are out and grab it in a sale. As the second act is currently not out, I cannot recommend this game to anyone.\n\nA real shame.","March 19, 2015","false","3.9"," 21 of 35 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","21","35","0","0"

I will probably play it again as soon as I have time. The art was well done. The dialogue was genius (as expected). The voice acting was better than I could have hoped for. The story... the story was hands down the best adventure game story I have ever encountered. I spent a good chunk of time today just thinking and wondering about different parts of the story, what they mean, and what will happen in Act II. When a game's story gets me to actively engage it even when I'm not playing, it's a damn good story. I am sitting here wishing I had Act II in my hands already because I want to know what happens.\n\nNow, the reason why it took me a little while to say this:\n\nI don't consider myself a genius when it comes to adventure games. I expected to get at least 5 hours out of Act 1. When I finished it in under 3 hours, having exhausted every dialogue option available along the way, I felt as though the puzzle difficulty should have been higher or that there should have just been more puzzles. I was honestly a little irate that somebody like Tim Schafer would make the game so easy, considering what he has done in the past.\n\nI currently still wish the difficulty had been a little higher, but I've started to understand why it wasn't.  Point & click adventures are known for their DEVIOUS puzzle design. When you're only playing a game puzzle to puzzle and getting stumped at every single one, it is more satisfying to solve them, but that satisfaction comes at the cost of the storytelling (which is and definitely should be the main focus any P&C adventure game). The purpose of the puzzles, however, is not just to make a story interactive. The best designed puzzles give you little nuggets of the story while presenting an interactive, stimulating challenge. Not every puzzle in Broken Age did this, but a lot of them did. If this quality makes for less contrived, more logical and consequently easier puzzles, then so be it. A great example of this is the "use spoon with cereal" bit that, on the surface, seems overtly mundane. My advise, should you choose to play this game, is to think about why some seemingly mundane actions are there. Also, it think the game is very much meant to flip back-and-forth between the two stories, so I would recommend switching after every major "happening" you encounter. I'd also recommend starting with Shay's story.\n\nThanks for reading, and I hope you choose to enjoy this fantastic game.","January 29, 2014","true","12.8"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","2"

Monkey Island is by far my fav. point and click adventure game and overall love all his work.\nI got this game through the kickstarter which got me extremely excited when I heard he is making a new adventure game, especially since he has 100% full creative control, no publishers.. AWESOME!\n\nThat being said, this is a good game... It's slightly below my expectations, I don't consider it to be AMAZING, however I do think it's fairly good.\n\nI've been following their documentary that covers the development of the game and since I also am a game developer I fully understand (and I was expecting) that they ran into financial and deadline problems. Especially for a point and click game where you have to basically build the engine yourself if you want anything decent, since it's an unpopular genre nowadays.\n\nThe game has small problems here and there like various depth issues when it comes to certain animations, and also the game was dropping frames for me when I was using an item to interact with something. (Keep in mind that I'm playing this before it's officially out on steam, so they will probably fix these problems by then)\n\n\nAll those problems don't affect the experience, however I don't feel like the experience comes anywhere close to Monkey Island or Grim Fandango. That's probably just me being nostalgic.. or playing too many games and being desensitized.\n\nBut if you are a Tim Schafer fan or just a point and click adventure genre fan, this is worth getting. It's an old genre game with beautiful graphics. I say in the end, it's worth it.\n","January 25, 2014","true","134.6"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","1"

The puzzles are extremely easy, it is more about searching each scene thouroughly and pushing the story forward than solving anything, the story itself isnt particularly engaging, and this is quite problematic when it comes to adventures games since the story is the heart of the game and genre.\n\nIt can be an ok experience for most, but do not expect a memorable one, not by a longshot,\nVoice acting is good, visuals are just ok.

The soundtrack is amazing and also the dubbing with several celebrities (Elijah Wood, Jack Black, Wil Wheaton and others). The story is pretty interesting and I enjoyed revealing it bit by bit, playing some time as Shay and then as Vella, it's useful when you get stuck on a puzzle to switch to the second charater.\nAs I hoped the second part took me longer to beat and overall Steam says that I played the game about 15 hours, I took my time, although the actual time should be a bit less it's still a nice amount, the average time to beat should be about 10.5 hours or so.\n\nAnd for the bad:\nI kinda hoped there would be a bit more to the story and somwhere in part 2 I could guess where it goes.\nMost of the puzzles where fine but there were a couple of kinda hard to guess puzzles that really took me time to figure out, one of which was a really bad choice in my opinion and I'm sure that many players got stuck in that place, it was kinda annoying and I decided to use a guide just for that one puzzle (still not sure if I'de get that one without it! they needed to add some kind of hint there, I was just clueless on what I needed to do next and wandered around the screens looking for a hint).\nAlso some puzzles were a bit tiring (fetching things, going from one place to another and back again several times etc'), mostly on act 2.\n\nTo sum it up, as I said I enjoyed the game overall, I'm happy that we got the game but indeed it could have been a bit better, the first part was shorter and easier but more interesting and fun to play. Still if you like adventure point and click games you should give this game a try, I thought it was worth the 15$ I paid for it, but you can get it on sale for much less (lowest so far was 6.24$).\nI hope Tim will be up to the task of creating another original P&C game in the future, we need more of those! :)","February 26, 2014","true","15.9"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

Tim Schafer has done it again.\n\nBroken Age is an enjoyable point-and-click adventure with the right mix of character dialog, puzzles, and humor.  This all leads into decent character development throughout the game, and sets up the ending of this First Act perfectly.\n\nThe dynamic of shifting between the stories of two characters worked well throughout the game.  The two stories were balanced in terms of content, and I really didn't favor one over the other.  While it's important to play and appreciate both stories you aren't forced to switch throughout most of the game.  This allows the player to enjoy each story and character independently, and not be arbitrarily ripped out of the experience.  I enjoyed being able to switch between the stories when I wanted to, without consequences.\n\nAnd the ending of this First Act?  I won't spoil it, but it's brilliantly executed and memorable.  It certainly makes me look forward to Act Two.  As far as which story to finish first, I will say that I finished Shay's story first and found the ending very profound.  It was truly an 'OMG' moment where the two stories merge, and suddenly everything makes sense and shocks you at the same time.  Please take your time and enjoy both stories before you get to the ending, as you'll appreciate the results.\n\nI highly recommend Broken Age to both fans of point-and-click adventures and first-timers.  Tim Schafer and Double Fine have delivered a high-quality experience that is well worth the money.","February 13, 2014","true","2.8"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

But if anything, the added scope and possibility that exploded out of their hugely successful Kickstarter has only amplified their talents as a developer, giving birth to what seems easily capable of becoming the game that defines them as a studio.\n\nBut playing Broken Age, there’s never the sense that Double Fine has grown beyond the quirky, commercially unviable studio that I’ve loved for years. Broken Age as a game, is exceptionally simple and humble in its construction. It’s unmistakably a product of its creator: esoteric, humorous, and at times even a bit profound, but without the often rough mechanics and invisible cage of possibilities that shackled most of the studio’s prior games. It’s Double Fine in their purest, most unrestrained form, and if you’ve played anything the studio’s made I doubt I have to tell you how exciting that is.\n\nIt’s somewhat precarious to attempt to discuss Broken Age’s plot, both for fear of spoilers and for the fact it’s only half finished, but its themes are so strong and its writing on point that it’s deserving of more than a minor conversation. It follows the dual stories of Vella and Shay, two people stuck in vastly different situations but united by their shared lack of freedom, forced to blindly conform to the traditions and expectations of those older than them, unable to even question “why?”.\n\nShay is the sole human aboard a ship intended as humanity’s last chance at finding a new planet they can call home. Trapped in an endless isolation, he lives out his days following his computer mom’s orders, still treated as a child ignorant to anything outside his daily routine and sheltered existence.\n\nVella in contrast is a member of a village whose traditions dictate the sacrifice of several young women to the towering Mog Chathra during their annual maiden feast, or otherwise doom them all to its wrath. Vella is the sole person brave enough to propose they fight the beast, but is shrugged off as a silly girl who doesn’t understand the gravity of the situation.\n\nThese two plotlines fold into each other to form Broken Age’s main themes of rejecting the systematic lives their characters are placed in, and being brave enough to discover the world for themselves. It’s rebellion without anarchy; breaking out to find who you are, not out of distaste of the world, but a desire to make it better if only you’d be given the ability to think and act for yourself.\n\nYou could label Broken Age a coming of age story (in fact it itself does), but it’s so much more sincere than I feel that commonly implies. Its characters are delightful and lively and often absurd, but also fully developed in how they fit within their world. They fully embody their roles and proclaim them so effectively that it felt like I knew the people I was talking to, as if they had somehow taken on a life outside of the game. Even characters you see in only a single scene or who are given but a few lines of dialogue have so much personality and heart in their interactions that they transcend their small part into the larger world of the game.\n\nDouble Fine has always been a developer recognized for brilliant writing and characterization, but I’ve never felt as immersed in the worlds they created or as invested in their characters as with Broken Age. As bizarre as their circumstances become, I connected with Shay and Vella’s plight for freedom of their parental and societal shackles, and was as curious as them upon entering a new area and meeting its peculiar inhabitants.\n\nFor all I know act two could be a complete disaster. It could cause Broken Age to go down as one of the most disappointing games in recent memory and probably cause even me to think twice before checking out anything Double Fine puts out in the future. But for now, it’s sublime, beautiful, expertly pinned, and not afraid to wear its heart on its sleeve. As a huge fan of all things Double Fine, I’m finding it hard not to readily declare this their best work yet, which I consider no small praise.\n\nAct II Update & Conclusion\nPerhaps I expected too much.\n\nIt’s been more than a year since the first part of Double Fine’s Kickstarted nest egg first release, and since then the anticipation, unease, and in some cases legitimate anger have been steadily increasing to levels that beg the question just what this game means to people. It was one of the first hugely successful examples of using Kickstarter to fund games, as well as a callback to Double Fine’s earliest work and easily their biggest and most ambitious game in a long time (despite hav ing began as something far smaller). It was hard not to want to continuously give them the benefit of the doubt; to let them give it their all and assume Broken Age would come out the better for it however long it took. But for all the hype and impossible dreams of what Broken Age might be, we might have taken it too far. Or maybe Broken Age took it too far, and in my naive enthusiasm I went along with it. [...]\n\nFinal Word\nI said at the end of my act one write-up that I could see Broken Age being the game that defines Double Fine. I still think that to be true, but unfortunately it isn’t as glamorous an image as I had first imagined it to be. Broken Age isn’t a bad game, nor do I regret playing it or wish to advise others not to. It’s impossible to ignore though just how uneven and weird the first and second act are. Broken Age seems to reflect a lot on its extended development and the detriment its model of funding and community feedback may have had on it. It began with an eagerness you couldn’t escape and the feeling that this couldn’t be anything but an amazing, and yet by the end it has lost a lot of its drive. It’s tired and drained, seeking to provide closure for those who have been waiting so long, but being unable to do much more.\n\nSadly I've reached the character limit for Steam reviews. If you want to read my full thoughts on act II and Broken Age as a whole you can find them on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","February 21, 2015","true","12.1"," 130 of 244 people (53%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","53","130","244","3","0"

If you grew up playing and loving the classic LucasArts and Sierra adventure games, this will be right up your alley. And if you didn't? Well, then you're in for a treat! The humour throughout is spot on, and I found myself smiling or laughing at nearly every turn and every conversation. The extraordinary Double Fine feeling eminates from beginning to end,  and the story will most likely captivate you and leave you guessing where it's going to head next.\n\nBroken age is yet enother example of the amazing and peerless work that Double Fine keeps producing, and it definitely gets close to the level of quality that they have produced in the past, including their own Psychonauts as well as games from their LucasArts days like Grim Fandango and Monkey Island. The puzzles in the game never reach the absurd levels that the old classics could achieve, but I did run into a handfull of headscratchers along the playthrough. The good part was the ability to switch between the two characters if I got stuck, or wanted a change of perspective in the story, very similar to the mechanic from Day of the Tentacle.\n\nOverall, I can't recommend this game enough, it is a masterpiece in the genre, and it's only half-done!

If you're a fan of the point-and-click adventure games of old (LucasArts games coming to mind immediately, as well as The Longest Journey), Broken Age is worth playing. The game doesn't have the length that some of the old ones had (assuming Act 2 is roughly the same length as Act 1), though that may be largely due to the puzzles being a little more logical than those in the older games were, so you spend less time aimlessly clicking on the environment and trying to use random items with each other in hopes of finding a solution, and more time enjoying the stylized art, amusing dialog, and interesting world.\n\nIs it a good game? Yes, perhaps even if the adventure genre isn't normally your cup of tea. Is it worth $25?

I switched back and forth between shay and vella after they reached major points in their respective stories, so for sure saw the ending coming from preeeettttyyy far off. theres a lot of good points but i also have like, i guess, some issues.  lets discuss.\n\nartistically this game is amazing. every area you go to is beautifully rendered and the characters actually have a nice highlight layer that respects lights located throughout the level, so even though its technically 2D they still feel like they navigate a 3D world in a way that is subtle and convincing.  all the characters had a great feel, and each area you went to had a clear artistic theme that worked well and created a good identity for the individual characters and the world itself.  Each village Vella visited had a great sense of fashion that reflected their purpose in the world, and in Shay’s case he just had a whole bunch of amazing everything friends to hang out with.  That being said there are a few places where i noticed the assets looks pixelated and improperly rezzed, but it was infrequent and it was never an object that was important to the story.\n\nthe sounds design was great.  the music was very well done, and the variety of voice actors was pretty impressive and full of wonderful and recognizable people who really did an awesome job of selling their characters.\n\nThe characters were also great. Shay’s friends were are hilarious and the way they interacted with him when on and off duty was entertaining.  The people in Vella’s world were also pretty interesting, although they all blindly love Mog Chothra which would get old if not for it being an integral part of the story, so i guess i don’t mind? It kinda bugged me that all the female characters in Shellmound were super ditzy and shallow though.  This could have been subverted by making one of the temple guards a dude, as their shallow nature ends up being a gag, but all the girls who were offered to mog chothra and the two temple guards kinda just blend together.\n\nthe gameplay was pretty standard point and click stuff, and the puzzles themselves were rarely very challenging. to be fair i’ve played point and click adventures for like, my entire life as a gamer, so these things are kinda second nature to me. there were some design choices that were a little strange - like the snake. why is the snake there? it is a dead end and misleading. there was no reason to get past the snake, and as far as i coudl tell, no way to get past the snake. why is there a snake?\n\nthe story itself was pretty interesting, and how the two stories come together is pretty obvious, but i cant fault the game for not surprising me with it’s plot twists.  Shay’s story is interesting because it all happens in a very small scale - he explores the ship to do a thing.  Vella, on the other hand, goes on this big winding adventure around her world (but really only like 3 locations).  Her story seems like a race against time, while shay’s seems far more casual and meandering.\n\noverall though my biggest complaint is in the story.  it took me three hours to beat the game, and at the end of those three hours the story gets interesting.  the whole game is building up to this specific point (which again, is pretty easy to see coming if you like, you know, know how stories work) and when it finally happens the game ends. imagine, dear reader, that you are watching star wars, and just as luke gets on board the millenium falcon the credits roll.  Technically, yeah, you know luke is like off on an adventure, and leia needs to be rescued but NOPE. you’ll find out about it later.\n\nI know that tim put out an apology for making the game too long and how he wanted to release SOMETHING because its been what, 2 years since the kickstarter? and so the game was split in two parts so we can play half now and half later.  but to me, this felt like maybe 1/3? speaking from my other P&C adventure experience: telltale games released a new season of sam and max every 2 years. each contain 5 episodes that take roughly 3 hours on the first play through - about the same size and substance as part 1 of broken age. they also cost the same amount of money. for 5 episodes released every month, instead of 2 released i guess like 6 months apart? they haven’t really been clear on when more is coming.\n\ni know each studio has its own way of creating games and i’m not trying to say double fine should have made me more game, but i just feel like in 2 years and with 3 million dollars i was going to get something a little more substantial.\n\nbroken age is pretty good. it didn’t blow me away, but i enjoyed playing it. i look forward to part 2, whenever that gets finished  but like, if i am being honest, i enjoyed it more for the art and acting than i did for the game parts. the old lucas arts adventure games were challenging and engaging and really shaped my sense of humor and love for adventurous stories. the dig and monkey island will be with me the rest of my life because they impacted me in a big way.  act 1 of broken age is not memorable or impactful in the same way.  so i’m looking forward to episode 2. because episode 1 is great, but pretty forgettable.","January 17, 2014","true","3.9"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

An interesting world with some fun moments, but overall a bit of a mediocre adventure game; one of the stories had pacing problems, and the other had serious structural and character motivation problems. Finally I managed to push through and was pleasantly surprised by the excellent ending to Act 1.\n\nIt was on the strength of that ending (and a kind of masochistic pig-headedness) that I played through Act 2, which is a complete DISASTER. The puzzles are obtuse and nonsensical in the worst tradition of bad adventure games. The mechanism of switching back and forth between story lines to gain information is ridiculous in a story where the two characters cannot communicate (What, are they telepathic?). There's an entire elaborate multi-stage puzzle sequence where your progress can be completely reset by doing things in the wrong order.\n\nThis wouldn't be so bad if we had a goal, or some sort of logical progression of steps to be following, but for much of the second act I honestly couldn't have explained to you what the characters were trying to accomplish or why what I was doing would in any way help. This culminates in a series of actions that every piece of information you have indicates will lead to your horrible and gruesome death, without actually gaining anything meaningful.\n\nA pointless, stupid, and frustrating experience.

Fortunately that hasn't happened, and Act 1 of Broken Age is the most fun I've had playing a game designed by Tim Shafer since the last one I played! It's a beautiful game in every respect, the art and animation is wonderful, the music is of the highest standard, and the voice acting is excellent without exception. Really, as a demonstration of what a modern adventure game can be, there's no finer example. It's mildly amusing throughout, with a couple of laugh out loud moments. The puzzles aren't particularly challenging, although I did get modestly stumped a couple of times, having to come back the next day before the solution presented itself. Frankly, that's about my speed, but I still hope Act 2 is a little more challenging. Even if it isn't I would have had a great time. Overall a great success then, as far as I'm concerned.

The short length could have meant ABSOLUTELY NOTHING and be absolutely doubly-fine... if not for cut-down tablet-style gameplay, where the most fun part of questing is absent.\n\nThis means: "poking around and performing a lot of available actions to achieve an initially non-obvious goal (to get closer to bigger goal)" VS. "clicking around to find a SINGLE next action that will nudge the game to reveal next single action".\n\nSo gameplay disappointed me a little. I was very surprised to see that I finished it in 3,5 hours, despite clicking on everything and trying to milk every line of dialogue and funny interaction.\n\n==The long version:==\nAny praises for this game could not be more spot on: the sophistication and delivery simply knocks out anyone who has ever seen an animated film, played a quest game or read a good story. In any aspect, this is an artistic triumph. Nevertheless, there are some nagging questions behind the excitement of discovery and heart-pounding plot realizations: namely, does Broken Age succeed as a game? Sadly, this is not so clear-cut.\n\nEvery location is a stunning gallery of quirky characters and beautiful backgrounds. But each time, there are only one to four active objects on-screen, and only one way to solve the one puzzle that game feeds you at the moment. The gameplay is, sadly, as straight as an arrow and as bare as a plank. Even if you think and fantasize about how the objects may interact and what it could mean for the characters and NPCs, it ultimately boils down to trial-and-error, simply because there are so few options. Meaning, you are better off sticking everything into everything, because it will take less time than figuring out the answer. No matter how good the story and setup, the actual gameplay is to exhaust dialogue options in any order without a chance of failure, then combine two objects, then repeat.\n\nIt may seem like a normal quest experience, but there are good reference points: content-wise, Broken Age Act 1 amounts to about 2 chapters of Curse of Monkey Island. Gameplay-wise, it is less than one (and one of the shortest at that). Curse of Monkey Island had six. Moreover, you can't perform various actions on objects or people, so every step is reduced to one try; one line to make a joke; one obstacle. Whereas classic LucasArts quests were, essentially, a search for a hidden action among the multitude of highly entertaining failures to act. You literally get less bang (trademark Schafer humor, which is still hilarious) for your buck.\n\nSo in the end, you fly through very rich and insanely beautiful locations with no time to appreciate or explore them and make mistakes - like you're watching a cool animated show. The locations are packed with possibilities - but the only ones available are the ones you MUST utilize to move the plot along.\n\nThe "length issue" is even more sad because of the 2nd part of Velle's quest. I say it this time from a perspective of a writer.\n\n****SPOILERS****\nThe Meriloft section does nothing to the plot, and doesn't change the character in any way - it's just an interlude to get from Sugar Bunting to Shellmound. It's crazy good looking and ripe with plot possibilities (at the very least, the mystery of the cloud prophet/charlatan who (maybe?) duped these people into his religion). But inside Act 1, it doesn't mean anything at all. It's all the more obvious when you play both characters intermittently: I finished Shay's part (basically a single-part affair) while Velle was in Meriloft, and then he lay unconscious while Vella was getting through Merriloft and then got to actually move the plot in Shellmound. So it's 1 or 2-part vs 3-part (where the middle part is disposable). Again, Meriloft is rad - it's just sad that it doesn't matter much (maybe it will matter more in Act 2? still applies though).\n****END****\n\nAnyway, Broken Age still kicks ♥♥♥ and is gorgeous. I sincerely recommend it to EVERYONE, not only nostalgic quest players. This includes people who have kids. And maybe especially them. Kids will be super-grateful for this when they grow up. And for a reason.","January 31, 2014","true","4.2"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liorean/recommended/232790/","liorean","liorean","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liorean/","1129 products in account","Broken Age Act 1 is a beautiful adventure game where you follow two different people in storylines that feel quite different to each other. It's got an art style that feels quite unique, the voice acting is on the level of Shiny's Sacrifice - in other words high profile names doing their best quality voice acting giving their personas a very distinct character. The story is really well written and funny, and the world adds to that - there are also lots of hilarious things about both the environments and small side things happening.\n\nShay's story is like a teenager stuck in a spaceship where the computer treats him like he was still three years old, and the environments are full of props to that effect. Also, lots of things seems to be vowen, knitted of crocheted, like the yarn buddies, the arms of the computer, the warping effect when travelling in space, the present, the weaver etc. It's also quite heavily lampshaded. The story does a good work of giving the feeling that you as a character are bored and need to find a way to get out of the grudge while still not boring you as the player. It also gives you a great feeling of wanting to be doing something to help others.\n\nVella's story is the tale of a girl who is chosen as sacrifice to a monster to save the village, but who instead wants to fight the monster. The setting is such that nobody except her grandfather sees anything wrong with the sacrifice, instead seeing being sacrificed being a great honour, but you can see in it moments of despair about losing daughters or those daughters dying while still being an honourable sacrifice. The setting is more a renaissance faire with some fantastic elements to it, and a good lot of humourous dialogue.\n\nWhat is the game missing? Well, in the LucasArts games of old, you generally had tasks like Monkey Island's sword fighting puzzle, where you first had to do an item quest, then you had to do a collection of lines, to eventually beat the Sword Master. It felt like you were actually achieving something by solving it. There were also moments in the game where you got stuck for a while and had to search for a solution, trying to figure the puzzle out. In here, the solutions are always really close by the problem, and there is no procedure to figure out you need to go through to solve it. There was not a single puzzle that made me stop and actually think about how to solve it, everything was obvious from the outset. The good thing about it though is that there is no pixel hunting, no missing items far away and having to backtrack, no banging your head on the table in frustration of not being able to get past a point and eventually dropping the game in frustration.\n\nDespite those faults, the first act is storywise about as great as any point'n'click game has ever been, in looks, dialogue, humour and music it's spot on. The game throws a few screwballs at you, and I feel that depending on your game play order you will get a very different experience. If you play Shay's story first then Vella's story, you will suddenly get a shocking reveal that casts your actions in Shay's story in a very different light. If you play Vella's story first you will at the end of Shay's story get a different screwball where you at the end suddenly realise that an assumption you will probably make in her story's later part was dead on wrong, but not the shock of the reveal about your actions as Shay. If you switch characters at natural boundaries, and this is probably best done with playing Shay first, then switching when quest giver changes to Marek, and for Vella changing between Sugar Bunting and Merriloft, then Shay for the linear quests given by Marek, then Vella changing after escaping Merriloft, then play Shay to the end, then finally Vella to the end. The big picture of the story will be revealed way earlier, but it will not have any great reveals. It ends with a great cliffhanger that makes you really anticipate the second act.\n\nIf you wonder about the inspirations for the story, Tim Schafer has pointed to 1948 story The Lottery by Shirley Jackson, with a spoiler warning if you read it.\n\n\nOver all, it's a very good and humorous story experience, if you're a lore fan you will probably really get into the game, but if you're looking for hard thinking nuts to consider, the puzzles of the first act will not give you full satisfaction, but I think you will have a hard time finding somebody that played the first act that is not eagerly anticipating the second act.\n\n\n\nA warning though: Don't view any let's plays of this game, or you will spoil it utterly.","February 11, 2014","true","21.6"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","11","17","0","0"

What's worse is that unsolicited hints come in like crazy, treating the player like a kid. I'd compare the gameplay to some of Telltale Games' easier fare (Wallace & Gromit, Back to the Future), but with the hint system on.\n\nSecondly, the good; and there is a lot of that. This is a beautiful game. It's 2D, it animates like a flash game, but man is it the most gorgeous, eye-popping flash game out there. I've seen a lot of Lead Artist "Bagel" Stapley's work for Broken Age in documentaries, but seeing it so crisp and clear in the game does his talent justice. The animations are also very fluid and charming, despite the limited technology.\n\nIn terms of story, it was also one hand or the other. The story of Shay, the boy protagonist, feels a bit dreary and uninspired - which may be unfair considering he was trying to escape a dreary and uninspiring situation. However, playing Vella, the female protagonist was a treat through and through. Great scenes, great characters, great situations. It's like the game saved most of the great bits for this half. Broken Age Part 1 also ends in an unexpected cliffhanger that still continues to have me wonder what happened and what's going to happen next. I can't wait to play Part 2, which is a good sign that I enjoyed the game despite the few issues I had.\n\nIn short, this is a game for those who are really into story, and will forgive gameplay that is almost condescendingly easy. If that's you - it's definitely me - then I highly recommend this game.","January 17, 2014","true","14.5"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","12","19","0","2"

The Writing is Double-fine quality: Great writing with bits of humor thrown around.\n\nThe Gameplay is what you come to expect from a point and click adventure game. click to walk around, Item Inventory to use for puzzles, etc. Nothing truly groundbreaking but compared to old 90s point and clicks like Day of the tentacle and Sam & max the interface is way better. It serves it's purpose well. Would say it feels better than the recent telltale games.\n\n\nThe Puzzles have a sense of logic to them, they arn't Phoenix-Wright/Ghost Trick style Logic-Leaping but it isn't  "Fit round object into round slot" easy.\n\nThe Voice acting is really well done. it is easily the highest quality part of the game. Nothing felt out of place and nothing got annoying to me.\n\nThe Characters are great too, From the crazy cloud people to the Blind Guardians of the Dead Eye God. Even the Hipster lumberjack (now named Curtis) which was made fun of early in development is funny.\n\nThe Soundtrack is great for what it does, but it's not something i would loop on my Music player when im not playing.\n\n\nThe art style is beautiful. I Pressed the screenshot button alot to get some desktop wallpaper out of it.\n\nIt's quite obvious that the ending part was slapped together quickly because it randomly became a two part series in development, But i can't wait for part 2. Don't want to spoil anything.\n\nI would recommend buying it. If you have a longing for a classic point and click adventure or want something like the Telltale Sam and Max Games i would get it. Though if your expecting something like the Walking dead or Wolf Among Us with ~~choices~~ and stuff like that don't get it.\n\n\n\nalso, it got me to write a review thats more than two sentences, it's that good.","January 14, 2014","true","4.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It does not overfill your inventory, and it has Jack Black in it (briefly).\n\nThe bad is that the story gradually fell apart because you see so little about the real antagonists, and we all know the story was contrived to suit the split gameplay, not to mention the badly split development schedule.\n\nThe game is almost a 10 anyway, and probably would have been if they had developed it all at once and I had played it all at once.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/recommended/232790/","drmircow","Dr. Mircow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/drmircow/","677 products in account","Broken Age is an old-school point-and-click adventure game funded through Kickstarter purely by nostalgia from fans that grew up with LucasArts games from the ‘90s along with Tim Schafer’s earlier works. For a very long time, Broken Age was Kickstarter’s poster-boy, all thanks to being the most funded project at the time. This meant that one small slip could potentially affect the way people perceive the risky-environment of Kickstarter projects in general. No wonder there was high pressure on Double Fine to deliver on their promises since they received almost $4 million in funding (which is almost nothing by today’s standards if it were funded by an actual publisher) in contrast to the $400,000 they were originally asking. The end result was split over two Acts, released approximately a year and half apart from each other.\n\nWith that said, what Double Fine delivered in the end is a wonderful adventure game with an interesting plot concept: a teenager by the name of Shay who is a prisoner in his own spaceship trying to escape from being babysit by computers he refers to “Mom” and “Dad”; and Vella, daughter of a family of bakers in a village who tries to oppose taking part in a traditional sacrifice to Mog Chathra, a creature known for devouring worlds. Two teenagers living in two different worlds, yet facing almost similar problems, eventually collide with one another. Although the story starts agonisingly slow, it eventually builds up momentum after two or so hours in and keeps you invested until the totally unexpected, nonetheless remarkable, plot twist near the end of the first act which makes up for any pacing issues encountered. I really dig the concept Broken Age is trying to follow here.\n\nAdditionally, compliments are to be given to the charming art-style. It is simply startling, albeit childish -- but that is its beauty, right? In fact, that is part of the story’s undertones. Sure, perhaps being an adult playing this might look silly, but from an artistic perspective it succeeds in capturing the aesthetics of a children’s storybook. It may not be what some people were expecting Broken Age to look like when the game was first pitched on Kickstarter, but I have no problems with it because Double Fine have done it very creatively. Likewise, while the humour might not be as memorable as in other comedy-oriented adventure games, Broken Age does not disappoint in this aspect either, all thanks to a couple of support characters such as the cutlery collective - the Spoon, the Fork and the Knife – whose dialogues and remarks never seize to be amusing. Throughout its duration, there are a handful of good chuckles to be had from time to time. Conceivably, I do not believe it was necessary for Double Fine to hire Hollywood actors as voice actors, but in the end they all did a solid job in most parts. Whilst there are minor moments where there might lack of emotion in the delivery of some of the lines, they do not break the immersion the game has to offer. And once again, Pete McConnell does a fantastic job on the soundtrack for this game, especially the three stellar tracks “The Lumberjack’s Cabin”, “Vella Wakes” and “Battle At Shellmound”.\n\nIf you read up to this point, then surely you may be wondering why I gave a negative review for something which, based on my comments above, sounds like an amazing point-and-click adventure game? Well, here is why, and it does actually break my heart to say it but:\n\nAct 2 ruined it all.\n\nPretty much everything that is established in Act 1 is thrown out the window. The things we, as players, are to believe judging by how the story unravels in Act 1 simply do not materialise in the second half. In fact, the whole concept seems detached in places in Act 2. As far as the story is concerned, it becomes uninteresting and seems to go almost nowhere. Any new revelation either turns out predictable or unimpressive. And this may be due to a few major flaws which simply killed Act 2.\n\nThe most obvious crime committed here is the reuse of the same exact locations found in Act 1, with only Shay’s spaceship being “redecorated”. To me, one aspect of adventure games which sucks me in is the notion of exploration; finding new locations and meeting new interesting characters to advance the plot, aside from solving challenging puzzles. Desolately, that is not the case here. Simple as. In reality, what bothers me the most might not actually be the reuse of the same locations in the end, but rather all the fetching for items. In this part of the game, it did not click with me because it is a chore. But hold on a second, fetching for stuff has been in adventure games like this for decades? Yes, but the problem here is when you ultimately realise that most support characters are nothing more than “mechanical” characters. Paying close attention, almost none of them have any influence over nor take direct part in the story. They only exist there artificially for either Shay or Vella to retrieve a specific item from them to solve a certain puzzle. So this makes you stop investing time in caring for them, as characters. Also in regards to the puzzles, Act 1 is indeed a breeze for adventure veterans, so it is almost impossible to get stuck at any point – which in a way I do not think that is necessarily a bad thing at all. All puzzles, although pretty obvious, feel logical in Act 1. On the other hand, Act 2 bumps up the difficulty and takes some risks in being creative with some of the puzzles, but the end result is a mixed bag. Contrary to what other people say, I give Double Fine credit for the wiring puzzle in terms of creativity because it actually made you think (and no, it is not as hard as some people claim it to be – just time consuming). I only wish it was not as frequently used in the last quarter of the game and more intuitive, but stuff like the snake puzzle was badly implemented; waiting for a puzzle to solve itself? But yeah, most puzzles in Broken Age basically boil down to asking the right person for the right item and that is you more or less done. Sort of.\n\nComparing the two acts, it feels like Act 2 was either rushed or made up while they were going along (as in it was not planned out at the same time with Act 1), or both. The charm and humour are still intact in the second half, but everything in terms of plot, characters, concept and some puzzles took a major hit by some bad design choices. Plus, just when you think Act 2 would redeem itself by the end, Broken Age ends in an anticlimax which raises more questions than providing all the answers. Simply put, the writing is poor in Act 2, and it seems like poor management could have been another factor here.\n\nIn conclusion, Broken Age is a visually beautiful and well-crafted game where all the passion was clearly injected a lot more in the first act, but all its potential is completely ruined by its second act plagued by poor writing and some bad design choices which reduces it to no more than an adequate adventure game at best. Broken Age could have been the next big thing in this genre, and Act 1 is a valid gauge, but when modern adventure games like The Book of Unwritten Tales or even the more retro-y Blackwell series (as a whole) exist and provide a (subjectively) better and more fleshed out experience, then you know that something went wrong at some point in your game. Broken Age is still worth at least one shot thanks to its promising Act 1, so long as you lower your expectations in the next act. If so, then this still is a good starter for anyone new who wants to delve into point-and-click adventure games. Otherwise, for old adventure fanatics, I cannot really recommend it; easily skippable thanks to Act 2. To be honest, I could have also easily given this a neutral review if there were such a button on Steam.\n\nI am still looking forward to Double Fine’s next project, but what a bummer coming from Tim Schafer.","May 25, 2015","false","10.9"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","1"

A good setup for a story that starts out strong but turns out to be quite a mess in both character’s cases. Either lackluster or just completely stupid twists thrown in for good measure.\n-Completely simple puzzle solution that most people probably won’t even want to think about. Use everything with everything wins the day here; and even then it is just way too easy to advance.\n-Really bad, sometimes grotesque humor. Characters seem to try to be funny, but fail miserably most of the time. While some lines are worth a few chuckles, this does not come even close to some of the amazing writing and humor of other games of the genre like Sam and Max or the Monkey Island series.\n-Short. Very short.\n-Just really bland characters in general. Some of them can be entertaining, some of them even memorable, but most of the time you will just get thrown more and more characters onto your face without them having any sort of character development, interesting traits, stories, or anything else that would make them stand out.\n\nThe good:\n-If you like how point-and-clicks work, this is a fairly clean UI that works well.\n-Graphics are interesting, but obviously might not be for everyone’s taste. It has a unique art style though, and is visually interesting, so that should be noted.\n-Voice acting is mostly really good.\n-The atmosphere, especially at the beginning of the game, is really well presented. The game might make you feel uneasy, and even if it doesn’t, it presents its world very well at the start. Sadly, this somewhat falls off as the story progresses, and by the time you hit the end of Act 1, you will notice that the best part of the game was actually the beginning.\n\nIn general, it is a game that is hard to recommend to anyone. Horrifyingly short, quite silly mess of a story, uninteresting characters for the most part and just a lack of anything great besides the interesting art style and good voice acting make this a game that only die-hard fans of the genre or Tim Schafer’s games should check out. The rest might want to wait for a sale or just skip it completely.","February 28, 2014","false","4.0"," 11 of 18 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","11","18","0","0"

Play Psychonauts and Grim Fandango instead.\n\nP.S.:  If Act 2's development makes a 180 degree turn and ends up being awesome by not repeating Act 1's more egregious mistakes, I will happily eat my shoe and give credit where it's due.","March 10, 2014","false","6.7"," 15 of 26 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","15","26","0","0"

For example, Shay has lived most of his life in a daycare prison ship, and he clearly wants out to experience something new. When he does get out, he basically goes "Sweet, I'm outside." and that's it. Any emotional response from the two characters is nonexistent in Act 2. The ending of the game is bland and unsatisfying.

This game manages to capture that emotional chord.  I'm sure kids will love it, but there's something special about the story that will draw in adults and make you feel something.\n\nThe scenes are gorgeous, as is the music.  Controles are simple, and the puzzles are challenging enough without forcing you to figure out, say, how to connect your chicken to a pulley.  If you're a point and click puzzle adventure afficionato, this game will be easy.\n\nReading some of the negative reviews, I'm surprised how much dislike there is for part two.  Personally, I really enjoyed getting to revisit locations as they change and watching the two main characters get to know each other indirectly.  The puzzles got harder in part two, but given how easy they are in part one, that's not a bad thing.  You get to see all the characters you've met earlier change, develope, and grow.\n\nIn terms of plot, the one thing I wish would have been changed was part one.  I felt like there wasn't really time to establish Vella's character the way there was for Shay.  I had a very strong sense of who Shay was as a person in part one, but since Vella's story was so driven by her adversity to the obstacles around her, it wasn't really until part two that I began to get a sense of her personality beyond being willing to stand up for herself.  It would have been nice to have her do some small puzzle unconnected to the maiden's feast to define her personality to the player, before her adventure started.\n\nI'll admit also I bought this on sale, so I didn't mind so much that it was short.  (I took my time and it lasted about 14 hours.)  Never the less, I will definitly be replaying this game, just like I rewatch Toy Story and the Iron Giant.","February 7","true","15.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

So let's go and try to do it.\n\nThe game starts off great - you got 2 pretty different characters in rather different settings going on about their rather unusual daily lives. The world is bizzare, characters are colorful and voice acting is great, music score while nothing spectacular does compliment the tone of adventure very well, so it really drags you in for the first 1 or 2 hours. At that stage puzzles are almost trivial and you spend more time listening to dialog and exploring the world, rather than getting frustrated filling out charts and solving equasions, it feels like you playing a lighthearted interactive movie more than playing a game.\n\nAfter about 4 or so hours in, with a bit of twist at the end, 1st act of the game ends and unfortunately what follows it up is one big mess. Act 2 is pretty much a dissapointment in a variety of ways - you meet next to none new characters, 95% of the locations you will visit are rehashes of the old ones, the plot unravels itself but leaves holes and doesn't really give a satisfying ending to the story. One important thing to notice about second act is the difficulty of puzzles - it racks up in a big way, so much, you would be excused to think devs have tried making second act feel longer by making you spend majority of the time scratching your head. Main strengths of the game so far: characters, dialog, bizzare setting, fade out at this stage in favour of trying to figure out what's the trick behind another wiring puzzle. It really kills the mood of the whole story and leaves a sour taste in a mouth.\n\nAt the end I feel troubled recommending this game, for even though I still managed to squeeze some fun out of it, I also didn't have to spend any money, which made me far less judgmental. Since it doesn't really doesn't have interesting satisfying puzzles, or at least a decent enough ending to the story, I urge you to purchase this product at your own discretion, for it can really get your hopes up only to crash them down and leave you feeling dissapointed.","July 24, 2015","false","13.5"," 21 of 38 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","21","38","0","2"

Well, actually, story with puzzles.  I liked that most puzzles were not too difficult, but enough to make it fun. (Remember the wiring!  That will make sense the first time you play and realize you paid no attention.)\n\nThe story was deeper than I thought it would be and, happily, longer than I thought it would be.  Don't let the unusual art work deter you.  It is more sophisticated than it seems from the previews.  It fits well with the story and I enjoyed this.\n\nAs for playability, I've played through once so this is from a one-time play-through perspective.  Let me put it this way, if you enjoy reading a story, setting it aside for awhile and then reading it again, you could replay and enjoy it. If, however, you are a person who reads a book once and never reads it again, you may not enjoy playing it again.  But I bet you enjoy playing it at least once.\n\nThough the story seems to be set, the fact that you are allowed to solve the problems in your own time, and some interaction is done differently, I think you could play it more than once.\n\nI definitely recommend it.","March 30","true","17.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Act II continues to use the same wonderful intuitive UI and fantastic art and music but the puzzles suddenly jump from a small part of the overall game to stupidily hard. As in - even if you have a walkthrough telling you exactly what you need to do it's still tricky to solve.

I have in fact played through the game once, and it took about 7 hours of actual playtime.\n\nPart 1 was a nostalgic, traditional (charming) point and click adventure. Part 2 is very much not.\n\nThe puzzles in part 1 were very much typical, nostalgic point-and-click adventure puzzles that could be solved by talking to everyone and clicking on everything. They were mostly logical, congruent with their setting, and solvable by understanding how the locale in which they are found works. The puzzles in part 2 are "puzzle game" puzzles for the sake of puzzles (does puzzle look like a word anymore?), in the tradition of Myst or (a better example) Puzzle Agent 2. They are arbitrary, have little to do with their surroundings, and interchangeable.\n\nThe thing is - no one at Double Fine ever designed a "puzzle game" before and (consequently?) they are really really terrible at it. In (say) Puzzle Agent, you solve a puzzle by figuring it out logically (mathematically, whatever). In Broken Age act 2, you solve a puzzle by following instructions. The only difficulty you're facing is the fact that the instructions were written by a drooling ♥♥♥♥♥♥, and you have to write them out and puzzle the meaning from the gibbering.\n\n(Almost everything in act 2 is also recycled from act 1)\n\nI rather enjoyed the first act, though it was over in 2 hours or so (fairly complete exploration with no walkthrough). Act 2 had very little joy, and was mostly frustratingly obtuse. I would rnot recommend you purchase it. In fact, I really should have youtubed a playthrough of act 2 after completing act 1, even though I already had the game.","May 15, 2015","false","39.6"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

It was almost two years ago when Tim Schafer decided that he wanted to make another point-and-click adventure game, and he wanted the internet to fund it. Needless to say, it was a resounding success, and for a while all we wanted to talk about[thenexus.tv] was games on Kickstarter. The first half of Broken Age is out now, with the second half coming later this year.\n\nThe game is split into two different stories, with two different protagonists: Vella on the left, and Shay on the right. Once you choose one of them, you start their story, but you can switch between them at any time. I used this once when I got frustrated with a puzzle I was having trouble with.\n\nVella's story starts off in her village, which is made up entirely of bakers. Every generation they have the Maidens' Feast, where several young women are offered up to a big monster called Mog Chothra so it won't destroy the village. Needless to say, Vella is not thrilled about this and decides to fight back. Her adventure takes her to a couple of other villages, one that just had their Maidens' Feast, and another getting ready for its Maidens' Feast.\n\nShay on the other hand lives a pretty boring life: he's been living on a spaceship his whole life, and the simulation missions the ship throws at him have gotten pretty boring because they were designed for a toddler. Eventually he breaks out of this rut and discovers a whole new part of the ship that he has never seen before, and some real missions to embark on.\n\nVisually the game is gorgeous. Everything looks hand painted, and in typical point-and-click fashion the camera is usually fixed, at most moving left or right as you move around the environment. There were a few places where I thought the textures looked low-resolution, but honestly it wouldn't have made much of a difference because of the art style.\n\nMechanically it plays almost exactly like a point-and-click from the 90's. Or at least that's what I assume because I wasn't doing much video gaming in the 90's. All of the "puzzles" involved finding a specific item or combination of items to use in a particular way in a particular place to solve a problem. Most times it was pretty clear what needed to be done, and failing that just a little snooping around would uncover the solution. There was that one time though where the solution involved going back and forth through several areas to get different items, and I completely did not understand what I was supposed to do. Yeah, I looked up the solution to that one.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Broken Age is the voice cast. Having people like Elijah Wood, Jennifer Hale, and Jack Black in the same game is delightful to my nerd brain. And Wil Wheaton playing a hipster lumberjack hiding from the talking trees was the best moment of my week.\n\nIt took me just over four hours to complete Act 1, and they left us on quite the cliffhanger. It's definitely worth getting now, because Act 1 is a good length to finish in one or two sittings. This is one of the few games I have played that is appropriate for both adults and kids, so if you are a parent check it out. It's a little hard to name a good price because I have no idea how good Act 2 will be; if it keeps up the quality that Act 1 had, I would say that $20 is a good price.","February 18, 2014","true","13.6"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rattattack/recommended/232790/","Rattattack","Never Lucky","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Rattattack/","115 products in account","I can't recommend this game.\n\nAct 1 is short, fun, and whimsical. Its puzzles are easy, which allows you to explore the beautiful environments and meet all of the interesting characters without too many barriers in your way.\n\nAct 2, on the other hand, is just a frustrating mess. The entire act merely retreads the areas visted in Act 1, which removes the element of exploration that makes act 1 interesting. Worse yet, a lot of the puzzles are just ridiculous. Obvious solutions never work, and the actual solutions often make no sense in terms of why they would work or why the characters would try them. I've spent hours going through the levels clicking everything and trying to use my items on every object, and this is a common trend among players. For some puzzles, you have to go to the other character's perspective in order to find the solution, but the game never tells you when this is required, and it goes counter to everything you've done in act 1, so you might go through entire levels looking for answers that aren't there.\n\nAfter Double Fine spent over a year developing act 2, it's such a disappointment to see recycled environments and puzzles that are just badly designed and badly thought out. Perhaps those problems might be more forgivable if the quality of the story made up for it, but it doesn't. Despite the brilliant setup in act 1, neither of the two main characters undergo much if any character development in act 2. Instead, we're treated to a bad science fiction plot which tries to explain the superficial elements of the world, and yet still leaves many questions unanswered in the cliffhanger ending. The villains expose themselves as something out of a children's cartoon, and some of the dramatic reveals only make sense if you don't think too deeply about act 1.\n\nThis game is a huge disappointment to me, and thinking about it still leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. If you want to see the interesting environments and the story that could have been, watch act 1 on youtube. If you must, watch act 2 on youtube as well. The game itself is absolutely not worth playing.","May 7, 2015","false","12.2"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

I have been waiting forever for Act 2 of this game, and when it came I was disappointed beyond belief. This game was going so well, the storyline was perfect, there was good humor! Yet, when this final act of the game finally came out I wish it never did.\n\nStoryline:\nThe storyline in Act 1 was perfect. It had the perfect setting with the perfect amount of humor. Act 2 completely obliterates all of what you know and love of the original setting and storyline (and not in a good way). To add to this; humor is less present and even when it is it is poor. The characters in Act 2 are so disconnected it isn't funny. I began to ask myself "Why can't I meantion this to that person?" questions. There are so many things any logical person would tell another if they were in Shay's or Vella's position; but they aren't options. It feels like most of the dialog was thrown together without anying logical thinking in Act 2.\n\nPuzzles:\nAct 1 took me quite a while to finish but Act 2 took  forever . Act 2's puzzles are more of a chore than an enjoyment. I tried for  three hours  to finish Act 2 without cheating; but it was inevitable. I finally looked up a guide and had to use it basically the rest of the way. Even after I got past my struggle; the puzzles were still basically impossible. Act 1 required no transfer of knowledge between characters or to write anything down. I loved Act 1's puzzles because I didn't have to write anything down; I could actually figure out the puzzles without a paper in an enjoyable and slightly difficult way. Act 2 you suddenly need to write things down. Act 2 you also have to take your knowledge of one character's environment to anothers: this is horrible! While other games have done it, Act 1 did not. This should not have been just thrown in like that for Act 2.\n\nOverall:\nI have lost all love for this game as a whole. I can never give this game a positive vote with the way Act 2 has been made. I loved this game so much when it was just Act 1; when it had a storyline, when it had humor, when it had puzzles, when it  was  a game, but Act 2 has sent it into the ground and made the last six to seven hours of the game a chore.","May 7, 2015","false","11.8"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

There is no really difficult puzzles, no pixel scanning with the cursor and no revisiting areas and dialog trees over and over again, causing that all familiar frustration that comes with most point and click adventures. I know from being a backer and watching the documentary that Tim Schafer wanted to avoid this type of frustration and he certainly has achieved it. At the expense of more difficult puzzles? Yes. But that's not a bad thing. I kind of do wish they were just slightly harder, but truly I am not that bothered at all.\n\nInstead, this game is smooth and fun to "play". It's like walking into a piece of art, not only visually but the music and voice acting are also brillant. I have seen a couple of comments where people have mentioned the Spoon character, which is just awesome. He reminds me of "Talky the Toaster" from Red Dwarf.\n\nThe best bit about playing this game is that it takes you into another world from a collective (double fine) imagination, where you really want to see what happens next and how it all pans out. The story is really quite compelling. And just wow, that ending :)\n\nVella's side of the story is the most artistic and fun to play, but to get the best from it play Shay's side first right to the end. Although, you can of course switch between the girl/boy side at any point and continue from where you left off. Just don't complete Vella's side before Shay's. At least for me, I'm certainly glad I did it in this order.\n\nIt should take you around 4 hours to complete Act 1, not the two hours that many mention. I wonder if they have even played both sides yet? Or just followed the first guide that was released? At the very least they didn't take the time to explore the content and dialog. ALthough I did get stuck on the helmet puzzle for a bit (no spoilers!).\n\nTo all those wondering about the cost of this game (£17.09 with 10% off pre-purchase) all I can say is.. How much does it cost you for a ticket to go watch a movie nowadays? £8-10 for 1.5 hours of entertainment? If Act 2 is another 4 hours long, you do the math.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed it and couldn't put stop playing just for the story.\n\nCan't wait for Act 2!","January 15, 2014","true","4.7"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

The story does have me engaged, and I am very much looking forward to its continuation. Without spoiling the game, I'll say that I thought I had the game figured out, only to have my pre-conceptions blown apart by the end of act 1. If you enjoy the adventure games of old, and were more into them for the story than the puzzles, I can't recoommend this game highly enough.

If you are at all familiar with Telltale's adventure game work over the past few years- Tales from Monkey Island, The Walking Dead, The Wolf Among Us, the Sam&Max games... so you're buying not only the game, but an unknown number of future acts in addition. Judging by history, you will probably get your money's worth by buying in on this.\n\nAs for the game itself... initially I was expecting pretty much what I got; something silly, cute, and DEEPLY ♥♥♥♥ed up on a psychological level (as I fully expected and hoped for from something from the mind of Tim Schafer!). However... once I got to the end of the act and the plotlines were finally tied together, the "♥♥♥♥ed upped ness" reached a whole new wonderful level.\n\nIf you have enjoyed ANYTHING in Tim Schafer's stable of products...

The wiring puzzles are a pain in the proverbial (so much so I resorted to checking walkthroughs online) and the whole thing feels smashed together into a big pile of useless goo.\n\nI, like many others dropped $35 or more on this as a backer.

I miss games like DOTT, and this certainly doesn't compare with those high standards at all.\n\nA true shame, really.

You controll two main charactes with possibility to switch between them any time, sometimes it is even necessary to find out a solution to puzzle in other character's "world". Main charactes are Vella, young girl which escapes her fate of a sacrifice for giant monster and Shay, a growing-up boy trying to escape his over-caring space ship. Plot is really interesting and I was hooked to see how will the two story lines cross or join.\n\nAs for the puzzles, I have to say they are mostly fair. You are given an overall clear idea (or multiple goals) what has to be done and it is up to you to come up with the execution. Many people complain that some puzzles in Act II are unfair because you had to look for the answer with other character in his/hers world. I found it interesting and smart, requiring you to think outside of the box or pay attention to details.

The game is incredibly short and since this is supposed to be about half of the game, I am very worried for the total length of this game when it's complete. The puzzles are very simplistic and straight forward which means that the story, characters and enviroments is what has to be good to carry this game.\nAnd they are. The game oozes of atmosphere with great characters, great enviroments all realised with a beautiful artstyle. The story is also good so far but I can't put down a real opinion there as the game is not finished.\n\n[UPDATE: May 02 2015]\n\nThe second part is now out and I have to say that the game all in all, is a disappointment. The first thing that is important to mention is that there are very few new assets or anything new to experience in the second part. All characters and enviroments are reused although re arranged and modified a bit to be the setting of the new story and the story in it self is not very good. It doesn't make much sense and the end doesn't manage to satisfy in any way.\n\nThe length of the game, as I was afraid of the last time I reviewed the game, is indeed very short and is mostly hold up by some puzzles that will take a long time to figure out. This is because the difficulty spike in the second part is enormous. While the first part was way too easy, the second one can be frustratingly hard. All in all there is one word I would describe Broken Age with and that is disappointment.

It's complicated, okay!\n\nWell, it isn't that I can't recommend this game. I would, to certain kinds of people and I know for sure that they are out there, it's just that I wouldn't to the majority out there. But let's get into this because as I said: It's complicated...\n\nLet's talk about the mechanics first.\nIt's your standart Point'n'Click Adventure. Inventory system's a bit wonky but it does its job. Collect items, drag and drop, solve puzzles. That's about it.\nThe only new and interesting thing - and the one that drew me to it in the first place - is that you switch between the two main protagonists and experience the world from their points of view. They didn't really do anything with it mechanic-wise until Part 2 though, so up until then it was only a gimmick really. But a nice one. I enjoyed switching between charakters every other puzzle and it helped to paint a better picture of the world and its story, in my opinion.\n\nOh, story. In theory I should love this game. For me narrative is more key to a great experience than mechanics (a blend between the two being the "perfect game") which is why I enjoy games that do focus on it more than I do "skill-based" ones. Adventure games typically one of the genres that shine in that regard.\n\nAnd the story to Broken Age is interesting. Well, the ending of Part 1 that is and some of Part 2 up until its rather anticlimatic finish.\nAll in all it's a story of coming-of-age, paralells and juxtapositions between the protagonists drawn rather well. All characters are likeable, the voice work is well done, the humour keeps your attention but nothing really stands out much.\nLooking at the other arts as well, the designs are great and so is the music, the animation does its job and all in all they work together well.\n\nBut never before in my life have I found myself so physically tired while playing a game. Not frustrated, not bored, not overjoyed, not laughing - nothing. And that's a pitty because I like this game. It just does everything well but supposedly not well enough for me to really be enjoying it. And even when thinking back about the games I've played in my life this one will probably be forgotten somewhere down the line and to be honest, I'm kind of sad about it.\n\nWell, if you want to give it a try I can't NOT recommend it either. It's a bit pricey for the experience you get out of it, in my opinion, so if you ever catch it on sale and are curious about it, please, do help yourself. And I hope you'll be able to enjoy it more than I have.","December 12, 2015","false","13.4"," 13 of 23 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","13","23","0","0"

While indeed it is point-and click, it is by no means a throwback to those of yesteryear. The puzzles were beyond easy. I kept half expecting Dora the Explorer to pop up and ask me, " Do you see see the triangle?", with the preceding pause and eventual highlighting of the object. This was only enhanced by the art direction of the game. It is done very much in the style of Nick Jr. cartoons. But, I figured what the game was lacking in animation it would make up for in both storyline and mechanics. I was sadly disappointed. The storyline fit the art direction. Meaning, it would be entertaining for an audience of toddlers. And this same thread followed into the mechanics as well. Which Items could be interacted with were very obvious in the environment: oversized, brightly colored, etc, compared to the old LucasArts games that would take hours, days, or months to discover what needed to be done next to progress forward.\nTo sum things up, if you loved point-and-click titles, like The Secret of Monkey Island, THE DIG, and LOOM, you're better off replaying them. However, if you enjoyed those titles, and want a game for your toddler, than look no further.","February 1, 2014","false","6.0"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

I'm not sure what I was expecting going into Broken Age, I guess I assumed it would be better than it turned out to be. This is just not my sort of game I guess, I just didn't find it at all entertaining or compelling. The story is incredibly weak in my opinion, and I was under the impression that was supposed to be the strong point. The artwork is really nice... But that does not make up for the lack luster story and uninteresting plot. Apparently millions of dollars went into this, but I fail to see where it all went. There are better games in this genre, made for far less money. But considering kickstarter made the game profitable before it was even released I'm not really surprised. Broken Age is not a bad game, its just not at all what I would expect from a title with such a massive budget and exponential waves of hype. I'm just not satisfied with it. And I can only recommend it if it goes on sale, $5, $10 if your interested.

Both parts are too short, even though it's just the first half of the game. I finished it in 6 hours, and I'm sure you could do it in four.\n\nThe boy part is very babyish. The puzzles at the beginning are extremely simple, which is of course intended, but still I think it would bore even a child of 12. Even when the boy meets the wolf (which actually looks more like a fox), things stay rater simple. The graphics on the screen of the "rescue machine" are horrible, this whole rescue thing doesn't feel real, but is very abstract and silly.\n\nThe girl part is much better. I even actually like this part of the plot. There are some jokes (finally) and even some puzzles that aren't just trivial. (They aren't very hard either, but that's OK.) The part tastes a little too girlish for me, but that's just my opinion. I liked the two sentinels and the puking tree best.\n\nThe graphics are quite nicely painted in general. This is even the case in the boy part of the plot (apart from the rescue machine's screen). The problem with the scenery in that part is that everything looks so baby-like, I can't help disliking it. In the girl part, I especially like the slow animation of plants in some screens, or the birds in the sky at the beach. When there is a closeup, however, graphics become very blurry. Also, apart from some smoke and a laser ray, there's almost no special effects.\n\nI like the fact that the music was played by a real orchestra. Unfortunately, it doesn't make much difference, because the game lacks of a recognisable theme. There is no opening sequence, no central score, so the music stays just in the background. The thing with background music is that it tends to get on your nerves after some time. I would have liked it better if there was one score that appeared in cutscenes, while the rest of the game would stick to ambient sound effects.\n\nThe overall impression of the game is not very good. It's too short, babyish, girlish, unchallenging, uninspiring. I'm not sure if I am going to be willing to invest six more hours playing the second part when it's out.","February 5, 2014","false","6.3"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","15","27","0","0"

Unfortunately, I cannot recommend it for the full retail price.  So why do I recommend this game, anyway?  Read on...\n\nFirst Impressions\nThe first thing you will notice are the well-scripted animations for each character.  The art style is quite appealing to the eyes, and fluidity between actions is definitely there.  The game is played by switching between the perspectives of a young man (Shay) and young girl (Vella); I started my playthrough as Vella and was instantly sold on the story.\n\nGame Structure\nThe game is split into two acts, and for me the first act was more story-driven, while the second act was very puzzle-driven.  As I mentioned, the story is pretty good and I always wanted to uncover more, but the climax and ending fell short of my expectations.  The second issue I have with the game are the puzzles, which I will explain in more detail...\n\nThe Puzzles\nAh yes, the puzzles!  If you go and read discussions (SPOILERS IN THERE) you will find that many people are complaining that the puzzles for this game are way too hard to the point that they are "moon logic" puzzles.  I somewhat disagree.  During my first (and only) playthrough I found that the solutions to two particular puzzles were very farfetched and even said aloud to myself in both instances, "who would ever think to do that?".  Near the very end of the game is a third puzzle that is actually very complex and difficult to solve, but I ended up enjoying it since I had some pen and paper ready for notes.  This third puzzle alone easily took me about an hour to complete and is the puzzle that many people complain about.  In my opinion, some of the other puzzles were more confusing and tedious.  All-in-all, I liked the mix of puzzle difficulty and adventure, but I have to admit that I used a walkthrough on more than one occasion when I felt stuck (which is hard to do if you don't want to spoil the rest of the game).  So, if you are not super casual and have the patience to spend an hour or more on a single problem, then you will most likely enjoy this game.\n\nRecommendation\nNow for the reason I cannot recommend it for the full retail price of $25: a very bad ending.  Everything up to the very end of the game answered enough questions to keep me thoroughly entertained.  However, once you complete the game you are left with a series of images on the credits screen that fill in the final bits of the story.  It helps explain what people ended up doing once the story has concluded, but it fails to answer many questions about the final scene of the game.  I had so many questions about the origins of Mog Chothra, the Plague Dam, Sugar Bunting's past (as Steel Bunting), and why the Volta's and Alex had to be tricked.  Also, the concluding scene never explains how the attack is abruptly stopped, why the whole operation had to play out for "as long as anyone remembers", and what happened to Vella's grandmother or why she was in Sugar Bunting.\n\nMy Final Judgement\nIf you can buy this game on sale then it is probably worth it, even if the ending is not that great.  The game had enough charm and other positive qualities for me to recommend it, but I would not have bought it if I had to pay $25.\n\n/Review","November 29, 2015","true","15.0"," 16 of 29 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","16","29","0","0"

I kept waiting for the tutorial to be over... but it never got any harder... there was nothing that took me more than 5 min to figure out and 90% of the game I did without even having to think out the puzzle since it was so obvious...\nThe game IS beautiful and the story IS interesting but it’s so short it had me reading the Steam return policy to see if there was a time limit in which I could return the game because it was over that quick...\nSteam shows I have 3 hours in the game total and about an hour of that was the game on pause to make dinner... I see NOTHING about this game that says 3 MILLION dollars was put into it... I am very disappointed and feel ripped off. Maybe if the game was finished or maybe if it didn't COST $25 dollars? This is a $9.99 game at best... I mean you get 2 to 3 hours TOPS with BOTH story modes and there wasn't much else for side quest or exploration... such a letdown.

I knew I should have just watched a let’s play instead of buying it but with all the RAVE reviews I thought "how could I possibly go wrong?" Well it did...\n\nTo sum it up this "game" is WAY TOO SHORT & WAY TOO EASY to be a $25 dollar game... and it has almost ZERO replayability... I still to this day break out Monkey Island and give it a run though on my tablet every now and then... I just don't see it with this game... unless they wow me with chapter two...

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordWeh/recommended/232790/","LordWeh","Lord Weh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LordWeh/","344 products in account","You've likely already heard a lot about Broken Age as it's been covered in a lot of media... Long story short, it's the adventure game that was publicly funded using Kickstarter, the man behind it is Tim Schaefer (of Full Throttle / Grim Fandango / Psychonauts fame), and was touted to be a revival of the adventure game genre.\n\nWhether they've succeeded seems to be open to personal opinion, with the majority that don't agree disliking either the art style (which you can see in the trailer and screenshots, and I think is gorgeous), or that the puzzles are too easy. I'll come back to that point in a moment.\n\nThe game itself is charming and always interesting. There are two protagonists, you pick one at the start and begin to play through their story. They are in completely different worlds (one science fiction, the other fantasy), and you can swap between the worlds to experience the other's story at any time. This gives you the opportunity to take a break and return with fresh eyes, or just mix up the pacing. These two separate story-threads do start to show hints of coming together towards the conclusion of the games first act (whilst act two will release later this year as a free update).\n\nOne thing the game doesn't have is particularly tricky puzzles. It is worth baring in mind that as only the first act of two so far, the second act has been promised to have more difficult puzzles when it launches. I don't think the puzzles are SO simple to be insulting, but you certainly won't be stuck on any puzzles for longer than a couple of minutes. Most solutions are readily apparant with a little thought, and there's usually enough clues through the environment or the character's comments that you soon realise what needs to be done.\n\nI fully recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good story. As an adventure puzzle game it's a little on the easy side, but the story-telling, dialogue and superb voice acting, setting and music all make for an interesting experience regardless. If the second act has harder / more complex puzzles that's a bonus, but I personally feel there's enough to enjoy here.\n\n(Full disclosure, I backed this game on Kickstarter for $30 / £19)","February 1, 2014","true","31.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I find it frustrating that there is going to be a second act without an determined release date. I feel It would be worth it if both were released at the same time. But until then I would say wait. I know that the second act is going to be free, but it still feels odd, its like buying a season pass for a game but not knowing what you are going to be getting out of it, or when.\n\nBut there, that was my complaint about price, not substance. This game is a real gem, everything is hand painted,  and the way the animations work with that make the game instantly nostalgic. Its like a living cartoon. I showed this game to my 1 1/2 year old niece and she was instantly entranced. So the art is captivating and impressive. The voice acting in this game is great, it is splattered with famous actors. Like another review stated saying that the spoon in this game has more personality than most other characters in other games. I feel a lot of the big charm that hits you at the first of the game wears off a little bit after the first few minutes. It's not that it goes away, but the game becomes less captivating as I went along. But this is a great game to mess around with. View it like a film and then you won't be dissapointed in the time that it takes to complete it. plus add in the second act of the game and that should add 2 or 3 hours to the 2 hours it takes to beat the first act.\n\nI do have to add that this game has complete support for tablets and that is really cool. I keep on trying to find games to play on my dell venue 8 pro, and this one works perfect. My only complaint about the interface is that I couldnt get the hint button to show up on my desktop, it would only show up on my tablet. So In a way this game is better played on a tablet.\n\nWell, basically I would say hold off on this game for now, its not worth the full price just yet, when the 2nd act comes I would say that it would be worth it. I just don't completly understand why the people making this game can get away with selling this game for 10 bucks on the ios store, but sell it for 25 on pc. Its the same game, litterally, there are no differences or cut backs between the versions, except possible the 8 bit mode, but I have not looked into that since I don't own an apple product. This game would be completly worth it for 10 bucks and feels more of an appropriate price. But again I am getting into the price to much. As a game alone this game is great fun, it has such attidute that is easy to get sucked into. The world they establish just feels so strange, and when I say that I mean any one playing can sense something is up. It keeps on teasing that not everything is not as it seems, but it really lets you figure that out instead of just giving it to you. Might sound weird but it was worth it for the minute that I got to jack blacks character in the game. This game will make you laugh, and at the same time squirm trying to figure what its about.","July 19, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The old Lucasarts games such as Monkey Island 1&2, Day Of The Tentacle and Grim Fandango are among my favourite games ever created and so I jumped at the chance to play a new adventure game from the same mind involved in those classics. I was not dissapointed. The writing takes on a different mood from his previous efforts in this genre and is less about side splitting humour and more about telling the story about the tragic lives of 2 seemingly unrelated teenagers with drastically different lives. That's not to say there are not funny moments, some of the humour is genuinly brilliant. The visual style is the thing that struck me most about this game though with it's amazing storybook visuals which look amazing when the characters are animated on screen.\nAt the time of this review only act 1 is available and comes in at around 4 hours long. I can already say my money was well spent and cannot wait for act 2.

I finished this today and here are some of my thoughts:\n\n- It looks gorgeous. I totally loved some of the hand painted sceneries. I can understand why it might not appeal to some people; however, if you don't like the style, that's no reason to qualify it as a "cheap looking flash game". Even if they have a childish vibe, the backgrounds and the characters are well polished. Moreover, I feel that they have a little more personality than the regular cartoonish or detailed fairytale-ish style of recent point&click adventures. But as I said, it's a matter of taste. Look at the screenshots and decide for yourself if it's your kind of game.\n\n- It is easier to play than most of the old school point&click adventures. If you're looking for pixel hunting, engineering puzzles and running around with 20 items in your inventory, this might not be your kind of game. I found it to my liking, since I'm not a fan of spending 2 hours on a puzzle or constant alt-tab-ing to check the walkthrough. They said the second part will feature harder puzzles, so you might want to wait for the reviews of the full game, if you're not sure it will be enough of a challenge for you.\n\n- The music and voice acting are great, and that means a lot. Most adventures released in the past few years have very bland, if not outrightly bad voice acting. Elijah Wood and Masasa Moyo did a great job voicing the main characters. I also enjoyed the performances of David Kaufman (as Marek) and Wil Wheaton (as the hipster lumberjack).\n\n- I didn't find it as funny as the old Lucas classics (Monkey Island, Day of the Tentacle), but it made me chuckle several times. It is definitely a charming game.\n\n- As I started to grow fond of the characters and feel warm and fuzzy inside, the first part was over. Yeah, I agree it's a little too short. Not 2.5-3 hours long, as some complained, more like 4 or so (it took me 5 hours to finish it). Still short. Ending the first part on a cliffhanger didn't help.\n\n\nSo, tl;dr:\n\nDON'T buy this game if:\n- You're not a fan of point&click adventures;\n- You don't like this particular hand drawn style of graphics;\n- You like your puzzles ruthless with a touch of illogical;\n- You hate playing games in a seasons/episodes format.","January 17, 2014","true","16.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Ok, this masterpiece came from the brilliant mind of Tim Schafer, the King of point-and-clicks, who hasn't made a point-and-click adventure game in over 16 years. But he still has it! Broken Age tells the story of two vastly different, yet eerily similar, young people, Vella and Shay. You can play whoevers story first and alternate between them, in case you are stuck on a puzzle, which I believe is a brilliant mechanic. The visual art style is absolutely gorgeous and the characters are well developed. The gameplay is, well, point-and-click and if you aren't a fan of this, the game won't change your opinion on it.

I've heard of complaints that the puzzles are too easy and I'd disagree, though unlike some games, if you use the spanner and then the bucket on an item to try to solve a puzzle, it will often give you a hint that you need to use the item on the bucket then spanner, rather than keeping you guessing at every possible combination for hours on end. I liked the riddle, mainly because I didn't have the item in question and only by working it out did I know where to go to solve it.\n\nPart 2: the problems definitely ramp up in difficulty and, though I liked the challenge, I have a beef with some aspects of this. MINOR SPOILER AHEAD Several problems rely on using information one of the characters you control discovers with the other, but, in some cases, there's no way the information could be passed on. Sort of like a game in which a person in England in the 1870s discovers a diary entry which gives the combination to a safe which is then used by a character you control in the revolutionary America. No internal logic to justify the transfer of information. They might at least have hinted at some sort of telepathic link between the two or something but if they do, I missed it... This irks me. Possibly unnecesssarily, and the rest of the game is great, it's just that this makes me go Hmmmm.

I want to scream and yell and claim it is a terrible experience, but I don't overtly hate the game. I had a partial bit of responsibility for bringing it to life (funding it way back when on Kickstater). As much as I want to say that I helped make this, I'm mostly ashamed that I got sucked into the marketing that Double Fine did.\n\nWhen Tim Schafer had claimed he was going to make an adventure game in the vein of his classic titles, I didn't quite expect him to literally do that. I figured we would have years of advancement in technology and storytelling play a bigger role with the finished product. I expected this new adventure title to do away with some of the more frustrating aspects of the genre's origins.\n\nInstead, Broken Age is a mess of a second half that fails to capitalize on the potential set forth in it's first act. The setup to this game is brilliant; two teenagers coming to terms with the way their lives are playing out. You have Shay, a boy who has only ever lived on a spaceship, breaking free and looking for adventure. You also have Vella, a young girl in a town that believes sacrificing "maidens" to some monster is the only way to protect their village. Vella is obviously a maiden and has to deal with the fact that she will die.\n\nThis plays a lot like most people's adolescent years; the game deals with how one can make their stake in the world. Instead of accepting that nothing will get better and the world is all gloom and doom, these characters venture beyond their comfort zones and explore the world outside.\n\nThe puzzles may not have been the most mind-bending things around, but that was excusable for the beginning of a game. You never want to throw the hardest thing at a player right off the bat; using a gradual curve to teach the player how the game works and makes their mind adapt to your particular puzzle schemes is a great way to ensure the gamer is left satisfied.\n\nInstead, Act 2 brings about some creatively bankrupt scenarios. The game essentially goes on auto-pilot and solutions take no longer than 5 minutes to pop in your mind. Maybe this has more to do with me being a veteran of the genre, but Broken Age does away with a lot of needless items that used to plague the inventory of it's predecessors.\n\nIn doing that, though, the game's puzzles focus purely on logic. With logic at your side, you simply need to look at the problem, check your limited supply and have at it. Eventually you get to the solution and your brain doesn't feel any smarter. At worse, you feel cheated out of a quality experience.\n\nThis also happens to the story. Each character, before some insanely convoluted twist, felt like a person with no understanding of their situation. They knew they wanted change, but they weren't sure from what. Come Act 2, we're now supposed to accept that these characters know each other and have some emotional tie (thankfully not romantic).\n\nCouple that with some other revelations about Shay's life and you're left with a portrait of a boy who looks selfish. That feeling of complacency he wanted to break from feels more like it was self-imposed instead of happening out of bad luck. Vella's family also deals exceptionally well with the knowledge of their old tradition being a farse.\n\nThe final puzzles of the game are also some of the worst I've ever had to play. You better like wiring robots and depending on omnipresent knowledge to get through; Broken Age features that in spades. Just quite how Shay should know a pattern that Vella is only able to see is beyond me.\n\nI get that the idea was to have players make the characters interact with each other in an asymmetrical fashion, but the execution feels haphazard. A better approach would be if Vella touched something on the ship and then Shay's world changed a bit. Other games have done this and it works great in making the player feel like their actions matter.\n\nFor that matter, why do we only get a few limited areas? Vella goes through the area Shay explored in Act 1 and vice versa. I know this is supposed to make players get acquainted with their environment, but it feels exceptionally cheap. It harkens back to the classic days of adventure gaming where memory was limited and hardware limitations needed to be worked around.\n\nI can only think of Monkey Island and how that game had 4 Acts that all took place in wholly unique environments. The sequels managed to make their worlds bigger, too. Broken Age just feels like developers starting off with ambition and rushing to make their promises half-true.\n\nWhy not bring up the the voice acting? While the cast is assembled of some great actors and their performance in the first act is quite good, the revelations we get in Act 2 should elicit more of an emotional response. Instead, basically everyone reads their lines in a deadpan manner. I think I'd be screaming bloody murder if I got locked in a ship I previously thought was a monster.\n\nYou can tell most of the budget was spent on the visual style, because the graphics are beautiful. Everything animates smoothly and transitions feel natural. I'm a bit torn on the slow camera, but it does give you a great look into the detail of each scene. It's like looking at a living water color book; it's whimsical and jovial.\n\nBut for as much charm the visuals have, the rest of the game just cannot hold up. I may be taking this especially hard as I had wanted this game for nearly 3 years, but I just get the feeling that Tim Schafer and Double Fine got in way over their heads. Their initial budget was a mere $400k dollars. For them to gross around $3 million before the game even came out is obscene.\n\nThen again, I guess we gamers are partially to blame for the lack of quality. We all funded this with nostalgia on our brains. We loved Schafer's previous work and just wanted him to return to a genre he had long left behind. Broken Age doesn't make me believe that adventure games are dead, just that Tim Schafer should probably turn his prospects on to something else.\n\nWe can never get back the past; this is a harsh truth we all learn in life. Broken Age could have been about just that. The premise starts off with a similar idea and then abandons it for familiar territory. If only Double Fine had listened to their own preaching and learned to grow over the course of this games development.\n\n5/10","May 2, 2015","false","10.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

An pair of two intriguing stories running parallel to each other suddenly shift into a single story that loses all intrigue by the end of it. The plot, which seems to have so much potential at the start, becomes so incredibly uninteresting by the end that I only felt obliged to finish the game because I'd spent money on it.\n\nThe main characters are bland, unintelligent, and seem to have very little interest in anything happening around them, even when possibly faced with their own demise. The settings, while interesting, are small and will only hold your interest long enough for you to realize how little world-building Double Fine has done with the world they created, and will leave you wishing they put some actual effort into them. And the gameplay: It's a point and click adventure game, so what little gameplay it has can only be based on the puzzles. Almost all of them are too easy, being tasks that a 5-year-old could figure out, or they're so obscure that you'll either need a walkthrough or a bottem-less well of patience as you click on every interactable thing in the game in every possible order, searching in vain for the thread of logic the developers were operating on.\n\nTo top it all off, the game ends with our two protagonists finally meeting after an entire game being seperated. What happens then? Nothing. They see each other, say nothing to each other, and the credits roll. No real resolution is reached either, as the antagonists (who were introduced very late on, I might add) were neither truly defeated, nor were they even properly explained beyond some very forced exposition.\n\nDo yourself a favor, do NOT buy Broken Age. Save your money, spend it on a better game like Psychonauts. That way you can see that Tim Schafer actually had some talent at one point in time before it suddenly faded and he started putting out garbage like this.\n\n(PS: The only saving grace this game has a a few key side characters, the majority of which are SILVERWARE.

Act 2, on the other hand, tries its best to answer the players' speculations (or guesses about the lore of the game) from Act 1 but only to end up with more head scratching and confusion that makes you want to say "How does this makes sense?" or just "What?". I'm not going to spoil the ending but the second half's story just feels like it's just wasting your time but the game is obligated to finish the writing.\n\nGameplay: In Act 1, most of the time, it was a breeze to solve through the puzzles. In Act 2, on the other hand, Double Fine did take the feedback of past players (who played act 1) for more difficult puzzles and made it happen, which I ended up pulling out a guide frequently because I encountered some puzzles that required you to just WAIT and one that you have to fix something with broken wires eats up an hour of the game because there's not much explanation on how this puzzle works which leaves me much frustration for every time the proposed solution doesn't work. I will never understand why hard puzzles complement well with a great story (not this game at least).\n\nArt: The only good aspect of this game, I praised the art design because it's like an interactive children's storybook adventure and now I won't be able to play this game again with my little brothers and sisters due to how the second act ruined the overall story of the game.\n\nOverall: I gave this game a 5/10, I was going to give a 6/10 for its art and some humor but I couldn't, because this is the first video game from kickstarter that achieved publisher-like funding that everyone hoped for AAA quality, and now, here we are, getting a game that ended up mediocre.\n\nSadly I love playing Psychonauts, and I'm even more sad to say that I'm disappointed in Tim Schafer not able to deliver the game's promise. No matters what others say about cutting him some slack or that we're all too hard on him and his company, this game was funded "$3.3. million + requested additional funding", there's no excuses for delivering a mediocre game.\n\nAgain, I can't recommend this point-n-click adventure game.

At the time I enjoyed the part of the story that I was shown, the writing, art and setting are all wonderful. However, I found it to be short, straightforward and all of the puzzles were overly simplistic.\n\nRecently the second half of the game was released and the game had it's official release as a complete product. I played through the whole thing again and found that the first half of the game works so much better when seen as part of the whole rather than as a separate episode. All the puzzles from the first half of the game are the building blocks for puzzles later in the game and they gradually increase in complexity. The storyline as well really builds on everything from the first half in the second half and the whole thing comes together in a very worthwhile and impressive package.\n\nBecause of that, this game should never have been split into two parts. I understand that Double Fine did this so that they could create a larger game overall and generate funding, but at the same time, the experience of playing it as two separate acts took away from the overall experience for me.\n\nThat said I do highly recommend this game now that it is available as a complete product. Be warned the puzzles are very easy and overly simplistic in the beginning of the game, and the whole thing can likely be completed in 8 hours or less unless you run into any major snags. All the puzzles had fairly easy to understand solutions with only 2 or 3 instances where I really felt that the solution was too obtuse. In addition there was only one time that I had to look up the solution online (SPOILER the part where Shay has to simply let the snake attempt to strangle him until it falls off, how was I supposed to know I just had to stand there the whole time? SPOILER) and there was one instance where the solution is only shown by switching between the two characters which I found annoying.\n\nI recommend this for fans of adventure games, and also those who can just appreciate the writing and art style that Double Fine brings to the table. If you don't like adventure games you might still find this accessible due to the simplicity of the puzzles and the engaging story. Otherwise, stay away.","May 31, 2015","true","16.5"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

In the second act some of the puzzles were of the try-and-experiment sort that was fun to solve, but most of them were rather obscure with rather hilarious solutions, similar to Monkey Island. I really liked the part where I got stuck on a puzzle for a while and the main character started drawing up a table as a hint.\n\nThe story wasn't in-depth or thought provoking, and in fact had some plot holes, or twists that were quickly brushed aside. The big bad felt rather signle dimensional, and you couldn't even visit the big-bad-evil's lair, only watch cutscenes from it, making chunks of the game feel like a missed opportunity. Some of the object interactions were pretty verbose but that's more of a relic from old-school games. Now, that said, the writing was filled with junevile fun with heaps of jokes that didn't feel particularly wooden. Voice acting was phonomenal too.\n\nThe visuals were pretty and hadn't noticed/encountered any graphical glitches since the second act update. Animations ran slick as butter and had graphics had a well drawn painterly style. Music was subtle and well made, which helped set the tone of the scenes and set up an enjoyable environment but were hardly memorable.\n\nSo, now, you're wondering why despite the critisms I'm giving it a positive review? That's because I went into the game expecting a light-hearted and cheerful game, and got what I wanted. To me the great bits of the game outweighed the bad bits.\n\nIs it perfect? No. Is it good. Yes.\n\nThere aren't many games like this and the only one I can think of is the Deponia series, but that game relies on being mean and offensive all the time, which just leaves a bad taste the further you go. Broken Age is *the* game you should pick up if you are looking for a light-hearted, point and click adventure game.","May 1, 2015","true","11.1"," 34 of 65 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","34","65","0","0"

The graphics and animation are damn pretty. Voice acting is good; particurlarly Elijah Wood as Shay. The story is slow at first but it gets better; it's no Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad though. Tim Schafer again writes some bomb-♥♥♥ dialogue; he's damn good at that (which reminds me that I should finish Psychonauts). Music wasn't anything special.\n\n$25 for the full release is a bit much. I feel that the value of the game is more like $15, mainly due to how short it's going to be and how replayability won't be high. I kickstarted it with a $30 pledge, so I shouldn't be complaining about pricing. I should note that I am satisfied with my pledge and don't feel bad about backing this project.\n\nI don't have much experience with point and click adventure games but the puzzles are not that difficult; I do realize that younger players might play this game too.\n\nOverall, it was a nice experience with beautiful artwork, sympathetic characters, and not-too-difficult puzzles; (MINOR SPOILER WARNING) and I totally called the ending of the first act.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ujuidarehcram/recommended/232790/","ujuidarehcram","UjuidarEhcram","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ujuidarehcram/","989 products in account","Broken Age is a point-and-click adventure game that is the result of Double Fine's massively popular, record-breaking Kickstarter campaign. You alternate between controlling Shay, who is overly coddled by his spaceship's computer, and Vella, who is just about the only person who takes issue with human sacrifice in her civilization, and figure out how to help them battle injustice in their own way.\n\nA lot of money went into this game, and it's easy to tell. The voice cast is star studded, with Elijah Wood doing an amazing job as Shay, and all-around great voice acting otherwise. The art has a beautiful, painted style. The orchestral music is definitely enjoyable.\n\nAs for the gameplay, well, it's a point-and-click adventure game. Some of the puzzles are tricky, but I never got completely stuck. The interface is pretty easy to use. All in all, it's a standard adventure game with modern design sensibilities.\n\nThe story is pretty interesting, and the game did a pretty good job of holding my interest. Act I is short, however, and at the moment, Act I is the whole game. It took me about five hours to beat. I really loved the humor, and Broken Age is full of it.\n\nOverall, I'd definitely recommend Broken Age to just about anyone, and I'm definitely glad I backed it.

The amount of detail that’s gone into that game is fantastic and I’d expect nothing less from that creative team. I hope a lot of people fall in love with adventure games because of this title, because it’s full of moments that I remember kind of delighting me as a kid with Monkey Island or Day of the Tentacle. Like, trying to combine two objects you don’t expect to do anything—but getting some kind of very specific dialogue for that action when it fails all the same.\n\nTry to combine fruit + ladder =\n\n"No, I don’t need a fruit-scented ladder right now."\n\nWhy on earth would they need to record that instead of just making an error sound! Because everything is fun in that game even when you’re getting things wrong. It really puts an emphasis back into EXPLORATION. Which was always the appeal of those games and really makes me feel like a kid again.\n\nBecause the emphasis isn’t on FINISHING the game or getting achievements or anything like that.

A great cast and imaginative art make this game worth playing.\n\nWhat you can't see from the trailer are the cons I've pointed out.\nAs others have pointed out, the second act of this game has a sharp difficulty spike. A good portion of my play through was simply being stuck in the second act, not actually playing the game. All in all, I had to look at hints 3 times to progress in the second act (not at all in the first). If you don't mind using a guide, this game will likely be great for you.

The lines by themselves were not the problem, but following one line of thought and then having to jarringly switch over to another to get a hint or key to a puzzle really bothered me.\n\nFor me, I liked the game, but I would have preferred to watch someone else play it (stitching together the dialogue best they could) or for this to be a short movie.","May 27","false","12.6"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/melbee42/recommended/232790/","melbee42","MelBee42","http://steamcommunity.com/id/melbee42/","417 products in account","Firstly, I didn't know anything about the kickstarter and surrounding controversy (until reading the reviews, after the fact) and I waited until Act 2 was available before buying and playing this game, as usually I like to keep playing these kinds of games until the end (I'm pretty impatient when it comes to finding out what happens next!). I thought it would make for a better gaming experience.\nSecondly, I am a huge fan of point and click games, having played dozens of them over the last twenty years or so. I'm usually pretty forgiving when it comes to dumb, illogical puzzles - it kind of comes with the territory with these sorts of games. I don't mind the occasional glance at a walkthrough to get me back on track.\nSo, now, the game. As many others have said, Act 1 was great. Although some the puzzles were really very simple, I didn't mind that, it meant the game had a good flow. The art style/look and feel of the game is great. You're introduced to some interesting characters and a lot of intriguing plot lines are started. You're compelled to keep playing, and that's always a sign of a great game.\nUnfortunately you then move into the second half of the game, and it was so bad that in several places I almost stopped playing (almost - I haven't abandoned a single point and click adventure yet...). Some of the puzzles were nothing short of absurd, and repetitive game-padding to boot. Unless you really enjoy pretend wiring robots. Strangely, that's not on my all time top ten list of fun stuff to do. Actually, it's not even in the top 1,000. Still, if you're getting really stuck and frustrated and want to progress, you can just consult a walkthrough, right? Wrong, because this game actively hates you so much it had randomised some of the solutions, so you either solve it yourself or you don't finish it. Why the game would want to stop you progressing when you're already at the brink of 'I give up' by removing a walkthrough option, I don't know. And whatever happened to games giving you gentle hints?\nAlmost as bad are the controls - sometimes for a puzzle you need to click and drag, sometimes you just click and click again, with seemingly no rhyme or reason behind the change, which adds to the frutstration for no reason at all. There's just no excuse for having inconsistent/clunky controls like this.\nDon't worry *too* much about the gameplay though, because the story is far worse. Did they stop writing this halfway through and chucked an intern at it to finish the rest? I'm only exaggerating a little when I say the 'pay off' in the second half equates to 'because reasons.' Most of the 'plot', such as it is, is relegated to a few lines of dialogue while you play as Vella, whilst Shay is busy on fetch quests for nearly the entire second act. Without wanting to give away any spoilers, don't expect this game to have an ending, because it doesn't. It just stops without any of the story telling 'this is what happened' finesse that viewers and players would generally expect. As an example, something major about a character is revealed towards the end and it passes by without comment from any of the other characters - at all. I prefer plumbers-rescuing-princesses type stories to this.\nThe other main issue with the second half is that there are no new areas. (A couple of new screens I think but nothing else, other than slightly altered versions of first-half environments) It's just the same places that you already explored in the first half of the game. That's it. Walking endlessly back and forth through the same scenes, because as I've mentioned, this game dislikes you and does not want to give you a quick-travel/map option. It wants to see you walk back through 10 screens again and again. Because reasons.\nI really didn't want to hate on this game as it started so well and it's the kind of game I love so much, but come on, Although the audio was great, it's not as critical as gameplay and story -please spend less money on Jack Black and Hobbits and orchestras, and more money and effort on writing and places to explore.\nBy the way, my playtime is so high because I fell asleep twice whilst playing this game (again, the second half of it). That should be indication enough of how good it is.\nIf you want a more modern point and click game, play the recent Sam and Max games, or Book of Unwritten Tales, or even some of Pendulo's stuff. Because this game is likely to disappoint you, even if you didn't back it on kickstarter/wait years for it to come out.","May 14, 2015","false","19.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

So, let's continue..\n\nThis game is pretty damn good. The first part is awesome, and the second part continues the goodness. But that's where my opinion differs from the most. The second part had better and more interesting puzzles, but the story isn't that surprising from there on.\n\nIf you love a good story, great puzzles - and I got through all of them without a walkthrough! That's pretty rare in the point-n-click genre! - that are very rich in design, yet very demanding, then this is a no-brainer. There's a couple of parts where you really need to stop for a moment and think what's happening, but other than that, it leaves a very rewarding feeling when you manage to understand the tricks there. Some point-n-clicks are pretty basic what comes to the puzzles, but this one has some very interesting designs there!\n\nAlso I am going  to repeat the most important part of the game: The story!\n\nOh my god.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kidnarz/recommended/232790/","kidnarz","Narz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kidnarz/","83 products in account","Let me start by stating this - I could recommend this game  only  when the second half is released or a big sale occurs. There are many reasons for this including playtime, replayability and puzzles, among others. I will be mentioning some scenes found in the game so if you haven't played it yet or don't like spoilers, skip to the conclusion at the bottom of this review.\n\nBroken Age has an interesting premise; enter the lives of two teenagers worlds apart as you point-and-click your way through amusing dialogue, varying puzzles and vibrant locations. I really enjoyed the colours and art scheme, as they fleshed out the characters and created a unique atmosphere for the player to explore in. Upon entering the game, you will have the choice to select which character you would like to start with first, Vella or Shay. Out of the two, I preferred Vella's story because the puzzles seemed more varied and she was the only person to have a boss battle in the end of the first act, leaving me slightly disappointed in Shay's tale. The characters feel different and made me laugh quite a bit, especially a certain tree.\n\nI feel that the main reason I prefer Vella is because the environments and characters in her story are more plentiful and vibrant than the secluded setting of Shay's. There was a lot of repetition in the levels aboard Shay's spacecraft. Sure, the repeated visits to his four missions had a certain charm to them, but the rescue mini-game felt repetitive and boring. One of his puzzles later on in the story requires the player to shrink their head to fit in a small helmet, but I only solved this by accident while trying to explore the spaceship. There was also a lot of backtracking involved, especially in Vella's plot, where I had to keep revisiting certain locations to retrieve items necessary for completing puzzles. I believe that DoubleFine not only needed to spend a bit more time increasing the difficulty of the puzzles (because some of them were too simple to solve) they also should have spent more time on Shay to balance out the two stories. Vella's is more unique and fun to experience because of the variety of characters, locations and overall aim of the plot. Would you rather slay a giant beast threatening towns with annihilation or avoid the AI aboard your ship?\n\nBroken Age is what I would call an 'interesting game'. Not in the sense of challenging to complete, but more so being really conflicted in my overall opinion after finishing the first act. The way the stories of the two protagonists play out makes it feel like two separate games, but not entirely in a good way. The focus on character development feels unbalanced, as well as the amount of content and a certain boss battle only Vella experiences. I expected a lot from Broken Age, but instead of a sense of satisfaction I feel like my cup is half-empty. Once the second act comes out (if it ever does) I will add more content to this review but until then I will say this - a half-empty cup is not worth $25 to me.","February 13, 2015","false","3.8"," 10 of 18 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","10","18","0","0"

It kept me interested enough to continue playing although I felt no drive to. The puzzles were a bit on the easy side, not really reminiscent on the nostalgic feel of point and click adventure games, which I assumed this, would be resembling.  The story kind of drags itself along at points which makes me wonder if there’s really any emotional investment involved in this game. The soundtrack is beautiful, the voice acting amazing, and the art style is fresh. The gameplay is lacking, and the storyline; I’m just not sure how I feel about it. I think charging $24.99 for part one is a bit stiff but I’m hoping that includes part two as well because for a few hours worth of gameplay I’m not satisfied.  Overall, this is one game I would wait for the second part to be released because it just feels odd without it. For what little gameplay that is currently available, I’d have trouble recommending getting it now and not just waiting. It just feels like this game has been shoved through a pipeline for the sake of creation. Worth a few hours of your time and a couple bucks.

When I bought this it was with the understanding that the second half would be out in a few months but it's been more than a damned year. I payed the sticker price for a full game and I got half a game.  I'm not holding my breath as to whether the second part really is ever coming out.\n\nMeanwhile Tim Schafer is laying off employees while throwing stupid expensive parties in San Francisco DJ'd by a guy who's now known to be a co-conspirator in a plot to rig an awards show. That is when Tim isn't taking a break to embaressing appearences in videos where he ♥♥♥♥♥ on his own community and calls us all mysogynists.\n\nIt's all just one giant ongoing fall from grace. Tim used to have something, he was an esteemed and respectable figure who made two of my favorite games of all times in Psychonauts and Brutal legend. Now he's just a sad has been who squeezes gullible crowdfunds and ♥♥♥♥s around. I hate to say EA was right but EA was right, he mismanages money and can't run a project. It's a shame because he is a talented artist, but I cannot overlook what a collossal shitheel he is or how badly he follows through on his commitments.\n\nPART 2 UPDATE:\nSo part 2 came out awhile ago and I finally bothered to complete the last chunk of it. In short part 2 is absolutely terrible, the entire story falls apart, all you do is retread the existing environments and I have no idea how Double Fine managed to spend about four million dollars and over a year of additional developement on this. Part 2 seems like nothing more than something put together out of obligation and little else, and it makes me strongly suspect they were just writing the entire thing as they went.\n\nBroken Age's story is a classic case of cool mystery leading to goofy revelations, if you've ever followed a show like Lost or Twin Peaks you'll probably know what I'm talking about. It contains several really obnoxious puzzles including one where the solution is to just stand around doing nothing and quite alot of tedious robot re-wiring.\n\nMeanwhile Schafer himself continued to be even more of a joke and a jackass than ever, and the way he runs his company I'll be very surprised if it's still in business in five years or doing anything more than churning out IOS shovelware at best. I certainly wont be buying anything else he makes and I'm damn glad I didn't give a cent to either of the kickstarters so at least my name isn't enshrined in the credits with all those other suckers.\n\nStay away, stay far far away.","December 23, 2014","false","13.5"," 77 of 150 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","77","150","0","0"

The graphical style alone has divided people but the rest of the game feels nothing like the old Lucas Arts adventures - the comedy is lacking, the puzzle quality is lacking, the colourful characters are lacking, the wacky art style is lacking ... it's just ... dull.

Not only is Broken Age proof that quality games are not made by a single "big" name but rather by talented teams, it's also proof that lots of funds can still leave you with only half a game with an indie feel and look that realistically barely even covers 10% of the amount they raised.\n\nBasically: big thumbs down.","December 19, 2014","false","0.7"," 78 of 152 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","78","152","3","2"

While charming in its own way, it is aimed, in my opinion, squarely at small children.\n-  Cause and effect are not strongly correlated in this game.  While whimsical and perhaps dreamlike, this makes gameplay feel rather unrewarding.\n- Storyline issues - one of the main characters has to fight for her life within the first few minutes of gameplay.  Unfortunately, this is not at all a stressful event because I 1) haven't been given enough time to really care about her, 2) no tension is built up b/c none of the other characters seems to be very concerned about her, and 3) during the actual fight scene, making a wrong choice has no negative outcome. I understand that as a point and click puzzle, you may need several tries to figure it out, and can understand why the developers made the choice to limit the negative consequences of missing the puzzle.  However, I would argue that a life or death situation requires negative consequences - otherwise, you are proving to the player that there is no real "problem" to be solved in the game - you have eliminated the biggest "problem" there can be.\n-  There is no finesse needed to interact with non player characters;I found myself simply clicking through the options as quickly as possible to get on with it already.  Several times I didn't even really pay close attention to the dialogue - but this largely did not affect my ability to complete the puzzles.\n- The puzzles, while at times cute / funny, were pretty inconsistent.   At times they were overly simple or simply bizarre / illogical, leading to a "click until you find it" strategy being a valid method of progressing through the game.\n\nAll in all, my critiques can be ignored if one looks at this game as aimed at children. If it is a children's game, all of these choices make sense - don't make the game too scary or too hard, put most of the emphasis on the whimsy and a positive message. So maybe I was just mislead by the reviews.\n\nPretty on the fence with this one; I really want to like it.  The storyline problems and lack of challenge ultimately led me to my thumbs down designation.

Act 1 was released on January 2014 and Act 2 just now (April 28, 2015), so as you can see it was a long wait for many people. I will rewrite this review as soon as I'll complete the second part of the game. :)\n\n----------\n\nBroken Age is a classical in nature point & click adventure game, that focuses mostly on the story, characters & dialogue. Puzzles themselves aren't challenging, although they are logical and support the narration nicely. Visuals are really charming - a distinct painted 2D art style. The setting (or settings, as there are two protagonists) is fresh and manages to grasp and keep the interest up.\n\nToo bad this is just Act 1, or in other words - it's half a game, and ends with a cliffhanger. Certain parts of the plot are explained by the end, but not nearly enough & the ending scene just made me want to immediately play Act 2, which is unfortunately unavailable at this point.\n\nThe game itself is quite short. It took me 4h 20min to beat it and I certainly didn't rush it. I visited every location, talked with everyone about everything and tried to interact with every object.\n\nEven though I would prefer to play both Acts at once & not wait indefinitely for 2nd half of the game, I'm still recommending this game :) It's charming, intriguing and enjoyable, provided one likes story focused adventures.","January 29, 2015","true","4.3"," 59 of 115 people (51%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","51","59","115","3","0"

I got bored with it rapidly. if your into games with a cute setting or like the ps1 games of old it may be worth a play. it isn't a full game.\nverra's story is better than shays.\n\nthe game is broken into acts and two seperate stories. shay, the guy in space follows a young adult who is being mothered on a ship. He is sick of going on pointless childish missions set up by the Ships Computer. One day he meets a stranger who convinces shay to break away from the norm and take on a mission on a galatic scale.\n\nshays story losses alot of potential because the of it's cheesy presentation. star system for example have names such as "prima doom" and "Smile Cluster". the warp drive is controlled by a tabestry creating robot. take note that the display of the ship is set up like a childs room for the sake of the story.\n\n\nVerra's story although apprearing to be aimed at a young audience feels less corny then shays. it is about a young woman who is put up as a human sacrafice. rather than seeing it as honor she decides to escape and fight the monster she is being presented too.\n\nthe story is light hearted but slightly darker than Shays.\n\nthe Gameplay in both stories is loaded with unintresting puzzles and repetative sequences. it gets old fast\n\nIf you find the ps1 games of old to be enjoyable then for $15 it's worth a play.\n\nkeep in mind the game is meant to be sold in acts so there is no current ending to the stories. neither come close to the edge of your seat that a tell tale point and click would provide.\n","December 23, 2014","false","1.2"," 24 of 46 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","24","46","0","0"

It had good puzzles, good intrigue- and a fine story (through Act 1). Then it's almost as if the writers went, "Oh... shoot- we actually should have done it like this. Let's try to slip this in and hope they don't notice." Act 2 is just a MASSIVE plot hole- literally seems like 2 different people were writing the story with the second left trying to connect the second to the first with a lot of saccharin overtones. In-game tries to explain this massive plot hole but it's like hearing a really unconvincing lie, but choosing to believe it because- "eh, I'll give the person the benefit of a doubt".\n\nOverall I'd recommend it, it was fun with a few challenging puzzles- you might get stuck in 2 places, (seems like a lot of people did) walkthroughs are helpful on that account. It's probably worth about $25 for ~40ish hours of playtime (you may go through it faster).

It features some of the most beautifully animated and visually unique graphics in adventure games I have seen to date. The puzzles are not particularly challenging, but creative enough to keep you entertained. This is particularly so for Act 1, and it's unfortunate that Act 2 fails to realize the game's full potential.\n\nThe game was released in two parts, sadly almost a year apart. Act 1 features one of the more creative stories in PC adventure games. It is full of surprises and intrigue as we do not quite know how our two playable protagonists' storylines relate to each other -- if at all! The similarities and differences between the protagonists, in their upbringing and relationships with those around them, told through parallel gameplay make the introductions to these characters all the more enjoyable. Act 1 plays like a game about adolesence, rebellion, empowerment and curiosity that ends with a great cliffhanger, making you yearning for more of this "something (thematically) different".\n\nNow, in the time that it took for Double Fine Productions to churn out Act 2, one would expect them to produce something worthy to follow the (doubly?) fine first chapter. Sadly, no. Unlike Act 1, Act 2 feels like an average classic adventure game, in which you solve a long series of isolated puzzles to achieve a single objective -- and you get to do it for two characters! This may be more acceptable if it weren't for us visiting the same locations and interacting with the same characters again. Plus, the protagonists do not seem to be at a disadvantage despite being in wholly unfamiliar settings relative to their prior experience. Such wasted opportunities for adding a new layer of challenge to the gameplay!\n\nAct 2 does bring a few new twists. While these twists are interesting, they fail to enlighten or completely surprise me. In fact, these twists confuse me more, making me ask questions that I surprisingly find the characters not asking throughout Act 2. If questions are asked, they are asked by the wrong protagonist, as if the protagonists share a psychic connection through the player. The inconsistency in characterization and storytelling perspective make the gaming experience slightly jarring.\n\nPerhaps Act 2 will be more enjoyable if 'Broken Age' were not released in two parts. If so, perhaps the wonder, magic and intrigue of Act 1 would have spilled over to the second act, and I would not have felt the "been-there-done-that" effect as greatly. (Hmm, maybe that's why Tim Schafer recommended replaying Act 1 before playing Act 2?) Despite my criticism of Act 2, 'Broken Age' as a whole is a good game. It is one of the better adventure games out there; it is easy to pick up and enjoy, and I recommend this feel-good game. As long as you keep your expectations in check, you are unlikely to be disappointed by it.","April 21, 2014","true","10.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I wouldn't necessarily classify it for children as some of the puzzles are challenging to solve, and there are some adult-themed jokes. However, there's not really any violence per se, nor profanity, etc.\n\nThe game play is pretty simple click and interacting. Some of the puzzles while if you put some thought into them , they are solvable, a minority of solutions I think would be difficult to come across if only by chance. The storyline itself is very unique, and I love how the two worlds of Vella and Shay come together in an unexpected way.\n\nFor the price it is actually very reasonable. I got about 10 hours of some very enjoyable time out of the game. I would say it might have some replay value but not much.

It introduces the characters and world with a beautiful, handdrawn, storybook-like aesthetic. It presents enough plot elements to keep you interested and intriged enough to see the Act to its conclusion. It explores themes centered around coming of age and rebellion as well as the potential dangers associated with each. A number of interesting characters are introduced and it evokes a sense of Schafer's classic titles.\n\nInsert a year and a bit of waiting. Now take everything established in the first game and swap the characters. Very few new locations (usually single, one-off rooms), only a few new characters and a number of awkward puzzles to lengthen playtime. Also, the story goes a bit off the rails.\n\nThe fundemental problem with Broken Age Act Two is that the more of its story it reveals, the more ridiculous it becomes. When you finally learn the antagonist's motivation for everything you realize it has almost nothing to do with the core themes presented in Act One. It's underwhelming in every regard.\n\nThis would all be forgivable if the gameplay was worthwhile. While some of the puzzles are clever and funny, others are an exercise in tedium. The worst part is that some puzzles play by their own rules. For example, I had an idea of how to complete the knot untying puzzle before I presented the necessary items to complete it. Because I remembered a previous knot and requested instructions to untie it after I had all the items, the solution was no longer valid. The correct order was to have all the items first then present them to the NPC then look at the knot then go back to the NPC...\n\n... then do this two more times (at least there was a fast travel)...\n\n... Why did it have to be three times?\n\nThen the wiring/rewiring and final puzzle was a royal pain in the ♥♥♥. If the order you had wasn't perfect for the final puzzle, you had to restart, rewire, reswitch, and reposition yourself until you got it right. If you made a single mistake you had to start from the very beginning.\n\nIt also brings into question how two characters in seperate areas are able to reference things from the other's perspective. You could argue that Shay remembered the wiring pattern from looking at his mom's photograph, but how could he possibly know the wiring pattern for the bot that Vella fixed?\n\nYes, "video game logic". I know.\n\nAll-in-all I have mixed feelings about this game. As a complete package I would recommend a buy to Point-And-Click adventure fans but only when it goes on sale. As for the general consumer: avoid. If you want a better example of Schafer's work, play Monkey Island 1, 2, and 3, Full Throttle, Psychonauts or Grim Fandango. Despite its pretty design, Broken Age is hardly worth your money or time.","June 11, 2015","false","9.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The puzzles start out whimsical and somewhat charming, eventually becoming frustrating and downright asinine.  The gameplay relies heavily on backtracking, trial and error, and obtuse "logic".  You will be forced to run circuits throughout the same 6-8 scenes over and over and over again, deseperately seeking to stumble upon some absurd situation, or item-combining nightmare, for which no precendent was set.  This leaves you swinging blindly most of the time, just trying to trigger the next element to some puzzle that really has nothing to do with anything.\n\nImagine, as a child, it is your birthday, and your parents throw a wonderful party; it's nicely decorated, and your friends show up in elaborate costumes; the presentation of it all is amazing.  It is not announced, but now it's time for party games; it's time to break the pinata!  ...because... well, you know you have to break a pinata.  ...but, you don't know where it is.  So you run back and forth across the various sections of the yard, and all throughout the house, looking for any sign of the pinata.  The clues to its whereabouts also probably involve calling random strangers in the phonebook until you discover someone who is also having their own birthday party.  You should probably get them find and take apart an old VCR though (hint: they don't own one; nobody does anymore), because ...WELL, JUST DO IT.  Then, with the VCR in pieces, which you know has something to do with the solution to something somewhere, it still doesn't make any sense.  Instead, you wander and cry for an hour before you finally stumble upon where the pinata is hidden.  Except, you have no implement to destroy the pinata, and are not tall enough to reach it. Then you realize that trading your aunt some string for a piece of gum, which you then place in the path of the Roomba that is vacuuming the house, will cause it to make a loud whining sound that causes someone outside at the party to trip and fall into the pinata, breaking it apart.  Except there are no treats inside, only tears -- tears of the fallen gods, who died out long ago after playing this game.\n\nThere is some genuinely funny humor in places, but it is peppered in among cliches, and contrived circumstances built seemingly to make a joke.  The dialog and voice acting is otherwise top-notich, though the quality of Act 2 overall, especially in cutscenes, did not feel well-honed, giving it a sense that the project was rushed.  There are some good ideas in places, such as with sharing puzzle solutions between protagonists, but they are executed in such a frustrating way that makes playing the game an exercise in patience and tolerance.\n\nPerhaps all of the shortcomings of the puzzles and backtracking could be overlooked if the payout of the story delivered something surprising or exciting, but it never does.  The only twist in the game comes early in Act 1, and the rest of the narrative just leans on absurd puzzle situations without actually delivering an interesting overall story.  For as odd, and deeply imaginative as the setting and situations are, the story falls flat and doesn't deliver any incentive to see it through.  There is just no payout, and that's what makes this the most disappointing.  If you must play this, do it with a walkthrough at the ready.","June 12, 2015","false","12.0"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The first act set up a really interesting story! And as much as I hate cliffhangers, I was totally on board for the second half of the game. Storywise, for me, it was like getting a wet dishrag for a christmas gift. The story goes completely tepid by the end, which is extra unfortunate because it made doing the ending puzzles that much more tedious. I can be totally into a tedious puzzle if I'm actually interested in the story outcome of the puzzle, but it really felt like a movie where all the actors stop acting and just start reading their lines from a prompter. By the end, I honestly didn't care what happened to any of the characters.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sheist/recommended/232790/","sheist","sHeist","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sheist/","159 products in account","Broken Age, when looked at as two seperate parts, starts out very promising and then starts to decline around the beginning of Act Two.\n\nAct One is short and sweet. It introduces the characters and world with a beautiful, handdrawn, storybook-like aesthetic. It presents enough plot elements to keep you interested and intriged enough to see the Act to its conclusion. It explores themes centered around coming of age and rebellion as well as the potential dangers associated with each. A number of interesting characters are introduced and it evokes a sense of Schafer's classic titles.\n\nInsert a year and a bit of waiting. Now take everything established in the first game and swap the characters. Very few new locations (usually single, one-off rooms), only a few new characters and a number of awkward puzzles to lengthen playtime. Also, the story goes a bit off the rails.\n\nThe fundemental problem with Broken Age Act Two is that the more of its story it reveals, the more ridiculous it becomes. When you finally learn the antagonist's motivation for everything you realize it has almost nothing to do with the core themes presented in Act One. It's underwhelming in every regard.\n\nThis would all be forgivable if the gameplay was worthwhile. While some of the puzzles are clever and funny, others are an exercise in tedium. The worst part is that some puzzles play by their own rules. For example, I had an idea of how to complete the knot untying puzzle before I presented the necessary items to complete it. Because I remembered a previous knot and requested instructions to untie it after I had all the items, the solution was no longer valid. The correct order was to have all the items first then present them to the NPC then look at the knot then go back to the NPC...\n\n... then do this two more times (at least there was a fast travel)...\n\n... Why did it have to be three times?\n\nThen the wiring/rewiring and final puzzle was a royal pain in the ♥♥♥. If the order you had wasn't perfect for the final puzzle, you had to restart, rewire, reswitch, and reposition yourself until you got it right. If you made a single mistake you had to start from the very beginning.\n\nIt also brings into question how two characters in seperate areas are able to reference things from the other's perspective. You could argue that Shay remembered the wiring pattern from looking at his mom's photograph, but how could he possibly know the wiring pattern for the bot that Vella fixed?\n\nYes, "video game logic". I know.\n\nAll-in-all I have mixed feelings about this game. As a complete package I would recommend a buy to Point-And-Click adventure fans but only when it goes on sale. As for the general consumer: avoid. If you want a better example of Schafer's work, play Monkey Island 1, 2, and 3, Full Throttle, Psychonauts or Grim Fandango. Despite its pretty design, Broken Age is hardly worth your money or time.","June 11, 2015","false","9.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Choosing different dialogue options won't throw you in a different direction like in some games, and for the most part you can figure out where you need to go and what you need to do next by exhausting every line of dialogue available to you. Before I bought the game, when I saw that there were different dialogue options available to the player, I wouldn't have thought that would be the case, but it didn't bother me, per se, and here's why.\n\nThe game is beautifully rendered and a joy to look at, it has an air of whimsy and a tongue in cheek flavor that I couldn't get over. There were some jokes that would go right over kids' heads, which is probably for the best, but which didn't fail to get a laugh out of me.  You know, those kind of jokes. I always count those as a plus.\n\nAlso, despite thinking a few times that I had the game pinned down, in other words thinking that I knew where it was going, I found with good humor that I was wrong. It managed to provide a twist that I didn't see coming, and for that I have to give it some more points.\n\nI finished the game in a few hours and I wish I had part 2 right now. I picked it up for 40 percent off (14.99) and I would say that it's worth more than that, counting the fact that there's more on the way and that I'm a sucker for a good story/twist.","May 1, 2014","true","12.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I don't plan to finish playing.\n\nI enjoyed the first part of this game. The art style was unique, the sountrack set the tone well and I thought the characters were mostly pretty interesting. I loved all the cameos, too. Jack Black, Pen Ward and Wil Wheaton are all in there and play appropriately funny roles. The puzzles weren't super difficult and relatively sparse, but I chose to reserve judgement until the second part came out. The story ended on a cliffhanger that made me pretty excited to find out what was going on. I was looking forward to part two.\n\nUpon starting part two, I'm instantly hit by the fact that they're done introducing interesting characters. I think so anyway. I got about halfway through part two, I think. The game continues and I'm not enjoying myself as much. It's like they told all the jokes in the first part and now they're trying to drag them out as long as the audience will listen. "Whatever", I thought, "I just want to finish the story!" Like a mantra, I chant this to myself every time some puzzle with an unintuitive solution comes up. There are a -lot- more this time around.\n\nI had to stop playing. Apparently they got the message that the puzzles were too easy because they managed to confuse the hell outta me. And then they do that thing that games do when you've messed up enough times that they begin to wonder whether or not you actually made it -through- second grade. They try to make it easier like "Hey, have you tried looking at all this stuff here? Cuz you know we put all this stuff here for you. No, not like that... Okay, well let me draw you a chart and put it up on the wall for you. That oughta help."\nThat's not an exaggeration. That happens.\n\nSo I'm not going to finish this game. It's frustrating and not as funny as part one. But the condescending attitude of a developer that feels the need to give unsolicited hints to someone struggling with a puzzle is too much for me. I'd rather stick with the trial-and-error that I was forced to do for nearly every other puzzle in part two.","May 2, 2015","false","11.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Many of the characters don't seem to have any purpose other than to be an artificial road block for puzzle business in the story line, and only a couple of characters I found to be memorable (often the characters that had the least screen time unfortunately).\n\nThe second half of the game also spends the most of its time recycling the same environments and characters for the sake of some pretty tiresome puzzles. The timing puzzles are particularly irritating and don't communicate well visually. I worked through most of the second act without needing any hints, but eventually I hit a point where I just wanted to be done with the game and so I read the solutions. No regrets there.\n\nI really like the art in the game, but I think a different, more traditional adventure game art style may have helped get the game done sooner, and I would have rather played a game with worse art, that felt more polished, with more environments, better developed characters and more refined puzzles, than this game, which feels like made a lot of compromises simple because it was so damn time consuming to paint and animate.\n\nFinally though, I have to say that I don't feel ripped off and I still hope Double Fine can come back from the damage that Kickstarter and Early Access have done to their reputation in the past year or so. The documentary is great (particularly the first 10 or so episodes before development started getting into trouble) and was worth the price of entry alone, and it's clear that the people at Double Fine care a lot about what they do, but this project had  some fundamental problems right out of the gates and the result is a game that I can't put up alongside classics like DOTT or Full Throttle.","May 23, 2015","false","25.6"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The puzzles suffer from what is commonly called "adventure game logic," meaning they were horribly designed, and the solutions only make sense to an insane person.\n\nYou will back-track a lot. Like, all the time. There are also only a handful of unique areas to the game, which makes the game feel repetitive. Additionally, there is no hint system to be found, so the game is best played in a relatively short time-frame.\n\nWhat I do like about the game is the humorous dialogues and the overall art style. The few unique environments present are colorful and vibrant, and the rough painted aesthetic is pleasing to me. Some of the dialogues are extremely repetitive, such as "I don't want to fork that" and other failed interaction lines, though on the whole I enjoyed a lot of the jokes.\n\nI am really close to recommending this game, because I did have fun and the game is very charming. However, I feel it is simply not worth the price it is being sold for currently.

Hell,I'd have been fine with just a glorified Flash game as far as visuals were concerned. And on that,BA delivers,unfortunately. It really does look like a glorified Flash game.\n\nWhat I was really looking forward to was the humor and a fun story. With games like Psychonauts and Brutal Legend under their belts,I expected fun dialogue and insightful commentary. What I got was a cold read through and a bland story that basically rips off Destroy All Humans.\n\nMet Shay and Vella. These 2 robots are the lead characters. Voiced by Elijah Woods and Masasa Moyo. You should probably know who Elijah is and what he can do,but as far as Moyo goes,she played Candy in Arkham Origins where she at least did a decent job of voice acting. Here,they're both so boring,so bland,so completely without any passion or character,it's mind numbingly insane. Even the great Jack Black,well known for not holding back in any of his performances and voiced Eddie Riggs in Brutal Legend,is just so dull. It's like they had the joy sucked out of them. These are not amatuers and there's really no excuse for turning in performances this soul crushingly bland.\n\nBeing saddled with these 2 lumps of blah would be bad enough,but the story is a forced march through cliches and twists so predictable they have no real turns at all. You'll pretty much guess the plot within seconds of the motivations of a character being questioned. And the whole thing could have been avoided had anyone in the cast shown an ounce of common sense. Not just the main characters,any one.\n\nThe jokes are so bad,so devoid of any real humor. I didn't even register them AS jokes half the time until a character laughed. The whole thing is just boring and dull and most of my time sitting there playing was wishing the whole thing was over with and that there'd be some kind of pay off.\n\nAnd at the end of it all,there isn't. The heroes are the heroes and the villians are the villains and at the end of it all,everyone is friends. Good god. Just "hey,all's forgiven even though you tried to kill us several times." And this ♥♥♥♥ was from the same people who gave us Psychonauts! And Brutal Legend! Games with fun stories and relatable characters and funny dialogue. I just don't even wanna think about what this means for Double Fine.\n\nI'm just done. ♥♥♥♥ Tim,♥♥♥♥ Double Fine,♥♥♥♥ this game.","April 30, 2015","false","16.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

And I had read that Tim Schaffer, lead designer, had said that people should replay Act 1 before playing Act 2 so that you don't forget all the callbacks.\n\nAnd I did.\n\nWhat a terrible waste of time.\n\nAct 2 throws away so many story elements that made Act 1 intriguing. And so making me play Act 1 *again* and then tossed aside a bunch of the story felt like a complete betrayal. And the sad thing is that Act 2 retroactively makes Act 1 feel much worse... because all of the intriguing setups have terrible payoffs and therefore make the setups no longer enjoyable in retrospect.\n\nAct 2 is like the Matrix sequels. Matrix 2 didn't seem that horrible until Matrix 3 came out. If Matrix 3 had been amazing, people would remember Matrix 2 somewhat fondly. But since Matrix 3 was terrible, people simply wish The Matrix had never got a sequel at all.\n\nI guess this is my roundabout way of saying that I wish Broken Age didn't get made and I hadn't wasted my time playing it.\n\nThis game is a big reason why I stopped using Kickstarter.

This feels like it should have been a movie and not a videogame. You are almost always locked into one path. It didn't feel like an adventure at all- there's no real danger. Also it's very short. I definitely can't reccommend it until Act 2 comes out.\n\n1) The game doesn't explain itself. Especially in the Vella story, I got through all the puzzles by clicking on things in my inventory randomly. Also, at one point in the Vella story you come to a puzzle that can only be solved by an object from much earlier in the game that, at the time, you didn't actually need to have. I ended up having to go all the way back for it. Then there's also the part with the snake that blocks the path. There's no way to get past the snake. It's basically an invisible wall. But I didn't realize this, so I spent a good amount of time trying to get past the snake because I thought that that was how I was meant to progress.\n\n2) Yes, I get that there will be a second part, but even with all the wandering pointlessly and clicking randomly that I did, I still beat the game (both storylines) in 5 hours. Again, half of that time was spent wandering around between the beach and the woods. I beat the game the same day that I bought it.\n\n3) Maybe this game isn't supposed to work this way, but there's no way to lose the game. When you finally confront Mog Chothra at the end of Vella's story, you can stand on the beach as long as you want, and even when Mog Chothra finally grabs you, you just dangle in front of its closed mouth for a minute until Vella frees herself automatically or you do something. There is absolutely no pressure on you to do anything. Take your time.","March 17, 2014","false","6.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

What happened between Act 1 and Act 2, Double Fine? I mean, aside from the year-long wait, of course.\n\nAct 2 was notably less enjoyable than Act 1. Where Act 1 felt whimsical, fresh, funny... Act 2 felt frustrating, obtuse, stale. Yes, sure, Act 1 had its fair share of problems. Shay's side in Act 1 was very monotonous, for example, but overall Act 1 was good. But Act 2 overall just... isn't. Act 2 introduces a lot more puzzles, except they're all extremely difficult and frustratingly obtuse. Some of the puzzles in Act 2 directly reference and are parallel to similar puzzles from Act 1. The only problem is, Act 2 launched OVER A YEAR LATER. By the time I played Act 2, I had forgotten everything I had done in Act 1, including prior puzzle knowledge.\n\nWithout getting into spoiler territory, the ending and lead up felt very lukewarm. The big reveal kind of fell flat, and it was mostly in the way it was presented. There wasn't really a sense of accomplishment. The story as a whole basically gets swept under the rug in Act 2, after all these plot developments and hooks in Act 1. All the questions are pretty much just handwaved away, leaving even more questions and a bunch of plot holes.\n\nSo... 3.3 million dollars and 3 years later for a 10 hour game, with a year in between the releases of Act 1 and 2... And it's honestly just not worth it. I actually feel bad not recommending this game, as I did enjoy it... mostly... But then I look at it as a whole and the disappointment sets in.\n\nGrab it on a sale, I guess. The writing is funny, the characters are great, the 2nd half of the game sucks and overall it's pretty meh. But you might get some enjoyment out of it anyway. I just wish Double Fine did better.\n\nReally, the big question is, where did the money go?","April 30, 2015","false","11.7"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","7","13","0","0"

They are filled with at least 10-12 hours *per chapter* and with more interesting and inventive puzzles and game mechanics. You know what else you get as opposed to this game?

If you've played any adventure games in the last 10 years or so, Broken Age wont surprise you in any way. What is available in Act 1 is very well produced, and there are more than a few interesting spots to explore, but overall the worlds feel rather empty. There aren't a lot of random things to click on that aren't a part of the story, which is one of my favorite parts of any adventure game. You can try to combine some of the items to humerous effect, but that's pretty much it. It's a very straightforward and linear experience, and characters vanish as soon as they are no longer useful. It feels rushed storywise, which is insanity considering how long it's been since we all put down money on the Kickstarter. Of course, a story's beginning without its end is almost useless, so I can't be too hard on it right now. In any case, it is worth a playthrough, but I'm not sure that $25 is the right price, even with another half of the game yet to be released.","January 19, 2014","true","5.9"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","1"

Plus it introduced a huge new plot point for no reason that tied up no loose ends and just made the whole thing confusing. It felt fake. It felt like a betrayal after how good part 1 was. The puzzles were increased in difficulty for no reason and they were mind-numbingly difficult. The solutions were usually ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It took 9 hours to finish this act (only 4 hours for act 1), with no breaks, and I was playing with a friend! In most cases I'd say my dislike of the ending or plot choices was my own opinion but Double Fine really dropped the ball on this second half.\n\nWould I recommend Act 1? Absolutely. It's still a fun and beautiful game, it's worth playing. I do not recommend Act 2 to anyone. Just stop after you finish the first part and let your imagination do the work for you, I promise it'll be a better ending then what Double Fine gave us.","October 6, 2015","true","13.2"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","13","25","0","0"

Good choice of character models and I enjoyed the warm color palets and brushy textures.\n+ Great voice acting. Some dialogues and stereotypes are really enjoyable. It made me giggle, occasionally.\n+ Huggable technology never gets old. Neither do cranky old trees or talking spoons.\n+- Some of the more technical puzzles can get a little bit repetitive or frustrating, but I liked figuring out the patterns quite a bit nevertheless. Hell, I worked myself through the Myst series, this was a less then a cakewalk in comparison.\n+- Story is fun and somewhat original (not going to spoil anything here), but not every element has gotten enough attention to be explained in a satisfying way. Could have done with a little more elaboration towards the end of the game.\n- The adventure puzzles are often too simple though. There’s always too little objects or set piece details to interact with or even just look and comment at to really get into that old school adventuring feel.\n- A wider variation of locations would have been welcome as well. I didn’t get the feeling I have seen enough of this world; I had been stuck in interiors for the most of the time instead, especially towards the end. While I very much enjoyed my time inside I was kinda hoping to see a bit more of the outside world nevertheless. Compare this game to Grim Fandango, Sam & Max Hit The Road or even Monkey Island 1 & 2 and you’ll know what I mean.\n\nIn conclusion: YES, this game was well worth the wait for me. I’m never in a rush to play a game with so many old games still unfinished, so I didn’t mind the delay all that much. I don’t regret backing it up and I would recommend it to any adventure game lover out there. If above points or the way this backer project has went down don’t bother you too much, buy it. And don’t forget to put a pen and paper on your desk while playing.","April 29, 2015","true","19.3"," 14 of 27 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","14","27","0","0"

It has humor, soul, depth, absolutely breath taking graphics and a story line that is as rewarding to follow through as any top selling novels out there! What sets this game apart from others, is not only the story line, the graphics, but its ability to skip from purely hilarious story telling to dark almost brutal and thought provoking moments. Act 1's story is purely amazing.\n\nIt's a duel story game where you can switch from playing as Vella, a young girl who refuses her fate as a sacrificial meal to a horrifying creature, or as Shay, a young, over sensitive and  somewhat lonely cosmonaut who may very well be the last human alive. The story line and script in general is jam packed with hilarious references and pure comedy gold that had me giggling all the way through...but there was more. What caught me off-guard with Broken Age was how deep the story would go into topics of loneliness, self-discovery and sacrifice too.\n\nFrom a game-play standpoint I loved the duel story-line modes because you could be playing as Vella and get stuck on a puzzle needing a little timeout, you could instantly jump into Shay's world and continue the other story line for a fresh perspective on the other puzzles later on.\n\nNo amount of words or compliments can actually describe how beautiful this game is, it's like your all time favorite comic book or coloring book come to life on the pages right before your eyes as the story is being told. The worlds are massive, creative, inspiring, and the experience of playing as either Vella or Shay is memorable to say the least.\n\nNow the much awaited review on Act2... let me start off by saying that the universe you find yourself hurled into in Act2 (which picks off right after the insane cliffhanger of Act1) is as beautiful and inspiring as Act1! Everything you loved graphically is right there, only it'll take you twice as long to get through it all than before, so more eye candy and heart warming moments to enjoy! New characters, crazy puzzles, and the most unexpected story line yet!\n\nThe main difference in Act2 is that, the universe is the same..I know, i said difference, that's because you expect to explore more beautiful worlds, only you sort of backtrack to all the places you've already been to as you meet new characters and the story yet again develops into this fantastic tale of inspiring goodness! While I would have loved for an opportunity to explore even more cities and places, I was more than happy with how things went because the characters kept me on my toes and interested the whole time!\n\nThe puzzles in Act 2 are at times super super super hard, and by super hard I mean Grrrrrr!!!!! hard!!!! Almost to the point of leaving me with a strange feeling that someone didn't think a particular puzzle through all the way, and some took far too long to complete, but overall I can't complain, the experience gained by solving them and playing Act 2, as well as all the fun I had, just made up for every moment of frustration!\n\nAct 2 wraps up the beautiful story and I can only say this was a gaming adventure I'll truly cherish! To all my friends and those reading this trying to make up their minds, trust me, this game is truly worth it if you're into this genre!\n\n\nIf you have any questions leave a comment or add me to chat I would be more than happy to help you further!","December 3, 2015","true","21.0"," 27 of 53 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","27","53","0","3"

One, is to see it as just the product it is upon final release. The other, is to see it as the experiment in Adventure gaming that it was. I'll be looking at it both of these ways, separately.\n\nAs a piece of gaming SoftwareBroken Age is low on bugs, fluid and fast. The art style is interesting, and the voice acting holds up well. While there are a few hiccups and inevitable bugs, Broken Age is a polished-feeling product in the end, that feels very solid.\n\nBeing an adventure game, one of the biggest parts of the title will be the story. The story is strong for the first half of the game, though through the second half it has issues maintaining tension once it resolves some of the lingering questions introduced in Act 1. For story reasons my recommended play order is Shay, Vella,  Vella, Shay, until you reach the finale.\n\nUnfortunately the problem with having a free switching mechanic when it comes to narrative is losing control of pacing. By letting the player choose to jump in an out at any time, you do let them escape a puzzle to rest for a bit when they are stuck, but you lose any semblance of control over story pacing for the majority of large arcs unless you design around it. This is particularly evident in Act 2, where depending on who you choose, something is immediately revealed, or held off as a surprise much later. In my opinion, the latter was much better executed.\n\nFinally, as a adventure game, the last part is the gameplay and puzzles. The game plays as a very simplified point and click adventure title. With no on-screen highlighting of items, selectable actions, and limited inventory, it is up to players to investigate and locate nearly every object they need. This is not Monkey Island, where two pages of items and 50 things to interact with could baffle you for a time. In this regard, it is fine, though finding a balance is difficult and quite often, solutions seem rather obvious because your inventory at the time is never larger than 5 items on average.\n\nThis is compounded by a few puzzles that felt padding. Some will require a piece of paper to take notes perhaps, or screenshots, but there are a few that simply require a few attempts before you will solve them, and being required to shuffle to the information and back to the problem, feels lengthy.\n\nConclusions?\n\nAs a product, I would give Broken Age a recommendation, with caveats. It's solid, it's pretty, and it's silly. But it's not going to make you feel terribly clever too often, and the story is good, but loses control of it's pacing. A worthwhile addition to the library, but not the crown gem of the genre.\n\nAs a project and experiment?Broken Age is a resounding success, period. Double Fine delivered on every promise of their Kickstarter campaign in spades, providing a game much larger and longer in scope than most could have hoped for, and with a very high production value. This was done using their own funds, and by giving up all their profits from Act 1. The engine and mechanics all work great, and the product fantastically proved that Adventure gaming is not dead at all. There is plenty of potential for other games like this to take off, and for Double Fine to be one of those making them.\n\nIf you feel their vision grew too big or the game tried for too much, that is your right. But the promise was only ever for a Tim Shafer Adventure Game and a documentary of how it was made, and backers received exactly that. Double Fine never went back and asked for more money. Instead of doing that when faced with the project failing, or proceeding, they used their own resources and IP to double down on the project to finish it, funneling company funds from all other sales into this.\n\nIn the end, it may make them some money over the long term, but until completion it was most certainly a labor of love.","April 29, 2015","true","13.5"," 33 of 65 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","33","65","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MakoSipper/recommended/232790/","MakoSipper","MakoSipper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MakoSipper/","3807 products in account","Act 2 is way better than Act 1\nFirst of all: don't watch a single episode of Double Fine Adventure! before playing this! I've read in the forums that I could watch up to episode 14 before playing Act 1, but I got some minor and medium spoilers.\n\nWell, Broken Age is a game designed by Tim Schafer, known for some adventure games like Day of the Tentacle, Full Throttle, and Grim Fandango. The game was funded on KickStarter with about $ 3.5 million when they had pledged only for $ 400k. The whole production process is involved in a lot of controversy, and I won't get into details here. The only important thing to point out is that Broken Age is divided in two Acts (the second Act also has a shorter "finale" which some people call Act 3), and that Act 1 was rushed out for financial reasons, and I think it affected its quality.\n\nAnyway, I'll list the most distinguised aspects of the game (good or bad) below:\n\n👍 The story is solid, well-woven and not something I'll forget anytime soon.\n👍 Different from a lot of games known for their awesome plot twists, Broken Age's plot isn't obvious. There were a lot of jaw-dropping moments for me, which are always nice.\n👍 I can see this game appealing to a very broad age range (despite what other people say). Of course, it won't reach all audiences, but it's not age-related, even though it's a "coming-of-age" story.\n👍 Most of the puzzles are really smart and just hard enough to give you that little frustration that makes puzzles interesting, but not too hard that makes you rage-quit (I beat the game without any help, btw). This applies especially to Act 2. You definitely get those eureka moments.\n👍 The level of the hints the game provides you is also spot on (again, mostly on Act 2).\n👍 Characters are interesing, fun to interact with and talk to, and have very distinguished personalities.\n👍 Voice-acting is really good, which brings even more life into the game.\n👍 There's a lot of extra additions to the game that really brings flavor into it. There are many things you can try out that will result in unique reactions, even if they don't help you advance in the game (a lot of them don't even provide hints). And that's a lot of work that really makes a considerable difference in your gameplay experience.\n👍 Graphics are stunningly beautiful--just take a look at the screenshots. Very good hand-drawn art.\n👍 BGM is also memorable. I even caught myself humming one or two songs when I wasn't playing the game.\n\n± While it's a good game, there's a lot of unexplored potential. I know you can only ask so much and that's not a bad thing per se, but it makes you wish you had more.\n± Playing with two different characters is a really nice aspect of the game. But I wish the game would explore that a bit more, making me go back and forth between stories more often (I beat Vella's Act 1 not switching even once to Shay). On Act 2, you'll need to switch between characters a few times, but they're still rare occasions.\n± I've played the whole game bug-free on my PC, but some people report a few bugs, especially in other platforms, so I thought it was worth mentioning it here.\n\n👎 A few of the puzzles were illogical (like the two characters sharing information via the player's mind -- in other words, for example, Vella learns something, you as the player learns that as well and have to use that information to help Shay, even though there's no way Shay could've known that), but those were excepetions to the rule.\n👎 Act 1 was way too easy. It was more like a story than an adventure game. More like a prelude, even. It made me question the quality of the game while I was going through it, but as soon as it ended, everything changed for me (for the better, of course).\n\n\nBasically, if you're an old-time adventure game fan, don't take critics on Act 2 too seriously. If you can handle some frustration of not immediately knowing the answer to a puzzle (and resist the temptation to look up the answer somewhere), then you'll enjoy this game, especially act 2.","December 6, 2015","true","19.9"," 37 of 73 people (51%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","51","37","73","0","1"

As I expected to happen, over the course of these 22 months my anticipation for this game steadily grew, ever so much more as its appetite was fed a diet of documentary episodes, game and art design updates, and an engaging dialogue with the reinventers of Adventure.  My fear was that this ravenous anticipation of mine would spawn an equally monstrous set of expectations that no game could hope to live up to; never have my tribulations been so firmly laid to rest.\n\nIrrespective of which story, Shay's or Vella's, you start out with, you are immediately drawn into a beatifully imagined and fantastical world filled with well developed characters following a meticulously laid out story.  I would often find myself having to briefly pause in my play of the game when the humor left me laughing too hard to continue for several moments.  The most enjoyable moment of the entire game was how the ending of the first Act caught me completely by surprise and desperate to continue.  This very satisfied backer's only real disappointment is the delay in continuing my exploration of the world and story.

Fascinating story, insane twists, some good humour, interesting puzzles, this is a great point-and-click game! I don't often go for point-and-click, I'm more of a survival horror or realistic FPS gamer, however I'm very glad that I bought this. The artwork, the soundtrack, the voice acting (I swear one of the characters sound like Jack Black!), and the world that is portrayed is very unique. I sadly only got 4 hours out of the playthrough (Yeah, Angry Joe wouldn't approve...), but it was 4 hours of quality.

I guess it all depends, if you like interesting characters, stories, worlds, twists, all in an artistic point-and-click game that will more than likely have some sequels, yet can overlook a somewhat lack of replayability and a less than 5 hour playthrough, then this is definitely for you.

This led to a lifelong enjoyment of Point-and-Click Adventure Games, including King's Quest, Full Throttle, Grim Fandango, Deponia, Whispered World, etc. This game piqued my interest early, and I was VERY happy to back the project.\n\nAs a Kickstarter backer, this game has met and exceeded my expectations. It's a well-developed throwback to the Adventure games of yesteryear and has a good amount of heart. The humor is on-target in almost all cases, and never groan-inducing. The animation is WONDERFUL, and the world is detailed and has a very Double Fine feel while still feeling fresh and new. There are a few spots where it feels as though the animation is not as fluid as others, but it doesn't interfere with the enjoyment.\n\nAs for the gameplay, the puzzles aren't terribly hard, and make a good amount of sense if you take a moment to think. This is the game's strongest ally; many adventure games rely on randomly assembling/using objects to progress the plot. This does an excellent job of helping you through puzzles through clever dialogue writing and timeliness. No more carrying around 10 useless items for the duration of the game HOPING that one will be useful.\n\nThis is easily one of my most favorite games of the year so far, and no Adventure fan's library will be complete without it.

It's the genre reimagined for these modern times. This means the UI is optimised for tablets. No menu's, only one interaction prompt and drag & drop inventory. The level of interactivity is very poor as well, only essential objects can be highlighted. All really unintuïtive, so it'll take some time getting used to.\nOnce and if you get over these modernisations the game will present itself as a charming adventure game. The artstyle is amazing, voice-acting superb and the music hits all the right notes.

You'll breeze through it, but at least that keeps the pacing going. It sets up part 2 to have some intruiging plot development and I'm excited to see where they take it.\nPick it up if you havn't yet, this is one adventure you don't want to miss out on.","January 25, 2014","true","11.5"," 16 of 32 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","16","32","0","0"

It's a point-and-click adventure, of course, but a very simple one; sometimes the only difficulty that arose was from temporarily looking over an item that needs to be used. I'm not sure if it's even possible to truly fail this game, to be honest. The game is short, simple enough if you pay attention, and doesn't particularly fall prey to the Sierra Logic issues that sometimes come with point-and-click games (Sierra games were infamous in particular for occasionally having puzzles with solutions that were so absurd, they didn't make sense). If you're looking for a complex puzzle game or something involving some combat, then you should look elsewhere.\n\nI recommend this game mostly on the merit of the story, music, and art style. If you've ever played Double Fine games before (Psychonauts comes to mind), then you'll have an idea of what sort of tone this game's story has. I enjoyed the characters and settings, short as everything was, and I'm glad I played it. I wish there had been more to do at least in some of the interactions, but considering this is part 1 of a 2-part game, I'm not going to hold it against the game.\n\nWhat this review basically comes down to is if you can like a game mostly for the story and style, then this may be good to look into. If you want a challenging sort of gameplay experience, though? It's probably not worth your time.","February 19, 2014","true","4.5"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","8","16","0","0"

The one thing that I expect from Tim Schafer is great characters and humor.  Small doses of the latter are still present, but the characters, I found I could care less about them.  Neither of the main characters has a standout personality.  The girl, Vella, is much better in this respect than the boy, and her section of the game is better too; but ultimately the game  never comes close to approaching the excellence of Full Throttle or Grim Fandango.\n\nThe puzzles stay away from the sometimes ridiculous leaps of logic of 90s adventure games - but almost too far.  The game is much too easy, with options being limited and solutions being almost insultingly obvious.  The game is about as close to "click button for more story" as an adventure game can get.  So the gameplay is certainly not it's own reward, which is ok in an adventure game because ultimately the point *is* the story, but in this case the narrative and characters aren't much of a reward either.\n\n---Part 2 review---\n\nWell, I guess they took the criticisms about the game being too easy to heart...and then went way too far in the opposite direction.  Some of the leaps of logic required make 90s adventure games look sensible in comparision and when combined with incessant back and forth travel between several recycled backgrounds from part 1, I became increasingly annoyed with the game.  Given the choice between the boredom of part 1 and the vexation of part 2, I think I'd have to choose the former.\n\nThe story gets a bit more interesting in that it explores more than the immediate task set before the characters, but then suffers from a great deal of world building backstory being crammed into a short period with no time to properly explore it.  I still also couldn't bring myself to particularly care about the characters who, being motivated primarily by a specific list of tasks set out for them, never really seem like actual characters so much as puzzle solving drones.  Once again, Vella is still better than Shay, but neither is close to being a Ben or Manny.","January 20, 2014","false","12.1"," 11 of 22 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","11","22","0","0"

This game is literally the reason I got into gaming (I saw the NPR piece about it and I knew I had to get my hands on something that lovely).\n\nStory:\nThe first half is fantastic story. In the documentary they pointed out that things really kick up once Merrick shows up and that's definitely true. You don't really know what is going on or who to trust. Then you have the end of the first half and the beginning of the second half.\n\nThe big mysteries in the first half are pretty quickly filled in within the second half but personally I loved the ways they were revealed (for one my husband was watching over my shoulder and exclaimed in surprise) and that the focus of the game was then executing specific tasks, rather than hunting for clues.\n\nI also really liked the ending; it reminded me strongly of the ending of Transistor with it's understated approach and use of the credits.\n\nOverall the story was just suspenseful/unnerving enough without being something I wouldn't recommend to younger players and fantastically winsome and memorable.\n\nCharacter Balance/Development:\nIn the first half Vella's world is more flat than Shay's. She's less clearly motivated and the objects she carries don't result in really any clever dialogue at all (as far as clicking on them in inventory, offering them to everyone, etc). Shay's world on the other hand was amazingly rich. The spoon and knife I didn't really discover until my second play through and they alone make his entire world more charming.\n\nIn the second half that's much more balanced. While Shay still has more interesting tasks since he isn't trapped as much in one locale, Vella picks up the knife and a fork and some new characters show up in her locale (along with an old one I was really hoping we hadn't seen the end of!) that give her more engagement. Shay has more of the "I don't think we can use that that way" lines in the second half.\n\nShay is in my opinion more rounded and makes more sense than Vella. We don't get a good sense of Vella without really digging into one or two lines; otherwise she comes off as needlessly and oddly intense. But they are both very winning and you feel a vested interest in them.\n\nOne thing character wise that bugged me in the second half was the fact that one character stands around on a beach and you can't really talk to him. His big issue is pretty easily solved and then he's just there for most of the game. If you try to talk to him you get the auto "Never mind!" line and have to walk away. That seemed really pointless.\n\nPuzzles:\nThey are definitely uneven but not unduly so. The first half of the game they are realizing things are not as they seem. The second half they are trying to cope with certain big revelations and new realities. It makes sense that other things are suddenly harder as well.\n\nI have NO idea why people hate the second half so much. The puzzles are clever but not so obscure that you would never get them (I found the knot puzzle easy while I would miss certain more obvious items, like how to get the shell). Most of the time if one side got old I would switch and play the other and suddenly things would make sense to me. So I felt like it played very smoothly. You need to diagram some things out but please, that's point and click standard. If you don't see that as the sign of a good game then don't play point and click.\n\nI also didn't understand the claims some have made about not having a hint system. When your character tells you "Maybe I should look for X" how is that NOT a hint? Same with your character asking another repeatedly if thing X will cause reaction Y.\n\nI like all others would have liked more new territory, but again, that's point and click standard to have one environment you really scrub over again and again. If it had all been released at once it would have been less striking.\n\nI know there's more I could say here but these were the reasons I got into the game and these are the only things that really matter to me. It's a gorgeous game that is incredibly addicting and charming. If this appeals to you at all, buy it! It's well worth every cent!","May 5, 2015","true","21.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Part 2 did not deliver in regards to puzzles, and has had mixed reactions to the story (which I'm personally neutral on, I can't bring myself to dislike it, but the ending is by no means satisfying either).\n\nI think I speak for the majority of players when it comes to one thing, at least:\nPart 2 was not fun. It is as simple as that. After over a year of waiting upon completing part 1, I'll damit, the story could have been fleshed out more, but ultimately that is a minor complaint when it comes to repetitive and convoluted puzzle design that gets in the way of the more logical, more straightforward, but simultaneously still-difficult puzzles that really provided a sense of achievement when you completed them instead of giving you a sigh of relief to finally be done - just to move on to that same laborious struggle.\n\nThat said, I believe this story is meritable if not for its puzzles, then for its artstyle and, in some part, story. This game is gorgeous from start to finish, in an artstyle that truly matches up to the very nature of the game and is pleasing simply to be walking through. That said, that is the only point that gets by without flaws, in my opinion. The music, whilst excellent, I found to be far too repetitive, although this likely comes from the fact that the puzzles in part 2 forced me to associate them with the unpleasant experience, which is really a pity.\n\nOn to the story. I will avoid any spoilers but I will say that I have seen complaints that the story does not continue with part 1's themes of teenage struggle. This, at least, I disagree with. Part 1 heavily showed through Shay's story the struggle of dealing with overprotective and overbearing parents, and Vella's shows dealing with living and dealing with life outside of parental influence (and to a more minor degree, dealing with parents' beliefs  and their contrast to her view of the world). Part 2, on the other hand, shows the point of view of their respective families, moreso, and allows for a less one-sided view on the issues. I feel like if not for this, the story may have had the opportunity to flesh out more interestingly, but thematically was essential to take players out of their comfort zone when it comes to understanding both sides of an issue that directly affects what I believe to be the majority of players. Some plot points were not fleshed out, but I personally feel that that would have pulled attention away from the themes of teenage struggle we otherwise have.\n\nBroken Age, for me, has sated my hunger for adventure games and kept me engaged in a story that remains focused and rooted in its themes. Whilst as a story, it is weak, and for the second half the puzzles are tedious and disappointing, a beautiful artstyle paired with a thematically focused narrative means Broken Age, for me, reamins worth playing.\nIt's no masterpiece, like I hoped that it could be, but it does just enough to make it worth playing through.","May 2, 2015","true","4.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Massive plot holes are introduced to the story, and the puzzles become convoluted and frustrating. I can't imagine ever solving the final puzzle without consulting a guide - something I never had to do in Act 1, or for any other part of Act 2. But the puzzles in Act 2 are everything that was wrong with adventure games in the 1990s. Double-fine paid too much attention to the hardcore player's feedback about Act 1's puzzles being easy and ramped up difficulty (i.e. moon logic) enough to kill the enjoyment for all the other players in Act 2.\n\nThe characters and world are still engaging, but everything else in Act 2 is a massive let down compared to the first Act of the game.\n\nI tenatively recommend the game if you can catch it on sale, just because Act 1 is so flawless and enjoyable, but Double-Fine dropped so many balls with Act 2 that it is a tragedy.","May 3, 2015","true","11.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I don't care how much money they got to work on it (in reference to the Kickstarter), as I gave none to that cause, so it's not quite my business, but I did buy this game for about $11 and 4 hours of gameplay is nowhere near worth that. They say there's a part 2 coming and most importatnly it IS free. But if you don't want to play half of the game and wait however many months it takes to be completed, which I don't know anyone who would (other than me because I have many other games to move on to) sort of like an episodic game except full-priced from the beginning, with only ONE free act announced, or like a season pass where you pay now and get dlc later, this is not for you. It seems like there is only one other act announced and if it's the same length as Act 1 and the only other act that gets released for free, this game is WAY overpriced, even the price for it on sale.\nTL;DR: In the modern age, 8 hours (assuming act two is the same length) of gameplay is not worth $11 not to mention $25. If they don't add more acts to make it an acceptable amount of gameplay/time (dependent on your opinion, but I think most agree that the time is not enough right now to justify the price), then the price is completely unfair, no matter what voice-actors they hired.\nMaybe, I'm spoiled by Steam sales and being able to buy very long and/or content-filled games for incredibly low prices (almost never buying a new, full-priced game) but you have to go with the flow of other developers.","January 4, 2015","false","8.8"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","10","20","0","2"

I played Act 1 about a year ago and I waited patiently for Act 2 to come. The ending of first act left me with so many questions, I had a bunch of theories going on in my head and was super excited to see if I got it. Well, turns out I didn't. The story turned out to be a bit more predictable than I would've liked. Remember that "Indoctrination Theory" of ME3 that we all rooted for and then it didn't happen? Kinda like that, but on a smaller scale.\n\nI recommended this game wholeheartedly after act 1, and made several people buy it just cause my enthusiasm was all over the place. Now I'm a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it IS a good adventure game, the characters are funny pretty much all the time and you'll get your lols and you'll scratch your head at some puzzles. The art is amazing too. And the voice acting. But in the end, most of us adventure games lovers want a good story. Something unpredictable that will make you go "aaaah!! ohhh!" not "oh, mmm okaaay". And let's not forget the ending, which was abrupt and I kinda wanted a bit more closure instead of dem credits rollin' and me hatin'.\n\nI will recommend this game because it's a good one all things considered. It's just not as good as I had imagined. So probably if you don't get your hopes up you'll enjoy it more.

Though the puzzles (with some exceptions, but I will get to those in a second) are really very easy, the game itself is extremely enjoyable; this is mostly due to the fully realized characters, the fantastic setting (which does start to dry out with the second part), and great humor and conversation.\n\nThat said, the second part saw a pretty large detour from the first. It starts off on a relatively weak note, with astonishingly stupid plot twists (such as that of Shay's family) and long lists of tasks that the player has to do. Though a dedicated player will get past this section without pause, it provides very little motivation to keep going. In Vella's case, for instance, your first task (with the zero-gravity re-enabled) involves more timing than it does any intelligence. After this sort of "introduction" to Part 2, you are immediately hit with the aforementioned long lists of tasks. At this point, your primary goal in Part 2 is to wander the countryside and click on everything. You are stopped every now and again for a bout of puzzle-solving, but it feels very much like the puzzles are mixed throughout a game of wandering aimlessly. Even the puzzles of Part 2 are of varying quality. There are some that take legitimate thinking and reward you with a great deal of satisfaction, but there are others that involve screwing around with wires on the back of a robot (I am aware that the solution is hidden in the setting, but it was really very obscure). More than that, however, a number of the puzzles require you to get solutions from the other protagonist's story. This is irritating, but only because there is never any indication that this is the case. This can lead to some serious jumps in logic, as seen in many early adventure games.\n\nThe setting, on the other hand, is absolutely fantastic. I won't say much about the setting, because figuring out more about it is probably the thing Broken Age does best.\n\nIs Broken Age worth your time and money? Yes, I would say that it is. Broken Age is a fun, lighthearted adventure game with less tedium than a number of classics; I recommend this to anyone interested in adventure games.","May 30, 2015","true","24.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

All top notch. The hand-painted art is consistently amazing, even breathtaking at times. The game runs and flows very smoothly with slick cuts between scenes. The ending of Act I left me in awe of what had just happened and hungry for more. Definitely a page-turner of a game.\n\nYet the game is unfortunately a victim of annoying, unintuitive and, at times, very frustrating "adventure game logic." The puzzles were mostly OK, but a few too many didn't quite work. Trying to use all your items on all environmental points of interest gets old fast. Some puzzles require solutions that aren't mentioned or taught to the player before (easy stuff like combining items, but in a specific and seemingly arbitrary order, and less obvious things that I won't spoil here.\n\nAnd the difficulty ramps up to 11 really fast near the end. It came out of nowhere, getting in the way of my enjoyment and destroying the pacing and flow of the experience. Lots of repetition if you fail to do exactly what the game expects, and it's not even clear why you're doing things. Is the player just supposed to do something because the game permits it, not because it's an obvious way forward?\n\nMaybe I just had a particularly bad time. I think I'll recommend this game in the end anyway. After all, walkthroughs exist (THANK GOD) to remove some of the frustration. I would never have finished it without looking up a few solutions. Don't be afraid to use one, and you may really like this game, as I did. Just expect some frustrating design, especially if you're not an avid point-and-click adventure game player.","March 2","true","9.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

So, for me, the first act was really great, the puzzles made sense and I only got really stuck once (but when I looked up the solution I was like 'damn, I'm an idiot'.\nThe story is really great, full of cool characters with good voice acting. The visuals are (with one subjective exception, see later) amazing, both backgrounds and characters and their animations. At the end of Act 1 I was like "whaaaaaaaat :-O".\n\nWhat I did not like: Most of the characters have a very prominent red noses that to me looked either as chronic alcoholics or a chimp attack victims with big gaping holes in their faces. I wanted to take a cool screenshot many times but I decided against it because I could not get over those noses.\n\nAct 2:\nThe story and audiovisuals are still good, although the story didn't feel as good as the first act's, but I felt the puzzles were now made a lot harder for some reason. And the worst of them (the wiring) had a randomized solution so you could not quickly be done with it by looking up the solution. I admit I had one guide open in the overlay most of the second act. Really, look up the guide called 'Act 2 hints' or similar, it gives you a lot of spoilered hints so you can still solve the puzzle yourself if the first hint kicks you in the head.\n\n----\n\nMy favorite characters: Marek, the Dead Eye Druids, that little fella from the cloud town. Well, the two main characters were great too I guess.\n----\n\nAct 1: 3.5 golden sloths\nAct 2: 4 silver sloths","June 24, 2015","true","7.8"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","8","16","0","2"

I played Act 1 about a year ago and I waited patiently for Act 2 to come. The ending of first act left me with so many questions, I had a bunch of theories going on in my head and was super excited to see if I got it. Well, turns out I didn't. The story turned out to be a bit more predictable than I would've liked. Remember that "Indoctrination Theory" of ME3 that we all rooted for and then it didn't happen? Kinda like that, but on a smaller scale.\n\nI recommended this game wholeheartedly after act 1, and made several people buy it just cause my enthusiasm was all over the place. Now I'm a bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong, it IS a good adventure game, the characters are funny pretty much all the time and you'll get your lols and you'll scratch your head at some puzzles. The art is amazing too. And the voice acting. But in the end, most of us adventure games lovers want a good story. Something unpredictable that will make you go "aaaah!! ohhh!" not "oh, mmm okaaay". And let's not forget the ending, which was abrupt and I kinda wanted a bit more closure instead of dem credits rollin' and me hatin'.\n\nI will recommend this game because it's a good one all things considered. It's just not as good as I had imagined. So probably if you don't get your hopes up you'll enjoy it more.

Though the puzzles (with some exceptions, but I will get to those in a second) are really very easy, the game itself is extremely enjoyable; this is mostly due to the fully realized characters, the fantastic setting (which does start to dry out with the second part), and great humor and conversation.\n\nThat said, the second part saw a pretty large detour from the first. It starts off on a relatively weak note, with astonishingly stupid plot twists (such as that of Shay's family) and long lists of tasks that the player has to do. Though a dedicated player will get past this section without pause, it provides very little motivation to keep going. In Vella's case, for instance, your first task (with the zero-gravity re-enabled) involves more timing than it does any intelligence. After this sort of "introduction" to Part 2, you are immediately hit with the aforementioned long lists of tasks. At this point, your primary goal in Part 2 is to wander the countryside and click on everything. You are stopped every now and again for a bout of puzzle-solving, but it feels very much like the puzzles are mixed throughout a game of wandering aimlessly. Even the puzzles of Part 2 are of varying quality. There are some that take legitimate thinking and reward you with a great deal of satisfaction, but there are others that involve screwing around with wires on the back of a robot (I am aware that the solution is hidden in the setting, but it was really very obscure). More than that, however, a number of the puzzles require you to get solutions from the other protagonist's story. This is irritating, but only because there is never any indication that this is the case. This can lead to some serious jumps in logic, as seen in many early adventure games.\n\nThe setting, on the other hand, is absolutely fantastic. I won't say much about the setting, because figuring out more about it is probably the thing Broken Age does best.\n\nIs Broken Age worth your time and money? Yes, I would say that it is. Broken Age is a fun, lighthearted adventure game with less tedium than a number of classics; I recommend this to anyone interested in adventure games.","May 30, 2015","true","24.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

So, for me, the first act was really great, the puzzles made sense and I only got really stuck once (but when I looked up the solution I was like 'damn, I'm an idiot'.\nThe story is really great, full of cool characters with good voice acting. The visuals are (with one subjective exception, see later) amazing, both backgrounds and characters and their animations. At the end of Act 1 I was like "whaaaaaaaat :-O".\n\nWhat I did not like: Most of the characters have a very prominent red noses that to me looked either as chronic alcoholics or a chimp attack victims with big gaping holes in their faces. I wanted to take a cool screenshot many times but I decided against it because I could not get over those noses.\n\nAct 2:\nThe story and audiovisuals are still good, although the story didn't feel as good as the first act's, but I felt the puzzles were now made a lot harder for some reason. And the worst of them (the wiring) had a randomized solution so you could not quickly be done with it by looking up the solution. I admit I had one guide open in the overlay most of the second act. Really, look up the guide called 'Act 2 hints' or similar, it gives you a lot of spoilered hints so you can still solve the puzzle yourself if the first hint kicks you in the head.\n\n----\n\nMy favorite characters: Marek, the Dead Eye Druids, that little fella from the cloud town. Well, the two main characters were great too I guess.\n----\n\nAct 1: 3.5 golden sloths\nAct 2: 4 silver sloths","June 24, 2015","true","7.8"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","8","16","0","2"

It contains a high amount of polish and should give you a good 10 hours or so of gameplay. There are some flaws, but I found it to a challenging and fun experience. I think it works well to play it in small periods and take breaks so you do not get too frustrated.\n\nPros:\nGraphics: Beautiful hand painted game. Each area and character looks distinct. Since they are all painted, the game will probably still look good years from now.\n\nSound: Fully orchestrated score and high quality voice acting. The personality of the charcters come alive through their dialogue. The investments and time they spent on the music and voice acting really pays off, especially with the main characters.\n\nGameplay: Game is point and click and functions with a vareity of controller options including touch screen. The standard game play is to travel to different areas and solve puzzles to further the game's plot. The puzzles start off fairly easy and progress in difficulty towards the end of the game. Most are fairly fun and can be solved by following established mechanics or using information from items/characters. A few near the end can frustate you, but even then the game tries to give you hints for these. So if you get annoyed, take a break and clear your head. There are some fun chemistry puzzles and ones that use SAT question like logic and even one that involve tree jokes. Near the end, I needed to take pictures of some of the clues, so have your phone or paper handy.\n\nStory: The story is fairly straightfoward and a bit flawed, but the characters and dialogue really shine. Vella is one of the best female protagonist I have seen in a game for a long time. Shay shows some nice growth throughout the game and brings a nice opposing view to the world compared to Vella. All the side characters are are fun to talk to and will make you laugh. In fact every side character feels unique and memorable. Some highlights for me include the tree , the space weaver, and vella's family.\n\nCons:\nGameplay: The puzzles are interesting, and the game tries to give you hints, but it can be inconsistent about it. One of the aspects I did not like is that its not always obvious when you cannot yet complete a task/puzzle. Some puzzles require other ones to be completed first before you can solve them. The game is not great in explaining this always, so you can feel like stuck and frustrated when trying to solve a puzzle when you simply need some item from another puzzle first. So dont focus too much on anyone puzzle, try switching characters and tasks from time to time. Some puzzles are great at giving you hints and even teleporting you where you need to go if you mess up, but others seem to only clue you in once. Stacking had a nice hint system that might be helpful in this game. I think several big site reviews are frustrated by the boot, knot, and wire puzzles. The wire one is probably the most challenging though the game does try to give you some hints.\n\nGraphics: There not many new areas in Act 2. Most of the places you visited in Act 1 you will see again in Act 2, but through a differing perspective. There are a few new places, but do not expect a lot of new art. All of the characters have new dialogue at least.\n\nStory: The story does not feel entirely complete. On the surface it works and is satisfying enough, but the game definitely leaves a lot of questions about the world and its history. The characters go through their arcs and complete their goals, but there is a lot left for the player to fill in.  It definitely feels like changes were made or story was cut for the sake of time/money. The final puzzle is fun to solve, but from a story perspective, it feels like the motivations could have been better explained.","May 9, 2015","true","30.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I don't think it's perfect, but neither do I see a sharp decline in quality if compared to Act 1. Let me tell you why I think so (spoiler-free, of course):\n\nAct 1 has absolutely funny dialogue, bizarre characters and a twist at the end that once left me hungry for more, but it lacked clever puzzles. True, Act 2 doesn't have as many surprises when it comes to the story and yes, most areas you'll visit have already been established before, but its dialogue and its characters is still absurdly funny, and its puzzle design is absolutely great and much more challenging. Of course, the solutions to some puzzles are so creative that you might silently shout "How the hell should I have known that?" but COME ON, Monkey Island 2 wasn't all nicely logical either, and I'm not going to start talking about the puzzles from the Runaway series ;)\n\nI understand why critics might be disappointed in what Broken Age has turned out to be, but that is not because Broken Age would be a bad game - on the contrary, you feel the love that Double Fine have poured into it, and it's still one of the best adventures I've played in the last decade. Critics are polarised because people got too hyped. It happens.\n\n\nI think you will like Broken Age if...\n+ you like the old LucasArts adventures or adventures in general\n+ you enjoy the Schaferian sense of humour\n+ you liked the other DoubleFine games for its dialogue, story, characters or artstyle (especially Psychonauts or Brütal Legend)\n+ you haven't played Act 1 before and therefore are open to perceiving it as a whole game, not two separate parts\n\nI probably wouldn't recommend it if...\n- you love your adventure game puzzles completely rational\n- you hate revisiting old places\n- you're impatient when solving puzzles\n- you're expecting a five-act-blockbuster with a life-changing story","April 30, 2015","true","14.6"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

All top notch. The hand-painted art is consistently amazing, even breathtaking at times. The game runs and flows very smoothly with slick cuts between scenes. The ending of Act I left me in awe of what had just happened and hungry for more. Definitely a page-turner of a game.\n\nYet the game is unfortunately a victim of annoying, unintuitive and, at times, very frustrating "adventure game logic." The puzzles were mostly OK, but a few too many didn't quite work. Trying to use all your items on all environmental points of interest gets old fast. Some puzzles require solutions that aren't mentioned or taught to the player before (easy stuff like combining items, but in a specific and seemingly arbitrary order, and less obvious things that I won't spoil here.\n\nAnd the difficulty ramps up to 11 really fast near the end. It came out of nowhere, getting in the way of my enjoyment and destroying the pacing and flow of the experience. Lots of repetition if you fail to do exactly what the game expects, and it's not even clear why you're doing things. Is the player just supposed to do something because the game permits it, not because it's an obvious way forward?\n\nMaybe I just had a particularly bad time. I think I'll recommend this game in the end anyway. After all, walkthroughs exist (THANK GOD) to remove some of the frustration. I would never have finished it without looking up a few solutions. Don't be afraid to use one, and you may really like this game, as I did.

It's amazing in every aspect! Where should i start? The virusals.. the musical score.. the voice acting.. Just the very first scene of Vella waking up under a tree sets the tone for the rest of the adventure. It's enchanting. It's like watching your very first cartoons with children's eyes. There are quite enough puzzle, mostly very easy, but the adventure focusses more on the dialogues which you souldn't miss a single line as they are so well written and acted. Elijah Wood, Jack Black, Will Wheaton, ... even Pendleton Ward is in it :)  For the french speaking person i am not very much used to recognize english actors by their voice, i was surprised and pleased to recognize them in the game! The subtitles are very well translated, by the way. Really, it praises quality ... over quantity, which is the game's only downside. The game is very short (typical for point'n'click adventure games) and Act2 isn't even released yet, but it will be soon and for free. I just can't wait for it.

Finally earlier this year the second episode finally came out.\n\nBroken Age is a point-and-click game. The game features two characters, each located in different worlds. You can switch between the two characters at any time you want at the click of a button, other than this; the characters don’t have any real interaction. It has all the usual adventurey type things such as an inventory and very good dialog options.\n\nThe game looks absolutely gorgeous, animations are all done brilliantly too. Music and voice acting is all top notch.\n\nAs with most point and click games, you have to have some nicely put together puzzles, and Broken Age certainly delivers, they aren't so hard that you are stuck for hours trying to work it out, but they aren't so easy that you can do it without thinking. I won't spoil anything with regards to the story, but it is beautifully written, and the characters are some of the most likable I have ever encountered in a video game.\n\nThis is one of those games you just have to have in your library, its fun and worth the time and adventure.

The art style is amazing and the high quality voiceovers contribute greatly to the game.  The second act starts to fall apart as they reuse nearly all assets and locations from the first act, and resort to simple item swapping puzzles (fetch quests, effectively) across multiple characters and NPCs to stretch the length (seemingly).  The end of the second act, if you can even call it that, is about 5 minutes long and consists of several scenes of exposition and a fairly poorly explained 'ending', where you get little to no actual information about what is going on, just a brief explanation and then credits.\n\nThe villain provides little to no motivation outside from one sentence as to why he is doing what he is doing, and even then, never explains at all why he has chosen the specific path he took to complete his action.  He exists almost solely as diabolus ex machina for the plot.  His motivation is unclear until the very end, and even then it seems completely weakly written.\n\nSave your $ unless this becomes extremely cheap.  There is no real pay-off at the end, you spend a lot of time getting excited about a few things that you never end up seeing and that never get explained, only to get a really short throwaway ending that exists solely to tie up one or two plot threads while leaving many, many others dangling.","January 8","false","15.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

Also, as expected, the gameplay is very simple and not challenging.\n\nInititally scheduled to be released as one game it was split into two parts when the developers ran out of money. That was very damaging to this game and it ends just when it starts to become a bit more interesting.\n\nDespite what was claimed in the original kickstarter video, adventure games are not dead, they never were. It's a genre that is thriving with many innovative titles.

In short: it was an intimate experience, and I have much better understanding as a gamer about how the other side of the coin operates.\n\nI played Broken Age all the way through in one sitting - due to the anticipation from fans, I felt it was most appropriate to play it that way since serveral people complained about the "broken" experience where they whizzed through Act 1, then waited, waited, waited, got impatient, then brute-forced Act 2. If your experience was like that, I'm sorry you feel hatred towards this game, but your particular experience casued your particular reaction. The game, while it may feel unevenly paced, is still an enjoyable game in what many modern gamers consider to be "A dying genre". Adventure games are here to stay, as long as people play them, classics, remakes, or modern ones, it makes no difference.\n\nThe art direction is great, the music is excellent, the animation (while not Disney calibur), fits the artwork appropriately and tolerable. The mechanics are as-expected for a Point-and-Click adventure, along with controller support (if that's your thing). The story is interesting enough to keep you moving ahead, even if some puzzles are frustrating until you look up hints or draw a diagram on a post-it or two (like I did for that Hexpals wiring puzzle) - it only makes you more satisfied once you finish. Depending on your first playthrough, you may or may not want to do it again to snag all of the achievements (for you Perfectionists/Completionists/Achievement Hunters out there).\n\nOverall, if you love the magic of Double Fine games, if you love Adventure games, if you like games that try to do something different and pray somebody will appreciate it, play this game. Whether you come to love it or hate it, at least acknowledge the money, the hard work, and most of all, the love that Tim Schafer and friends put into the game.\n\nIt's worth the experience.","July 22, 2015","true","14.0"," 14 of 29 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","14","29","0","0"

I enjoyed it overall. I was torn between a thumbs up or thumbs down on this. In the end I went thumbs down partially because it is over-rated and just average. The game doesn't bring anything new to the table, nor does it "hearken back to the days of yore" or whatever.\nIf you are excited about the optional 8-bit mode, this game is for you! This is a gaming hipsters dream.\nThere really isn't too much gameplay, most of your time is spent watching the story unfold because you clicked on one of the handful of things you could click on.\nThe hardest puzzle in the game was figuring out the UI. The minimalist design is initially very confusing. (probably very intuitive on a touchscreen device)\nThis isn't a bad game, and you wouldn't hate yourself for playing it.\nI like the idea of being able to switch between the two stories, but it would have made more sense if there was a point in switching between them. When I discovered you could switch, I assumed I would somehow find clues for one story inside the other story or something.\nHad I not read how short the game was, I probably wouldn't have bothered finishing. It wasn't until the end that I was actually intrigued.\nAccording to the IGN rating, this game "ushered in a new age of point-and-click" that is absolutely false. if you're wanting a point-and-click adventure that takes the genre to a new level, play The Walking Dead, another game from Telltale.","January 17, 2014","false","5.5"," 13 of 27 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","13","27","0","0"

Fantastic art style, great and dedicated music score, interesting world and story, great voice acting. Some chuckles here and there thrown in for good measure. To people worried if Double Fine delivered, I say, yes, they did, it's pretty worthwhile experience.\n\nCan't wait for second act! I mean, act 1 is a complete experience, if maybe on the shorter side, but it definitely leaves you craving for more. And, sort of.. for what it is now, even though I said "worthwhile", I can't shake the feeling it should cost less xD But the purchase does contain the second act once it comes out, it's just not released yet, so be aware of that.\n\nI have to say though that I am dissapointed with the puzzle side. Exploration, wonder, amusement, enjoynment of vistas and music and story etc - that is there, but having to think? Not really. Puzzles take an obvious backseat compared to the other mentioned elements. There are not that many things to do and not that many items at your disposal to do it and to me it was always pretty obvious what to do next and how to do it, can't fathom why they are actually making it even more obvious with hints from other characters. I think Telltale's Sam & Max series hit the puzzle difficulty nail better (avoiding the frustration of unfair puzzles of yore but not being too obvious, either).\n\nThere is no question if it is a game or not like you might question something like To The Moon, as the gameplay/puzzles are above being just nominal, but I kind of expected more from them. Nonetheless, I did enjoy the ride and I heartily recommend it to others.

It exudes charm, humor, and lightness in only the way Tim Schafer and crew know how to do it. And it's so wonderful to see a point and click adventure game like this, in this day and age, harkening back to Schafer's older, most respected works. On top of that the art is brilliant, the voice acting top notch, the script clever and hilarious, and so many fun little easter eggs all over the place. I spent a good portion of the game just talking to everyone and combining every kind of item just to hear the knee-jerk responses. Double Fine are some of the best comic writers in the entertainment biz, games or otherwise.\n\nThe only downsides are those typical of point and click games. Some objects really do blend in with the background too well, you'll do lots of backtracking, various puzzles need to be solved in very specific order, etc. I must admit I did have to use a guide later in the game as some of the puzzle solutions were just not obvious enough after lots of back and forth trying out many different things. I can't really fault the developers for this, as I think these sorts of games do need to have some tougher puzzles, not everything can be elementary. Certainly nowhere near as perplexing and complicated as some of Machinarium's puzzles.\n\nI can't recommend it enough!!","July 31, 2015","true","12.2"," 9 of 19 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","9","19","0","0"

However, it's far too short and pretty much incomplete. I won't go ballistic about the injustice of how the community invested a ♥♥♥♥ ton of money into a kickstarter and only got a small part of what was promised to them; I didn't participate in that kickstarter and I only recently bought it, about a month before the release of Act II, so I can't really comment on that.\n\nIf I had to grade it as a standalone game, I certainly wouldn't recommend it; it being an incomplete experience. But considering how the second installation is right around the corner, and how intensely I enjoyed the two meager hours of gameplay this first miniature installation had to offer, I will recommend it heartily anyway.\n\nAs a caveat though, I have to say it's probably not for everyone. It's not incredibly thought-provoking, nor is it a particularly thrilling gameplay experience. It's just a charming adventure game that some might write off as childish and lackluster. And while I'd disagree with such a negative judgement, I can understand why some would think of it as such.\n\nI loved it. Will you?

Multi-layered puzzles that actually makes you think, still not as hard as old-school adventure games, but much better than the first act, where each solution had only one step. I find the solutions to puzzles to be more in the "Aha! That makes sense" column than in the "WTF!" column.\n\nStory:\nThe game has great characters and a good story. I wish the game was longer at the end, so it would flesh out the bad guys more. Maybe even more scenes/puzzles in the city.\n\nArt:\nWhen the art was first revealed, I wasnt really sure about. Truth be told, I expected the art style to be closer to Full Throttle or Day of the Tentacle, but it grew on me and now I really like it. I can't imagine that it would look some other way\n\nReally?:\nThis is a hint for the second act, so if you do not want to read it, stop. Half the fun is finding out on your own. Though there are some players that don't like it. In the second act, you can get hints about puzzles from the other character's point of view. The characters dont interact, but you can switch between the characters and notice some details in Veila's part which help you solve a puzzle in Shay's part. It really comes out of the blue and you basically have to figure it own on your own. This didn't frustrate me or anything, but I can understand that some gamers are annoyed by this. I don't know, maybe it's the mileage of playing adventure games.\n\nIf you want to play a great adventure game, buy it. This game made me laugh and lately adventure games don't really try to do that or they just think they're funny (Deponia).\n\nPlus, watch the credits, there is some nice art there ;)","July 31, 2015","true","17.4"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","8","17","0","0"

It's quite childish, but not in a way I think children would enjoy. The girl's story was somewhat engaging, but the boys side just failed to capture my imagination. Perhaps it was having to repeat the same 'quest' and dialog options multiple times. I get it, I'm supposed to feel like the boy who is bored out of his mind by endless repetition. Mission accomplished. Even when things started to pick up, the boy's lack of concern (or even moment of pause) that something has changed was too much for me to handle.\n\nAgain, I didn't really get too deep into the game, so maybe it picks up a little later, but I also found the gameplay completely lacking. The objects you need to find are basically handed to you, and what you need to do with them is painfully obvious for an adventure game.

Beautiful artwork, fun & interesting characters, quirky settings, and the layers within layers of "twists" in the plot were fun even though they were pretty obvious [to me].\n\nWith the full game in perspective, the "half" formerly known as "Act I" feels more like a prologue; it teaches you the interface, introduces the characters, setting, and plot, and it isn't until you reach "Act II" that the game really seems to begin. The game wouldn't work at all without the first act, but its value doesn't really become clear until you reach the second.\n\nHaving recently played through some "classic" adventure games (e.g.: Monkey Island 1 & 2), I am grateful for the advancements of modern gaming & interface (thank goodness verbs are gone!) design, while still challenged by some of the puzzles and sometimes-tiny-and-obscure clues. In my opinion, Double Fine is taking adventure games in the right direction and, with all the time & effort they've invested in the engine, I look forward to seeing more adventure games from them in coming years.","April 27, 2015","true","16.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jakerockwell/recommended/232790/","jakerockwell","jrx","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jakerockwell/","2200 products in account","Broken Age is an adventure game by Double Fine that was initially funded via Kickstarter in 2012. Now in 2015, the game is finally fully released! But the question is: does it deliver?\n\nThe story describes the coming of age of a boy (Shay) and girl (Vella). You get to play with both characters by alternating their storylines, which are interwoven in a clever way. After a certain point, alternating between characters becomes essential for progressing in the game. I found the story compelling and it motivated me to keep playing the game.\n\nThe puzzles in the game use the classic object manipulation and character interaction staples from the adventure game genre, which are executed in a appropriate and traditional way. Unfortunately, some puzzles do suffer from being too easy or having an unclear context. A bit more polish here and there would have definitely made all puzzles great. Overall, I enjoyed solving the puzzles.\n\nFrom a visual perspective, Broken age has a unique and nice art style, which is definitely a selling point. Animations are crisp and the world feels very much alive thanks to a quirky cast of characters with great voice actors. The ambience the game breathes is great and it is an enjoyable environment to walk around in.\n\nThe soundtrack is also very enjoyable and it always suited the mood for the story.\n\nIn conclusion, from the perspective of an adventure game player, Broken Age might feel underwhelming, since it never tries to go beyond the classic adventure game mold. What remains is a charming game that any gamer with an open mind can appreciate, given its sense of adventure and positive spirit.","April 28, 2015","true","18.9"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","7","15","0","0"

Broken Age is finally out. I haven't touched it before tonight (bought it sometime last year during a sale) and waited patiently for it to be ready for a full-on, one-session playthrough. The question is: Was it worth the wait?\n\nThe (spoiler-free) answer to that is: Yes it was, if you have been patient and didn't raise your expectations too high.\n\n\nNow, something to say right away - Broken Age is not the adventure to end all adventures. It has its strengths and weaknesses. But what makes assessing them hard is that they switch around. In Act 1, the story was very strong and somewhat mysterious while the puzzles were mostly fairly easy. In Act 2, the story lost a lot of its pull (in my opinion) but the puzzles became more complex and challenging, some of them just the right amount to be satisfying, some pushing it a little (or well) into the realm of the frustrating.\n\nBut I will not blame Double Fine for experimenting with some of the concepts behind puzzles. The fewer developers keep recycling the same concept, content and game over and over, the better, so I can admit I was satisfied with that part of the game even though I eventually had to look up a hint or two.\n\nThe story left a somewhat bitter aftertaste, though. It's not that it's bad overall - The presentation is brilliant, the setup stellar (particularly Shay's Act 1 was great) and the cast of experienced and skilled (voice) actors add to it, as do the beatiful soundtrack and catching visuals. And the writing also doesn't leave a lot to be desired: It's witty, but not too over-the-top and just the right amount of educational to be played by all ages.\nIt does, however, suffer from what I would call the "Mass Effect 3" effect: By the end, it seems like nobody really knew what to do with it, so it was just wrapped up in whatever way they could. It's not as bad as Mass Effect 3 but I found the conclusion unsatisfying and the last few scenes made me wonder where the good writing with its surprises and twists had gone and why I was now watching a B movie.\n\nI know that doesn't sound like a hearty recommendation but that doesn't mean you shouldn't pick it up. Broken Age is still a great adventure; it just isn't without faults, just like the story of its development.\n\nBe aware, though, that you are probably only going to get one playthrough of 8-10 hours out of it (maybe another some years later). But during a sale, this is a good pick.","April 28, 2015","true","10.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/recommended/232790/","Harley365","Harley365","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Harley365/","213 products in account","Broken Age represents the return of the classic “point-and-click” adventure game; it promised to feature the same wit, humor, and odd-ball puzzles that made games like The Secret of Monkey Island and Day of the Tentacle such timeless classics. I grew up during the hey-day of the point-and-click computer games and still have a box filled with floppy discs for games such as Monkey Island, Monkey Island 2 and Day of the Tentacle. My sense of humor was shaped by the comedy that Tim Schafer and Ron Gilbert wrote into their games.\n\nNow, after a controversial development, Broken Age arrives in full on the PlayStation Vita making one thing absurdly clear: it makes good on everything it promised. It is an adventure game that is as deep and rich as any I’ve ever played.\n\n2015-04-27-043646\n\nBroken Age tells the story of two young adults with one thing in common; they’re unhappy with their lot in life. Shay is a young man who has spent his life aboard a spaceship and has had his every need catered to by an overly mothering computer. The only excitement in his day is when he embarks on scripted expeditions to “rescue” creatures in peril. Day after day his life trudges on the same, and day after day he goes through the same charade – wishing each time there was something more.\n\nVella is a young woman who lives in a village of bakers. Every 14 years the village offers up the best maidens in town as an offering to a horrible monster that ravages their land. Despite having such an honor bestowed upon her, Vella wonders why the people of her village cower in fear rather than fight the beast. She has chosen not to be a sacrifice; she has chosen for something better in life.\n\n2015-04-21-161855\n\nShay and Vella are both unhappy with where their lives are going, but they also question what is real in the world around them. More than anything, what they really want, is to peer behind the curtain and discover the truth.\n\nThe story in Broken Age is a deep and philosophical one that ironically doesn’t take itself too seriously. Shay lives on a spaceship where his companions are all knitted out of yarn, while Vella comes from a place where young women compete to be eaten by a monster. It’s the juxtaposition of these conflicting ideas that brings an elevated sense of humor to the story…\n\nWow, that was deep. What I’m trying to say is that despite the underlying story, the surface is full of wild and wacky elements that are not only fun but hilariously funny. Often times this humor is derived from our two naïve heroes entering strange, new situations. Shay is a bit of a bumbling hero, much in the vain of Guybrush Threepwood from Monkey Island, while Vella is a headstrong go-getter with only one thing on her mind. Their dry comments in the oddest of situations would frequently make me laugh out loud, sometimes uncontrollably.\n\nAnd it’s good to have a sense of humor when playing a puzzle game like this. The puzzles presented in Broken Age feel very familiar and fresh at the same time. They’re the same twisted puzzles I grew up with where clues hide in plain sight and the answer is often more absurd than you’d think. Sometimes these puzzles get solved in a matter of minutes while other times you may have to think about them for a few hours.\n\n2015-04-23-080526\n2015-04-21-194850\nThe game is broken up into two acts. Act I introduces us to our two protagonists and allows us to guide them on a new adventure. You can play as either Shay or Vella and switch between them at any time. The puzzles are challenging with a number of “A-ha!” moments, but it goes by rather quickly.\n\nAct II starts with you having to deal with the consequences of your earlier actions. Shay and Vella want to peer behind the curtain, but what do they do once they have? The second act is much longer than the first and the puzzles get more intense. In total it took me around 13 hours to complete the entire game.\n\nThe interface for the game was designed with a PC in mind, and while it does make the transition to a controller fairly well, it still feels a bit awkward at times since you use the thumb sticks to move an on-screen cursor and interact with the environment. A nice feature is that the right stick will automatically snap to “clickable” objects so you don’t have to scan the entire room for something to click. It works decent enough, but it’s still not very precise. However, the PS Vita does have an advantage over the PS4 version – you can use the touchscreen to select items in the game. It works amazingly well and really speeds things up.\n\n2015-04-25-083347\n\nVisually, the game is absolutely stunning. The 2-D art style retains the feeling of the pixilated adventure games of old but adds a brilliant layer that creates a hand-drawn look to the game. The characters have a bold and unique style to them and the environmental art is all top notch. Everything runs smoothly with the performance never being a problem.\n\nLikewise, the voice acting is superb. With notable talents such as Elijah Wood, Jack Black, and Wil Wheaton (whom I didn’t even recognize until the credits rolled), the characters are all given a great sense of depth and humor. And as good as the acting is, the musical score is even better. It’s composition is grand in ambition at times befitting the heroes’ journey, but it can also be tender and intimate. It’s by far one of my favorite game scores to come out in a long time.\n\n2015-04-23-074403\n\nAs great as Broken Age is, it’s not perfect. I often had trouble with the audio late in the game where the characters would speak but audio would be delayed for several seconds (or get drowned out by other noises). It’s a problem that happened in isolated areas but it was persistent. It also appears to be a Vita issue as the same problem would not occur on the PS4. I also had problems with the game crashing occasionally which seemed to go hand-in-hand with the Vita losing a connection to PSN.\n\nAny other issues I could point to would be nit-picking. It would be nice if there were more areas to explore, and it would be cool if the world felt a little bigger. Some characters get criminally underused while others get a bit too much screen time. In the end, I found it clever how the story would weave back into itself and reuse a lot of the same locations.\n\nBroken Age is a masterpiece. It manages to capture everything that made point-and-click adventure games great in the first place. It is the perfect blend of interesting characters, wacky humor, and head-scratching puzzles that constantly have you wanting more, and represents everything that made these games so wonderful to play.\n\nREVIEW OVERVIEW\nPresentation	5/5\nGameplay	5/5\nLasting Appeal	4.5/5\nExecution	5/5\n\nSUMMARY\nBroken Age promised to be a return to the classic point-and-click adventure games from yesteryear and manages to succeed on that promise in every way. It's a game filled with brilliantly absurd puzzles wrapped around a beautiful story that's told with wit and humor. It is both laugh out loud funny and head banging frustration. Broken Age manages to blend all these elements into a wonderfully charming game that should not be missed.\n\n4.9/5\n","January 11","true","1.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

The sotry is entertaining, the puzzles are enjoyable, its not very hard though.

There has been no news, no videos, absolutely nothing. In fact he has released other games in the same time, some how I have a feeling that Act 2 will never be published and that infuriates me. I have lost all faith in the developer and after being funded many times over on Kickstarter ther really is no excuse for why Act 2 could not be relased, its pathetic. Let alone to promise a date when it would be done, and then to juyst say nothing about it and later change the date once again with no information.

Tim Schafer's Double Fine Adventure game, Broken Age (act 1) has finally landed! After being successfully funded on Mar 13, 2012. It landed today. And I have to say... holy crap that was bad.\nThat was three hours of semi humorous adventure point-and-click game play. It was not particularly exciting or hilarious or anything I expected from it considering who was making it and how much money they had to make it with (asked for $400k, received $3.33 million).\n\nThe art, and sound, and voice acting, and just about everything that individually make up a great game were pretty much all amazing.  That said... The pinnacle of the game was a hipster lumberjack woodworker making a comment after he makes a stool for you that you can have it because he likes to spread his samples around.\n\nI'm not kidding. The height of the game was a poop joke.\n\nEvery individual piece was put together nicely, but they combined to make a rather lackluster and incredibly short game.  I understand this is only act 1, and act 2 will come out, oh, sometime, eventually, but even knowing there's going to be a sequel, the ending to this game is a giant middle finger to everyone who's been waiting for two years to play it.\n\nAs it took me maybe three hours of actual gameplay to finish this without looking anything up (it says I've had it open for 4.1 total at time of writing), I cannot recommend this in its current state. Wait until act 2 is available and play it straight through (assuming act 2 actually ends up with a decent ending).","January 19, 2014","false","4.1"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

Hmm. First off, it's so beautiful. SO beautiful. I can see why I paid full-price for it after knowing hardly anything and watching the trailer. The game is just as beautiful as the trailer looks, with a whole lot of tiresome monotony thrown in.\n\nBroken Age is split into two acts. Act One has fairly simple puzzles which follow the fun story. Vella and Shay, the two main characters, each inhabit their own world with no knowledge of the other (but you know that's gonna change). Playing either character is possible at any time. In Act Two, Vella and Shay switch worlds, and while each world is expanded on and new characters introduced, the puzzles became so tedious and not-obvoius, I found myself walking around the same places over and over.\n\nThe puzzles were tough in a way that didn't feel very stimulating, or creative, or challenging. Just sort of a shiny cute laborious thing to sludge through, with the help of walkthroughs that I very quickly turned to. I really want to make this sound more positive than I am, but I think the best part of the game for me was finishing, haha. Being done brought a feeling of satisfaction and relief that the game itself mostly hadn't.\n\nI did find Vella and Shay both to be interesting characters, largely because they're their own people and don't align so much with gender stereotypes. That said, a lot of other characters are pretty cliche and boring. Like, there are some married parents in Act Two, and the mom's main activity seems to be worrying about her kid, while the dad is gettin' all scientific with the PH balance of a mud puddle and patching holes in a spaceship.\n\nI recommend buying Broken Age on sale, taking lots of screenshots, enjoying Elijah Wood's voice (as Shay), turning to walkthroughs as wanted, and maybe having the snacks you like best nearby. Because this game, like any, is a whole lot better with some nice ridged chips and a towel to wipe the grease.","December 16, 2015","false","11.4"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","0"

For those new to the genre of point and click adventure games, you explore and solve puzzles within a highly stylized environment as action and narrative gradually unfolds. Understandably, there are both strong and weak points to this style. Since the genre has been around for three decades, the weaknesses have integrated themselves into the appeal of the game. There is an audience who enjoys having ten unique items in a sack and endlessly manipulating them to unravel the story. Other games, such as Telltale's Walking Dead and The Wolf Among Us, estimate the majority of the greater potential audience dislikes this style of Trial and Error, and streamlines the experience.\n\nThus, I will cut right to the chase, Broken Age is consciously archaec. If you have played Monkey Island, The Longest Journey, or Grim Fandago, you know exactly what to expect, since you have played this game before. The story unfolds along an intriguing ark, you obtain and interact with ten items in a sack, appealing humor and characters are involved, and the overall experience is entertaining, moving, and of high quality. If you are new to the genre, and are open minded toward it. Broken Age is one of the Top Grade titles of its class. Tim Schafer himself is a product of the Steven Speilberg, Disney-Pixar, Nintendo craze of the 80's and 90's, and his work is a luminous reflection of his influences. Schafer does have a few off-beat conventions in his style, which you would not expect from a Disney or Nintendo show, but his games deviate only a couple of steps from first base.\n\nDid I enjoy Broken Age? Yes, I was entertained and moved. Is it a classic of the overall genre? As much as Grim Fandago or Monkey Island is in my mind. Would I recommend it to someone else? If you like Tim Schafer's product, then yes, if you have not enjoyed his Adventure Games in the past, there will be nothing here to dissuade you from your prior bias. If you haven't played an adventure game before and you like the Speilberg-Disney-Pixar-Nintendo product, Broken Age is a good place to start and you will have a great time.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenize/recommended/232790/","ravenize","Ravenize > *","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ravenize/","338 products in account","Broken Age was the very first project I backed on Kickstarter. As such, it will always have a special place in my heart. It also revived my interest in adventure games, which I didn't think possible in my old, jaded age, but it's a consequence of the game that will stay with me long after the game itself is finished, which is an impressive feat.\n\nThe first act is a love song to 2D adventure games. There are tropes that play out like you'd expect and others turned totally upside down. It's fun and light-hearted and whimsical. You won't find another voice cast including the likes of Jack Black and Wil Wheaton in an adventure game any time soon. It's funny, and at times, poignant.\n\nSadly, the second half doesn't follow nearly as strongly. The puzzles are more obtuse. The writing is more matter-of-fact, and a lot of the situations, artwork, and even puzzles get heavily re-used. In some cases this allows for a creative twist on things, but in others it stinks of laziness. Personally I think the issue is that the success of the Kickstarter and Act I gave Double Fine some room to maneuver, so they got distracted: they made several new games such as Massive Chalice and remastered some old adventure titles in between the releases of the acts. The second act feels like it's a necessary conclusion to the story, but one that they rushed through creating rather than taking the time and care needed to make it something truely memorable.\n\nMy other complaint is with the achievements. Most of the time I feel that achievements are neutral - you would've done the requirement for it anyway - or positive because they force you to play the game in a new or interesting or challenging way. But here the achievements are almost all neutral or negative - actively detracting from the experience. First, they were only included for Act I after Act II was released, which forces another run through just to get credit for things already completed. Furthermore, some of the achievements require you to get something right on the first try. For me, this is the worst kind of achievement because it discourages experimentation and encourages relying on guides. It's exacerbated by the fact that there is no chapter select, despite the natural break point in the middle and the forums shouting for some kind of way to jump into Act II when it came out.\n\nFinally, there is a speed run achievement. Simply put: it has no place here. An adventure game is the not the kind of game where you want to skip all the cutscenes and dialogue and use a guide for all the puzzles. That's like purposefully ignoring all the best parts. It's stupid. Some people have theorized it's only there because Xbox Live requires games to have leaderboards. It's just speculation, but if it's true it's awful reasoning and it's fustrating that they kept it included in the desktop version, where there are no leaderboards. And to top it off, because of the included manual save feature the speed run is not even challenging, since you can just save when you only complete a section in the optimal time. So it's an achievement that is a worthless chore requiring no skill that forces you to skip past the best parts of the game. I can't imagine what they were thinking.\n\nBroken Age has some beautiful moments and engrossing puzzles set in a unique world. It can't carry the magic all the way through, but it doesn't have to for it to be a game worth playing.","July 17, 2015","true","18.7"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I've enjoyed several other classic point-and-clicks: Monkey Island I and II, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, Day of the Tentacle, and Full Throttle, and I think this one makes a fresh and interesting contribution to that library.  The art and music direction is fantastic, the voice acting is great, and the humor is done well.  Minor things bothered me in the final puzzle sequence (mostly the music), but overall I liked the game a great deal.  The puzzles in Act I are fairly easy, so most of my enjoyment came from watching the story unfold and interacting with the characters.  In Act II the difficulty increases a bit, which I appreciated.  Online walkthroughs are easy to find, but of course I recommend playing without them as much as possible if you actually want to enjoy hitting those "Aha!" moments when you solve particularly challenging puzzles.\n\n\nThe "Double Fine Adventure" documentary series online is also fun to watch if you're interested in the blood, sweat, tears, and laughter that goes into video game production.\n\n9/10","August 6, 2015","true","15.6"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

Its strengths are story, superb art and animation, top-notch voice acting, and lush original music. The puzzles are more of a mixed bag: some really great ones, but also a few that don't make much sense and may prove frustrating with a lot of going back and forth.\n\nBut, if you like point-and-click adventures, you are sure to enjoy this one. I recommend it. The tone is family-friendly (with a few sly jokes) and endearing. It may remind you in this respect of Machinarium and Botanicula, though voice acting and plenty of dialog really beef up the production.\n\nSo, what's up with all these bizarrely negative reviews? This game had a lot of hype, and was poorly managed along the way (it was originally released in two "acts" and took a total of three years to make), which led to some inflated expectations about and misdirected anger towards the final product. Some people seemed to expect this to be the greatest point-and-click adventure of all time, and when it didn't turn out that way, slammed the game.\n\nJut ignore all that noise: it's not the best point-and-click adventure of all time, but definitely worth your time and money. The game absolutely deserves a "thumbs up," even if it has frustrating moments.\n\nI also suspect that some of the negative reviews come from people who just don't appreciate the genre: point-and-click adventuring has always been based on 1) thinking logically, and when that fails 2) trying to use every object on every other object, and finally 3) going: d'oh, why didn't I think of that! If you don't enjoy this kind of gameplay, this is not the game that will convert you. It adheres to all the conventions of the genre, just with exceptionally high production values.\n\nFinally, I'd like to thank the developers for supporting Linux!","November 14, 2015","true","20.5"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I found the item hunting a bit tiring at times.

I'm glad that there isn't much hand holding, but when certain areas open up, it can be a bit annoying to walk back and forth between screens looking for an item I missed.\n\nStill, it's not like I did not enjoy the gameplay at all.

No puzzle is really difficult, you don't really have to do anything too advanced, and I don't think you even have more than 6 items in your inventory at a time.\n\nThe locations also match this lacking gameplay. Very few locations that therefore limits the game to less characters and less depth. The locations also bother me, because although it fits the style, the art is very plain and the backgrounds are way less detailed than that of other modern point and clicks, such as the remake of Monkey Island or The Whispered World.\n\nI know I shouldn't be whining when the game has a 2nd part in the works, but judging by how most of the $3.3+ million budget was put into this first part and how Tim Schaefer wanted to get some Early Access money to fund the second part, I can only predict that the second part will be just as disappointing.\n\nDouble Fine is capable of much better things than this. Maybe they should stick to publishers and make sure that someone that isn't a complete fanboy believes that they have a good idea.","January 18, 2014","false","3.7"," 58 of 118 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","58","118","0","3"

If you grew up on Monkey Island, you'll find much to love here.  If, however, this is your first foray into the genre, I can think of no better introduction.  Control is simple without invoking a dozen or more arcane verbs, puzzles are mostly intuitive, and hand-holding is minimal unless you go out of your way to prolong certain stages of the game.\n\nPlus, it has the best Quaker Oats Guy I've ever seen, viewable in my screenshot gallery.","June 24, 2014","true","19.5"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

The game is really funny with the quirky humour you've come to expect from Tim, with a lovely art style that remains consistantly cozy and amazing to look at throughout, no matter the route. Both protags are great for their own merits, and add a lot throughout the two wildly different experiences.\n\nOnly thing I can say is the length might not be up to par for some people, although at the time of this review take in to account that only one of the acts has been released, so the second part could be wildly longer in length. I took my time throughout, talking to everyone and clicking on different combos to hear what everyone had to say, and I finished Act 1 in 4 hours, which seems to be the general consensus on how long it'll take a typical person to finish it, so keep that in mind.","June 28, 2014","true","4.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

It seems every title I've touched with him behind the director's chair reminds me why I love video games.\n\nApparently 16 years since his last point-and-click adventure game, Grim Fandango, and the man still knows how to work it. I mean it's not like he wasn't doing anything, with Psychonauts and Brutal Legends druid-plowing themselves into my favorite's list, but point-and-clicks are very different from your normal genre. Practically visual novels; if the story or context doesn't hook you, there's nothing to go back for it aside from meager puzzles.\n\nLuckly Broken Age hooks you from the start with both, and beautiful artwork to boot. Shay and Vella's story is nothing new, something we've seen or read plently times before, but Tim Schafer's spin leaves it refreshing. For example, Shay's situation is entirely understandable, where he puts a mental barrier between him and the "Computer" who is taking care of him. Although never brought up by Shay or the game itself, it's likely only programmed to take care of him - it isn't true love and concern. Yet all it takes is some lovely voice-work provided by the ever awesome Jennifer Hale and a small story toward Shay, and I can't help but feel sad for "Computer". Damn you, Shay, just call her "Mom" for once.\n\nContrary to what I'm saying above, the game is light-hearted. Vella's story about sacrificing maidens is not as grim as you'd imagine it to be. No blood or gore, just a small glimpse of a body as it's devoured by a giant species of monster called a Mog. Yet that's part of its charm. Combined with its watercolor artwork and peaceful soundtrack, it's as if I'm reading a children's storybook. Then you eventually come across someone whose name is shortened to Ch't.... heh-heh.\n\nAll and all, I am very looking forward to Act 2. Having started Shay's story first, I thought I had an idea of where his story ended when I was nearing the end of Vella's. The end of Act 1 practically told me "Nope," punched me in the face, and jumped off a cliff. I'd pay again in order for it to come sooner, but like everyone else, I'll have to wait for the free update... whenever that is.\n\nC'mon, Tim. Don't do this to me, man. I needs it.

The game is a story and puzzle game.

There are many achievements to be had, giving some limited replayability. Some achievements you only get one shot at and if you didn't have a manual save, you would need to start the game over. Most puzzles are well designed, but a few are near impossible to figure out without a guide.  The visuals are amazing works of art. The voice acting and environmental audio is top notch.

It seemed to bring something quaint and unique to the table.. Turns out, that guess was right.\n\nThe sceneries being 2D hand-painted is an art in itself. Honestly, I found myself just staring at how beautiful the game was quite a few times, I mean, even the menu was quaint, as much of a redundant thing that may be to mention. Topped with a lovely and perfectly fitting soundtrack from Peter McConnel (Who also put together the soundtracks for; Brütal Legend and Grim Fandango). it's all the little things that just make the entirety of it so appealing.\n\nThe story-line giving you two different lives with different things to do on each side is already a concept I quite enjoy, it doesn't overwhelm you with too much to do or a need to switch between the two, it just melds in a whole, brilliantly.\n\nThe only thing that may throw it off for some is the movement system and no kind of hints for some puzzles can make for a bit of back and forthing looking for required pieces. That aside making a point and click so enjoyable is quite the achievement.\n\nI'm glad they have gotten far more than their goal funding so there will be a chapter 2 soon released as I cannot wait to play the next adventure. Although I have seen a lot of complaints that it is far too short and too expensive for 3-4 hours of play time just in chapter 1, it is an early access game, you buy it to be part of the process of it growing and bettering itself through good and bad. It's always a given in early access. Now they have more than enough funding for a chapter 2 and most likely quite a few more chapters, I personally think it will end up being quite worth it even though for me it already is, just for the amount of work and detail poured into it, I mean, just the surroundings being hand-painted seems to be such a rare and beautiful thing to see.\n\nFinal summation, lovely game, awesome story-line, characters, voice-acting and all around charming game. Will be worth it to see it develop into a full game.\n\n\n****REVIEW UPDATE!****\n\nAs chapter two has finally come out, I feel this is due for an update.\n\nNow mind you, I still love this game, I however feel that the execution for most of the puzzles in this chapter were even more obtuse and just downright annoying. Now, I'll be dropping a few tiny spoilers to anyone who hasn't played this yet, just a forewarning.\n\nThe fact that the game has gone through hoops just to make these incredibly and punishingly difficult really bothered me. I mean, one example is where you need to figure out how to rewire Shay's robot.. After at least an hour of raging, going back and forth, trying every combination I could think of, I still turned out empty handed. It was only when I went and looked up a walkthrough to see what I was doing wrong, that I felt like putting my head through a wall even more. The answer to the rewire was in a picture that was found in Vella's side. This is using information you never would have known been on the other characters side and something I think barely anyone would ever pick up.\n\nBeing able to switch to find out information is an okay way to do things, but the characters would have no way to actually find this out from an in-game perspective.\n\nThat aside, the entire chapter was put together really nicely with a range of different mini events happening within the game as you unlock and solve puzzles.\n\nAll in all, it's still a more than worthwhile play. Offering a total of about 10 hours of play, give or take however much you rage. Word of advice, have a game guide handy for when you get stuck and close to rage quitting, you may already have all the pieces of what you need to continue.","September 30, 2014","true","16.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

I disliked the fact that you have to drag items from the inventory, I prefer clicking the item and then the target. I really liked forwarding of animation and text passages. For some reason initial configuration has you press spacebar for forwarding. I recommend changing that to the middle mouse button and I'd much rather have this as a secondary function for left-click or right-click since both don't serve any purpose in those cases where forwarding can be employed.\nI also like that you can pause cut-scenes and that dialogue options can be chosen by pressing number keys.\n\nInitially the game showed me a black screen when starting the game with the menu music playing. This was finally resolved by updating my Catalyst Control Center. By then I had already followed some other advice to turn off the Steam overlay for the game and I had to restart Steam to get that back into the game(s).\nThe game has already defined achievements but they are not yet activated. From the global stats you can see that no one has any achievements and that they cover some actions in Act 1 and mostly actions outside it.\n\nThe game includes some strange reasoning, one instance I found funny but the rest was irritating.\n* There is the morbid notion of a lumberjack boarding up his place in order to keep out trees.\n* The lumberjack also boarded up his fireplace which has a fire burning inside at the time.\n* The player character shows some false sense of modesty when refusing to help a stranger in need of assistance because that would include touching.\n* At some point you have to get fruit from a tree and find a way up the tree.. from where the PC simply jumps down again.\n\nThere are a number of nice details in the game. I particularly like the two Star Trek TNG references and the "Extend-A-Ladder". The latter reminded me of the Grim Fandango scythe and triggered a warm bout of nostalgia.\n\nI'm looking forward to playing Act 2 of Broken Age and recommend the first one.","April 14, 2015","true","40.2"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I've never come across a game more directly attempting to reach gamers and improve them as human beings.

I could go on about the instances of this, but there's an outstanding article that pretty much blows it out of the water here: http://www.geekquality.com/broken-age/\n\n2. The art. Ho boy the art in this game. It has the unique Tim Schafer magic of Day of the Tentacle and Full Throttle, but with an elegance that is totally unparralleled in any game I've played to date.

Everything I already said about Act 1 stays true in Act 2. Act 2 is about another 8 hours if you take the time to talk to everyone and try to do every combo of item with person/thing you can. The puzzles are a little more difficult which is good, but at the end of the game figuring out exactly what to do can be a little annoying what with the multiple possibilities of the "wire puzzle".\n\nThe answers to what is going on are basically answered, but not to the depth I (and I'm sure many others) would have preferred, especially given the implications of what it meant. If you're worried about a cliffhanger, there isn't one; it just feels like there could (and hopefully will) be more to the story when you beat it. Sequel perhaps? There easily could be one.\n\nOverall I did enjoy this Act 2 and I feel it was very well done. One of the more memorable point n' click adventure games in a long time.\n\nPosted Jan 29, 2014\nAs of this writing only Act 1 is available but boy did I have a good time! Act 1 is only about 4 hours if you take your time, but what is there is so superb you're not likely to mind. The story is so well put together with truly excellent dialog voiced by professionals. If you didn't already know, this is a point and click adventure game with 2 main characters that have their own unique and separate, but ultimately converging, story. One story is of Shay, a lonely boy who is on a spaceship with only his AI "mother" and "father" for company, while all he gets to do is play boring child-like games. The other story is Vella who is in a pre-industrial civilization and must prepare for the Maiden's Feast. I can't say more without spoilers.\n\nYou may notice a lot of people complaining about the puzzles. What they are actually saying is that the puzzles in this game are all logical and usually have a clear goal given to you. Because of this the puzzles aren't convoluted and illogical like in so many adventure games prior. My only complaint is that the puzzles here aren't complicated at all, but this is only the first act and I expect they will get more challenging in Act 2.\n\nI can't say much about the characters you will meet or places you will go without spoilers, so I'll just say that the people you meet and interact with are all imaginative and well done, no complaints. Although this game doesn't have an examine feature (or taste, touch, etc.) I do like all the different reactions from people as you use items on them. Some are fairly funny with a few adult-oriented jokes thrown in.\n\nI saved the best for last: the ending. Oh man was this cliffhanger of an ending amazing! I seriously can't say more without possibly ruining it and that would be a travesty. For me at least the ending had me continuing to think about and examine the game hours after I had beaten it and even as I was trying to go to sleep. In the context of the game it is so thought provoking, bringing with it many more questions than it answers. I can say I haven't been looking forward to the conclusion in a game with this much anticipation and desire in a long time.\n\nSo is this game worth 25 bucks? Right now it only has Act 1 that is 4 incredible hours, with Act 2 to come in the future for all current and future owners. If you want the most bang for your buck right now then you should probably wait for a sale or Act 2 to arrive. If you know you want this game but are thinking you'd rather wait until it's all done, don't! Part of the impact and effectiveness of the Act 1 ending is the fact you can't immediately proceed in the story to see the conclusion. Instead you are forced to think and mull it over, analyzing what it means and could mean. Conclusion: buy this game now or soon if you can and know you want it, otherwise be sure to get it later.","January 29, 2014","true","20.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

It seemed to bring something quaint and unique to the table.. Turns out, that guess was right.\n\nThe sceneries being 2D hand-painted is an art in itself. Honestly, I found myself just staring at how beautiful the game was quite a few times, I mean, even the menu was quaint, as much of a redundant thing that may be to mention. Topped with a lovely and perfectly fitting soundtrack from Peter McConnel (Who also put together the soundtracks for; Brütal Legend and Grim Fandango). it's all the little things that just make the entirety of it so appealing.\n\nThe story-line giving you two different lives with different things to do on each side is already a concept I quite enjoy, it doesn't overwhelm you with too much to do or a need to switch between the two, it just melds in a whole, brilliantly.\n\nThe only thing that may throw it off for some is the movement system and no kind of hints for some puzzles can make for a bit of back and forthing looking for required pieces. That aside making a point and click so enjoyable is quite the achievement.\n\nI'm glad they have gotten far more than their goal funding so there will be a chapter 2 soon released as I cannot wait to play the next adventure. Although I have seen a lot of complaints that it is far too short and too expensive for 3-4 hours of play time just in chapter 1, it is an early access game, you buy it to be part of the process of it growing and bettering itself through good and bad. It's always a given in early access. Now they have more than enough funding for a chapter 2 and most likely quite a few more chapters, I personally think it will end up being quite worth it even though for me it already is, just for the amount of work and detail poured into it, I mean, just the surroundings being hand-painted seems to be such a rare and beautiful thing to see.\n\nFinal summation, lovely game, awesome story-line, characters, voice-acting and all around charming game. Will be worth it to see it develop into a full game.\n\n\n****REVIEW UPDATE!****\n\nAs chapter two has finally come out, I feel this is due for an update.\n\nNow mind you, I still love this game, I however feel that the execution for most of the puzzles in this chapter were even more obtuse and just downright annoying. Now, I'll be dropping a few tiny spoilers to anyone who hasn't played this yet, just a forewarning.\n\nThe fact that the game has gone through hoops just to make these incredibly and punishingly difficult really bothered me. I mean, one example is where you need to figure out how to rewire Shay's robot.. After at least an hour of raging, going back and forth, trying every combination I could think of, I still turned out empty handed. It was only when I went and looked up a walkthrough to see what I was doing wrong, that I felt like putting my head through a wall even more. The answer to the rewire was in a picture that was found in Vella's side. This is using information you never would have known been on the other characters side and something I think barely anyone would ever pick up.\n\nBeing able to switch to find out information is an okay way to do things, but the characters would have no way to actually find this out from an in-game perspective.\n\nThat aside, the entire chapter was put together really nicely with a range of different mini events happening within the game as you unlock and solve puzzles.\n\nAll in all, it's still a more than worthwhile play. Offering a total of about 10 hours of play, give or take however much you rage. Word of advice, have a game guide handy for when you get stuck and close to rage quitting, you may already have all the pieces of what you need to continue.","September 30, 2014","true","16.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

I intentionally kept myself in the dark to not create expectations and not to spoil myself fun of discovering the game on my own.\n\nWow this game looks good. The art style is gorgeous, music is great. It is obvious that a lot of work went into presentation. Animation for each conversation seems to be hand-crafted, so if you have an eye for details you will find many things to enjoy.\n\nSadly the other parts of the game aren't that interesting. Puzzles are occasionally fun but nothing groundbreaking. In the later stages of the game, when it attempts to provide more challenging puzzles BA falls into a trap of being quite abstract. You will do some things, which really don't make sense within the context of the story.\n\nStory itself is enjoyable but disjointed and not particularly convincing. Still it was good enough to keep me interested for the duration of the game. There are some intriguing ideas but overall it is a very silly tale.\n\nI think it is good game but not a brilliant one. If you are looking for something on the level of the Longest Journey, Siberia or Grim Fandango... well, play those. Broken Age is a weaker kind of p&c - the puzzles stop you from progressing the story, rather than being a way of developing plot and characters.\n\nI don't think Broken Age will reopen doors to point&click adventures. It runs into too many problems the old games did and beside presentation it doesn't bring anything new. But if you crave for a new point&click, it is a fun adventure!","May 1, 2015","true","11.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

So I'll make this brief.\n\nYes, I recommend it. Buy the game.\n\nStrong point: story. Very clever and surprising.\n\nBroken Age ditched all those verbs from the first adventure games. I think that's actually an advance, these things always felt hacky, sometimes there were redundant verbs and you never knew exactly what to do, do I USE a door or OPEN it? Eventually the verbs shrunk to less actions, like full throttle's intuitive wheel. But it was still questionable, what does HAND means I'll do? punch? pick it up? OK, I am glad we got over that but the fact is that more options than simply clicking gives more dimensions to the puzzles and Broken Age feels easy and linear in the puzzle department. Maybe there's a sweet spot between plain click and verbs that makes sense.\n\nI may be swimming against the stream here but I don't like the voice acting. It's not bad acting though, I think they don't know how to deliver Tim Shafer's very dry humor writing, everything sounds like a children's cartoon and it's not as funny as it could be.\n\nUPDATE FOR EPISODE 2:\n\nEverything I said before still holds but I want to make an extra comment on the voice acting. I HATE VELLA'S VOICE. Most of the voices are pretty bad, missing the jokes and all, but serviceable, except hers goes the extra mile and makes me hate the parts of the game I have to play as her. It's like they wrote all of Vella's lines in a book and had someone read it to children as bedtime story, recorded it, and called it voice acting. It's bad. Really, really bad.\n\nI still like the story. It got a little messy and confusing near the end though (still better than several classic adventure games). There were some clever puzzles. I laughed on occasion. Besides my dislike for the voice acting (and hatred for Vella's voice in particular) it's a good adventure game.","February 7, 2014","true","8.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The game when I played it had glitchy animations, graphics and overall felt rushed and unfinished. I can't even remember the music, or the voices. The level of polish and attention to detail I expected from the creator(s) of Grim Fandango just wasn't there. I can still recall Manny Calavera's voice, Glottis, the festival theme, the little jingles, and the rest of the strong characters in that game. That game made an impact on me which lasts to this day. Somewhere along the line, something got lost.\n\nRegarding the gameplay, the puzzles were a bit on the easy side, but at least they were a bit more straight forward and logical than some of the puzzles in Grim Fandango (The Petrified forest driving sequence almost broke the experience for me in comparison). Still, I was not pleased when I saw that this was it. I expected more.\n\nSo for the price you are seeing, I will not recommend this game, and since it is only half the game still, I don't think I will ever recommend the game based on the fact that I was promised a full game and the developers backed off from that.","January 4, 2015","false","2.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Contrary to what you hear, it IS actually possible to set a budget for a game and stick to it... even a creative, art-driven game like this one.\n\nPart of me kept thinking while playing, what game were they planning on making if they had only gotten the $400k or whatever they originally set out to get?  And, is this game WORTH $3 million?\n\nBut as I played and got caught up in the story, I started asking different questions.   Is the game worth the $25 I pledged?  Is the world a happier place with this game in it, even unfinished?\n\nI think the answer to both those questions is Yes.  It's a little bit simpler/easier than I remember the classic P&C adventures being.  But in every other way it's as good or suprerior.  The writing and voice acting are great.  The art is beautiful.  And the story is interesting.  I won't give anything away.. but I really liked the "ending" to this Act.\n\nNow I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that Double Fine can keep it together and manage their budget enough to actually finish the whole game.","January 28, 2014","true","4.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

This game is awesome, it's Tim Schafer and crew doing what they do best, making old school adventure games. Awesome graphics, clever puzzles, awesome settings and characters... I'm really glad I jumped on this when the Kickstarter showed up. AWESOME ending to Act 1. I can't wait for Act 2 now.\n\nIt was pretty easy and clocked in under 4 hours, neither of which I mind, but I know other people have had complaints on those areas. If Act 2 is a little longer that's still an 8 or 9 hour adventure.\n\nBring me more games like this!

Hardcore gamers look elsewhere.\n+ IT'S SO PRETTY. I made so many screenshots!\n+ Keeps you guessing as to the way the two stories are connected. I was wrong! Twice!\n+ Good voice acting. No, really. I know its rare for indie games, but this isn't really indie, now is it?\n\n+/- They don't tell you it's part one of a series until the end of the game. It's not even on the store page; false advertising much? If you're expecting a closed ending, you won't get one. (On the other hand: if you know that it's part of a series, the ending is fine. I really liked it. It ties everything up quite nicely.)\n+/- Logical connections, so it's not very difficult. I'm not ashamed to use walkthroughs and I only had to use one twice, once in both storylines, but with a little bit more clicking around I should've been fine without. I'm fine with a lower difficulty level, but hardcore gamers might disagree.\n\n- It's WAY too short for the €23 (+ Kickstarter funding!) they want you to pay for it.

Contrary to what you hear, it IS actually possible to set a budget for a game and stick to it... even a creative, art-driven game like this one.\n\nPart of me kept thinking while playing, what game were they planning on making if they had only gotten the $400k or whatever they originally set out to get?  And, is this game WORTH $3 million?\n\nBut as I played and got caught up in the story, I started asking different questions.   Is the game worth the $25 I pledged?  Is the world a happier place with this game in it, even unfinished?\n\nI think the answer to both those questions is Yes.  It's a little bit simpler/easier than I remember the classic P&C adventures being.  But in every other way it's as good or suprerior.  The writing and voice acting are great.  The art is beautiful.  And the story is interesting.  I won't give anything away.. but I really liked the "ending" to this Act.\n\nNow I'm just keeping my fingers crossed that Double Fine can keep it together and manage their budget enough to actually finish the whole game.","January 28, 2014","true","4.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

You have the option to play between two story lines, one of a boy named Shay and the other of a girl named Vella, both living in two very different worlds. Vella lives a life where young girls are sacraficed to a monster in order to keep their villages safe and Shay lives a life of solitude trapped in a space station he's grown up in all his life. I've played Act One so far and I can't wait to play Act Two when it comes out. For sure a recommended game. If you're still unsure of whether or not to buy it, I did a let's play on the game.
