The graphics and animations leave a bit to be desired, and the UI is clean but fairly bland.  In spite of these issues, the gameplay itself reminds me of a combination of a use-skill-to-improve RPG (think something like Ultima Online in a microcosm) and The Settlers, where you build up a town with a supply chain (e.g., logs must be cut into boards to be made into some final product at another facility).  It’s an interesting hybrid-genre game, and its major strength is its insistence on making the player’s character a small cog in a larger, dynamically functioning economy driven by the AI.  It isn’t my strongest recommendation ever, but given its unique focus, I endorse it.","April 28","true","3.1"," 33 of 37 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","33","37","0","0"

Love everything about it from the understated graphics to the neat AI thats going on everywhere.\n\nEvery character in the game is doing there own thing, including the monsters. If your a fan of games with unusual and interesting AI this is for you. You can even set your main character to AI mode if you wish and watch it living its own life.\n\nTons of content and well worth the price. There are a few rough edges but Aurora Dusk is still in early access so that is understandable. Highly recommended and looking forward to future versions.","April 29","true","33.7"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

The major issue is not with a technical problem or a gameplay issue, but with the free version offered by the developer. The two versions are different in regard to content (the Steam Age along with all the items, buildings, materials, equipment and enemies along with it) are exclusively to the paid version. It is not much of a difference and the real conflict is with whether it is worth the price to pick up the paid version. I will go ahead and say get the free version to determine if you like this game; I am not leaving it at that though.\n\nThe main objective of the game is to survive the increasingly difficult assaults of Dusk monstrosities. You create a character and journey to Aurora in the hopes of saving it from the Dusk while building your skills by participating in the activity each skill represents. Mine to increase miner, leatherwork to increase tanner, get hit to increase shields and build to increase builder. By increasing your skill levels you also increase your main level and perform tasks faster. There is a mana system for spells and spawning resource nodes, energy for completing tasks, and hunger that affects energy restoration. While you are accompanied by AI companions, you can also hire mercenaries to fight under your control. This makes combat a little easier since the enemy tends to split apart to strike multiple enemies, which is a plus given how some games just send enemies toward the player in a mindless rage.\n\nThe game bolsters three game modes: story missions, wave survival and team deathmatch. During each story mission (which moonlight as the game's tutorial), you are given time to build and equip along side your companions until the waves of Dusk monsters strike. Wave survival is the same, but you are able to customize the number of waves, number of enemies per wave, difficulty of the wave and frequency of each wave. Team deathmatch is similar to a RTS style team fight with up to eight players. Depending on the difficulty setting, you could get through the story missions in three to four hours.\n\nWhat could make or break this game for someone is the focus on a passive community. You can either focus on assisting the AI controlled companions or focus mainly on yourself while they go about their own business. The contributions you make during each mission feels minuscule and it usually falls back to self-improvement to ensure you are as battle ready as possible. You can place defensive structures and buildings hoping your companions will build it, but a lot of times they decide to focus on their own agendas. It is quite possible to complete each mission by handing over your character to the AI as well. This kind of defeats the purpose though and turns the game into a visual simulation.\n\nThe Dusk is not the only trouble affecting Aurora; crashes and select audio issues were present. These issues were present in the demo version and the current build of the paid version. Each mode is at risk of being hit by a random crash while I only noticed the audio cut outs happening in the campaign. Crashes occurred about a third of the time in the team deathmatch game mode making often saving a requirement.\n\nThis game was rather difficult to properly judge. I have not seen a case were a developer was willing to release a demo version this similar to the paid version. The passive community brought an interesting twist to the table, but in doing so isolates the player in terms of personal growth. This could be why it was implemented; not knowing what the end goals of the AI can lead to an underwhelming force to combat the Dusk though. I will recommend this game, but I cannot stress enough how important it is to try the demo version before purchasing this game. It is the rare case you have a clear view of what to expect in a early access title.\n\nPro\n\n- Robust demo (play it before buying)\n- Distinct art style for sprites and characters\n- Unique AI system\n\nCons\n\n- Crashes\n- Audio errors\n- Passive community can be a deal breaker for some\n\n\nSpecial note: I also noticed several grammar and text issues during the course of the campaign. I did not use it in consideration of this review and honestly have no right to question considering my own faulty grammar.","May 17","true","9.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"
