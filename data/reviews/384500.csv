Currently the game is in early access but it seems to be going in a good direction. I will add a TL;DR at the end.\n\nGameplay\nIn Zombie party there are currently three game modes to try which include Adventure, Survival, and a Dungeon Beta. In Adventure mode you start at a forest stage after choosing your character and kill everything plus one boss to advance to the next zone and so on. In Survival you select a zone and you fight in it as more and more enemies spawn and you have to try and survive (you do not advance to other zones). In the Dungeon Beta you fight through a dungeon and try to find the exit of the floor you are currently on as you go through chests and fight the enemies in your way. The fun of getting a super weapon in either of these game modes is amazing, you can get a turret launcher, rainbow gun, coin launcher, flamethrower etc. Definitely a good game to play if your bored or just willing to tear through enemies and then die to one stupid zombie... Anyway the overall gameplay is highly enjoyable and good to pass the time.\n\nFeatures\nZombie Party has some fun features to behold such as:\n- 16 characters to play\n- Tons of guns\n- Relics and upgrades which can be applied to your 5 base weapons\n- Magical runes to crush your enemies with\n- A upgrade system for individual characters and skill points\n- A shop during games where you can change your 5 basic guns and buy health, relics, and runes\n- Controller Support\n- Multiple zones and super weapons\n- Hats\n- Destructible environments\n- Different enemies and interesting bosses\n- RPG system\n- Local co-op\n\nAnd more to come\n\nGraphics/Sound\nThe graphics and sounds are very retro like and I'd say that's part of this games charm. The music matches very well with the style and helps set you right into the game. My personal favorite enemy to behold is the pyramid boss.\n\nPros/Cons\nPros\n\n+ Addictive\n+ Fun with both keyboard and controller\n+ Many features\n+ Music\n+ Easy to get into and good replay value\n+ RPG type system\n\nCons\n**Note that since this game is currently in early access that most of these issues will be fixed when the game is done**\n\n- Controller buttons showing when using keyboard\n- Bit slow at moments\n- No explanation at beginning regarding what your doing, the different guns, the system, relics, and the enemies\n\nSuggestions\nThese are my personal suggestions to the game that I feel will change the game for the better. (If already listed in planned features it will not be shown here)\n\n- An encyclopedia for enemies, guns, relics, and runes.\n- Themed Characters\n\nFinal Thoughts\nI really enjoyed this game and cannot wait for online multiplayer to be a feature. This game is very well done so far and  I look forward to playing it's final copy. This game just appealed to me with almost everything  and I'm happy to have reviewed it.\n\nTL;DR\nZombie Party is a 2D pixelated bullet hell game where you fight skeletons, zombies, demons, etc. You get to choose from 16 characters to play Adventure, Survival, or the Dungeon Beta. There are 5 basic weapons plus a lot more. You also use magic alongside your armory to fight off the huge waves of enemies and fight off bosses. I'd say this game is very fast-paced and easy to get into. The game is very well done so far and If you like the trailer of the game or games similar to it I would suggest checking Zombie Party out as it was highly enjoyable in my time playing it. Just in case you can check the features list to see if anything has been added since the time of this review.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","November 27, 2015","true","6.4"," 32 of 32 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","32","32","3","2"

Lots of replay value.\n\nZombie Party over all was a nice bullet chaos with RPG elements and chaos as a middle name. And you can you will be able to share it with your friends! There are more weapons and extra abilities than you can wrap your head around. There are 4 game modes (Adventure, Dungeon, Arcade & Deathmatch) so its your choice what you feel like. Set your pace with Dungeon mode or if you want a chaos filled flying bullet nightmare check out the other three modes. Plenty of entertainment if this is your flavor of game.\n\nMy opinions here are spent on Dungeon and Adventure mode as Arcade felt impossible alone. Out of maybe 10 tries my best was 2,000 of the 10,000 kills needed to advance. When I tried Deathmatch it was a blast but it was so busy I didn't even know which person was me most of the time ːDː\n\nLike:  Weapon selection is insane and you also get Mods. You start with a basic Pistol, SMG, shotgun, Assault Rifle, and a Launcher. When you use the shop in Dungeon & Adventure mode you will find there are several upgrade options to choose from. Your only limit is purchase cost. Then you can put up to 3 weapon mods on all the weapons and 1 artifact on all put the Pistol. I suspect cause its endless ammo. But a pistol with +dmg, ricochet and spread was absolutely insane in Dungeon. Another beautiful thing is that you can swap them at any time among all your weapons.\n\nQuick Slots & extra abilities are given as melee weapons, ranged magic runes, potions or even explosives. You can hold up to three at a time and easily switch between them by pressing Q. These items can be obtained in chests or from killing monsters but they add so much more to the game. It feels like an endless possibility of various effects and stats.\n\nSelling things is important. I can't express the joy that emptying my inventory of unwanted goods is as simple as right click unwanted item, anywhere, anytime.\n\nDestruction! You can destroy everything on the map. ːDː I had much satisfaction with grenades, bomb & proximity mines loaded up in my Quick Slots in Dungeon mode. But not enough patience to try and level an entire floor.\nDislike:  While in Dungeon mode...what is this thing that never misses, leaves a giant hole and has happened 4 times on a single floor!? Im not a fan. I can't even tell if its a projectile coming off a mob, the sky, the ground...should be able to see and counter or dodge this.\n\nAlso progress resets in Dungeon & Adventure are a huge put off. I feel like there should be some kind of check point or save to make this more worthwhile. Could even be x gold to continue since it seems its currently only used in this Pet Sanctuary. But starting over at the very beginning is just antagonizing to me. And while still fun to get some shoot em up action...replaying the same beginning 20+ times does become kind of blah.\n\nCurrency feels like it could use a boost. In general feels slow and a little frustrating. I feel like the best bet to currency is selling drops. Since the drops are completely random (might get some, might not) frustration comes into play cause you need to buy HP but haven't gotten drops to do so.\n\nI think this game would be oodles of fun with friends. Unfortunately multiplayer is very displeasing at this time. The MP was introduced in March from the news announcements, but has a beta disclaimer next to it in game, so a work in progress.\n\nAs of May 18th my experiences have been being booted with 'Couldn't connect to server, Try again' after already being in the game. Either walking in place, or skipping across the map. Also being told that im picking up items that I still see on the ground. Loaded one game and the grass texture did not appear to finish loading. And in the join delay I died 5 before I even knew what was going on.\nHere's a screenshot of the death screen seconds after I joined.\nhttp://i.imgur.com/D8E4hGR.jpg\n\nDate: May 19, 2016\nRating: 9/10 only because the multiplayer still has some hiccups and I feel like this would be much more fun with friends than alone.\n\nKey provided by Peach Pie Productions but does not influence my review.","May 19","true","12.0"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

I opened it without knowing the fun i was about to have and with only one question in my mind: "why party?"\nWell, you're in a retro world running away from zombie-like-mushrooms and sometimes you're shooting rainbows at them because you're trying to survive. I don't know about you but that's what i call a party.\n\nMy thoughts about this game:Don’t be like me and think that it’s a 2d version of a “walking dead” kind of thing, yes there are many creatures trying to kill you, but you won’t be bored with old-fashioned zombies saying "Braaainns" and running against you. It was pretty fun for me to shoot things without even knowing what they were (they were so weird but funny), they just keep coming at you and they drop coins and weapons to help you on the way.\n\nIt's a basic game, but like many things in life it's awesome because of it. The controls are very easy to learn, there are many weapons to choose from and you feel like a kid again when you were playing with your "game boy" when times were simpler. I know that a “retro game” it’s nothing new but i am happy that i tried this one. I don’t usually like the menu or the music but this time was different, you don’t need to change the sound volume to keep on playing (you can concentrate for real).\n\nI don’t think that i mentioned other important things: blood and explosions made of pixels! A large arsenal of weapons to play in different game modes and a nice retro highscore page! Personally, i would add some trading cards to this game because i really want to have a badge (maybe foil) of this game in my Steam profile. I know that this is an early access review and “Zombie Party” is still unfinished but it’s amazing how much fun you can have with a game like that when there are so many completed games without this type of quality.\n\nConclusion:Sometimes i want to give a game to my friends and i don't know if they will like it. "Zombie Party" will be the answer from now on in a future Steam Sale. 10/10","January 10","true","1.6"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","92","12","13","5","1"

There are tons of unlockable characters and weapons that can be upgraded. You can also adopt pets to help you in combat. There's also multiple game modes, from the classic defeat horde after horde of zombies to a rogue-like dungeon crawling experience.\n\nThe game play is solid, both in single player and in local-coop. With items and magic that you can use, weapon mods and upgrades, skill points to assign, expect a small learning curve. I strongly suggest doing the "How to play" tutorial to get a better feel of what the game has to offer. There's a variety of enemies and environment for each stage, and an unique boss that goes along with it, so the experience doesn't get stale. Although, it can still get a bit repetitive over time.\n\nNet play, on the other hand, isn't quite ready for prime time. It's laggy and choppy so it makes it hard to enjoy the game online. If you're buying the game for online play, then I suggest you wait until it's closer to the final release. There's no actual story line to the game, although I'm not sure how much this would be needed. The graphics have a nice retro feel but it sometimes make it hard to see what's going on when there's a lot happening on screen.\n\nAll in all, it's a very enjoyable game for short bursts of shooting mayhem. The fact that you can unlock and permanently upgrade a ton of characters, weapons, and pets should keep you coming back for more.\n\nRating:\n8.6/10\n\nPros:\nA plethora of unlockables and upgrades.\nMultiple game modes.\nA variety of enemies.\nSolid single player or local co-op game play.\nWell done retro graphics.\nCons:  It's hard to see what you're doing when there's too much happening on screen.\nNo story line.

You can tell that they put a lot of effort into the mechanics, with the RPG and Dungeon modes. Both are unique and have lots of variety to keep the game interesting.\n\nThere are a lot of bosses and extensive challenges that makes this game have a ton of replayability. It progressively gets harder in the waves you encounter in the RPG mode. The Dungeon mode is neat in that it gives you more of a dungeon crawl, so it's a little slower than the standard action or rpg modes.\n\nOverall you can really get a lot out of this game with the amount on content already included. With the total carnage and an unending wave of enemies to destroy, you really get a lot of content and neverending arcade action. The game definitely has a lot going for it and I hope that it gets fine-tuned some more down the road. My only gripes is that a lot of the color from the background and foreground seem to get melded together as the action gets crazy, causing you to lose vision of the prospective horde of zombies and particles to avoid. Also the multiplayer still needs more work.\n\nIf you love insane action games with some rogue-lite and rpg-lite style gameplay, then this game is for you!\n\nRating:\n7.3/10\n\nPros:\nA crazy amount of guns at your disposable, with tons of upgrades to make a huge variety of options.\nLots of options means lots of replayability, Also tons of great fun to be had with others in multiplayer.\nGood old arcade value gameplay, with lots of updates to give the game even more content in the future.\nThe developers are constantly working on the game, so it gets lots of updates.\nGamepad works great so far, with very tight controls. It also already has leaderboards,\nCons:  Some of the colors and weapon effects seem to get blended together with the amount of monsters with their own attacks and effects, causing a lack of distinct targets that can be seen.\nThe menu options need some refinement, they are a little hard to read. The text blends too much with the background.\nMultiplayer mode still needs work, it can lag for some reason.\nNeeds to get a story for RPG mode to make things interesting, maybe some humorous style or combination. :)\nEarly access, so it has some bugs, but that is how things are in that stage of development. It is still pretty well done so far, even if its not complete yet.\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Peach Pie Productions","May 29","true","5.0"," 9 of 9 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","9","9","0","0"

Nevertheless, my opinion about this game is not influenced in any way. Keep in mind that this is an early access review.\nFirst of all, don't get fooled by those numbers in "hours played". I've played Zombie Party for about 10 hours at the time of writing this but unfortunately there is some weird blackscreen bug on Windows 10 and you cannot launch the game via Steam (if you have similar problem, just set the compatibility mode to Windows 8 and launch the .exe file). Therefore, Steam did not count my hours. Anyways, let's start with the review.\n\nOh boy, I did not expect this. Even though I'm a fan of the genre, I thought that it's gonna be just another boring RPG with rogue-like elements. Thankfully, I was wrong. Horribly wrong. First thing you're going to notice in this game is that you have many options to choose from, whether we're talking about characters, weapons, gamemodes or even hats. Yes, you read that right! Zombie Party has hats! I know you already want to buy this game but stick with me for a little bit longer. Honestly, my mind was blown from all those options. Not gonna lie, I came across a new type of weapon even after 7 hours of playing. So yeah, you don't really have to worry about lack of weapons. Neither you have to worry about characters. And neither you have to worry about paying real money unlocking them. That's right, no microtransactions, even though you (as well as me) might have expected them. You also get to customize your weapons a bit, so no playing session is the same. Talking about changing their stats more than changing the visuals (even though you can change visual side of bullets through artifacts that drop from treasures/crates). Moving on to the gamemodes... I have tried to play all the available gamemodes but only two of them took me - Adventure and Dungeon mode. I'd say these are also the main and obviously the best gamemodes. However, there were some problems in Dungeon mode for me. Massive FPS drops in some of the floors, don't really know why. Other than that, the game runs smoothly. It's missing online CO-OP, few settings here and there (for example resolution settings but devs are working on it already IIRC) but overall I had fun times playing it.\n\nPros + a lot of content for an Early Access game\n+ no microtransactions (I can't believe I'm writing this here but you know how money hungry can devs be these days)\n+ every playing session is different\n+ customizable content\n+ the best possible mix of genres\n\nCons - no Windows 10 support (black screen issue)\n- no online CO-OP\n- few settings (no resolution settings)\n- FPS drops\n- mediocre soundtrack\n\nFor more recommendations and reviews on our favourite up and coming quality games follow Lot's O Giveaway's group curations here!","January 10","true","0.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Oodles of unlockable characters, stats, and hats (!!!) to sink your gold and time into, both in-game and between sessions, lead to an immensely satisfying experience from an otherwise simple genre of twin-stick shooter!\n\nAt the time of me writing this, this game is in very much alpha--lots of polish is needed, but it has great potential and is immediately playable to an enjoyable, long-lasting extent.

My review, however, is not affected by this action and will rate this game accordingly.\nREVIEW\n\nZombie Party is a rogue-like game with a nice touch of RPG elements. This game honestly caught me by surprise. I thought I’ll be trying it for a couple of rounds, close the game and then write a review. But no, instead I tried all kinds of modes and try to get a higher score on the leader boards. The game is easy and it’s addicting. Every death just makes you want to do a better job on the next one.\n\nEven though it was stated from start that this game is still in early access alpha stage, I honestly feel that this game is close to being a complete game.\n\nPROS\nCharacter Selection – No single character is the same as the previous one, each has their own different stats and starting weapons. There are few characters that are recognizable to most like Agent 48, Jason, Daft Punk, Robin Hood, and more.\nWeapon Variation – With over 150 weapons to choose from, ranging from a generic firearms like handgun to unique weapons shooting rainbows. This game will surely satisfy you.\nWeapon Modifications – You can add up to three different runes to your weapons such as piercing, additional damage, spread shots and many more. Not only runes, but you can also add artefacts that could burn your enemies on hit or poison them.\nEnemies/Bosses/Maps – Each map has its own set of enemies and a final boss. With this, it won’t be easily become repetitive as most rogue-like game does.\nCONS\nCheckpoints – There are none. Whether you’re in a Dungeon or Adventure mode, once you die, you’ll have to restart again. I know this is a rogue-like game, but maybe atleast give us an option for that? It’s already bad enough that you have to start at the same map, with the same enemies each time you start.\nFrame Rate Drops – For a game with this kind of graphics, even with the number of projectiles coming at you, I didn’t expect to experience some fps drops.","May 29","true","4.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

There is enough customization to make the character your own. The amount of guns to collect and buy will never leave you bored or using the same tactics of taking down hordes of monsters and zombies in the same fashion. Figuring out a strategy with each weapon will help you farm as much gold as you possibly can and help you survive to get to your next map. I love the art style in this game, and the effects. I was not a big fan of the giant particles flying off of some of the weapons like the rainbow gun or the mine thrower, it really blocked a huge part of my screen and I could not see where I was, nor where the monsters were. The UI, shop, ability, and skill menu took me a while to figure out how to even access it, and even then i did not really know what to do. I eventually had to just start experimenting and moving things around and click everywhere to find out what goes where and what does what. The various amount of species of creatures leaves you wondering which one is the strongest, and they all have their own separate abilities. Each map you go to has its own unique species. Gathering spells and coin helped me to survive. I couldn't be greedy with the gold due to the fact that, health is not cheap. Gaining skill points always gave me a motive to keep going as long as I can without being hit. Even though there is really nothing to "rage" about when I died, because when you die it calculates what all you have  done and rewards you with loot (Great Replay ability)! This loot gave me the ability to buy other characters and allowed me to give them a hat to add a bit of my own personality in the mix of all this chaos! Each class has their own style of fighting, so you choose the character that best fits you. This is by far one of my favorite birds eye view shooter games, and since it is a local co-op game, I can't wait to play this while my friends are over! I would recommend this game to every single one of my friends and I really hope there could possibly be an online multiplayer mode soon!","January 9","true","0.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There are several game modes available, tons of weapons and upgrades, plenty of different enemies (NOT just zombies), procedurally generated destructible environments, single-player and multi-player (both online and local).\n\nGame modes:\nAdventure\n\n“A time traveling RPG adventure”. You face 5 waves of enemies with increasing difficulty and a boss fight after that. There is a quick break after each wave when you can buy/sell items, weapons & upgrade your character. Once the boss is dead you teleport to a new world. This mode is equally fun in single-player as well as co-op.\n\nDungeon\n\n“A dungeon-crawling rogue-like experience”. Pretty similar to “Adventure”: 5 dungeon levels end with a boss fight. The main difference is that you don’t have to kill all the enemies, you just need to find an entrance to the next level. Although killing everyone and collecting all the loot helps you progress faster and you will definitely need it as it only gets harder the lower you go. Some of the dungeons are quite tight with plenty of narrow passages which makes fighting more challenging. For the same reason I prefer to play this mode solo.\n\nArcade\n\n“Try to kill 10,000 zombies in 5 minutes Go for the high score.” Pretty self-explanatory. Try to survive for 5 minutes against a looot of enemies.\n\nDeathmatch\n\n3-minute mayhem, 2 to 4 players. This is actually much more fun than it sounds. You start in a relatively small room but massive explosions alter the size and the shape of the room making it bigger. You fight for survival and weapon drops. Player with most kills wins. This is a perfect party mode. You definitely want to play this with friends (you can play with bots as well).\n\n\nPros:\nNice pixel graphics and great chiptune music (seriously, music is good).\nHundreds of different weapons, mods and upgrades.\nA lot of different enemies (not just zombies) and unique looking environments.\nRPG elements (leveling, stats). You level up during a playthrough but also earn coins to improve your character’s stats permanently.\nAddicting gameplay with a lot of replay value.\nPets that you can find or buy. They will fight and level up alongside you.\nOnline and local co-op / deathmatch to play with friends and a full controller support.\nCons?\nI am surprised to say there aren’t many. I haven’t encountered any major issues so I am just nitpicking here to be honest:\nMy only major complaint is that the game only run at 30 FPS and with so much action and movement going on it could really use 60. Vsync helps eliminate screen tearing.\nDepending on the background, text can be impossible to read. Fonts are bulky and awkward looking in general. Inventory window is tiny.\nI would really love if this game had Steam achievements. According to the developer they are coming in one of the future updates so it’s not a big deal.\nBottom line: This feels like a solid complete game, not an early access title. It is fun to play. I have not noticed any major glitches. There is more than enough content as it is to keep you entertained and there are more updates on the way.\nIf you are remotely interested in this type of games, don’t skip Zombie Party. Well-deserved thumbs up.\n\nGameplay video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMBWWdhpfgg\nPC Specs\nHardware Type   CPU Intel Core i7 5820K 3.30GHz   GPU Nvidia GTX 970   RAM 16GB DDR3   OS Windows 10 PRO\nDisclaimer:\nA copy of the game was provided for reviewing purposes.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDeluxeTux/recommended/384500/","TheDeluxeTux","TheDeluxeTux","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheDeluxeTux/","305 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI've never been much for Zombie games, and I'm also no good at parties.  But, with a responsive dev willing to try new things and listen to concerns, Zombie Party is an early access game worth watching.\n\nWith this game, you can expect a colorful top-down arena-based shooter with charming pixel graphics.  There are several game modes, but you will primarily be fighting off hordes of enemies that arrive in waves with a boss fight here and there.\n\nThe thing I like most about Zombie Party is the weapon system.  At any given time, your character will be armed with a pistol, a shotgun, an SMG, an assault rifle, and a launcher.  Each of these weapons can be extensively customized with many combinations of attribute-altering artifacts, meaning that the same weapon, depending on how you build it, could produce rapid-firing spreadshot lasers that ricochet from enemy to enemy, or large piercing incendiary spears that ignite whole clusters of enemies at once, or any number of other things.  When you’ve earned some cash, you can buy improved versions of your older weapons, adding even more customization.\n\nOccasionally, a vanquished enemy will drop a supergun, a powerful weapon that disappears when the limited clip is empty.  These are not necessary to use, and are in some cases not as strong as the combinations you’ve Frankensteined together, but can be really fun; you’ll get things like the Flamewaller, the Teddy Launcher, and the Spiderbot Cannon, which all produce unique effects.\n\nThere’s also a neat magic system; enemies drop spells that have randomized type, damage, range, elemental attribute, and cooldown that can be swapped around and serve as a secondary attack.\n\nI’ve spent about 10 hours with this game.  It’s still early access at my time of writing this, and so far, I’ve found a few issues.\n\nOne; it’s a bit too easy.  Enemies spawn in little groups around the arena but quickly end up clustering in the center.  By strafing and jumping in a wide circle, you’ll basically never die.  Additionally, by putting your best customizations on your character’s pistol or pistol-equivalent (the only weapon with unlimited ammo), you can mop up creatures indefinitely without ever swapping your weapons around.  At this point, I never feel threatened in the adventure mode, and as there’s currently no way to save progress on your run, I end up quitting.\n\nTwo; it’s a bit grindy.  There’s a ton of unlockables that all require lots of coin; and you can also spend coin to permanently increase the stats of your favorite characters.  It would take a lot of playing to max everything.  I never have incentive to buy weapon upgrades (which are temporary), because I need that money for the permanent stuff.\n\nDespite the issues, this game is fun to dip into.  I recommend it in its current state, and feel it may improve as the work continues.\n","February 13","true","11.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

There are currently 4 unique game modes (Adventure, Dungeon, Arcade, Deathmatch) to test your skill along with online leaderboards. Even though the game is in an alpha state at the moment, I can definitely recommend this game to fans of the twin-stick shooter genre, especially those that want to take part in the developing process with continued feedback. In the following review, I will only be commenting on its first impressions and the current state of the game.\n\n==== First Impressions ====----05/20/2016----\nAdventure Mode\nWhen you first choose a character, you will have a few customizable options to choose such as specific weapons for each gun type. After starting, waves of enemies will spawn with breaks in between to give yourself time to level up your stats, change items, or purchase items from the shop. Although most enemies are consituents of a mindless horde, some are tanky while others will utilize special abilities/weapons. Beating a boss will progress the story to the next area. It's important to note that you can also pickup single-use items or magics that you can repeatedly use as long as you have sufficient mana.\n\nDungeon Mode\nThis mode is a dungeon-crawler with a boss at the end of each dungeon. Unlike Adventure mode, this mode allows you to play at a much slower pace. The dungeons are procedurally generated and present drastically different biomes. For both all modes, ammo and gold are randomly awarded upon killing enemies, or picked up throughout the area. Although I preferred playing this mode the most, I really would have liked to see complex puzzles or mechanics.\n\nArcade Mode\nIf you want to play a score-attack/survival mode that sends 10,000 enemies your way for you to defeat in 5 minutes, then here you go.\n\nDeathmatch Mode\nJust like it sounds, Deathmatch mode allows you to play against friends via local coop or AI bots in a small arena with unlimited ammo. The objective is to get the most kills.\n\n==== Current State of the Game ====The developers have shown continued interest in the game, as seen by their posts in the Discussions board along with monthly updates. I haven't ran into any game-breaking bugs as of yet, and the game seems to contain most of its desired core contents. The biggest takeaway points are listed below:\n\nPros:4 unique game modes\nDiverse dungeons/environments/enemies/bosses\nProcedural generation\nAddicting & fun\nMini-map & location highlighter\nCons:Gold gain is too slow in the beginning\nSome particle effects are too large\nParticles sometimes blend into the environment too much\nWeak graphics\n==== Early Access ====For those that are not aware of the Early Access concept, it is perfectly acceptable for bugs to be present and game mechanics to be missing (especially at the alpha stage of development). With that in mind, I can at least say that I have enjoyed what I've played so far, and hope to see more people get a jump on Zombie Party.\n\n==== Hardware Information ====HardwareTypeControllerDS3CPUi5-4590GPURadeon R9 290XRAM8 GBOSWindows 7\n==== Disclaimer ====A copy of this game was provided by the developer: Peach Pie Productions; however, this did not bias my review in any form.","May 20","true","1.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Should this review become depreciated over time, i'll re-write it.\n\n\nZombie Party is a somewhat basic Co-Op Top-Down shooter, with it's sort of "twist" as it were, being an extremely large selection of guns, alongside a huge deal of customization for said guns. I'll get a bit more in depth on that later.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, it's... somewhat basic. While the gun selection is nice, there's nothing in terms of the basic gameplay to set it apart from most other top down shooters. The level variety is nice though, and they have interesting interactions with your character (IE; The Moon level lets you jump higher, but you move slower to compensate). Also, you can jump. That may not sound like a big deal, but that's not an insanely common thing to see in most top down shooters, and it can prevent you from being boxed into a corner, which is fairly nice.\n\nThe overall FX design on the game is fairly retro. The graphics have a sort of SNES vibe going on with them, and the sound design, at least in the soundtrack, is fairly similar in that regard. Curiously, the gun sounds aren't retro, but the sounds of them hitting things IS, which leads to an odd sort of disonnance in that regard.\n\nThe main draw of the game is DEFINATELY the guns. You've got several basic guns; your Pistol, your SMG, Assault Rifle, Grenade Launcher and Shotgun. However, each of those can be upgraded into several different forms, for example; the Pistol can be turned into a Bow for higher damage and accuracy at the cost of firerate, or into Dual Pistols for a damage penalty but a much better firerate and the ability to spray a wall of bullets. Your standard guns aren't your only guns however; you can find "superguns" occasionally, which have much more interesting effects. For example, there's a Rainbow Launcher that behaves somewhat similarly to the grenade launcher, except it launches three bombs instead of one... which explode into three smaller bombs, which all explode in different colors. You can also add mods to your guns, which drop randomly during gameplay. Do you want your SMG to shoot bigger bullets that split in two after a certain distance or hitting something? You can do that. Do you want to lower the range on your shotgun but increase the accuracy so you've basically made a ridiculously high damage short range weapon? You can do that too.\n\nOverall, i see a lot of potential with a game that is already pretty decent. Give it a bit more variation, and it'll definately be great. Even in it's unfinished state, it's still fairly enjoyable. I'd recommend having a friend to play it with though, Solo is a little difficult.\n\n\n","December 21, 2015","true","4.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

It can be nicer if you put the multiplayer mode online, not just on the same pc. The graphics are very nice, the pixelated style is awesome! The sound keeps you alive and you can concentrate when you play :) If you have a plan you can forward in a higher wave so you need to have a strategy to stay away from the zombie crouds that can be very agressive and jump on you when you are not looking. The gameplay is easy, a 5 years boy can play this an make a better score than you do. Colors are nice,. All toghether is a nice game that you can buy for just few euros. In the gameplay you have a lot of weapons so it is very funny to play with them and kill the zombies. I like the pixels that jumps in the game and the coins. it can be nicer if some animals are bring into game and attack the main character. It be nicer if the character can have more lifes and respawn after he dies. The map can be larger, it looks to be small. The world detail are nice, but you can add more objects like rocks and obstacles. The bosses are to hard to bead in my oppinion, they have to much health points. If are more zombie types it will be nicer, and more guns types and super powers. The zombies and characters designs are beautiful. They look nice and pixelated XD. Bosses look scary and are to faster for my skill, they beat the ♥♥♥♥ out of me, as an upgrade, you can add steam trading cards into the game with characters of zombies or something like that. The badge can contain 15-20 cards. I will recomment this game to my friends and I hope they will buy this or play together on my pc. I will try to play this game on my live streaming channel and making this i hope i will help the developers to make more games like this one, right here. If i make this, my viewers can see what i play and they will ask me for this game and they will buy it and play because is funny and have a good price.

The game is early access and is likely to change considerably. But it's so much fun even at this early stage.\n\nFor an early access game Zombie Party has a surprizing amount of content; there are numerous game modes in single player as well as coop multiplayer and Deathmatch pvp. Unfortunately the coop is a little laggy and choppy right now, but the single player and the DM are very enjoyable.\n\nAt first glance the game might seem like a Nuclear Throne type of game, but Zombie Party has much more in common with a hack & slash than even a rogue-lite, never mind rogue-like. That is not a criticism of the game; but for clarity's sake, I do not feel the game plays as a rogue-like. Zombie Party is very liberal with its drops, players get tons of weapon drops from almost any mob, lots of HP drops, and a truck load of ammo. So the game wants the players to just go ham, nonstop. I am all for a bullet flued rampage.\n\nThe game modes available in the game right now are: Dungeon mode, a level based progression through different locations with a boss at the end of each chapter. An arcade mode in which the player needs to kill a minimum number of mobs. A survival mode, where the player goes through different areas in the game facing waves of mobs. And a Deathmatch game with 3 players in a small room trying their best to off one another. Survival, Arcade and Dungeon modes can be played coop; although we need some game fixed before they run smoothly. There are considerable frame drops and freezes in coop. As single player games go survival is my favourite, in Zombie Party that game mode is called Adventure, and the player faces down waves of mobs and attempts to keep them in check. For Dungeon mode, I just didn't feel enough of a reward to my runs, didn't know why I needed to go further. I felt the overwhelming hordes in Adventure and Arcade were more my thing.\n\nThe gameplay is fairly straight forward. The player starts out by picking the character they'd like to run with, they have some different base stats, those stats can be upgraded when leveling in the run. Regardless which character the player runs with, they will start out with a number of "basic" weapons that they can pick ammo up for in the game, the players can then pick up a number of quirky and somewhat insane special weapons that can't be refilled with ammo pickups. I played the game with KB and mouse; the controls are maybe a 7.5/10, aiming gets thrown off by some of the boosts, and the dodge mechanic in this game - the jump, can sometimes be difficult to judge, I sometimes can't tell where I'll land, or if a boss like the centipede is heading for me or missing me where I'm going to fall down. Aside from the weapons which can be cycled through easily there's a special attack with a secondary weapon, which is usually either a magical artifact with spell-like effects (fireballs/projectiles/explosions) or a melee weapon like a baseball bat. I was excited by the bat and lightsaber picks ups - I thought I could deflect projectiles with them, either I can't, or I'm simply bad at gaming. The player can cycle through a three or so secondary weapons, and close to a dozen weapons, so there's plenty of inventory space. Each level there's a shop where the player can spend their cash to permanently change one of the basic weapons into something else, like buy a revolver to replace the starting weapon or a rocket launcher to replace the grenade launcher and so on, the new weapons will use the same ammo. There's a large variety of wares in the shop, I only tested about 10% so far, but I already have a couple of favourites.\n\nAs an added bonus the game contains a menagerie, the players can rescue pets in their dungeon runs or simply buy them with collected gold, and run a little zoo outside all the mayhem.\n\nPros: Lots of Guns\nIntuitive controls\nGreat Game play\nReasonable price tag\nPlenty of content and game modes\nController support (I didn't play much with it, I'm a kb+mouse person, but my PS controller worked fine)Cons: Coop is still very choppy, looking forward to the patches\nJumps are a little hard to read, especially in relation to some bosses\nSome minor glitches with the mobs (clipping into walls for example)\nSome weapon boosts interact oddly with weapons (bullets get too big, or do funny things with the homing effect)\nAll together, the game is well worth it, I highly recommend this game as a fun time killer.\nScore:                            7/10\nSource of consideration: Peach Pie Productions","May 18","true","3.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The pixely graphics are cute, and the music is nice, but what really makes it stand out from similar titles is the level of customization. There are 34 characters available at the moment, though a lot of them need to be unlocked with coins you pick up as you play. The basic characters start with a default set of weapons, and slightly different attributes while some characters you unlock will have different attribute variations and some weapons unique to them. You can also use coins to increase a characters starting attributes, or better starting weapons and you can even buy hats! The game has a pet system which has cute animals follow you around giving you a hand. I have only found one pet, and he helps by picking up loot and bringing it to me.\n\nAs you play you earn experience to level up and each level earns you a new skill point which can be used to boost your attributes(for the current game only) I cant even begin to list the number of items you can loot. There are potions, grenades, magic runes that let you cast spells, even melee weapons like a giant hammer or a chainsaw. There are also artifacts and weapon mods. Artifacts changes the projectile of the weapon they are attached to, and the mods have several different effects, such as upping the weapons damage, making its projectiles larger, faster or even splitting them.\n\nThere are a variety of different enemies, and several bosses with some interesting abilities to make your life difficult >:D\n\nOver all, this is a great game. I recommend getting it, even if you're not usually a fan of this kind of game (I'm not) I have had a LOT of fun with it, and I know I will play this one for many more hours.\n\nRating:\n9.0/10\n\nPros:\nCustomization - There are so many different combinations to make with the weapon mods, its crazy!\nPets & hats - Who doesnt love them?\nSteam Leaderboards - Be the best :P (I only got to 3rd -_-)\nGame modes - Adventure, dungeons, arcade, multiplayer and a sanctuary for all your pets.\nDark Lightsabres - Nothing like dressing as the grim reaper and running around with one of these babies!\nCons:  Crosshair - It is small and white, and fairly easy to lose sight of.\nLatency - The multiplayer is fairly new, and probably the only reason this game is still early access.\nHardware Information\nHardware Type   Monitor LG-27MP37HQ-27 IPS Monitor   Headphones Razer Adaro Wireless   Keyboard Razer Deathstalker   Controller Logitech F310   Mouse Logitech M-U0028   Microphone Microphone   Motherboard MS-7693   CPU AMD FX-6300   GPU AMD Radeon R9 380   RAM 8GB   OS Windows 10   HDD HDD\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Peach Pie Productions","May 19","true","18.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There is 4 modes, Adventure, Dungeon, Arcade, Deathmatch. Adventure is a wave based mode consisting of five levels. You start off, a starter weapon and progress each wave. You gain gold, ammo, weapons and magic items as random enemy drops. After you have completed a wave there is a shop keeper for you to buy ammo, gun, magic items etc. When you beat all the waves there is a end boss each level, then you go on to the next zone. Dungeon mode, haven't played much on it so I am not going to comment on it. Arcade mode you just have to try to kill 10,000 zombies in 5 mins. There is no ammo from what I could see, but super weapons have a timed use. Not really much more to that mode. Deathmatch is where you and a friend fight to the death, for an allotted time. Whoever gets the most kill wins.\n\nZombie party has many features in and out of game. In game you gain levels and can allocate points, into various stats Str, HP, Speed, Etc. Each level more points are needed for each upgrade. There are also special weapons you can find, they are kinda crazy. There is a rainbow gun, gun that shoots like explosive what I believe to be cats, guns that shoot turret guns, much much more. You also gain weapon upgrades and artifacts which you can attach to your base weapons. However you can only have 1 artifact per gun and 3 upgrades. Out of game, you gain gold after playing games. This gold is used to buy weapons you can start off with in game, stats, characters, pets and hats. So if you get enough gold farmed up you can go in with high stats and a good gun. Very fun game, however it kinda feels easy maybe that's just me.\n\nRating:8/10\n\nPros: Variety of guns, and mods\nVariety of enemies\nEasy to pick up and play\nReplay value, with the different modes\nOnline Multiplayer\n\nCons: Frame rate drops\nRetro style graphics and music may not appeal to all\nPretty easy on the hardest mode\nMultiplayer is a bit buggy\n\n","May 19","true","9.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Right now Zombie Party has four game modes (Adventure, Dungeon, Arcade and Deathmatch) and i think everyone can find their favourite mode from there. Basically in every mode there are ALOT of enemies coming to get you and you will be equipped to with armada of guns at your disposal to dispose your enemies with. You can buy new weapons and upgrades from the shop or get them from fallen enemies and there is also three "enchantment" slots (like +dmg, ricochet, poison, etc) and one artifact slot per weapon. You also have Quick Slots in your disposal where you have everything from health potions to magic at your disposal. Also you will gain experience and after leveling you can distribute points to six different abilities. Multiplayer (local and online) also adds much to the carnage.\n\nFor an Early Access game this is pretty close to fully released game and i did not encounter any bugs. Graphics are nice pixel style graphics and you can enjoy the carnage you cause especially with explosives (enviroment too). I would say that game is nice looking and there is also lightning engine coming later on to enrich the graphics. Sounds are also 8bit retro tunes and fit really well for this game.\n\nShould you buy this? / Rating:\n8/10\n\nThose who like these kind of games i would recommend this game highly! Altough this is game with over the top action and might not be fit for everyone but trailer should tell you that already if it is to your liking.

There's so much going on it can be easy to lose track of your character. Under all the mayhem there's actually quite a lot of depth. There's a massive variety in weapons, and the base weapons can be modded to produce a great variety of effects. There are also many abilities available. The mods and abilities drop as you play the game, which makes every game different.\n\nEach time you play you start off by selecting a character, and it's not just a case of choosing the model you like the look of as each character starts off with different stats. These stats can be improved as you play, so you can steer your character the right way according to what items are dropping for you.\n\nThere are a few different game modes, and whilst the gameplay is all the same it does help to have the variety. That mixed with the millions of combinations that come from the items that drop and a whole bunch of characters to choose from really makes every game a fresh experience.\n\nZombie party might look a little simple and underwhelming, but don't let that put you off.

Using a large arsonal of weapons 150+ in the near future, one is required to take on the onslaught of constant enemy waves until the boss arrives. If your in adventure mode you then get to teleport to another random location where you again need to bury the entire landscape in bullet fodder. If your in survival mode you need to just survive the 1 location and in the last mode you need to traverse a dungeon and escape.\n\nIt supports a huge skill tree, gun mods and armor closet etc. Zombie party though it supports local co-op at the moment, still it is a party all by itself even for one person. Multi player is planned in the near horizons.\n\nFun and Chaotic you will know at some point your character is there somewhere in amongst all the flames and explosions and dead bodies, you will know that your character is being labelled a hero amongst the top scores and a street parade should be done in his name, then while your imagining all this glory a single weak zombie out of nowhere bites you and the words 'your dead' brings you back to the real world...\n\nIn final.

It's a top down arcade shooter game with a plenty of character customization and a lot of weapon variations. The game is very easy, but as you progress later on, it becomes more essential to learn how to upgrade your character and weapons to beat mobs and bosses.\n\nGraphics:\nVisually, the Zombie Party is very appealing and very reminiscent of the old rpg games. The characters move fluidly but a bit lacking in animation. The game runs at 30fps, which is great, but playing at 60fps will make the game run more fluidly.\n\nGameplay:\nVery simple premise, shoot zombies, loot weapons, upgrade your weapons/character, then shoot more zombies! But what makes this different from other top down shooter game is its variety and the roguelike element.\n\nMusic and Sound:\nThe music is fun and entertaining, it'll keep you in your toes while killing a ton of zombies. The sound however is a bit annoying. Most of the sound effects are dull and there are sounds that will really hurt your ears.\n\nPros:\n-Amazing Art Style\n-Smooth Animations\n-Nice Overall Music\n-Adventure Mode and Dungeon Crawling Mode\n-Tons of Weapons and Items\n-Local Coop\n\nCons:\n-Most sound effects are dull and other ones hurt my ears.\n-No Tutorial - It's confusing at the first few level.\n-Not Wide Screen\n-Less Epic Bosses\n-No Online Multiplayer or LAN\n-I'm not a fan of the bullet visual effects - It's a little bit distracting\n-Power Up Icons - It's not easily distinguishable what power up it is\n\nOverall, it's super fun to play and will definitely be more enjoyable with a multiplayer besides local coop. I appreciate the game for letting you choose between adventure and dungeon crawling modes, it really adds value to these type of games.

As a result, I can't really factor the price of the game into the review. Also, this is an early access review.\nFirst off, I gotta be honest. This game is not perfect. It's not groundbreaking. A lot of the sound assets are kind of bad. The graphics are in the same boat. As a concept, it's something that's been done and it's artistically bland. In the current state of the game, there are some nasty bugs like getting stuck in the walls and stuff like that.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is really good. People who have played games like Hero Seige will feel right at home here. It's a typical twinstick affair, but that's not a bad thing. There are cartoonish explosions and blood flying all over the place and it's very satisfying. The game runs as well as it plays. It's very smooth. There are a nice variety of gamemodes, characters, and weapons to utilize. The gun variety in particular is quite good.\n\nThis game will appeal to people who like to play games in short bursts as well as people who just can't get enough twinstick shooters.

Adventure mode has you take on waves of enemies before fighting a boss and moving onto the next area. Dungeon mode is less hectic and does away with the waves, instead having you descend random dungeon levels (with destructible walls!) until you get down to the boss. Enemies get tougher as you progress, but you level up along the way and can assign earned skill points to make yourself stronger, tougher, and faster as you see fit. You also collect gold which is spent between waves at the shop on new weapons or ammo and supplies. After you die the game tallies up the gold you collected and adds it to a running total, which you can use to permanently upgrade your character's starting stats or weapons so you'll do better next time.\n\nThe waves of enemies are massive, which makes it all the more satisfying when you tear through them en-masse with a powerful special weapon or a decked out shotgun or grenade launcher. A really nice touch is that each area has its own matching set of enemies (e.g. jellyfish in the underwater area). Further switching things up, the bosses have unique attacks with bullet hell like patterns instead of simply being an oversized enemy.\n\nWhere things get really get interesting is its weapon system. There's tons of disposable special weapons you can find as drops and you'll never know quite what they'll do until you try them. Your mainstays are five basics weapon types (pistol / SMG / shotgun / rifle / grenade launcher), and those each have three mod slots and an artifact slot (except the pistol). As you plow down enemies you'll find mods that range from simple accuracy/damage/fire rate boosts to ones that affect the projectiles themselves, like "homing" which makes them gravitate towards enemies.\n\nIt felt like I was cheating when I first used a spread mod on the grenade launcher to make it 3 grenades per shot, but as enemies got harder and soaked more damage it became important to conserve ammunition by finding mod combinations that made each weapon as effective as possible. The SMG was my least favorite because it didn't do much damage per shot and large hoards seemed to eat its ammo like candy, but when modded with damage boosts it became extremely effective at taking down bosses quickly through sheer DPS.\n\nI happily played multiple rounds of Adventure mode, experimenting with weapon mods without giving magical attacks much of a chance. Yep, magic is a thing too. Also pets. Did I mention there's a surprising amount of depth? But it's not overwhelming, and you don't have to master every mechanic to have fun.\n\nBesides it being hard to keep track of enemy projectiles when using a weapon that floods the screen (large projectile mods especially), my only real complaint is that I couldn't enjoy the soundtrack much at all. Some tracks have a nice chiptune sound (FamiTracker?) but rather jarringly others are straight up MIDI. Musical taste is entirely subjective of course, but little evoked any sort of emotion from me. The main menu gets me pumped, the little jingle when defeating a boss makes me feel accomplished, the pet sanctuary music fittingly makes me picture a peaceful utopia, but in-between most of the tracks just feel like background music.\n\nPros:\nBig hordes of enemies to tear through\nDifferent game modes. Wave-shooter, dungeon crawler, arcade/score, MP deathmatch\nCharacter progression so your deaths aren't in vain\nLots of weapon mods to make your guns unique. Also magic. And pets\nFun boss fights with bullet hell attack patterns\n4 player co-op!\nLots of nice little touches and pointless features that make the game feel polished and give it charm. In the option menu there's a setting to give every enemy a name and display it on screen\nCons:  Can be difficult to differentiate between your projectiles and enemy projectiles\nSoundtrack lacks cohesion (chiptune+MIDI) and is a mixed bag overall","May 30","true","9.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","2","2","0","0"

You will get my honest feelings about the game (both good and bad).---\n\nReview Written on Thursday, May 26th, 2016\n\nReview\nThis review is based on my time playing with update #10. The game is considered to be a Stable Early Access Alpha.\n\nThis is a great game at this point and seems to be getting better by the day. If you look at the user tags on the store page, you will find there are quite a few listed. I find the major tags are Action, Adventure, Twin Stick Shooter and Dungeon Crawler. When you first start the game you are presented with a menu which gives options to start a game, take a tutorial, visit the pet sanctuary, edit options and see your statistics. The 4 options to play once you start a game are adventure. dungeon, arcade and deathmatch. Each different game type gives you a different type of gaming experience depending on what you want. The main idea of the game (at least for me) is to collect coins in game in order to unlock characters and upgrade stats while surviving the mobs of enemies attacking you. There are other things to spend your gold on but these things were what I really wanted to concentrate on. There are a load of things to collect and do while in game such as collecting weapons and weapon mods to make your guns even more powerful. There are runes to collect which give you magic abilities and even pets to unlock which will fight by your side (see more on this in the cons section). The replay factor here is massive as there are a boat load of things to unlock and the gold doesnt exactly come easily.\n\nIn the following section I will try and touch on a few of the things that make this game so great and also a few of the things that could still use a little bit of work. Please keep in mind that the game is still considered an EA Alpha game and there will be things that need work but this game has come quite far from where it started and the developer is constantly releasing updates for bug fixes and new features. I expect that within a few more months it will be ready to come out of Early Access and have all the bugs worked out.\n\nRating:\n8.5/10\n\nPros:\nThe replayability of this game is quite high. There are many things to unlock and with the online multiplayer just recently introduced the sky is the limit with this game!\nWeapon variety is massive here. With over 150 different weapons at this point plus weapon mods, there is practically an unlimited number of ways to destroy your enemies.\nHaving Steam Leader Boards is a great way to keep people coming back to try and smash those highscores.\nThis game was built to be used with a controller. I played a bit with the keyboard and mouse and it was all right but when I got going using the controller, it just seemed so much more smooth and easy to play.\nThe developer is actually listening to the community and adding new features, new game modes and fixing bugs as they appear. With the work put in so far and the list of things to come, I cant see this not being a huge hit and we the players benefit most.\nCons:Not sure if this is an issue for just me or not but I can't seem to get anything to do with pets working. The game crashes when I go into the pet sanctuary at the opening menu. Also if I play the game and a pet drops and I free it from its crate, the game crashes and I lose all my coins saved up to that point. Even though it says this issue has been addressed at this point, It hasn't for me.\nThere is alot to spend coins on but there are not many coins awarded based on how long you play. Maybe increase the coin drop rate a bit but not too much because if you unlock everything too quick then the main reason to keep playing deminishes.\nThis isn't a major con but steam achievements and trading cards would be beneficial. Everyone loves collecting trading cards and not that it is needed but steam achievements would be another reason to keep playing!\nAnother suggestion would be to get 4 packs of this game to sell on steam. The game at its core is much better to play with friends. It is even in the title "Zombie PARTY" What is a party with no friends???\nDisclaimer:\nSource of Consideration: Peach Pie Productions","May 26","true","11.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There are 6 modes of play at the moment including Adventure, Dungeon, Arcade, Deathmatch, Online Beta and pet sanctuary.\n\nThe game is in ALPHA at the moment but it is surprisingly playable for an alpha game. I think this shows how much the potential the game has if it is this good in alpha. The playability is wonderful and the dev really has captured the perfect speed and movement of the character. They are not too slow or too fast and you always feel like you are in control of the character. A really important ingredient in any shooter. You can choose from 5 characters who each possess a different skill set. The skills are Strength, Hit Points, Speed, Magazine size, Fire power and Luck.\n\nI can recommend this game in its current state especially as the developer is actively seeking suggestions and bug reports. A great chance to add a feature you might see as fun. The game is quite difficult but not impossible. There are obviously a few bugs flying around especially in the multi player online side and this needs to be developed. The game at the moment lacks replayability in my mind as even though it is great fun blasting baddies with massive explosions and an impressive arsenal of weapons, each mode feels like the same thing again and I found that once I got killed I couldnt be bothered to start all over again from the start. I have suggested that there should be some mode where you can continue the game and I hope that is implemented.\n\nRating:\n7.0/10\n\nPros:\nGreat Playability - The characters have the perfect speed and manoeuvrability.\nOnline play - Even if it is a bit broken at the moment.\nOnline Leaderboards\nA willing developer who wants to hear your suggestions and fix bugs.\nA great array of weapons and the sight of multiple explosions is impressive to see.\nCons:  Maybe a bit repetitive at the moment\nBugs are present and certain modes are in development but it is still a playable game now and it is in alpha!\nHardware Information\nHardware Type   Monitor LG IPS LED FLATRON IPS234   Headphones Turtle Beach Earforce X12   Keyboard Corsair Raptor K40   Controller Microsoft Xbox 360   Mouse Trust GXT 25   Microphone Turtle Beach Earforce X12   Motherboard ASRock Z97 Extreme 6   CPU QuadCore Intel Core i7-4790K 4400 MHz 44 x 100   GPU Gigabyte GeForce GTX 760   RAM 16GB   OS Windows 81   HDD Crucial M550 512GB SSD\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: PeachpieProductions","May 26","true","4.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Flashing colors, 8 bits of sound and pixels and that youthful feeling when I look at this game.  Zombie Party in every way feels like an old arcade game, replace keyboard with a few buttons and mouse with a joystick and your feeling nostalgic all over again.\n\nZombie Party comes crashing at us with everything you could want in a classic arcade game with different modes from standard arcade mode where your met with several waves then need to defeat a boss to make it to the next level, to survival see how long you can hold out against a nonstop hoard for 5 minutes, to a dungeon run where you go down levels to find new items and new waves of harder and harder baddies.  Add the fact that there are tons of weapons and weapon customizations with a few dozen characters and you have hours of good grinding at your disposal.  Level up get pets and beat your way to the high score.  Want even more fun, well what fun is a party without friends to join in on the action. The multiplayer mode (currently not stable) gives you the same feeling but with your friends making for more intense firefights and fast paced gameplay.\n\nWant even more fun, well what fun is a party without friends to join in on the action.

Where to start, well its a top down shooter and this one is a whole lot of fun, its the most fun i have had with a top down shooter since loaded!. The main menu looks great and its easy to use, The how to play and tutorial is great and explains how everything works. The options menu has everything that is needed, however its in 1 big list with quite a heavy font and in my opinion its an eye sore.\n\nThere is single player and online play, 4 game modes make the game have alot of playability with Adventure, Dungeon, Arcade and Deathmatch. On the online side of things you can host or join someone else game, i expect the online games to be mega fun once the lag is sorted out because its unplayable in its current state and i was frustrated with it within minutes, It was a shame really after having such a wonderful experience with the single player mode and then having the online side so unplayable, i am sure the dev will sort it out soon as the updates are on the way and its still in alpha.\n\nLOTS OF GUNS!!!, there are so many weapons and unlockables and upgrades the game will be fun for hours, i would personally like to see steam achievements on here just as an added bonus.\n\nRating:\n7.5/10\n\nPros:\nweapon,unlockables and upgrade choices are excellent, making every game different\nplenty of game modes to keep you interested.\nControls are very easy to use, i used a steam controller and a keyboard, although both were easy to use i preferred to use the keyboard.\nCustomize certain elements of charecter, hats an stuff :D\nTutorial was excellent and gets you off to a great start if you dont wanna sit a figure things out\nCons:  lag on online play is quite bad.\nThe text in options is to big an a bit heavy on the eyes, need to be made smaller and the option being grouped together, graphics, Audio and controls etc\nSometimes there can be to much going on at one time and it can be hard to see whats going on, this is something i can live with.

It looked OK when I was going through the description to read about it before activation, and the trailer got me a good 3 mins of chuckle. I mean, all of the content and art from the trailer, oh man. It was funny, I mean, A WALKING PYRAMID THAT WAS ALSO THE ILLUMINATI, WHO WOULDN'T LAUGH? But the game itself was a little to the better side of the middle of OK to good. The projectile spam from the bots and enemies was just. It was horrible, no other word for it. I was so distracted that I literally couldn't tell myself from one of the bots, the bots ( and I ) from enemies, etc. Though, the game itself had me rolling around laughing like a pig in mud, its pretty broken and lacking, though, keep in mind it is in its ALPHA stages. For an alpha game though, it had a lot of content, good unlock-able characters, nice adventure mode, 4 functioning game modes, etc. Overall, I give it a nice, 7/10 for the 8.1 build.","January 10","true","0.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(background selection menu with backgrounds unlocked by acheivements?)\n\nbullets\na big issue i had going into this is character speed, some monsters throw bullets around in a bullet hell pattern and some of the bullets were WAY to big. not hard to avoid but when your speed is low it is hard sometimes even with upgrades.\n\nweapons\nthere is a large variety of weapons available in the game but only a few stand out, mostly because the bullets are so limited and the enemies are so high you get to a point where your guns start getting disposable\n\nenemies\nanother issue being the amound of enemies in the game, the variety is nice and most of them are bullet sponges but the bosses are ridiculous. i fought this giant worm thing, used bullet after bullet even upgraded. didn't even put a dent in the thing. some of the bosses definitely need to be nerfed.\n\nartifacts\nmight just be me but i always seem to forget to use my special ability or magic, maybe put an indicator like a flashing icon or something similar to it as its forgettable.\n\nhealth\noverall the game is got a lot going for it except one thing, the health. every run i seem to be dying because the enemies just eat rounds and do damage equal to a mike tyson punch. the enemies damage needs something else as they just are too powerful.\n\nall of this was a list of my complaints in the game but other than that is was a fantastic game and would recommend it for a bit of fun !!","January 24","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The graphics are fun and the music is great. The adventure mode is hard and you will die a lot. There is not much time between waves so it is difficult to switch items, add upgades, switch magics, and visit the store. In the dungeon mode it is a little slower paced and you are able to learn the finer details of the game. There are tons of items and you are able to customize them. You are able to upgrade you characters in the start up screen if you have enough money so that you can start out your next play through with better stats. This game does not have a save mode yet which is unfortunate because I believe that you would be able to so much more if you were able to save your progress. Another unfortunate thing to this game is that is not a tutorial to it so you are kind of left to figure out all the controls on your own which is a bit of a challange. I spend more time that I should just pushing keys in order to find out which ones opened what menus, so it would be nice to have a tutorial with the game.

The upgrades and variety of spells and weaponry make for a unique experience with each attempt at a play through. The controls are tight enough to feel responsive, but the targeting was a bit too easy to lose track of in the heat of battle. With so many bullets and animations bombarding the screen its easy to lose sight of your character and which direction you're facing. That aside it felt like gold wasn't necessarily given to you in bulk, but still felt like you earned it after surviving a massive wave. I am definitely recommending this to my friends and will see if I can test out a local dungeon or adventure run. All in all I'd give this title a solid 8/10. Considering that its still in alpha I have high hopes for how this game will develop. Especially with online play in the works.\n\nKeep it up!

At the time of writing we have:\nAdventure: Defeat waves of enemies, shop for upgrades in between then defeat the challenging and inventive boss and move on to a totally new world with new enemies and attack patterns.\nArcade: Reach 10,000 zombie kills as quickly as possible. No upgrades or stopping to shop, just keep shooting and aim for a high score!\nDungeon: Great mode with a lot of replay value. Travel through larger maps of randomized dungeons with new enemies and scenery. Bosses make appearances too.\nDeathmatch: A barebones deathmatch mode for 2-4 players. Shoot each other in tiny arenas. Probably won't grab your attention for more than a few minutes.\nA.I bots make a great addition to solo or local co-op games. Let them tag along in any of the game modes above and they will collect and upgrade weapons and hardly ever let go of the trigger. They will even revive you if you're downed. Adding bots in is also a good way to see what super weapons the unlockable characers have, without spending gold to unlock them first. Excess gold can also be spend on permanent stat upgrades or hats (woohoo!) for your favourite characters.\n\nThe number of weapon upgrades and visual variety of their projectiles is huge. They can be upgraded to increasingly ridiculous versions, for example the shotgun can become a blunderbuss or a fish launcher (more like giant dolphin launcher). On top of this, artifacts modify the projectile type e,g bullets become lasers and runes (auto-equipped to a max of 3 and interchable) can add elemental effects. Weapons also upgrade in level as you use them. The result is a game screen constantly filled with rapidly-changing bombs, spinning lasers, auto-turrets, exploding teddy bears and so much more.\n\nAt it's core, Zombie Party a simple wave-based twin-stick shooter with enough variety to keep 1-4 players occupied for quite a few hours.\n\nLonger Review\n\nIf you're interested in reading an extended review with screenshots, gameplay footage and a giveaway (ends February 4th 2016), click here[www.bobmanbob.com]\n\n\nThis game was provided to me for review purposes.

Graphics, image, music,v.v... all interesting! In terms of gameplay, it's... somewhat basic. While the gun selection is nice, there's nothing in terms of the basic gameplay to set it apart from most other top down shooters. The level variety is nice though, and they have interesting interactions with your character (IE; The Moon level lets you jump higher, but you move slower to compensate). Also, you can jump. That may not sound like a big deal, but that's not an insanely common thing to see in most top down shooters, and it can prevent you from being boxed into a corner, which is fairly nice.

It looked OK when I was going through the description to read about it before activation, and the trailer got me a good 3 mins of chuckle. I mean, all of the content and art from the trailer, oh man. It was funny, I mean, A WALKING PYRAMID THAT WAS ALSO THE ILLUMINATI, WHO WOULDN'T LAUGH? But the game itself was a little to the better side of the middle of OK to good. The projectile spam from the bots and enemies was just. It was horrible, no other word for it. I was so distracted that I literally couldn't tell myself from one of the bots, the bots ( and I ) from enemies, etc. Though, the game itself had me rolling around laughing like a pig in mud, its pretty broken and lacking, though, keep in mind it is in its ALPHA stages.

There are a number of different gamemodes, but they all have similar concepts - kill the enemies and progress to the next stage. The game has an active developer within the community and updates are frequent. It is colourful and the huge range of weapons and customisation and weapon modding options allow the game to keep your attention for quite a while. The cute graphics are simple but appealing, although in some areas they are a little too simple. But overall, its a fun little game.\n\nThe game is of course still in Early Access, so some aspects of the game are still a little under-developed. For example, the AI is very simple - enemies basically just walk straight towards you. Also, the enemies and bosses dont vary very much from zone to zone, having extremely similar abilities and actions (but of course different appearances). However, I am sure these flaws will be worked on in future updates.\n\nI will now briefly describe the current gamemodes:\n\nAdventure mode puts you against waves of enemies. After 5 waves, you fight the boss of that zone then progress to the next zone. The shop and dropped weapons and artifacts allow a huge amount of customisation. I'm not too sure about what happens at the end of adventure mode (if there is an end) because I'm not amazing at the game and have only managed to get to Zone 3.\n\nDungeon mode allows you to fight your way through the different dungeon floors. I've not played too much of this mode, but there is a large boss fight planned at the end of this dungeon-crawling mode.\n\nIn arcade mode you attempt to kill 10,000 enemies in 5 minutes, which to me seems absolutely impossible. But I'm sure if you're good at the game this could offer a considerable challenge.\n\nAnd finally, deathmatch mode lets you fight either a friend or a bot, 1v1. This allows you to fight enemies with identical abilities and similar strategies to you, making an even match, instead of fighting hordes of mindless zombies.\n\nRating:\n7.5/10\n\nPros:\nThe cute pixel graphics make the game very aesthetically appealing.\nGood controller support.\nA variety of different gamemodes, keeping your interest for longer.\nOnline and local multiplayer support, as well as steam leaderboards.\nFrequent updates and an active developer.\nCons:Very simple AI.\nThe game gets a little repetitive after a while.\nClicking Pet Sanctuary in the main menu when you have not unlocked pets crashes the game.\n\n\nHardware Information\nHardwareTypeMonitorSamsung 4K HDHeadphonesTurtle Beach PX24KeyboardAcer M3400ControllerXbox One Logitech G27MouseLogitech Performance MXMicrophoneBlue YetiMotherboard CPU GPUGeforce GT 740 1GBRAM5GBOSWindows 7 64-bitHDD15TB HDD 450GB Free\nDisclaimer:\nSource of consideration: Peach Pie Productions","May 28","true","3.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Having a combination of random powerful guns and temporary aura buffs at the same time is super satisfying. It's nice that on top of the standard zombies, there is a horde of different monsters. Holy moly there is a lot of guns, and I haven't come close to seeing all of them. When going all out, it's a grand party of colors.\n\nThe controls function smoothly, and one different feature that I really like, is being able to dodge enemies by jumping, even if I keep forgetting to do it.\n\nOut of all the modes, most of my playtime was put into Adventure.\n\nAdventure:  beat several waves and defeat the boss to move on to the next dimension.  Pretty straightforward.  Best strategy for me was to safe the best guns for last. Surviving was hard to begin with, but upgrading with coins made it easier. Personally, I think the potions that get put into your inv seem unnecessary in Adventure, since you usually don't have time to look at them while moving and killing monsters.\n\nArcade:  defeat as many monsters as possible in 5 minutes.  I honestly do pretty poorly in this mode. Constant action, and not much time to stop moving.\n\nDungeon:   clear a floor and continue down. After some time in it, I found it to be a slower pace and much fewer monsters than Adventure. Got down to the third floor before going back to Adventure Mode. Main focus of it felt like was in the exploring, although hopefully more gets added as it didn't keep me interested.\n\nDeathmatch:  Player vs AI or coop.  The AI are pretty good picking up guns and targeting the player. After a few rounds, it wasn't hard to keep beating them. I think Deathmatch would have been my favorite if I had enough time to get my friends to join me.\n\nPros:  Dodge jumping and simple controls.\nUpgrades  for everything, both characters and guns.\nThe different game modes.\nMixed:Game runs smoothly, but currently  30 fps\nPotions (hardly got around to using them)\nThe  Menu text  is a little irritating on the eyes.\nCons:The  music  gets repetitive after a while.\nSpotting loot drops  can be hard when behind the terrain\nFinal Comment and Rating:I'm quite happy with the choice of game modes; my favorites being Adventure + Arcade. I feel like the chaoticness is where the fun is at.   7 / 10\n\nDisclaimer:\nPlayed during Early Access with a review copy.\nSource of consideration: Peach Pie Productions","May 30","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm surprised that this game is still in early access because the game already looks better than 99% of all of the other 'incomplete games' on steam. The game has multiple game modes and a great tutorial to help explain some of the more advanced mechanics of the game. Such mechanics include different weapon types, magic types, and upgrades that can be customized to create different combinations of attacks. The only criticism that I have for this game is that it can be incredibly hard to play through the game in single player, but with friends it can definitely be a fun experience.\n\nRating:\n8.5/10\n\nPros:\nA complete, bug-free game with more additional content coming while it remains in Early Access.\nAllows for plenty of customization with different magics, guns, and upgrades.\nHas local coop, online coop and online multiplayer.\nCons:  Difficulty can be hard when playing alone, but becomes easier with more players.\nHardware Information\nHardware Type   Monitor PhilipsTrueColor3000TV   Headphones GradoSi80   Keyboard MicrosoftBasicKeyboard10A   Controller SteamController   Mouse RazerNaga2014   Microphone cheapbrandNA   Motherboard Motherboard   CPU AMDFX4170Quad-CoreProcessor420GHz   GPU GeForceGTX560SE   RAM 4GBx2CorsairVengence   OS Windows7SP1Ubuntu14   HDD SeagateBarracudaST1000DM0031TB7200RPM","May 30","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This top-down arcade shooter is jam-packed full of gamemodes and weapons in which you fight zombies solo or coop.\n\nZombie Party has many gamemodes Adventure: an RPG styled adventure (which could have more RPG elements), Dungeon: fight zombies and monsters floor by floor, Arcade: killing as many zombies as you can in under 5 minutes for a high score and Deathmatch: shoot your friends or bots.\n\nThis to me is a wide variety of gamemodes still in early access and most of them are fully functional and well thought out. The Adventure though could have more RPG elements to it, as it was my only gamemode criticism. I believe, the characters, which are fully customizeable, should have a bit of lore or backstory from their life previous to this zombie shooter or even their attributes put into specialty, such as a Sarah being a fitness worker or Alexis being a rebellious teenager, something to provide the characters with more of an understanding.\n\nThere was 1 glitch I did manage to find in the game, I somehow managed to get stuck within a tree and I was not able to move, luckily I had the grenade launcher though fixing it would be thorough. Apart from that the game had a brilliant art-style and a range of unique weapons which made the game quite fun and interesting. The music was quite repetitive and annoying after a while.\n\nOverall, this game was amazing, seeing as it's still in Early-Access I didn't spot many glitches and the game was fully functional. I found it quite addicting and will be playing much more of this within the future.\n\nScore: 7/10","January 9","true","1.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

What a great game with lots of potential, but just like all early access games, it still needs some work. This game reminds me of some of the early childhood arcade games I used to play, and I can’t stop playing it simply because of that. Although I do enjoy this game, there are a few things it lacks, but like many people say… Perfect is impossible.\nThe game gives you a wide range of weapons which also comes along with endless upgrading possibilities, not only for your weapons but your character’s stats as well. This leaves for numerous different ways to take on the game. Gold is the currency in the game and is used to buy upgrades for guns and weapons as well as special outfits for your characters. There are also multiple different characters which keeps you interested in the game even if you max out one character’s stats.\nAs for the graphics and the sound effects, I really love the 8-bit feel to the game’s visual and sounds. The graphics give out the feel of a 80s game and the colors blend very well together.\nThe production of the music is excellent but should be more fitting to the scenery. It is very weird walking through a mushroom forest with castle-like music playing in the background. The music could have also had more of an 8-bit feel just to add the nostalgia the developers seem to be going for.\nThe bosses in adventure mode were super fun all the way through, and the fact that they each have their own special abilities will keep you on your toes. I definitely recommend getting a second player on with you, whether it’s a friend or a bot, because the bosses get super challenging very early in the game. Although the bosses were super cool in adventure mode, which encouraged me to play more, wondering what the next boss would be, the whole thing lacked a story line and there was no character lore (such as their background, what they are fighting for, etc.). The procedural idea behind dungeon mode gave it more of an adventure feel than adventure mode itself.\nDeathmatch was super fun for the classic arcade game fans and the people who like to kill zombies and bugs aimlessly with no goal other than surviving. The only thing that Deathmatch is missing is the online multiplayer which I feel like, if integrated, could generate more interest in the game as well as giving it much more potential to be extremely successful.\nAll in all, Zombie Party was pretty fun but still has some ways to go. It is only in its early access stages and I have lots of confidence in the developers of this game. The wide range of weapon and character upgrades as well as the nostalgic feel is what makes this game. If they worked more in adding a story line I feel like this game would improve greatly. Integrating multiplayer would also be a great idea since multiplayer gaming has almost taken over the industry. I look forward to seeing what this game will bring us in the future.  Zombie Party is ranked 7/10 for me, and I recommend you check it out for yourself!\n","January 10","true","3.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A simple hell shooter with pixel graphics.\n\nThe art could be tightened up a bit, and refined, and we could do with more graphical options; especially for resolutions.\nThe same for audio, some sliders or levels would be nice instead of simply on and off.\n\nThe game though? It's okay; nothing amazing sadly. It's not bad, and it's not good, the levels are simple and mechanics as well. It gets the job done. One thing that's really interesting is that it can have 4 player co-op which is really rare, and a nice option.\n\nThere's not much else to say yet, the game is still in development and I hope they improve a lot and tighten it up. Massive variety in levels, enemies, and weapons are what's needed for these types of games and I hope it gets copious amounts of it all.\n\nPC Gameplay\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTM6jHZqw_c","July 31, 2015","true","0.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Yeah, too many.. This game is just fantastic, I could be hours playing whitout getting bored. Why so great? Not only beacuse it's a retro 8 bits, something I really love but here you have several game modes and you can choose normal and hardcore experience.\n\nMy favorite one is the Dungeon Mode, which I can go through several "floors" or levels. Arcade mode it's quite difficult! I like the difficulty but's it's too complicated and too many zombies! I cannot pass the first stage "Dead Forest". And zombies are not the only enemies, you have the whole forest trying to attack you, something I like. Is just not about zombies.\n\nI can have several characters! I'm waiting for having enough gold to buy new ones. That was a fantastic idea.\n\nThe music: lovely. You can hear it for hours and you won't want to delete the game! Also, there are several themes to hear and delight.\n\nSomething I'd add... The "floors" are very simmilar, I mean each has a higher level of difficulty than the previus but fthey seem to be always the same level. Would be great if they change a bit, other enemies, colors, enviroment, etc.\n\nIt's impressive to have the chance of local multiplaying, pityful I don't have anyone who can play with me to test. In case of Arventure mode would be a great idea to put a quantity cap of zombies, and let the game to calculate the number of enemies if I go alone or with someone else. Is not the same to kill hundred of enemies alone than with companions.\n\nDeathmatch is amazing. It's a pity I could't try with friends, that would be a great. But the screen game is too small if I compare with the other game modes.\n\nAnother suggestion, adding a "running" mode, or just going faster would be great! Especially at the dungeon mode or big maps.\n\nOne last thing: the cursor is white and in Deathmatch it's complicated to know where you are aiming too. Maybe try another color?\n\nThanks for making such great game!!","January 11","true","4.9"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

I didn't think I was going to like it even as I was typing the CVV code in for the purchase, but I love supporting indie, and I was at least very curious. I've only spent thirty dollars on it, but already it's made my list of games to bring out when I want to to play with someone in the same room as me.\n\nFirst, the Good: This game is beautifully addictive. The gameplay is simple enough that you'll be decently proficient in very little time, but deep enough to be interesting after a couple of plays. The weapon customization was oddly engaging, once you realize it's there, and substantially adds to the replay value. The game maintains a high tension level throughout the game, so it has a high multiplayer/spectacle value.\n\nThe bad: Honestly, there's not much bad I can say about this game aside from two glaring issues. First, I'm not sure how well shopping and skills work in multiplayer, as well as weapon switching, but I haven't tried it yet, so I don't know. The one I DO know about, though, is the lack of progression. With progression goals (maybe unlocking new special weapons?), the game would give people a reason to keep coming back. It would also add to the game's somewhat lacking content, though I still found it incredibly fun to play.\n\nIn any case, This game (AS IS, EVEN) is worth the eight dollars, and is only going to get better as development continues.","September 27, 2015","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm not a lover of twinstick shooters, but I do like the genre.  However, this one didn't really win me over for a few reasons.\n\nIt's overly-chaotic.  The colors and flashing get old really quick for me and at times it's hard to even tell what the hell is going on in all the chaos.  The sound design lends to this chaos in certain situations, and can become overbearing.  Some people may enjoy the chaos, I found it frustrating.\n\nThe goal is disappointing.  Now, I don't really know how far the main mode goes, but I honestly just got bored and killed myself before getting to the end.  All you do is run in circles and fire on a blob of enemies til it does, occasionally picking up a new gun or powerup to make the job easier.  This leads me to my next point:\n\nThe enemies are just tanky bullet-sponges with no sophistication.  Occasionally an enemy may fire a projectile or something, but as you circle around the level, they just huddle up in the middle of your circle like you're the moon to the planet created by these creatures.  From there you just keep running in circles, firing into the blob until the wave is complete, and repeat.\n\nTo me, it feels like the Dynasty Warriors of shoot-em-ups.  Some people like Dynasty Warriors, and if you do you might really like this game for what it is and that is okay.  I, however, do not enjoy Dynasty Warriors and did not enjoy this game.\n\nNote: key was provided to me for this video.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5-H2MGqGiaI","November 26, 2015","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lots of Game modes this keeps the fun going.\n\nMusic sounds cool, old school style but new at the same time.\nThe Colors are nice and trippy like, I dig it. Graphics are meant to look Old school and it works for the game.\n\nAs for the First mode, I will call the idea not original as I have played multiple games like this, most recently Hordelicious I beleive it was called. However I found this games art, sound, and overall gameplay way better than Hordelicious hands down. The stats are a nice touch when you die too.\n\nThe Second mode Adventure mode is what makes this game stand apart from others that are like it.\nWhilst going to different floors is cool, It makes this more of a tower game I guess, I think it might be more fun if it was more open world like zelda, But this mode is still my favorite and is fun to play too.\n\nI like that your gold is saved and added up to be spent on new Characters, Hats and maybe other things.\n\nThe Deathmatch is cool, needs online play tho, and bigger maps. The gun fx are awesome but they cover up too much of the screen bigger maps would help alieviate some of this I believe as well.\n\nI think the highscores should have an Online leaderboard as well.\n\nKnowing that it is a work in progress I'd give it an 8/10 for what it is Which is still a Great game just needing a couple things to make it complete.\n\nPS Please Also add STEAM CARDS and ACHIEVEMENTS PLEASE!","January 10","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This review is a honest review for my fellow steam friends and i won't in any was alter my descision and swear to give a honest detailed review.(you can check my previous reviews and see that some of them are negative because the games weren't good enough).[/h]\n\nokay so i played for an hour for now. I understand its not much but it was enough for me to fall in love with this game. The graphics are low but that adds a lot to the fun of the game. This game is based on one of my favorite genres killing every moving thing with a huge arsenal of weird weapons. From shooting with a normal gun to shooting rainbows(crazy hilarious). I played twice on each mode(once on any difficulty) and i enjoyed every single one. the normal mode is hard but not crazy hard so its fun to play while watching a show or a movie or something.Playing a hard mode is insane everything jumps on you from all directions trying to kill you.\nThe graphics and sounds are very retro like and I'd say that's part of this games charm. The music matches very well with the style and helps set you right into the game.\nPros and cons:\nPros\n+ very Addictive\n+ great modes\n+ Music\nCons(game is early access features may change)\n- low fps( around 30 cap)\n-no tutorial(only shows keys but not skills/power ups and so on)\nThere are 3 kinds of main modes:\n-adventure: just go around looking for things to kill and kill em the normal fun way to play a game\n-dungeon: for the more exploring people. You move around different level of the dungeon, every few levels there is a boss that tries to literally stomp you.\n-arcade: for the insane people. 10k monsters jump on you and try to kill em while you fend them off. the mission is to kill em all in 5 minutes( only got to 5600 but i hope to get to 10k in a few more tries :P)\nalso there is one more mode called deathmatch. I personally haven't played it but its a game between players so its probably awesome.\nbugs: NONEEEEEE literally not even 1 bug that i noticed. the game is running flawlessly which is not usually seen in early access games( and sometime in none early access also)\noverall:\neven thought this game is early access( i guess cause the multiplayer feature is not out yet) the game works flawlessly and is awesomely fun to play. for pixel lovers and gun/shooter game lovers i really recommend this game.\n","January 9","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In a good way, though. Then I found out it was made using GameMaker: Studio, and I was even more impressed. Zombie Party is a game about killing, well, zombies...and other enemies. The main objective in the game is to kill everything. There isn't really any strategy involved. It's a game to pick up every now and then if you have a few minutes to spare. It feels like it could be played on mobile devices without much difficulty.\n\nThere isn't really a tutorial, but the controls are displayed to you at the beginning of every match. The sounds are great, if not a little overwhelming at times, such as when everyone is firing an advanced weapon at the same time or picking up coins/ammunition/items.  The music gives it a kind of "retro" feel.\n\nThere are four gamemodes in Zombie Party: Adventure, Dungeon, Arcade and Deathmatch. A-D-A-D. A dad. This game is/will be the father of the zombie apocalypse.\n\n*cough*\n\nAdventure doesn't really live up to its name. You try to survive through as many waves of enemies as possible, buying new weapons from the store and collecting others from dead zombies. There isn't really any incentive to actually "explore," and there are so many enemies that walking around too much is pretty difficult.\n\nDungeon is my personal favorite gamemode; it's just like an RPG! Well, minus the quests. You explore each floor and once you've killed enough enemies, you can descend to the next floor. There are chests with items, abilities, spells and stat points that you can use to your advantage, and there are many secrets to discover as well.\n\nArcade is probably the most insane gamemode of the four. You race to beat the clock and kill 10,000 enemies within five minutes! As you can imagine, the gunfire and enemies are crazy. This is when you may notice the game's only real drawback - when the firing rates get too high and there are so many enemies, you can easily lose track of where your crosshair and character are located. Because of this, I would occasionally find myself aimlessly firing in a random direction, not hitting any enemies, and losing health. After a while this can get pretty frustrating. However, I still liked the frenzy.\n\nDeathmatch is my least favorite of the four, perhaps because I don't have any friends. The idea behind this gamemode is to kill each other, or in my case, kill the bots while they try to kill you. You're in a limited area which gives weapons with a wide range of fire an advantage.\n\nOverall, I do recommend this game - but not for the full price. $8 times a tad pricey for something as repetitive as this. Each round is virtually the same. So I would only recommend it at least 40% off.\n\nScore: 7/10","January 9","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you´re playing the game for the first time you can see in the menu 4 different modes. These are adventure,dungeon,arcade and deathmatch. For me adventure is the classic mode which everyone should try first. In dungeon you can kill bosses and discover some secrets. Then there´s arcade where you get zombies and you have to kill them in some time that is given to you (to get highscore). At last deathmatch is mode where you can kill your friend or bots. This game is about killing zombies (you don´t say) and getting golds from them to buy weapons to kill more zombies. Thats sounds logical right? From every zombie you´ll get experience, so there´s a level up system (which is a big + in this game). Once you beat a wave of zombies you can buy weapons or upgrade you hero. This game is local-coop up to 4 players so you can invite your friends to ZOMBIE PARTY! (See what i did there)? What else should i say? There are more than 150 guns, lots of hats to unlock, easter eggs and more cool stuff. This game is in early access. So the game is still in progress. Developers will add more cool stuff like achievments, online multiplayer, more pvp modes, story elements (my favourite).\nSo what are you waiting for?\nGO GET IT!","January 17","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You, as a member of a team of(maximum) four players must complete a time travel quest where you fight against different kind of enemies through different areas and well designed levels. There are also another three gamemodes: Dungeon(where you must complete different floors, clearing them out of enemies and finding the exit to progress through levels), Survival(name says it all, you must survive and kill 10,000 zombies in less than 5 minutes, you have access to all kind of weapons but you are still vulnerable so keep that in mind), and in the end but not less important we have Deathmatch gamemode(name says it all, PvP non stop action, the one that gets most kills in a round of, i think, 5 minutes wins).\n\n\nGraphics and Physics\nGraphics are decent despite it is a 2D top-down shooter. There are so many nice effects added for guns and enemies. Physics are well worked, you dont fall off map or get stuck in any area(atleast it didnt happened to me, but who knows). HUD and User Interface is very well done, you can see where you have to go through menus and your inventory you can clearly see where you have to go to in your inventory, stats management menu, etc.\nGraphics and physics are very well designed, you can hardly find something that breaks the gameplay like errors and things like that.\n\nSounds\nThis may, and may not be its strongest point. It depends on the player... It has a good soundtrack list(for me), it fits perfectly with this retro RPG Top down monsters shooter. But, it can always get better.\nIt should have some kind of hyped music when facing bosses or when going through secret areas(Dungeon Gamemode), that can make the player feel even more interested in knowing whats going to happen next. But anyways, music is good and sounds are good too, but in my personal view i would like it to have some kind of difference between facing normal enemies and facing bosses.\n\nGameplay\nAs i said in General Review section, it has four gamemodes(very well designed). You have alot of different characters to choose, also there are alot of custom items to buy with gold(gold is earned by playing the game and making progress through any of the gamemodes).\nDeveloper did a great work doing a(maximum) four players local coop, game deserves it and it was a mandatory thing to do.(I played it with friends and we loved it).\nOnline multiplayer will also be implemented as developer says, which it will increase the fun alot more(because people that dont have alot of friends or controllers can also feel the cooperative part of the game).\nControls feel very good, quick and fast. There are alot of options regarding camera distance view, thats something great.\n\n\nFinal Review\nI dont find anything that i can hardly punish from this game, i liked every aspect of this one graphics, physics, gameplay, everything fits perfect for this game. But what i should say that it is doing an EXCEPTIONAL work, its the developing team. They are doing a great work, launching new updates almost every month(check changelogs and announcements).\nIm proud to say this is a MUST have game, because it will have a great online community, developers are working hard to make the game better accepting suggestions and because its a very fun top-down shooter!\n\nWhat are you waiting for?

It has unique gameplay and modes, especially dungeon crawler mode. You explore a random dungeon, kill monsters, find secret places, get awesome weapons, level up, and of course SLAY THE BOSS!  It really grabs my attention, since this game supposed to be a bullet hell and little RPG element in it.\n\nIt also has many collectible items inside, and always track your stats so you can see how much damage have you done to the enemies, or maybe how much money you have been collected.\n\nBug? Nope. I haven't found a gamebreaking bug.\nThe only bug I find is about collision between players and wall terrain, sometimes make the players stuck. But who cares!? Just destroy it, problem solved.\n\nOne of the shortfall is the lack of online multiplayer feature. It would be much more fun if this game implement online multiplayer.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/t0b3/recommended/384500/","t0b3","iddqd","http://steamcommunity.com/id/t0b3/","2742 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nZombie Party is a Twin Stick Shooter with pixel graphics and a lot of RPG elements. Now what makes it special? Well I'm glad you asked so let me tell you:\n\nFirst off, I am not too fond of games with pixel graphics as I find them to be flooding the Steam Store. What makes this one different however is the mixture of simple pixel art and great looking sprites, i.e. for weapon projectiles, etc.\n\nAlso, the most important part: This is Early Access done right. You can't feel that the game is in its EA state but rather a pretty muched finished version. I've had no crashes or issues whatsoever. The main reason the devs seem to be doing EA is because they want to listen to feedback and improve their game like the player would love to see it. That's something you rarely encounter these days, so big ups for that.\n\nTo get back to the game itself, the controls are smooth and the movement in the arenas is always fluid. Come to think of it, it's not only arenas. There's also PVP and a dungeon mode with bosses and stuff. And you can keep collected gold after a game session to purchase hats (Yay!) or even better, character models. There's even Mr Skeltal. So if you're looking for good calcium, purchase this game!\n\nNow you might be wondering what I do NOT like about this game? Well let me tell you. Since it's EA I hope the devs will fix these issues at some point:\n\n- There is no true widescreen mode - you have 2 black bars like in an emulated 4:3 mode.\n- The camera does often zoom out way too late if you play with multiple players (Or bots).\n- The FOV is too low. Enemies can easily sneak up on you.\n- Sometimes the effects are a tad too much and you lose track of what's going on on the screen.\n- Weapon upgrades are too expensive if you ask me. You can barely afford 2 within one complete wave.\n- The special powers activated with LT is a little confusing as well at the moment.\n\nOther than that I think this is a great title with great potential!","January 10","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now let me talk about each game mode and what was my reaction for playing it.\n\nDungeon: I was happy for playing this because i really like when i can explore, fight a boss, upgrade my weapons and be powerful, i just played in the first two levels because i died, but it was funny!\n\nAdventure: This mode is the one that gave me the box head feeling,but its not a copy, the feeling was because there are zombie hordes a mini boss that throws beams (like devil in box head) wich makes this game mode perfect for those who like zombie hordes, a lot of weapons, and bosses!\n\nArcade: This was very funny, because you have 5 minutes to kill all the zombies you can, if you can kill 10000 zombies you earn a bonus (but only if you kill 10000 before time runs out!) I really enjoyed playing this because it was a big challenge!\n\nPvP/PvB: This game mode is good if you want to fight with another human or bots! You start in a medium sized room, there are a lot of crates in the floor, and you have to break them in order to get weapons. At first i thought it was not going to be funny, but after playing it for some minutes, i really enjoyed it.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMusic: I liked the music, the music genre is 8-bit, the music is great but after some time it becomes repetitive i give it 7/10\n\nGraphics: I dont care a lot for graphics, i only want them to be agradable for the view. For the type of graphics this game has, i would say that they can improve, but they are good. I  give them 8/10\n\nGameplay: The game has 4 different game modes, wich makes this game give us a lot of time of game play! You can unlock characters, hats and upgrade stats! I give its gameplay 7/10\n\nThis game is good and has a lot of potencial. I really want to see what is the developer going to add :)\n","January 10","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There are alot of options regarding camera distance view, thats something great.\n\n\nFinal Review\nI dont find anything that i can hardly punish from this game, i liked every aspect of this one graphics, physics, gameplay, everything fits perfect for this game. But what i should say that it is doing an EXCEPTIONAL work, its the developing team. They are doing a great work, launching new updates almost every month(check changelogs and announcements).\nIm proud to say this is a MUST have game, because it will have a great online community, developers are working hard to make the game better accepting suggestions and because its a very fun top-down shooter!\n\nWhat are you waiting for?

It has unique gameplay and modes, especially dungeon crawler mode. You explore a random dungeon, kill monsters, find secret places, get awesome weapons, level up, and of course SLAY THE BOSS!  It really grabs my attention, since this game supposed to be a bullet hell and little RPG element in it.\n\nIt also has many collectible items inside, and always track your stats so you can see how much damage have you done to the enemies, or maybe how much money you have been collected.\n\nBug? Nope. I haven't found a gamebreaking bug.\nThe only bug I find is about collision between players and wall terrain, sometimes make the players stuck. But who cares!? Just destroy it, problem solved.\n\nOne of the shortfall is the lack of online multiplayer feature. It would be much more fun if this game implement online multiplayer. Well, let's see what this Early Access game could do for this one :)\n","January 10","true","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now what makes it special? Well I'm glad you asked so let me tell you:\n\nFirst off, I am not too fond of games with pixel graphics as I find them to be flooding the Steam Store. What makes this one different however is the mixture of simple pixel art and great looking sprites, i.e. for weapon projectiles, etc.\n\nAlso, the most important part: This is Early Access done right. You can't feel that the game is in its EA state but rather a pretty muched finished version. I've had no crashes or issues whatsoever. The main reason the devs seem to be doing EA is because they want to listen to feedback and improve their game like the player would love to see it. That's something you rarely encounter these days, so big ups for that.\n\nTo get back to the game itself, the controls are smooth and the movement in the arenas is always fluid. Come to think of it, it's not only arenas. There's also PVP and a dungeon mode with bosses and stuff. And you can keep collected gold after a game session to purchase hats (Yay!) or even better, character models. There's even Mr Skeltal. So if you're looking for good calcium, purchase this game!\n\nNow you might be wondering what I do NOT like about this game? Well let me tell you. Since it's EA I hope the devs will fix these issues at some point:\n\n- There is no true widescreen mode - you have 2 black bars like in an emulated 4:3 mode.\n- The camera does often zoom out way too late if you play with multiple players (Or bots).\n- The FOV is too low. Enemies can easily sneak up on you.\n- Sometimes the effects are a tad too much and you lose track of what's going on on the screen.\n- Weapon upgrades are too expensive if you ask me. You can barely afford 2 within one complete wave.\n- The special powers activated with LT is a little confusing as well at the moment.\n\nOther than that I think this is a great title with great potential!","January 10","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now let me talk about each game mode and what was my reaction for playing it.\n\nDungeon: I was happy for playing this because i really like when i can explore, fight a boss, upgrade my weapons and be powerful, i just played in the first two levels because i died, but it was funny!\n\nAdventure: This mode is the one that gave me the box head feeling,but its not a copy, the feeling was because there are zombie hordes a mini boss that throws beams (like devil in box head) wich makes this game mode perfect for those who like zombie hordes, a lot of weapons, and bosses!\n\nArcade: This was very funny, because you have 5 minutes to kill all the zombies you can, if you can kill 10000 zombies you earn a bonus (but only if you kill 10000 before time runs out!) I really enjoyed playing this because it was a big challenge!\n\nPvP/PvB: This game mode is good if you want to fight with another human or bots! You start in a medium sized room, there are a lot of crates in the floor, and you have to break them in order to get weapons. At first i thought it was not going to be funny, but after playing it for some minutes, i really enjoyed it.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMusic: I liked the music, the music genre is 8-bit, the music is great but after some time it becomes repetitive i give it 7/10\n\nGraphics: I dont care a lot for graphics, i only want them to be agradable for the view. For the type of graphics this game has, i would say that they can improve, but they are good. I  give them 8/10\n\nGameplay: The game has 4 different game modes, wich makes this game give us a lot of time of game play! You can unlock characters, hats and upgrade stats! I give its gameplay 7/10\n\nThis game is good and has a lot of potencial. I really want to see what is the developer going to add :)\n","January 10","true","4.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The menus need a tad bit of work. During gameplay, the dungeon mode, I never felt threatened or that there was any scarcity, i felt overpowered, I only died when a boss spawned on top of me. There was nothing else really to it, it also felt empty exploring the world, Dungeon Mode needs work. During adventure mode I felt like it was almost right it just needs some polishing and more explanations, such as you can equip the runes to your guns and level up. The Music was okay, at its worst it sounded midi. The tracks didnt really suit the action or never really made me feel anything. The music needs improvement. Personally the i didnt enjoy the art style, It felt kinda odd to me. But hey thats me. The guns themselves felt kinda samey. Just some different effects, however the super weapons are really fun. I always looked forward to getting to see a new one. I also had a problem with auto switching weapons after i picked them up and sometime lead to confusion. After awhilei felt that it was more like Killing Floor. I would like to see where this game goes because i feel it has potential to be something really fun. I Will be playing more.

This review is a honest review for my fellow steam friends and i won't in any was alter my descision and swear to give a honest detailed review.(you can check my previous reviews and see that some of them are negative because the games weren't good enough).[/h]\n\nokay so i played for an hour for now. I understand its not much but it was enough for me to fall in love with this game. The graphics are low but that adds a lot to the fun of the game. This game is based on one of my favorite genres killing every moving thing with a huge arsenal of weird weapons. From shooting with a normal gun to shooting rainbows(crazy hilarious). I played twice on each mode(once on any difficulty) and i enjoyed every single one. the normal mode is hard but not crazy hard so its fun to play while watching a show or a movie or something.Playing a hard mode is insane everything jumps on you from all directions trying to kill you.\nThe graphics and sounds are very retro like and I'd say that's part of this games charm. The music matches very well with the style and helps set you right into the game.\nPros and cons:\nPros\n+ very Addictive\n+ great modes\n+ Music\nCons(game is early access features may change)\n- low fps( around 30 cap)\n-no tutorial(only shows keys but not skills/power ups and so on)\nThere are 3 kinds of main modes:\n-adventure: just go around looking for things to kill and kill em the normal fun way to play a game\n-dungeon: for the more exploring people. You move around different level of the dungeon, every few levels there is a boss that tries to literally stomp you.\n-arcade: for the insane people. 10k monsters jump on you and try to kill em while you fend them off. the mission is to kill em all in 5 minutes( only got to 5600 but i hope to get to 10k in a few more tries :P)\nalso there is one more mode called deathmatch. I personally haven't played it but its a game between players so its probably awesome.\nbugs: NONEEEEEE literally not even 1 bug that i noticed. the game is running flawlessly which is not usually seen in early access games( and sometime in none early access also)\noverall:\neven thought this game is early access( i guess cause the multiplayer feature is not out yet) the game works flawlessly and is awesomely fun to play. for pixel lovers and gun/shooter game lovers i really recommend this game.\n","January 9","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When you´re playing the game for the first time you can see in the menu 4 different modes. These are adventure,dungeon,arcade and deathmatch. For me adventure is the classic mode which everyone should try first. In dungeon you can kill bosses and discover some secrets. Then there´s arcade where you get zombies and you have to kill them in some time that is given to you (to get highscore). At last deathmatch is mode where you can kill your friend or bots. This game is about killing zombies (you don´t say) and getting golds from them to buy weapons to kill more zombies. Thats sounds logical right? From every zombie you´ll get experience, so there´s a level up system (which is a big + in this game). Once you beat a wave of zombies you can buy weapons or upgrade you hero. This game is local-coop up to 4 players so you can invite your friends to ZOMBIE PARTY! (See what i did there)? What else should i say? There are more than 150 guns, lots of hats to unlock, easter eggs and more cool stuff. This game is in early access. So the game is still in progress.

The monsters are good and varied adjusted to each level of the dungeon. The sound is good enough but, the music it's boring.

However, this review remains impartial and based entirely on the game itself.[/i]\n\nWhat's the game?Zombie Party is a bullet hell, emphasis on hell (and bullet).. The game has a multiplayer arena that I haven't used since I have no friends, an adventure mode that you can do solo or with a team that I will never have because I have no friends, and a dungeon mode that you can... I'll leave it at that.\n\nWhat features are in it?ANY GAME IN WHICH YOU CAN DECIMATE FUCCBOIS AS MR. SKELTAL WITH A BONE BLASTER IS WORTH PLAYING.\nTo start, you must pick a character. Your saved up coins, once you don't use to buy guns before you die, can be used to buy new characters. Each has different stat boosts.\n\nIn Adventure mode, you go into a huge arena and shoot the bazillions of monsters that slowly trudge towards you.\nYou then get blasted with a billion lasers and die to a boss, no matter how prepared you are for it.\nYou can buy different guns with different base stats with coins that oft drop from monsters.\nAlso dropping are several things like special guns, enchantments, and boosts. You can use 3 buffs and 1 other enchantment on each gun, and they can make devastating combinations based on the firing pattern of the gun itself.\n\nIn Dungeon mode, you run through different floors full of monsters, explosives, traps, and boxes. Boxes and monsters can drop coins and monsters, and you don't get totally overrun like you do in Adventure mode. It's very similar, and quite fun. Sometimes, monsters glitch out of the map and you glitch in between a crystal and a wall and have to restart. Checkpoints would be nice, so would not glitching.\n\nWhy should you buy this game? This game is a bullet hell. That's quite fun.\nIt has a lot of variety.\nIt's a very fast-paced game in 2 dimensions.\nYou can play as Mr. Skeltal.\nThere is a lot of intuition that goes into maximizing damage in specific situations.\nThere are multiple game modes.\nThis is where I'd put my games with friends... IF I HAD ANY!\n\nWhat's the catch?Some of it just feels imba.\nThe bosses are less intuitive and more damage cannons.\nYou can't skip your character barfing up a few hundred coins after you die.\nYou can get stuck and have to restart.\nYou can use fire guns underwater.\nYou can use fire guns in space.\nSome traps have no signs at all, no way to avoid them.\nJumping is a bit slow and unvariable.\nIt's early access - we have no idea where it's gonna go.\nSprites are pretty ugly.\n\nOverallYou should buy it. It's reasonably priced for what it is. It's early access, so there's a lot of room for growth. May get reworks on stuff like sprites.\nThough without a story, it includes all of the good elements of a bullet hell game. Totally worth $8.","January 11","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a two-stick shooter with a mix of casual and RPG-like elements. Sounds boring, but its actually great fun, especially with more players. Enemy waves are pretty intense and the graphic has a really nice retro look. The gameplay, however, is a bit one dimensional, running backwards in a big arc while choosing the most explosive weapon can get a bit tedious.","March 31","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There have been a LOT of changes since then. It started out as a single player, keyboard and mouse only top down shooter. It's progressed into a multiplayer, controller compatible, twin stick shooter that is unusual, and fun at the same time. Here are a few other things that have changed over time.\n\nCharacters.\nYou only had one character way back then. I think we have a little more than a dozen now. Newer characters added in their own unique guns. They also have their own starting stats. You can use your gold to increase all of these, but the luck stat. I expect more characters will be added. You do have to earn them though.\n\nMaps.\nWe now have many different maps. There used to be only one. I don't even remember there being any rocks or trees. Just grass, and maybe a bush here and there. Now we have Deserts, wintery forests, an underwater zone, and even the moon itself. Each has it's own enemies, music, and surprises.\n\nGame modes.\nStarted out with a survival mode only. Now we have Arcade, Adventure, Dungeon, and Deeathmatch.\n\nWeapons.\nUsed to be that you only had one weapon per slot. That, and a few "superguns". Steam used to have that feature in a way, but it all changed when new characters were added with their own unique guns. This kind of imbalanced things because some were extremely powerful, and had no ammo cost. Now we have many different guns of various types. Don't like the pistol you start with? Then switch it out for one of the many others. Not enough boom in your boomstick? Buy a new one. There is a lot of variety in looks and stats, but with the exception of character specific guns they mostly retain the feel of their basic "type".\n\nRunes.\nThe only "magic" in the game early one was a fireball that would shoot out every so often depending on your magic stat. Nowe we have many different elements, and many different "styles" of attack. You have beams, you have AOE explosions, you have projectiles rain down from the sky, you have spiraling attacks. Right now good runes are basically a recharge over time gun.\n\nEnemies.\nFor a while the original website version only had one enemy. We now have different enemies for every level, and many new enemy behaviors. We have mummies, spiders, tikis, aliens, disco skeletons(yes, disco skeletons). Some enemies are game mode exclusives, so try all the modes out.\n\nBosses.\nAt one point they weren't a part of the original. You would just see how long you could last against the hordes of zombies.\n\nMods.\nThere were no mods in the original. Now we have artifacts, and mods. Mods fit in all guns, and can change a few basic things. Accuracy, fire rate, number of shots, etc. Most artifacts are a bit more powerful in theory. They add more than one characteristic to your guns. Change your bullets into lasers, or into lightning bolts, or homing rainbow projectiles! It gets pretty crazy once you have a good collection.\n\nMultiplayer.\nWent from a single player game, to multiplayer. PVP was added even more recently. Online play is being looked at. I'm really hoping that gets put in, as I believe it will benefit the game a lot. This game is neat, but it's just not as fun on your own.\n\nAI.\nWe now have AI "companions" that can join you in your fight. These aren't too bright, but they can help dish out some more damage to the varous monsters the game has.\n\nGetting to test, and offer feedback on this game has been a real treat. Playing has been fun too. Especially seeing all the progress that has been made. This game has great potential. It's been getting better, and better. I expect it to continue with that trend.\n\ntl:dr. It's a funky twin stick shooter best played with friends. It's getting better all the time, so at least check back later to see if something new catches your eye.","May 5","true","35.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I would much prefer a rating system for this game as opposed to recommending it or not\n\nPROS\n-Lots of weapon diversity (dozens of superweapons that devastate the enemy as well as upgrades you pick up in game that you can add to your normal weapons to give them a boost\n-Not super engrossing (Fun if you have 15-30 min to kill)\n-Easy to learn, hard to master\n\nCONS\n-you must have a wireless mouse in order to enjoy the full functionality of the game--without it you are forced to run around until you die\n-Adventure mode does not have a deep story, just randomly teleporting from place to place. Additionally, if you die, you have to start over from the beginning. More like survival than adventure.\n-overpriced in its current state. I paid the $7.99 because the game seemed very promising to me and wanted to support the dev, but if you are considering buying the game I suggest waiting for a sale.\n\nOverall grade: 7/10. I wouldn't recommend paying the full price right now, but it's your call.\n\nUPDATE: 5/25--Please nerf the moon boss or get rid of the randomizer. The moon boss is exponentially harder than any other boss in the game and it's kind of unfair to have to go up against him in the second stage because more often than not you end up losing and this gives an unfair advantage to players who win the level selection lottery.","March 11","true","13.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've always wanted a gun that shoots rainbows, mindlessly shoot shrooms so you can collect their dead bodies in order to pay off your car loan and the loan shark you got the loan from, you can do all those things... hopefully not that you got a loan shark.  Don't do that.  That's a no no.\n\nBut Zombie Party is the playful Rouge-lite that isn't too serious, but serious enough that the devs are wonderful and make ACTUAL updates that benefit how the game plays.\n\nFrom the gun mods that allow you to modify your guns on the fly to the pet system that makes your cat act like a Fallout 4 HalluciGen nightmare, the game has tight controls, pretty sweet gunplay, upgradeable characters via - GASP - CURRENCY YOU EARN THROUGH DUNGEONS, it's all the free game minus the cost of the game.  It's pretty damn sweet.\n\nI'll keep it short, but here are the positives:\n\n+ Gunplay is varied via modded weapons, different weapon types, buy different weapons (through earning currency to spend on perma-upgrades or buying them from a vendor in-game), SUPERGUNS (anyone want a taste of the ♥♥♥♥ing rainbow?  GIVE IT TO THEM)\n+ many different characters to unlock and upgrade!\n+ PETS - ON - LSD\n+ Sound design is good!\n+ Every map is procedurally generated, but environments remain the same per dungeon set (like dungeon 1 is a forest, 2 is a literal dungeon, 3 is a desert, etc.)\n+ Kind of adorable graphics (go with me here)\n+ Not overly serious and is fun to waste hours on\n+ HATS\n\nNegatives:\n- Sometimes can get stuck in the enviornment but that's a bug that's likely to get fixed\n- Upgrades only go /so/ far in its current state but you'll end up spending lots of time upgrading characters and unlocking them as you go\n\nZombie apocalypse/10: would endorse mass genocide to buy a hat again.","May 28","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
