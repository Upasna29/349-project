I'm a believer that great reviews include not only those that explain why the best games are the best games but also why others receive lower ratings.\n\nEra of Majesty is a promising game. It's what I would consider resource management. I concede that it could be classified as having RPG elements, but I have to assume that this description is more appropriate for future content as opposed to the game as it stands right now. RTS is also an appropriate description, as there is a certain amount of strategy that goes along with managing resources and allotting manpower for resource collection in an effort to build bigger and better structures.\n\nIf I were judging my rating based strictly on gameplay at this moment in time, I would have to honestly say that I don't recommend the game. However, I'm going against my better judgement and will instead recommend the game, but with a few caveats.\n\nTo begin with, the game is definitely in early access, as advertised. I think it's fantastic that developers can take advantage of crowdsourcing not just for funding but also to obtain feedback, observations, and reviews from scores of gamers who are essentially "paying beta-testers."\n\nWhen attempting any early access game, I expect a glitch or two. It's certainly not uncommon to find areas in an early access title that still need polishing. However, a title that's as close to release as this one seems to be should not have the game crashes and game-breaking bugs that I experienced. This game is just barely tipping the scale toward being a playable game vs one that's completely unplayable.\n\nGraphically speaking, the pixel graphics are attractive and clear. Graphics also include a day/night cycle and weather. The soundtrack is better than average, and the sound effects were appropiate for the game. I'd venture to say that the majority of the development hours have gone into graphics, sound, and framework for future updates.\n\nThe first thing you encounter is the tutorial, which is delivered in a text format that is confusing and incomplete. The tutorial is also full of poor grammar, spelling, and sentence structure. This is most likely due to poor translation. I also noticed that this tutorial cannot be turned off. My game crashed several times, making it necessary for me to begin a new game each time, and my only recourse was to hit the space bar multiple times to cycle through the tutorial.\n\nGameplay is also confusing. It's not readily apparent exactly what you're supposed to be doing, or how you're supposed to be achieving everything. The tutorial stated that right-clicking on a banner would allow me to move the banners and set the borders for my "town." However, I found that the gaming area simply wasn't that big, not more than 2-3 screens wide. I figured that moving the banners to each end would allow me the entire playing area that was available to me. I was incorrect about this, because I still had to right click and drag my mouse over items that I wanted to chop, mine, gather, or kill. Setting the border for the town was not all that was necessary for me to begin to gather resources.\n\nSide-scrolling movement works as it should, but other controls didn't function as well. On several occasions, I opened the menu to save the game, yet my game wasn't actually saved. At one point, I lost the ability to move my mouse cursor within the top inch of my screen, which meant that I couldn't "reach" the menu options and had no choice but to use the escape key to shut down the game and restart.\n\nI also experienced multiple occurrences of game crash with, "Fatal Error in action number 1 of Step Event0 for object o_enemy_unit." The only workable option for me when this happened was to click the "abort" key and re-launch the game.\n\nThe game refers to characters as, "units" yet it doesn't explain how additional units may be obtained. I learned through trial and error that I could level up those units, but it was not apparent to me how and when those skill points were awarded. It was also unclear what should be done when a unit dies.\n\nThe timing for the game is also unbalanced at this point. I played for more than an hour in between multiple game crashes, yet all I accomplished was the gathering of a small amount of wood, stone, mushrooms, and crystals. Keep in mind that this was while utilizing the fast-forward button to make gamplay speed up a bit. I was finally able to build the workbench, but I was never able to utilize it, because my game went from sporadic crashes to consistently crashing whenever I tried to use it. It's noteworthy that my gaming rig (ASUS ROG G752VT-DH72 17 Inch Gaming Laptop with a 6th Gen i7 Skylake processor, NVIDIA GTX 970, and Windows 10) is less than 2 month old and more than suitable to run the game.\n\nOn a positive note, the developers seem to be receptive to feedback and determined to see the project through to completion. There is also a fairly large player base already, so I think it's entirely appropriate to expect a finished product in the near future. If the building menu is any indication of what we can expect when this game is finished, I think it would be quite an entertaining game.\n\nI've heard others compare the game to Kingdom yet most agree that this game has the potential to be even better, and therein lies the rub when it comes to my review. I find myself allowing potential to push my rating from "not recommended" just over the line to "recommended for a specific audience."\n\nIf you enjoy casual resource management games and are willing to be patient, I think you'll find an active developer and player community. If, however, you're looking for a game that is more along the lines of an RPG or one that is "plug and play" and "out of the box" ready, then it's best that you wait until this game is completed or pick it up on sale.","March 11","true","3.3"," 21 of 24 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","21","24","0","0"

And developers are release updates often.\n+ Nice music, lovely background, interesting game.\n+ In the future will add cards and increase the world.\n\n- Small resource icon, maybe it's because of my small monitor.\n- A little difficult control and gameplay\n(What to do? What's next? What I have to build? Is it slime from Terraria? Cute sheep. Really, is it gold? Shut up and dig! Night and rain. Is it magic mushrooms? Need to try... Oh. Why did he die? Noooooo...  But we do not give up easily =) Start again)\n\nMaybe developers can make a big tutorial and bubble help when you hover the mouse on the icon of resource. I would be grateful if they could...\n\nIt's only early access, that's why 9/10. Dear developers, continue to work the same way and good luck.","March 5","true","4.3"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

For the most part, I do, but it seems to not get better as it has been updated. Some things have improved but some have lost quality. Now when your people die, their equipment can't be recovered? And the issue about not being able to continue a game once exited still exists.","February 28","true","11.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","6","11","0","0"
