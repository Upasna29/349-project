"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/recommended/362410/","Stefneh","Stefneh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Stefneh/","777 products in account","A fairly decent series of games to spend an afternoon on.\n\nI bought these games a while ago and just today decided to give them a go. To my surprise, the original series of games has been taken off of the store page and placed back on as one complete game, “Adam’s Venture Chronicles”. Which Steam has kindly given me a copy of as well.\n\nSeeing as I can’t review the separate episodes anymore, I’ll review them as a whole here. So despite my 5 minute playtime for Chronicles as of right now, I have played them! I will surely be saving Chronicles for if I ever want to revisit the trilogy. Which, isn’t entirely impossible.\n\nWith a total of 7.7 hours put into completing them separately, These games are fun and definitely the kind of game I was craving today, but I’m not going to hype it up too much.\n\nThe very first thing I noticed about these games was that you don’t control the camera. The camera pans and follows you. I got used to it very quickly and was actually surprised with how well it worked. But it made the games feel all the more linear. The game is linear as it is, but not even being able to look around kind of supresses the sense of exploration even more. I don’t particular find it a problem, I just thought it was worth mentioning.\n\nAs for the graphics in general, given how long ago the first episode came out (2009), I would say it looks pretty decent. It definitely has its moments.\n\nThe Puzzles are probably one of the most interesting parts to these games, they are interesting and fun to figure out, without being too mind bogglingly difficult. It’s always nice to see some new unfamiliar kinds of puzzles.\n\nThe characters are okay but nothing special. Admittedly the main character Adam did have me smiling a few times. The cocky, full of himself, almost arrogant, yet somehow still charming, character reminded me of the Deponia series’ “Rufus” in quite a few ways.\n\nDespite me thinking the characters themselves were alright, the voice acting generally isn’t the best quality. A few scenes made me cringe a little, but then again others I quite enjoyed. Just something to be wary of.\n\nIn terms of story it’s definitely playable and has its interesting parts. It doesn’t bore you to death but it’s definitely nothing too in-depth or profound. As far as I can tell it’s based around Christianity. I know very little about religious kinds of things so maybe for someone who follows the faith, this actually might be more interesting/clever? Either way, I still enjoyed it.\n\nIn terms of achievements, this would definitely be an easy 100%. Fortunately for me, playing them all separately, I managed to get 3 perfect games out of it. Each episode’s achievements were pretty straight forward to get. The majority are progression achievements, although there are some in there you can easily miss, so watch out.\n\nAll in all, this game is nothing amazing but it’s definitely worth playing. Anyone that likes adventure/puzzle games might get something out of this. It has a Tomb Raider kind of feel to it, with less emphasis on the platforming elements.\n\n\nTL;DR : Decent third-person adventure/puzzle game, it’s fun, challenging and can be completed 100% in under 8 hours. Despite it looking fairly old it definitely holds up. I’d say it’s worth a go.\n","August 29, 2015","true","0.1"," 22 of 25 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","22","25","0","0"

The game is easy indeed, logical obstacles can be overcome just in a few minutes of thinking, so difficulty is not the point in this game. For me, how I see it, Adam's Venture is a educational way of modern game-teaching of the bible stories and in this aspect the game achieved its goal.\n\nAbout story - Adam is a 1920's Indiana Jones in a nutshell.\n\nOver average.\n6/10\n\n(Don't look at the play time, I had finished all three parts before it was turned into chronicles)","August 26, 2015","true","0.1"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","81","22","27","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/recommended/362410/","Twistorian","Twistor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Twistorian/","4382 products in account","DISCLAIMER: I played the three episodes before Chronicles. If you wish you can read the original mixed reviews of each of them at E1, E2 and E3.\n\nTL;DR: Archeology-themed puzzle adventure game provides fun and challenging mental puzzles for several hours with a moderate story and annoying main character.\n\nThe new owners of the Adam's Venture IP are swell people: they provided Chronicles to everyone who owns the original three games. It's a good thing: there's very little difference to the originals aside from requiring to play it in order. Is it a good game though? Let's find out.\n\nYou are put into the overconfident boots of Adam Venture, an archeologist whose personality will likely both annoy the hell out of you and keep the story light-toned as he can at least be ridiculous in fun ways.\n\nStory begins as Adam and pals have supposedly found the lost location of the Garden of Eden. Flying there with the plane provided by the generous Clairvoux Corporation, you get trapped inside the maze of caves and have to solve logic puzzles and biblical phrase puzzles to proceed.\n\nYup, it's one of those Christian Games. Despite that, only the theme and ancient places are religious - the characters and the story are not and religion is not shoved down your throat. That said, knowing something about biblical stories might make the story more enjoyable because of the references. Text puzzles appear only in the first third (Garden of Eden) of the game though, and you can always guess the correct order of the phrases.\n\nMost of the puzzles are different logic puzzles. There is mixing dynamite, solving labyrinths and elaborate locks. There is fixing machines, lockpicking and wiring electronics. Puzzles are very varied and they get more challenging along the way, which is great. The puzzles in the end can be seriously challenging - I used a couple of hours to solve one (number lock puzzle) in my original playthrough, needlessly devising multilinear equations for what turned out to be a relatively simple puzzle once I saw its logic.\n\nI think only one puzzle (music puzzle in Garden of Eden) was illogical to me and that might be due to myself not knowing certain myth from the Bible. This was probably the only part where that might be kind of required, unless I simply missed a vital clue. I had to bruteforce it by trying every combination. In other parts the puzzles could be solved by thinking or simply trying enough combinations, iterating towards the right answer. Some knowledge of simple math and skills of pattern recognition make it easier and probably also more enjoyable.\n\nFrom the trailer it looks like a 3D action adventure but fortunately it isn't one, because the shadow effects are weak. This remains an issue in Chronicles as it was in the Episodes. While it looks fine enough, the environment does not react correctly to the dynamic lightning like torches. This manifests so that Adam and all the characters cast dynamic shadows but the environmental objects like stones or stalagmites do not even though light illuminates them correctly. Specifically, Adam's shadow might be hanging on the ceiling like in mid-air, because the stone he's standing on does not cast a shadow.\n\nThis is fortunately a minor issue but it makes it difficult to find some secret areas and in the (thankfully few) platforming and swinging blades sections it's difficult to see the direction where you are supposed to jump towards or assess the blade's path. Also fortunately dying just respawns you back at the same section, so at least you lose nothing because of the death. Only if Evelyn is with you do you need to hear her scolding voice saying "Adam!" in that particular way that's akin to "Stop dying fooling around!".\n\nLike said, Adam is an annoying guy. He boasts that he's awesome and he sure does have a knack for alternative solutions (like a true adventure game character should). Evelyn, his companion character, shows that she has much more common sense and the contrast is actually pretty funny. Nevertheless, Adam belittles her all the time like a tool he is while at the same time hitting on her. I found this very annoying but satisfyingly enough he gets called for it.\n\nAdam and Eve(lyn) is of course a play on the story of Genesis and it's used in the Garden of Eden as a joke. Myself, I found Garden of Eden (the first episode of the series) to be the weakest part of the game. After that it gets much more interesting as the deviousness of the Clairvoux Corporation begins to unfold.\n\nMy original playthrough of the Episodes lasted 10 hours altogether (it took only 6 hours for this replay). Of course, now there's an option to play any sub-chapter again after you have played it through to go for those elusive achievements. Controller support has been improved, though sometimes the pad buttons appear on the HUD instead of the keyboard keys.\n\nIt's a decent adventure game with some good, challenging puzzles and an okay story. The differences to the original Episodes are very small so if you've played them already, you can only play this for a rerun or the achievements. For the rest of you I can't recommend it for the full price but at 50% or 75% discount it's good enough a tale.","October 15, 2015","true","6.0"," 14 of 14 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","14","14","0","0"

Trying to impress his father's assistant, Evelyn Appleby, he doesn't know that he will live a real adventure, even making him reminiscing the two years earlier.\n\nThe main goal of the first chapters is to discover some tales from the Bible, after that, it's more centered on the fun and gameplay than the Bible. The story is a good little one, if only there wasn't a problem in the chronology: it seems that Adam discovered the location of the garden the same year he's stuck in, yet, the flashback shows that it was three years earlier.\n\nBesides, the fact that Adam is a bit sexist: you can see that Evelyn is more mature than Adam. But I don't know if this side of him is his way to show that he cares a lot about her or if he's really like that. Also, Adam is the comical relief of the game: he's thinking that he's the best but in a theatrical manner.\n\nThe gameplay is simple as it's an adventure game: you solve puzzles mainly. They're not hard but also not so easy. I can't really say it's flawed but when you have weird camera angles, your job is harder than before.\n\nThe graphics would be called outdated in our world, yet, I love them. I largely prefer the atmosphere in the Eden story, more mysterious. But the others chapters are also very good - I liked less the flashback in France.\n\nThe soundtrack is also fitting to the game and the voice acting isn't as bad as you could expect. Maybe the Clairvaux chief is perhaps a little too much in his arrogance but it can still pass.\n\n20 bucks is probably too much for the collection, as the episodes were known to often be in weekly sales at 1,24 euros. So, if I was you, I would wait for a good discount.\n\nBut I've enjoyed Adam Venture a lot so, I can only recommend it... if you can get past Adam's little sexist side.","October 11, 2015","true","4.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","1"

This game is still for the budget fascinating, the story (Eden, Adam and Eve(lyn APPLEby, a dark shadow that waits for the wrong turn/ choice like a snake and Salomon temple, family tree and biggest treature (SPOILER! WISDOM?  BOOK!) is unique, the graphics for a small studio is good and detailed. The places are fine, the puzzles are well balanced and the end shows what is important. I still hope for a second part maybe find Noahs Ship or the Ark of the Covenant with the Decalogue? I would find it great. Sound is okay. So decide wisely to buy or not and when yes how much. Dont get disappointed because you dont like the genre or dont understand the story backround good enough. Simple games like this makes my childhood so great. No super graphic but flair of mysterious. Sure could be more and the price is to high for the game but developer invest many time, money and skills to get it. So i thanks all developers in the world for a great time all time i played. I give this INDIE title 90 % for me, but the game has weakpoints like the jumping system and others. Watch trailer, lets play and think 2 times before you buy it, then its your fault no one else.

So, despite the short playtime - I did complete this game, and even reviewed the first two episodes (and those two probably just faded away). I'll take it as a chance to review the entire game and not each episode seperately.\n\nWhile I don't find the game amazing, it does get better as you progress, and eventually it's an alright "action"-adventure game. It is rather casual, though, in almost every aspect. If that's your cup of tea then you might want to give it a chance.\n\nAdam's Venture is supposedly an action-adventure game which seems like a childish version of games like Tomb Raider or Uncharted, definitely not as good, and seems a little like a 'wannabe'.\n\nOn the technical aspects the game swings from decent to nice quality. Again, nothing special or memorable unfortunately. It seemed to me like the graphics got better optimized in the third chapter somehow, as it ran smoothly on my machine with highest settings while the first one was faltering on medium, and my machine definitely has the recommended system requirements (this game does get old..)\n\nThe story is a cliche but actually a nice one. As I said, it's all very casual and so there's nothing too bombastic or complex. Acting is decent but not a major part of this game.\n\nGameplay is fairly simple, rather linear with numerous puzzles along the way, which start out ridicolously easy but on the third chapter become somewhat more challanging (and at times obscure and unclear).\n\nWhen I reviewed the first and second episode I've written that this game is good for children, but somehow on the third episode the difficulty significantly rises and therefore I'm not too sure about that anymore.\n\nAnyway, as I said, the game does get better from episode to episode, and for that reason alone I find it a little hard to review all the 3 episodes.\nWhile the 1st one didn't leave such a good impression on me, the 3rd actually made me like this game much more.\n\nAdam's Venture isn't terrific, but it's an OK piece of adventure. The rather boring first episode evolves and becomes mroe fun and bearable in the second and third ones.\nIt took me about 2-3 hours to complete each episdoes, which gives you in a whole a 6-9 hours experience for 20$, depending on your gameplay style.\n\nThat's a little steep for this game, and I'd say - get it on a sale like I did. If you're a die-hard fan of adventure games you'll enjoy it.\nAs a parent you could play it with your kid perhaps, and that might also be nice.\n\nReally, that's a fine game.

Sure the way through the maze and solution to the bomb puzzle are different but it is the idetical maze and room. This was a lazy move made by the creators. Adam's constant belitteling of Evelyn (female protagonist) was incredibly anti-feminist, humorless, and made it even more painful to listen to the poorly written dialogue (there were instances where Everlyn repeated dialogue from past scenes).","May 10","false","7.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
