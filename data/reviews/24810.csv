"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/recommended/24810/","TeamTom","TeamTom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeamTom/","2819 products in account","Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath is actually an expansion pack for Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars, which I haven’t covered yet, and played these in the wrong order; that being said, I can still give a review on this game as an individual release.\n\nCommand & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath was released in early 2008 before actually being released on the 360 console if you can believe it. This is the first C&C game I have played since Generals in 2003. This game takes place between the time of Tiberian Sun and the start of Tiberium Wars plot wise, so if you want to play the games chronologically, start with this one before Wars.\n\nThe single player campaign has 13 levels which are divided up into three different sub-stories which follow Kane’s plot.  In all good C&C fashion, there are two types of missions, base building missions and more stealth operation missions. The base building missions can normally be completed by overrunning your enemy with your army of tanks an d troops, and just play the numbers game. There is a good amount of buildings to use, but there are only handfuls which actually have some real use in terms of game play. If  you want to be playing this game optimally, there are really only 4 or 5 buildings you’ll be using.  The second type of mission which gives you control of a smaller force of units, meaning you have to use an element of either stealth or well planned attacks in order to complete objectives. These missions are the hardest, but they present the greatest amount of fun in this title.  They really do give you a serious element of strategy and planning which is what you would expect to see from a C&C game.\n\nThis game is eight years old now, and whilst none of the C&C games ever had super amazing graphics, some may be put off by the graphically old style to this game. There are some low texture qualities to be seen in abundance,  but you really only see these if you are zoomed as far in as you can go, and you will hardly ever want to do this as you are overseeing the whole battlefield anyway.  The game is fully voice acted and has very well made cut scenes in between levels which have live action taking place, with some celebrity cast members such as Joseph Kucan returning as Kane, Carl Lumbly, and Canadian actress and fashion model, Natasha Henstridge\n\nThe base building missions are really quite ease – like I said you can just use the numbers game against the opponents and overrun them with a huge army. Where the game challenges is the other missions. The game can be played on varying levels of difficulty so you can tailor it to how much of a threat you want your adversaries to cause you.\n\nAll of the thirteen missions come with their main objective, along with optional objectives for you to complete. Completing these bear no real game play bonus’ apart from a higher rank at the end of the mission, what they do offer you is a greater knowledge of the lore and plot going on behind the scenes, so fans of the series should definitely be taking the time to read through the extra bits of story you get.\n\nThe game took me just about fifteen hours to finish; I am very happy with that length of time for a RTS game like this, and it matches the full price tag quite fairly too. The multiplayer scene is fairly dead on this game as the official servers were taken offline, so it’s only a single player experience from now on. The game has a few other game modes which include a Risk style game, and of course, just general skirmishes against the AI, all of which add to the replay ability of this game.\n\nThe only major technical issue I had whilst playing, was that I could not get the game to run in 4k resolutions. Whilst it is an option in the menu, the game will crash when trying to select it. 1080p works fine and runs at over 60 FPS all of the time when maxed out.  Keyboard and mouse is an absolute must whilst playing too; even though the game was released on xbox360, the controller doesn’t work on the PC title for some reason?\n\nIn conclusion, Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath is a quality C&C release, whilst it may not be as fully polished as the previous games in the series, it still has some really stellar gameplay and an interesting plot. The price tag of £9,99 is right on point as well. You cannot go wrong with picking this game up now.\n\nTom's Score Card\n1) Stay away\n2) Not Recommended\n3) Only recommended when on sale\n4) Recommended\n5) Highly recommended\n6) This is a must play\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider giving it a thumbs up.

I've loved the CNC and Red Alert series since RA1, what a classic. But this is, sadly, the best, most recent game out of both series (in my opinion).\n\nI haven't played much of the single player, because WHY? The skirmishes are so fun, there are many different strategies to try out, try different challenges like vs one easy AI and two Hard, capture the easy base early game with minimal resources, e.g. engineer and a few troops, get their tech, have yourself TWO ultimate units, MARV and REDEEMER for example. The unit ranking system is basic but great, very rewarding for looking after your units and keeping them alive through battle trades.\n\nThe graphics are great for its age, someone else mentioned about the sound design and yes, I agree, it's awesome. Explosions sound big, siege weapons sound like siege weapons, and units have some great dialogue which you'll catch yourself saying.\n\nMammoth Tank - "Armoured superiority" "Ready here"\n\nNod Harvester - "It's time for harvest" "The beautiful glow"\n\nThere is still a community out there for multiplayer matches, another reviewer mentioned about the symmetry of the maps, but it's not ALL maps, it's mostly the "tournament maps" which is for... Tournaments. The symmetry is for balance.\n\nHowever, I do have a gripe for it, and it frustrates me a lot. With so much multiplayer and skirmish potential, I would have loved to have seen more community maps, challenges, missions. But there is almost none through steam. This game is probably past its time to have a big revival, but if you can grab it on a steam sale, I wouldn't hesitate a second.\n\nEA have recently cancelled their F2P model game, which I think is a good move. F2P CnC won't work, I am thoroughly looking forward to a new CnC which will hopefully keep up to this level and more. Don't let us down EA! (Wishful thinking I know)\n\nTL;DR - If the game is on sale, buy it, but don't expect there to be a massive community on Steam. However, there are plenty of people doing game commentaries, one I like is a guy called GreenZero over on YouTube. Check out gamereplays.org too for replays, have a search on google for some custom maps too. I've had many hours of fun with this game (as you can see) plus hours I had with a non-steam copy. Highly reccomended.\n\nMy raiting - 4.5/5 I would give it 5/5 if there was better support and community here on Steam.\n\nThanks for reading my review, I hope it helps!","November 27, 2013","true","182.3"," 49 of 51 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","49","51","2","1"

See Conclusion\nNOTE: Related ContentAlso see my:\nCommand & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars Review\nCommand & Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight\n\nINTRODUCTION:Command and Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath is the official expansion pack to the critically acclaimed real-time strategy game Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars.\n\nUnlike its predecessors, Kane's Wrath handles its campaign in a more disjointed fashion rather than the linear approach of the older titles. This game follows the 'ascension' of L.E.G.I.O.N., a newly developed and highly experimental Combat A.I. The game has missions based on the various stages of the Tiberian Sun Story Arc such as the end of Tiberian Sun: Firestorm, the start of Tiberium Wars and the events that came after it.\n\nPROS:+ The game has good art style and graphics: (Both of which aged really well specially since this game was released back in 2008.)\n+ Very good Sound design and unit voice acting.\n+ Quality live action cinematics have returned along with the ever iconic Joseph D. Kucan as “Kane.”\n+ New 'Sub-factions' that are fun to use and adds variety to the gameplay\n+ Adds new units to play with\n+ Return of some of the Tiberian Sun favorites, such as GDI Titans and Wolverines as well as the NOD Cyborgs and Artillery. NOD infantry also got their iconic NOD Combat Armors back.\n+ Fast paced and intense action\n+ Lore and story continuity from the old games\n+ Campaign missions (specially the Stealth based ones are still as fun as ever)\n+ Fun new skirmish maps and multiplayer maps\n+ Adds a new game mode called “Global Conquest” similar to Red Alert 3: Uprising's 'Commander's Challenge'.\n\nCONS:- No online multiplayer due to GameSpy shutdown: FIX[cnc-online.net]\n- Some unit pathfinding quirks (specially with the massive 'Mega Units' like the Redeemer and MARV)\n- Balance issues\n- No GDI or Scrin Campaign\n- Relatively shorter Campaign game time: (mostly because there's only the NOD campaign which can last you at least 9-10 hours)\n- More expensive than the base game (Tiberium Wars) for some reason\n\nNEUTRAL+/- The disjointed story may not appeal to most old school Command & Conquer fans\n+/- The story can only be understood by both Tiberian Sun and Tiberium Wars veteran players.\n\nCONCLUSION:GOOD EXPANSION that manages to spice up the C&C3 universe with new content and gameplay while at the same time being able to connect and reveal many untold stories about the Brotherhood of Nod and their leader Kane.\n\nWORTH IT?The game's full price is $20 (or your regional equivalent) which is $5 more expensive than the base game so I can only recommend this expansion pack only to Tiberian Sun and Tiberium Wars veteran players. If you're looking for your first RTS game, get Tiberium Wars instead.\n\nAgain I have to point out the fact that the official multiplayer servers are now permanently offline so you'll have to use CNC:Online[cnc-online.net]  if you want to experience the game's online multiplayer feature.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------\nLike my Reviews?

These sub-factions also have their own exclusive units and overall play styles; in addition there's a new game mode known as global conquest to which the player tries to achieve global domination. This game mode includes TBS & RTS gameplay elements .\n\nSTORY:\n\nWhat really sells this game as a MUST PLAY is the story, assuming you're a Tiberium Universe fanatic.\n\nOverall, Kanes Wrath is an expansion pack soley intended to tell the story of Nod and Kanes actions that consist of 13 missions seperated into three acts. These acts cover just about two decades from 2034 to 2052.\n\nTo avoid spoiling the campaign, I'll keep this brief.\n\nAs the player, your perspective is LEGION -an A.I. created by Kane intended to be CABALS successor- and throughout the duration of this campaign, Kane instructs LEGION to do his bidding until the A.I's true purpose can be done (hint CABAL's purpose).\n\nAs the player, you'll experience what Kane was up to post-Tiberian Sun (post-Second Tiberium War) as well as pre-C&C3 (pre-Third Tiberium War); in addition to actually experiencing battles of C&C3 from a different perspective. After that, you'll experience post-C&C3 events.\n\nMULTIPLAYER:\nAs a heads up / tip, if you wish to play this game online as of 2015 then visit http://cnc-online.net/\n\nONE VISION, ONE PURPOSE out of 10.","April 12, 2015","true","0.9"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","25","28","0","0"

While the game offers new missions and cutscenes, one downside is that we only have one new campaign this time (I guess the developers ran out of both money and time to complete the rest).\n\nYou have new units, as usual, and the missions are a bit more difficult this being an expansion pack. This is normal as the creators always assume you've played the original one.\n\nHonestly? I don't remember much. I remember it being good and I remember that Kane could deliver once more.

It can get really crazy if you don't know the advantages/disadvantages of your opponent.\n\nHero Units:\nYou can only have one of these at any given time, and I don't mean commandoes, what I'm talking about is a massive vehicle garrisonable by multiple infantry that can wreck any lesser unit within a fraction of a second. Different infantry units add different effects, so while Rocket infantry adds rocket launchers an engineer adds a self-repair module. etc. etc.\n\nCampaign:\nSadly there is only a Nod campaign in the game, but I can't really complain since Nod has most of my favorite units.\n\nMultiplayer:\nThe official servers are down AFAIK, but you can still play via tunngle or hamachi or whatever you prefer.\n\nTL;DR:\nShould you buy it? Yes. Yes you should. Go and buy it, it's 75% off right now, and you can get CNC3 and KW for 5€ total.","December 3, 2014","true","58.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

After this game EA made CnC4 which pretty much killed off the series for everybody.\n\nThis game fills the holes between CnC: Tiberian Sun and CnC: Tiberium Wars. For many of us fans of the series it was alittle weird to see Kane in that tube at the end of CnC: Tiberian Sun Firestorm and then in CnC: Tiberium Wars hes back without any explination whatsoever.\n\nThe story starts right after the Firestorm crisis and you play as Legion and you take direct orders from Kane. You need to like help Kane out and ♥♥♥♥ because since hes recent disappearance the Brotherhood of Nod has been split up and such so it falls to you to fix all of that and unite Nod again.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty nice and in muliplayer you can pick alot of factions to play as(Kinda like in CnC: Generals Zero Hour). I would myself recomend that you play as regular Nod and Steel Talons. Regular Nod since they are awesome(DUUUH) and Steel Talons since they got retro units like the Titan and Wolvorine.(It never really made any sense to me why GDI went from Mammoth tanks to Titans and then went back to Mammoth tanks again so thanks EA for the confussion.)\n\nI give this game a 8/10 because its still pretty awesome and it got that metal version of Act on Instinct","March 9, 2014","true","19.6"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","1"

Gameplay hasn't changed that much since the original C&C3.\n\nAlthough the game is called "Kane's Wrath" it would have been much better to have a GDI campaign added to the game.  With that being said though the acting in this game is brilliant and Kane is one of the better characters, although the missions in the campaign are not that great.\n\nHowever you can still play as all 9 factions (each core faction has 2 subfactions).  Each faction has different units, upgrades and playstyles which does add some variety to the game.\n\nThere's also a conquest mode which is a "Risk" type mode where you can play as either faction and have to take over the world (The console version replaces this with Kane's challenge), and is for the most part a solid experience.\n\nI can recommend this expansion pack, but not all full price.","September 7, 2014","true","18.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It functions as an exposition piece giving you information about the events leading up to the third Tiberium War, during and the aftermath.\n\nYou take the role of Legion, Kane's tactical AI mastermind and most of the in-game cut scenes are spent in one of his bunkers, listening to Kane's various rants. In general the live action quality of this expansion is well below C&C standards and most of them take place in dark rooms with very few actors involved.\n\nThe gameplay element of this expansion is mostly centered around sub-factions each with it's own specialty, most notable is NOD's flame based sub-faction. The gameplay effects is however mostly negligible, particularly in terms of single player.\n\nAll in all, it joins the "Standard Expansion" club.

It is one of the last old-school RTS games where the designers had both budget and creative freedom, one of the last full expansions before the days of piecemeal DLC and probably the last great Command & Conquer. It also meant something new in C&C history, namely an add-on dedicated to the Brotherhood of Nod.\n\nThose uninitiated in the lore would do best to start with Tiberium Wars and watching the preceding C&C cutscenes from Youtube. This is to ensure the plot makes at least some sense, not that C&C is meant to make one rethink ones life. The three chapters in the 13-mission campaign happen before, during and after Tiberium Wars thus completing the storyline. Joseph Kucan's Kane is still the greatest FMV villain in gaming history and I will never tire of his superhuman scheming. Carl Lumbly as Brother Marcion is an entertaining Evil Evangelist whereas Natasha Henstridge has blonde hair and says things.\n\nAll three factions (the alien Scrin made their entrance in the base game) are further split into three sub-factions all of whom get new toys to conquer the digital Earth with. Not all are equally interesting or receive enough playtime in the campaign but enough changes are made to give the gameplay new freshness. The gameplay itself has stayed the same, of course, with units being built and lost quite quickly. A typical campaign mission does not go past the 30-minute mark and mission design is varied enough to maintain interest throughout. Sights and sounds are good even today, despite all the advancements and changes in hardware, with the deliciously evil unit quotes getting a special mention. There is also the Global Conquest mode, with it's Risk-style metagame built around the skirmishes. It is not greatness but as an added amusement it is worthwhile indeed.\n\nAll this combines into a great 10 € package that I can wholeheartedly recommend for fans of commanding and conquering and real-time strategizing.","October 11, 2013","true","8.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

C&C Tiberium Alliances today is a browsergame, substituting the scrapped Generals 2 even as it was in beta stage, and C&C4: Tiberian Twilight was a massive flop, EA has finally killed the C&C genre as a true RTS, for now everything has a timer attached to it and is played in turns, leaving fans of the Tiberium Wars series with a game that was brought out in 2008. GameSpy servers were taken down some time ago, so now we have to play on Tunngle, Hamachi, and since recently a server was created for all the games that were on the shut down GameSpy servers, namely: C&C Red Alert 3 and its expansion, C&C Generals and its expansion Zero Hour, C&C3: Tiberium Wars and Kane's wrath. Check Revora forums for more info. I already played it in 2008-2009, and find it's still the best C&C to date.\n\nUseful links:\nhttp://cnc-online.net/  -- the substitute server for all games that were on shutdown GameSpy servers, including a How-To to get you started\nhttp://www.gamereplays.org/kaneswrath/  -- can find many (expert)replays here, and probably all the strats and BO's you could ever wish for.","January 5, 2015","true","279.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has delivered moderately fun, offers the new fancy race SCRIN to try out and comes with each race +3 subfractions for different tactics with each different advantages and disadvantages. The graphics are more than good, sound design is very good too, but about the story i am not sure to agree with. What i especially dislike is the build-in badwords filter. Also the skirmish map's are almost all symmetric, which is not impressing me a little.

Pathfinding is awful unit, controls are no always intuitive, telling the difference between passable and impassable terrain is sometimes near-impossible and some units feel useless while others will end up being the only units you ever build. Unlike its successor in Red Alert 3 this game doesn't really beg comparison to more modern RTS games such as Starcraft 2 however I will say that in pure gameplay terms this is no longer a groundbreaking RTS.\n\nThat said though the campaign is fun and fits in with the story of the universe quite nicely. It doesn't do too much to advance the greater plot and at times the cutscenes can feel a bit limited to simply Kane monologues. All in all the campaign is nice if a bit sparse compared to C&C3.\n\nMissions can be quite unique and fun and fit in well with the story. If you are more a fan of straight up kill the enemy missions unlike SC2s method of always having a gimick that changes gameplay this may be more of the RTS for you.\n\nThe Risk-like Global conquest mode is dull and uninteresting after one playthrough it doesn't add anything to the game and battles are rushed and uninteresting. Skirmish is better if you are looking for fun vs AI battles.\n\nOverall I feel this is a game that hasn't aged too well in comparison to those that followed however the core game and capaign is still good and fun if you are a fan of the series or genre.","September 23, 2015","true","4.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

C&C 4 and Tiberium Alliances may use NOD and GDI, but have barely anything more to do with C&C than that.\n\nThat being said, C&C 3: Kane's Wrath is (in my opinion) the absolutely best game out of the whole series. While C&C 3 added the Scrin in a daring move and pulled it off graciously, C&C 3 KW added 6 subfactions, 2 for each major faction, and pulled that off graciously as well. Fights feel very balanced with no such thing as 'that one faction you have to pick in order to win'.\n\nIt also continues the story of Kane, which I personally always found insanely interesting. Tiny spoiler, Kane is not human. But I guess after countless iterations of 'Kane lives!' everyone should expect that. Is he a scrin? Not impossible but I somehow don't really think so. I'd die for an actual, real and awesome sequel with the true spirit and the real story of C&C, that keeps building on the story of the franchise. Alas, this will probably stay the lest real C&C, even if I and many others hope otherwise. Mind you, I played C&C4, but it just feels... wrong. I didn't preceive it as bad as most others, but it felt bad and wrong enough.\n\nBack in the day I had finished all campaign missions, all skirmishes on brutal as well as the global conquest thingy, so after letting the nostalgia lighten up once more, I guess I will finally put this game to rest. I don't regret one minute I spent with it. If you haven't played C&C 3 yet, get it. If you like RTS you should love Kane's Wrath.","May 12, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Now, make a Nod sub-faction that gives a Black Hand unit to all infantry units.\n\nAnd then give it an upgrade that turns flamethrower jets blue and increases their damage by a ludicrous amount. That is Purifying Flame. One flame tank takes 3-4 seconds to take down a big building.\n\n--\n\nOther than that, it features a third campaign that helps you see what happened between C&C2's aftermath and C&C3's campaign, 2 sub-factions for every one of the C&C3 factions (so, 2 GDI ones, 2 Nod ones and 2 Scrin ones).\n\nIt also has the Purifying Flame upgrade for the Black Hand Nod sub-faction, which is insane. It bears repeating. The Purifying Flame upgrade is INSANE.","January 10, 2011","true","5.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are Command and Conquer fan or you bought C & C 3 at some point, I can recommend getting this.

C&C 4 and Tiberium Alliances may use NOD and GDI, but have barely anything more to do with C&C than that.\n\nThat being said, C&C 3: Kane's Wrath is (in my opinion) the absolutely best game out of the whole series. While C&C 3 added the Scrin in a daring move and pulled it off graciously, C&C 3 KW added 6 subfactions, 2 for each major faction, and pulled that off graciously as well. Fights feel very balanced with no such thing as 'that one faction you have to pick in order to win'.\n\nIt also continues the story of Kane, which I personally always found insanely interesting. Tiny spoiler, Kane is not human. But I guess after countless iterations of 'Kane lives!' everyone should expect that. Is he a scrin? Not impossible but I somehow don't really think so. I'd die for an actual, real and awesome sequel with the true spirit and the real story of C&C, that keeps building on the story of the franchise. Alas, this will probably stay the lest real C&C, even if I and many others hope otherwise. Mind you, I played C&C4, but it just feels... wrong. I didn't preceive it as bad as most others, but it felt bad and wrong enough.\n\nBack in the day I had finished all campaign missions, all skirmishes on brutal as well as the global conquest thingy, so after letting the nostalgia lighten up once more, I guess I will finally put this game to rest. I don't regret one minute I spent with it. If you haven't played C&C 3 yet, get it. If you like RTS you should love Kane's Wrath.","May 12, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good.\n\nThis tactical game (an add-on for Command and Conquer 3) is still extremely difficult but nearly every overly frustrating, unfair or buggy aspect of the original game has been fixed and the new additions of this add-on fit right in. Better than the original in every way, Kane's Wrath is one of the most fun tactical games I have ever played.\n\nThe various sides are well-balanced against each other and each side has 3 variants. Each variant which all plays differently while no side has a clear superiority (though the Scrin are still quite a bit over-powerful but their confusing, extremely alien units help make up for their slightly overpowered nature, at least initially). The main campaign is potentially easy (if you play on easy) and has an interesting (though often confusing and disjointed) plot which pretty much requires you to be a fan of the franchise to understand what is going on (but understanding the overall plot is not necessary so far as winning the game is concerned). Skirmish mode really shines with lots of maps and ways to play each battle. The Risk-styled Global Conquest mode is somewhat fun (but is probably the weakest link in this add-on) and feels tacked on to the rest of the game. Global Conquest often involves extremely one-sided tactical battles (one way or another) throughout. Global Conquest mode also does not allow you to use units which you created during one battle in any other battle but the global-domination standpoint of this mode is quite entertaining (but becomes repetitive after 40+ turns).\n","January 7","true","25.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you've played the C&C series before, you won't find it hard to get into the story plot being presented, included with your all time favortie Joe Kucan as Kane, forever and always. Despite Electronics Arts beating the canon pretty hard, Kane is enough to usually keep me playing for a bit.\n\nThe actual format of the game itself is pretty simple enough, sticking to the basics, you control your MCV, which acts as your headquarters and main building unit, thus losing one early game usually spells defeat. Much of the combat is rock paper scissor style, however a combination of units is usually required to mount succesful offensive and defense operations against the enemy. Unit garrison of buildings can provide for some amusing early game attrition warfare, until the game gradually reaches mid-game and late-game, in which the bigger and more ridiculous units make their approach.\n\nBeing an old classic, I would recommend this game to most general strategists, however if you're looking for an intense strategy, this might not be what you're looking for.\n\nKane lives!","November 27, 2015","true","16.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I must have logged over 300 hours of that game (This was before I had ever heard of Steam). Then one day my computer broke and I had to take it in for repairs. I accidentally left the CD in when I took it and when I got my PC back it was gone. I was devistated, but a year later when I jumped on the steam train, I bought it back. It was still the great game I know and love as one of my first games and the game that defines realtime strat for me. Unlinke most, I have always played the game on "slow mode". By slow mode I just turn the game speed to very low. I was a kid whe I first started so I needed it to be slow, but even now and I still keep it on slow because thats how I fell in love with it. But this game offers many things like that to help out people new to real time strats. I highly reccommend this game to any type of gamer of any age. This is my favorite game of all time and I hope will give this game a chance.","October 21, 2015","true","53.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good.\n\nThis tactical game (an add-on for Command and Conquer 3) is still extremely difficult but nearly every overly frustrating, unfair or buggy aspect of the original game has been fixed and the new additions of this add-on fit right in. Better than the original in every way, Kane's Wrath is one of the most fun tactical games I have ever played.\n\nThe various sides are well-balanced against each other and each side has 3 variants. Each variant which all plays differently while no side has a clear superiority (though the Scrin are still quite a bit over-powerful but their confusing, extremely alien units help make up for their slightly overpowered nature, at least initially). The main campaign is potentially easy (if you play on easy) and has an interesting (though often confusing and disjointed) plot which pretty much requires you to be a fan of the franchise to understand what is going on (but understanding the overall plot is not necessary so far as winning the game is concerned). Skirmish mode really shines with lots of maps and ways to play each battle. The Risk-styled Global Conquest mode is somewhat fun (but is probably the weakest link in this add-on) and feels tacked on to the rest of the game. Global Conquest often involves extremely one-sided tactical battles (one way or another) throughout. Global Conquest mode also does not allow you to use units which you created during one battle in any other battle but the global-domination standpoint of this mode is quite entertaining (but becomes repetitive after 40+ turns).\n","January 7","true","25.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
