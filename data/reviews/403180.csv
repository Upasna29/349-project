I kind of hate that but that's personal taste.\n\nSecondly, you don't have to make a stick man for your character which is pretty great because I got to make a mudkip. ♥♥♥♥. Yes. The second character you make is more or less your enemy but I think you're trying to save him or something?\n\nThe gameplay on the first level is alright. You pick up this green pencil thing and all of the trees that are missing leaves you kind of scribble on to add leaves to them. This then allows you to move some of the deadly sludge out of the way so you can progress or kill some enemies. That's right, no weapons on the first level unfortunately. However after you beat the first level if you don't like how your character looks or walks with animation you pick up a sketchbook which allows you to draw more characters or enemies. So don't fret to much if it looks clunky at first.\n\nAlso, I really made this because I was trying to quit out of the game while I go smoke (so I wouldn't go over the two hours in case I ran into some reason to get a refund) and I could not find a quit button. I might be an idiot (hopefully) but i had to open up my task manager to quit the game which is a big no-no.\n\nOverall, this game being on sell for $3 seems well worth it unless I run into something awful, which I will immediately update this review with.\n\nUpdate:\n\nOkay. I had no clue this was a puzzle game. It might have been in the tags but I guess I missed it or something. The game is actually pretty thought provoking and continuously builds upon the abilities and mechanics you learn. You actually have to use your brain for some of the puzzles and there is some light comedic moments in this game as well.\n\nSo far it seems like you will have to back track to get some of the unlockable items, which I despise being in games but whatever. And yes, there is no quit button, you're going to have to task manager to quit this gem. Also, you might want to mute the game while you play because the human-people-npc-guys make this squeaky noise that sounds absolutely awful...\n\nOverall I'd give it a 9/10 because it feels pretty unique in it's ideas and it's actually a good puzzle game.\n\nUpdate 2 that's not necessary:\n\nWell. It only took a little under 3 hours to beat the game 100%, which is a shame honestly. There's only eight levels apparently and none of them are particularly long if you have a good head on your shoulders. I believe this was a mobile port as well since it has a pop up window asking you to rate it, and then it has a big ♥♥♥ button on the home menu that brings you to their website and reads "play more games."\n\nI'd say buy it for the $3 but the full asking price is kind of pushing it. This is steam, not a phone or tablet. If you think you'd let your little sister or brother play this game after you beat it and you know how to erase all of your stuff so as they can start out fresh, then I'd say get it at the full price but $3 is honestly more than enough for this game, regardless of how much I love being a mudkip with a lightsaber.","November 6, 2015","true","3.8"," 41 of 50 people (82%) found this review helpful 19 people found this review funny","82","41","50","19","10"

It is more for relaxing and fun, and hilarious too.\n\nFirst in the game you customize you own character, well draw you own character. You can make it ANYTHING you want, I saw ppl drew minions lol. Some colors are locked and you need to collect the color dude (not sure what's that called) in the game to unlock more. One thing I want complain though, my drawing tablet doesn't work! I was going to draw some fancy stuff but somehow this game just not compatible with it.\n\nThe game itself is kinda short, you can probably finish it in like 3hrs or so if you are not up to collecting everything. There are extra stuff that can be collected if you replay the game after finishing it. The plot is similiar to the last one where yr gril/boy got kidnapped and u need to get her/him back.\n\nOverall, it's great. Very amusing. Maybe a 8/10","December 2, 2015","true","6.4"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","5","6","0","0"

In this game, if you want to unlock everything, you have to get to the end and then use all the crayons you have gathered to do things you have yet to do. Collect crayons through out the game that do different things,  so you can draw your way through these puzzles. At the beggining, you draw yourself and a friend(which becomes evil,), and your quest is to save your friend.\n\n9/10 because I really wish,(even though it might be sopposed to be simple,) that there was more to it, more levels, and harder puzzles. Plus, I also want to be able to save the friend I make so they are not evil anymore.\n\nThanks for reading my post :D","February 26","true","4.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

It involves you going to save your friend, who has been possessed by something called the "Inkvil". If you like games like Drawn to Life, this is pretty similar; you get to draw whatever you like. The music has a nice, calming feel, with chiptune laced into the compositions, and you can share your designs. The boss battles are also quite tricky.\n\nBUT there are some complaints, the main one being that it's extremely short, even for a five-dollar game; you can literally complete it in 2-3 hours if you know what you're doing. The other complaint - at least for me - is that the battle system is weird, even for. And also, there's no eraser function. If I want to remove some unnecessary edges, i'd have to undo it and probably make that same mistake again. But these last two are rather minor complaints.\n\nAt least it's cute.\n\nPros;\n* THE ART IS SO CUTE\n* The story and music is charming\n* You get to draw whatever you want. If you want to save Barney the Purple Dinosaur as the Hamburgular, you can do that. If you want to wield a poorly-drawn Master Sword as Mario, you can also do that. Hell, if you wanted to play as a toilet, you can do that as well.\n\nPretty Minor Cons;\n* Story's extremely short. While the pacing's alright, there could have been an extra chapter to make it feel rewarding besides a completion bonus; people who don't like really short stories in video games should keep away.\n* Not very accurate point-and-click controls for combat? Not sure.\n* No eraser function besides undo.\n\nI rate it a 7/10; nice, but could be improved on for the third game.","February 27","true","4.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I played for like 30 minutes and i couldnt even get my guy done cause 1. when i was coloring the first one it stopped and wouldnt let me color 2. it had no eraser so I could either restart the whole thing, undo multiple times and lose color progress or just quit (like I did). So I do not recommend this game at all but that is your opinion.....","April 22","false","0.6"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
