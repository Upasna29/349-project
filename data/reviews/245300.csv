It performs well, has smooth controls, and I haven't encountered any bugs so far.  The game itself is a fun platformer with collectibles and puzzle-solving.  If you are playing by yourself, the AI for Oswald is good enough to get by no problem.  Lots of charming Disney songs, animations, and artwork!\n\nEDIT:  I beat the game today and I was able to finish the game without encountering any bugs other than Winslow getting stuck sometimes.  Overall a very fun platformer!","October 6, 2014","true","7.4"," 75 of 111 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","75","111","0","5"

Multi-core, specific resolutions and such.  And with less than an hour of runnng the game to say the least.\nIt runs just fine for me in 1080p on a 6-core processor.\n\nFor the simple platformer that it is,  I enjoy it. Someone mentioned Spyro as a comparison, and though it's not nearly as focused a game, I tend to agree.  It's got that classic Disney cartoon vibe to it which helps give it a warm feel.\n\nIf you go into it not expecting it to break new ground genre wise or simply not to be complete trash (your mind already being set), you're sure to enjoy it.","December 7, 2014","true","25.0"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

Not really challenging so far though but the animations, sound and voices feel like a Disney experience.

You might be fortunate enough to be able to actually finish the game, but be sure to test it first. If you have any crashes in the first hour or two you should expect the rest of the game to play that way (and potentially reach a point where you can't progress); if not, you're probably in the clear, but it's not a guarantee.\n\nThe most common offender is cutscenes, particularly the transition from the Underground to Mean Street North. Some are never able to move past that point, others can reload the game and move on. I was able to get through it, but whenever I attempted to use the camera item I immediately crashed to the desktop (even just staring at the ground, so it's not a weird issue with draw distance or loading lots of art and textures), and have since given up further attempts to make the game work.\n\nThe community hub is filled with similar reports, and these issues have never been resolved by the developer. There is a thread reporting some success by  limiting the number of cores in use  just to make the game work correctly, to give you an idea of what a poor port this is. On top of these problems, the controls feel clunky and this version of the game removed co-op, leaving you to deal with the occasionally frustrating and clumsy AI controlling Gus.\n\nIf you're able to look past the bugs and serious functionality issues, and not run into any sections that block progression, the game itself is an average platformer with lots of collectibles, but nothing particularly special. If you really want to play it you should stick to the console versions.","January 5","false","0.9"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

This game revives the classic cartoons as platforming stages and brings back old characters commonly left in the dust in Disney's media.\n\nThe gameplay is simple, fun, and is a "choose your own way" type of adventure, causing and choosing good or bad outcomes. Only a few bugs and small exploits are found but overall the gameplay is an interesting concept.\n\nThough one thing I truly admire and think what gives this game it's name is the level design. The level design is based on altered/combined versions of the Disney Parks attractions, both still operating and defunctional (Haunted Mansion or 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea), and turns them into a puzzling level. It shows appeal to both hardcore fans of the parks and people who just had a good time in the parks.\n\nThough I would say, plot wise and bug wise, the second one isn't as good as the first one, which is Wii exclusive, i'd give it a try to truly understand what this experience is along with the plot.","May 12, 2015","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I haven't had the chance to play the first game, but I heard good things about it and I was really hoping that Epic Mickey 2 will be a great 3D platformer, but it's far from it, especially on PC.\n\nThe first thing I noticed that the game feels clunky. It often feels like a game from the era when developers were still just experimenting with the idea of 3D in a platformer and often times those games just doesn't feel right. It's something like that here, quite often I couldn't tell wheter an item is behind me or in front of me and if so how far. It's hard to explain, but the 3D just doesn't feel right compared to other games. There are 2D levels as well, but those are mostly really short (and I DO mean really short, 1-3 minutes mostly...).\n\nThat's the least of my worries though with this game, there are much bigger ones as well sadly. The PC port is just bad. Both optimization/graphics and control-wise. Especially the latter, the controls are terrible with keyboard+mouse. I pretty much always prefer to play my games with kb+m, but I'd really recommend using a gamepad if you really want to play this game (which you shouldn't).\n\n...and lastly what really killed the game for me that it's basically a coop game that you can play alone as well and it just doesn't work well in solo. The AI is the worst I've seen since the late '90s. Oswald never does what you want him to do, never around when you need him and pretty much just runs around aimlessly while you wait for him so you can proceed with the game. I wouldn't even bother playing this alone to be honest, the AI pretty much killed all the fun.\n\nAll in all Epic Mickey 2 is the shoddy port of a mediocre game with terrible AI. It might be fun if you can get someone to play this with you (using controllers), otherwise skip this one, there are better platformers out there.","December 12, 2014","false","7.1"," 7 of 17 people (41%) found this review helpful","41","7","17","0","0"

Also, it feels like there aren't as many lands to explore as in the first one.\nI enjoyed the cheesy musical they made out of the story and tha ability to play with Oswald (though if you're not playing two-player you can't play as Oswald), but sometimes the AI can be frustrating when Oswald doesn't do what you want him too. The camera was not improved from the first game.\nIf you really want to play this game despite it's faults, you might have fun. I'm glad I played it and would play a third game, but I'm dissapointed that it doesn't hold up to the first game.","August 24, 2015","false","35.5"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Well maybe a slight.\n\nI looooooooved the concept this game brought out. The classics and the paintbrush made me so giddy! Nice work on combining the classic looks and 3D appeal. The game mechanics is very easy to learn and understand. Of course this is a kids game, so I certainly hope so!  I just love the sense of nostalgia it brings out.\n\nHowever, my strongest agitation from this game is the extreme hand holding. The moment Gus and Oswald joins Mickey, Gus will constantly almost every 5 seconds repeat the same hints. One of the simple beginning puzzle of getting out of the crumbling castly is paint a toon. I painted everything! Including the two npcs! I painted especially painted a figure that looked like a toon that needed a head. Figured Mickey was supposed to paint it back to life. Nope! It was Gus. The one toon that kept saying, "THERE HAS TO BE A TOON YOU CAN PAINT". ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. He was the first I attacked too since he is so obnoxious. Oswald was fun, but got super annoying pretty quick. The little guy kept getting in the way, takes too long catching up, and picky where to use certain actions like electrocute and jump.\n\nLast nail to it's coffin is the sounds. Now this is a very personal agitation, like allergies, so don't let this be the defining factor in not trying out this game. The game is cute and can be enjoyable if you can tolerate Gus's constant obvious advices. Anyways, I don't know why but some of the sounds, especially when you open the map and close it, gives me a headache. I tried to perservere, but I'd just get sick and turn off the game. When I tried to play it again the next day, I got nauseated much faster and yet again developed a minor headache. Third try didn't last more than 5 minutes unfortunatly. I hope nobody else has gone through the same issue. This isn't too terrible a game! Certainly not suitable for PC though >_>","December 17, 2014","false","2.3"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

Such as the keyboard controls. These controls are some of the most awful controls I've seen in a video game yet. That's why you should NOT pick up this game unless you have a Xbox 360/PS3 controller. Also, to just nitpick here, you can't go into full screen, which is very annoying on PC games. Now besides the port problems, this game has some extremely annoying characters such as Gus, the little green thing that wont ever shut up. He is constantly holding your hand through every little part of the game that may require you to think, which not only makes him an annoying character, but he also near ruins the game. That's another thing about this game: There is no challenge what so ever. The boss battles are the only thing that could be considered semi-challenging, and there are about 3 in the entire game, meaning the majority of the game is easy. Also, the game feels like DLC for Epic Mickey 1 more than anything, since it is so short. Really, you could probably beat the game in LESS THAN AN HOUR. Imagine purchasing a broken $60 game that only lasts 40 minutes. I'd be pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off. Other complaints I had where the voice acting. Now I suppose you could probably deal with it, but really, the acting is pretty bad in this game. As well as the musical segments. Yep, musical segments. This game was marketed as a musical game, but really there are about 5 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ songs in the entire game that are all sung by the same character. I wouldn't qualify this a musical. Now there are a few things I liked about the game. One of them being the boss battles. The battles brought in a change to the game, allowing you to choose how you defeat them: Turning them into a friendly,  or killing them. I though this was a great idea in Epic Mickey 1 and it is still a great idea in Epic Mickey 2. However, other games have done this practice MUCH better than Epic Mickey, because in this game, your choices don't really matter. If you pick the good choice, you are praised as a hero in the end. If you pick the bad choice, you are praised as a hero in the end. Though that doesn't really take away from the over all enjoyment of the fight. Another thing I liked was the enviroment. If you didn't know, the world is pretty much a destroyed Disneyland, however, the first game did this much better. On consoles this was an over all decent game, on PC however, it is a bad game. So if you want to play one of these games, GET THE THE FIRST ONE, or purchase this game on consoles. I still do recommend getting the first one, because it is a pretty good game, and it will help you understand this one better.\n\nConsoles: 3/5\nPC: 2/5\n\nNot recommended unless you are a fan of the original game, or if you are interested in Disney history.","December 7, 2014","false","13.0"," 2 of 11 people (18%) found this review helpful","18","2","11","0","0"

Granted it's not as good as the first Epic Mickey game, but it's still pretty good. Sadly though, there is no 2player mode so it might take a while to beat with CPU Oswald. But the game is also kinda short if you know what you're doing and the story isn't as good as the story in the first game. But at least there's voice acting! :D The only downside to the voice acting is that the Mad Doctor's lines are songs and he's constantly singing.\nI give this game a 7.8/10\nNot as good as the first Epic Mickey, but still good and is definitely worth a play. Especially if you're a hardcore Disney fan.\nBut I suggest playing the first game before playing Power of Two that way you understand the story of the second game and that way you also know who the heck Ortensia is and how Mickey already knows all these characters.\nBut yeah it's a great game and I recommend it.","December 4, 2015","true","18.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So much so that I kept feeling like I was missing stuff as I progressed through each level, such as different paths I could have taken to see where they lead or quests I just couldn't complete because I may have screwed something up in another part of the area.\n\nFor the most part I tried to stick with the hero path but I inadertantly caused more damage in a lot of areas than I meant to because I thought I was doing the right thing or defending myself.\n\nAnyhoo it was an enjoyable experience and perhaps I'll give it another go eventually to find all the secrets that I might have passed by.","March 19","true","9.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
