After around 30 minutes I've made it to level 12, clearing all the levels with 3 out of 3 stars. However, as you progress new game elements like moving buzz saws or other obstacles are being introduced. Getting all the stars becomes increasingly difficult and quickly turns this game into a reset simulator. That said, if you don't care about getting all the stars you can progress considerably faster.\n\nMidnight also features a short but beautiful, soothing piano track. I wish it wouldn't be interrupted everytime you reset a level, though.\n\nA few things to note:\n\nOn first launch the game tries to connect to Google servers for unknown reasons. If you value your privacy, just block the game in your firewall and you're good to go.\n\nThe game process keeps running after you quit, resulting in Steam assuming you're still in-game and increasing your play time. Not only does this mess with your Steam stats, but it also might become relevant in case you don't like the game and want to refund it. So make sure to terminate the process after exiting the game.\nAll in all, this game is perfect to be played whenever you want to chill, or kill some time.","February 6","true","2.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Fun?! Well, lets just say that it's frustrating as hell most of the time, but yeah, it's fun. You'll spend a lot of time trying to get that square, glowing, little B#%#@ in the hole...And swearing at that little bugger most of the time...Which in a way can be fun itself!\nThe graphics, great! Sound clean and crisp. Super LOVE the music and snow! (But the graphics with snow and music may be the only calming influences throughout the game!)\nRecommend this game?! Yes, highly. We're gamers and we LOVE a good challenge!\nBut I will add, now I know why golfer's brake their clubs in two!...Enjoy the game!","January 31","true","16.5"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","10","12","4","0"

Beautiful, clean graphics, relaxing piano music, and 56 entertaining puzzles - yup, this is one of the best games to just chill out and test your problem solving skills. I'll be honest I'm not usually a puzzle gamer, but the creators made an irresistable atmosphere to play in. It made me feel like sneaking out at night as a child and playing in a field or jungle gym. Despite my occasional outbursts of "Gaaaaaaaaaaahh!", I'm looking forward to beating all the levels and getting a perfect 3/3!","February 1","true","14.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I can get over the 16:9 fixation, since this is a 2D game and it needs a lot of work to make 21:9 supported. (Ori and the blind forest has this too, with a good reason.) I game on a 34" 3440x1440 (21:9) monitor and the jagged edges of the font and other graphics in game were really not pleasing on the eyes. First thing I did was go into the options which pretty much had nothing in there to actually make a difference to the game. There are only a few options total which adjust some ingame rendering settings.\n\nInterfaceHow the interface works is pretty counterintuitive. After finishing the level, there are only 2 options: one being Save and Continue and the other Save and Quit. The perfection guy in me wanted to retry the level since I only got 1 star, but there was no option.\nGoing with the Save and Continue option (since I don't want to quit the game), I ended up in the next level, which I didn't want to! I expected to get to the level selection. Immediately I pressed Esc to get back to the menu, but it didn't do anything. I found myself going through every button on my keyboard to find out how to get some kind of menu with options. Eventually Q got me out to the level selection. Soon I found out that R is for restart.\n(Note: a few levels farther, I think level 5, there were some instructions for Q and R. Which is pretty late.)\n\nExit bugExiting the game is not working correctly on my machine (Win10), the process keeps running and Steam keeps saying I'm still ingame. Leaving me with no other option than to manually kill the process.\n\nGameplayGameplay is exactly as shown, it's fun to spend some time. It plays like Angry Birds and other games alike. I like the dark setting and the art on the background, the lightbeams and shadows look fun and move really smooth. However, again really jagged edges/pixellated.\n\nSoundThen onto the sound, at first I thought, nice piano. But it got unbelievably repetitive even in the short time I played through multiple levels. Some sound effects seem really simple and a bit off. (Like the very loud piano bash when you hit a "monster" or fly off screen.)\n\nConclusionI like the actual gameplay, good to make time pass. However, in my opinion, too immature development wise. It needs a lot of polishing for me to become a playable game. There are too many things that are quite frustrating and annoying that completely pull my focus away from the actual game.\nI hope there will be some updates in the future.","February 6","false","0.4"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","4","8","0","0"

I would like the ability to retry levels.  Mostly though it just seems too simple for a PC game.  It would be a good mobile game or maybe a browser game.  ALso not a fan of the fact that the game never stops running when you try to quit it.","February 10","false","3.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

I've tried launching the game over 20 times now since I bought it this past Thursday, (the 18th). I've emailed Petite games and all of there "solutions" were s h i t. Like try running the game from Steam, try running the game from the Steam folder in your computer, try uninstalling it and reinstalling it, etc. They haven't done anything really. I think I'm just going to ask for a refund. Just thought I'd let people know.","February 21","false","0.2"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/poolkris/recommended/431460/","poolkris","kris.saether","http://steamcommunity.com/id/poolkris/","193 products in account","Midnight is a simple but well polished game, by an independent developer, and it doesn't cost much for a couple of hours' casual play. I personally like to try to support indie games, which are usually labours of love and don't set out just to make money, although I'm sure the successful ones don't mind that!\n\nThis game has solid physics and clean graphics, and a nice relaxing soundtrack. The puzzles aren't too hard, like it says on the Store Page it's basically just like a golf game, although it might test your patience to try to get all levels done in the least amount of shots possible (for the three-star score each time). Nobody is going to go through the game perfectly first-time but one nice feature of the game is that if you fail or feel like you've taken too many shots, it is very quick and easy to restart the level and try again.\n\nIt would be nice to see achievements to motivate you a bit more to complete the game fully, but it's just a bit of casual fun, you shouldn't expect anything more from it. Recommended here.","February 6","true","4.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has a nice looking, slowly animated background with optional background snow. The contrast between the dark and light, give it kind of an artsy feel, and the music matches up very well. The game runs just fine on my 10 year old laptop.\n\nA very minor issues for me - the play speed I get is not even near half as fast as the video shows it being.\n\nAll in all, a very enjoyable game. Definitely recommended if you like these sort of games.","February 28","true","7.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
