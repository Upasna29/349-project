At the time of writing this review, I have had zero hours played of this game IN STEAM. While I have not played this game through steam, I have played through it at least five times in the past straight from the disk. I can say without a doubt that this is my favorite point and click game. Not only is it simple, but it has a compelling story, some very creepy elements, and is overall a well thought out, and well balanced horror game.\n\nFirst of all, the story of this game is very immersive. It really puts you into the protagonist's shoes and makes you want him to progress and find whatever it is that he needs to find. (Trying to avoid any and all spoilers in this) This tactic of turning you into the protagonist really compells you to progress in the game.\n\nA good point to also make is that the characters in this game are all VERY diverse. There are a wide range of individuals in this game, and they are truly individuals. They have their own voice, action set, and personality. This makes the game seem realistic no matter how crazy it all seems.\n\nTrue Horror. This game isn't a new game, obviously. It is before all of this jump scare nonsense. A lot of people can't stand them, and I am one of them. Instead of throwing things at your face, his game uses it's storyline while constantly and consistently sprinkling creepy people, places, and ideas to get under your skin and really make your heart pump.\n\nThe music in this game is very good in my opinion. It adds a lot of subtle creepy tones to the game that couldn't be attained with such a magnificent soundtrack.\n\nYou may see point and click and think "Too easy. I would be done in minutes." This isn't the speedrun kind of game. It actually has given me some difficulty. The game really makes you think about what needs to be done next.\n\nPuzzles, puzzles, puzzles! This game has many uniquely puzzling puzzles. It has just enough to make your brain work without bringing you out of the game's atmosphere.\n\n\nOverall, I think this game is very well worth the five dollars that I payed for it on sale even though I know the story by heart and all the places to click are stored in my brain. I honestly can't think of anything negative to say about this game. I have loved it for years upon years and I will keep loving it as the simple, yet eerie and enjoyable game that will stay in my heart forever.\n\nTL:DR:\n\nWell structured game.\nGood cheap horror title.\nGreat character development.\nPerfect music.\nChallenging.\nGreat puzzles.\n\nAnd creepy as all hell!\n\nThank you for reading. I really suggest this game to anyone looking for horror, point and click, casual, adventure, or creep-me-out kind of games. The developers from the past really deserve a pat on the back for this masterpiece.\n\n\nEDIT: It was requested that I speak more specifically about the story in my review. Hopefully this helps some of you.\n\nIn this game, you wake up in an insane asylum after a tragic car accident. You have amnesia and can not remember your name, why you are there, or many details about your own life and the world around you. You explore different planes of reality and even fantasy to learn the details of your life and why you woke up in the asylum.\n\nI suppose this summary kind of dumbs down the amazingly integrated and intruiging plot of the game, but don't let my horrible preview fool you. The story may seem unrelatable and maybe even boring to some of you, (Trying to figure out your past, present, and future) but once you begin to play this game, you will instantly feel otherwise. I hope this bit helps some of you decide on purchasing this game.","October 29, 2014","true","3.9"," 268 of 288 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","268","288","2","4"

One of the most immersive point & click adventure games ever released, Sanitarium offers an extremely thick atmosphere, excellently voiced dialogue and a plot that will keep anyone who appreciates a good, abstract story on the edge of their seats.\n\nIn Sanitarium you play the role of a patient, bound in rags with no immediate recollection of who or where he is but soon finds himself in a very twisted and obscure world, far different to our own in which he must converse with interesting characters, seek answers to riddles and solve puzzles in hopes of finding an answer to the madness which surrounds him.\n\nNot much can be said about Sanitarium without taking away from this unique experience other than it’s an extremely solid point & click adventure game for both hardcore and newcomers to the genre and one of the most memorable experiences in all my years of gaming.\n\nThis Steam version works well, my only current complaint, as far as my knowledge, being that you cannot choose the aspect ratio but other than that everything is intact here! Very interesting game that I could easily recommend to people that have never played anything from the genre.","October 29, 2014","true","38.7"," 106 of 117 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","106","117","0","1"

After what seems like an eternity, Sanitarium is finally on Steam. Currently, I have the CD (3 discs + insert) sitting right next to me, and the GOG version installed and bookmarked through my library (not anymore).\n\nI used to play this game several times a week, just because it was so engrossing. When this game released, it came at time when Point-and-Clicks were fading out (post-LucasArts and Sierra), so it became somewhat of a cult game.\n\nThis is one of my all time favorite games, providing an eclectic variety of atmospheres, horrors, and oddities. Between the isometric view, diverse scenes, the ominous soundtrack, clever puzzles, and amazing storyline, Sanitarium has always stood out.  I most definitely recommend this game.\n\n"Youth hides the key to Salvation."","October 29, 2014","true","8.8"," 61 of 68 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","61","68","0","1"

The story is quite engaging: our protagonist has a car accident after which he wakes up in an asylum. He does not know how he got there nor does he remember what happened to him (let alone his name).\n\nIf you look at the pictures on the store page you can clearly see not every event takes place in reality - our hero goes through various environments impersonating different persons throughout different ages (or planes, if you will). It makes the story a bit convoluted but eventually you will get all pieces of the puzzle together.\n\nOh, puzzles! Normally, you have a couple of items in your inventory and making a progress is fairly easy but from time to time you need to solve puzzles. These require some finesse and you do not get the help you would in today's games.\n\nSanitarium is a good game but aged much throughout the years. Since the story is still interesting and some of the artwork looks haunting (the game gradually gets under your skin without having any jump scares) I can recommend it not just to those people who used to own this game but also to those who loved the genre back in the '90s.\n\nPS: I played it upon its release when it crashed frequently. An update not long ago was applied which seems to have eliminated all the CTDs completely.","April 12, 2015","true","10.5"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","26","28","2","0"

And since then, I have been speaking about this game as one of a kind, ahead of its time whether it be the graphics or the storyline. Like me, I am quite certain a number of gamers would title this game as one of the milestones in their gaming history.\n\nThe graphics of the game might not be as enticing as some of the games that are available in these days. Even if the general atmosphere of the game is horror, do not expect to be "scared", however, you might find yourself very disturbed while playing it. The game uses many cliché horror elements successfully.\n\nThe puzzles are very cleverly designed yet not too obvious nor too hard. The general story takes the player from an asylum to an abandoned bizarre village without any adults but only populated by deformed children, from a spin at a run-down circus to the pages of a sci-fi comic book until finalizing in an Aztec Temple. Regardless of how surreal the plot-line may seem, the ending is quite rational explaining it all.\n\nThis game has been one of my favourite games to this day, and I am quite certain hands down its story-line still will be one of the most intellectually written computer game stories, past and future.\n\nThere are sadly some downsides for the gaming equipment of today - the game crashes if the subtitles are enabled in the cinematics, and movement is not very precise compared to the modern day games. Apart from these two minor but very tolerable downsides this game is a must-have for any point&click and story rich adventure gamer.","November 2, 2014","true","11.2"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

The player must find his path while travelling in the real world, the world of his mind or in-between. All that, while interacting with other npc's or solving puzzles.\nThe eerie atmosphere (plus the ost), the dark scenario and the fact that this game released back in '97 ,or so, makes this game unique, or even better one of the best point & click horror/mystery games of all times.","October 29, 2014","true","0.3"," 32 of 40 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","32","40","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/5NATCH/recommended/284050/","5NATCH","mmm!5NATCH","http://steamcommunity.com/id/5NATCH/","513 products in account","Sanitarium is a beautifully dark and surreal point and click adventure game with a great story line.\n\nUse your mouse to click where to take your character, interact with objects or talk with people.  The music locks in so well with every setting you visit and be prepared for some some odd and strange visuals along the way. You'll encounter some puzzles which range from different difficulties, Some may be too easy and some may be rather cryptic leaving you crawling for a walk thru online somewhere. But along its unique environments, freaky music and unsettling atmosphere the story is constructed well, You'll begin with very little and most likely a lot of confusion but as you play onward, bit by bit the pieces come together and you'll be curious to learn more as you venture further more.\n\nThe only down parts I would mention would be the voice acting can be a little bit silly, There are many characters to interact with (I think there's an achievement for talking to all of them but I didn't get it) and most of them scattered amongst the levels will just repeat the same content as many other characters in the level you are in. While it's not the exact same dialog, It'll leave you a tad frustrated because you've heard it nearly 5 times before and you get to the point of reading the subtitles faster than they've finished speaking their first sentence.  Also, the walking controls can sometimes get stuck, walking is often quite slow and since you have to travel back and forth on most levels, it can feel like a drag or an effort to move around.\n\nSanitarium should be welcomed by the modern gamer for its different style of gameplay that has somewhat gone a bit quiet these days. There's some 'Random' games out there but nothing like the twisted and weird games which only the famous retro games on MS-dos and PC back in the day delivered. It's well admired from the retro gamers world wide and now, maybe its time for you to hook it up and indulge in a classic world with the nostalgia style of game play that entertained many of years","May 27, 2015","true","9.8"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","19","20","0","0"

Although rough-looking for a game in 2014/2015, Sanitarium more than makes up for it with its well written AND spoken dialogue, story that is rivaled by few in the genre, and the atmosphere is absolutely perfect.\n\nBut before I begin to praise Sanitarium even more, I must warn you of one thing that the game really fails at -- its controls. More specifically, the movement of the main character. You move at a crawl and you really have to shove your mouse with some authority to get the direction you want. In fact, some parts of the game have you crawling around (of course not literally, you're walking) for several minutes if you have to backtrack, which will happen on your first playthrough. I can understand the slow movement may be annoying for people who are used to modern games where characters often have the ability to run around, but not in this game. You're going to have to walk around and backtrack. Sorry.\n\nAnyways, now that the bad is out of the way, a quick list of pros.\n- Great horror atmosphere. The ambiance, chillingly good voice acting of some characters, the music, the details in areas you'll explore. Good stuff here.\n- Extremely captivating story. If by the 2nd chapter you're getting bored I'd be surprised.\n- As the steam description says, "...this timeless point-and-click horror game is a must-have for adventure game fans."\nCouldn't have put it better myself.\n\nIn short, if you like point-and-click horror adventure games and don't mind a character that moves around a little bit slow, then this game is definitely for you.","October 31, 2014","true","1.6"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","18","20","0","0"

Building entire psychotic worlds over the depressing backdrop, Sanitarium manages to tap into the grotesque, eccentric and sometimes funny subconscious of its protagonist, Max, without losing focus of the meta narrative. It is a rare example of elaborate storytelling that I would argue transcends the video gaming medium and becomes what some refer to as high art. While not particularly long and as linear as a film, Sanitarium delivers the sort of single-serving experience that captures its audience while insanity takes over and the worlds you visit meld into a carnival of metaphors. The puzzles are easy enough to give the plot pacing while the overarching themes give your bandage-faced hero a sense of mental consistence, in spite of all the craziness.\n\nBUY IT if you:\n-Collect classic gems.\n-Do not know what a 586 is, but love stuff like Jacob's Ladder and Shutter Island.\n-Do not feel deterred by isometric 1998 graphics when looking for your mystery fix.\n\nDO NOT BUY IT if you:\n-Expect a great deal of gaming hours out of the money you spend on games.\n-Are neither nostalgic nor curious about oldies but goldies in the realm of adventure gaming.\n-Demand difficult puzzles and think anything less than The Dig is a waste of your analythical brilliance.","November 8, 2014","true","7.9"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rottin/recommended/284050/","rottin","Rottin","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rottin/","883 products in account","TL;DR: BUY THIS GAME, ONE OF THE BEST HORROR ADVENTURES EVER!\n\nLonger version:\n\nThis game is cult classic, ironically not known by many gamers. I remember demo that I played in 1998, which was first episode in asylum tower, after fifteen minutes I knew I had to own this game, so I bought it.\n\nBack then everything about Sanitarium was simply flawless, locations were beautyful in the eerie, horrific way, voice acting- perfect, sounds and music-unique and integrated with rest of the game, animation and most of all the movies. Oh my god, the movies! They were fantastic back in the day, they were so ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ good it wasn't even strange that developers decided to put an option of replaying already watched parts in the main menu.\n\nBut enough about technical aspects, since they aged (but with  dignity, they're not hurting my eyes today). Sanitarium begins with a man talking via phone on his way to car. He's excited that he finally discovered something, and tells person on the other end of the line, that he will tell all when he'll get back home. So he drives, but becaeuse of his anxiety drives too fast and on the turn car flip out of the road. Next thing you know your (because thats you, main character) face is covered with bandages, you, dont remember anything except accident, including your name, and you wake up in urine soaked cell in some god abandoned asylum. In next few minutes you'll visit administration room, where you'll learn, that wolrd remeber your accident differently than you. From that moment everything is only turning to worse and worse nightmare that will make you clueless for the most part of the game.\n\nStory of the game is great and is brilliantly executed, creating many plots, black holes, situations and dialogs that at first appears to be pointless or simply insane, just to finally be small part of bigger picture, that is giving them sence and makes them suddenly extremely important in process of understanding plot.\n\nThat's when we come to great thing about Sanitarium, that is really uncommon in adventure games - replayability. Of course, puzles remains the same, BUT when we finish the game for the first time we have knowledge of what really happened, and suddenly there are TONS of content that we ignored in first run, because it seemed irrelevant. Know it fits, it adds another brick to the big picture.\n\nHorror aspect of game is briliantly build. It's not survival horror, you don't really have to worry about your character getting killed, so monsters jumping from corners wouldnt fit here. Game is buinding whole atmosphere on feeling that you are lost, and very possibly insane, that you are fighting just to acknowledge simple truth- that you are as mad as everyone is telling you. Game is not afraid of gore, or disturbing images, which fits perfectly to graphic desing of Sanitarium.\n\nGame contains 9 chapters (each is +- 2 hours long) and besides being part of the whole plot each of them is telling it's own story, mostly very sad and disturbing, some may be liked less, because every single one of them is based on different theme (I didnt'd liked The Hive as much as others) but each is small gem. The Innonent Abandoned and Circus Of Fools  are so brilliant that they deserve they own reviews.\n\nUnveiling plot of chapters and the game leaves a player with strage and uneasy feeling, like Silent Hill2 few years later. You know its great, and you wish you could witness it again for the first time, and in the same moment you know that everything about it is depressing.\n\nAnd just like Silnet Hill2, Sanitarium is pure gold. For me this game is worth 10/10, poudly standing on the first place on podium for the title of best horror advetunre game ever, ex aequo.\n\nBuy this game, worth so much more than few bucks. But they could fix problem with subtitles in the movies (they crash the game, don't turn them on)","November 3, 2014","true","6.7"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/284050/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1599 products in account","Sanitarium is an old school cult classic point and click adventure title from 1998. You play as the main protagonist, Max, who wakes up in an insane asylum with amnesia; he doesn't even remember his own name, how he ended up in the asylum, or any events surrounding his life. It is up to you, the player, to put the pieces of the story together through cutscenes and dialogue.\n\nThe main thing that Sanitarium accomplishes is giving the player an overwhelming sense of confusion at the beginning, which places players into the mindset of Max, and gives way to the emotions that he may experience due to his amnesia. The confusion slowly deteriorates throughout the course of the 13 levels as more information is obtained. It's easy to become immersed in the experience of the title, as there is absolutely no foreshadowing of events or dramatic irony present. This leaves it up to the player to continually think about what is happening from moment to moment, until the next piece of the story is revealed. In order to fully understand what is going on by the end of the game, it's extremely important to interact and talk with the other characters that will be available in each level. Unlike many other games of this nature that may leave loose ends once the game is finished, Sanitarium does a good job of cleaning them all up so that the player has solid knowledge of what really has transpired.\n\nThe port itself is exceptional, as it performs just as the original did back in 1998. There are no crashes, glitches, bugs, or lag present, and absolutely nothing that renders the game unplayable. The cinematics still have their scan-lines, which really brings out the old CRT vibe of the game. One weird thing that I did encounter is that the game does run at 15-17 FPS, but the puzzles render at 60 FPS. You can tell how much more smooth the puzzle sections are versus the rest of the game, but back in 1998 it was standard for isometric PC titles to run at 15 FPS; I'm just unsure as to why the puzzle sections have a higher output. Either way, we can thank DotEmu for another fantastic port of an underdog retro title.\n\nThe gameplay itself is simple enough, the right mouse button is held down to make the character walk and the left mouse button is used to interact with people and objects. Sometimes the walking mechanic can be mildly irritating if you're attempting to maneuver around stairs; quite often you may end up descending and ascending the same staircase by accident. Every single piece of dialogue is coupled with a voice-over, including the buttons in the main menu and the items in the player's inventory; I must say, for a game made in 98' the voice acting is superb, as are the various voice effects on creatures such as insectoids and specters.\n\nThe maps are quite small, and while some may push that this was a limitation of late 90's technology, I will point out here that Diablo was released in late 1996. While the original Diablo did not exactly have monstrous maps by any means, they were at least 3-4 times larger than any given map present within Sanitarium. This doesn't really set the game back, however, as each of the 13 levels have their own distinct map; each of which are radically diverse from one another. The visuals stand up to the test of time, and are as outstanding as they are gory. The music and sound effects are equally as captivating, and they really help to submerge the gamer into the realm of the title.\n\nSo in wrap-up, Sanitarium is an excellent cult classic from 1998 that has stood the test of time. The game has received a flawless port by DotEmu, and it's worth a pick up to fans of old point and click adventure isometrics. To those on the fence, if you've played current generation games such as Stasis and Primordial, and have enjoyed them, then Sanitarium should be a hit with you as well. While I don't believe that $10.99 CAD is too steep for this title, on sale for $5.50 is even better. If you're using a guide, the title shouldn't run more than 7-9 hours.\n\nRating: 5.0/5.0 - An amazing achievement, this game must be played.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","February 8","true","8.4"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/284050/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","Sanitarium always struck me as one of the unsung classics of the adventure genre. Releasing originally in 1998, it came right before a significant lull in point and click games. It's hard to say if it would have garnered more or less attention had it come out during one of the prime periods, since it does a lot of things right, but still suffers from many of the flaws that hampered its contemporaries.\n\nThe game opens with you as an amnesiac named Max, terribly scarred and confused, locked up in the least feasible insane asylum imaginable. Seriously, Arkham has nothing on this place; one of your first tasks is to engineer yourself across a Death Star Tractor Control-style chasm to a guard office suspended above the abyss, all while the oddly medieval tower crumbles around you. It only gets stranger from there as Max is whisked away to towns of zombie children, a circus on an island beset by man-eating squid, and a living hive of human-sized bugs that's even more bizarre than whatever you're imagining.\n\nThe real strength of Sanitarium is in its settings, the dark, impossible worlds that each of its thirteen chapters take place in. They are wholly unique and dreamlike, perfectly capturing that backdrop of madness in the same way that Planescape: Torment captured life in an utterly alien city. The graphics are actually quite similar, both employing those early 3D models transposed into animated sprites. The worlds of Sanitarium are not overly large, so the graphics benefit from some excellent detail and extra animations for almost any situation.\n\nThere are plenty of NPCs to interact with, each with a unique and adequately voiced personality. Puzzles tend to be pretty clear for the most part, and the game doesn't bog you down with a sprawling inventory like some of its peers. You may run into a few walkthrough situations in the more alien settings, but in general the game does a good job of communicating what you should be doing and how to go about it. Unfortunately, it make take you some time to get it done because your walk speed is on the very low end of tolerable and there's no sprinting or fast travel. The adequate voice work can also drone on for far longer than is welcome, though spoken dialog can be skipped through in favor of the ever-present text.\n\nStory-wise, Sanitarium is almost as much of a fever dream as the presentation. Max clearly has mental issues that are revealed symbolically through the many worlds of the game, but there's a much grander plot at work that reaches farther than most adventure games dare. It's a bit brazen and corny at times, but also woven into the symbolism in some pretty interesting ways. The whole journey is worth seeing through, and as long as you have some patience for slow trudging, overdone VOs, and a few obnoxious pixel hunts, I have no doubt Sanitarium will prove why it deserves to stand among the adventure classics.","October 29, 2015","true","6.8"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

I hadn't played this game for years, all a sudden it popped into my mind this morning, and I began to google old school reviews on it. The next thing I do is visit the Steam front page, and what do I find as a new seller? Sanitarium. If that doesn't call me to purchase this game, I don't know what the hell else can.\n\n\n\nFor those looking for a trippy adventure title, look no further.\n\nThe game came out late 90s but I picked it up early 2000 and played it on one of my first PC's I owned. Was quite an experience to say the least.\n\n\n\nI remember staying home from school sick with a bad cold due to allergies, popping some drowsy medicine, and playing Sanitarium.\n\nI think the meds helped enhance the overall atmosphere of the game because it was impossible for me to put down. Even as sleepy and tired as I was, I kept chugging away at this game throughout my sick day off and neared completion.\n\nThe game has you playing a man who is basically out of his mind. Not sure what is real and what isn't and you are basically playing what's in his head, good and bad.\n\nI don't want to get into the story or spoilers, but I'll leave it that I think the 2nd chapter stood out as one of my favorites because of all the creepy children and the overall environment. The game has an awesome atmosphere that doesn't let up.\n\nSure this game is old, but it's still a gem and now on Steam, I highly recommend picking it up. I own the original discs still and liked to add this to my Steam collection so I got it here as well.\n","November 2, 2014","true","6.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

Sanitarium is an adventure game from 1998. While it isn't a full blown horror game, it does have horror elements in it. If you are even slightly interested in buying this game, then buy it.\n\nSanitarium is not a convential point and click game, because the movement of your character is controlled by holding down the right mouse button and pointing where you want to move. It can get annoying quickly because your character moves SO SLOWLY, but this game wasn't made to be played at a fast pace. There's a lot to explore, and see in this game. There are some interesing characters in the story, with some average-to-bad voice acting, but that's to be expected from an old game. The graphics have gotten a slight bit better with the inclusion of 1080p (there's black bars on the sides, and steam overlay works). The gameplay, however, is the shining star. This is up there with some of the Adventure genre's finest games. The game is not too difficult so you can play it, and there are some smart puzzles laced into the game as you go. The settings are also really nice, with every chapter bringing you to a different location. There's towns inhabited by children, carnivals, mental instiutions, and mad scientist labs. Everything in this game is a joy to discover. The story is also really interesting, which involves you trying to regain your memory after a car crash. It might seem cliche, but this game will take you down some strange paths.\n\nIf you consider yourself an adventure game fan, then this is a must play. It's got every thing it needs to be an essential adventure game. Also, if you like horror games, check this out. It is sometimes unnerving and disturbing, which carries out through the entire game. Plus, with the 1080p support, and Steam achievements, you can't really go wrong with Sanitarium.\n\n","November 2, 2014","true","0.5"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

I loved watching people do video walkthroughs of it over and over and I finally got it and finished it!\n\nSo here it is folks, my review of Sanitarium.\n\nSTORY: You play as an amnesia stricken patient in an insane asylum dealing with the various psychologial issues he has.\n\nAs you go through various crazy levels such as a town where theres nothing but mutated children and overgrown plants, an island circus, and an alien world filled bugs, cybernetics, and cyclops, you will know more about the character you're playing and it smoothly helps the game along.\n\nFor me I thought the story was very excellent. The levels help correspond and relate to the characters memorys/issues and it works well. The only issue I have is the voice actors are okay/below average at best. 8.5/10\n\nGRAPHICS: Now of course I'm gonna get this out of the way. This game came out in the late 90's, of course the graphics are gonna be dated.\n\nOther than that I will say though that the game looks nice for its time and it didn't really bother me that much. 8/10\n\nGAMEPLAY: This is an isometric click and point adventure game. Some puzzles in my honest opinion kinda sucked, some were a bit too easy and others were in the right amount of difficulty for me.\n\nThere are 13 levels to go through and depending on how good you are at puzzles this game will probably only take you a few hours to beat unfortuantley.\n\nFor the average adventure gamer I would say this game will probably take you longer.\n\nAlso SLOW MOVEMENT. 7.5/10\n\nVERDICT: Sanitarium is a nice psychological horror game.\n\nGranted its not gonna spook you to death, but it brings in a great story, nostalgic graphics and fine gameplay.\n\nJust remember though its dated okay?;D 8/10","March 29","true","6.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You play as a man who has lost his mind and his memory and must journey through his own madness to discover the truth.\nThe controls are very simple (you only ever use the left and right mouse buttons) and the puzzles vary in difficulty. Some are straightforward visual puzzles whereas others require you to memorize information. There are some sequences that require you to fight off monsters, as well. I would say the story is the main reason I love this game, though. It's fun to play the first time to discover the truth, and just as fun to play a second time around so you can notice bits of foreshadowing and the ways in which the main character's delusions reflect reality.\nThe entire game can be beaten in one sitting. I finished every achievement in about 7 hours, but I played the game previously in middle school and still remembered a lot of the puzzle solutions. If you're starting from scratch, I imagine it will take longer. Either way, it is most definitely worth the $10 price tag.\nMy primary complaint about this game would be that sometimes the ultra-simple controls backfire and make things a bit difficult to manage. True to form of 90s PC games, there is a lot of clicking you will have to do on seemingly irrelevant objects in order to find, for instance, items required to move forward. I often found myself wishing I could move using arrow keys or WASD. There are also places where you can get stuck, so I recommend making a separate save at the beginning of each level just in case you need to go back (this also helps with getting the rarer achievements, or just for the fun of playing your favorite levels again).\nThe bottom line is: if you like creepy things and like to figure out mysteries, this is the next game you should buy. You will love it.","January 14, 2015","true","7.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As he learns more about his situation and remembers more about himself, his sanity comes further and further into question.\n\nWhile Sanitarium is filled with intriguing puzzles and memorable characters, its surreal mood and well-written story are the real draws.  The game is packed full of foreshadowing and symbolism that won't register on the first playthrough.  The bizarre occurrences can be explained once you know the whole story, and when our hero triumphs in the end, the player will feel very satisfied.  The levels combine realistic elements with incredible fantastic notions in a creepy crescendo of madness, putting the player increasingly on edge until the final truth is revealed.\n\nAdmittedly, since its creation in 1998, parts of Sanitarium have not aged well.  The cutscenes in particular will underwhelm today's audience.  One might also criticize the game's rather slow pacing and occasionally ridiculous voice acting.  At the end of the day, however, these elements merely add a level of nostalgic charm.\n\nIn short, Sanitarium is well worth playing at least twice - more, for the twisted levels and puzzles that you particularly enjoy.  It brings some of the best material that old-school point-and-click adventure games have to offer, and remains an excellent example of video games as art and entertainment both.","February 27, 2015","true","4.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The 90's really astound me. With the limited technology they had, they created such masterpieces. Sanitarium is a point-and-click genre game in which you control a wrapped-up mental patient, who is, and is not, mad. It's up to you to find out, if you can.\n\nI won't lie. Some puzzles are very hard to solve and I needed to consult a walkthrough. But I think it's partly my fault because pay REAL close attention to what they're saying because they do hint things. And if you're the nost type horay for you because you should click every single thing you can see and hear what he has to say.\n\nThe story and the designs!! God the designs. They say Silent Hill is the forefather of psychological horror like Resident was to survival horror, but no one mentions this gem. The subliminal designs, meanings and purpose in each of the situations you delve into is just mind-blowingly genius for its time. Graphics are great for its time and still looks great when brought forward now. The voice-acting was average on some, absolutely brilliant and haunting on the others. The story and boldly horrifying things that they dare to show are simply perfect. The only thing I would complain about is the controls. They are a wee bit clunky but it's the speed of the characters walking sometimes throughout a large map that gets me nodding off to sleep sometimes. Another thing is the cutscenes, where I think they could be added to just produce a more satisfying effect. Like the ending of The Hive.\n\nYou will want the character to proceed. You will want to help him find what he is seeking to find. You will emphathize with him. It's how immersive this is.\n\nVerdict? Astounding. Such classic.

Play with you. The idea of the game from begining is like having you to sort out conclusions of what happens -or it happens- with the protagonist. Most of the ambience or 'worlds' are amazing, also the most of the melodies in it. It also makes you think a lot for the many puzzles it has. So, it's not recommended if you don't have enough patience to resolve some of them, though is something minor in comparison with the rest.\n\nIn my opinion one of the most important things in the game is the story behind. The story in general and the little stories from the worlds. It's so entertaining to try to put together pieces of the different stories to know the main story completely. xD\n\nBut, in resume, it's high recommended!<3\nRemember! 2d old games can also be great & very interesting, too. ;)","February 14","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But, technology has really dated this one. The movement of the character was clumsy, the graphics are grainy, and the sound effects are annoying. The biggest drawback is the TERRIBLE VOICE ACTING - could be some of the worst I have ever heard!!!! Even still the story alone makes you want to finish this one. It is just as intriguing today as it was in 1998. If any game is worthy of a reboot, this one would be in my top 10. Would love to see this updated for today's audience.","February 23","true","19.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Play with you. The idea of the game from begining is like having you to sort out conclusions of what happens -or it happens- with the protagonist. Most of the ambience or 'worlds' are amazing, also the most of the melodies in it. It also makes you think a lot for the many puzzles it has. So, it's not recommended if you don't have enough patience to resolve some of them, though is something minor in comparison with the rest.\n\nIn my opinion one of the most important things in the game is the story behind. The story in general and the little stories from the worlds. It's so entertaining to try to put together pieces of the different stories to know the main story completely. xD\n\nBut, in resume, it's high recommended!<3\nRemember! 2d old games can also be great & very interesting, too. ;)","February 14","true","13.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Great puzzles and surreal atmosphere this game is a must for those who love point and click adventures games. But aside from that the game does suffer some issues. Putting asides suck minor things like dated graphics/controls (this was the late 90s) this game suffers from some optimization issues(cut scenes skipping and one game breaking bug in chapter 3 unless you go online and follow a guide) which is to be expected but the game also suffers from an underwhelming ending and clunky/unneccessary combat sequences. On a scale of 10 this deserves an 8, good enough to be remembered as the classic it is considered but still with a enough issues to remind you why most might not remember this game fondly.","March 19","true","12.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It has a deep and chilling story that completely engrosses you. By far the best aspect Sanitarium is its creepyness. The visuals and music are so unsettling. The puzzles are just the right amount of challenging.\n\nJust remember to save often. It is very crashy.","June 15, 2015","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
