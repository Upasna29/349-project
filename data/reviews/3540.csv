"http://steamcommunity.com/id/AGolfClub/recommended/3540/","AGolfClub","A Golf Club","http://steamcommunity.com/id/AGolfClub/","552 products in account","Bound by an evil spirit residing in the atmosphere of an arcade game, 10 animals develop ulterior motives for helping the witty protagonist along his broken path, but end up looking deeper, into themselves, and finding how they want to be by causing the obstacles in their path to no longer exist, which is what you might want to make happen to whichever one is the cheesiest (This is a no spoiler review, don't worry.) To give you a hint at what I'm talking about, let me explain the beginning of the game. First, you meet Bjorn. He wants to be acknowledged as a scholar, but struggles because of his terrible name. This leads him to search in his innermost thoughts which are strangely filled with pegs, and discover that with the name Bjorn, he wonders if his parents ever loved him. Through the tragic tale, you realize that pegs are what cause all problems in life, but that without them, you would have no life to live. In a beautiful world, you may even have tears in your eyes as you journey on. Along comes Bjorn's associate, Jimmy Lightning. He loved adrenaline, but still remains fat because his addiction has become too extreme and poor Jimmy has had to resort to "chemicals." You now enter his mind, and while it is filled with chemicals, the game brings along plenty of gameplay twists to keep it interesting. As you uncover the truth, Jimmy remembers that he also had a burning passion to play the guitar, and decided to dedicate a riff to playing every time you do something really really good. The riff is so awesome that it is the only one he will ever play for you, but you can ask anyone, it IS that awesome. Now, Jimmy also remembers that his real problem, all along, was that he was just really, really, really stupid. It's so hard not to reveal anything, but let me just say that Jimmy ends up talking about electricity, wanting to become a mad scientist, which Bjorn approves of probably because he wants to use it for vengence-driven tasks, but as of right now that is all speculation, as part of the beauty and artistry of this masterpiece is that you are left to figure out the meaning behind some things,. It's all in the experience. The issue arrives in that Jimmy is really, really, really stupid, and this prevents him from making any relavant or accurate statement. How will Jimmy reinvent himself? Will Bjorn ever come to peace with all of those who have wronged him? Find out all of this and more in Peggle, which is such an inspirational, touching, relatable experience for all.\n\nTraditional rating:\n"TWO F***ING PIXELS AWAY FROM HITTING THAT LAST F***ING RED PEG"/10\n\nOn a personal level, this game means much more than even this review could express. Please, please buy this game. Support the amazing philosophers who went above and beyond the definition of a "game." You could not possibly regret it.","January 10, 2014","true","5.8"," 39 of 44 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","39","44","4","1"

If you're not familiar with the franchise, Peggle is about shooting a limited number of marble at the orange pegs in a screen to try to clear them out. All the characters have special powers granted by hitting the green pegs. It's fun, simple, extremely approachable. If you like it, check the original (Peggle Deluxe) and the free Peggle Extreme which uses imagery from Valve's Orange Box.","January 23, 2015","true","4.4"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Ridiculous simple controls, usually just the mouse and their two buttons, some times the arrows pad is also neeced but, that's all. Very good music and sound effects....\nWell, if you already played Zuma, you know what I mean but, they have other interesting titles and this is one of them.\nHighly recommeded for casual tmes, when you are in a hurry and want to play just a bit or, for that "in between big games" time.\nA CONTINUATION OF PEEGLE'S DELUXE.

No other game does what Peggle does quite like it. The fun, interesting gameplay mechanic, somewhat pachinko esque, immediately captures your interest by it's quirky artwork and character selection, and leaves you hooked with it's various hilarious animations, noises and quotes from the Peggle Masters. Nothing quite beats the feeling of %100 a level and getting an Ultra Extreme Fever.\n\nThe gameplay in Peggle Nights is simple; drop a ball from the top of the screen in a 180 degree arc and hit all the orange pegs (And blue pegs for more points). You start with 10 balls and gain an extra ball every 25k points, or by landing it in the bucket at the bottom of the screen. Various Peggle "Masters" introduce new features such as the ball returning to the top of the screen after falling out the botom for a second drop, a blast that hits all pegs in a radius and so on.\n\nThe best feature of Peggle Nights is the music and background art. Each of these elements is done to insane levels, with the art painting a story in the background. The music is calm and relaxing, but changes dramatically to the Ode To Joy once you clear the last orange peg on the board.\n\nThis is the best game ever made. No other game is as good as Peggle Deluxe, or it's superior sequel Peggle Nights. Peggle 2 is decent, but nothing can compare to these two titans of games. Owning it on Steam(PC), Xbox 360 and IOS, Peggle is my favourite game of all time, and I'm sure if you gave it 5 minutes, you'd love it too.\n\n(Pick it up in the Peggle Complete Package when it's on sale for %50 off during the Steam Sales, or if you can go back in time, pick it up in the Humble Weekly Sale for $6 along with Peggle Deluxe and Plants Vs Zombies (And Bejewled and many other Popcap Titles)).\n\n1000000000000000000000000000000000/10","March 14, 2014","true","47.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

So... I'm copying and pasting my review from the other game.\n\nPeggle makes me happy. It's a stupidly pointless game that heavily resembled Pinko and I'm super ok with that. You launch a ball and try to clear all the orange "peggles" so you can proceed to the next level. Depending on who your character is, if you hit a green "peggle" it ignites their speical power which allows you to play the game a little effectively. Not exactly but close enough.\n\nSome of the levels are trickier than others. I know I've played some countless times just to try and clear it. Then again I have horrible predicting the trajectory even if the game is helpful enough to tell me where it will go after I position it to its first target. Though I am wicked at getting free balls.\n\nIf you like time killers and casual, brainless bliss, pick up this game.","April 16, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It’s part puzzle game, part platformer, part skill, and part luck. You shoot a ball out and attempt to take out all the red pegs. Blue pegs, and many other things, give you bonus points, but that’s about it. Sure, there are powerups, different masters, all kinds of different play modes, and so on, but that’s pretty much all there is to say about Peggle.\n\nHonestly, it’s only $15, it has a bunch of depth, it’s highly addictive, you can play with your friends, AND it’s two whole versions of Peggle. I wish there was more to say because Peggle is a damn fun game, but like many casual games (Diner Dash, Plants vs. Zombies, Bejeweled, etc.), the beauty is in its simplicity.

It's great to listen to music while playing, since the in-game sound is not needed (not saying it's bad) and because you don't really need to focus. That also makes Peggle a nice alternative to other games when you are tired or not feeling well.\n\nThere's not much else to say - so if you have $5 ready, go ahead and give this game a try!\n\nPS: I recommend Peggle Nights over Peggle Deluxe, just my opinion","September 1, 2014","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game has wonderful firework graphics that make it really entertaining when you complete the levels. The humor in the game is fun and there are creative fun characters in the game that really have special abilities to help you complete each level. The game doesn't take a long time to beat, but it has repeatability potential. This version of the game is set into the night life which is a nice change. The best thing about this game is the slow-mo in the end when you hit the last ping thingy. I like it that you can rerun the replay of the last ping being hit. The game can get frustrating and harder the further you go. You really have to think about each shot and were your going to place them. The game is great and is alot of fun to play, get it when you are debating weather or not to get it, because you wont regret buying this casual fun game!","April 2, 2011","true","6.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

But now, suddenly, this game (and all the other PopCap games) WILL NOT PLAY!\nI had this on my iMac for a couple of years, and it was great. But a recent HDD change forced me to redownload all my steam games. Now PvZ, Peggle, & Peggle Nights (all of them PopCap Games) don't work. I can't even get them to boot to the start screen.\n\nEA, I am disappointed. A vehement NO to receommending this game!","January 10","false","109.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I bought this game loaded it and played for about 25 minutes and had to stop to go do sopmething.  And now it does not load.  I get an error message.  It asked me to send in a report (which I did) and had an email address to contact them, so I wrote an email explaining what happened.  And guess what???  I got the email back saying it could not be delivered as I did not have permission.\n\nAs for the game....  It is a typical Peggle game.  Nothing special and very good if you like peggle games.  But it is not worth the $5 they want for it.  and especially since I cannot play it due to my curent problems with getting it to start.\n\nBe forwarned...  It may or may not run for you.","January 8","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Peggle Deluxe works; however Peggle Nights is zoomed in to the top left corner of the screen, stuck at 1080 resolution and nothing I do changes it. You can't access the menu unless you can see the bottom left of the main screen, and for some reason they did not include any menu access hotkeys like escape or an F-key. There are no solutions to this problem findable online, the community doesn't have a lot of answers to technical problems in general, and PopCap does not have a customer service department that they're wanting me to find through Steam. A fresh install does not fix it, nor does deleting every game file and starting all over. I have not once gotten to play Peggle Nights, so that part of the game cost was essentially a donation I didn't know I was making to a company that couldn't really care less. Clicking "Request Refund" is requesting a refund for the entire bundle, of which Peggle Deluxe actually works and I want to keep. However, unless I receive an answer to some community posts I'm afraid I have to give Peggle Nights a HUGE no-recommend, as the menu functionality is hogwash and the resolution issues are unfixable by any reasonable methods. When you start the game, it will be a tiny window on your screen. Opening the menu will make you think you have the option to change the resolution, as there are controls to do so, but you will be SOL if you make any changes to the native resolution so why the hell they give you the option to change it to 1080 and break it forever is beyond me. Disappointing, really.","January 9","false","2.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
