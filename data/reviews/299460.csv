You are born into a life of crime. From the day you are born, you are running around collecting debts owed to the family, being fruit, of course. If they can't pay up, then their tears will suffice. Sometimes you have to use force, because sometimes they fight back. Your only weapon is a leaf, but I swear I have yet to see a leaf capable of so much pain and destruction in all my years as this one, and I've seen a lot of leaves, my house has windows. All it takes is one fell swoop and any retaliator or rebel is vanquished. Sometimes innocent lives are lost as well, caught in the crossfire, however some live to complain and tell the tale and must be taken care of later. Their deaths are most tragic and graphic; they fall backwards as a sign of submission, then right after they give a little "squee" they burst into white flakes, completely vanishing from existance. Families will forever be torn apart, populations drastically affected by the murders, but you remain unphased. This is what you were meant to do, and you do it with a smile. I value the time I've spent playing "Woodle Tree Adventures", as it has shown me a side of this world that I would have never seen outside of my bubble. It not only immerses us in the hard life of crime, but has an underlying message of love for one's family and how far people or small tree creatures will go to do what is best for the family.","June 18, 2015","true","1.5"," 152 of 183 people (83%) found this review helpful 175 people found this review funny","83","152","183","175","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/299460/","stumpo","Stumpokapow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/","2598 products in account","First, I want to say that I understand that this is a game developed by a single person, I think it has some promise, and I absolutely support developers learning the ropes and trying to make it. So despite the fact that I can't recommend the game, I applaud the developer for his effort.\n\nThe game is a Super Mario 64 / Super Mario 3D Land style 3D platformer where the world is made up of a bunch of connected geometric objects. You're a tree. You can run, jump, swing a leaf to attack... and that's about it. The objective of each level is to get three water drops and get to the end of the level; there are also berries scattered around (around 100 berries per level or so). You don't need to collect berries to finish the game, but if you collect 200, 400, or 800 you can "upgrade" your leaf, at 850 you get a headband for your character which seems mostly cosmetic, and there's an optional hidden level at 600 berries. There are 6 main game levels plus the optional level. Each level takes about 8-10 minutes. Personally I 100%ed the game--that is to say beat all levels and unlocked all optional content or unlocks in-game--at 71 minutes.\n\nThe issue is that much of the core gameplay loop doesn't work very well. Your default walk speed is far too slow, your default run speed is far too fast to be controlled for precise jumps. The game also never tells you you can run, so, PRO-TIP: You can. Underwater, everything is too slow and the physics don't adjust at all besides movement speed. Jumping is not controlled very well and I frequently missed pretty easy jumps. There are clipping issues. There are almost-but-not-quite making a jump and getting stuck in the lip of geometry and having to jump again to get unstuck issues. There are also issues where you feel like you've picked up a berry but you aren't inside its hitbox, so you sort of wander back and forth until you pick it up. You almost never get good feedback--the "feel" of the game is a real problem.\n\nWhen you die (you will, frequently, enemies AI is basic, many enemies are stationary, the rest move in fixed patterns, but clipping is generally poor and it's difficult to tell if you're going to hit an enemy when you swing your weapon), you respawn instantly either at the beginning of the level or at a checkpoint, but you can't see where the checkpoints are and in my experience they're rarely where they make sense to be; but because enemies and items don't respawn when you die, you basically run through an empty level until you get back to where you died.\n\nThe camera is the biggest problem. The camera angle is frequently no good; for example, in a 3D platformer the camera should never be directly on your level facing straight, because it ruins depth perception entirely. The camera should never be so close that it obscures the action, and yet it is. Worse, as you collect berries, the bag your character holds gets bigger and bigger, so the obstruction is actually worse at the end of levels than at the beginning. You should never have to run towards the camera and take leap-of-faith jumps to get to platforms unless there's some visual indication that you ought to.\n\nIt's an hour long game, so obviously if you want to play it, you'll deal with the frustration. But it's pretty rare that you're playing and something isn't going to be bugging you.\n\nThe music's composition is not bad (it is a little simple, and it's not really catchy), but the author chooses very very very chintzy, cheap sounding samples for almost every instrument. In particular there's some sort of harpsichord used as one of the main instruments and it sounds really terrible. Sound effects are rare, to the point that the game feels a little unfinished because there are times where you expect sounds and don't get them.\n\nYou can't quit the game from inside the game without doing an Alt+F4 or Apple+Q or whatever. There's no main menu to go back to. When you beat the game, it sits at the end of the credits section. This is very frustrating to me. There's also no Steam Cloud support, and although the game is multi-platform, achievements don't work on the Mac or Linux versions.\n\nIt's a pity because the graphic side of things is very good. The enemies and your character are cute. The visual style is simple but colourful, and reminds me favourably of Mario 64 or Super Mario 3d Land. There are lots of little touches in the animation. If I had to guess, the guy is probably an animator or an artist who made a game, rather than a programmer.\n\nI don't want to dissuade the guy from continuing to make games and there are occasional hints of promise, but it comes off more as the kind of thing that would have been free online in the late 90s / early 00s, or the kind of thing that would be released on Desura. I am confident that before Steam changed the approval process to be more open last year, this game would not have seen release. Moreover, the dev is still actively patching the game, but a lot of what he's adding in seems to be stuff that would be typical of a 1.0 release, which makes it seem even more like a hobby project.\n\nIt's definitely an earnest effort and I hope the dev keeps trying, but I don't think it's /there/ and besides supporting the dev, I don't really feel like there's much to recommend here.","August 7, 2014","false","1.2"," 96 of 108 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","96","108","6","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/299460/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","I wish I had something good to say about Woodle Tree Adventures. It's colorful art style brings back fond memories of classic 3D platformers, which much to my dismay have all but disappeared from gaming in recent years. As much as I wanted to love Woodle, as a game it's among the worst designed, most disappointing experiences I've had in a very long time. It took only an hour of my time to complete, but it felt like so much more with how depressing those sixty minutes were.\n\nWoodle Tree is a very traditional collectathon platformer on paper; traverse levels picking up inane objects to bring back a spirit tree that's grown sad over the disappearing water of the world. Upon actually playing the game, everything instantly loses its enticing charm, reduced to a lesson in how to completely ruin a genre that I hold especially close to my heart.\n\nAt the forefront of all these problems is the games camera, which for reasons I cannot understand was chosen to be fixed in place, presumably moving with you and positioning itself as to best allow you to get through levels. This is a bad idea for more reasons than I care to list, the biggest being that it makes judging the distance for jumps incredibly difficult, not to mention caused me an extreme amount of motion sickness (something I've never experience in a game). Levels are designed with a noticeable lack in direction, full of pointless dead ends, oddly position platforms, and invisible checkpoints that neither tell you when you reach them or work as intended much of the time.\n\nThe sound design is just sad to have to listen to, with awful sound effects and a soundtrack that is chaotic, perhaps even musically offensive. The cute art design is the only thing I can give scant amounts of praise to, but even that loses its charm when it jumps radically between styles, none of which are particularly interesting to look at or even reflect the lighthearted feel the game seems to be going for.\n\nI'd like to say Woodle Tree Adventures isn't one of the most dismal games I've played recently, but there is nothing I can even partially recommend it for, and wish I'd headed the words of others and passed on it myself. It left me feeling hollow, and sad for the developer who almost seemed to have something at a point before it slipped through his fingers.\n\nIt's really no wonder the spirit tree is crying. I would too if I was stuck in this game any longer than I was.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 9, 2014","false","1.5"," 223 of 291 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","223","291","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/madfriaravelyn/recommended/299460/","madfriaravelyn","MadFriarAvelyn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/madfriaravelyn/","1074 products in account","A cheap, low-effort, unpolished platformer.  Includes six levels for you to platform around, with the main goal being to collect three tears in a level before you can exit and progress to the next level.  Other collectibles include berries, which have only two uses: unlocking achievements and buying optional weapon upgrades.  The former are useless, the latter are only debatably useful, as many enemies are easily avoidable, and in a worse case easy to dispatch with your default weapon.  To make matters worse, there are three tiers of weapon upgrades you can get.  The first one lets your leaf fire a projectile (to make dispatching the already easily avoidable enemies trivial).  The second and third?  A simple color change, and a different particle effect for the projectile you shoot.  Not worth the effort to farm the berries for them.  Because of this, the game doesn't give you much motivation to actually collect any of the (non-required) collectibles.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, the platforming isn't very tight.  Controls are often loose and slippery, which can lead to many frustrating deaths.  These deaths are made all the more frustrating with an inconsistent "checkpoint" system implemented in the game that randomly decides to respawn you in a fair location close to where you died, or at the start of the level.  However, once you get adjusted to this, the platforming just tends to be easy and...boring.  Even the enemies in the game present no challenge, often standing still and waiting for you to kill them.  There are maybe a half dozen enemies in the game total that provide a greater challenge of...moving in a line.  Literally one enemy in the game fires projectiles.  None of which are hard to deal with (except for the last one, which is elaborated on below).  The game does include a local co-op mode, but I fail to see a point to it, as (at least in the hub world) the second player is almost exclusively tied to the first player as the camera is locked on that player, leaving no extra incentives bring a second player as that player can't even help you explore and complete the level more quickly.\n\nFrom a presentation perspective, the game looks cheap: almost every object is a simple mashup of a basic 3D construct, a cube, a cylinder, or a cone, scaled to give the illusion of a more complex object.  Animations, where they exist, are usually basic looping idle, or walking animations where the models in question simply waggle their arms or legs about.  Enemies, when dispatched, often simply fall over and just...vanish.  Sometimes with a poof of (barely recognizable) smoke, and sometimes with an extra sound effect.  Textures are simplistic, often including no detail.  One shining example of this lack of detail are the levels that include a snow effect, where the snow is represented by...an extra white, untextured cube stacked on top of other level geometry.  Finally, there are some very strange camera positioning choices in the game, and since the game doesn't let you adjust your camera angle or position, can make some sections more difficult than they need to be.  Finally, the music and sound effects in the game are completely unremarkable, with the end-of-level jingle being a recording of someone mashing an out-of-tune piano.\n\nThe game is also buggy.  Bugs encountered during my playthrough include: being pushed through the level geometry to my death by a moving platform, enemies that fire projectiles continuing to fire projectiles even after being killed, jumping up against the corner of certain geometry in the level causing the player character to flip upside down and become stuck, random white square appearing on the screen in the hub world (I assume these are meant to be dialog boxes of some kind, but don't display properly), camera angles often not correcting themselves when moving through a level, or after a death, and on rare occasions sticking in the pre-level cutscene position when you enter a level, rendering it unbeatable (since you can't see where your character is).  The worst offender though: the number of fruit you collect from a level doesn't reset when you exit a level unless you reset the game.  This allows you to enter a level, collect a ton of fruit, exit the level (which adds it to the total necessary for unlocking the achievements and the unlockable weapons), then re-enter the level and immediately exit to add the same amount of fruit to your total again.  You can do this non-stop to unlock all of the collectibles in the game, without even going past the first level.\n\nMy final thoughts: I feel like this game was the end result of a single developer new to developing video games.  The credits back me up on this, as many of the roles listed were done by the same person, with one exception besides the special thanks section.  If I take that into account, I encourage that developer to keep writing new games, as they're moving in a step in the right direction.  But I encourage them, for future titles, to remember to make the gamplay engaging and rewarding, to make smarter game design choices in terms of controls and presentation, and to spend some extra time polishing the game and stomping out bugs.  I also recommend not trying to compare your games to, frankly superior games (such as Super Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie, which this game was compared to), when the only similarities are you can jump and collect things.\n\nOnly buy Woodle Tree Adventures if you desperately want to waste 30-60 minutes of your life, and you have literally nothing better to spend $3 on.","June 7, 2014","false","1.4"," 150 of 211 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","150","211","0","3"

This game currently isn't worth the price it is at, so I would recommend either waiting until a sale or playing the demo and decide yourself. You will get 3/6 card drops and achievements that are attainable in a time frame of 2 - 5 hours as one will need an exploit to complete.\n\nReview:  Woodle Tree Adventures  starts with the birth of the hero, the player. You rise from the ground and are then subsequently greeted by your father who then gives his newborn son a task - bring water "to this thirsty world!" This sets the story for the rest of the game, you must collect fairy tears to unlock new stages to get more fairy tears. But that's not the only thing you can collect, you can also collect berries to unlock new gear and get achievements.\n\nThe last remaing feature of gameplay is combat - you have a few enemies to face or dodge. There is nothing unique with the controls, you are able to run, jump, attack and defend whilst directing Woodle with W,A,S,D if you're using a mouse and keyboard. But the main problem is camera control, or the lack there of. The camera makes it hard to move around, as it suddenly zooms in/out or changes the view completly, causing you to often fall off. Combined with hardly any checkpoints, this is irritating as you will be sent back to the start or a considerable amount away from where you were. I have yet to try out local co-op as not even my little sister (the games target market) wanted to play the game.\n\nAudio is okay, however there was one level where the audio was irksome, I had to mute the game until the level was complete. The game comes with a free soundtrack but again the soundtrack isn't something special.Graphics do play a small role in this game as they introduce the theme of the level; but rather end up looking like something I made when I was teaching a 10 year old to use a game making software. If you get headaches and/or migranes easily, stay away from this game. Often the bright colours clash together and not in a good way, with textures also overlapping often. Animations are done well despite the graphics and movement is suprisingly fluid. The levels themselves aren't that creative, going with the true and tested themes of a beach and snowy mountins to mention a few.\n\nTo complete the set of cards you will need to get 6 cards in total, with 3 being droppend for playing the game. Personally the badges, emoticons and backgrounds aren't that good loking or creative; apart from the cloudy background which can be used creativley to create a pleasant artwork showcase.\n\nOverall, if you just want the game for the achievements and card drops, wait until it's on sale as it sometimes goes down to £0.03. The game just isn't good enough to support the regular price of £1.99 as again this feels like another tester game from Fabio Ferrara.\n\nIf you like my review, any feedback is appreciated and if you would like to see more reviews from me in the future, feel free to follow me!","April 30","false","5.4"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","29","33","3","0"

Oh yeah, and those demons, all of them kill you with one hit. Not only demons will make you have cancer, also frikkin tentacle swinging ghouls. Nai shokushu! Oh and those "silly jumping puzzles" make deadcore look like childplay.\nWell then should i buy this game?\nYeah man, if you go to the free steam key reddit page, you can get your copy of this game, but I recommend buying it. It is recommended to have some experience in hard games first. I suggest finishing super hexagon, dark souls, deadcore and doom on nightmare mode, before even considering playing this game","March 24","true","2.7"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","78","25","32","33","1"

The small amount of cut scenes take forever and play very slowly. Sometimes when you die, you have to go back to the very beginning.

The graphics are charming, the soundtrack is nicely chill and the lack of stuff like time limits is quite nice.  It's got serious potential, but a few negative aspects really work against that potential.\n\nThe first and most damaging is the fact that you cannot control the camera.  In a 3D platformer where it's very easy to mis-time your jumps, that's a quick road to frustration.  Even worse, sometimes the game will change your camera angle for you, making it hard to see a jump that a moment before was perfectly visible.  Add in the fact that if the character's pack is full it enlarges so much sometimes that you have trouble seeing past it and you can see that earlier potential just start to bleed away in a flurry of missed jumps.\n\nThe second flaw doesn't directly affect gameplay, but it affects immersion a lot.  That is, the character animation.  For the most part this is fine, and I really do like little touches like being able to jump until Woodle is upside-down.  Charming.  But when walking about the world, I noticed very quick that the walk animation doesn't interact at all with the ground.  The speed at which you move seems independant of the motion of the legs, giving a feel of sliding about which may not seem like a lot but since you have to look at this for the entire game, it gets a bit bothersome.  And to a degree, since you can't really tell speed from watching the character, sometimes it's hard to judge jumps and you're down into the abyss again.\n\nThe third is the general lack of explanation of anything.  I've played up to where I was able to buy a second leaf mainly by accident.  I had no idea why I was supposed to gather fruits until I pretty much randomly wandered outside the house for a bit.  I'm not really sure what it does yet, since there's no explanation when you get it, so I guess trial and error?  In any case, the game doesn't really give you anything to tell you that upgrading your leaf is significant, so it almost feels like the game doesn't care.  Even a little fanfare would be nice.\n\nOverall, I'd say maybe a 6.5/10.  Barely recommend, mainly based on the remaining charm and the knowledge that updates seem to be planned.  Hopefully they'll fix some of these issues.","June 7, 2014","true","0.7"," 29 of 42 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","29","42","0","0"

Artwork and models appealing to maybe the younger audiences or more oldschool gamers out there. The controls are easy to use and handle, making it comfortable and friendly to play.\nThe game lacks base and depth, there feels like there is hardly any objective as the game is mind numbingly boring and easy, taking you through 6 worlds with the same mechanics and mobs.\nAlthough the music is really good, it is the same ~10 seconds of music looped over and over, without it changing through the levels, making a really repetative listening experience.\nThe story is about saving the world with water drops you collect on your adventures, however, this feels like a task that has very little reward and no feeling of satisfaction upon completion. In this world, very few mobs fight back and everything is a 1 hit kill. but when you touch these mobs, you die instantly and are sent back to the start of the level! Your progress isn't even reset, the mobs and items are still in the same place, you just have to run back to where you left off, which can be a very annoying task when your camera is glitched into the floor!\nI hate to bash games with only wrong things about it, but I feel I summed up all the good things in the second sentence of this review.\n\nIt took me a total of 2 hours to fully complete the game and 20 minutes to speed run it.\nI DO NOT RECOMMEND this game as it costs 3 dollars which could be spent on a better game such as the Binding of Isaac, in my opinion.","March 21, 2015","false","2.2"," 25 of 35 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","25","35","3","1"

I want to like this game.\nIt has a lot of potential to be much better if the dev put in the extra effort to polish it.\n\nThe controls are so close, but still feel very early access-y.\nAdd that on top of iffy hit boxes for enemies and platforms and it makes for potentially\nvery frustrating times.\n\nCameras are a bit frustrating too since you can only partially control them.\nYou can control zoom in/out, but not pan or pitch, which is horrible on certain levels.\nMiss any platform and you fall into oblivion. So on levels where the camera stays low,\nits almost impossible to see where the holes are.\n\nAs a result its difficult to see where exactly you are in relation to enemies and platform edges.\nSome interactive objects, that you need in order to get to certain areas, like wind pillars that are supposed to lift you up, don't always work.  Several times I would finally manage to get into them without just falling out the other side (because the character doesn't slow down once in) instead of lifting me up, i slowly float down helplessly...then fall out the other side.\n\nIts too bad because my kids love it too, but they can't enjoy it for long before getting upset because of all the above.\nAnd normally they hand the controller to me if something is too difficult.  I wish it were just a matter of it being too\ndifficult, but it's not. The game is not difficult. It just needs to function consistently.\n\nId love to recommend this game because of how close it is to being done. But until the dev puts in the effort to polish out all the major glitches and hitboxes and bad camera, I can't recommend it. And that is a shame.\nIt should still be considered Early Access. the low price can't save it. It just needs to be tweaked and finished.\nIf that happens I will gladly change my review.","March 6","false","2.9"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

It's platforming at it's very basic, and I love it so much.\n\nYou play as a cute tree stump named Woodle who are being asked to bring back water to the forest. On each level there are three water drops hidden somewhere on the map, and you need to collect all three of them to complete the level. The only way to defend yourself against the enemies is hitting them with a leaf. You will make them dissapear in one hit, but in one hit they will send you far back in the level.\n\nWoodle carries a bag in which he puts berries into that are scattered around the level, there are so many of them. With the berries you can unlock levels and upgrade your leaf so it becomes better. When you have enough berries you can unlock a cute bandana for Woodle so he looks even cuter.\n\nIt's one of my favourite games because of how simple it is to play, and how really cute everything looks. Sometimes you can't tell difference between a good person and an enemy. I like the level designs and the fitting soundtrack. I love the snow level especially. The only negative thing about Woodle Tree Adventures is the camera. It's a mess to control and it often gets stuck behind a block so you can't see where you're going.\n\nIt takes around an hour to complete, and it's really enjoyable for that short time. :3","November 11, 2014","true","3.6"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

The other problem I had with the game was that if it really was targeted towards pre-schoolers and such, I myself wouldn't really let my kid play games before he was actually intelligent enough to understand the concept of video games and rela life.\n\nOverall, somwhat enjoyable game for a low price.","November 26, 2015","true","2.3"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","14","19","2","0"

The Devs really knew how to pick music and sounds, everything makes the cutest of sounds, mostly the sound of when you are killing the creatures and the sound of picking up berries. 10/10\n\nCinematics - Well this will be a hard, because there are little to no cinematics at all, but I don't consider this as a weakness. It's mostly just bubble text on a picture, but the picture is alive and moving and the text is bubbly. 8/10\n\nStory - It was well paced, for a 1 hour or so story. But it wasn't anything unique, you are born, go do this and that and try to save the world, then save the world. A story as normal as it can get. 6/10\n\nContent - For the 3 euro the game wants, you will be suprised but it is actually pretty cheap, yes it is rather short and yes it doesn't have anything more than other 3-D platformers. You get a variety of worlds to explore (6) and to live a life of constant dying, because your GOOD FOR NOTHING FATHER, made you do so. 8/10\n\nControls - This is the game weakest point, it is living HELL if you are playing on a mouse+keyboard, it is not as responsive as a controler. Don't get me wrong, it is still playable on a computer with a mouse and keyboard setup, but on a controler it is a million times better. 5/10 for mouse+keyboard and 9/10 on a controler\n\nGameplay - The gameplay is fun and fluent, you can traverse everything you see, but at some moments it can get frustrating, mostly because of the games horrible checkpoint system and mediocre camera tracking. When you inevitably fall to your doom, it will respawn you to the nearest checkpoint, but after the 3'rd or so fall, the game just snaps and respawns at the very start of the level. 7/10\n\n\nOverall the game is not at all bad, don't be fooled by the length or the simple graphics, it is a fun little experience, and if you tell me in which other game do you get to play as stumb trying to save the world, then hat's off to you good sir. For the price you are going to pay for this game, you will get out a changed person or dog, hope I helped and cleared some things up about this game.\nOverall score: 7.5/10","June 20, 2015","true","2.5"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","68","15","22","3","0"

You are born into a life of crime. From the day you are born, you are running around collecting debts owed to the family, being fruit, of course. If they can't pay up, then their tears will suffice. Sometimes you have to use force, because sometimes they fight back. Your only weapon is a leaf, but I swear I have yet to see a leaf capable of so much pain and destruction in all my years as this one, and I've seen a lot of leaves, my house has windows. All it takes is one fell swoop and any retaliator or rebel is vanquished. Sometimes innocent lives are lost as well, caught in the crossfire, however some live to complain and tell the tale and must be taken care of later. Their deaths are most tragic and graphic; they fall backwards as a sign of submission, then right after they give a little "squee" they burst into white flakes, completely vanishing from existance. Families will forever be torn apart, populations drastically affected by the murders, but you remain unphased. This is what you were meant to do, and you do it with a smile. I value the time I've spent playing "Woodle Tree Adventures", as it has shown me a side of this world that I would have never seen outside of my bubble. It not only immerses us in the hard life of crime, but has an underlying message of love for one's family and how far people or small tree creatures will go to do what is best for the family.","June 18, 2015","true","1.5"," 152 of 183 people (83%) found this review helpful 175 people found this review funny","83","152","183","175","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/recommended/299460/","stumpo","Stumpokapow","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stumpo/","2598 products in account","First, I want to say that I understand that this is a game developed by a single person, I think it has some promise, and I absolutely support developers learning the ropes and trying to make it. So despite the fact that I can't recommend the game, I applaud the developer for his effort.\n\nThe game is a Super Mario 64 / Super Mario 3D Land style 3D platformer where the world is made up of a bunch of connected geometric objects. You're a tree. You can run, jump, swing a leaf to attack... and that's about it. The objective of each level is to get three water drops and get to the end of the level; there are also berries scattered around (around 100 berries per level or so). You don't need to collect berries to finish the game, but if you collect 200, 400, or 800 you can "upgrade" your leaf, at 850 you get a headband for your character which seems mostly cosmetic, and there's an optional hidden level at 600 berries. There are 6 main game levels plus the optional level. Each level takes about 8-10 minutes. Personally I 100%ed the game--that is to say beat all levels and unlocked all optional content or unlocks in-game--at 71 minutes.\n\nThe issue is that much of the core gameplay loop doesn't work very well. Your default walk speed is far too slow, your default run speed is far too fast to be controlled for precise jumps. The game also never tells you you can run, so, PRO-TIP: You can. Underwater, everything is too slow and the physics don't adjust at all besides movement speed. Jumping is not controlled very well and I frequently missed pretty easy jumps. There are clipping issues. There are almost-but-not-quite making a jump and getting stuck in the lip of geometry and having to jump again to get unstuck issues. There are also issues where you feel like you've picked up a berry but you aren't inside its hitbox, so you sort of wander back and forth until you pick it up. You almost never get good feedback--the "feel" of the game is a real problem.\n\nWhen you die (you will, frequently, enemies AI is basic, many enemies are stationary, the rest move in fixed patterns, but clipping is generally poor and it's difficult to tell if you're going to hit an enemy when you swing your weapon), you respawn instantly either at the beginning of the level or at a checkpoint, but you can't see where the checkpoints are and in my experience they're rarely where they make sense to be; but because enemies and items don't respawn when you die, you basically run through an empty level until you get back to where you died.\n\nThe camera is the biggest problem. The camera angle is frequently no good; for example, in a 3D platformer the camera should never be directly on your level facing straight, because it ruins depth perception entirely. The camera should never be so close that it obscures the action, and yet it is. Worse, as you collect berries, the bag your character holds gets bigger and bigger, so the obstruction is actually worse at the end of levels than at the beginning. You should never have to run towards the camera and take leap-of-faith jumps to get to platforms unless there's some visual indication that you ought to.\n\nIt's an hour long game, so obviously if you want to play it, you'll deal with the frustration. But it's pretty rare that you're playing and something isn't going to be bugging you.\n\nThe music's composition is not bad (it is a little simple, and it's not really catchy), but the author chooses very very very chintzy, cheap sounding samples for almost every instrument. In particular there's some sort of harpsichord used as one of the main instruments and it sounds really terrible. Sound effects are rare, to the point that the game feels a little unfinished because there are times where you expect sounds and don't get them.\n\nYou can't quit the game from inside the game without doing an Alt+F4 or Apple+Q or whatever. There's no main menu to go back to. When you beat the game, it sits at the end of the credits section. This is very frustrating to me. There's also no Steam Cloud support, and although the game is multi-platform, achievements don't work on the Mac or Linux versions.\n\nIt's a pity because the graphic side of things is very good. The enemies and your character are cute. The visual style is simple but colourful, and reminds me favourably of Mario 64 or Super Mario 3d Land. There are lots of little touches in the animation. If I had to guess, the guy is probably an animator or an artist who made a game, rather than a programmer.\n\nI don't want to dissuade the guy from continuing to make games and there are occasional hints of promise, but it comes off more as the kind of thing that would have been free online in the late 90s / early 00s, or the kind of thing that would be released on Desura. I am confident that before Steam changed the approval process to be more open last year, this game would not have seen release. Moreover, the dev is still actively patching the game, but a lot of what he's adding in seems to be stuff that would be typical of a 1.0 release, which makes it seem even more like a hobby project.\n\nIt's definitely an earnest effort and I hope the dev keeps trying, but I don't think it's /there/ and besides supporting the dev, I don't really feel like there's much to recommend here.","August 7, 2014","false","1.2"," 96 of 108 people (89%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","89","96","108","6","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/299460/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","I wish I had something good to say about Woodle Tree Adventures. It's colorful art style brings back fond memories of classic 3D platformers, which much to my dismay have all but disappeared from gaming in recent years. As much as I wanted to love Woodle, as a game it's among the worst designed, most disappointing experiences I've had in a very long time. It took only an hour of my time to complete, but it felt like so much more with how depressing those sixty minutes were.\n\nWoodle Tree is a very traditional collectathon platformer on paper; traverse levels picking up inane objects to bring back a spirit tree that's grown sad over the disappearing water of the world. Upon actually playing the game, everything instantly loses its enticing charm, reduced to a lesson in how to completely ruin a genre that I hold especially close to my heart.\n\nAt the forefront of all these problems is the games camera, which for reasons I cannot understand was chosen to be fixed in place, presumably moving with you and positioning itself as to best allow you to get through levels. This is a bad idea for more reasons than I care to list, the biggest being that it makes judging the distance for jumps incredibly difficult, not to mention caused me an extreme amount of motion sickness (something I've never experience in a game). Levels are designed with a noticeable lack in direction, full of pointless dead ends, oddly position platforms, and invisible checkpoints that neither tell you when you reach them or work as intended much of the time.\n\nThe sound design is just sad to have to listen to, with awful sound effects and a soundtrack that is chaotic, perhaps even musically offensive. The cute art design is the only thing I can give scant amounts of praise to, but even that loses its charm when it jumps radically between styles, none of which are particularly interesting to look at or even reflect the lighthearted feel the game seems to be going for.\n\nI'd like to say Woodle Tree Adventures isn't one of the most dismal games I've played recently, but there is nothing I can even partially recommend it for, and wish I'd headed the words of others and passed on it myself. It left me feeling hollow, and sad for the developer who almost seemed to have something at a point before it slipped through his fingers.\n\nIt's really no wonder the spirit tree is crying. I would too if I was stuck in this game any longer than I was.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","June 9, 2014","false","1.5"," 223 of 291 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","223","291","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/madfriaravelyn/recommended/299460/","madfriaravelyn","MadFriarAvelyn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/madfriaravelyn/","1074 products in account","A cheap, low-effort, unpolished platformer.  Includes six levels for you to platform around, with the main goal being to collect three tears in a level before you can exit and progress to the next level.  Other collectibles include berries, which have only two uses: unlocking achievements and buying optional weapon upgrades.  The former are useless, the latter are only debatably useful, as many enemies are easily avoidable, and in a worse case easy to dispatch with your default weapon.  To make matters worse, there are three tiers of weapon upgrades you can get.  The first one lets your leaf fire a projectile (to make dispatching the already easily avoidable enemies trivial).  The second and third?  A simple color change, and a different particle effect for the projectile you shoot.  Not worth the effort to farm the berries for them.  Because of this, the game doesn't give you much motivation to actually collect any of the (non-required) collectibles.\n\nFrom a gameplay perspective, the platforming isn't very tight.  Controls are often loose and slippery, which can lead to many frustrating deaths.  These deaths are made all the more frustrating with an inconsistent "checkpoint" system implemented in the game that randomly decides to respawn you in a fair location close to where you died, or at the start of the level.  However, once you get adjusted to this, the platforming just tends to be easy and...boring.  Even the enemies in the game present no challenge, often standing still and waiting for you to kill them.  There are maybe a half dozen enemies in the game total that provide a greater challenge of...moving in a line.  Literally one enemy in the game fires projectiles.  None of which are hard to deal with (except for the last one, which is elaborated on below).  The game does include a local co-op mode, but I fail to see a point to it, as (at least in the hub world) the second player is almost exclusively tied to the first player as the camera is locked on that player, leaving no extra incentives bring a second player as that player can't even help you explore and complete the level more quickly.\n\nFrom a presentation perspective, the game looks cheap: almost every object is a simple mashup of a basic 3D construct, a cube, a cylinder, or a cone, scaled to give the illusion of a more complex object.  Animations, where they exist, are usually basic looping idle, or walking animations where the models in question simply waggle their arms or legs about.  Enemies, when dispatched, often simply fall over and just...vanish.  Sometimes with a poof of (barely recognizable) smoke, and sometimes with an extra sound effect.  Textures are simplistic, often including no detail.  One shining example of this lack of detail are the levels that include a snow effect, where the snow is represented by...an extra white, untextured cube stacked on top of other level geometry.  Finally, there are some very strange camera positioning choices in the game, and since the game doesn't let you adjust your camera angle or position, can make some sections more difficult than they need to be.  Finally, the music and sound effects in the game are completely unremarkable, with the end-of-level jingle being a recording of someone mashing an out-of-tune piano.\n\nThe game is also buggy.  Bugs encountered during my playthrough include: being pushed through the level geometry to my death by a moving platform, enemies that fire projectiles continuing to fire projectiles even after being killed, jumping up against the corner of certain geometry in the level causing the player character to flip upside down and become stuck, random white square appearing on the screen in the hub world (I assume these are meant to be dialog boxes of some kind, but don't display properly), camera angles often not correcting themselves when moving through a level, or after a death, and on rare occasions sticking in the pre-level cutscene position when you enter a level, rendering it unbeatable (since you can't see where your character is).  The worst offender though: the number of fruit you collect from a level doesn't reset when you exit a level unless you reset the game.  This allows you to enter a level, collect a ton of fruit, exit the level (which adds it to the total necessary for unlocking the achievements and the unlockable weapons), then re-enter the level and immediately exit to add the same amount of fruit to your total again.  You can do this non-stop to unlock all of the collectibles in the game, without even going past the first level.\n\nMy final thoughts: I feel like this game was the end result of a single developer new to developing video games.  The credits back me up on this, as many of the roles listed were done by the same person, with one exception besides the special thanks section.  If I take that into account, I encourage that developer to keep writing new games, as they're moving in a step in the right direction.  But I encourage them, for future titles, to remember to make the gamplay engaging and rewarding, to make smarter game design choices in terms of controls and presentation, and to spend some extra time polishing the game and stomping out bugs.

This game currently isn't worth the price it is at, so I would recommend either waiting until a sale or playing the demo and decide yourself. You will get 3/6 card drops and achievements that are attainable in a time frame of 2 - 5 hours as one will need an exploit to complete.\n\nReview:  Woodle Tree Adventures  starts with the birth of the hero, the player. You rise from the ground and are then subsequently greeted by your father who then gives his newborn son a task - bring water "to this thirsty world!" This sets the story for the rest of the game, you must collect fairy tears to unlock new stages to get more fairy tears. But that's not the only thing you can collect, you can also collect berries to unlock new gear and get achievements.\n\nThe last remaing feature of gameplay is combat - you have a few enemies to face or dodge. There is nothing unique with the controls, you are able to run, jump, attack and defend whilst directing Woodle with W,A,S,D if you're using a mouse and keyboard. But the main problem is camera control, or the lack there of. The camera makes it hard to move around, as it suddenly zooms in/out or changes the view completly, causing you to often fall off. Combined with hardly any checkpoints, this is irritating as you will be sent back to the start or a considerable amount away from where you were. I have yet to try out local co-op as not even my little sister (the games target market) wanted to play the game.\n\nAudio is okay, however there was one level where the audio was irksome, I had to mute the game until the level was complete. The game comes with a free soundtrack but again the soundtrack isn't something special.Graphics do play a small role in this game as they introduce the theme of the level; but rather end up looking like something I made when I was teaching a 10 year old to use a game making software. If you get headaches and/or migranes easily, stay away from this game. Often the bright colours clash together and not in a good way, with textures also overlapping often. Animations are done well despite the graphics and movement is suprisingly fluid. The levels themselves aren't that creative, going with the true and tested themes of a beach and snowy mountins to mention a few.\n\nTo complete the set of cards you will need to get 6 cards in total, with 3 being droppend for playing the game. Personally the badges, emoticons and backgrounds aren't that good loking or creative; apart from the cloudy background which can be used creativley to create a pleasant artwork showcase.\n\nOverall, if you just want the game for the achievements and card drops, wait until it's on sale as it sometimes goes down to £0.03. The game just isn't good enough to support the regular price of £1.99 as again this feels like another tester game from Fabio Ferrara.\n\nIf you like my review, any feedback is appreciated and if you would like to see more reviews from me in the future, feel free to follow me!","April 30","false","5.4"," 29 of 33 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","29","33","3","0"

Cute story for kids and people who like talking trees and magic (THE DEKU TREE)\n\nThe character is floaty and hard to move most of the time and what makes it even more difficult is the awful camera angles that are nearly impossible to alter or change. The art is cute and child friendly and gives a nice warm feeling, but that soon died down when the gameplay started to show flaws.\n\nWhen you die from touching enemies or falling off the map you are teleported back to the starting spawn location and in some maps, that can be annoying and tedious when the camerapans down or in odd areas along with sluggish character movement. Clunky combat aswell, once you get 200 berries and upgrade to the yellow leaf, you have ranged capabilities which should be a starting trait, as mobs will touch you out of hitbox and sometimes kill you even when not in contact.\n\nEasy gameplay makes it simple to pick up or grasp for young children or inexperienced gamers. Thats a plus.\n\nFor its base price of 3$ I would say save your money for something else of similar value or something in the 5$ range.

The graphics are charming, the soundtrack is nicely chill and the lack of stuff like time limits is quite nice.  It's got serious potential, but a few negative aspects really work against that potential.\n\nThe first and most damaging is the fact that you cannot control the camera.  In a 3D platformer where it's very easy to mis-time your jumps, that's a quick road to frustration.  Even worse, sometimes the game will change your camera angle for you, making it hard to see a jump that a moment before was perfectly visible.  Add in the fact that if the character's pack is full it enlarges so much sometimes that you have trouble seeing past it and you can see that earlier potential just start to bleed away in a flurry of missed jumps.\n\nThe second flaw doesn't directly affect gameplay, but it affects immersion a lot.  That is, the character animation.  For the most part this is fine, and I really do like little touches like being able to jump until Woodle is upside-down.  Charming.  But when walking about the world, I noticed very quick that the walk animation doesn't interact at all with the ground.  The speed at which you move seems independant of the motion of the legs, giving a feel of sliding about which may not seem like a lot but since you have to look at this for the entire game, it gets a bit bothersome.  And to a degree, since you can't really tell speed from watching the character, sometimes it's hard to judge jumps and you're down into the abyss again.\n\nThe third is the general lack of explanation of anything.  I've played up to where I was able to buy a second leaf mainly by accident.  I had no idea why I was supposed to gather fruits until I pretty much randomly wandered outside the house for a bit.  I'm not really sure what it does yet, since there's no explanation when you get it, so I guess trial and error?  In any case, the game doesn't really give you anything to tell you that upgrading your leaf is significant, so it almost feels like the game doesn't care.  Even a little fanfare would be nice.\n\nOverall, I'd say maybe a 6.5/10.  Barely recommend, mainly based on the remaining charm and the knowledge that updates seem to be planned.  Hopefully they'll fix some of these issues.","June 7, 2014","true","0.7"," 29 of 42 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","29","42","0","0"

I want to like this game.\nIt has a lot of potential to be much better if the dev put in the extra effort to polish it.\n\nThe controls are so close, but still feel very early access-y.\nAdd that on top of iffy hit boxes for enemies and platforms and it makes for potentially\nvery frustrating times.\n\nCameras are a bit frustrating too since you can only partially control them.\nYou can control zoom in/out, but not pan or pitch, which is horrible on certain levels.\nMiss any platform and you fall into oblivion. So on levels where the camera stays low,\nits almost impossible to see where the holes are.\n\nAs a result its difficult to see where exactly you are in relation to enemies and platform edges.\nSome interactive objects, that you need in order to get to certain areas, like wind pillars that are supposed to lift you up, don't always work.  Several times I would finally manage to get into them without just falling out the other side (because the character doesn't slow down once in) instead of lifting me up, i slowly float down helplessly...then fall out the other side.\n\nIts too bad because my kids love it too, but they can't enjoy it for long before getting upset because of all the above.\nAnd normally they hand the controller to me if something is too difficult.  I wish it were just a matter of it being too\ndifficult, but it's not. The game is not difficult. It just needs to function consistently.\n\nId love to recommend this game because of how close it is to being done. But until the dev puts in the effort to polish out all the major glitches and hitboxes and bad camera, I can't recommend it.

It's got serious potential, but a few negative aspects really work against that potential.\n\nThe first and most damaging is the fact that you cannot control the camera. In a 3D platformer where it's very easy to mis-time your jumps, that's a quick road to frustration. Even worse, sometimes the game will change your camera angle for you, making it hard to see a jump that a moment before was perfectly visible. Add in the fact that if the character's pack is full it enlarges so much sometimes that you have trouble seeing past it and you can see that earlier potential just start to bleed away in a flurry of missed jumps.\n\nThe second flaw doesn't directly affect gameplay, but it affects immersion a lot. That is, the character animation. For the most part this is fine, and I really do like little touches like being able to jump until Woodle is upside-down. Charming. But when walking about the world, I noticed very quick that the walk animation doesn't interact at all with the ground. The speed at which you move seems independant of the motion of the legs, giving a feel of sliding about which may not seem like a lot but since you have to look at this for the entire game, it gets a bit bothersome. And to a degree, since you can't really tell speed from watching the character, sometimes it's hard to judge jumps and you're down into the abyss again.\n\nThe third is the general lack of explanation of anything. I've played up to where I was able to buy a second leaf mainly by accident. I had no idea why I was supposed to gather fruits until I pretty much randomly wandered outside the house for a bit. I'm not really sure what it does yet, since there's no explanation when you get it, so I guess trial and error? In any case, the game doesn't really give you anything to tell you that upgrading your leaf is significant, so it almost feels like the game doesn't care. Even a little fanfare would be nice.\n\nOverall, I'd say maybe a 6.5/10. Barely recommend, mainly based on the remaining charm and the knowledge that updates seem to be planned. Hopefully they'll fix some of these issues.\nBefore begin, who is the genius who doesn´t know there exist a thing called "paused", seriously is stupid you press "Esc" and the game closed...totally.\n\nThe thing can´t be more simply, you need to collect 3 tears in every level to restore an old tree because is old and blah blah blah blah is dying or something.\n\nLevels are short (it have 6 levels and one extra)\n\nBut is replayable to find more berries to unlok leafs and achievements...\n\nIs very easy if you don´t do a ragequit the first 5 minutes if you fall.\n\nRelaxing music.+\n\nThe coop achievement....seriously? you need to have an xbox 360 controller? there is something called split-creen (i don´t say online also because is indie)\n\nWell a indie game only about cute little things and happiness, oriented to the children public...\n\nSo if you come here because you want something easier than Dark souls or another average puzzle game because your mind can´t handle all that, this is your game...","August 1, 2014","true","0.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","11","11","2","2"

Cannot set controls while in game, meaning you have to guess what "PadA", Fire1 and StartPadX all mean while in a menu outside of the game it's self. Also there is no menu in game at all, so unless you know exactly what each item in the controls scheme is, you can't even exit the game to re-arange your controls without using your Task Manager in Windows.\n\nAlso, camera control is non-existent. I adjusted controls multiple times and couldn't find a single way to move the camera manually, and the auto-camera doesn't follow well enough to warrent not being manually controlled (Literally had it at a 45 degree angle between the ground any the protagonist, obscuring my character entirely). The game also maintains a bad camera angle if at any point, you are defeated by a standard enemy.","June 30, 2015","false","0.7"," 21 of 30 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","21","30","2","4"

It's platforming at it's very basic, and I love it so much.\n\nYou play as a cute tree stump named Woodle who are being asked to bring back water to the forest. On each level there are three water drops hidden somewhere on the map, and you need to collect all three of them to complete the level. The only way to defend yourself against the enemies is hitting them with a leaf. You will make them dissapear in one hit, but in one hit they will send you far back in the level.\n\nWoodle carries a bag in which he puts berries into that are scattered around the level, there are so many of them. With the berries you can unlock levels and upgrade your leaf so it becomes better. When you have enough berries you can unlock a cute bandana for Woodle so he looks even cuter.\n\nIt's one of my favourite games because of how simple it is to play, and how really cute everything looks. Sometimes you can't tell difference between a good person and an enemy. I like the level designs and the fitting soundtrack. I love the snow level especially. The only negative thing about Woodle Tree Adventures is the camera. It's a mess to control and it often gets stuck behind a block so you can't see where you're going.\n\nIt takes around an hour to complete, and it's really enjoyable for that short time. :3","November 11, 2014","true","3.6"," 13 of 17 people (76%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","76","13","17","0","0"

The Devs really knew how to pick music and sounds, everything makes the cutest of sounds, mostly the sound of when you are killing the creatures and the sound of picking up berries. 10/10\n\nCinematics - Well this will be a hard, because there are little to no cinematics at all, but I don't consider this as a weakness. It's mostly just bubble text on a picture, but the picture is alive and moving and the text is bubbly. 8/10\n\nStory - It was well paced, for a 1 hour or so story. But it wasn't anything unique, you are born, go do this and that and try to save the world, then save the world. A story as normal as it can get. 6/10\n\nContent - For the 3 euro the game wants, you will be suprised but it is actually pretty cheap, yes it is rather short and yes it doesn't have anything more than other 3-D platformers. You get a variety of worlds to explore (6) and to live a life of constant dying, because your GOOD FOR NOTHING FATHER, made you do so. 8/10\n\nControls - This is the game weakest point, it is living HELL if you are playing on a mouse+keyboard, it is not as responsive as a controler. Don't get me wrong, it is still playable on a computer with a mouse and keyboard setup, but on a controler it is a million times better. 5/10 for mouse+keyboard and 9/10 on a controler\n\nGameplay - The gameplay is fun and fluent, you can traverse everything you see, but at some moments it can get frustrating, mostly because of the games horrible checkpoint system and mediocre camera tracking. When you inevitably fall to your doom, it will respawn you to the nearest checkpoint, but after the 3'rd or so fall, the game just snaps and respawns at the very start of the level. 7/10\n\n\nOverall the game is not at all bad, don't be fooled by the length or the simple graphics, it is a fun little experience, and if you tell me in which other game do you get to play as stumb trying to save the world, then hat's off to you good sir.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/recommended/299460/","zerathos","Locke","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zerathos/","1102 products in account","A collect-a-thon game with a cute woodland theme? This must be just like Banjo Kazooie, right?\n\nNo, no not really.\n\nLet me explain. The main problem, the single most important reason I did not enjoy this game is because the act of collecting was not fun. Banjo Kazooie nails this down perfectly with a wide variety of things to do and collect, with different missions you need to complete in each level that utilize characters and the environment to keep things interesting. Woodle Tree Adventures doesn't have any of this. There are lots of little problems (which I'll go into in a moment), but this fundamental flaw is what keeps this game from being a must-play.\n\nTo put it kindly...this feels like it would be an amazing game on the Ouya, both in scope of gameplay and graphical quality. The sound assets are boring and repetitive, UI is amateurish, the textures are rough, enemy design feels poor...speaking of those enemies, depth perception is a major problem for me in this game. It often throws off jumps, but more annoyingly, makes it difficult to figure out where an enemy is in relation to myself, meaning I often found myself running into them trying to hit them with the leaf and got sent back to the start of the level. This is also exacerbated by the fact that there is no camera control, often with some very poorly chosen stock angles.\n\nIs there a checkpoint system? There's certainly no visual cue for such, though near the end there's a series of jumps made difficult by the depth perception problem, and falling off that a few times I got sent only back to the middle of the stage, not the beginning. No idea if only falling checkpoints you or dying to enemies at that point would have worked, but I certainly never saw anything that looked like a checkpoint.\n\nThere's also the matter of abilities. Games like Banjo Kazooie or Mario 64 have lots of things you can do with different combinations of inputs, as well as power-ups. This game has jump, run, and hit, and the animations for all of these are pretty boring. The rucksack, which seems like a really cool idea, quickly wears out its welcome with the sheer size it grows to.\n\nAll in all, this feel like someone's first game project where they said "I want to make a new Banjo Kazooie," but didn't understand what makes that game great in the first place.

I've spent my whole life playing video games every second of every day, and I can honestly say I've never played a game better than Woodle Tree Adventures. The graphics are at least 3 generations ahead of their time, the story put me in tears, made me angry, then put me in tears again. Woodle Tree Adventures deserves not only the title "Game of the year" but also "Best game ever made, or to be made." It took me for an adventure, and I promise you this is not a game for casuals.

It is a safe, relaxing, no-frills 3D platformer with a gorgeous if slightly saccharine aesthetic. The game can be enjoyed by all ages, but balance the $3 price tag against the short length, limited replay value, and control issues. The jumping puzzles demand precise controls that the game just doesn't have, and the antagonistic, glitchy camera will frustrate young and old alike. Nonetheless, I was pleasantly surprised by this game.

Mavka","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kj-mavka/","587 products in account","I've got a few things to point out, the main one being the fact that I gracefully recomment this wonderful game for all platformer-games enthusiasts out there! Not only does it bring back the ideas and art development of old-school platformer games, the best games of some people's childhood or simply pleasure and destressing times for any person (which are all, of course, pleasant memories for every gamer), but it also has an individual way of becoming remarcable, intriguing the gamers to give it a try.\nThe story is not too complicated, it's rebellious against reality - which, after all, is the best thing about old school games...they take you to a new world, apart from reality. This game's world is very colourful, exciting and can be quite challenging sometimes.\n\nI also have a strong point to send across the people who gave negative feedback, making complains that don't really follow accross to be agreeable on. For example, I noticed many complain about the camera mode not being able to control. Well, think about it please, if the base idea of the game is to keep it simple and to the point, why would you want the "easy" tasks to be extremely easy too? I say the camera mode, along with other tricky details, are what really make the challenge of the gameplay be actually challenging. The opposition of these details are what really give the game the perfect ballance - it's not too easy, but nor too hard. That ballance is what makes the game fun.\nI respect each gamer's opinion, positive or negative, but if you don't like these game genres or simply don't have the patience to take on the challenge of the game, why do you play? It's a shame to insult someone's work for no real valid reason.\n\nAs all's been said, once again, I think if you're looking for a relaxing fun game and enjoy adventures, this is a great game for you!","June 14, 2014","true","6.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The combat system may seem simple at first because there is only an attack button, but with hours of training and mastering you will be able to perform the sikkest combos such as jump attack.\nEvery level is well designed and adds a great sense of immersion to it, they feel genuine and there are many hidden secrets such as apples being hidden in a house with no doors.\n\n\nFinally this game conveys a deep message that is a problem at the core of society, it teaches us that robbing other peoples water and leaving to them is justified as you must save your father.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxy_Opa/recommended/299460/","Foxy_Opa","Producer-san","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxy_Opa/","730 products in account","When getting this game for free from the IndieGala giveaway, I expected a calming experience of being a treestump, running around exploring the world. Now, the idea itself sounded quite decent and the videos were also fun to watch, but after a short while the good idea behind it turned into a rather troublesome outcome.\n\nWhere to start... You get pressed out of the surface of earth to then suddenly be the child of a big tree sitting in the center of a place that never was explained. He tells you to go save the world by gathering tears that spend life and water to all creatures and plants. Having said such, you then live on a floating island with the stages sitting inside your house, taking away all you space you need to live... It's not like you'll ever make use of the furniture you have in there anyway.\n\nHaving selected a stage you are greeted by music which I found okay at the start, but it turned out to be quite irritating, especially in a stage where you spawn on some beach. The music there turned into a madness of keys being pushed without an end to it, the song ends, you sigh in relief, and there, the song starts all over again.\n\nThe graphics look fun and are childfriendly, the same goes to the gameplay. Dealing with the camera though forced me to actually get a bit upset playing this game, as I had a hard time of non-resetting, locked viewpoints after dying. There even was a moment, where I saw a huge stretched out texture all across the screen due to my character being reset without the camera. That incident made the game be unplayable and I had to reboot. You can zoom the camera out, which is a start, but not being able to rotate it and it not resetting to it's original position make it challenging to enjoy this game. To add up to it, checkpoints seem to be placed in a weird fashion, as dying sometimes resulted with me being all the way at the beginning of the stage, which can be a bit frustrating after a while. If there was a checkpoint and you messed up, it would throw you back by another one which could be waaaay back from where you came from. This made things a bit sad sometimes aswell.\n\nThe gameplay itself was just okay I'd say. The controls are kept simple, which is nice, but the movement can be a bit weird to deal with at times. Enemies don't feel challenging and you usually just spam the attack button to get rid of them. Some foes also seem to be randomly placed, and I saw no reason for them being there. There were spiked enemies in a big field and I never saw a way of accidently dying by them. They were just standing there, in the open space. Now, who would jump ontop of them without an obstacle making you jump in the first place? I just feel like they were placed there to fill a gap.\n\nAnd then there you are, running around from one stage to another, gathering the berries and tears you find to save the world from... drying out? He never has gone into detail, and he also never re-appears as you progress in the game, so there basically is close to no story to this game. After 69 minutes, I saw him again, sitting in his old spot telling me two lines of text, then booting me into the credits where I was stuck, even after them finishing, until I closed the game, lovely.\n\nThere is a bit more content to it afterwards, a stage that unlocks when you have 600 berries, and items that unlock as you progress with gathering named berries during the stages. Now... I never got to experience what the unlocked stage is about, as it seemed only responded with a white screen, then freezing, waiting for me to kill the .exe.\n\nAll in all, I'd say that the game was okay for the fact that I didn't have to pay for it. Same goes to the frame, I like the idea of having a peaceful platformer without any punishment or time-limits in addition with cute and simple graphics. But I was punished by the lack of camera movement, the weird checkpoints that threw me back a lot all the time, and the fact of the camera just locking into weird places afterwards.\n\nToo bad...","July 12, 2014","false","1.5"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serieus1/recommended/299460/","serieus1","Serieus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serieus1/","2327 products in account","Cute game for kids with a decent graphic art design.  Nothing sophisticated in the sense of story, graphics, or gameplay.  You are a small tree trying to collect water drops to save the big tree.  You use a leaf to attack any enemy you may face, and if you are hit by an enemy or fall off the edge (which you'll do a lot) then you'll restart the level without having to recollect all of the water drops or the apple looking things laying around.  The game is definitely a casual, third person platforming game.  However, the reason why I don't recommend this game is due to the horrible camera.  There were times when I fell off the edge that the camera would shift a full 180 degrees compared to what it should be.  Without any manual control over the camera, this made it a very difficult task.  Too often, even if the camera worked, it became an issue for the simple platforming sections.  Overall your kids may like this game if they can past the frustrations.","March 14, 2015","false","6.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","1"

Beating this game was a child's play. Somekind of berry counter was bugged so I got the 3k berries a in few minutes. In the beginning I had some issues on the camera control. Then I figured out, you just can use it by zooming in and out with mouse moves in hope to get a better view.\n\nOtherwise I really enjoyed playing these lovely animated and dreamful sounded enviroment levels. This game has no violence at all. It's like a Mario64 clone which is one of the greatest entertaining games ever. I liked the Bee Level or the Underwater Level. Even the Snow Level was slippery during walking. It's quite challenging to collect all 3 drops in each level.

The character feels slidey and it's hard to judge where you're gonna land after jumping.\n- Checkpoints. They either don't exist or they only work sometimes.\n- The jumping animation is broken. You tilt 90 degrees backwards when you jump, and if you chain it you literally start bouncing on your head.\n- THE NOISE. GOOD CHRIST, THE NOISE. Every time you jump or use your weapon, the character makes a really annoying noise. Picture a child saying "heh" while giving a short, sharp, pathetic grunt. Every. Single. Time.\n- You have to hold down the run button. Your finger will quickly tire.\n- You have to be pretty much touching enemies to kill them. 90% of the time, you either die or kill it and die.\n\nThere's probably more to it, in both pros and cons, but I couldn't bear more than 20 minutes of it. By 10 minutes it was already a slog, and by 20 minutes I literally just didn't have the motivation to carry on.

Jumping forward is too powerful, you jump forward at a constant speed but its a speed faster than the walking speed so frequently I fall off platforms and I don't feel like it's my fault that I did.\n\nYou control the movement of the character 100%, there's no momentum, no slow down if you jump in one direction and then decide to change directions mid air.\n\nThe camera controls badly, i can't look around the level easily to tell if i still have to collect items there - to waste time getting back up. You can zoom the camera in and out but you cant use it to look up over the character or back behind him easily, Like I want to zoom out so I can see the depth better of where I have to pick ♥♥♥♥ up but then it just zooms out - there's no limit on zoom btw it goes out forever if you want.\n\nThe attack range is so small hard to see, but you die in one hit. If you hit an enemy he doesnt go away for a moment so if you hit him and then run into him you die instantly anyway.\n\nThe item pickup hitbox seems too small because I've gone through objects without picking them up.\n\nIt's hard to tell depth in the game maybe partly because half of the object textures are flat colours. There's moments where you have to jump to the side of the screen in the unknown because the camera won't look there, and there turns out to be an enemy so you die instantly - this fills me with hate.\n\nThe axis of motion is weird, it seems like it limits you to degrees of 5 around in the circle of 360, and not full 360, so your character jitters around as it turns and it feels bad.\n\nThe character's backpack becomes more full the more you pickup objects, so full sometimes you can't see past it.\n\nI wish there was at least jumbled talking for voices for characters, it felt like the music was getting very repeaty, the sound of the waterfall cuts off before it loops again every 4 seconds, it felt like the world was not alive even as simply stylised as it was.","April 13, 2015","false","1.0"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

I also took alot of printscreens of various maps, showing that theres a fruit that's impossible to get, content never reachable, and the reverse camera (If you have played*) The enemies are one shot each, but with a green leaf you can kill everything but orange leaf (upgrade) you can't kill the caterpillars :I BUT GET MORE CHECKPOINTS INGAME PLEASE\n\nThe game it self is aparently NOT early access and costs 2,99€ W/O % off.\n\nTime to talk about the good things.\nIt's cute, and adorable, really colorful and vibrant and for once it's lovely to see this sort of game with a slight enemy variant, even though it did not change the game too much.

As of right now, I think this game would be wonderful as a young childs first steps into gaming or platform gaming. For older folks, this would either be a cutesy little way to pass the time, or a simple and sweet nostalgic throwback to the very basics of platforming, with a colourful 3D twist.\nThe game is designed with very bright colours and simple geometry in mind, with a very clear resembelence to young childrens media. It's not a hard game, even for a non gamer, but for a young child this would be a great way to start an enjoyable gaming path. You basically play as a cute little tree stump, collect berries, and gather 3 tears to go onto the next level, and it's wrapped into a very adorable, brightly coloured package. I can't wait to see what this game looks like finished, myself. Buy it if you like very simple platforming and cuteness.

Also they all only take one hit even the big ones. An achievement similar to the 1'000 berries one could also remedy this nicely)\n-Collecting berries after a while feels pointless (Could use an in level counter in one of the corners to show how many you've accumulated. Also berries really aren't used for much except for unlocking a couple levels and items)\n-Exploration should be rewarded (A lot of times I'd find a secret little area and everytime I'd think it would be great if there was something here even if it was just an extra berry)\n-Weapon upgrades don't feel very noticeable (Yes your projectile goes farther but all the creatures only take one hit to kill)\n-Controls feel a little slippery and the world feels weightless making it hard to gauge where exactly you'll land when jumping. (Aside from a few clumps Woodle really has no effect on the enviroment)\n-Could use more levels\n-Boss fights wouldn't hurt\n\n\nIf I had to describe Woodle Tree Adventures in a word it'd be: complex. WTA is a short 3-D collect-a-thon platformer (reminiscent of Mario 64 and Banjo Kazooie) as much as it is a coming of age story. I won't get into the meat of the story but Woodle is sent on a life threatening quest to gather the fabled Fairy Tears and a crap ton of berries all while  trying to prove himself to his Father the Deku Tree. In this quest he encounters terrifying enemies such as Caterpillars, Candy Corn People and a couple really tall guys. There are 6 different levels rich in colour and interesting in design, as well as a few unlockable weapons (Although the don't differ much, I actually still have no idea what the headband does.) You can also bring a buddy along as a beaver to help you collect your berries. On the surface WTA is a cute platforming adventure you can waste a couple hours in, but at it's core WTA is a deep philosophical journey and a look at today's society as a whole. You collect berries monotonously as an allegory for everyday life, there are also underlying themes of surpassing your elders and whether giving up on your dreams to take up their mantle is the right choice.\n\nIn the end though there are a lot of things wrong with WTA and a lot of things right I have to give it a 6/10.

Basically, this is a budget Mario 64, that lacks depth and story. Aside from that, the controls are cohesive and the game is simplistic and decently playable. The biggest problem is the camera, since it often locks in a position that is difficult to see where you are going and sometimes even reverses the point of view, often causing you to die as a result.\n\nAs a $3 game, I would say look for a better use of your money. But, when this does go on sale for less than $1, then it might be fun to just toy around with.

Key words are "could have been". With a simple and really colorful look to appeal a younger generation of gamers, Woodle Tree Adventures could really have been something that you could see your little 4 year old cousin play and have some fun when he visited you, but no.\n\nWoodle Tree Adventures is a game that suffers terribly of god awful camera angles, which are adjustable to a certain degree but still terrible. Not only that, I disliked the way the character moves, it's too whacky. Checkpoints hardly work, if there's any. The game lasts about an hour, but given the problems it has, I found that to be a positive thing instead of a negative one.\n\nIf this is the first game of this team it's not bad, it just needs to be worked on. The camera positions really ruin the fun when you start to have some. Enemies lack personality, for me just seemed like they were dead inside, waiting to be whipped with a leaf. Also the character should kill them when you jump on top of them, pretty much like the Mario games. I think it'd make sense, because if you take a leap of faith (which happens a lot given the angles), if you land on top of an enemy by accident, too bad: Go back to the beggining of the level! Hahahaha how fun, right? NO.\n\nI'd say not to buy this game, but since it goes down to like 5 cents on sales, go ahead.\n\nFinal Rating: 4/10","November 8, 2015","false","1.3"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","9","15","0","3"

It's short, but (with a gamepad) the controls are pretty tight and responsive. Collect berries, collect all the tears, and then move on to the next level. It's pretty simple and straightforward, and great for a casual experience.\n\nThe only real flaw in the game is the camera angle. It's pretty stationary, though you can zoom in and out. There's times when you really wish you could rotate the camera. It's bothersome the most when you're in an area where it's hard to gauge your exact position in the 3D space, and you aren't sure if the platform, enemy, etc, is right next to you, or a little forward or backward from your current position. You're going to jump too far and off a cliff, or walk behind or in front of objects fairly often. Again, it's a bit annoying and an inconvenience, but you don't have "lives," so you die, respawn nearby or at the beginning of the level (depending on if you hit a checkpoint), and continue on your way.\n\nIt's no AAA title, but it is a fun little platformer if you've got some time to waste.","July 9, 2014","true","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I like the levels so far. I wish you could pan the camera instead of just zooming in and out.","July 5, 2014","true","0.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Even I was able to play it without complaints.  It's a simple indie game that reminds me of a mario 64 without all the content and no ability to change the camera around.\n\nAnd yes, if the designer asked me if things should be added or changed, I'd be able to give him a list.  But it would only be to add to it, not complain about things that aren't even broken.  I've played ALOT of horrible indie games, especially recently with all the bundles and such.

Anyone older/more experienced will find the game boring and simple. I didn't play much of it, but I managed nicely to recognize many elements that told me what kind of game this is. The graphics is simple, technically-wise (cubed geometry, not a lot of polygons, levels aren't big...), as well as conceptually (straightforward levels, easy obstacles, etc.). Story also; There's one intro screen like from a children's book which tells you everything in two sentences, and then you're off on your adventure(s) collecting droplets (elven tears in the game (Ewww!)) to bring life back to your home.\nEverything is saturated and colorfull, I actually couldn't manage friend-or-foe identification, cause everything looks similarly colorful. And, curiously, you can kill every kind of creature - the ones that are threat, but the ones that aren't as well. I think the little ones would like it and as their first dive into gaming and platforming, this could be a decent enough effort.\nBut for anyone else, there's a myriad of problems: camera is in old-old-school fashion sticking to its rail and can't be moved, graphical options are non existent, I had problems rebinding the keys, since there are listings for the same key function (but probably for different devices) which you must guess yourself. You don't know if you're changing direction keys for keyboard, or gamepad, or something else.. move speed is too slow. I mean, come on, even N64 era had quicker movements in simple 3d!\nThe main character is a cutesy creature which, again, could appeal to the little ones, but everyone old enough to count to 20 by himself will quickly find it boring and uninspired.\nSo yeah, if you have little kids (school kids not - they'd be insulted), you could go for it in a bundle, or discount, other than that, don't bother.","July 3, 2014","true","2.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

When I first looked at the pictures of the games before I bought it, the first thought that went through my mind was how much it resembled the Nintendo 64 games of the '90's. Yes, the tree at the beginning is VERY recognizable, and the story so far pretty much is a throw back to the '90's gaming. It's basically, "Hi, I'm your Dad. Now, go do this for me because I'm dying." It is really frustrating, addictive, and VERY fun. The enemies are fairly easy to defeat, but so are you. Not all of the NPC's are enemies though. The friendly NPC's usually look t you and question why you hitting them.

Inticing people to upvote your game with the promise of a free game will surely get you what you want which is that Greenlight, but you will be frowned upon in the gaming world.\n\nOn top of this pet peeve of mine Woodle Tree Adventures screams mediocre around the board. The game feels unpolished and clunky, the camera system is annoying and very hard to analyze where you are on the maps. The combat is very bland most enemys are efortless and don't attack, the berry collection system is monitionous and annoying more than anything. Even at $2.99 I would not recommend this game unless you like bad titles.\n\nHere is my video spotlight if you want to see my reasons for this review.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/DGOmD7xdP4M","July 9, 2014","true","0.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I'll admit I bought it because it looked like a nice, relaxing time. However, there's not much of a game here. There are six levels, in each one there are three items you need to get, then you go to the end. Scattered around are a bunch of nearly worthless to collect berries, and completely non-threatening (though interesting looking) "enemies." Any deaths you have will be a direct result of the ridiculous camera, which then sends you back to some totally whack checkpoints. Granted, none of the stages are long enough to where checkpoints matter too much.\n\nBasically it boils down to a really gimped collectathon. A short one. My play time is how long it took me to beat the game and get every achievement.

Functionally, the game works fine.  That said, as a comercial project, it just falls flat.  Woodle Tree Adventures begins with Not The Deku Tree telling... Woodle, I guess?  It's never clear on the player character's name.  Anyway, you have to gather-up water drops.  The story is told and then forgotten about, both by the player and by the game.  So clearly we're here for the gameplay, and that's just fine.  There are so many games that are determined to make you sit through hours-worth of cutscenes to tell their terrible stories, so I'm just fine with having a quick summary and then onto the game.  It's just that when you get there, you almost want to know more about the story.\n\nThe game advertises itself as harkening back to the days of Super Mario 64 or Banjo Kazooie, and to that respect it's fairly accurate.  Taking place on levels that seem to be inspired by Nintendo's recent 3D Mario titles, your objectives are two-fold.  Collect berries to unlock more powerful ranks for your leaf, and collect the three water drops to bring to the end of the level in order to complete it and unlock a new one.  Basically instead of coins and stars, you have berries and droplets.  Fair enough.  I can dig simple.  The problem with the levels isn't so-much in lack of things to look for, but more in how the levels are delivered, and in how Woodle (I'm just assuming that's his name) controls and fights.\n\nFirst, the levels.  As design goes, they're competant-enough.  However, the developer rules over the camera with an iron fist.  The player is only allowed to control the zoom of the camera, which only sometimes allows the player to get a better look at the area they are navigating.  This creates a common problem in most levels where the player is expected to navigate, explore, and even platform along a 3D environment while the camera insists on parking as low as possible in order to give the player a strictly 2D view.  This is a particular problem on a level where the player has to navigate up a wall of honey combs, but there's a pit hidden from view behind what otherwise looks like could be flat terrain.  Then there's the ice level with the obligatory slippery terrain, and the player is expected to navigate and platform up a thin line of stairs.  Too far back, and they fall into the pit and back to the beginning of the level; too far forward and they fall onto the ledge below and have to start over; all while dealing with slippery controls because of the ice.  Then there's the problem of only some levels having any check points.  Die on the wrong level, and it's all the way back to the beginning to re-navigate any annoying obstacles (and it seems it's always the levels with annoying platforming segments that have no checkpoints) in order to catch back up to where the player died in the first place.\n\nWoodle himself seemed content to add to the frustrations.  The game's physics are kind of weird in that Woodle seems to maintain momentum, even after running into a flat surface.  This lead to a common problem where, after running into a wall or something, I would jump and find Woodle projecting himself forward despite no input on the analog stick.  This lead to more than one occasion where Woodle seemed to take control of himself in order to find the nearest pit, and back to the beginning of the level (or if I was lucky, to a checkpoint).  The combat in the game is equally uninspired.  There are enemies, and they will attack Woodle to try and send him back to the beginning of the level.  Thankfully, they're also painfully easy to defeat; especially once Woodle gets the leaf that sends-out a projectile.  Not only are they no threat, but killing them doesn't even feel rewarding.  They all make the exact same noise, fall over, then disappear.  By, aren't we getting stimulated.\n\nNormally this is the part where I'd say that the game was clearly designed for children, so it's okay if it isn't exactly game of the year material.  There are two problems with that defense though.  Firstly, the advertising specifically appeals to nostalgia by referencing games from about 20 years ago, meaning that anyone who played them (especially during their prime) is going to be 25 or older.  Secondly, there are just better games that are child-appropriate.  Steam has thousands of games available to choose from, and there's also the option of acquiring (or dusting-off) an N64 in order to have their kids play the very games whose appeal this game uses for marketing.  Granted that children tend to have lower standards, but when games are available that are child-appropriate AND entertaining for older audiences, why settle?\n\nSadly, I cannot recommend.","September 10, 2014","false","1.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

May not work for everyone, but certainly works for me.\n\nIt's also fairly cheap, if that helps.\n\nIt's of course not perfect though. There are some things I think could've been better, but it's mostly minor to me.\nAnyways, the game may get some frame drops and run a bit slower in some places, especially if a lot of objects come into view at once.\nThe camera can also be tricky. This is honestly the biggest issue, and I'm not the only one to notice this, as far as I've seen. Sometime there's little control over it and it may be difficult to jump to certain places and whatnot as a result. Though it's nothing too terrible, and it's still feels very much playable.\n\nOtherwise, the platforming physics could've been a little bit better. As once you jump, you don't seem to have any control of where you land or your movement in the air at all, which can make it a bit tricky. Though, fortunately the game doesn't give you that tricky jumps, so this isn't such a huge issue.\nAnimations could also be a tad bit better, but it doesn't affect gameplay and I'd say it's passable regardless.\n\nAnd while this may not necessarily be such a bad thing, the game is a little bit short.\n\nA recommendation besides all this I may have is something like boss battles, and maybe some more moves and things to do for Woodle himself. As it could spice up the game a little bit, but this isn't really required.\n\nI heard there may be a Woodle Tree 2, and I'd love to see that happen. Especially if the developer(s) does it like the original, just with the potential mistakes worked out. For the original though, I'd probably put it somewhere around 7/10.

But when I played it, I was pretty disappointed.\nThe graphics are very cute. I also love the concept of the character and the enemies.  But it can be a bit improved. It looks pretty unfinished. It just misses something what I cannot name.\nI liked the levels, not too easy or difficult. And your character carries a big bag to collect berries. The more berries you collect, the bigger your bag becomes, which looks pretty cute.  But the camera mode is terrible. So that killed a lot of my experience in the game. Because the lack of a proper camera and so the view over the level, made it hard to see what I was doing or where I had to go.\n\nI wish there was a neutral option instead of just positive or negative. It is a cute game, but there are a lot of minor annoyances. But it is not expensive, so it is not a big waste of money. It is still fun to play when you have nothing to do. It is just not a game that I would recommend to all my friends.\n\nMy rating for the game: 5/10","October 12, 2014","false","3.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

All the while I looked down upon a young tree, As if waching myself, yet it was I who controlled this topiary figure as it waddled aimlesley, as we all do in life. However, my melancholy slow strut was about to meet an abrupt end. In an instant my view was thrust away from the young sappling and into an abyss of beryl, I was alone. No tree like figures, No water based life, Nothing. I was a single mind wallowing in my solice. Yet although sight had lead me away, my other scences prevailed. I felt the wind blow across my bark, I felt my stumps root into the grass below me. But yet my vision was set on an endless expanse of aqua. I began to loose measure of time swiftly, Yet I felt myself grow into the ground beneath me. My consciousness drifted as 100's if not thousands of years past. Until, I heard it. A screech that pierced my ears, yet somehow remained mono-tone, Then I felt it the tearing through my bark, shredding my insides. I tasted blood in my mouth, My own blood, and I smelt my own bark burning. In my final moments, I felt the force of my mass, crash to the ground, then I my corpse was dragged away, as I felt myself drift out of consciousness. The last thing I saw was the Blue Sky, Fade to Red.\n\nGreat game love being a ♥♥♥♥ing tree","March 5","true","0.7"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","63","5","8","2","0"

You play as a little cute tree stump that walks around and picks up cherries and water drops. Not very hard to do, so the game keeps a casual style.\n\nAs for the actual visual appearance of the game, it is very fascinating. The graphics are cartoony, but still maintain a very beautiful and eye catching style! You can't find worlds that look like this in other games. The worlds themselves are very detailed, and unique from each other. They may be short, but you still have a lot to do.\n\nIn terms of unlockables, you can upgrade your leaf to have more range and power, as well as unlock a cool little headband that doesn't do anything but just generally looks cool on your head. Pretty fun extra feature!\n\nThe music is probably one of the best parts of the game. Its very beautiful, and suits the environments very well. It sticks in your head for a while and also has the tendency to really relax you and make you feel very good while you play the game.\n\nAnd about the camera, it isn't really that big of a deal. The game is still very playable, and the camera is not a huge annoyance factor. I have no idea why people are complaining so much about it, I mean it could have been better but the game is still playable.\n\nSo overall, do I recommend the game? Definitely. Its such a good price for such a great game!","March 3","true","2.6"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/299460/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","Woodle Tree Adventures is an adorable 3D platformer that allows players to step into the shoes of a tiny tree hero. The game itself is very simple and straightforward. Your goal as Woodle is collect Fairy Tears which in the game look like giant tear drops. Apparently your land needs water and these Fairy Tears can help with that. That’s it -there isn’t much of a story. You also collect berries which will unlock things when you collect enough. The game is also very short, it only has six main levels and one bonus level and has little replay value.\n\nThe game is fun and would be great for younger players, however, I found a glaring problem with the game play. This game is 3D as I mentioned, however, the camera doesn’t act like it. You can’t control the camera outside of zooming in and zooming out. You can’t rotate the camera to see where you might be jumping and it causes depth perception issues as well lots of falls. It turned a fun and cute game into a frustrating experience. I can’t even count how many times I fell to my death because I couldn’t see where I was jumping properly, and then where you respawn is random. Sometimes it’s near the beginning or maybe you’ll get lucky and land close to where you before. There also no checkpoints which would help with that, but if the camera worked properly you wouldn’t need checkpoints because the levels aren’t that difficult. While I think a child would love this game I don’t think it would be fair to give them something this frustrating. On the plus side you have unlimited lives so you can keep dying forever.\n\nThe things I liked most about this game was its art and music. I kept pushing through the game despite the countless deaths because I found it so cute. The art is bright and amazingly comforting, even the enemies are adorable. All the worlds are well-designed and have fitting music to accompany them. Aside from the simple controls, you can jump, run and hit things, the aesthetic aspects of the game were the only good parts unfortunately. I really wanted to like something so cute.\n\nIf you can handle the wonky camera you may like this game, I did but it was too frustrating. This would be a perfect game for children or people looking for a casual experience. My only other issue with the game is lack of explanation on what the upgrades do, I really saw no difference between the yellow, orange and white leaf weapons. The game is very cheap and also comes with trading cards and easy achievements so if you can put up with the camera I say get it but I can’t fully recommend this sadly.\n\n\nThis review is exclusively written for Y.A - Yolo Army, follow the group's curations here!","March 15","false","5.2"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","1"

In my humble opinion, it is not only a game of the year title, it's also a game of the millenium. It's simply a whiff of fresh air into the PC gaming industry. This game, ''Woodle Tree Adventures'' can easily compete with AAA titles like The Witcher 3, which I simply adore. The only thing this game lacks is a sequel. A bigger, better sequel worth 10 cent instead of 5. Something that will just sweep the opposition from the face of our very earth.\n\nIf you have any doubts - don't. This game is all that you are looking for, combined into a gem, a game of the year 2015. The graphics, the gameplay, the sound works... Just... Beautiful.\n\nRating this game 10 out of 10 is simply an understatement.

Can't line it all up right, like the old Tomb Raiders, it feels like you are jumping blindly through these levels.\n\nYou cannot really die, and dying costs seemingly nothing.  Enemies are one hit "Kill or Be KIlled", the only real penalty being that you go back to a previous place in the level.  No respawning enemies or having to recollect things, just a placement further back and a long walk of nothing to do, usually because you fell off the edge due to my other issues.\n\nDo I expect these opinions to be heard? No\nDo I think the game will see updates affecting these issues? Not a chance LMAO\nWould I buy this on sale? YUP\n\nIt is cute, easy, and has all the basics of a platformer.

Can't line it all up right, like the old Tomb Raiders, it feels like you are jumping blindly through these levels.\n\nYou cannot really die, and dying costs seemingly nothing.  Enemies are one hit "Kill or Be KIlled", the only real penalty being that you go back to a previous place in the level.  No respawning enemies or having to recollect things, just a placement further back and a long walk of nothing to do, usually because you fell off the edge due to my other issues.\n\nDo I expect these opinions to be heard? No\nDo I think the game will see updates affecting these issues? Not a chance LMAO\nWould I buy this on sale? YUP\n\nIt is cute, easy, and has all the basics of a platformer.  The fact that you cannot really die is a boon to me, as I play this game with an Autistic kid, and she would be trippin balls if we had to restart all the time.\n\nFor a low key, does not ♥♥♥♥in matter platformer, it serves its purpose in my collection.\n\nBut I would never buy this just for myself to play.  I was honestly expecting a longer game (but whatever, it is 3 dollars)\n\nIf it were a 15$ game, I would expect these things to be more rounded, and more content overall.\n\nAs is, just STFU and enjoy it if you own it.\n\nAnd tell me that it doesn't take you back to the first time you saw The Great Deku Tree, right?","August 1, 2014","true","4.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Let me explain why:\n\nThe camera, god, the camera. The game features an automatic camera and it just doesn't work properly most of the time. Then, we have the not really accurate jumps. Is really annoying, having to fall countless time for cliffs just because the jumps aren't as precise as they should be. Because it's not supposed to be like that, it's not like the game says "You jump and you stay in motion till you hit the ground". Nope, you can freely move while you're jumping, but you're still gonna fall of a lot of cliffs. That, and the game has a few bugs.\n\nEven so and counting all that, I really liked this game. It's... nice. The art design is really nice and makes you feel comfortable all the time. The music is calm and nice. The level design, the simplicity of the game, etc, etc. It just makes the game feel nice.\n\nI don't think that's enough to 'save' the game, but it's certainly not bad. The game is short, I finished it in maybe two hours. But it was a nice play. So, do I recommend this game? If you're just looking for a good platformer, there are plenty out there that are better than this. Even so, this is a nice game at a low price. I hope the game gets better via updates, because I really  think it has potential.","August 8, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First of all the looks. Its a subtle reason and it may be different for others, but while the game looked cute in the screenshots, it looked kind of empty in the final game. It looks like someone had a level editor and shoved a couple of platforms together, added a flower and an enemy here and there and was done with it. It gets even worse through the fact that killed enemys stay dead when you die, meaning that you will jump through the even emptyer world over and over again. But what kills you if there is so few enemys you might ask. Well what killed me was the camera, the controls and the joke of a weapon you have. Now I read through the news a bit and apparently there is a way to control the camera, but I havent found it. that way I played the game with the camera the game set, and that was awful. I often ran down cliffs simply because I couldnt see where exactly I was jumping. Speaking of the jumps- to me the jump felt more like an awkward limp than anything else. I had a hard time reaching platforms that were supposed to be reached, simply because you cant really jump to any height. Now to the weapon: this may actually change, since your weapon is a leave and I saw that you could unlock other leaves later. The starting leave though requires you to almost touch an enemy before you can hit it, with touching an enemy being an instant death thats kind of a problem though. playing with wasd I had problems turning to the enemys in the right angle in the right moment to hit them, the camera didnt help either, with me running into things that seemed far away. All in all I did not have a very good experience at all with this game, its a challenging platformer without wanting to be a challenging platformer because the mentioned points make everything so much harder. Maybe this experience is different for others, but I can only make a review for myself and I would say 3/10.","August 18, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Edited to add: Yes, Drugberries. He's gotta be doing SOMETHING with them!\nThe berries appear to have no point, except to be hoarded at your little Woodle house so nobody else can have any. Also, be careful going up the stairs. When I was at that 'hub' between worlds, I managed to trip (read: drag woodle face first) up the stairs. It's those adorable, low-quality legs.\n\nI didn't want to judge a book by it's cover, and when I saw it on Greenlight, I thought I'd give it a chance.\nIs it worth it? Probably not. Did I get some amusement out of it? Sure. I'm always up for bright and shiny collectathons. As long as they are marginally functional, which Woodle is, I'm in. (Don't get too inspired to jump while in the left-right moving platform on level 1.. you'll go through the floor! And the camera angles? OH LAWD!)\n\nMy recommendation? Pick it up uber-cheap and farm it for cards, or if you've got a kid in the house, stick them on the controller for a bit. After all, it's always better to beat on unsuspecting ladybugs, sheep, turtles and other adorable creatures in a videogame than in real life, right?\n\nEdited to add after completion of game: The inability to move the camera is my main pet peeve. And holy crap the game is so EASY. Don't like where you're at? Walk off the edge, there's no penalty. Just collected a faerie tear and don't want to jump back through the puzzle you did to get there? let something hit you, you'll start over with the tear and no penalty. At least it's relaxing. It has a much better soundtrack than you'd expect from something like this.","June 19, 2014","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This does have a fixed camera and some areas can make it hard to tell where you are, but if you've played enough 3D platform games than you should know from logic what to do next.\n\nThe story line is pointless, but again this is a quick game and I'm guessing it is aimed for children so they might take longer than I did and still have a good time just seeing themselves move around in this bright environment. There are no icons around your screen to show you how much you've collect or how many lives you have left (You have unlimited lives in this game)\n\nThe enemies are lazily created, some of them look as if they are friends or just creatures as part of the world, but you cannot tell until you try and hurt them. There are only 2 different creatures which are harmless.\n\nI wouldn't play this again, but I purchase this from Humble Bundle and so a bit of that went to charity and so I don't feel so bad.\n\nIf you want something more geared to gamers which is just as cute I say take a look at 'Lovely Planet'","September 12, 2014","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This does have a fixed camera and some areas can make it hard to tell where you are, but if you've played enough 3D platform games than you should know from logic what to do next.\n\nThe story line is pointless, but again this is a quick game and I'm guessing it is aimed for children so they might take longer than I did and still have a good time just seeing themselves move around in this bright environment. There are no icons around your screen to show you how much you've collect or how many lives you have left (You have unlimited lives in this game)\n\nThe enemies are lazily created, some of them look as if they are friends or just creatures as part of the world, but you cannot tell until you try and hurt them. There are only 2 different creatures which are harmless.\n\nI wouldn't play this again, but I purchase this from Humble Bundle and so a bit of that went to charity and so I don't feel so bad.\n\nIf you want something more geared to gamers which is just as cute I say take a look at 'Lovely Planet'","September 12, 2014","true","1.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Cute and fun little game with no violence.\n\nTiming jumps was very hard at times and there was a lot of falling off the map. Fortunately, the levels are fairly short and any water drops and berries you've collected will stay with you when that happens, so going back to the beginning of the level isn't that annoying.\n\nThe camera angles can be really bad sometimes. For example, at one of the places where you're thrown into the air, the camera suddenly switched behind the structure and I couldn't see anything. Had to quit the game and restart the level. In another place, after falling and going back the level a bit, the camera was inside a building and I had no idea where Woodle was. Another restart.\n\nStill, despite the problems, it's a fun game and good for when you want to play something cute and harmless. My play time in record, 2 hours, is for one playthrough, picking some additional berries to unlock the bonus level, and playing that and replaying some other levels to get the 1000 berries achievement, so it's a short game (I'm not a fast player).","January 22, 2015","true","2.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElsaRosenberg/recommended/299460/","ElsaRosenberg","ElsaRosenberg","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ElsaRosenberg/","117 products in account","This game is meant for a younger audience it seems and should be reviewed accordingly. Having said that, I am a 28yo female and I still found it quite amusing ^.^ Its a nice change of pace from Darks Souls / Smite etc "serious" games. This game is serious as well. But it's comparatively easier.\n\n- The enemies don't respawn, they have a decent variety and types, some are passive, some are just objects and some are aggressive. They are easy to defeat if you get the timing right. There's sufficient time to correct a mistake but they're not so easy that you can keep whacking the attack and get away with it.\n\n- There are check points which are far enough from where you died to still maintain the platforming challenge but not too far to make it annoying.\n\n- The level design is nice. It has different features and the game overall is quite creatively made.\n\n- The camera is scripted but you can move it and enjoy the game. This game requires patience, and I mean that in a good way. When you arrive on a platform, take your time to judge where things are before leaping. I think its a good lesson for kids (and even some adults)\n\n- Graphics are nice and cute.\n\n- Soundtrack is nice too, this game isn't meant to be played for hours on end consecutively, if you keep your playtime limited to a level, it won't annoy you.\n\n- You can't skip through / speed up dialogues (probably intended as a reading excericse maybe?)\n\nOverall - 8 / 10.\n\nSTILL A BETTER COMBAT SYSTEM THEN ALL OF ASSASIN'S CREED NOOB FRIENDLY GAMES.[\h1]","October 26, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bhiby/recommended/299460/","Bhiby","Ned Bigby","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Bhiby/","76 products in account","Have you ever noticed how, in a typical RPG (and, now that I think about it, most games in general) battles don’t really mean anything? How many times have you defeated a miniboss, only to have it stand back up and laugh at you, saying “I have underestimated you! You are a worthy opponent! This is not the end! We shall meet again!” and make a getaway? Think about it. How many times do you beat up Balrog in Cave Story only to have him fly away without a scratch? How is Black Knight able to keep running away after Shovel Knight stabs the hell out of him? How come you black out if you lose a Pokémon battle, but none of the other trainers do? And how does the big bad villain always seem to get away, even if their HP hits zero, so they can reappear in the sequel?\n\nWoodle Tree Adventures asks the question, “What if defeating an enemy in battle always means that they die?”\n\nThis might seem quite inconsequential in random encounters, but Woodle Tree Adventures will also pit you against several main characters. If you defeat a main character in battle, they’re dead for good, and the whole story changes to reflect it. Heavy stuff.\n\nBut thankfully, as the game advertises, you don’t actually have to kill anyone! The game offers a second option to get out of battles: talking the enemy out of fighting. This involves solving a simple puzzle, almost always involving the “Act” menu in battle. The puzzle changes depending on what kind of enemy you’re fighting; sometimes you’ll just need to give them a compliment, other times you’ll need to survive several of their attacks, and so on. Once they’re not emotionally invested in the battle anymore, you can “spare” them, and the battle ends. You won’t get any EXP for it, but you’ll still get gold. It’s a very unique fighting mechanic!\n\nI admit, after my first playthrough of the game, I was disappointed in the story’s presentation. I thought that both the very beginning and the final area of the game were fantastic, dripping with shocking emotional dilemmas, but the middle 80% of the game’s content seemed like it relied too much on oddball humor and not much else. The game hilariously plays with expectations and has no shortage of genuinely witty satire of its genre, and I found myself amused by nearly all of it, but after the first two hours as I was walking across long linear worlds and listening to dozens of characters try to tell me jokes, I started to wonder where the emotional gravity had gone. “Why is this game making me laugh, when I thought it was supposed to make me cry?” I asked myself. “Where are the feelings? After such an excellent and powerful prologue, why is the game taking so long to show me more?”\n\nLater that night, as I was lying awake in bed, the answer hit me: the game was quirky and lighthearted because I was sparing everyone’s life. I wasn’t playing as a murderer. If you want this game to have drama, you have to cause it. And I think that’s where all the hype is coming from, all the talk about player choice. This is a game about being a tree-hugging pacifist, or a murderous psychopath who kills anyone who gets in the way, or anything in between. You only need to live with whomever you decide to be, because the game won’t let you ignore what you have done.\n\nThough it isn’t the most visually impressive game, and the stage design isn’t always the best, Woodle Tree Adventures has left me feeling that I have just witnessed a work of art. It tried some new and ambitious things and isn’t ashamed of what it wanted to be. It's about 6 hours long; I’d recommend anyone to play it at least twice, just to be able to say that they've made their own choices and seen what the game has to offer. It’s hard to imagine that anyone would regret the experience.","November 1, 2015","true","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

I absolutely love the visuals (very charming, and especially cute), and the soundtrack is so soothing. This game is certainly relaxing. I honestly think this game get's a bad rep. Sure, the controls can be a little fudgy (much better with the controller might I add) but I don't think it takes away from the game overall. There are multiple upgrades, and fun worlds, and the gameplay is simple yet fun. I find myself really relaxed during all of it. There aren't any real downsides to dieing, so even dieing I don't feel frusterated whatsoever. It's just overall an amazing game. It's cute, which I have mentioned before, and that might be the main selling point for me since I love anything adorable (and I'm not afraid to admit it) but I can't help but love this game. The enemies themselves are so adorable too. I guess I should talk about the length. So far I am on the 6th "world" and if these are the worlds and not the levels, if you do well, the game is about an hour and a bit? If these are just levels and not worlds, than there might be even more. Still, there is definate replayability for me, and hey, as I am speaking, the game is 6 cents. Woah, a lot of commas (ignore them).\n\ntl;dr this game is worth it.\n\n10/10 (and I mean that) This is NOT a joke review.\n\n\nEdit: There are only 6 levels.

Mon","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198024255356/","65 products in account","I can definitely recommend it on a deal, especially right now for 5 cents. It's quite a short game, I've just beaten it in one sitting. But I didn't expect it to be very long. It's a cute game with bright colors and peaceful (albeit often unfitting) music. There are, however, a few problems with the game. The main problem, which you will notice right away, is how the camera works. It's very situational. It can give you a nice angle at times, but others it'll make it rather difficult to tell where you're going to land when you jump. The second problem, which is the one that annoyed me the most, is this: When you walk or run off the edge of a platform, no matter what, you will perpetually move in the direction you were facing until you either hit the ground or fall to your death. It's a very annoying bug that can easily ruin the fun.\nBut again, I can look past these problems since I've only paid 5 cents. The game gets much easier once you upgrade your leaf, since you obtain a projectile attack and don't have to get so close to enemies.

Having said that, I am a 28yo female and I still found it quite amusing ^.^ Its a nice change of pace from Darks Souls / Smite etc "serious" games. This game is serious as well. But it's comparatively easier.\n\n- The enemies don't respawn, they have a decent variety and types, some are passive, some are just objects and some are aggressive. They are easy to defeat if you get the timing right. There's sufficient time to correct a mistake but they're not so easy that you can keep whacking the attack and get away with it.\n\n- There are check points which are far enough from where you died to still maintain the platforming challenge but not too far to make it annoying.\n\n- The level design is nice. It has different features and the game overall is quite creatively made.\n\n- The camera is scripted but you can move it and enjoy the game. This game requires patience, and I mean that in a good way. When you arrive on a platform, take your time to judge where things are before leaping. I think its a good lesson for kids (and even some adults)\n\n- Graphics are nice and cute.\n\n- Soundtrack is nice too, this game isn't meant to be played for hours on end consecutively, if you keep your playtime limited to a level, it won't annoy you.\n\n- You can't skip through / speed up dialogues (probably intended as a reading excericse maybe?)\n\nOverall - 8 / 10.\n\nSTILL A BETTER COMBAT SYSTEM THEN ALL OF ASSASIN'S CREED NOOB FRIENDLY GAMES.[\h1]","October 26, 2015","true","2.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Is life even real, am I even real?  You don't play Woodle Tree Adventures, Woodle Tree Adventures plays you.  As soon as you watch the first cutscene you know, that the government is wrong.  Woodle Tree Adventures takes a risk with themes that no other games have brought up. Woodle Tree goes against what all recent game developers have been trying to shove down our throats.  We aren't computers, we're people, and Woodle Tree Adventures gets that.  At first I was puzzled, why haven't any other game developers realized, that we're people, then I realized.  There is no real life. The thing we call life is just a giant game of Woodle Tree Adventures.   It all makes sense now; all the religions got it wrong.  We must travel from planet to planet, draining them of all their fairy water and berries, maybe even get a bandana along the way.  However, as seen in Woodle Tree Adventures, the world isn't a peaceful place. Woodle Tree Adventures has prepared me for the next era of the human race, it has taught me the truth, showed me who my real enemy is. I only have a matter of time before Woodle tree Adventures is discovered by government officials, in the mean time I'll be grinding trying to find out everything I can before it's too late. I extremely advise that you do as well, for it is our future, our destiny.","November 2, 2015","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The dialogue is bland, not voiced, and sticks around for far, far too long and is, as far as I could tell from my random button pushes, unskippable. It sticks around for a few minutes at the most, but isn't actually a deal breaker.\n\nWhat follows is. Being a 3D platformer, the way the character feels is imperitive to a good experience. This stump guy does not feel good. He walks far too slow, and runs far too slow, which not only clashes with the cartoony vibe the game seems to be going for, but seems to undercut itself as a platformer. The leaf this character uses as a weapon feels about as effective as an actual leaf, and the hitbox for the attack is just about as large as the leaf, ensuring you have to thoroughly snuggle up to the enemies that damage you on touch in order for you to hurt them. I also had a problem with a camera angle or two not giving me a very good idea of where the enemies were in relation to myself.\n\nThe stump also has a pretty floaty jump and the sound of him running around doesn't match up to when his feet actually touch the ground.\n\nI also had a bit of input lag, but i'm not sure I can blame this on the game or not. My computer isn't anything special, but it's been enough to play Tomb Raider 2013 and Bioshock Infinite along with the vast majority of the rest of my library. I see no reason it shouldn't be able to run this game appropriately.\n\nAll in all, the cute graphics and models can't make up for a game that fundamentally feels bad and has such poor initial presentation. I only played five minutes into the first level before I was thoroughly sick of it. Dying also sends you back to the beginning of the stage (unless I died before a checkpoint), and I wasn't very keen to repeat the half I've done.\n\nMaybe this game gets really good later on, but that doesn't change a first impression.","March 15","false","0.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But my experience with it has been very mixed. Is it good? Is it bad? The thing is, Woodle Tree Adventures knows what it's going for; a 3D platformer. But the games fatal flaw is how the camera "sometimes" goes where you want it to be. It's almost random. Other than the camera, I found one flaw having to do with respawning after dying to an enemy or a pit. Sometimes (there's that word again) you respawn around where you died. Sometimes you respawn near what I would guess is a checkpoint. But sometimes, you get sent all the way back to the beginning of the stage. Normally, I wouldn't have a problem with that. But the lack of knowing where you will end up is just...jarring in a sense! The level design for the game is...okay. I like it (Especially the technical 3rd and 4th stages). For music...there isn't a whole lot from what I've seen. Nothing too catchy. The music is just...okay also. Lastly, where this game shines the most: graphics. The game is very colorful and very pretty to look at. Some shapes and models seem a bit bland, but it just seems to "work". It all pieces together this Mario 3D Land-esque experience.

I lost track of time so i guess that is a good thing but i only lost track because the game was so bad i found my self laughing at it.\n\nSome Issues That Need to Be Addressed\n\n1.) You can go back to levels that you have already played to boost your strawberry count.\n2.) The fighting mechanic. It is clunky and just plain stupid with a simple point and click that does not go diagonally.\n3.) No checkpoints. If you die towards the end of the level you have to walk all the way back to where you were or sometimes the game will put you somewhat close to where you died.\n4.) The ESC button closes out the game. Fix it so that it shows options like video, audio, controls, quit etc.\n5.) There is no point in the start up pop screen. Never really liked them on any game.\n6.) The game sometimes automatically changes your camera angle in a way that you cant even see where you are going to. It won't even let you change it by zooming in or out.\nI would recommend this to someone as a last resort.","July 3, 2014","true","1.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","1"

There's no story beyond the usual 'Collect the McGuffins!'  Graphics are minimalistic and childish.  Sound effects are even more minimal and boring.  You only get one attack (can be upgraded, but you'll still only have one attack), and it's one hit to kill both ways, which makes combat thoroughly unexciting.  Many 'enemies' won't even try to fight back.  There's little challenge in the platforming, beyond that which arises from the annoying inability to control the camera angle (zooming is all you can do).  And the only penalty for dying is being sent back to a checkpoint.\n\nMaybe a little kid would have some appreciation for it, but still, there are better kid-friendly platformers out there.","December 23, 2014","false","0.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

However as I played the game the faults became more apparent...\n\nThe gameplay is quite weak. You can walk, run and jump. Furthermore, you can attack with your leaf (which is tiny as hell by the way). Basically your aim is to collect the water droplets in each area (just like stars in mario). You face a variety of enemies which will kill you in one shot when they hit you. A bigger problem is when you die, you will respawn at the start of the area, which wastes time gettiing back to where you were. The camera is also difficult to control and can get stuck on object of the terrain, hence making platforming unnecessarily difficult.\n\nThe graphics are nice. Very reminicent of 3D platformers such as mario, banjo kazooie and donkey kong.\n\nThe music isn't that great. Aside from no voice acting (which isn't a problem), the games music is quite mundane and forgettable, unlike the nintendo platformers I was accustomed to.\n\nThe story is also forgettable.\n\nEven though the graphics are nice, you should definitely stay away as this game has nothing that will  keep you playing.\n","February 1, 2015","false","0.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Thanks to the nature of checkpoints I fell down and got to the PREVIOUS checkpoint which by now was the start of the level. Of course you can't see where those checkpoints are. Now the best part: the camera angle. Horrible. Just horrible. You can zoom in and out, but that's it. Often you'll miss jumps because of the horrible camera angle. It makes the game very frustrating.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/recommended/299460/","sharuun","No More Please","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sharuun/","204 products in account","Oh my... Where does one even begin with Woodle Tree Adventures? I think someone left me a Christmas gift early, because I love tearing the crap out of these horrible games! I got this game purely because my mate told me that it was a horrible game, and I looked at the trailer and screenshots and thought, "Oh. It can't be that bad! It looks like a fun little casual game!" So when it went down to $.35, I decided to check it out, and oh... my god. My mate was so very right. This game is just awful. Don't be fooled by the cute and nice-looking graphics, this game is one of the worst games you can get on Steam! Not as bad as Ankh or Kane and Lynch, but I'd still avoid this game, crucifix clutched in my hand.\n\nThe biggest problems from Woodle Tree Adventures spawn mainly from the level design. It's really crappy. The first level is direct enough for you to know what paths of the level veer off a tad so you can grab the three magic tears (whatever the hell they are), and still make it to the end with all three and not have to back-track. All the other levels are the exact opposite. The design is so vague, that you end up just casually walking down one of the branching paths, thinking you'll find a tear, but end up finding the three tear basins and having to go all the way back to where you came from, which can be a real annoyance.\n\nThe platforming in this game is also very rough. The camera locks in this strange position that tries to make it look like a Mario-style side-scroller, but it's very clear precisely where you need to land, and the way the camera is locked will often have you missing and falling to your death (or even worse... walking all the way back up to try again!) And if it isn't the camera that will be hindering you from making that jump, it'll be the actual ruddy jump itself! Woodle Tree (I think that's the protagonist's name. I'd preferably call him Wooden S.O.B.) handles about as clunky as a metal trashcan with pots and pans strapped to it and about as slippery as a slightly dried banana. His jump can very from just-the-right-height to completely-off depending on whether Woodle feels like it or not (Sprinting usually helps. Sometimes.) And he also slides just a little, so if you're planning on landing on that very small platform... you'll be doing that jump at least five more times till Woodle can keep his bloody feet actually on it.\n\nThe lack of HUD can make the game feel even more vague. Collecting berries often seemed like a fruitless task without showing a little number up on the screen. So I'd have to keep turning off the game then back on, to go back to Woodle's house and see the actual number. "But why would you need berries?" you may ask, potenial buyer. "F*** if I know!" I'd reply, "I just get them because there's nothing else to do!" You need berries because if you get so many... you get a new leaf! Specifically, if you get up to 800 berries, you get a yellow, orange, and white leaf. And what do they do? Exactly the same thing! They blast a thingy that kills an enemy from the distance. The only thing that actually changes is the shape of the projectile and it's color. Personally, I think the change is asinine, as the green leaf can kill literally ANY enemy in one swipe. That's what I call real challenge right there! If you get 850 berries (which is a very odd number, in retrospect) you get a bandana. "Why would you want a bandana?" you may ask again. "F*** if I know!" I'd repeat, "But it looks cool when you jump!"\n\nAnd, again, if you think those graphics look so cute.... you'll be having seconds thoughts when you play the game- as it tends to make a lot of... mistakes. The animations are way off- particularly on Woodle. When he turns, he does it so exact. Like a computer program being told turn precisely ninety degrees left. It just seems unnatural and bothers me. Woodle's feet also glide off the ground when he walks, and when he jumps... he can oftentimes nearly stick his feet all the way up in the air- doing a 180 and back before landing on a platform three feet higher than them. Woodle, as you may assume, is very agile- of course. There's also this weird enemy who walks on these long legs like he has Monkey Butt, and when you kill him, it almost looks like he was blasted back by a rocket onto his tuchas. Another graphical problem is Woodle's berry bag. The more berries you pick up, the bigger it gets. But the bigger it gets- the more it turns into a balloon encompassing the space around it, whether it be a wall nearby or Woodle himself.\n\nYou'd think there'd be more intelligent thought put into this game. Like maybe, the more berries you get the better. But it'll weigh you down, as your bag gets more full. Or the water may push you back towards the edge a little as you walk through it (instead of pathetically slowing you down). Or maybe there would be platforms that fall out as you stand on them longer. Or maybe if you die, you go back the start (as WTA has trouble remembering where to respawn you whenever you die. Sometimes I'd end up at the start, sometimes I'd end up five feet from where I died), and lose some of your berries. But that's far too challenging for a game like this! So the developers just tones and dumbed everything down into a monotonous mess that feels far longer than the 100 minutes I spent beating the story and getting the 850 berries (because there's no way in hell I'm going for that 3000 berry achievement). And yeah, the story is simple and sparse. Get tears, a tree with a beard is happy. The end.\n\nThis game is bad in terms of graphics, sound, design, and story. The only slightly redeeming element would be the graphics since for the duration of the game they do look nice. But everything else in this game is just so poorly done, it drags down the whole experience until you're done the game and you realise how many precious minutes you've wasted by staring at a screen, bored. The screen looks nice, though","August 27, 2015","false","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

Enemies are useless, shallow and beating them is trivial. The (fixed) camera management is godawful poorly designed, sometimes it gets stuck and you have to restart the game.

His jump can very from just-the-right-height to completely-off depending on whether Woodle feels like it or not (Sprinting usually helps. Sometimes.) And he also slides just a little, so if you're planning on landing on that very small platform... you'll be doing that jump at least five more times till Woodle can keep his bloody feet actually on it.\n\nThe lack of HUD can make the game feel even more vague. Collecting berries often seemed like a fruitless task without showing a little number up on the screen. So I'd have to keep turning off the game then back on, to go back to Woodle's house and see the actual number. "But why would you need berries?" you may ask, potenial buyer. "F*** if I know!" I'd reply, "I just get them because there's nothing else to do!" You need berries because if you get so many... you get a new leaf! Specifically, if you get up to 800 berries, you get a yellow, orange, and white leaf. And what do they do? Exactly the same thing! They blast a thingy that kills an enemy from the distance. The only thing that actually changes is the shape of the projectile and it's color. Personally, I think the change is asinine, as the green leaf can kill literally ANY enemy in one swipe. That's what I call real challenge right there! If you get 850 berries (which is a very odd number, in retrospect) you get a bandana. "Why would you want a bandana?" you may ask again. "F*** if I know!" I'd repeat, "But it looks cool when you jump!"\n\nAnd, again, if you think those graphics look so cute.... you'll be having seconds thoughts when you play the game- as it tends to make a lot of... mistakes. The animations are way off- particularly on Woodle. When he turns, he does it so exact. Like a computer program being told turn precisely ninety degrees left. It just seems unnatural and bothers me. Woodle's feet also glide off the ground when he walks, and when he jumps... he can oftentimes nearly stick his feet all the way up in the air- doing a 180 and back before landing on a platform three feet higher than them. Woodle, as you may assume, is very agile- of course. There's also this weird enemy who walks on these long legs like he has Monkey Butt, and when you kill him, it almost looks like he was blasted back by a rocket onto his tuchas. Another graphical problem is Woodle's berry bag. The more berries you pick up, the bigger it gets. But the bigger it gets- the more it turns into a balloon encompassing the space around it, whether it be a wall nearby or Woodle himself.\n\nYou'd think there'd be more intelligent thought put into this game. Like maybe, the more berries you get the better. But it'll weigh you down, as your bag gets more full. Or the water may push you back towards the edge a little as you walk through it (instead of pathetically slowing you down). Or maybe there would be platforms that fall out as you stand on them longer. Or maybe if you die, you go back the start (as WTA has trouble remembering where to respawn you whenever you die. Sometimes I'd end up at the start, sometimes I'd end up five feet from where I died), and lose some of your berries. But that's far too challenging for a game like this! So the developers just tones and dumbed everything down into a monotonous mess that feels far longer than the 100 minutes I spent beating the story and getting the 850 berries (because there's no way in hell I'm going for that 3000 berry achievement). And yeah, the story is simple and sparse. Get tears, a tree with a beard is happy. The end.\n\nThis game is bad in terms of graphics, sound, design, and story. The only slightly redeeming element would be the graphics since for the duration of the game they do look nice. But everything else in this game is just so poorly done, it drags down the whole experience until you're done the game and you realise how many precious minutes you've wasted by staring at a screen, bored. The screen looks nice, though","August 27, 2015","false","1.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

It is a game with lively and colorful graphics, reminiscent of many of the favorite games I played as a child on the N64, however that's about where the games charm ends.\n\nPros:\n-Beautifully designed and vibrantly colored worlds and characters which are cute, whimsical and well designed bring back fond nostalgic memories of old school platformers.  The areas seem fairly well designed and are really a treat to look at.  The character designs are really cute and unique.  These qualities present a lush and intriguing platforming environment that you actually want to try to explore.\n\n-Great controller support which implements itself without need for setup.  The preset button configurations are simple and intuitive.\n\nCons:\n-Horrible animation quality, the characters seem to half walk/half glide across the screen, animations are slow and choppy.\n\n-Poor camera control creates problems within the game where you can't see where you are trying to go, or enemies and platforms are blocked from view.  Often times it's difficult to grasp where you stand in relation to the platforms and enemies around you, leaving you swinging your weapon and finding the enemy is to your side rather than behind you, or much farther away than you thought.  This is a real killer as much of the game requires reaching that next platform and when you can't see it, the result is quite frustrating.\n\n-Poor performance causes this game to run extremely slowly and rifled with lag.  You'll feel more often than not that you are about as quick as a snail... and this alone makes you want to close the game.\n\n-enemy death animations are slow and drawn out, however as they are dying they still manage to attack and kill you while you attempt to slink away.\n\n-the sound quality is really mediocre, some sounds are drastically louder than others, most of the sound effects sound like they do not belong in the game and make no sence at all.  The music is ok, but it really doesn't feel like its in the right game.\n\nOverall I can't recommend anyone plays this game.  Adventure/platformer games are all about the gameplay, and this game has a horrble implementation of anything resembling gameplay.  Its so gruellingly slow and buggy you want to ragequit after just a few minutes.","September 17, 2014","false","3.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

At first I was just going to let it run for cards but I actually like it.\nIs it a children's game? I think so.\nIs it a hard game? The controls alone make it nintendo hard. Plus if you touch the wrong creature you're back to the start. If you're precise enough it's not really hard though.\nAlso you can have a peaceful run and not kill anything if you're into that. You won't get a game reward for it but isn't the moral gratification of not hurting fictional creatures the ultimare reward?\n\nThe story is kinda weird because there's obviously a lot of water around so there's probably a sinister reason why you have to collect tears. Those fairies probably poisoned the water to kill the trees and there will be an epic war at the end where you use the tears to summon a dark wizard that gives Woodle superpowers and everything turns way darker and you fight evil fairies. I mean you play as a stump so there's probably a sinister reason why that's all that's left from the protagonist. I'm still at the first level but idk that game looks suspiciously happy. And Woodle only has a dad. Bet the evil fairies killed his mother. Maybe the tears will resurrect her? So many questions. The plot is so deep and mysterious that I'll probably play it a bunch of times to unravel all the secrets. Will update the review if I find evil fairies.","March 29","true","0.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/juniordax/recommended/299460/","juniordax","Ezrifan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/juniordax/","146 products in account","I found this game fun and addictive. The graphics are bright and colourful making the worlds in this game great for kids. The main character is a log... yes that's right a log, you play as a sentient log on a mission from his sentient tree father too bring water back to the world. The story is very simple to follow and seems very reminiscent of old school 90's platformer games (Like Super Mario 64) in which the main character (and the player for that matter) is given a simple plot device (e.g. save the princess) and the story is set up and the rest is up to the levels and gameplay.\n\nThe levels are very intresting each with there own unique style, there are six worlds in total to explore as you collect berries, fairy tears in order to heal the world and you chase down the complete set of 8 steam achivements. You can even team up with a friend to complete levels with the local two player co-op mode.\n\nThe soundtrack is quite charming and only adds to the overall enjoyment of the game, at times I even felt transported back to being a child and playing classic Nintendo platform games (Super Mario, Banjo Kazooie and Donkey Kong 64, to name but a few, came to mind.)\n\nIt's far from perfect, as the issues with the camera will show. As you are playing this game sometimes the camera will go a bit crazy and move to a point which will make it very hard to see your character, this happened to me on several occasions and made the levels harder to complete (not impossible just a bit harder.) As you can see from my total play time, (at the point of writing this it was 1.9 hrs) I has been quite a short game and even though the camera had its issues, I have still completed this game 100% with all the steam achivements unlocked.\n\nIn summary this game has some good moments that will spark nostalgic feelings in older gamers and spark new moments for younger gamers. The game is short so don't expect an epic story arc with hundreds of levels, but do expect fun gameplay, cheery music with bright colors and vibrance throughout. It may have its issues but this fun little game could keep you busy even if it is for a short while.\n\nReview Score - 7/10\n\nWhy 7/10?\n1. Would like to see more levels.\n2. Camera Issues and Minor Bugs.\n3. Fun, addictive gameplay.\n4. Great Music.\n5. Colorful, bright graphics.\n6. Main character is very unique.","November 21, 2015","true","1.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The art design is beautiful and the level design flashes potential.  It has a cute and simple concept that had the potential for a very fun, Nintendo 64 styled platformer that you don't see much of nowadays.  If I was an indie publisher, and someone presented this to me as an Alpha, I might have been tempted to fund further development, however that's all this game really is.  It plays like an unfinished Alpha of a game that has a lot of potential.  The level design is pretty, but the game is barely playable.  The game would be more tolerable if there was a working camera.  The camera gives automatic angles, and is absolutely horrid at it.  It makes the game way more difficult then it is supposed to be.  The only control the player has on the camera is to zoom in and out, and sometimes that doesn't even work.  This game plays like an abandoned early access game.  Avoid.","June 27, 2015","false","1.5"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

You're only making the game easier for yourself, not more difficult when you progress.\n- The achievements are uncreative: collect 3000 berries.

In fact, I found none of the "classical elements from the 90's games" and "new interesting ideas." described on the store page. What I did find while playing this was a poorly made platformer with horrible camera controls and nonexistent enemies (unless you count the ones which just stand there and wiggle their arms at you, which is actually pretty much all of them). The developer attempts to cover up the fact that this game is lacking some of the most essential points of a platformer by trying to sell you on the "catchy and unique" art style and "refreshingly peaceful" feeling of travelling the game world. Perhaps the graphics style might appeal to some (namely children) but the only reason the graphics are unique is because most other game developers choose to use things like textures as well as models more complicated than your basic cubes and cylinders with legs. It was a bold move (or more likely one made out of the inability to produce anything higher in quality) but for me it just didn't pay off.","August 9, 2014","false","1.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Virsai/recommended/299460/","Virsai","Fate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Virsai/","113 products in account","I can describe this game in three simple words: Pure. Platforming. Fun. Wait, why would I not recommend this game if I enjoy this game, mixed messages galore! Well, if you are sticking around to read this, I wouldn't recommend this game to an average steam user. Why? If you look at the most popular games sold, they are creations of commitment to spending hours and hours exploring, killing things, playing online with friends to continue the rampage. This game has absolutely none of that, the only people I would ever recommend this game to are those that don't play many games, those who don't really have time to play a game, anyone that that wants a very small game to enjoy or maybe a little sibling or relative who is just staring off playing games.\n\nYou are Woodle, you must collect berries and fairy drops...not much story beyond that. You travel through eight worlds to collect these things, in each world are three drops that you must collect. There are a few weapon unlockables, but other than that, this game finds its charm in jumping, exploring, and enjoying the very vibrant world created by Chubby Pixel. As I was playing this, I was reminded of games like Banjo-Kazooie or even Gex 64: Enter the Gecko, it was such a great trip into nostalgia, that I didn't mind that it took me a little over an hour to beat, but in my opinion, it was extremely worth it.\n\nNow on to the bad stuff: the camera is jittery and sometimes in the wrong place, there isn't any sort of GUI and the enemies aren't really...smart. Again, this is why I would not really recommend this game to an average gamer who would rather play something like Skyrim or Dark Souls II. Another thing I want to point out is that this game is much easier played using the 360 controller instead of mouse and keyboard as controlling the character is sometimes difficult.\n\nHowever, if you are like me and just enjoy small or even have time to commit to some 60+ hour adventure, I highly recommend you at least watch some gameplay footage of it. To the average gamer, though, who has that sort of patience and willingness to venture out to become a Dragonborn, crunching numbers, calculating statistics or wanting to see that KDR ratio on your leaderboard, this game is definitely not for you.","July 31, 2014","false","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Virsai/recommended/299460/","Virsai","Fate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Virsai/","113 products in account","I can describe this game in three simple words: Pure. Platforming. Fun. Wait, why would I not recommend this game if I enjoy this game, mixed messages galore! Well, if you are sticking around to read this, I wouldn't recommend this game to an average steam user. Why? If you look at the most popular games sold, they are creations of commitment to spending hours and hours exploring, killing things, playing online with friends to continue the rampage. This game has absolutely none of that, the only people I would ever recommend this game to are those that don't play many games, those who don't really have time to play a game, anyone that that wants a very small game to enjoy or maybe a little sibling or relative who is just staring off playing games.\n\nYou are Woodle, you must collect berries and fairy drops...not much story beyond that. You travel through eight worlds to collect these things, in each world are three drops that you must collect. There are a few weapon unlockables, but other than that, this game finds its charm in jumping, exploring, and enjoying the very vibrant world created by Chubby Pixel. As I was playing this, I was reminded of games like Banjo-Kazooie or even Gex 64: Enter the Gecko, it was such a great trip into nostalgia, that I didn't mind that it took me a little over an hour to beat, but in my opinion, it was extremely worth it.\n\nNow on to the bad stuff: the camera is jittery and sometimes in the wrong place, there isn't any sort of GUI and the enemies aren't really...smart. Again, this is why I would not really recommend this game to an average gamer who would rather play something like Skyrim or Dark Souls II. Another thing I want to point out is that this game is much easier played using the 360 controller instead of mouse and keyboard as controlling the character is sometimes difficult.\n\nHowever, if you are like me and just enjoy small or even have time to commit to some 60+ hour adventure, I highly recommend you at least watch some gameplay footage of it. To the average gamer, though, who has that sort of patience and willingness to venture out to become a Dragonborn, crunching numbers, calculating statistics or wanting to see that KDR ratio on your leaderboard, this game is definitely not for you.","July 31, 2014","false","2.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

You jump around and collect three "fairy tears" per level and then reach the exit. You can collect berries on the way to unlock better versions of the leaf you use to attack, and avoid or kill enemies that mostly don't seem to care about much more than just standing there. The controls feel a little loose and impercise, so some jumps are a bit harder than they look like they should be.\n\nThe whole game just kinda seems unfinished. Except for a few that go on patrols or the rare one that will actually walk towards you, most enemies are just sort of out of the way and not doing anything. There are no camera controls; everything shown with pre-determined camera angles, and some of them are in bad positions. Some of them also won't trigger properly, leaving you with even worse views sometimes. The checkpoints seem broken too; SOMETIMES you'll respawn at a checkpoint close to where you died, but most of the time it sends you back to the very start of the level. Once, the game sent me back to the start of the stage with the camera facing the wrong way. Since you can't fix that, I had to play the first part of the level basically backwards until I hit a point where the camera decided to change to something more reasonable.\n\nThe level select are just globes that show up in your house without any sort of labels and aren't presented in a linear order, so it could be easy to forget what level is the latest one you unlocked if you step away from the game and come back. On the other hand, since the game only lasts about 40 minutes, you'll probably beat it in one sitting anyway. I kinda considered going back to collect the rest of the berries to get the last weapon, but the game doesn't tell you how many berries you've collected in each level, so god knows where those are [edit: It turns out that doesn't matter, because you can go back to a level and just get as many berries as you want to get the next item. It's not counting your completion rate, so you don't HAVE to get everything].\n\nThis game could get better! It seems like the devs are patching it with new levels and features, like multiplayer and the ability to zoom the camera in and out (but really, full camera control is more important). I feel like they do care about the game, but it's just not all there yet. I will keep an eye on it as they continue to add to the game, and I hope those problems I addressed get fixed.

I guess I could start with the best part, colourful graphics. Other than that... The game is pretty bad in my opinion. The soundtracks are just so simple and have a maximum of 1 to 3 instruments per song. The sound effects aren't good. The game has many glitches, such as: Monsters killing you after you killed them, respawning at the start of the level even after respawning at a certain checkpoint (no way to know when you activate a checkpoint)...\n\nThere's also the horrible, horrible camera angles that the game decides to give you. I had to control the game with my Gamepad + my keyboard + my mouse. Jumping in this game was very stressing, I could never tell how far I needed to jump because of the camera angles. The game has no main-menu and no UI at all. To quit a level, you either have to reach the end of it after collecting 3 tears or close the game, because there are no buttons to quit a level (as far as I can tell).\n\nThis game only took me 57 minutes to complete and the story was inexistant at all. That's including the glitches I ran into and the few times I pressed ESC to pause my game... Which actually closes the game.

Cute main character and world. Camera is the worst in history, as you can't move it and it gets stuck at terrible angles and gets you killed. One time I restarted at a checkpoint and it was facing a different way than it was supposed to so I couldn't progress in the level because I couldn't see and had to restart the level. No way to rebind keys. No main menu or way to exit besides completely exiting game or alt f4'ing. Platforming doesn't feel as responsive as it could and just feels a bit off. Game takes about 45 min to complete, which is way too short. Also checkpoints make no sense as a lot of times if you miss a jump you have to start back at beginning of level but sometimes you start closer up but for no apparent reason. One time I respawned closer, died at the exact same part, and then respawned at the start of the level, which made no sense because I had just died in this same spot and spawned much closer. 6.5/10.

It looks cute and stuff, but playability is nowhere to be found.\n\nThe goal of the game is not clear, at the begining your father/fake Deku tree explains that you must pick up fairy tears, but nothig seems to happen when you do so, and there is no tear counter or something. On addition, there is no way to quit a level; you either close the game or stay in the level forever (or if there is a way, I have not been capable to figure it out). If that was not enough, the point of view spins randomly, making the game almost imposible to play at some points.\n\nHowever, if you can get it for free or as part of a good bundle, it has only six cards so you can score an easy badge.\n\n________\n\nTal vez el peor juego que he probado este año. Es bonito y tal, pero la jugabilidad brilla por su ausencia.\n\nEl objetivo no está claro, al principio tu padre/falso árbol Deku explica que hay que conseguir lágrimas de hada, pero parece que no pasa nada cuando lo haces y no hay contador de lágrimas ni nada parecido. Además, no hay manera de salir del nivel que estés jugando; o te quedas en él para siempre o cierras el juego (o si la hay, yo no he sido capaz de descubrirla). Por si era poco, la cámara gira aleatoriamente, haciendo algunas partes prácticamente imposibles de jugar.\n\nDe todos modos, si lo consigues gratis o en un bundle interesante, sólo tiene seis cromos así que es una insignia bastante fácil de conseguir.","July 6, 2014","false","0.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The logical choice would clearly be to not play and find better friends, but if you held out till the end like I did for this game, you'd see that the revolver was full of blanks. I honestly thought there would be some sort of twist in the story, a "Bang" so to speak. something to break the boring atmosphere and something to give the clunky controls worth, but there was no solace. In fact, the story makes no sense as you are tying to "bring water to a thirsty land" yet every mission has waterfalls and rivers. The enemies are slow and easy to kill, but the only way you'll end up dying in this game is with the platforming. It's easy platforming, but the character will just rocket to any direction you set him towards. For instance, in most games, turning around while jumping might slow you down just enough to allow you to land. turning around here would be like using the portal gun to rocket you backwards through the power of momentum.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenhiragii/recommended/299460/","kenhiragii","Even In Your Multiplayer!","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenhiragii/","472 products in account","I've played two of the however many levels of the game, and I have to say - I don't get what all the hate is about. It's a cute little platformer that doesn't try to reinvent the genre. The story is that you were brought to life specifically to collect Fairy Tears and bring water to a land - the Fairy Tears acting as your MacGuffin, like the crystals in a Crash game. You collect them throughout simple platforming levels that are surprisingly long, but never overstay their welcome. Along the way, you pick up Wumpa fr-, err, berries, which serve as sort of a score/unlockable counter - every so often, you unlock a new item for your little Deku Scrub. There also seem to be a level that requires 600 berries, but I'm not sure how grindy getting that is. The game overall is rather easy, however; enemies serve little to no threat, and the platforming is simple. The thing that's most likely to kill you is the camera screwing up because you backtracked.

It's a cute little platformer that doesn't try to reinvent the genre. The story is that you were brought to life specifically to collect Fairy Tears and bring water to a land - the Fairy Tears acting as your MacGuffin, like the crystals in a Crash game. You collect them throughout simple platforming levels that are surprisingly long, but never overstay their welcome. Along the way, you pick up Wumpa fr-, err, berries, which serve as sort of a score/unlockable counter - every so often, you unlock a new item for your little Deku Scrub. There also seem to be a level that requires 600 berries, but I'm not sure how grindy getting that is. The game overall is rather easy, however; enemies serve little to no threat, and the platforming is simple. The thing that's most likely to kill you is the camera screwing up because you backtracked. To fix a camera screw up, you just go past the point you were just at - but it's still irritating. So far, I give it a 6.5/10, another .5 if it gets a controllable camera.

Cute main character and world. Camera is the worst in history, as you can't move it and it gets stuck at terrible angles and gets you killed. One time I restarted at a checkpoint and it was facing a different way than it was supposed to so I couldn't progress in the level because I couldn't see and had to restart the level. No way to rebind keys. No main menu or way to exit besides completely exiting game or alt f4'ing. Platforming doesn't feel as responsive as it could and just feels a bit off. Game takes about 45 min to complete, which is way too short. Also checkpoints make no sense as a lot of times if you miss a jump you have to start back at beginning of level but sometimes you start closer up but for no apparent reason. One time I respawned closer, died at the exact same part, and then respawned at the start of the level, which made no sense because I had just died in this same spot and spawned much closer. 6.5/10.

If that was not enough, the point of view spins randomly, making the game almost imposible to play at some points.\n\nHowever, if you can get it for free or as part of a good bundle, it has only six cards so you can score an easy badge.\n\n________\n\nTal vez el peor juego que he probado este año. Es bonito y tal, pero la jugabilidad brilla por su ausencia.\n\nEl objetivo no está claro, al principio tu padre/falso árbol Deku explica que hay que conseguir lágrimas de hada, pero parece que no pasa nada cuando lo haces y no hay contador de lágrimas ni nada parecido. Además, no hay manera de salir del nivel que estés jugando; o te quedas en él para siempre o cierras el juego (o si la hay, yo no he sido capaz de descubrirla). Por si era poco, la cámara gira aleatoriamente, haciendo algunas partes prácticamente imposibles de jugar.\n\nDe todos modos, si lo consigues gratis o en un bundle interesante, sólo tiene seis cromos así que es una insignia bastante fácil de conseguir.","July 6, 2014","false","0.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Keys are bindable though. You can do a 2 player deal as well if you have a small child that would like this kind of game. Don't make an adult sit down with you though. That'd be cruel.\n\nits a decent platformer as in its not bad. its just not original. nothing about the game is original. its hardly even an adventure, with just a few stages and no connection between things. barest of bones narrative. and to be frank, very lame art/world/character design. only controls are to move, jump, run, adjust the camera's closeness to you (its not a camera you can rotate) and weakly swing a leaf (your one and only move that isn't simply moving your character around the level) there really isn't a difficulty to speak of. a 5 year old could play this game to completion.\n\nmy only real gripe is the inconsistant and uncooperative camera. also the overall art design really seems like it was made by one teenager with ambitions to go into game development, which in combination with the lack of other game elements warrents very little of your time. however i do immensely recommend it if you are after easy achievements. I have them all with the playtime shown in my review.\nAt 2.99, I wouldn't recommend this game.

Basically, there were things I liked about it and things I didn't, but I THINK there is just enough for me to say the good outweighs the bad. Nevertheless, I always feel the need to explain everything in detail. After all, this game's getting a sequel soon, and it's best there's improvements to be made for it.\n\nOne thing that stuck out for me was the visual style. I kinda have a soft spot for it. It has a homemade feel to it, with a hint of Nintendo 64. The levels also drive home a sense that feels much like Super Mario 3D Land. As this adorable little tree log, you simply have to get to the end of each level, while collecting three floating water drops along the way for each. It's simple, but cozy. For the most part, anyway. I do wish the soundtrack was more upbeat and catchy, but the platforming is fairly enjoyable, and your attack has decent range, making for enemy kills to be reasonably tangible.\n\nNot as reasonable is when Woodle Tree gets hit. For some reaosn, the checkpoint system seems to only work when Woodle Tree falls off a ledge; when you get hit by an enemy, you instantly have to start AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LEVEL. Granted, you have infinite lives and still have track of the water drops collected, but why can't I always start off at a portion of the level regardless of how I died? The control is also not the most intuitive it could have been. For some reason, you can't run and jump when moving up or down, nor can you do diagonal jumps. The control issues definitely need fixing up. To a lesser extent, there's the camera. I'm not as bothered by its clunkiness as everyone else was, but it can still be glaring for a game like this.\n\nLastly, the game is over quickly and abruptly. I beat it in almost an hour's worth of game time, and while I'm the kind of guy that doesn't mind a short game (especially when the price is as low as it is), I was expecting at least an hour or two more than there was. And it wasn't like there was a boss battle or anything to close the game with; it just...threw an ending screen and that was it.\n\nSo yeah, this is definitely a flawed game. I wouldn't even really call it a great game, but I still at least recommend it if you can spare a few bucks for a small dose of indie 3D platforming.............Just as long as you can deal with the control and checkpoint issues.","May 21","true","2.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A log simulator?" Well, not quite! You play as a cute log who is on an adventure to collect water and fruit. Throughout your travels, you will come across mobs that you will have to stick it to.\n\nHonestly, the greatest enemy in the game, apart from falling out of a reality that even Bear Grylls would struggle to clamber back into, is the camera. The positioning is horrendous at times - it will get stuck a lot. Furthermore it points at random things, which definitely makes jumping almost impossible.\n\nDespite all of its flaws, I somehow ended up enjoying Woodle Tree Adventures and got hooked into playing it for a few hours. Sure, the game may be basic but it has a fresh pine smell to it.\n\nThe camera angle and positioning is definitely a negative - you will randomly be glitched behind blocks, what is quite frustrating at times.\n\nOverall, I would give this game a 4/5.\n\nA message to the developers: I cannot wait for Woodle Tree Adventures tree-quel!\n\n\nThanks for reading my review, and have a tree-mendous day.\n\n\n\n","May 27","true","5.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","1"

This review will cover everything that you need to know about this amazing platformer puzzle action adventure rpg extraviganza of a game.\n\nGameplay\nthe gameplay is spectacular having a very well passed game, woodle runs like sonic yet jumps like rosalina's up-b in smash, this may seem like an odd combo but it works perfectly and I love it. The game controls fluently to the point where I thought I was the character in the game (its just that good) and the combat is just as great, with fast-paced action packed battles where you must use your leaf of the heavens to shatter your opponents while avoiding their attacks, all while watcing out for citizens, this is a mechanic I love as, the more citizens you hit the more woodle becomes devistated it truly makes you feel for the little tree\n\nsoundtrack\nthe soundtrack, which was created by David Wise and Nobuo Uematsu is a delight to the ears, the songs mostly consist of amazing piano works with some sax on the side. The music is heart warming, it can be light and then switch to a heazy blast in a matter of seconds, its truly spectacular. Plus the amazing guest artists such as earth wind and fire, ween and drake really brought some amazing pieces to the already amazing soundtrack.\n\ndifficulty\nthe game is very challenging however it is always making sure that it was your fault that you died never the games. Lag? theres none of that. Bad controls? nope. The game can be compared to the likes of darksouls however much harder. You are always rewarded for figureing those tuff parts of levels out and it makes you feel awesome. For example when you fight the first boss in the game, the minotaur, seems impossible until you realize you must climb the ladder of faith to reach his horns then perform a takedown. The games challenge is great.\n\nCamera\nfor some odd reason this is complained about by many, and honestly I dont know why. The camera shows dinamic angles that make you feel good about yourself while not screwing with gameplay. Ill keep this paragraph short by saying the camera is great and y do ppl complain m8 XDDDDDDD!!!!!!111!!!11111!!!1\n\nthe other stuff\nits all good, bro\n\nfinal verdict\nwoodle tree adventure is spectacular and shows a great side to gaming. Where games like street fighter V and CS GO failed to perform this game excelled. Woodle tree adventure is something you should all pick up, try to get it at full price so the devlopers can get supported to make a second entry in the franchise. Woodle tree adventure proves that their is a light side to video games, that they are the future. Woodle tree adventure is more then a game\n\nIts a legend\n\n10/10","March 5","true","0.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","1"

The game simply doesn't feel finished.  It feels like an alpha version running round empty worlds collecting berries and engaging in kill or be killed tactics with the most oblivious creatures.  The style is cute, the glitchy physics are fun, the story is only technically there.  "We need water! No, ignore that water level, we need giant drops of fairy tears!  Okay, done.  You must ingest additional berries."  This game is technically fun, but not much.  It's honestly not much of anything.  I tried this game because it was a cute looking platformer.  Unfortunately the camera angles were too debilitating, and the enemies too confusing, to allow the platforming to be any kind of interesting.  It could become something interesting, but its been around for a while and doesn't look like it's going anywhere.","July 15, 2014","false","1.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

The biggest for me is the camera, which you have almost no control over except for zooming in and out, which seldom helps with some parts, like the "side-scrolling" parts.  The enemies in the game are also very dumb.  Some do not even move while the more aggressive only come after you if you're three feet away, so they're not much of a threat (unless, of course, you spawn right next to them with this game's shotty checkpoint system and die).  Oh, and the enemies can all be one shotted as well.

This game is bad\n\nI got it for free, so I guess I shouldn't complain but, I will.\nThis game is very much like an old PS1 game, but the controls, in my opinon, are awful. The platforming is so unfair, making you make the impossible jumps just so you can collect that on last berry that you need to 100% the level. That's not even the worse part. The worst part is that when you even try to 100% a level, you still have to redo it, over and over to get the berries for those two f'ing achievements. This game is just something you should buy for a friend you hate, but don't want to let them down.\n\nSo, would I recommend this game? No. Unless you want to blow some cash on a game that feels like it could be a flash game.\n\nI give this game a 4.7/10.

At first I saw some potential in it because the art style seemed interessting.But then I actually started playing the game. The first major issue is that you do not control your own camera angle. Often times I was stuck somewhere just because the camera chose the most inappropriate angle for the situation.\nSecondly, the controls are extremely clunky almost to the point where the game is completely unplayable. What's more the game displays the depth pretty inaccurately. At some points I couldn't make a jump because I thought i was at the same level as the platform (although this may be caused by the poor camera angles).\nThe game just feels unfinished. I am really sad to say this, as I saw some potential in it. The only redeeming factor for this game is that you can make a profit from the trading cards(because it is 5 cents as of writing this review).

Really, who'dve guessed, but it's not really why you'd think.\nYou look at the game and it looks like some animation studen't fist product\nIt's got cutsey, simple graphics, it's a grab the key to open the door type platformer but that's not why it's not good.\nIt's not good because it doesn't feel rewarding\nI see no reason to grab these enormous berries(?) other than to fill my sack.\nThe level design was alright but the enemies felt apathetic, like they wanted to attack but couldn't\nAlso the lack of UI for the berries(?) to show your progress on a level by level basis should have been added.\n\nSo yeah, no. Money could be better spent elsewhere.\n","February 26","false","7.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
