Very unforgiving and challenging, but you get a real feeling of accomplishment when you pass the puzzles.  There is a HUGE variety of worlds/levels with varying music/art/gameplay.  Just bear with it and you can develop the skills to make it through this game.","February 25","true","4.8"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","14","16","0","0"

This is easily the hardest game I've ever played.\n\nSTORYYou play as three bros who go back in time to save a member of their band who got sucked into a time vortex. There are 9 levels, each with a different setting, including the Stone Age, Ancient Egypt, Feudal Japan, Ancient Greece, the Far West and the Future. I liked the variety of settings, but the actual story (which parodies the simplistic nature of time-travel movies and games) isn't a selling point, nor does it want to be.\n\nGRAPHICSPowered by Unity, the pixelated and almost hand-drawn levels are full of details in the background, including a different Game Over screen based on which level you are playing. However, it will start looking a tad repetitive, especially in the Far West and Piracy levels.\n\nGAMEPLAYIn each level you guide the bros to the end while avoiding traps and fighting enemies. One bro can use a sword and walk while crouched, another can jump and shoot rockets, and the last one can punch and use a shield. This is pretty similar to the SNES classic The Lost Bros, but instead of switching between characters, you control them at the same time. The controls aren't intuitive, and playing with a controller is a must, since using the keyboard is extremely awkward.\n\nCHALLENGEForget GHost'n'Goblins, Dark Souls, Super Meat Boy and I Wanna Be The Guy. Lost Bros is the hardest and most frustrating game I've ever played. In over two hours I beated the tutorial, died over 250 times and managed to fail every single attempt at finishing a level. The difference between the aformentioned games and this one is that this game is not enjoyable. The levels feature a lack of a learning curve and an astonishing amount of obstacles (as well as friendly fire) that will make you more and more depressed, until you start asking yourself why you are still playing, if you just keep dying in miserable ways.\n\nSOUNDWhile a couple of sound effects get a bit annoying, the soundtrack fits every time period perfectly. But prepare yourself to listen to the same 20 seconds of music every time you respawn.\n\nREPLAYABILITYFor you masochists out there, there are multiple levels of difficulties that make the experience even more unbearable. There are also 26 achievements to unlock, so prepare yourself for many hours of swearing and violently smashing your controller to the walls.\n\nOverall, Lost Bros is a competently made game that, unfortunately, lacks any kind of reward and enjoyment. I can't, for the love of God, recommend this game to anyone except fans of hardcore frustrating games.\n\nStory: 6\nGraphics: 7.5\nGameplay: 8\nChallenge: 9\nSound: 8\nReplayability: 8\n\nENJOYMENT: 2\nFRUSTRATION: 10\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website","February 25","false","5.0"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","61","20","33","7","3"

Don't be afraid to switch it up if you're having a hard time in a particular area.\n\nDefinitely worth it for the price.","February 25","true","4.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

I know what you’re thinking so I advise you to get your mind out of the gutter. That’s not the type of threesome I am talking about. Have you ever wanted to know what it’s like to control three characters simultaneously? That’s the threesome I am talking about. That’s the concept of Lost Bros, the Steam debut of developer Wheat Muffin Games. It’s an interesting concept that is full of deranged little challenges and awkward gameplay even for those of you who are highly coordinated in the utilization of a video game controller. You’ll definitely want one of those as no matter how playable the game actually is with a keyboard the game was designed to be best played with a controller.\n\nGreat concept with pretty thorough execution. Good pixel graphics and cool enough soundtrack. I love the fact that they’ve integrated their game into Steamworks all the way through including leaderboards for speed run times, trading cards and achievements. Good value at $4.99. The downside is that if you’re not up for a challenge with the occasional rage inducing quit then you’re going to want to avoid this bad boy as it’s not for you and sadly that’s where the game got its only negative review thus far on Steam.\n\nEven if you find that you’re not very good at Lost Bros I believe that you will find the concept interesting enough to give it a playthrough. Whether that means you wait for it to be bundled is up to you but at just $4.99 the value is there.\n\nFor similar reviews and our popular giveaways please visit http://www.steamified.com/\nFeel free to join our Steam group and Curation http://steamcommunity.com/groups/Steamified","March 1","true","25.1"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","11","16","0","2"

Whether or not you try and/or fail! For the $5 price, I say its a fun buy. But just don't destroy your monitor in the process! :D","February 27","true","1.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

It's incredible to me that he made this all by himself, art, music, design, programming. Tons of time and effort put into this project, not as another mobile ripoff to make money, but as something actually creative, innovative, new, and fun. Knowing all that made it worth my time to stick with it long enough to develop the skills needed to enjoy playing.\n\nSo I've managed to get 4 out of the 9 orbs so far, and I'm finally starting to believe I can beat this game eventually.\n\nAs others have said, the game is very challenging, but it's mostly about learning new skills. We've all played a million platformers. When we start a new one we don't have to learn how to play. This game is different.\n\nWatch someone play a normal platformer who has never played one before. They will almost certainly get frustrated at first. That's how this game is, but for everyone.\n\nNow, stick with the game for a couple hours and you'll start to learn new ways to hold the controller, new ways to approach puzzles and enemies, etc.\n\nBest of all, once you manage to get past that awful unfair impossible puzzle...you'll find you could do it again pretty easily. Which means it's fair after all, just not the way your brain was thinking before :D\n\nSide note: somebody should use this game in a study of how bad humans are at multitasking :P\n\nTL;DR; Game is awesome and challenging but you have to be willing to learn new skills instead of just playing the same way you've been playing every platformer you've played the last 20+ years.","March 11","true","10.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

You can play local co-op but everyone will have access to every character","February 29","true","5.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","2"
