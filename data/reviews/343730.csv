So I quit the game and didn't think any more about it. Then I saw on reddit someone said this game is going to be awesome, and someone agreed after they realized you can break the walls of your cave. I was like whaaa????\n\nSo i go home and fire it back up. First thing I do is hit the cave wall, just once.\n\nErr. Mah. Gerd.\n\nMind completely blown. I cannot WAIT until the full game is released now. Freakin EPIC!","April 27","true","0.3"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","88","15","17","10","0"

It's also a game I wish I could experience for the first time again whenever I load it up.   It's a short, but breathtaking experience that truly transports players into a very unique visualization of space.  There is a huge sense of discovery, and so far everyone I've had play it, has experienced it through very different perspectives.  The game is incredibly immersive from the moment it starts, and keeps you curious of whats beyond the prologue's boundaries.

But it still made my jaw drop. It isn't much of a game, rather an experience and you are part of it. The music, the sounds and the graphics style is what made it for me. Everything felt so crisp and amazing. It's hard to describe but it was magic.\n\nSadly it's very short but I guess that's why it is free and a prologue. The only criticism I have is the weird transition effect when you change levels. It hurt my eyes and I needed to close them to not lose my sanity.\n\nThanks for making this!

You absolutely have to try it, even if you have a fear of heights.  It's even that more amazing that you're playing a game on a computer that invokes your real fears and emotions in that way.

This wouldn't have been a problem except that the piece of rock directly above my head, although in a different universe, nonetheless shared it's physical coordinates with a halogen light bulb in real life.\nAs soon as I'd punched out the rock, I smelt burning.  Uh-oh, I thought, better check on the real world.\nI then realised that in this universe I had punched the light bulb, which had replied by exploding into a zillion tiny fragments.  A bit like my space cave, but different in that:\na. The pieces were much much smaller and sharper.\nb. There were a very great number of them.\nc. I was to spend the next hour on my hands and knees slowly picking them all out of the carpet.\n\nThe burning smell was smouldering carpet. Oops.\nHowever, the Vive controller was NOT DAMAGED, so a happy ending.\n\nSo now I know to switch off the light and remove the bulb before hitting invisible space rocks.\nDevs:  In future, please avoid placing things that are fun to hit in the same place as things that aren't fun to hit IRL.

You hit walls and break rocks and see a non interactive space scene (yes you get to break more rocks).  The initial cave's walls are also too close to the play area walls (I currently have a 3m x 2.5m play area) so that at a minimum chaperone pops up when you break the cave and you might hit your real walls (I did).  It's free but there are more fun things to do in VR, spend your time more wisely.","May 4","false","0.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Usually when i bring people over i have my monitor in a visibile spot so people can see what the person is doing in VR. But from this point on especially for this experience. Im going to start turning the monitor away, so people can't see whats going on inside.
