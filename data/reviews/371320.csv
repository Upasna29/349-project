It's obviously a labor of love made by people who like RPGs and worked hard to make a game they want others to enjoy. The game has a surprising number of extras, including minigames and comics.\n\nPlayers can choose whether to be a hero or a villain (although becoming a villain right away is a bit difficult because there's a tough fight). Most NPCs can be left alone, offended/apologized, or killed. Some can be recruited, then later killed if the player wants. The player can go on dates and have conversations with a variety of female NPCs, too.\n\nCustom controls are shown as needed, but otherwise players are expected to be familar with rpgmaker games. For example, players can run holding Shift or toggle full screen with Alt+Enter, but there's no help that mentions this. Also don't expect amenities like a journal or quest log, not that it's really needed.\n\nThe English translation is a bit rough but understandable. It adds to the charm.\n\nI'm not sure how much exposure this game will receive. I don't think it has much marketing and kind of showed up out of nowhere, but it's worth a look!","December 7, 2015","true","3.1"," 29 of 30 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","29","30","0","2"

It has an in-depth plot, dating/romances, leveling system, an inventory for items, and choices you make matter - affecting the story in different ways, so the replay value is virtually endless.\n\nSamsa And The Knights Of Light is my first RPG Maker experience, I must admit, even though I had done a bit of research I wasn't too sure about the quality of the writing or the game itself.\n\nI really enjoyed the game, I finished it once in around 100 minutes. It doesn't seem that long but think of this as somewhat of a Sega Genesis version of Fable.\n\nIn the short time that I played this game, I slaughtered a town, was hunted by old friends that I used to work with, befriended people, went on dates and then became a demon god who took over the world. That was the end of the game (hence the achievement called "The Evil God")... It was a short but epic time, too short, fortunately, the super cool thing is that when the game ended, it asked me if I wanted to start over (keeping my goods, cash and level), this makes me excited to play the game again as I realized  that I haven't began to scratch the surface of what it has to offer yet...\n\n+The writing of the game was superb, the story and how the characters interact felt very natural and exactly what this game needed. Good sense of humor, sarcasm, adultish.\n\n+The sound effects were nothing amazing but the music was phenomenal! Each chracter has their own theme playing in the background when you are holding a conversation with them.\n\n+The battle system is easy to pick up, I felt like it could have been a bit harder. All you have to do is buy a bunch of health potions and antidotes to cheat the battle you just died in. I think they could limit the number of items you carry to make the game more difficult.\n\n+Tons of activities for you to engage in... reading manga, playing arcade games, cooking, ect.\n\n+There is a small crafting system. It really only has to do with food items. I didn't do any of that in my first playthrough though.\n\n+A surprisingly likable cast of characters. I wasn't sure if playing as a blue demon was gonna cut it for me but the attitude and personality they gave the main character (Samsa) is very fun to play as. He is a bit of a jerk, if I could compare him to someone it would be Tony Stark/Iron Man of The Avengers.\n\n-I don't know if it's because of the resolution I'm running at but fullscreen mode was 4:8 ratio with some frame rate issue - a bit of lag. So I play it in windowed mode and it runs perfect that way. I'll figure it out though :)\n\nIt's an rpg maker game which - naturally scares people off but this title has so many different experiences to offer each time you play which is incredible.\n\nI highly recommend this game for the freedom it offers. For being a "retro-style game, it brings some newer mechanics while not compromising what old fans love about the SNES days. You can finish the game in a bit over an hour like I did but if you want to explore everything, you will be playing for hours.\n\nOverall, it's a great representation of how good a rpg maker game can be, it's addictive, made me feel like I was living an anime show. I'm glad my first experience of an rpg maker project was this one.","March 3","true","1.7"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","3"

Good storyline and it's twisted.. (compliment to story writer)\n2. Become real Demon or Angel Disguise in Demon shape, your choice.\n3. Date chicks and marry her.. ^O^\n4. mini games and comic, WTF!! you'll gonna love it..\n\nCons\n1. thought the storyline are good, yet the activities of Samsa did during the day are very limited, only grind at some town and try acquire new character or ask some chicks for a date. and it's very boring.. :(\n2. very short storyline, I have replay the game three times in one day.\n3. There are total 22 character that you can acquire in this game, yet there are no hint or clue of how to get all the character. so I have to go to every house and town on searching the 2 rest character in this game each day, still I havent got it, thought I Have played this game until the 105th day. unlike Suikoden II, in Suikoden II there are character that can helped to give you hint or clue to get all the character in that game.\n\n\nfor nearly 5 buck, I still recommended this game and hope there are some development to the game.","December 12, 2015","true","13.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

The story is terrible and feels like a minimum effort tale. My only recommendation is if you like easy dumb new grounds style flash game RPG's and are under the age of 17, this won't be a bad mindless buy. If you are an adult, or you want decent gameplay, a decent story or even some decent jokes, look somewhere else. This game should be a free flash game on new grounds for how simple every aspect of it is. Simple isn't always bad, especially if you're a kid with some time to kill.","April 27","false","2.8"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"
