Minimalistic by appearance and game design which isn't a bad thing at all.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1s0cC_bODI\nInitially given 3 class options all having different skills and base stats, Knight, Barbarian and Paladin. Clear enough levels and be rewarded with alternate options such as the sentinel. Progress involves clearing each room which has procedurally generated item and enemy placements. While mouse was playable I would suggest a gamepad as class skills were set to each button and block on the triggers. Felt much more responsive and can be quite challenging playing solo.\n\nNo loot drops in levels, just gold coins and health potions. On each floor was a treasure room which contained gold coins and a large chest with your choice of 1 of 3 items. Gold coins collected can be spent between levels at the blacksmith on upgrading items you have obtained. Can also take this opportunity to raise stat points that were received from characters leveling up. No complex skill trees involved but enough to be interesting. On character death you have the option of restarting on same floor or returning to the start of the dungeon, between sessions all items obtained and stat points invested were retained.\n\nGreat soundtrack but could use a little more variation and I thought the levels were maybe a little repetitive too early. Perhaps mix in the fresh tile colours earlier and would suggest possibly adding some secret rooms that require bashing on cracked walls, just for something extra to find. Only supports local multiplayer (4players) so I didn't have a chance to test multiplayer unfortunately. Would make a fun couch co-op game without a doubt.\n\nFirst impressions = Decent and worth checking out if you're a fan of roguelikes or even just older sidescrollers. As mentioned it's a little difficult solo and probably more directed toward mp, but far from being impossible and rather rewarding. Not just about button mashing either, plenty of timing involved. Cheers folks. :)","June 17, 2015","true","4.8"," 23 of 29 people (79%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","79","23","29","4","0"

Then, you beat procedurally generated dungeons and like any RPG, you pick up loot that lets you equip better items. You also level up and spend some stat points unlocking your character’s passives.\n\nBut grinding will only take you so far. This is all about skill. To beat some enemies you need to attack in a specific way, which gets pretty hard when you have to kill a ton of pixelated ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s.\n\nPlaying solo or as a party is cool, but PVP is awesome - you won’t even notice the hours shed away until you realize you’ve spent your whole day being a monochromatic stack of blocks. Test your proficiency against a skilled AI or just go with local co-op. Either is challenging and fun.\n\nNot being able to attack in all directions seems weird at first, but you learn to embrace it pretty fast. It’s a very addictive dungeon adventure that is still being developed by only one dude. And that’s awesome, but… it shows.\n\n6/10","July 1, 2015","true","4.5"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","9","10","0","0"

Took me a while to get use to the controls on keyboard and aren't bad with a controller. You can't really change the keybindings, there are 2 presets. The keybindings use the WASD and arrow keys as preset A and NUM keys with WASD keys as preset B (keyboard).\n\nPlaying for about an hour at the time of the review, there's not a large variety of monsters, but there could be many I haven't got to yet. The two bosses I've been at right now seem to have familiar tactics and AI. But that hasnt stopped them from being unique from each other. (Of course) They are different creatures, but are the same as the smaller versions of them around the dungeons.\n\nThe replayability is there, but may get old if you keep dieing. The dungeon will not change for a while until you die around 3-5 times before changing. Each time, you can get an item from (I'm going to call it the Chest) the Chest that makes you stronger. You can also upgrade the items with coins you find around the dungeons.\nThere are two modes you can choose from when creating a character, one will only make you lose XP when you die and the other deleting your character completely. If you are into rouge-likes, hardcore is for you. but if you just want to play and enjoy the game for what it is, softcore is what you'll want.\n\nThis game is interesting and would definitely recommend you to try this.","June 17, 2015","true","10.6"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","7","9","0","0"

A concept desperately missing from the cash grab game industry where a level 50 with stacked gear fights a level 20.  This feels like a game created by fans for fans.  Now just make a Bruce Lee style character with punches and kicks so Ican continue my commodore 64 flashback.","March 7","true","0.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Be prepared for those "Damn you, spider! Get over here!!!" moments.\n\nThe description of how to get passive abilities isn't that clear. Here's how it works: Every 5 statpoints invested into a specific stat will grant you a corresponding passive skill as a bonus.\n\n\n\nNeeds trading cards!!! :D","April 3","true","3.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Overall the game seems pretty balanced and the author is very open and responsive to feedback which reflects in a good quality of the game.\nWith the chance to get better items in every higher dungeon, leaderboards for highscores and ways to optimize stats for lategame characters, the game brings a lot of long term content and motivation. And last but not least its also a lot of fun to play the pvp mode local with some friends.\n\nAbsolutely recommendable game!","September 6, 2015","true","5.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
