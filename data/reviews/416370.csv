I say this is more a P&C game because really, there’s only about 3ish HoG scenes, the rest I wouldn’t consider to be exactly hidden object per se.\n\nIn this game you take the role of a man who falls asleep watching the movie “They Ate My Clapper”, and thus wakes up in this movie world, tasked with finding the missing crew. To be honest, while the story on paper sounds good, in game it was rather confusing. Alien artifacts, mind powers and mind control, horror? I’m not sure if it’s going for paranormal (which was my original assumption) or something else, and by the end of the game I’m still unsure of it.\n\nThe game has various chapters, all interconnected in locations (you’re not locked out of any of the areas), and a final bonus chapter which you can only access by completing the entire game. It’d be nice if they’d put an option to play the bonus chapter separately from the main story, and if they had asked/warned you about playing it instead of tossing you into it right after the main story’s finale, leaving you even more confused.\n\nThat said, and despite the occasional item appearing out of what I felt was thin air, the game was fairly logical. Meaning for most things you needed actual tools (a shovel for digging something up) rather than finding an oblique way to go about it.\n\nThe puzzles varied in complexity, some really easy, some much harder, some seemed to be more trial and error than anything, which was a bit disappointing. The main ‘thing’ of the game seemed to be the silhouette puzzles, in which you were to match an item with its silhouette via turning it around with arrows. It wasn’t too difficult, but after the first two or three times it lost its novelty and having to do them in nearly all the important puzzles got quite bothersome, to the point where some I just skipped to move along the story faster.\n\nOn the puzzles that require some note to complete, while you can’t hold the note up at the same time of the puzzle, accessing it is still easy and not as bothersome as in other HoG games. You also don’t have to wait to collect every piece of a puzzle before you put it in its place, which is quite nice.\n\nMy only real complaint was the jukebox puzzle, in which either I was missing something obvious or you weren’t really given a hint on when you were sort of heading in the right direction with it, which ended up making it quite frustrating for me. It was probably user error, but there you have it.\n\nOn the other hand, Mindhunters also had a couple mini-games which were fun to play.\n\nThe sound effects and music can get a tad repetitive, but they’re relatively nice and seem to fit the game okay. The voice acting, however, left a lot to be desired, even if they aren’t precisely the worst I’ve heard.\n\nThe graphics are quite nice, particularly the detailed backgrounds; the animations aren’t too bad, even if they could be a bit more fluid. Some of the scenes could benefit from a bit more research on how things look – for instance the driving scenes in which you saw the people from the front inside the car.\n\nI rather liked the quick travel map, even if I wished each section would have had its sub-sections as quick travel as well.\n\nAll in all, I quite enjoyed my playthrough and would certainly recommend it to HoG and adventure fans, even with the small downsides. I’ll be looking forward to see what else Phime comes up with in the future.\n\n* Key provided by the developer in exchange for an honest review\nFollow Completing the Backlog's Curator page for more reviews.","November 28, 2015","true","8.9"," 16 of 19 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","16","19","0","4"

I do not know how or why the developers, phime studios LLC, came up with that name for a movie, but for some reason it reminds me of every zombie movie and game ever made.  (They Ate My Brains immediately came to my mind.)  This is especially true when the first thing our movie herione, Gabriella, says to Nate is "The Mindhunters are after us."  No zombies though, unless being zombie-fied by mind control counts.\n\nStory:  Our hero, Nate, goes to watch the movie "They Ate My Clapper" quite often.  One evening he falls asleep and is transported into that particular movie's world.  There he meets Gabriella, a detective of sorts, looking to stop the Mindhunter and find/rescue the movie's crew who are making the movie "They Ate My Clapper."  (Paradox, anyone?)\n\nGameplay: In a word: challenging.  This is more of a point and click game then a hidden object game, and full of logic.  Everything is logical, the gameplay objectives and goals, and the puzzles.  It is the most logical game I have ever played, in fact.  No turning screws with a coin, there is actually a screwdriver!  It is also quite challenging, and only the most ... insane? would try this game on expert the first time though.  Some of the things that need to found are quite hard to find and I generally do not use game hints but for this game I highly recommend them when stuck. (Or use this game guide I found after I played - http://www.phime.com/showing-tonight-mindhunters-incident-strategy-guide/).\n\nDespite some quite subtle paradoxes, the game itself plays out as a mystery, and not as the movie plot though that is debatable.  There 7 chapters total, the last being what could be called "the bonus chapter" and 8 locations plus 1 location added for chapter seven (but only accessible through another location).  Each location is then divided into scenes which vary in number.  For example, the first location has 6 scenes.  There a map, a very nice 3D map for fast travel, but it is not really needed until chapter seven.\n\nThe Hidden Object aspect: There are only 3 actual word list Hidden Object scenes in the first 6 chapters, and 2 in chapter seven.  What the hidden object scenes are, are silhouette hidden objects or SHOs as the developer calls them. (6 in the main storyline.) This is very different from the usual standard word list.  A SHO is a group of pictures that must be located in the scene and once clicked on a "shadow"/silhouette appears behind the object.  The gamer then must rotate the object to match the "shadow"/silhouette.  This is quite the challenge, especially for those like me that lack skill with spatial reasoning.  Also about 5 clicks or so into rotating the object a red box appears asking if you want to skip.  Hmmm? I thought after a few of those, these little puzzles can be solved in less than 5 clicks??  It is true (look in the guide if you do not believe).  Most, if not all, are solvable in 2 clicks.  (They would have to be since 3 achievements (based on 1 minute time) are given for these SHOs.)\n\nPuzzles: My, oh my, and OMG.  This game's version of mini-puzzles include fixing a car engine, a driving test, check mating a king, geography, a crossword slider, launching a rocket and not 1 but 2 arcade games.  Absolutely nothing standard here!  I definitely suggest reading the game instructions.\n\nIn conclusion, one of the best games I have ever played and well worth full price.  I did get a free key from the developers, phime studios, (which I was very surprised about) for supporting their Greenlight effort.  Even if I had not received a key I would have still bought this game.  If they ever make more of this series I am definitely going to buy them, (and phime studios might since the game ended with 'To be continued'.)","November 23, 2015","true","23.0"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","0"

I'm often indulgent. Here, the frustration took over. I yelled at my computer each time the Do you want to skip message appeared after a few seconds in the puzzle. I was kinda distraught at the though that I couldn't find the right perspective. I was so close sometimes, but the fact that I have a little problem with spatial stuff was making stuff harder. So, yeah, you can go ahead for the challenge - the game is worthy. However, I'm still not in the mood to change my thumb down to a thumb up. For me, the experience was a disaster.\n----\n\nYou're at a cinema, watching a movie.... your eyes are closing and suddenly, you're thrown in the film. It's up to you to help the heroin find the last word of the story.\n\nThe game has a good plot, full of twists and the voice acting isn't bad.\n\nWhat is bothering me is the silhouette matching, which is a recurring feature. And when I say recurring...., EVEN FOR USING OBJECTS! I can understand for the hidden objects, but seriously.... I'm tired of these matching stuff... It's not at all friendly for people having problems with perspective or spatial orientation. I happen to have a problem to judge distances, which is annoying when I must park. I've also a problem with geometry. So, in other words, you bet that I had a huge problem to find correctly the right match.\n\nAnd when it wasn't the matching silhouettes, it was the DO YOU WANT TO SKIP? that appears in the middle of the game. Seriously, I'm trying to match, there is a SKIP button on the side AND you're interrupting me with a red circle and a question? Imagine I'm clicking on yes by accident. Do you realise that you've just thrown my chances for an achievement?\n\nAnd sometimes, I was left to wonder what to do. I mean, I'm playing on Easy, active areas are usually marked. Why do I needed to use hints to find those which weren't marked? How to play that mini-game? I mean, I have to click on the ? icon to have instructions, which sometimes didn't really helped me.\n\nAnd the popcorn.... sometimes, they're clear, sometimes, you don't see them and you're kinda surprised to find one despite your eyes not really catching them.\n\nApart that, the graphics are good as the soundtrack. But given the fact that I got very frustrated with the matching feature that is everywhere, with that freaking "do you want to skip" appearing FOR NOTHING, I'm kinda NOT really in the mood to recommend the game. I just hope that in Expert mode, you don't have that message appearing.\n\nIt was a nice try though.","November 21, 2015","false","9.0"," 18 of 28 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","18","28","0","0"

First of all there aren't that many actual hidden object scenes, there are far more of the silhouette matching games.  I personally was not that big a fan of these silhouette games and felt there were too many of them, but even if you do enjoy them the fact that a message pops up asking if you want to skip a few moves into each of them gets annoying quickly.\n\nThe puzzles are also disappointing with many of them barely being puzzles at all.  Some of these "puzzles" include finding the combo to a safe elsewhere and then simply turning the dial to open the safe, another is a spinning globe that you just have to move a lens over the listed cities.\n\nI found the story confusing to follow and poorly translated with a lot of awkwardly worded dialogue.  I enjoyed a lot of the artwork for the various areas in the game, but on multiple occasions even though I knew the correct object to use to solve a problem I couldn't figure out where I needed to click to get it to actually work without using the hint button.\n\nOverall while this certainly isn't the worst HOG I've played I can't really recommend it, especially at full price.  It might be worth picking up at a discount if you are a big enough fan of the genre.","December 14, 2015","false","8.8"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

After first viewing the trailer, screen shots and the store page summary, I came in with some high expectations. I was hoping for a fun, creepy adventure in my very own B-Horror film. Instead, what I got was a gimmicky puzzle system, horribly rendered cut scenes, an unexplained, unfulfilled and poorly-told story, and a complete lack of Hidden Object sections.\n\nYou play as Nate, an avid movie-goer who’s become somewhat obsessed with a new film, “Someone Ate My Clapper.” In fact, he’s seen it so many times that the clerk knows his name, and hands him the ticket without needing to ask. Once in the theatre, Nate falls asleep. He awakes just moments later, but not in his local cinema. Rather, he finds himself inside the movie. With the help of Gabriella, a character in the film, Nate must… actually; I can’t really explain the rest of this story. Because everything from here on out makes no sense. Nothing is explained, nothing is clarified, and nothing is elaborated upon. You’re either running about, completing random objectives without rhyme or reason, or you’re struggling to fathom how some of these puzzles made any sense.\n\nBut first, I want to start with some positive notes regarding Mindhunter’s Incident. The art work is fairly well done. It’s got the detail, depth and color to really shine. The game’s concept is also great. It may lose its charm a few minutes in, but I really like the idea of getting sucked into a movie and solving its mysteries. Also, some of the puzzles are decent and fun. Not all of them, but some.\n\nSadly, that’s all I found enjoyable about Mindhunter’s incident. And it’s a real shame, too, since I had such high expectations. But as far as cons go, there are plenty. Something I really must address is the Hidden Object sections. There are only three of them in this game. Three Hidden Object sections. That’s it. I thought I had missed some along the way, but that wasn’t the case. The game was so lazy that it repeated all three of them in the final stage. Did they not have the time to make more than three? Seriously?\n\nInstead, you get a multitude of these “silhouette puzzles.” They’re simple, rotate certain objects to fit a certain position, and that’s it. These were a nice surprise at first, but it isn’t long before they start cropping up everywhere. There must be at least twenty of these, and they all follow the same formula. Why would the devs devote so much time to these repetitive puzzles, rather than implement more Hidden Object sections? It just baffles me.\n\nVoice acting is awful, but I can’t necessarily call that a con. The game does take place in a B-Horror movie, after all. Honestly, I thought the bad acting was a welcomed addition. What I didn’t find welcoming, however, were the cutscenes. They’re all horribly rendered and look like crap compared to everything else. Not only that, but they’re accompanied by some of the worst animation I’ve seen in a long time. Characters heads bounce around in a laughable manner, everyone’s movement is awkward and stilted, and don’t get me started on the lip syncing. It just looks bad, end of story.\n\nSome of these puzzles are alright, but most boil down to finding an item, walking to a certain location, using that item, and then venturing out to do it all over again. They aren’t rewarding, nor are they fun. And that’s the key word, here. “Fun.” Mindhunter’s Incident just wasn’t fun. Instead, it was frustrating, tear-jerking-ly boring, and confusing. There are so many great point and click adventure games on Steam, and this most certainly is not one of them.","March 20","false","4.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

They carry all the sexiness of old point-and-cliick adventures but with way less labour and exertion to get things done. Hidden Objects scenes are always funny, trying to find all of the disguisied things scattered around often beautiful scenarios... it's calmly, relaxing, soothing.\nDevs for this game decided to replace HO scenes with a set of "silhouette puzzles" and my opinion is that they totally and utterly f*cked up. Silhouette puzzles are not funny. They are frustrating and boring and NOT relaxing at all.\nThis killed the game for me.\nAlso, I found the story made little sense, if any.

Before I describe the problem further I'd like to say something about the other aspects of the game first.\n\nThe story isn't great and the voice acting is pretty bad. The graphics are well drawn, but the animation of the characters looks very wooden even for a HOG. The music is quite good, but the sound effects (especially the footstep sound) get on your nerves very fast. Overall that would already make it an average HOG that I would have to think about if I would recommend it or not, but 'luckily' there is something else that makes that decision very easy.\n\nThere are hidden object scenes in the game. They are quite unfair (the kind that shows only the shape of an object and that shape is even partially hidden) and have some absolutely wrong labelled items (a flute is labelled as a 'recorder' in the very first one) in them. The game uses a very special (pun intended) other kind of silhouette based scene too. Sometimes when you use an object a screen with the object that you try to use shows up and in the background you see a silhouette that you need to match by rotating the object along all three axis. If that sounds not very fun and quite complicated to you, then you might understand why I'm not really happy that this kind of puzzle is the main feature of the game. There are even hidden object scenes that require you to solve up to five silhouette puzzles in a row.\n\nThis 'feature' is absolutely overused and totally kills the already quite mediocre game. Those puzzles aren't so much fun to base almost your whole game on. Overall the game just isn't good, but if you really like this one specific kind of '3D' puzzle, then I guess you might enjoy this game. Otherwise there are so many other casual adventure games out there that are just much more fun to play.","January 9","false","6.5"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

So many things in this game are wrong.\n\n- The story is just messed up and doesn't make any sense.\n- the mini games get extremely boring extremely fast, they are repetetiv and dumb even at the beginning.\n- the backtracking – always backtracking. It is so boring.\n- the „silhouette puzzles“ are a interesting enough idea – the first dozen times. But after roughly 30 of these silhouete puzzles, it is just annoying.\n\nIt is just boring and takes sooooo long. It is just a pain in the ♥♥♥, just look elsewhere for a enjoyable hidden object puzzle game.","May 22","false","6.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It was the first time I actually requested a refund for a hog game. The voice overs are terrible and the graphics are pixelated on wide screen. Also for me it's just not a fun game with a good story line. I don't recommend this game despite the other flood of positive reviews but try it for yourself and see if you want to take the chance. I did give it a fair half hour gameplay to see if it would get better but by part two I could not take anymore.","November 18, 2015","false","0.6"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

Even achievement hunters should stay away, as there are one or two extremely difficult achievements that make hundred-percenting this game a lost cause for most. If you want a good HOG, pick out an Artifex Mundi game, and don't give this one a second glance.","December 30, 2015","false","2.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Some puzzles would get completely stuck and would not work properly unless I rebooted the game. In one case an object in a scene was invisible until I restarted. And, even though I played the game three times to make sure, one achievement which should have been unlocked never was.","January 23","false","8.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/recommended/416370/","Usako","Usagi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Usako/","1581 products in account","Showing Tonight: Mindhunters Incident is an interesting game in some good and some bad ways. I personally did not enjoy the game much at all, and while it had its moments, the overall package didn’t grab me. First big thing: this isn’t really a hidden object game. I was quite disappointed with that and the gameplay in general.  The story was also weak.\n\nThe game’s story centers around Nate who goes to see a movie he’s apparently seen numerous times, except this time he gets sucked into the movie! The story plays out that he’s saving the actors from some villain, but if he was sucked into the movie, wouldn’t he just experience scenes from the movie? Nothing is really explained well, if at all- just something about mind frequencies and mind hunters...in the end it all boils down to aliens.\n\nIf the disjointed story wasn’t bad enough, the game itself is not fun. There are only three scenes in the main part of the game and two in the bonus chapter, which just reuse two of the same hidden object scenes. The rest of the game consists of mini-games and ponderous “silhouette matching“ tasks. In some instances, you must find a barely-hidden object then do the silhouette matching, and other times you have to do the matching just to use an object. Basically you’re given an object and have to turn it in different directions to make it fit the shadow. This is unique, I will give it that and some people may really like this part but I did not and found it very frustrating. I would not have minded these as much if they didn’t take up a bulk of the gameplay.\n\nThe game is also a bit buggy, at one point I wanted to exit the game to eat dinner and I kept clicking the Menu button for 10 minutes with no response, until the game let me eat. Another issue was expert mode, there is no hint button whatsoever, even if you’re stuck at a puzzle and just want to give up on it you can’t. If you need help trying to figure out where to go next, there is none. There is an official guide, thankfully, but sometimes I use the hint button just to be pointed in the right direction. The other two modes allow you a hint button but if you want the expert achievement you have to put up with this.\n\nIf you don’t mind the silhouette matching then I say buy this on sale, maybe. But the weak story, sub-par voice acting and frustrating gameplay all rank this as a “no” in my book, if you want a good hidden object game that’s not trying to reinvent the wheel then look elsewhere. I commend the developers for trying something different, however, and I hope to see more games from the studio.\n\nLunar Productions[lunarproductions.tumblr.com]","January 13","false","5.2"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","0"

I did like the "shadow" puzzles and some of the variety of puzzles in this one. Not many hidden object puzzles but the ones in the game were good.     Now.... I like fairly short hidden object/puzzle games with a nice story and interesting graphics to carry the story along.  Sadly, this story had great potential i think, but really never gets told.  Nothing to carry me along to the next area or to get "excited" about.  I ended up getting bored after a few hours and ultimately just quit; certainly not hard, but there are so many other games of this style that keep me better engaged. (off to play Nightmares from the Deep III...as an example).  Sorry for the thumbs down but....","March 5","false","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I got this as part of a bundle, and I still feel cheated. It certainly isn't worth the $5 they are currently asking for. The story is non-sensical at best, the characters barely have any writting at all. At times the point-and-click logic is so convoluted you will have to resort to a walkthrough or the in-game hint system.\n\nMaybe you could have some fun with this while playing it with friends after a few drinks, but only if you can get it on an extreme discount.\n\n11/10","May 29","false","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
