The controls are simple to use and the music and visuals are very nostalgic. If you've played the original game, probably one of the best and most notable things that they've done to update it so far is allowing for 8-directional shooting (up from the original 4-directional).","May 28","true","5.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

However the length of the game compounded by its rigid level structure leave it with relatively minimal replayability. I think the best comparison i can make is 5 gum, its amazing for a short period before becoming very bland quite suddenly. Dont get me wrong, this is one of my favorite games from my childhood but its just not big enough. 7.5/10","May 30","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
