No other game offers the same level of insane chaos this game can muster.\n\nFrom the moment it began as a mod after being backward engineered by Trix it was obvious to many that the potential was huge. During the beta tests Just Cause 2 Multiplayer gained a cult following and developed a keen audience eager to play and experiment with others in a massively diverse and interesting game world.\n\nPersonally I have played Just Cause 2 Multiplayer in so many different ways it's astounding that it really is just one game. I've played with friends experimenting with the grapple and laughed my head off. I've arranged Destruction Derby that were so successful the developers made a gamemode out of it. I've participated in some of the biggest, most insane mass racing, skydiving and faction wars I've ever witnessed in a game. I've performed solo and combination stunts with friends while co-ordinating over voice chat. I've went on a kill spee with my trusty sniper rifle and noscpoe killed hundred of enemies (other players at the airport).\n\nIt truely is an amazing game with almost no limitations: the biggest is probably your imagination.\n\nIf you thought Just Cause 2 was good then you're gonna be blown away by the multiplayer with 100+ players on a server.

As of writing this up, Just Cause 2: Multiplayer Mod is still in BETA, but it is also released to the public. Get your key at: http://www.jc-mp.com/\n\nRight now there is no story, no structure, no rhyme or reason, other than pure chaos. If you don't want to just run around mindlessly, hopping in vehicles, flying around, blowing stuff up, shooting random strangers, and seeing all hell break loose in front of your eyes, then stay away. For everyone else, come join the fun! As of now, I only see 1 server. But it is listed as X/3000 players. Yes, it would seem up to 3,000 people can be on this server at a time. I mean, how stupid would it be with just 64 players? Panau is big. I mean REAL BIG! Luckily, you can transport to different places at will with easy commands. /tp + the name of an area will instantly teleport you. For example: /tp airport2 will take you to a military airport, where you can steal some airplanes. That is if you don't get mowed down by other players first. There also other commands, like /fp which will actually allow you to play in a first person mode. And oddly, it works pretty well.\n\nSadly, the community for the beta is pure garbage. The chat box will be flooded with spam pretty much 99% of the time. So ignore it like a normal person would. Don't expect any questions to be answered within the game.\n\nThis mod of course piggybacks off of Just Cause 2, and the download is extremely small, racking in at under 20mb. Just make sure you have Just Cause 2 installed first.\n\nAs of now there are no real gameplay modes, other than the ability to join races. Everything else is just one gigantic and enormous free for all.\n\nSee you all in game!\n\nThis is just a small impression, and not an actual review. I will be doing a full review after the mod is officially out of beta.","December 9, 2013","true","7.1"," 27 of 31 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","27","31","0","1"

Depending on the server, you can usually just roam around and explore Panau at your leisure. To be honest, I use the game as more of a chat room than a game these days.\n\nOverall, if you're into unique multiplayer experiences, or Just Cause in general, this is a must-have.","April 1","true","513.3"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

You will have to purchase the full game in order to use this mod. What other gamers have done with this mod is take the Just Cause 2 gaming experience to a whole new level of multiplayer fun.\n\nPros    Hundreds of other players in one game world. Thousand players possible!\nServer commands like teleporting, first-person view, increasing vehicle speed, and much, much more.\nCustom game modes like racing, crafting, destruction derby, and tron all possible in one server.\nCustom shops that allow you to spawn vehicles, weapons, and server items for free or using the server currency.\nRoleplay servers.\nAlmost lag free on the most populated server.\nServer chat and admins.\nPassive mode if you don't want to be killed (but you can't kill anyone else.)\nCons\nIf there is lag between you and the other players, it will affect combat and some vehicle interaction.\nCombat between players is largely left to vehicles and snipers/rocket launchers.\nNot nearly as active as it was during beta testing or at release.\nThe map is so big that finding anyone outside of the main airport and some key locations may not be common enough.\nDonor only items and features on individual servers.\nNPCs may have been removed.\nConclusionI played for a few hours during the beta and then just now. A lot has improved since the beta but player count has predictably gone down. Still, it's hard not to have fun with this mod if you are looking to mess around with other people on a huge sandbox. I only visited one server during my play today--the largest one--but I'm sure the other servers can offer unique experiences of their own. Much of my time was spent playing the minigames like racing, tron game, and destruction derby. I also spent some time flying around using the speed boost console command (or key) to make cars fly and crash planes into other players.\n\nThe multiplayer that the base game needed is here in a very well done way.","January 23, 2015","true","16.8"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

A multiplayer mod for Just Cause 2. Now you can play with other people in Panau. Some servers have objectives, others don't. Gone are the missions, and all you're left with is a world to explore and wreak havoc on with other people. Here are a few reasons why you should get the MP mod.\n\n1. You're playing Just Cause 2 with other people. Honestly, if that isn't a good point, I don't know what is.\n2. It's free.\n3. The download size is like 30 MB (other than the space JC2 takes up). It won't take up much space and it's awesome.\n4. Some servers have some great stuff. AKA Boosts, which can make your vehicle go insanely fast, making boats fly and driving too much fun. Also, some servers have buy menus, where you can choose whatever item you want, whatever character model, which provides endless possiblities. Also, racing, manhunt matches, and teleporting to places in the map.\n\nThe MP mod is everything you love about JC2 but with people playing with you. The only "problems" with this is that it crashes like no tomorrow. It could be 5 minutes after launching the game, it could be 50. Crashes WILL happen, and the risk is heightened by boosting into walls and ♥♥♥♥, which I do a lot of. Also, the chats in the big servers are plagued with people arguing about alienware, so don't expect having a fun conversation. But seriously, if you have JC2, and you want to play it with friends, download this. This is basically an open-world romp you can play with friends until GTA Online comes out for the PC.\n","February 1, 2014","true","45.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","5","5","0","4"

The graphics are beyond good and are rendered pretty good. The unlimited possibilities in multiplayer mode allows for so much gameplay and the use of different types of vehicles in different terrains. The physics aren't to shabby and are actually pretty fun to watch your motorcycle fall from a cliff, plunge in an ocean,  or ram into the side of a building. You can practically drive a boat through land with boost of course. There isn't much storyline to the mod though but I have yet to get bored of the mod. Better than Just Cause 2 in my opinion. I'd recommend this game to those that want to screw around and ride fast through amazing sceneries. It's a favorite pastime of mine.\n8/10\n","October 26, 2014","true","33.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

The multiplayer mod is all those things as well - however...\n\nThere are no NPCs. That means no civilians to hassle or cops to hassle you. At first I was annoyed by this (what's the point of a sandbox destruction game if there is no one to stop you?) but I realized that in the bigger servers, other players function just as well as civilians and cops. The server I was in had over a thousand people, and the max capacity of the server was apparently 10,000 - but who knows if that's really possible. Anyway, some of those 1,000 people will be jerks and try to kill you for no reason, some will just want to blow ♥♥♥♥ up with you. Still, lack of NPCs might hurt long-term enjoyment of the game and will definitely make private/smaller servers feel like you're in a very empty world.\n\nThere are no missions/quests. You can still run around the country blowing ♥♥♥♥ up and working towards 100%ing the map, but the story mode has been completely extricated from the game. This, plus the previous point, means its strictly a sandbox game now. Make your own fun. That sorta thing. If you played minecraft for ten minutes, said 'what's the point?' and uninstalled, you probably won't like this and that's fine!\n\nThat being said - if you're the type of person who can make their own fun, you'll love this. Lots of racing ranging from the serious to wacky (I finished 17th in a 25-man limousine race). PvP and car hijacking from other players enabled. I was cruising along in my tank when some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ grappling hooked on top and yelled "GOGOGO" and then I drove us into a river. when we swam to the shore, he shot me right in the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ face.\n\n"Why?" I asked.\n\n"we ride together we die together"\n\nget this ♥♥♥♥ing game RIGHT NOW\n","December 16, 2013","true","1.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

And at the moment, this mod is in it's early stages.\nSince it's an early phase, you can expect a few issues (and I will list a few and explain);\n\n*Random Crashing\n*Online Lag (common of course)\n*Errors (I'll get to that later)\n\n=========Errors=========\nSome errors of the game are things like launching the game.\nI've had no problems whatsoever with launching but people do get errors of trying to launch the game like "Fatal Error" and the "DirectX Error". PcGamingWiki could have your solution  here. [pcgamingwiki.com]\nThe errors of the mod are easy to work around, some just can't do anything about it. Especially that it's only a mod, you can't expect it to be so good.\n\n=========Online Lag=========\nThen again, it's a mod. You can't expect it to be so good. The mod creators try to fix the game. But one common thing in most games will be Online Lag. The mod is not optimized at this point to be able to crush the Online Lag in this mod, and the creators might not be able to fix it (but have hope!).\n\n\n=========Random Crashing=========\nIt would be most likely you would happen to have crashed randomly during the mod. It's a bit devastating for the crash to happen as you were probably just doing something like vehicle surfing or just killing a friend for a bounty. The mod creators are most likely trying to fix this problem, and yet the mod is still in it's early stages.\n\nSo there are some flaws to this mod, but it's still in the premature period.\nI'd still give the game ago although as it is fun. Most servers (and I hope most servers) allow you to do such things as:\n*Change into a player model (let's say a Stripper? And I don't mean a female stripper...)\n*Buy Vehicles such as boats, cars & helicopters.\n*Run & Gun (to start a deathmatch?).\n*Drive Vehicles....\n*Grapple much?\n*Bounties\n*More driving...\n*TELEPORT!\n*Free-roam (of course).\n\nAnd these are the nice additions to the mod!\nOther servers will have other types of plugins for you to use...\nSo I'd reccomend giving the mod a go (in my opinion)!\nSo thanks for reading!","July 4, 2014","true","17.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

There are alot of different server where you can do things such as road tripping, assaulting bases, free roaming and much more. The big difference between this mod and the standard is that instead of playing alone which you have to do in the standard game you can play with either random people or people that you already know or get to know in Panau. Another cool thing about this mod is that you can host your own server and run others and your own scripts on it, which can make your or others server very uniqe.\n\nAnd also, if you are planning on getting this mod or if you already have it, and you enjoy playing in a group of players i'd recommend that you join the group called "UlarBoys". It's a military group only with good and serious players. Currently there is 56 members but we are hopng to expand. We use ts3 and we usually play during 16:00-19:00 gmt 0.

It is so much fun when playing with friends and just as good on your own. The grappling hook is one of the best features of the game and allows for easy travel as well as some awesome stunts. All of this, however, would be no where near as good if there was not the option of scripts to mod the game to your will. You can travel at insanely high speeds, make Rico look like a male stripper or spawn in any vehicle, weapon or outfit that you desire and much, much more. It amazes me how this is a community made game, not made by the actual publishers of JC2. Truly spectacular. However, it is not perfect as there are some issues of lag, different players seeing different things and other minor bugs but in the grand scale of things, dont matter in the slightest. In conclusion: I would 100% recommend this game to anyone who wants to buy it as it provides hours of fun and some great laughs as well.

The lag was terrible, shots wouldn't hit anything and the rocket launcher was insanely overpowered. Yet, despite all this I had the most fun I'd had in a game for ages.\n\nIn the subsequent beta tests the lag became far less noticable and in the prerelease version it was down to no more than internet speed. One should approach this game as something akin to Planetside 2; but as one constant battlefield, with no commander and the ability to spawn a Hercules Jet whenever you want. This game is the embodiment of chaos, and I loved every second of it.","December 16, 2013","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Connecting vehicles together with the grappling hook, flying to the outer space with your tank, doing roadtrips from point A to B, Murdering everyone with your fellow factionmates, racing/derbying for grand price and after that buying vehicles to drive off mountains. There's just so many things you can do.\n\nMultiplayer sync is great and very playable even with closer to 1000 players online at the same time. All of the in-game mechanisms work great. (teleports, racing, spending earned money etc.)\n\nI highly recommend to try this one out.

It is so much fun when playing with friends and just as good on your own. The grappling hook is one of the best features of the game and allows for easy travel as well as some awesome stunts. All of this, however, would be no where near as good if there was not the option of scripts to mod the game to your will. You can travel at insanely high speeds, make Rico look like a male stripper or spawn in any vehicle, weapon or outfit that you desire and much, much more. It amazes me how this is a community made game, not made by the actual publishers of JC2. Truly spectacular. However, it is not perfect as there are some issues of lag, different players seeing different things and other minor bugs but in the grand scale of things, dont matter in the slightest. In conclusion: I would 100% recommend this game to anyone who wants to buy it as it provides hours of fun and some great laughs as well.

After playing this mod even for a few minutes you will realize why this won Mod DB's mod of 2013. It's simply astonishing watching literally hundreds of players messing around the Islands of Panau at once. The options are simply limitless. Wanna race around the map with your friends? Fight to the end in a deathmatch? Or even just try to blow your mates out of the air in a plane or attack helicopter? It can all be done. Unfortunetely, it all comes at a price of lag and frequent crashes yet hopefully this will be fixed with future patches and updates. For any fan of Just Cause 2 this is a no-brainer, so go out and go play with your friends for a multiplayer experience like no other.\n\nWelcome to the jungle.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TickleGames/recommended/259080/","TickleGames","Tickle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TickleGames/","284 products in account","Just Cause 2 Multiplayer\n\nFor anybody unfamiliar with Just Cause 2 here is a brief summary. You are Agency operative Rico Rodriguez and have been dispatched to the wondrous (albeit mythical) isle of Panau in order to overthrow the reigning dictator Pandak “Baby” Panay using a wide variety of weapons and vehicles but mainly blowing ♥♥♥♥ up and using your grappling hook to break the laws of physics along with your instantly respawning parachute. Okay? Good.\nSuffice to the say when the game came out in 2010 it was pretty well received but it lacked any form of multiplayer or online experience. 3 years later and one small team of passionate develops later and now you can terrorise the island of Panau with thousands of other players, or you can just run them over with a neon pink bus…\n\nGood Stuff\n\nThis game was a lot of fun just playing on your own, when you add a server of hundreds of people to that mix it’s 100% unbridled chaos. Each server hosts a different style of the mod, at it’s base level the multiplayer mod features a system where kills earn you cash and cash buys you weapons, vehicles and player skins. In addition to straight up murdering fools for cold hard cash you can also participate in events that take place all over the, quite frankly, gargantuan map such as races and demolition derbys. Not every server is the same however, some will force the charge for weapons and such whereas others will have the store completely free, some will have god mode and others will have the ability to alter the mass of your vehicles. All of this alone is enough to make this mod great, but its true greatness comes from the players. There’s no doubt that this game is best played with a friend because it allows you to wreak havoc upon other players and each other, a personal favourite between my friends and I is throwing buses at each other at high speeds using the overly hilarious “boost” feature which is activated when shift is pressed and dramatically increases your speed to ridiculous levels (even allowing boats to fly across the map).\n\nIt’s not all about harassing though, it’s the random events that people create that drive the fun in this game. Starting a convoy of trucks and driving up a mountain to a ski-resort sounds like something you would find in Euro Truck Simulator but when it involves 10+ people all talking to each other in chat and occasionally hurling cars at each other on the way it stops feeling like a server with blank names and starts feeling like a community having fun which tends to be lacking in multiplayer experiences as of late. The norm tends to be people informing you that they have slept with your mother several times.\n\nBad stuff\n\nThis game has a huge map full of diverse and interesting locales and in the singleplayer it’s also vastly populated, in multiplayer however there are no npcs to come after you when you blow up a power plant, no civilians to hang from trees. I can’t really complain about this too much because the fact that the mod exists as it does is a great thing. I’m no modder and can only imagine how hard these guys worked to create this mod so I can’t hold something like this against them especially as the mod is somewhat in its infancy in terms of large scale play.\n\nSo…\n\nThere are some things I would love to see make an appearance as I said, NPCs would be a huge addition that would really have an impact on the way the multiplayer works and could lead to some great in game events like overthrowing a military base. Also if I could grapple other players to stuff that would be fantastic. Besides those two very minor things that are 100% personal I can’t really fault it, this is a fantastic mod that has breathed life into a game most people had forgotten about and hell if it leads to Just Cause 3 with a multiplayer like this built in I will be bloody ecstatic.\n\nTwitter - @TickleGames\nYouTube - www.YouTube.com/TickleGames\n","December 28, 2013","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After playing this mod even for a few minutes you will realize why this won Mod DB's mod of 2013. It's simply astonishing watching literally hundreds of players messing around the Islands of Panau at once. The options are simply limitless. Wanna race around the map with your friends? Fight to the end in a deathmatch? Or even just try to blow your mates out of the air in a plane or attack helicopter? It can all be done. Unfortunetely, it all comes at a price of lag and frequent crashes yet hopefully this will be fixed with future patches and updates. For any fan of Just Cause 2 this is a no-brainer, so go out and go play with your friends for a multiplayer experience like no other.\n\nWelcome to the jungle.

If you happend to mistype where you want to teleport to and it shows up in chat, the lonely hearts club starts showing up there like it is a free buffet of smarties for a bunch of fat kids and they just won't give you a break until you move on to soemwhere else.\n\nThe game will dump you for no reason and has a reporting system, so hope hopefully the developers pay attention to that. Once you get dumped a couple times in a row the game will run smooth.\n\nMy advice is get some freinds, get on Teamspeak or whatever you have and have laugh because it can be alot of fun.\n\n\n\n","April 1, 2014","true","21.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Just Cause 2 is a great game on its own and by adding Multiplayer to it, in my opinion is the best idea ever. Though after hours of mindless shenangans, I started to see which parts of the mod are clearly unfinished.\n\nFirst off, the government of Panau give no f#@ks about me blowing up any of their installations. The swarms of ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off Panausian troops that use to chase me around after pulling down a statue of their height challenged dictator are no where to be found. I see that the mod plans on using chaos to generate Panauan dollars that can be used to buy items off the in game market, similar to the core game is not completed. Currently the items in the item shop doesn't cost anything to buy and can be accessed and obtained instantly anywhere on the islands. This can be annoying in cases where you shoot someone out of the sky only to have them free-fall into a brand new aircraft and fly away. I am looking forward to earning the credits to buy these items, adding a bit of a challenge to the PVP. I hope they add more unlocks such as the different parachute skins, special weapons and vehicles as well as possible boosts.

If so, enjoy your 5 septillion FPS. Everyone else not running on a potato/toaster/shoe, enjoy ~100 FPS, or ~60 under load. Quite an enjoyable experience, although with the release players per server are down. This has the positive effect of reducing lag and increasing hit accuracy, but at the same time finding anyone at all in the continent-sized map can be a chore, and with no AI filling the streets it can feel more lonely than singleplayer at times. (This can be a benefit, as when you finally do encounter someone they'll be far less likely to shoot on sight, if only for the world to not feel completely alone.) The fact that the JC-MP team was able to create something this amazing from a singleplayer game is an impressive feat, and the 3+ year waiting time was worth it. If you already own Just Cause 2 you have nothing to lose by trying it, it's free and absolutely tiny.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TickleGames/recommended/259080/","TickleGames","Tickle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TickleGames/","284 products in account","Just Cause 2 Multiplayer\n\nFor anybody unfamiliar with Just Cause 2 here is a brief summary. You are Agency operative Rico Rodriguez and have been dispatched to the wondrous (albeit mythical) isle of Panau in order to overthrow the reigning dictator Pandak “Baby” Panay using a wide variety of weapons and vehicles but mainly blowing ♥♥♥♥ up and using your grappling hook to break the laws of physics along with your instantly respawning parachute. Okay? Good.\nSuffice to the say when the game came out in 2010 it was pretty well received but it lacked any form of multiplayer or online experience. 3 years later and one small team of passionate develops later and now you can terrorise the island of Panau with thousands of other players, or you can just run them over with a neon pink bus…\n\nGood Stuff\n\nThis game was a lot of fun just playing on your own, when you add a server of hundreds of people to that mix it’s 100% unbridled chaos. Each server hosts a different style of the mod, at it’s base level the multiplayer mod features a system where kills earn you cash and cash buys you weapons, vehicles and player skins. In addition to straight up murdering fools for cold hard cash you can also participate in events that take place all over the, quite frankly, gargantuan map such as races and demolition derbys. Not every server is the same however, some will force the charge for weapons and such whereas others will have the store completely free, some will have god mode and others will have the ability to alter the mass of your vehicles. All of this alone is enough to make this mod great, but its true greatness comes from the players. There’s no doubt that this game is best played with a friend because it allows you to wreak havoc upon other players and each other, a personal favourite between my friends and I is throwing buses at each other at high speeds using the overly hilarious “boost” feature which is activated when shift is pressed and dramatically increases your speed to ridiculous levels (even allowing boats to fly across the map).\n\nIt’s not all about harassing though, it’s the random events that people create that drive the fun in this game. Starting a convoy of trucks and driving up a mountain to a ski-resort sounds like something you would find in Euro Truck Simulator but when it involves 10+ people all talking to each other in chat and occasionally hurling cars at each other on the way it stops feeling like a server with blank names and starts feeling like a community having fun which tends to be lacking in multiplayer experiences as of late. The norm tends to be people informing you that they have slept with your mother several times.\n\nBad stuff\n\nThis game has a huge map full of diverse and interesting locales and in the singleplayer it’s also vastly populated, in multiplayer however there are no npcs to come after you when you blow up a power plant, no civilians to hang from trees. I can’t really complain about this too much because the fact that the mod exists as it does is a great thing. I’m no modder and can only imagine how hard these guys worked to create this mod so I can’t hold something like this against them especially as the mod is somewhat in its infancy in terms of large scale play.\n\nSo…\n\nThere are some things I would love to see make an appearance as I said, NPCs would be a huge addition that would really have an impact on the way the multiplayer works and could lead to some great in game events like overthrowing a military base. Also if I could grapple other players to stuff that would be fantastic. Besides those two very minor things that are 100% personal I can’t really fault it, this is a fantastic mod that has breathed life into a game most people had forgotten about and hell if it leads to Just Cause 3 with a multiplayer like this built in I will be bloody ecstatic.\n\nTwitter - @TickleGames\nYouTube - www.YouTube.com/TickleGames\n","December 28, 2013","true","16.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This is a free mod for Just Cause 2 that allows you to play against other players on the island paradise of Panau. Besides driving, flying and essentially crashing into things at stop speed, you can create factions, buy weapons and vehicles just like in single-player story mode. If you enjoyed playing the Single-player I'm sure you'll enjoy this mod.\n\nTethering your grappling hook from a plane to a truck while your friends are sitting in the truck will provide a great laugh. I almost forgot the "Boost" that every vehicle have that when things are going too slow. This causes vehicles to propel into the sky or whatever happens to be in the way.\n\nThe only gripe is that the game play might be a bit lagging due to the amount of players and chaos happening.\n\nPeace.","March 2, 2014","true","10.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The lag was terrible, shots wouldn't hit anything and the rocket launcher was insanely overpowered. Yet, despite all this I had the most fun I'd had in a game for ages.\n\nIn the subsequent beta tests the lag became far less noticable and in the prerelease version it was down to no more than internet speed. One should approach this game as something akin to Planetside 2; but as one constant battlefield, with no commander and the ability to spawn a Hercules Jet whenever you want. This game is the embodiment of chaos, and I loved every second of it.","December 16, 2013","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Connecting vehicles together with the grappling hook, flying to the outer space with your tank, doing roadtrips from point A to B, Murdering everyone with your fellow factionmates, racing/derbying for grand price and after that buying vehicles to drive off mountains. There's just so many things you can do.\n\nMultiplayer sync is great and very playable even with closer to 1000 players online at the same time. All of the in-game mechanisms work great. (teleports, racing, spending earned money etc.)\n\nI highly recommend to try this one out.

Once you've exhausted yourself playing the normal game after about 250 hours, you can jump over to this thing and be a part of more chaos than you've ever seen in single player. Janky as all hell, probably dependent on quality of the servers now that it's out of beta, but infinitely moddable with scripting itself, it's great.
