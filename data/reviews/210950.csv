Then there's food to eat and ale to guzzle when you're wonded from the slaughtering.  The multiplayer still works, though there are a few tweaks and quirks to fiddle with depending on whether or not you use a router or have custom firewall settings in order to play with others on Steam version servers.  There are a number of older version servers running and active that Steam users can join and play on.\nI recommend this game to anyone that likes full 360 degree splatterhouse games.","November 26, 2013","true","203.4"," 66 of 68 people (97%) found this review helpful","97","66","68","0","1"

I own the retail physical copy off of steam. )\n\nThis game.\nI love it so much you have no idea.\nI was much younger when I played it first, I was still getting innitiated into the amazing genre that is RPG games. It was times in which I was still going "oooh!" and "aah!" over stuff that was happening, trembling excited in my boots. And this game did all of that for me. The classic one that is, the one without halls of valhalla (which to an extent makes me not want to recommend you get this version off of steam).\n\nBeing a lover of nordic mythology even at that age, the figures that I came across during the single-player campaign are ones that I recognised and was pleased to see in a game perspective.\nYou might ask is the campaign any good?\nGood doesn't even cover it lad/lass. The campaign is flawless. It has very well done story-telling, good voice acting, great game progression, event/cutscene transitions. And amazing music.\nDid I mention that? This game's OST is one of the best you will ever find for a game. Ever. It really helps with the mood of the game.\n\nIf you are a person that enjoys playing RPGs with good story, and have not played this gem yet, I cannot recommend it enough. The combat is visceral, the graphics are satisfactionary for a game of its age. Hits strike true, making movement and precision vital tactics in combat.\n\nAnd here's another thing. A very important thing, too.\nI am a person that hates pvp (player versus player). But this game? I LOVE ITS MULTIPLAYER MADLY.\nI would spend DAYS playing it back in the day, in an internet cafe before I had my first computer. I had gotten so good at it infact, that I won 3 regional championships set up by hardcore gaming fans. They were not all about the money as championships these days are. They were about the glory, about the reknown. And that is the first and last time in my life that I performed so good in a game like this' pvp due to the love I felt for it, and how much I got into it.\n\nI knew that any multiplayer game I went into or hosted, that got people to face me, would be one I need not fear. I've gone into games where the host would intentionally remove all weapons from the map and leave people with their noob handaxe with which you spawn in MP games, and even with that, I managed to rack up the kills to the extent I was framed to be a cheater or hacker, and kicked.\n\nTake this from a person who has played this game aproximately 6,000 hours. Not kidding.\nYou need to buy this. This is a good buy for any gamer's library, unless this genre is simply not for you.\nBut if you must buy it, take my advice, and do not buy the version that comes with Halls of Valhala. It really messed up the game in several ways, switching up the special abilities (rune powers) of certain weapons, and other stuff, in favor of a "more balanced multiplayer", which only ended up making what was already very good into something unbalanced.\n\nIt is not my way to advise for a buy that is not on steam, but steam does lack the ability to buy some games without their expansions (like in this case), or is missing them all-toghether (like for dungeon siege, a game I cannot review since I decline to buy the base game without legends of aranna, which is just .. something that is needed.)\n\nMy final rating on this game is 11/10. There are few games that have a special place in my heart, and Rune sits on the throne in that place. Buy it. Buy it now. Retail price or discounted, doesn't matter. Its worth it.","November 7, 2014","true","3.8"," 30 of 33 people (91%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","91","30","33","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/recommended/210950/","Owlakki","Owlakki™ 6 days til birthday","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Owlakki/","441 products in account","Looking back on the early 2000s, there was usually one thing that most 3D games of the time had in common. The gameplay was occasionally very awkward, and for the most part they didn't age all that well.\n\nRune is one of the few exceptions to the rule. And it's almost fascinating how it's still a very playable and enjoyable experience today. Rune takes place in a fantasy world inspired by Norse mythology. What impresses me about this game is how interactive the levels are. It's a very immersive game filled with things like trees that react to the player running by them, bushes that move as you walk through them. All done before physics middleware like Havok, when everything needed to be hand animated in the Unreal 1 engine.\n\nWhile the storyline is pretty goofy, the combat is still very fast and viceral. It is a brutally simple hack and slash and this contributed to how well this game aged, and fits in very nicely with the Viking motifs that run throughout the game.\n\nThis re-release of Rune on Steam comes with a fix for the multiplayer, enhanced resolution support, and Steamworks achievements. In many ways Rune is the definition of a hidden gem, a diamond in the rough. One you discover one day, and wonder why you never noticed it before.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=484569919","July 18, 2015","true","13.4"," 23 of 28 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","23","28","0","0"

It may have taken me 15yrs but I have finally played it. So, what did I think?\n\nI freaking LOVE this game! It reminds me of Severance: Blade of Darkness/Enclave, which I enjoyed in my youth. Graphically it holds up all right and you can still make out what is what. The story is good and works to motivate you to continue, even if it is rather simple. The Norse setting and theme is good even if certain structures and characters don't always portray that. When facing other Vikings you get taunted with things like, 'I'm going to drink mead from your skull' and 'Look, a troll has wandered in from the cold', which adds to the immersion and causes me to smile.\nThere is much plat-forming in this game, with ledge climbing/jumping and rope/chain climbing. Some can be tricky but enjoyable.\n\nCombat is, well ok. Not brilliant but it gets the job done; satisfying when you hack/slice limbs and heads off. Enemy AI is quite shocking and sometimes they just stand still and let you kill them. This just makes me laugh, it was made in 2000 after all.\n\nOverall a great plat-forming, hack 'n' slash action-adventure game. It has its flaws yet I cannot get enough of it. Make sure to grab the mod that adds back the missing levels that were cut from the Gold version. Makes sense to play the full game.\n\n8/10","November 13, 2015","true","10.5"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","19","21","3","0"

It's basically a 3rd person hack 'n slay title garnished with some interesting jumping/crawling sections, here and there even with some simple puzzles. The action is raw and gory, decapitated enemies are a common sight too. Expect some pixel blood to flow.\n\nThe level design is pretty decent as well, ranging from mysterious, creature-infected dungeons over to goblin working settlements or viking-populated fortresses. Again, expect many severed limbs and other body parts on those premises.\n\nThe only downside in my opinion is the more or less unspectacular final section of the game and the ending. The developers could have done a better job, but some other players may have a different view on this one.\n\nThe Good:\n+ Decent story and level design\n+ Graphics (they were good at the time)\n+ Authentic Viking setting and atmosphere\n+ Fast-paced and uncomplicated gameplay\n+ Gore and Blood\n+ Multiplayer\n\nThe Bad:\n- The latest sections in the game feel quite unpolished and rushed\n\nThe Ugly:\n- Some issues on modern systems like sudden freezes. But I blame Steam for this, not the developers.\n\nOverall a truly pleasant hackfest experience, you'll definitely enjoy it.\n\n8/10","October 11, 2014","true","6.9"," 17 of 18 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","17","18","0","0"

Not many good and consistent ones out there, and this one brings its own identity in terms of gameplay, aesthetics, and character development. It creates its own accounting of Norse cultural and religious topoi in fiction, and that does more good than harm as far as the storyline progression is concerned. You play as Ragnar, a young man whose responsibilities escalate with the killing of his kinsfolk and the dooming of his birthplace, Wotankeld. Simple name for a protagonist, simple purpose for his endeavour. Vengeance couldn't be bitterer and more predictable.\n\nBut that's where things get sharp in Rune. You're introduced to fluent combat mechanics, advanced graphics for the time (the first Unreal Engine was just starting its brilliant run), and the grandeur of the game's environmental variety. This is a videogame epic tale, with all its classic characteristics, as the protagonist rises through the image of the savior and avenger of his clan and descends into the dark realms of Helgrind, imprisoned, assuming the figure of bare life and shamanistic sacrifice - true to the Norse notion of the Cosmogonic death in order to attain the knowledge of the Runes; Wotan speared onto Yggdrasil -, to then rise again as the ultimate Berserkr who transcends revenge and defies material existence. Ragnar is ready to put it on the line at every moment. And that motif is auxiliary to the development of the game's combat system, a hack-n'-slash which is as smooth as it gets, and a map configuration that challenges the player's reasoning as well as it puts them under the pressure of claustrophobia and constant darkness.\n\nThis is an atmospheric game, and a grim one as it is. The double ending is up to you, and that's a bonus coming from an action game with tacit storytelling elements. Rune scores high in both single-player and multiplayer - which is still active, and resembles heavily the fun and flow of the Unreal deathmatches -, and the variety of weapons, as well as the distinct styles and contrast in movement swiftness that each one of them brings up, enrich the game even further.\n\nA must-have for hack-n'-slash fans, as well as fans of games that dialogue with the epic genre.","April 8, 2014","true","15.9"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","0"

Depending on player actions at the end of the game it offers two possible endings.\n\nGraphical it's dated game but some locations still have nice design. Audio is done ok with average voice acting and some good backround music that is played in key moments of the game.\n\nCombat is probably the best part of the game with quite demanding skirmishes, often with multiple enemies.

But if you are bored of fighting with normal gear you can always grab a limb or head that your dead opponent have lost in the duel and use it against other enemies!\n\nThere's also multiplayer mode where you can prove your skills in the combat against other players.

The levels remind me a lot more of "Super Mario 64" than for e.g. "Heretic II" (another old game in a similar mood to "Rune" itself). And despite the fact some of the polygon models are by nowadays standard already more looking abstract than simple, it features some very clever ideas and attends to the detail where one wouldn't expect it in a game from that period of time:\n\nFor example you have three different weapon types to equip: swords, maces and axes. After an hour or so into the game you will encounter skeleton warriors. Try to hit them with the sword and it could happen you slash some heads off leaving the skeletons wandering around aimlessly. Or there are zombie like creatures you can hit for ages with maces, because they get up again after a short while. Here a nice and clean razor stile sword swing can come in very handy too.\n\nI haven't played very far until now, but what I can say is that this game does not feature effects as nice as in games like "Heretic II" (yeah, I know ... the same reference again - but it's the only game in this genre that has been convertet to Amiga, wich was my system of choice back then ...) but I find it much more enjoyable as it's somehow simpler in design yet strangely deeper in gameplay mechanics though ...\n\nAs I said before I'm not too deep into the game yet, but I hope it keeps it nice and easy to get into hack and slash feeling because I really HATE playing magic characters. Thank God this one here is more of a "Conan-Gameplay" meets "Mario-Style-Levels". And it's a very well tasting mixture that is.\n\nMaking the fun even better "Rune" is featuring some nice viking setting which isn't seen too often in a game nowadays and besides being very macho after all it gives the game at least a somewhat fresh gameplay experience.\n\nIf you like old school action games and don't mind the outdated graphics you should give this game a try when it's on sale.","March 14, 2014","true","1.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

The fact that this game is so old makes it even more fun for me to play even now. It's hilarious when you chop your enemy's weapon arm off, because now thay have no arm, so all they can do is run! In a multiplayer match you can start to feel super awesome as you find things on the map with high damage and other items that increase your health, and so on and so forth.\n\nThe game's graphics and animations aren't what this game is good for. Its great because the combat is so simple, yet so hard and complicated to use at times.\n\nEven though the game still has open online servers, no one really plays on them anymore. The people who actually play this game online is more like a community of 10-20 people who all know eachother because they met online in Rune.\n\nEven though the servers aren't really populated anyomre, it means that you can usually find a server and play it with your friends usually without the worry of anyone else joining it.\n\nEven if you don't like the multiplayer there's still an AMAZING storyline with a very awesome Norse setting, and it really does make you feel like an epic viking warrior. I won't spoil any of the actual storyline, but the story itself is very epic.\n\nThe story mode is also great because the difficulty of the campaign does start to get increaseingly difficult, but how does your character level up? Its simple. He doesn't.\n\nYou never level up with skill points, and you don't have an inventory, its just a hack and slash adventure going through the game. You get tougher by finding slightly better weapons slowly throughout the game, as well as items that increase your health a tiny bit and what not. But, even with those better weapons, enemies are still always gaining in difficulty, as they could still kill you in only a few hits. In the beginning of the game, enemies are no real threat and are killed easilly with your weak starting weapons. But near the end of the game, even though you have the best weapons that you can get, enemies are extremely difficult to kill sometimes and can take you out easilly if your not careful.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend this game to anyone, especially if you like games based on a Norse setting.","April 14","true","87.8"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

The story line has the player following the lone-warrior Ragnar in a vengeance to stop Loki and his evil minion Conrack from reigning Ragnorok. Throughout the game the player will come upon many environments that will give a lasting impression. The gameplay is intuitive allowing the player to engage enemies in a first or third-person perspective. The combat is fluid on and offline with a huge variety of melee weaponry. A rather small disappointment is the slightly trimmed campaign in the Steam "Classic" version. The multiplayer is fun allowing large team battles, arena battles, and even free-for-all but don't expect to find many players online. The multiplayer is also open to mods such as cooperative campaign missions, RPGs and custom maps. The graphics are great especially for a game made in 2000.

And I used to play this a long time ago in 2002 at it's time this game was considered "advanced" it's basically 2001's version of Skyrim (the only problem is there is no free roam,) but now things these days look close to real life I highly doubt this will compete with the other games you might consider getting. Now before I get into detail no not the kind of attention Halo: CE and Half Life get, this game is fun but that's about it there isn't a HUGE deep story behind this game so don't expect something like Halo or Half Life just expect the typical 1990 "kill everything in your path" kind of game.\n\nStory/plot: The story begins with an introduction saying Odin the all father gave humanity great powerful lucky charms--*Ahem!* I mean rune stones to hold Ragnarock at bay. However the evil god Loki has attempted many times to unleash Ragnarock by destroying these runes.\n\nSo instead of constantly fighting him every generation Odin had enough of his ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t so he ended up tearing Loki's heart out and banished him into a dungeon like hell. But even with his magic power stripped away and imprisoned he managed to corrupt a handful of mortals to join his wicked demonic army. This then leads to a showdown between the corrupt and evil vikings, and a village's chief and son Ragnar (you the player are Ragnar) so the village's best warriors were all slaughtered in merely seconds by magic bolts of lightning summoned by Loki's herald (I know I'm writing a review but there are no characters in this game besides Loki Ragnar and Odin so I can't remember his name currently) everyone dies including Ragnar's father.\n\nHowever Odin revives Ragnar and says that he is giving Ragnar a chance at revenge if he can save the rune stones and stop Loki's return. Ragnar of course without a moment of thought accepts the offer and fights his way through monsters, demons, undead, to hell and back all the way into the mountains fighting vikings, dwarves, giants, and the list goes on! you eventually become a war lord through your journey and now you must travel to Loki's dungeon and finish the fight the gods started.\n\nI won't spoil the rest but there is a lot to fight in this game which makes me disappointed that at the time we didn't have the proper technology to make a free roaming game. Because this universe has tons of potential! this is REAL norse mythology! not like Skyrim where everyone worships made up half naked bikini models that enjoy watching people bang. I would love to see more of this but in a free roaming world or at least an anniversary edition with new graphics and textures along with a lot of polishing.\n\nThis game may end on the very first installment but it deserves a modern RPG sequel (or prequel) anything can be done in this universe the IP is there we just need a new developer building or re-building this universe.\n\nMultiplayer: it's fun but very competitive, there is no "help me" or "power upgrades" or tanks, there is nothing to give you an edge over everyone else in the match. It's classic skill vs skill who is the better man? (or woman) basically multiplayer is thunder dome "two men enter, one man leaves...And respawns again to get his ♥♥♥ kicked" so it's fun but it's not the best multiplayer I've seen in early 2000 games. The other question you might ask is: "is there customization?" yes, and a bit of no, there are skins/playermodels (however you want to call it) you can change into but there is no armor customization you can unlock and dress up in, or mix and match pieces of sets. (I think there are skin mods but I'm not too sure they're safe to download) but if you want to mod in your own skin I support the idea 100% the game could use a fix here and there.\n\nFinal verdict: I'm giving the game a 7/10 now if this was 2004 or something I would have given it an 8 but this game is extremely outdated and old. So, does it belong in your library? yes and no, it depends what your computer can run. And there are better games out there that you can spend 10$ or less on. It's still a great game though, believe me I still love this game to this very day! but it's not a perfect game, as far as modern preferences go. I would love to see more, a complete free roaming RPG could be adapted into this universe giving a new fresh nordic IP, hell if it has Co-op mode, free roaming, and competitive multiplayer, it might even beat Skyrim! but until then we have to wait and see.","June 23, 2014","true","14.3"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/recommended/210950/","Brotmeister","Hans Brotmeister","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brotmeister/","352 products in account","This review contains events of the very beginning of the game and names a few enemy types. Other than that it is spoiler-free.\n\nRune Classic is a re-release of the original hack&slash game called Rune. You play as the young Viking Ragnar who just gets into the status of a warrior as the story begins. Ragnar's village is one of the villages that are built around special rune stones. Those stones were created by the god Odin to keep his son Loki in his prison and thus preventing the great cataclysm that would follow if Loki was to be released. The warriors of Ragnar's village belong to an order called the Odinsblade. It is their duty to protect the rune stones from all harm. When Ragnar is just accepted into the Odinsblade the people of Ragnar's village learn that an allied village guarding on of the rune stones is being attacked and immediately set out to intervene. On their way they run into the viking Conrack who was responsible for the attack. Conrack is in league with Loki and is hellbent on destroying every single rune stone to release him into the world. Due to the powers that were granted to Conrack by Loki the people of Ragnar's village are no match for him and he sinks their ship. Ragnar gets rescued by Odin and makes it to an undersea cave. With nobody else having survived the battle it's on Ragnar to keep Conrack from destroying the stones. But to do that he has to make his way back to the surface.\n\nRune Classic is played in the third person perspective. There are various weapons to be found. They are separated into three classes: swords, maces/hammers and axes. There are five weapons in each class, three being one-handed and two of them being two-handed. One-handed weapons can be used alongside with a shield. You can hold shields in front of you to block incoming damage but they also offer passive protection if you are hit on the side where you are carrying the shield. Shields' stability decreases as they are hit and they are eventually destroyed. Most weapons have different attack animations depending on the direction Ragnar is moving while executing the attack. Some of the heavier weapons like two-handed hammers are restricted to overhead strikes only though. If you have ever played Jedi Knight 2: Jedi Outcast you have a basic understanding how the combat in Rune Classic plays out. In addition to different speed, damage and attack animations every weapon has a unique rune power that can be activated using rune energy. Rune powers ranger can be offensive, defensive or utility oriented. The combat in Rune Classic also features dismemberment. If aimed well it is possible to cut off enemies heads or limbs. Those can be picked up and be used as weapons. While there are no ranged weapons in the game Ragnar is able to throw his weapon. Luckily Ragnar is able to carry one of each weapon in the game, so he is able to draw a replacement after having thrown his initial weapon.\n\nRagnar has two resources: health and rune energy. While he is carrying a shield the shield's stability is also represented by a bar making it kind of a third resource. Health can be replenished by eating fruit, lizards or meat or by drinking mead. Rune energy is replenished by picking up energy runes that are scattered throughout the levels. Different weapons' rune powers have different energy costs ranging from energy cost equal to one rune pickup to emptying the complete energy bar. Shield stability is replenished by picking up additional shields what is not very realistic but quite comfortable. The maximum shield stability is dependent on the type of shield Ragnar picks up with heavier shields obviously having more stability. Ragnar can increase his maximum health by picking up health runes which he can find from time to time. Some of the health runes are placed in obvious places while some of them are missable when not paying attention. If you find all health runes in the game Ragnar's maximum health is twice as as high as the initial value.\n\nThe enemies in Rune Classic features a variety of enemies. There are fairly weak ones like crabs or goblins but also stronger ones like undead, vikings, ice giants and dwarves. Even the weaker enemies are able to drain Ragnar's health pretty quickly if they land an attack combination though. Thus it is only advisable to stay next to an enemy if you know you can kill them before they can retaliate. Most of the time it is better to stick with hit-and-run tactics, going in for one or two quick attacks before retreating again. Alternatively it is possible to circle a single enemy to permanently stay out of their attack range. Depending on the enemy type this can be rather difficult though. Ragnar's life is not only threatened by enemies though since some of the levels are littered with traps. Some traps can be activated manually and used against enemies. However, the enemies can and will do the same if given the chance.\n\nBeing mostly about combat Rune Classic features some platforming elements. Those are fairly easy though because Ragnar can hang on to ledges an pull himself up. There are also minor puzzle elements like flipping switches or creating a path by destroying the environment. Ragnar is able to destroy certain doors and weakened walls or supports. If you find yourself in a place where you don't know where to go it is advisable to first look for something to climb, then for something to destroy.\n\nThe multiplayer is fairly straight forward. There are four modes: Deathmatch, Team Deathmatch, Arena and Headball.  While the first three modes are fairly self-explanatory headball revolves around trying to cut off the opponents' heads and then throwing it into the goal to score. While the game can be played online Rune Classic also features LAN functionality.\n\nAs opposed to the original version some changes have been made in Rune Classic. Some levels have received are slight redesign while some others have been cut out to improve the pacing and make the game less grindy. I can see why this was done since the game is fairly long and especially the beginning tended to drag. If you want to play the missing levels there is a fully compatible mod out there that restores them. Further Rune Classic introduced some new enemies into the game that before were only featured in the later released Playstation version. Additionally this version has gamepad support although in my opinion it is played better with mouse and keyboard.\n\nDespite being an older game Rune Classic pretty much runs out of the box. There are two oversights though. First depending on your operation system there may be problems with sound positioning. It is a shame since Rune Classic's sound design is even today very atmospheric. There has been an unofficial fix for this but that got lost after the shutdown of the site that featured it. If it re-appears this guide will be updated to include a link. The second oversight is a certain section very far into game where entering a cutscene makes the game crash, at least on certain systems. This can be circumvented by switching the game sound off until after the cutscene. Luckily this is a cutscene in which nobody is talking anyway.\n\nThere is on other minor gripe I have with the game. Sometimes triggering a certain event is required to progress. This is not an issue in most cases but some triggers are placed a little awkwardly. So if you don't know how to progress make sure you have actually been everywhere.\n\nIn summary Rune Classic still holds up pretty well. It is an enjoyable mix of visceral third person combat with a huge variety of weapons and powers and some platforming and puzzle elements. If you like hack&slash games or action adventures you should definitely give it a try.\n\nMore reviews here","February 27, 2015","true","35.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Probably but I could not choose since there is also Deus Ex, Diablo II, Red Alert 2, Hitman Codename 47 and so many other great games from that time.\n\n9.5/10 I'd suggest it to any viking, old school and action fans.","October 29, 2015","true","0.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

Early game is all about dodging, blocking, and timing your strikes, as even the most basic enemies will cut through you in seconds if you aren't careful.

I would love if there would be a remake or a new game Rune 2. The original game is quite long, but the steam version was cut down, so there are some levels missing - you can find them on the internet and download and include them into your steam version Rune folder so you will have the full experience.\n\nThe game has a very nice Viking nordic flair and I as a Viking lover was completely taken by it. I love the level design and the story is quite nice even though is nothing spectacular but its a nice Viking ride for Revenge and Walhalla.\n\nIf you like hack n slash games and you like Vikings and Nordic mythology you should give this game a go, it wont let you down.\n\nI pray to Odin for a sequel. Maybe they could take it to kickstarter.\n\nHail Odin!","June 18, 2015","true","18.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Gameplay is very similar to the original; however, there are a few noticeable changes.\n- In the single player campaign, many of the levels have been shortened and some have been removed completely.  This does help keep the game moving along (especially in the first cavern areas); though, fans of the original game will likely notice a few memorable areas missing.\n- A few new enemies have been added: skeletons, hellhounds, and frost giants.\n- Some of the weapon rune powers have been swapped.  For example, the viking short sword now has the vampire rune power, and the viking broad sword now has the befriend rune power.\n\nOverall, I still like the game.  The only complaint I have is that a couple bugs have not yet been fixed (as of version 1.10).\n- In the cave area just after Ragnar gets off the large beetle, there is a cliff area that will kill Ragnar if any items (weapons, shields, body parts, etc.) fall into it.\n- Near the end of the game, there is a cinema scene where the sarks are breaking through a wall with hammers.

At least that's what I thought.\n\nIt's rare that you'll see me come back to a game consistently in order to beat it. I've had more fun with this game than other 'combat simulators' such as Chivalry.","February 2","true","22.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For the time, I think the game is fairly accessible, and the combat is also quite strong. Other third person games from the time haven't aged well and have combat systems to boot, but not here.\n\nThe graphics are running off the Unreal Engine. I can't precisely pinpoint what version it is but by the looks of things it's the original Unreal Tournament and it looks surprisingly good for it's age. What it lacks in graphical fidelity, it makes up for in beautiful level design and great lighting. A lot of reviews here say to ignore the graphics but I think they're quite good.\n\nI think it's important to mention that the game seems to have been optimized for this release for modern rigs. I managed to run it at 1920x1080 and I didn't have to do any kind of behind-the-scenes tomfoolery to get a decent widescreen resoluton working - it all just worked right out of the options menu.

The level design is very diverse and the mechanics for knocking out supports, climbing, smashing doors, swimming, and even trampolines were quite innovative for their time and are still great fun today. It still boggles sometimes on how to progress through certain areas. You need to really concentrate on EVERY part of the environment to progress.

It was still fun. Nearing the end I was wondering if it'd be better if some of the scenes would have been shorter ...\n\nBut I guess we owe this to the age of the original game, back then I had much more time to spent, today I like to be able to finish a game while it is still hot ;-)\n\nSpeaking of hot, the game provides you with a little story, which is told in various ingame cutscenes (skippable with the ctrl key). It's nothing to fancy, but it was enough keep me entertained till the end non the less, mainly with its interesting background (I used steam overlay to lookup references to the nordic mythology from time to time, very interesting and it made me appreciate the game even more). Another thing I have to mention, is that this remake is well done from a technical standpoint, I played this with a resolution of 1920x1080 on my Windows 7 64bit machine and I haven't had a single crash or glitch*, the controls are very smooth and intuitive.\n\nAll in all I can recommend getting this game if:\na) you like hacking stuff\nb) you like vikings\nc) you played 3d computer games in the 90s and early 2000 and don't care to much how the game looks (it's an unreal engine game)\n\nWhen it was on sale you were able to get it for 2,50€ which is absolutely fair for the 10 hours of sp fun it provides (not counting the multiplayer - if you like multiplayer games like Half-Life Deathmatch, with vikings)\n\n* (well, actually there is a problem in one of the last levels, where a triggered cutscene causes the game to freeze, if you disable sound for that mission then you're fine. If you've reached this point however, you're so determined to finish that game, that this minor hickup probably wont bother you anymore ;-) )","February 26, 2014","true","14.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No wonder that less then 9% of buyers even finished it.\n\nThe game bases on some version of Odin-Loki-Ragnarok mythos however it does very bad job using the viking (or Northsmen) culture. You will spend on a ship about 2 minutes. No brutal raids on innocent foreigners, no social life at all and drinking mead is just a sad, lonely first aid kit. Its just a walking simulator with poorly designed battles.\n\nThe game mostly fits to the same category as Half Life (publshed 3 years earlier) - you keep walkin, jumping and fighting. Puzzles/jumping -> a couple of fights -> puzzles/jumping -> fighting and so on and so on. Unlike Half Life though the plot is very  simplistic and not engaging; the third person perspective destroys the illusion of every-man protagonist (who also never speeks and has no personality at all); most of the weapons are very similiar and you can basically  just hold to the latest-strongest weapon available; most of the enemies blindly charge at you (or stand in one place - the game is insanely buggy); and the landscapes are mostly grey, boring dungeons and mountain tunnels.\n\nIt wasn't a waste of time but I deffinitely do not recomment this game even though it has some great reviews on Steam (I assume nostalgia-based).","May 26","false","13.9"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","3"

Developers didn't really care about how much money they get from their games, it was just a secondary objective. They cared about their customers. They wanted their game to be as much bada** as possible. And at that time there weren't many expectations. What might look basic in this year, wasn't so basic at all back then. And these games sometimes have things that new games don't. It's really worth to try these old games! For this game: It's about a Viking hero, who needs to fight through Hel's domain and the dark dwarves' world to stop the end of the world coming faster than it should. The game's mechanics are great for its time and it would still hold its place. It's your standard slashing game with three types of weapons: Sword, Axe and Blunt weapons. And shields of course. Every weapon has its special powers, that you can use, if you have rune power, that you can earn by collecting runes, also you can raise your health with health runes, etc, etc....... So it's a pretty entertainig game! And it has multiplayer mode to offer, and servers a really easy to host, you don't even need a router!

Nothing slaps some hair on your chest like a good ole viking themed game.\nFricking Rune dude is pretty awesome\nI haven't beaten the game though I have put more than half a day into it so I feel obligated to review.\nAlso I'm trying to get used to typing on my new keyboard.\nIt doesn't shake my desk as much as my old one used to.\nAnway what should I get started on?\nGraphics. I'm not a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥. The game originally came out in between '99-'02, feel free to correct me if I am wrong. And this "classic" re-release like idk within the decade. I haven't seen what the original looks like but the update is apparently better so let's just say that. Character's faces are emotionless and have robotic jaws but whatevs, it holds up well enough. There are way worse looking indie games that came out last yesterday. Textures are sharp enough. Whatever that means. Lighting is pretty nice, FOR SUCH A DARK GAME. Seriously, I felt like I was playing Doom 3 when marching through Hel. Levels are lengthy, and vary in look and theme. So far, I've pillaged through a village in Midgar, the depths of an aquatic underworld, Hel, herself's realm, and are conquering a snowy fortress right now.\nStory, from what I can tell so far, is simple, yet not bad. You play as young, 'roided up, unbearded, lad, named Ragnar, who is given the honor of being a guardian of one of the Runes that Odin placed around Midgar. Some dude, Conrack, I think his name was, wants to harness the power of the Runes to unleash Loki, and initate Ragnarok. Conrack then, kills Ragnar and his family and friends, battle buddies, thanes, whatever. Odin brings Ragnar back to life, for him to seek revenge and tadaaa. Kill stuff.\nGameplay consists of drinking mead, beating guys to death with their friends' dismembered arms, dying, getting frustrated at your computer, and the occasional platforming segment. Combat feels like an Elder Scrolls game's melee combat in 3rd person. Minus killcams and leveling up. Left click hurts things, right click keeps things from hurting you. Enemies react appropiately to where they are hit, most of the time, such as being able to decapitate enemies with one lucky slice or destroying their shields when you happen to hit it while the shield isn't drawn. You have 3 weapon categories, sword, axe, and mace, and each weapon comes with their own rune power, such as an axe that can life-steal or sword that can harness the power of Grayskull. You might also die a lot. It's the Dark Souls of yesteryear.\nNow onto the audio aspect of the game. From what I've noticed, there is hardly any music but when there is, its not too terrible. Same goes for voice acting. Enemies and Ragnar make crunchy noises and scream when harmed that are higher quality than Two Worlds II.\nIn a nutshell, while the combat is no God Of War Ascension, graphics are not Battlefield 63, and music isn't produced by Amon Amarth, you should still buy this game if you're interested in it. Don't even wait until its on sale. Grow yourself a beard, kick down a door, drink some mead, and buy this game. There basically no viking games and this one is a lot of damn fun, so why not.","May 3, 2014","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can run around and fight up close or throw you weapons at people and behead them. Oh also forgot you can use your opponets own limbs and kill them! You can use choped off arms and heads as weapons too and throw them around! This game was so fun I played countless hours of mutiplay.  I recommend to try it out your missing on a classic of a game.

Beat your enemies to death with it. or B. throw it at another vase monster and it will react to it and most likely start feasting on his own fallen brother. the locations are where the game REALLY shines as you're put into many different crazy scenarios from sunken ship recks to gladitorial arenas and then even HELL itself.  bottom line is this game is 10/10 on almost all levels, had to tweak controls in the beginning but that is more common for older games. still great never the less. buy it at ease if you really want it or wait for it to go on sale for $2.75 or $5.","March 2, 2014","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Nothing slaps some hair on your chest like a good ole viking themed game.\nFricking Rune dude is pretty awesome\nI haven't beaten the game though I have put more than half a day into it so I feel obligated to review.\nAlso I'm trying to get used to typing on my new keyboard.\nIt doesn't shake my desk as much as my old one used to.\nAnway what should I get started on?\nGraphics. I'm not a graphics ♥♥♥♥♥. The game originally came out in between '99-'02, feel free to correct me if I am wrong. And this "classic" re-release like idk within the decade. I haven't seen what the original looks like but the update is apparently better so let's just say that. Character's faces are emotionless and have robotic jaws but whatevs, it holds up well enough. There are way worse looking indie games that came out last yesterday. Textures are sharp enough. Whatever that means. Lighting is pretty nice, FOR SUCH A DARK GAME. Seriously, I felt like I was playing Doom 3 when marching through Hel. Levels are lengthy, and vary in look and theme. So far, I've pillaged through a village in Midgar, the depths of an aquatic underworld, Hel, herself's realm, and are conquering a snowy fortress right now.\nStory, from what I can tell so far, is simple, yet not bad. You play as young, 'roided up, unbearded, lad, named Ragnar, who is given the honor of being a guardian of one of the Runes that Odin placed around Midgar. Some dude, Conrack, I think his name was, wants to harness the power of the Runes to unleash Loki, and initate Ragnarok. Conrack then, kills Ragnar and his family and friends, battle buddies, thanes, whatever. Odin brings Ragnar back to life, for him to seek revenge and tadaaa. Kill stuff.\nGameplay consists of drinking mead, beating guys to death with their friends' dismembered arms, dying, getting frustrated at your computer, and the occasional platforming segment. Combat feels like an Elder Scrolls game's melee combat in 3rd person. Minus killcams and leveling up. Left click hurts things, right click keeps things from hurting you. Enemies react appropiately to where they are hit, most of the time, such as being able to decapitate enemies with one lucky slice or destroying their shields when you happen to hit it while the shield isn't drawn. You have 3 weapon categories, sword, axe, and mace, and each weapon comes with their own rune power, such as an axe that can life-steal or sword that can harness the power of Grayskull. You might also die a lot. It's the Dark Souls of yesteryear.\nNow onto the audio aspect of the game. From what I've noticed, there is hardly any music but when there is, its not too terrible. Same goes for voice acting. Enemies and Ragnar make crunchy noises and scream when harmed that are higher quality than Two Worlds II.\nIn a nutshell, while the combat is no God Of War Ascension, graphics are not Battlefield 63, and music isn't produced by Amon Amarth, you should still buy this game if you're interested in it. Don't even wait until its on sale. Grow yourself a beard, kick down a door, drink some mead, and buy this game. There basically no viking games and this one is a lot of damn fun, so why not.","May 3, 2014","true","15.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As a budget title it's a welcome trip into nostalgia for those of us that still remember that games are not all about eye candy. It's just a shame we don't often see modern games of this ilk any more and that, good points aside, the graphics remain a serious drawback that stop it reaching its true potential.
