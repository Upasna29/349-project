I've played pool since I was 5.. That's 50 years of pool under my belt.\nI've never run across such BAD PHYSICS in a game in my life! Not even with DOS based games from the nineties has a game ever had such bad physics simulation.\n\nAside from the fact that there's literally NO ONE online to play with. Waiting for 15 minutes for a match is unheard of.\n\nDon't waste your time on this one.\n\nSteam... you guys should really try the games you decide to go Green on.

Alas, it leaves much to be desired, based on the version up to and including the patch on 16th March. See below:\n\nPROS:\n\n- It's fun enough to play while watching the telly, for a time, and if you've nothing else to do.\n- It's free.\n\nCONS:\n\n- Extremely derivative: It's a pool game clone, and a poor one at that. It is outdone, not only by the majority of browser-based pool games, but also by the likes of Arcade Pool for the Amiga, which is now over 20 years old.\n\n- Putting spin on the ball has barely any effect whasoever. This needs to be ramped up significantly. I enjoy playing pool, though i consider myself an amateur, and even i can put triple the amount of spin on the cue ball as this game allows. As such, many shots which would be easy enough in real life (and most other pool games) are impossible here.\n\n- Only one mode of play: 8-Ball\n\n- Poor matchmaking, which can mean waiting forever for a game, even when there was an odd number of people in the sparsely-populated rooms. I've left it running for about 8 minutes without getting a game. However, exiting out of the room and rejoining seemingly got me a game much quicker than just waiting in the queue, indicating a glitch.\n\n- The "hit boxes" for the balls are clearly some way off. It is possible to hit an opponents ball when, very clearly, you should have hit your own ball first.\n\n- Although the latest patch states that you should "win" the game if your opponent disconnects, this isn't the case. I've lost my stake through no fault of my own because i've had to leave a game that my opponent disconnected from.\n\n- Sometimes, you can not pot any balls, and miraculously, it is your go again. Obviously, this is particularly annoying when it happens for your opponent.\n\n- The physics still need some work, even after 2 or 3 hotfixes.\n\n- The actual proper rules of 8-ball pool are not taken into consideration, e.g. at break-off, snookering behind a played balll without hitting a cushion/rail first.\n\n- Syncing issues which can cause you to lose time through no fault of your own.\n\n- Graphical glitching at the menu and room screens.\n\n\nI don't like writing reviews like this, but the fact of the matter is that this game is outdone by just about every other pool game available, and is at best a bare-bones pre-alpha. It could end up working, but at the minute, it isn't worth recommending, even for nothing. There are plenty of other, much more worthy, free, online multiplayer pool games out there that you could be playing.","March 16","false","11.5"," 48 of 58 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","48","58","3","0"

Me and my friend found a bug that makes your opponent's time run out even if he shot the ball. the speed is terrible. even with max speed the ball doesn't move that quickly as it should to actually hit bank shots. the game is copy of 8ball pool but the creators said that they are going to add new gamemodes such as 9ball. I know those glitches might not be glitches in your opinnion but we tested the time runout glitch with 2 over  200mbps download and 50mbps upload nets with 5-7 ping. The ''bags'' you are hitting balls are WAYYYYY too big, seems like the game has box colliders. I would rate this game 3 out of 10. 3/10.","March 14","false","1.2"," 49 of 66 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","49","66","2","7"

It has the worst reality in every pool games i played. The balls go with a incredible speed and suddenly they stop in the middle of the table, the movements aren't real at al...even if you shoot with medium force it stops in the middle of the target making you have to shoot with max force when it shouldn't be supposed to.\nAlso the fact that the minimum value you have to play is 50 coins and you start with 250 coins makes you with short selection of choices when you start to play and , in a low quantity of games you can lose everything , even with the lowest entry possible.\nOther thing is bugs when you are searching for a game and it suddenly goes down , one time it even consumed my 50 coins because a match was found and i was redirected to the main menu.\nThe last thing is also negative but not really a reason to criticize since the game is new , but the time you need to find a game is boring as sh*t\n\nPros:\nAchievements\nFree\nMultiplayer/Local games/Challenge friends\nMany thing to costumize\n\nCons:\nBugs/Glitch\nIrrealistic physics\nCopy of the well known 8-ball Pool\nHard to find a game\nLack of coins / Needs more options with lower values.\n\nIn my opinion you should try it just to see how it is , but i don't recommend it to play "everyday" as i recommend most of the games I played. Compared to other pool games , this one gets slightly behind.\n4/10\n\n[EDIT:Was playing a game with my last 50 coins , the game crashed and now i can't play for free?]- This problem is now solved in the new patch , but still need to wait 1 hour to get coins.\n\n[EDIT2: In the new patch they say the physics are better ( hopefully they are trying to improve due to the reviews) will try it later to see if it is any better now]","March 14","false","4.0"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","82","32","39","3","0"

It's not bad, its just not good. I will not be recommending this game as its not worth the harddrive space. It takes forever to find a match, although it has only be available for less than 48 hours. I've found mystery 'bumps' on the table, where the cue ball will suddenly change direction after hitting this 'bump'. Not that I expected any different, but the micro payment gaming is truly killing the entertainment value of today's and future games. but yea.

It just launched on Steam+it is free to play so of course there will be some bugs or unbalanced things, anyone with at least few active brain cells will understand that and won't hurl bad reviews instantly. So far, there are updates going on every day, fixing and balancing a lot of stuff, I personally wrote an email to the devs regarding getting stuck when opponent disconnects, and it got fixed the very next day I believe. Coincidence? Maybe, but it has been fixed and that's what matter to me. Just hold on with the reviews and give them few weeks, you'll see this game is above "Mostly Negative" status.

A quick game of pool is just one click away, no need to think about settings things up - just click and play. On the other hand it feels like there's a lot of missed potential: game modes, custom game settings (no aim assist for either player etc.), score lists and matches (e.g. play five games against a friend in challenge mode and keep score). Maybe the game should have been named Simple Pool instead of Premium Pool because that name would have been more descriptive for this exact game.\n\nPros:\n+ It's free to play\n+ Simple and quick to play\n+ Simple match-making\n+ Challenge mode\n\nCons:\n- No game modes\n- No game setup possibility\n- Shop prices feel quite high - there should be more mid-prized content\n- Not enough basic avatars (everyone I play against has the same face - quite tiring)\n- Just not enough content and features overall","March 17","true","3.4"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

This game is a good pool simulator that will quickly grab your attention. Although, there are some cons about this game  that you really should know before getting this game.\n\nMost games have a way for you to practice the gameplay that you will come across while playing. When you think of this, you imagine a trainer that is going to go easy on you and you slowly start to get better as you continue! But no! Not this game! The practice mode isn't any easier than playing the regular game itself! In fact, it is probably harder than playing against a high-leveled player! The practice mode is pretty much just a computer with AimBot, and this bot perfectly makes every single shot without even taking more than 5 seconds to think! When I was doing the practice, I honestly began to wonder why these people even added a practice mode! I also wondered why this bot isn't at the top of the leaderboard... Not only that, but the practice mode always makes you hit the ball first, pretty much giving the bot a 95% chance to win without you even being able to do anything in the game! At that point, I wanted to repetitively bang my head against my desk!\n\nShouldn't most games be able to connect you to a game or game lobby within a matter of seconds. Most games I know do that, but nooooooooo. Premium Pool not only has a huge problem connecting with other players to start a match, but it also has a problem staying connected. In order to get into a match, you have to pay coins, and if you lose connection, you also lose the coins! I was expecting to have an estimated 5-10 seconds to connect to a match, but this game can take 20 seconds up to a minute just to connect to a match with another player. I was able to go downstairs, pour myself a glass of water, drink it all, and successfully make it back to my computer before this game even connected to a match!\n\nYou thought it ended there? I didn't mention this game has huge amounts of lag? You could hit the cue ball in the opposite dirrection of the hole, and a lag spike will bring the ball right back and give you another chance. This game crashes more than a 2 year old flying an RC Helicopter! I didn't even know it could get that bad...\n\nIn conclusion... you will have an easier time getting a whale halfway across the earth than trying to play this game. Hopefully this helped you all! ;)","April 19","false","5.3"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","4","6","2","0"

(seriously annoying when you have a timer about to run out)\nWhen aiming it felt like it was snapped to a certain degree. (i dont know if this was just me but it was annoying)\nConnection meant you would run out of time instantly after reconnection.\n\n\nOverall the game is decent because all of the cons are only minor and not game breaking its still enjoyable but its just not all there so i dont reccomend it.\n6/10\n\nI also saw somthing interesting in the store if you want 5 new bits of text to display on screen to your challenger you can pay up to £5 is it just me who thinks thats kind of a rip off.\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOk so the game improved since i made the negative review and its acctually alot better now most of the cons are gone so now i would reccomend this game go play it.

Stop making this game so bad, thats probably a reason why people dont download it.\n\n- I would pay money too, (up to 20+$) if some changes happen:\nBetter controls, Key-bindings, Offline-Tournament with better KI and maybe improve graphics/controls.\n\n- Result:\nYou get a free game which you can play online.

And I expected it to be like OMGPOP's billiards or facebook's billards (both of which are made in Flash).\nBut unfortunately when I entered a game, it didn't feel like geniune billiards.\nIt was a disappointment.\nWhen the balls collided, it didn't make the satifsying noise that pool balls make.\n\nThere are only 2 avatars that are you start with: a male and a female. Both of the avatars look repulsive. The only avatar that has any appeal is the one named Meister.\n\nSo in the one game that I did play, the opponent hit a stripped ball towards one of the pockets. The ball was about 0.75 pool ball lengths away from going into the pocket when it was almost at a complete stop, and then it just magically goes in. In the match, it looked like one of the balls jumped over one of the other balls. I didn't do the pratice so I did not expect to see that. It looked like the pool ball randomly jumped backwards over the ball that hit it.\n\nI ended up winning the match as expected, but it wasn't enjoyable or satisfying.\n\nThe game starts you off with 250 coins/chips and it costs 50 to enter a basic match. You will feel asif there is absolutely no power being your pool stick, but you will see the balls slide across your screen. I do not like how it costs coins/chips to play the game. Sure, it would be fine to gain coins/chips when winning or losing, but you literally have to have them to play the game.\n\nI rate this game a 2/10.","April 4","false","0.2"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","2"

But, its free so, that somewhat excuses some issues.  However, connectivity seems to be an issue.  Its rather difficult to connect to players in online mode.  Apparently that is being worked on by the devs.\n\nYou start off with 250 gold coins and you can purchase more through steam.  So, to that extent, its a pay to play sort of set up.....unless, of course, you can join some of the lesser lobbies and win some GC 50 to 100 at a time.  At that rate, however, it will take quite a few games to purchase some of the low level items in the store.\n\nAs far as game play and the physics etc, its not bad.  The aiming lines help but, without them, making shots is nearly impossible without a lot of practice.....and I mean A LOT OF PRACTICE.\n\nFrom what I can see, 8 Ball is the only game vairant available at this time.  I would rather have seen the game start off with 9 Ball.  But, that's really a matter of personal preference, I suppose.\n\nSince the game is free, I will recommend it.  Its not a bad start to a game that has some decent, but, limited potential.

It isn't a game-breaking bug, but it's one of those small annoyances that still needs fixing.\n\n4/27/2016 EDIT: Recently I've come across another problem with this game: very frequent game freezes which usually results in me having to restart the game.(No, it is not my computer; my computer is brand new and has perfectly handled games much more sophisticated than this.) Another issue that has become increasingly common is that it is almost impossible for me to connect to the online play, so my only option is to play offline unless this fixes itself(which is very rare, despite me restarting the game several times.) I am aware that other people have connection issues with this game as well, based on other user reviews.\n\nORIGINAL: While Premium Pool has many flaws and issues, I recommend Premium Pool despite these issues only because it is *free* and fun when the issues are not affecting your gameplay significantly. However, I do not recommend spending money on this game at all. Most(if not all) of the items purchased with real money are only for looks and cannot be profitted off of nor do they affect your performance in the game. Plus, I wouldn't spend money on this game due to some of the big issues the game has.\n\nSome of the issues I noticed in my first session playing Premium Pool:\n- It is nearly impossible to play against your steam friends, because the game always has trouble connecting.\n\n- Due to very few players actively online on Premium Pool, it is very common to be pinned against other players who are not anywhere near your own skill level. This can make it hard for new players by forcing them to play against the more experienced ones, and allow the more experienced players to money farm off of the newer players. This leaves the less experienced player with little to no cash left.\n\n- Lots of in-game purchases required to get almost all of the better stuff(a separate currency that can only be purchased with money is used to buy nearly all of the non-newbie gear.) However, this does not make the game pay to play. It works perfectly fine without making in-game purchases.\n\n- Looks very similar to many other "Pool" games all over the web with not much difference between Premium Pool and all the others.\n\nPros:\n- Very fun when you get good matchmaking and don't get utterly decimated by an opponent 10 levels ahead of you.\n\n- Pretty easy to get the hang of this game, also a very relaxed and friendly environment.\n\n- Good community(from what I saw), for all the people I played against, I enjoyed menu chatting back and forth with them, especially with small taunts such as saying "Thanks." when they pot the cue ball.\n\n- Fun to play if you don't have enough time for more sophisticated games such as RPG's. The matches are fairly quick and a timer prevents players from taking too long on their shots.\n\n- Lots of cool looking cues, table designs, arenas and more.(Unfortunately though, most of them cost an in-game currency that can only be obtained by purchase.)\n\nI would personally recommend "8-Ball Pool" by Miniclip which can be found both online and on the App Store. It's basically this but stepped up about five levels with minigames, great matchmaking, easy multiplayer against friends & family and different cues & ranks that offer not only just cooler looks but more speed, power, and so on.\n\nI hope any readers take my review into consideration! :D","April 17","true","2.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","3","7","2","0"

It takes forever to find an opponent, and then the server either drops before the game starts or the game will disconnect halfway through the match.

Me and my friend found a bug that makes your opponent's time run out even if he shot the ball. the speed is terrible. even with max speed the ball doesn't move that quickly as it should to actually hit bank shots. the game is copy of 8ball pool but the creators said that they are going to add new gamemodes such as 9ball. I know those glitches might not be glitches in your opinnion but we tested the time runout glitch with 2 over 200mbps download and 50mbps upload nets with 5-7 ping. The ''bags'' you are hitting balls are WAYYYYY too big, seems like the game has box colliders.

Insanely bugged. Multiple game breaking bugs present that you are very unlikely to go three matches and not have the game break.\n2. No free coins. Coins are relatively cheap to buy, BUT if you run out, you are SOL without $$. So the 10 million achievement is basically impossible.\n3. Not realistic physics. Its very simulated, and creators have not palyed near enough IRL pool. REAL pool on break you can potentially get the majority of the balls back on the kitchen side (side you break from), in this game you are INSANELY lucky if you get more than 2 balls to really move.\n4. Game does not update. Its really strange to see 24 people in the first bracket and 7 in the second, and it never changes. If you join the second you won't be paired right away which you need 2 people to play. When you go back to the main screen it will still say the same amount of people.\n\nConclusion: Nothing is being done to fix the major issues, this game is not worth spending $$ or time.\n\nTo list some of the game breaking bugs.\n-If you end the game in the middle of a match, the match will be "Cancelled" and neither player loses or wins.\n-The person can leave and their timer never finish, thus you lose because your only option is to quit the match.\n-The aiming guide is smaller than the cueball. If you try to barely miss a ball to hit your target ball, you will most likely hit the one you were trying to miss.\n\nThese are the HUGE bugs I have encountered.

Basically give you where the ball will go so all you have to do is a simple line to hole and you'll win. That and it's based on in game money system to were if you loose you can't play anymore unless you spend real life money to play.  Not worth it, hard to find a decent billard/pool game that's free or one to buy they all have the lines showing you where the ball will go rather it be pure luck and best of your aiming instead of a holding hand.","May 14","false","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Thought I'd enjoy this as it looks a lot like Mini Clip Pool the web browser game and 8 Ball the mobile phone game. Unfortunately it's not as polished and not very good. Just play those games if you want a free simple pool game.\n\nThis game takes a while to find an opponent due to hardly anyone being on line I managed 3 games in 40 minutes. I lost one, won one and the other game I left because the shot clock disappeared the game lagged out and before I knew it the other played had potted 3 balls whilst I was still lining up my shot. It then got stuck on my previous shot and nothing was happening. I'm on 72mb fibre with 5-10 ping on other games, pretty bad from a game that's basically browser based.\n\nThere's not really any skill involved this game unlike other pool games. The game I won I just lined up every shot and hit at full power. There isn't really any need for back spin, side spin or anything else as the physics and balls don't work that well. I know it's only overhead 2D pool but there's other pool games out there with semi or better realism. You should at least have consequence for smashing every shot without thought but I never potted the white or a wrong ball. Maybe I'll try this again after they patch it a few times but not that bothered to be honest. This could have been a cool time breaker for those odd 10-15 minutes spells when I'm patching or installing but it's terrible.","March 15","true","0.4"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"

While I don't think it's that groundbreaking of a game, it doesn't stop you from playing after a while, forcing you to pay to continue, which I can appreciate.  You CAN buy things in game with real money if you're impatient, but you can also EARN coins in game to do the same.\n\nWhat else i there to say other than the classic game of pool has never been better.  Sadly, I do have to dock it because it is still a microtransaction game, but the things you can buy are purely cosmetic and don't change the overall feel.  THAT IS HOW IT SHOULD BE DONE!\n\nDo I recommend it though?  Well, if you like a simple game that you can pick up and play without having to learn a whole textbook of rules, then you really can't get much simpler and classic than pool.  So yes, I do recommend this one for any pool enthusiast or casual gamer.  I'd even recommend it to the hardcore gamers who may need a break from their edgy games.","April 4","true","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/typesomething/recommended/434110/","typesomething","Alpha","http://steamcommunity.com/id/typesomething/","6 products in account","Update:\n\n1.The new control option does not make a difference to me at all.\n\nThe problem is that you still have to hold down the left mouse button and that makes it harder to aim.\n\n2. The "white ball" ( in right upper corner ) change where you do not have to click on it to activate it first is nice but still it is not intuitive to use and has some problems when it comes to physics that one person provided feedback about. Not sure if he was correct.\nlink to that thread: http://steamcommunity.com/app/434110/discussions/0/365163686052445050/\n\n\n3. Chat is still useless. It is like it is not there at all.\n\n4. This new ranking also means nothing to me. I wanted to see rank mode and not just some number next to your avatar that you increase just by grinding.\n\n5. The glowing of the power bar is irritating. I understand you added it because of new people who did not know how to shoot the ball but a arrow or something that would appear only once when you start playing the game would be better. Or at least an option to turn that effect off.\n\n6. Coins vanishing still happens. So irritating when you grind for enough coins to buy something and then you realize you still cant buy it in the shop.\nNext time you start the game you see you have less coins then before so you still have to grind.\n\nAll in all I had some fun playing this game but pdates just did not imrove the game enough for me to keep on playing it.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOriginal review:\n\n\nWhen the game was released it was a huge mess. The physics, the bugs etc. caused people to give it a lot of negative reviews. But with every update the game is actually becoming better and better.\nI hope once the game is improved even more that those people will give it another try because at the moment it really does seem to deserve it.\n\nPros:\n- rare free to play game that is not pay to win ( at the moment ). There is nothing you can buy that can give you an advantage.\n\n- developers that actually listen to  some feedback and are actually improving the game ( for now ). When I say they listen I do not mean that usual PR ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t talk " we listen, we care" but in reality they do not.So for now that is a big plus. Of course that can always change for the worse but let's hope that does not happen.\n\n- I really like this top down view. I just do not like pool games with 3D view. For some that could be a bad thing.\n\n- game has those pathetic irritating stupid emotes that every developers loves to add now. I point that out because you can buy new emotes for real money BUT they still added an option to turn that ♥♥♥♥ permanently OFF.\nSo respect for that. Even though they are selling emotes for real money that perma mute option is still there.\n\n- the game  is just a simple and fun pass time.\n\n- the game runs great, 300 + fps or you can lock it to 60 or what ever your monitor runs at. That is also great from the gameplay and your eyes. Nice to see a smaller game like this having more options then some bigger ones.\n\n- some people here say how that flash pool game is better. currently some things are better in that game but that game is also pay to win. You can buy cue with better stats for example. In this game you can not buy advantage. Also 60 + fps compared to 30 fps is also a big plus for this game.\nI do prefer controls and sound in that flash game but they plan to add alternative controls to this one and better sound.\n\ncons:\n\n- you get 250 coins. You can then for example play 5 matches with that and if you lose every time you have to wait one hour to play again. those coins can also be used to unlock some stuff for free.\nif you are bad/ new that can be irritating since you have to wait but once you become better at the game it is not a big deal.\n\nYou earn those coins by wining or by spending real money. Then you bet those coins ( minimum is 50 coins ) and if you win you get your plus the opponent coins. So basically you are gambling.\n\n- You have an option to spend 100 $ and it will still not get you the whole game. Plus the game like i sad has gambling so that could be a problem for some people.\n\n- There was no chat at all. They added lobby chat that is really not useful at all.\nSo there is no wy to talk to your opponents.\noptional text and voice chat should be there.\n\nThey use "trolls" as an excuse but with an option to turn chat off no one can complain about that.\n\n- No way to add people as friends so there is really no communication in this game at all. Their answer is how you can add people trough steam but  it is just not such a good option.\n\nAll that adds to the feel like I am playing against bots sometimes and not real people. Some games do use bots masked as real players on order to make machmaking faster and for other reasons also so who knows, maybe some of online opponents are bots.\n\n\n-sound needs improvement but they said they are working on it\n\n- there are some bugs that can be irritating , but they are working on them also\n\n- there is no ranked mode or something like that but they plan to add that\n\n- there is no controller support but they plan to add that also\n\n- physics are not the best but they already improved that and are listening to feedbaack about it.\n\n\nAll in all this game does have potential. It is  a strange thing to see a free to play game that is not pay to win at the moment and a game where developers ( for now ) are actually listening to the feedback and are improving the game based on that.\n\nI just hope the game does not become worse with time like most free to play games do.","March 23","false","52.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Most of the time, it fails to connect you to a new game or else it drops either you or your opponent's connection and usually never recovers. Oh, and if the connection DOES drop and you leave the match because you've been waiting for 5 full minutes to see if it'll pick the connection back up, you lose the match and the in-game money that you paid to start the match. It's great, especially because losing the connection in the game is seemingly completely unrelated to whether or not you have a good connection to the Internet in real life. Also, can someone tell me what the point of the player ranking is? Yeah, you level up. OK. Does that mean that you get matched to play with players close to your level? Nope. Does it mean that you get rewards for reaching certain levels? Nope. It's just there.","April 4","false","7.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You have to wait an hour to receive your 250 gold player tokens, which I'm glad it's not 24 hours or something, but still.\n2.) I have still yet to understand, without looking online, how to win the rubys without purchasing them with real monies.\n3.) ***WHEN THE GAME LAGS OUT, one can lose their turn, lose the game, and I have also experienced (one occurance) times when I would win on my last 50 gold player tokens and then the game tells me to restart and I do then I'm at zero gold player tokens somehow and have to wait an hour or purchase more.\n4.) One cannot give gold player tokens to friends. I think that should be expanded for the pure aspect of sharing, lol.\n5.) ***MAJOR BOTHER of mine is that we cannot chose to play by real pool rules. I may be part of the few, but I don't like playing slop.\n\nOTHERWISE, I think it's a pretty straight forward pool game and I have put quite a few hours of enjoyment and frustration into it!
