A better tutorial would be nice as well or adding a option for a better dialog would be nice as well.  Date of Post 17/1/16 atmo i would rate 3/10 Potential there but game breaking issues need fixing","January 17","false","0.5"," 14 of 24 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","14","24","0","5"

It's hard to understand what is happening during these combat scenerios.\n- The User Interface is overly cluttered and small, making it hard to understand the information that is shown\n- While I understand that you are supposed to find chests to get better gear, and loot enemies...you often die in the most obscure of ways that often don't really give you a good understanding of what happened or how to prevent it.\n\nI may come back to this game in a few months but at the moment I just could not find much to like about this game.","February 14","false","0.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I do see somewhat the direction it's taking, and I think it can be fun... maybe not something to compete with say Dungeons of Dredmor, but fun.\n\nLet me get some complaints out that hopefully the dev will respond to eventually.\nCurrently the only items you can carry are what you equip (that includes 4 "powers"), and 8 shortcut slots.  I'm really hoping they either add an inventory box, or at least make it so you can find backpacks or bags in the dungeon that either get equipped, or take up a space in the shortcut menu (which if it's in the shortcut, the key for the shortcut could be used for opening the bag)\n\nAnother complaint is that the first floor is HUGE... almost the entirety of my time is just exploring the first floor, and so far I'm still only in my second life.  I feel I have yet to even explore half of the first floor of the dungeon.  I can't say if this should be telling me that the deeper dungeons are going to be so unimaginably large you will never finish exploring dungeons in this game, or if the dev just simply hasn't shrunk the first several floors, making them the same size as end-game dungeons.","March 30","true","3.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rocketsurgery/recommended/383020/","rocketsurgery","rocketsurgeon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rocketsurgery/","3787 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nA pretty shoddy roguelike with very little to recommend it. There are plenty of good games in the genre out there, so there is no reason to waste time and money on this one.\n\nAs best as I have been able to determine (see more about the many impediments to actually trying to play the game below), this is a very generic and simplistic "roguelike"/action rpg-style game with some feeble attempts at humor thrown in. The game being in Early Access, you can argue about the game not being finished etc etc, but honestly, there does not appear to be much for the developer to build on in what is being sold here. Sure, he could, theoretically, toss everything out, start over, and perhaps produce a worthwhile game, but there would be little reason to try to salvage anything of the current game. So, on the off chance that this will happen, I'm sure there will be opportunities to buy that game, without having to subject yourself to this abomination.\n\nAs for the technical shape of the game, as mentioned above, I know it's early access, but it is essentially unplayable due to bugs, crashes and plain shoddy programming. I mean, come on - when I changed the resolution, the game itself rescaled it's ugly blocky "retro graphics" to match, but it did not do anything at all about the GUI. Nothing. No, I'm not talking about the failure to re-scaling it so you can actually read the text and similar things, which is bloody annoying, too.\n\nNo, I'm talking about not even moving the elements to fit the new resolution, meaning that the placement of the UI elements that were supposed to be on the right and bottom edges of the screen uses absolute positions, with the result that those elements now appear, i.e., in the middle of the screen.\n\nIn closing, this is a great example of the current sad state of the Steam store, Early Access and the Greenlight system. I hope that people will have enough sense, not to waste their money on "games" like this, and certainly not the $10/â‚¬10 the developer seem to think it is worth....\n","February 4","false","0.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","1"

In my opinion this is not a well balanced game.\n\nTypical inventory management, and a lot of different objects and potions to collect from chests and defeated enemies. In this case, the inventory and statistics are shown on the screen in different areas that you can change of position. You can press F1 to show a contextual help.\n\nMusic is a little bit annoying and sounds are nonexixtent.\n\nThe map is not complex but i miss the little map of the area in the corner of the screen or a big one when you press M key.\n\nThe game has achievements but it has not trading cards. I encourage to developers to add them in next releases.\n\nI don't understand so well why an early acces game that shows this message "Beta 0.74" in the middle of the screen wants that somebody pay ten bucks for it.\n\nSorry but there are alot of games better and cheaper than this to play more than an hour.\n\nPS: Thanks to Shade00","February 20","false","1.1"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
