My men were strong and well equipped, and I've collected a stash of treasures that I could either sell for fame or fortune. I was so sure that we'd be able to plow through the 6th and last expedition with this team until... I arrived at the golden pyramid only to find I lacked a key to enter it...\nI panicked, but hey, this was my best team. We would just drop by at the tomb in the distance and we'd come back to the pyramid and go home in one piece.\n\nHaving planned the journey so that we would arrive at the golden pyramid with minimum supplies, (so that we could stack up on treasures) we were in no way prepared to tackle another journey. Still, we made it to the tomb and retrieved the key without much trouble. It was during the return trip that hell broke out.\n\nHaving reached zero sanity a long time ago, it was the cultist, the newest member of our group, that faded into the darkness of the night first. Fine. I was prepared for something like this. A few days later, my best man, the British soldier, murdered the sailor, mumbling something about a conspiracy... Also fine. I never really liked that alchoholic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. I bet he really was conspiring to kill us all. But a several more days in, my best man also murdered my second best man, the scout! This time, he didn't even bother making any excuses, partially because he was busy feeding on the murdered scout. God, my best friend had turned into a cannibal right before my eyes... I bet the cultist ran away because he knew about the soldier's peculiar habits... I should have realized he was a complete nut right from the start when he talked to me about all that "Gaining sanity from fighting" nonsense!! Fearing my own safety, I ran for my life, leaving the soldier behind. I half expected to be chased down and murdered like the others, but somehow, I made it back to the pyramid in one piece, with nothing but the key and a few hyena pelts. Oh, I was so relieved I was finally able to return to British soil...\n\nI was alone, poor, traumatized, and I've sworn many many times that I would not ever set foot on foreign soil again, but mysteriously, I found myself heading back to the explorers club.

THIS. GAME. NOW.\n\nThis game is hilarious, beautifully-crafted, and addictive. It's wonderful in its simplicity, infinitely replayable, and every patch improves the game significantly. I've been playing for nearly a year now, and have no intention of stopping -- what is more, playing a single game has successfully turned several of my friends into committed players too. Heck, it'd be an excellent party game, where a room full of people vote on the decisions the expedition should make. I paid $13.99 for this last year, and I don't regret one cent of that.\n\nA special note of thanks should be made towards the Germans who've made this. The makers of the game are so dedicated to their craft and to their customers that when I bought it last year in its earliest Alpha stages, it was better than most triple-A games at release. They are so dedicated that when they released a fun Halloween patch last year that nearly broke the game, they immediately released a patch to fix every single problem. They are so dedicated that, even though they added some truly odd characters (Harriet Tubman? Marcus Garvey I get, but...Harriet Tubman?!), they actually make all the characters WORK in the context of the game: Nikola Tesla has a death ray! Sir Richard Francis Burton can speak to all natives! Charles Darwin gains Sanity by collecting butterflies! They are so dedicated that when they added H.P. Lovecraft to the game, they programmed him with a secret, unique code that will only make sense to people familiar with his personal life. They are so dedicated that I keep forgetting that this game is STILL in Alpha! They could easily release it now without changing a thing! But they care so much, they are keeping it in Alpha until it fits their exacting standards.","January 21","true","178.9"," 28 of 30 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","28","30","0","0"

I HAVE PLAYED THIS GAME MUCH LONGER THAN THE STEAM PLAYTIME.\n\nLike another reviewer said, this is like a cross between FTL and Jules Verne. Lead a famous explorer (and his/her hired help) through strange new lands to meet (and potentially anger) the natives, battle wild animals and find enough treasure to gain the fame you need to become the greatest explorer the world has ever known.\n\nThe map is procedurally so you're going to have a new adventure every time, and the pixel artwork is really charming. In order to survive all six expeditions, you need to make sure you have all the right tools (rope, torches, food, etc) for the job, but you also need room in your inventory to fit all the fabulous treasure you've discovered. It's a fine balancing act between survival and fame/fortune.\n\nLike all rogue-likes, lots of very bad things can happen to you. Shrines that hold the treasures could contain some nasty booby traps, like ever-widening chasms, or the great ball of nothingness, so do you risk getting that sold gold llama statue and thus potentially incur the wrath of the natives/deity/whatever? You won't know what will happen until you take it! Take care of your sanity meter and don't let it get to zero, or bad stuff will definitely happen to you. Crewmembers may fight, turn cannibal or wander off into the dark, never to be seen again.\n\nI've been playing this game since Alpha 10 and even in Alpha status this game is 100% playable and nothing feels 'missing.' The devs have put out numerous additions and bugs every few weeks and this is one of the best rogue-likes I've ever played. It's a very unique spin on the genre, taking place in the 19th century as opposed to generic dungeons and space travels. You're going to feel like you're Indy as you play, except there's no Nazis. Have you got what it takes to become the greatest explorer?","May 19, 2015","true","13.0"," 36 of 45 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","36","45","2","0"

Such a beautiful landscape lay before me that I should never see its like. A missionary by the name of Derrick Fry joined us, along with Derrick Richard--a grizzled old tar, and Chalipa Sorabji--a curious Persian lass with a knack for foreign tongues. I'm sure we shall all get along splendidly on this magical voyage.\n\nDay 3: Only 3 days in and we came across an elephant graveyard. After loading up on some guilt-free ivory, we headed out. Chalipa was rather put out by this, however, and babbled on about evil spirts. Silly superstitions do not scare me, however. This is the modern world, after all!\n\nDay 7: Such luck! Underneath an unsightly stone we found a drum and some cocoa leaves, which I shall savour later. Chalipa screamed and pointed at the stone, claiming it was the head of a long-dead heathen god. Bah! Richard asked if he could have the drum, but I wouldn't have him damaging this priceless relic, and had Chalipa carry it instead, despite her protests.\n\nDay 18: We came across the village the Missionary was after. A curious New Guinean tribe of warriors. I was halfway through recording a study on their culture when an older fellow asked to play me a traditional tribal rythmn on the drums. Thinking this invaluable to my studies, I agreed, whereapon he bashed Chalipa in the face with it and began babbling some heathen curse. Chalipa cried herself to sleep as the rest of us slept soundly. We awoke to the happy sound of children's laughter, with them pointing at us--no doubt as some sort of tribal gesture of friendliness. We left as they waved their spears and shook their fists in some primitive sort of goodbye gesture. Such pleasant folk. I hope we see them again.\n\nDay 26: After resting at a leisurely hot spring, a tiger, painted in white swirls for some reason, attacked us. It was a hard fight, but interestingly, the tiger only seemed interested in attacking Chalipa. We quickly dispatched it, but Chalipa was left with a nasty wound, and we have no medicine with which to treat it. She mumbled about the curse as she passed out.\n\nDay 34: We came across the shrine the chieftan from the previous tribe had told us about, inside which we found a beautiful golden vase. As I picked it up, Chalipa woke long enough to scream some nonsense about the wrath of the gods, but her babble was drowned out by the sudden volcano forming beneath us. My word, New Guinea is such an active place! We bid a hasty, but dignified retreat from the shrine, stopping only long enough to have tea.\n\nDay 41: Times have gotten hard for us. We have run out of both tea and whiskey, and Chalipa simply will not shut up about these ghosts of hers. As if to accentuate the ridiculousness of her claims, a funny little tribesman clutching his chest crawled toward our camp in the middle of the night, his wound looking far worse than hers. "Why, that's no ghost, it's just a silly man." He motioned toward us, and toward his chest. I assured us we loved his people too, and his face screwed up in agony, presumably over the knowledge he could not come with us. He shook his head and repeated the motion, pointing towards our surgical kit, and back to his chest, which appeared to be decorated in blood spatter patterns--a tribal custom I'm sure. "Yes, I know, we love modern medicine too." He then went to sleep right there on the ground. It's amazing how comfortable these people are within their native land! Chalipa began screaming about death again, for some reason. This would prove to be a long night.\n\nDay 52: After backtracking through no small amount of volcanic ash, we finally found the fabled Golden Pyramid! It was a lovely site, and scores of natives poured forth from what was left of the jungles, shouting and waving their spears--no doubt in celebration of our accomplishment. I did not get much chance to study the pyramid, however, nor even to thank our generous hosts, as Richards quite literally scooped me up in his excitement, and made for the boat home. I admonished him on the way back to London, but I gave him a bit of a break after a sudden swell threw Chalipa off the boat and he narrowly rescued her from a school of sharks that had been following us since we left.\n\nWeeks Later: Back home safe in London, my fellow adventurers and I had a jolly good laugh about our adventures back home before the awards ceremony. Afterward, I was keen to get on safari again, and so I gathered up my trusty sailor and translator to settle the logistics. Chalipas face went pale with wonder and she screamed with what I can only assume was excitement all the way back to our next destination. What a fun time this will be!","May 30, 2015","true","28.9"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 29 people found this review funny","90","26","29","29","2"

The atmosphere brilliantly captures a sense of exploration, and the fear sets in when sanity gets low too. The graphics are smart and suit the game well. The music is genuinely brilliant. The multiple expeditions format nicely breaks things into easy parts. The balancing of fame vs income works as beautifully as the scrap in FTL. So much of this game is already brilliant.\n\nOn the downside, combat is still a little unintuitive, and there may be some balance issues with some of followers - the artist needs a buff to offset all the inventory they take up. Also, some of the events are poorly balanced - right now, exploring caves is completely pointless, because it seems to outright kill max level companions the majority of the time. A bit more variety in the early expeditions would be appreciated too - right now, it's just a case of 100% the first expedition to rush on to something more interesting.\n\nOverall, thoroughly recommended.\n\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cCFroHcUyVM","August 7, 2015","true","10.2"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","0"

That said, there is so much more to be added to the game as well. The Curious Expedition caught my eye while I was looking for a game somewhat similar to Sunless Sea. That is, an adventure game that bases itself primarly on text. What I found was a great mixture of that and old school RPGs.\n\nThe game itself is played by selecting a character (based on historical figures) whom has his/her own traits, followers, and starter gear. This selection ultimately determines your playstyle. You will visit various locations while competing with several other adventurers to bring back the most impressive artifacts and native items. There is also a kind of bonus you can complete if agreed upon before leaving.\nEx. 1. A priest asks if you would help him spread the word of God in a certain village.\n2. A commander asks you to bring back a soldier who is AWOL.\n\nThere are are also many interesting mechanics such as a 'Sanity' Bar which determines your movement across the hex-like board of the land. There are deserts, jungles, mountains, and other terrains to trek across, each with their own dangers and rewards depending on what region you're exploring. When on an expedition, the further into the map you go, the more will be revealed.\n\nThings will can very interesting, very fast once you choose to steal that idol the Natives worship. Sometimes natural or...un-natural disasters can occur sending you scrambling across the board in panic. Your adventure ends when you find the Golden Pyramid in each area you visit. However, you may stay as long as possible if you wish to collect more artifacts and such. These can be sold or donated to the musuem for fame at the end of each expedition.\n\nVerdict: - 7.5/10 EARLY ACCESS RATING\nThe Curious Expedition is very impressive, especially for an Early Access game. It is fair to say that whatever content is put into this game when its full release occurs will only make the game that much better. Any fans of Adventure games or even RPG fans will find that this is actually a very nice change from the norm. There are many choices and consequences that will affect your story, ranging from minor to catastrophic. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who loved Sunless Sea (although this game is not as dark) or anyone that is seeking an adventure game that is focused mainly on text. The music in the game is also pretty cool.","August 13, 2015","true","12.4"," 20 of 22 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","20","22","0","1"

They wander through although they don´t have any torches left.\nAnd when they come out Tintin is gone and replaced by a horrible disfigured monster dressed in Tintins rags that follows the trek now.\n\nLater they make a camp and the Captain returns.

You play as an explorer from a romanticised nineteenth century, choosing from about a dozen historical names with different special abilities.\n\nYou start with a random kit of companions and or donkeys to make a party and set off on an expedition to gain fame and fortune.  You must complete six expeditions and beat an arbitrary fame score of AI rivals who you don't interact with.  Each expedition creates a random map which gets larger and more dangerous with each successful expedition.  There are villages and shrines to discover, wild beasts to dodge or slay and wonders both natural and supernatural.  Of course, all abstracted into some tidy icons and statuses.  Combat is a simple and fun turn based system of dice rolling and re-rolling to create combos a la Yahtzee.  The goal of each expedition is to find and enter the gold pyramid somewhere on the map, but you'll want to be carrying some loot before you enter as the pyramid magically ends the expedition and sends you back to the Explorer's club in England.  You'll be able to pick a new perk for your explorer from a randomised three choices.  Then you can cash in each piece of loot for either Fame points or Funds to finance the next expedition.\n\nYou'll receive a random quest and be able to shop from a meagre shop whose stores are you guessed it, randomised.

The "simple" goal is to get the most fame after 6 expeditions. The difficulty is neither too easy nor too hard and the satisfaction this game creates is just great. At first I thought this would be like some sort of "Sugar Cane Island" but it's much more than that. I died on the very last expedition, 6 fields before the last golden pyramid - I love this game.

Although I repeatedly came to 6/6 I never got till the end =( anyway! And remember it's Early Access!\n\nSo far it is a bugfree experience into the Alpha game with a skinny, but raw experience. There's plenty of RNG and roguelikeness in this game. Although it could use more features, with the 10 hours I've spent so far I've yet to become truly bored of it with many events, predators and so forth haunting my poor expedition that just wants to find and chart the Golden Pyramid.\n\nIn the game itself, there is plenty to discover and try to keep yourself sane. By consuming mangoes, cocoa leaves, drink some whiskey etc. If you have a cook, you can cook raw meat you get from trading or hunting animals as well.\n\nI was also pleasantly surprised that the loot I found during my expedition could be brought back or traded during the expedition for helpful items. Upon bringing them back however, you can trade them for fame to win against your competitor intrepid adventurers or if you feel confident enough or need the cash, turn them in the auctioneer for a fixed cash transaction. Maybe there should be a feature here too in the future that you could really 'auction' them and see if the NPC can bid on them for a higher/lower price? Definitely can use more features.\n\nI found that you could only have 5 party members however, and that a pack animal counts towards the number limit. And you can only have so many items with you at one time. This can be increased by leveling up your party members up to level 4. Although you cannot level up your animal nor can you level up the leader. Which I frown upon. There is an animal pack character though which upon leveling up increases the amount your pack animals can drag along. However, consider very carefully as that means one less effective combat unit which can be very deadly.\n\nUnless you can keep running. Which you probably can't. Once you aggro any wild animal (red, not blue) they will try to follow you until they catch up to you, in which you will need to fight them off or flee. Fleeing has potential consequences however so choose wisely.\n\nPositive features:\n+ Fairly bugfree, despite this being an Alpha game at the moment of this review!\n+ Active devs on forums as well as Twitter.\n+ Unlockable characters after you achieve some special prerequisites!\n+ Loot. And Gold. Did I mention massive Gold Statues?\n+ Choice between turning them in for additional fame upon return towards Civilization or additional cash for future expeditions.\n+ Can recruit helpful characters during or before travels. Max party size is 5.\n+ Upon ending on successful expedition you can choose one perk to aid in future expeditions.\n\nSome remarks:\n= Some items in your inventory doesn't stack. This is especially true for loot. So that means you have to make a very weighted decision to drop down items that can be very useful towards you instead of loot. I especially found this a huge constraint during my travels.\n= Cannot level up beyond 4. Maybe that is due balancing issues?\n= Gameplay is alright for an Alpha, I do expect more features as well as nice things in the future for this game.\n= The game could be more clear with dice combinations, although I managed to figure out this myself by experimenting... This could be very frustrating for new players towards the game.\n= Would like a bit more information about the location I choose to send an expedition from.\n= Maybe a HUD or extended info panel/stash once you return from an expedition would be nice so you can adequately prepare for the next one or drop some things behind.\n= Improving standings with the local tribes seems near impossible. I've never in all my playthroughs gotten near 20/20 yet. Highest was however 15/20 which I managed to unlock the last and in my opinion, hardest character with.\n\nNegative aspects:\n- Cannot upgrade pack animals, pets or leader. Unsure if intended feature or not.\n- Seems there is no way to stop bleeding once it happens without a medi kit. Reminds me of TF2 when I bleed to death =(\n- When you trigger certain events, it will become impossible to get near the Golden Pyramid, thereby with no ending button the only thing you can do is restart the game and start a new expedition.\n- There is no way to pass time whilst stuck on one spot. (Dev commented on forum that a fix is pending)\n- No additional info from the main expeditioneer's sidekicks when you start a new expedition. You don't know what their character info is therefore you have to jot it down somewhere if you want to make a weighted decision on which party to pick before you forget the info again for a new expedition.\n\nConclusion: If you value one €1 for every hour played, then this game is definitely worth it during their Alpha Access with plenty of potential and growth space. However there will be probably a long time to go before this game is finished, but this game is quite interesting and there was no moment when I got bored with the events in game and my desire to snatch every single golden statue!\n\nIf you want to watch my stream, I have a thread below:\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/app/358130/discussions/0/620713633865863482/ or here is my link: Twitch.Tv/TheMeadowz","May 20, 2015","true","26.7"," 23 of 31 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","23","31","0","0"

There's a reason why I've racked up nearly 200 hours on it already.\n\nThe devs, as near as I can tell, are great, and are active in the forums, both in terms of addressing reported bugs and in terms of participating in discussions regarding game balance and so forth, and incorporating the fruits of those discussions into future updates.  The one time I encountered a game-breaking bug, and reported it, it was hotfixed within 48 hours, which is incredible to me.  These folks are great.\n\nThe updates seem to come like clockwork every few weeks, too, which is awesome, because there are always new features and balance tweaks happening.  Really, this game could have been considered done when I bought it (in Alpha 11 or 12, I think), but they keep adding more cool stuff to it.  Dinosaurs, the Hall of Fame, being able to have your loot carried by a giant tortoise named Ms. Perkins.  What is not to love here?  I mean, come on.\n\nIf you enjoy Roguelikes, and are inclined to be darkly amused by Victorian exploration narratives, buy this game.  If you just like Roguelikes, buy this game.  Screw it, just buy this game.  Only $15 (US), and it keeps getting better every couple of weeks, and it's already really great now, while it's still in Alpha.\n\n","September 9, 2015","true","244.2"," 15 of 17 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","15","17","0","1"

Currently (Though this could certainly change) it's far easier to get a winning score with a ♥♥♥♥ and pillage strategy where you build your team around combat and loot wildlife/natives of their treasures. While that's historically correct, it would be nice in terms of gameplay if peaceful paths were a bit more viable.\n\nAlso wouldn't hurt to have more general content (The gameplay is primarily in provisioning your expedition and using your resources wisely, after a couple games you'll have seen the majority of the encounters) but, again, even as-is it's entertaining.","April 3","true","10.5"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","15","18","0","1"

It is everything you think it is from the trailer. The game revolves around choosing an explorer (actual famous historical figures) and discovering uncharted lands. The style of the game is fantastic, the difficulty isn't set so hard that you just never want to play (I Wanna Be The Guy) but does ramp up enough near the end to present a big challenge. The score is short, which is my only complaint, so you hear repeats of music a lot, but the music you do hear is very well done and helps set the overwhelmingly ominous tone. I really do wish they had more music.\n\nMy favorite part of the game is all the little things you discover throughout each playthrough. It seems the same everytime but with different characters, who only provide some inherent bonus, until you really start to pay attention. I just recently noticed all the dialogue in the game is written in the style of the person you are playing as, and after googling (every) explorers and learning about them this was a very, very nice touch that added more personality and life to the game. I also appreciated that the game did have a smattering of education, in that some of these historical figures I had never heard of.\n\nHighly recommend, worth every penny.","November 6, 2015","true","10.5"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

But as much as that sounds horrible and generic and flavor of the month, it's not at all.\n\nThere is a quote on the store page from a Rock Paper Shotgun article, that the game already has a lot to offer the player, even as an Early Access title. That's true, but that quote is from 2014 and currently two years and roughly 27 content updates ago.\n\nCurious Expedition's first great success is that it's actually an *exploration* game. So many games featuring exploring are all about clicking nodes or collecting some sort of points or resources or whatever. Curious Expedition pushes you to explore, punishes you for exploring poorly and rewards you for exploring well. You also will want to gather supplies and loot as you go, of course, but you can beat a map without food or loot, but not without exploring. Using sight lines, clearings in the forest or gazing across a lake all quickly become habitual.\n\nCurious Expedition's second great success is it's use of the setting. The Age of Exploration is fairly seldom seen in games, and the use of real people for the character names gives a fantastic effect similar to the Civ games: "how is Harriet Tubman still ahead of me I hate her!!" or whatever the case may be, it's more memorable and engaging than the alternative. But the setting also extends to the way race relations work in the game, or the various side effects of consumables or the way male and female characters may be received. None of it is done with a heavy hand and if anything many fine touches may be easy for some gamers to miss, but they're there and they're fantastic.\n\nThe music is fantastic, and changes dynamically based on how your expedition is faring. The pixel art is very well done and while some of the early placeholder art was very ugly, the final versions of things have all been fantastic. The character models are very simple but when you see yourself riding a raptor, it won't matter too much.\n\nBUGS: There are a few, but the devs are very active on the Steam forums and will be happy to see your screenshots. I have never had a single crash type error ever, only things like typos or quest glitches.\n\nPRICE: It's not going under $11 until after it has been fully finished and released, which is not going to be super soon. You get a lot of great game for the price so either grab it the next time it's marked down or just give them three extra bucks.","April 28","true","62.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

You'll meet natives, ransack shrines, explore caves, fight wild beasts, loot cool items, level up your party members, and occasionally eat those party members to survive.\n\nIf you're unable to see past the 16-bit style graphics to enjoy the epic adventurous narrative the games brilliant design allows you to create for yourself, TCE is probably not the game for you. But if you're a gamer's gamer, more concerned with making meaningful choices that could very well result in very tragic consequences, you'll find TCE refreshingly challenging.\n\nDo you waste an inventory slot/funds on dynamite you may never use but will wish you had if you get trapped inside mountains?\n\nDo you drink whiskey when getting low on sanity, even though your Scottish soldier is already and alcoholic and could only get worse?\n\nDo you ransack the ancient altar to find loot, when you know it will upset your native animal handler who is giving your mounts a huge carrying bonus?\n\nDo you explore that cave even though the cultist in your party has developed claustraphobia?\n\nDo you rest overnight at that native village when your British soldier is an unapologeteic racist?\n\nThe answers to all of these questions are almost always yes.

On the way you loot and collect treasure, fight wild animals, natives or monsters and haggle with traders, natives or monsters... I mean slave traders. Between the expeditions treasure can be given to the museum for fame or sold to gain money for buying equipment for your next expedition.\nAn overview:\n+ great atmosphere (you just have to love that nice retro pixel graphics)\n+ dice roll combat system that is very fun with lots of dice combinations\n+ surprising and fun events (transforming a jungle into a desert by accident or witnessing how one of your expedition members suddenly transforms into... something else)\n+ recruit, dismiss and level your expedition members\n+ management of items vs treasure, what to keep, what to toss?\n+ great replay value because of many characters to choose from and random expeditions\n+ great for playing in between, early expeditions take 5 to 10 minutes, later ones up to 30 minutes\n\nStill in alpha, so the following issues will hopefully be addressed or fixed:\n- many events are often very similar. A bit more diversity of hints and events would be nice\n- very many texts and sometimes you click too fast and can't go back\n- no chance to let time go on without moving (when trapped by rising water on one tile you can't do anything because time does not go on)\n- you can only save between expeditions\n- you can't sell or discard mundane items between missions\n- too few combat combo opitions for the blue face dice\n- sometimes the balance and difficulty in later missions is very frustrating (but developers promised to focus on this in the next patch)\n- no record of your previous successes (or to be more accurate: failures)\n- not much content when finishing the game (I believe a statue was mentioned?)\n\nI have tons of fun playing this game and after 11 tries and 15 hours playtime I even managed to finish my sixth expedition, coming first, which was not so difficult, but surviving that's the hard part ^^'","June 5, 2015","true","46.1"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","6","6","2","0"

It's got great replay value, and each update has brought more and more things to explore.\n\nI am a particular fan of the writings of H.P. Lovecraft, and the game evokes a strong lovecraftian sense of horror, brought out even further by the text being presented in the style of a first person journal.\n\nThe theme of the game really draws you in and, from reading interviews, I saw that it was influenced by Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, which I decided to pick up. It has a lot of powerful imagery, particularly in conjuring the sense of being utterly alone in the jungle, with just a thin barrier of trees between you and the incomprehensibly vast wilderness. That detachment from civilisation comes through incredibly well in The Curious Expedition, especially in the descriptions of the campsite at night - the alien sounds, the foreign smells, the endless darkness - it all serves to immerse you in that unfamiliar world.\n\nI highly recommend this game to all who will listen, and I look forward to discovering all the secrets in the updates to come.","February 21","true","148.9"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","1"

It's way too random, events are almost always negative and the game doesn't really explain itself well at all. There is a tutorial, but it only explains the most pointless things, things you will figure out for yourself in the first few minutes of the game. There are many more important things it could explain, but it's just a waste of time.\n\nCombat is a great example. You need to combine dice, that the game doesn't even explain go together. The only sign is that dice shake when they can be combined. It would be great if there was just a list of things you might be able to do if you had the right dice. Would make taking chances with rolls feel a little less pointless.\n\nThe way the game progresses the competition is also ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It feels like arbitrary advances with AI explorers just shooting up points with no explanation. It feels cheap, and it probably is. Why not have the game showcase the AI achievements, what they brought back, what they get for it? Might actually learn something through playing the game eh?\n\nTalking about random bs the game also likes to apply arbitrary restrictions to proceeding. That stone in the "Shadow" shrine you saw? Yeah, gonna need that to unlock the pyramid- like finding the pyramid wasn't even important, no you gotta unlock the stock lock that no mortal could possibly even open. Oh, going back for the stone? Well how how about getting a game ruining party member abomination to join you and never leave because we made it so that it can't die in battle no matter how many tigers you fight and oh if you think about killing it it will become far more powerful then it ever was in your party? Yup, roguelikes aren't about choosing the best alternative, they are just childish godwin simulators because we all love that.\n\nI also wish the game had some level of ingenuity, or more options in events more alternatives, more use of perks and special abilities, but it all boils down to "do you want to loot or fight this?" The results of which are always bad, but sometimes less awful things happen. Oh and this waterfall is good for sleeping, but this one is only good for going into with a torch, makes sense. It's also kind of rediculous that you party up with the same people, and only ever one person might join you, probably a useless cultist. Also why can't your character level up? Why is he so useless- well okay he doesn't develop unhealthy addictions, psychosis or flat out become a cannibal because we were walking in a forest and he didn't want a chocolate bat, mango, or freaking ask the cook to fry up a tiger steak to eat- nope he wanted the cook for dinner.\n\nOverall, could be really cool. A lot more tweaking with the random map generation, a little more in the way of interactivity and this could be a fun game to spend hours in. Right now it's an okay alternative to wasting time, just to see how random a game can be.","May 31, 2015","false","7.8"," 26 of 44 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","26","44","0","1"

She accompanied me from the very beginning. Why? I have no clue. But I let her stay. On my second mission, I came across an unknown fluid in a temple. I didn't like my nun very much since she was sexist, a nun, and pretty useless for the most part, so I told her to drink it. She didn't hesitate and gulped it down. Her hands then transformed into claws - and although she probably didn't like it, it was the best thing that could have happened to me. With her beast claws she tore apart panthers, gorillas and even a tiger for me. She was a walking menace, following my orders. She also became an acloholic because of all the whiskey I forced her to drink in my effort to keep her sane. By the end of the fifth mission she was the most important member of my team, next to the water buffalo. On my last mission I went into a cave without a torch. It was pitch black. Suddenly the nun was gone and in her place was an abomination. Did she transform? Was she eaten? We weren't sure. The abomination was still cool since it also followed us around and was a good fighter, too. But one night, it started eating my soldier and I had to put it down. We had to go home without the nun. She almost made it to the end. We only got as far as we did because of her. This is for the nun whom I disrespected, whose name I've already forgotten, but whose claws I'll never forget. You rocked.\n\nOkay, storytime's over. This game is a historically almost accurate representation of the British Museum's history. It's the 1800's, archeology and exploration are en vogue. You are a famous person of your choice, you travel to a wild, unexplored part of the planet of your choice and then proceed to rob the people there of as much cultural property as you can - and hope you'll get away with it. Steal from temples, kill wildlife, trade with villagers and/or slavers, catch butterflies; all that and more for fame, money and the British Museum.\nThe maps and events are randomly generated to guarantee a high replay value. You can manage your party and your inventory, both with solid mechanics and lots of choices. The battles are dice-based and strike a very nice balance between strategy and luck. Even though the game is still in early access, it feels pretty finished for the most part and the devs have delivered a good amount of updates over the last couple of months.\n\nVerdict: A good game, definitely worth a try.","April 22","true","7.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","7","8","3","0"

You choose to be one out of a number of  19th century "celebrities" leading exploration parties to the unknown corners of the world filled with ancient temples, dangerous creatures and native tribes. All the action is turn-based and your ultimate goal is to finish all 6 expeditions alive and gather the most fame.

A really unique concept and lovingly executed by a very small and dedicated dev team. Even at this stage of development it is very playable with a lot of interesting and different mechanics. It is very heavy on storytelling, and each expedition tells a new tale. The graphics and animations are also very cute. And the devs are very friendly and active in the community, very communicative about their plans, and frequently implement ideas and comments from community discussions - and I've only been following this a couple of weeks. To boot, the game has a darkly humourous streak, while at the same time managing to make incisive commentary on the very negative effects that colonial exploration and expansion had on the rest of the world.\n\nTo avoid potential disappointment I should just comment on the Early Access status of the game. Mechanically and structurally there is a whole lot of stuff in there but currently the content isn't anything like as fleshed out within that as it will eventually be. The Early Access period is being extended somewhat indefinitely so long as they can afford to keep adding comment, and the devs have indicated they want to carry on until around the end of the year. So given they are currently releasing pretty feature-packed updates every couple of weeks, there is an absolute ton of stuff still to come.\n\nFinally - Charles Darwin riding a velociraptor, legging it from a tear in the fabric of space-time consuming the entire map, of course not forgetting to continue gathering rare butterflies with his butterfly net on the way.

This is pretty much a new take on games like Oregon Trail. The whole purpose is to scour randomly generated maps of various climates and conditions while searching for a Golden Pyramid! You will find sometimes welcoming natives who, if they like you, can be the difference between life and having your leg chewed off by a hungry companion yet also angry aggressive cannibals, if they don't like you. You'll find tombs and tomes of great worth that can be sold for money to fund further expeditions or gifted to museums for untold fame. Did I mention you're competing against other expedtions? That's right, it's all about the fame here and if you want to be the most famous explorer, you're going to have to ♥♥♥♥ off a few natives by stealing their birthrights while also capturing magnitudes of butterflies. Careful you don't ♥♥♥♥ off the wrong God though or you'll end up in the bottom of a bit or melting in a volcano. I think my favorite part of the game, which some would argue against, is the fact that the encounters are wholly random and unpredictable.

They don't even explain how the (very unintuitive) combat works, and what they do explain isn't explained well.  I completed an entire playthrough of six expeditions, but I still don't understand how characters level up. I know it has something to do with exploring new sections of the map, but that's it.\n\n- The game is just BRUTAL for newbies because the player isn't shown basic information. The game doesn't warn you that your explorer can only have four other helper characters before you recruit a fifth, forcing you to dismiss one (angering the others). In combat, each heart stupidly represents TWO health. Countless other examples.\n\n- Competing against other explorers to steal the most treasure from natives around the world is a great premise, but it's mostly wasted. After choosing who to play as, you don't interact with the other explorers AT ALL - you don't talk to them (who doesn't want to talk smack to Harriet Tubman?), you never get to explore the same area of the world as them, you don't even compete with them for supplies or helper characters! Harriet Tubman may as well just be TUB - a stranger's high score on an arcade game that you're trying to beat.\n\n- The dice system is a MESS. Characters' dice are ONLY used for combat - exploring caves and stuff is mostly about having a torch or rope to avoid an otherwise guaranteed injury. Non-combat situations where chance is involved seem to be totally random, with the "roll" not shown. The basic premise of combat is that all of your party's dice are rolled, and then you combine the symbols rolled to do damage to enemies, or to block damage that turn. While you can do a little damage with just the symbols from your characters' basic dice, most explorers start with a gun (the game seems to make it almost impossible to get a second gun), and combos that involve a gun are MUCH more powerful. More to the point, because it's so dangerous to let enemies have even a single turn in combat, either you will have to avoid combat entirely (by using up special items to do so) or your choice of party members will be almost totally dictated by choosing people who have the right color dice to use your gun properly to burst down the enemies in a turn or two. This really screws up the theme of the game! If you choose the explorer who starts with the rifle, soldiers are largely useless to you because they have red dice, while the rifle only combos with the symbols from blue dice. Oh, and did I mention that the game doesn't tell you what symbols a gun needs to combo? They leave it up to you to "experiment" - i.e. to get mauled to death by beasts and natives until you look up everything on the wiki. (Every armed explorer seems to start with the wrong characters to combo with his gun... in FTL terms it would be like if the Mantis ship with the 4-man teleporter only started with a crew of an Engi and a Zoltan).\n\n- The game talks about a "weight" limit, but the system is that you have a certain number of inventory slots, each of which can hold a stack of up to 10 of the same item. Yes, old school gamers, that's right - the terrible inventory system from the original Jagged Alliance is back!\n\n- There are TOO many items that are very similar, and the game doesn't handle them properly. Rope and "climbing gear" are separate items (even though the image for climbing gear includes rope) but you have to use ROPE to CLIMB up a shrine, NOT climbing gear). During an expedition where I was looking for musical instruments to bring back to someone in England, a native asked to see my bongo drums, and when I handed them over he tuned them to sound better, increasing their value... but when I got back to England, the stupid buggy quest didn't recognize the improved bongos as a musical instrument.\n\n- Interface problems! You only get to visit the store ONCE after each expedition - click carefully! Haggling doesn't reduce prices... instead haggling appears as an item with negative value in the inventory of whomever you're trading with - that sounds like the worst possible way to implement haggling because IT IS. When you unlock a new explorer, the game doesn't tell you HOW you unlocked him (although you can check the conditions to unlock new explorers by clicking their blank portraits). If you have two animals in your party, you can't directly mount the second one - you have to dismount the original one first. When mousing over items in inventory, their tooltip is shown in the OPPOSITE DIAGONAL CORNER OF THE SCREEN.\n\n- Every successful expedition ends with you following your compass to find a golden pyramid. The compass mechanic is TERRIBLE. It gets more accurate as you discover more areas, meaning you have to watch is sllloowwwwllly swing back and forth at first to get even a rough idea of what direction to head in. The game NEEDS a better way to show you roughly what direction the pyramid is.","December 28, 2015","false","11.9"," 40 of 73 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","40","73","2","4"

In this game you take part as one of historical explorers add discover forgotten secrets of lost lands. Game features fantastic elements like Ancient scrolls that actually work, surviving dinosaurs or huge gorillas that could tear you apart.\n\nGame consists of 6 expedition each can be completed in approximately 15-25 min so overall to finish one run you will need 1.5h to 2.5h. I have been playing a game since alpha 7 and I am totally in love with it. Each new run is different, game is challenging and each expedition in the run is harder than the previous one, scaling nicely and easing new players into the game. I feel that game it’s worth it’s price in the current state already so it is money well spend.\n\nDevelopers are very active on twitter and easily approachable. Curious expedition is updated on fortnightly basis and updates always include new features to keep the game fresh.  I have started new lets play series in which I will feature all 6 expedition of one single run. So you can have a look at the game play.\n\nIn addition to that Devs were kind enough to give me the copy of a game to give away on my channel. In this first video I explain rules to enter the giveaway process.\n\nYou can have a look at it here but I strongly recommend watching it in the playlist on my channel which will make it easier for you to follow remaining episodes.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5K9UYxpXyRY&list=PLCZleGQiTyuAfiMp75TGMmMmen-eMGku8&index=1","May 19, 2015","true","9.2"," 17 of 29 people (59%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","59","17","29","2","0"

At the time of writing this, the game is at Alpha 13 and about 40% done if I had to gauge it myself: the fine details and overall "feel" of the game are already making it very much alive, but its balance is broken to the point where I would not recommend playing it if you're not well-versed in roguelikes and looking for something to seriously break your head into.\n\nBut that's pretty much the only bad thing I have to say about it.\n\nThe Curious Expedition is a boatload of fun, employing a theme that is practically an epitome of the genre, and packing a lot of excitement for players who are willing to take the right risks and perform a very minimal amount of micro-management. Almost every run is story-worthy in its own right, and you don't have to stray too far from this review section to get a sense of how quickly and hilariously ♥♥♥♥ can hit the fan if you're not careful (or just unlucky).\n\nI would recommend this game, at its current stage of development, to fans of the genre who are looking for a very refreshing up-and-comer.","July 11, 2015","true","38.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

This time around, the player takes on the role of a small party of 19th-Century explorers engaged in a gentleman's wager - to travel the world on six concurrent expeditions, competing to see who can gain the most fame. It's a fairly quick and lethal game, but that's exactly what it's meant to be - a good way to kill a few hours at a time, running expedition after expedition off to their doom.\n\nGRAPHICS: Expedition uses a rather charming 8-bit style, which I personally found very appealing. Trying to make sense of things can be a bit daunting at first, especially once the world map is spread out in front of you, but once you have a few games under your belt it becomes easier and easier to glance at a pixelated hex or crude 8-bit figure and know exactly what you're looking at (ie, the "Dwarf Fortress ASCII Effect").\n\nSOUND: The music for Curious Expedition is likewise done in a retro style, and while the number of tracks are currently rather limited (just three or four), they're all sufficiently catchy. The sound effects are rather crude, but again that matches the 8-Bit style of the game. Nothing ground-breaking, but it gets the job done.\n\nGAMEPLAY: Expedition is still in an Alpha state, but the vast majority of the game mechanics are in place. There are already a fairly impressive number of items and treasures to find during your explorations, the combat system is fully functional (though poorly explained), and I only encountered a single minor bug during my first dozen or so campaigns. The basics of the game are fairly straightforward - you explore randomized regions, attempting to find treasures while simultaneously tending to your expeditions needs (most notably staving off insanity). Honestly, what's there is already an almost complete game, though some might argue that in it's current state it isn't worth the full $15 asking price. There are three main sticking points for many players:\n\nFirst, the game lacks any significant documentation. There's a basic tutorial that can teach you about the exploration phase of the game, but it skips over several crucial elements of the game (it completely ignores the combat system, for example). Many of the items and abilities you can acquire in the game are poorly explained, and require the player to use trial and error to discover how they work. Proper documentation will likely be provided once the game is further along in development, though, so this is a minor issue.\n\nSecond, the game is VERY random. This is to be expected for any rogue-like game, but there are some who will argue that The Curious Expedition takes it too far. I will agree that the game can be very unforgiving, and the RNG can certainly work against the player at times, but proper planning still plays just as much a role in the game as luck does. Still, if you hate games that are "too random", then this is a title to skip.\n\nThird, the combat system is... unique, and rather hard to wrap your head around. Akin to oldschool dice games like Dragon Dice, each character in the party (and certain special weapons) provide one or more dice in your combat "dice pool". Each round of combat, you roll the dice and use the resulting sigils (eyes, heads, swords, shields, etc.) to build combos. A single sword sigil, for example, will allow you to make a basic attack (1 damage). A sword plus an eye sigil will allow you to instead make a precise attack (3 damage). A sword plus a shield sigil will allow you to balance offense and defense with a riposte (2 damage, 2 defense). There are a few dozen possible combinations, some which are only possible with specialized equipment in your inventory (firearms, rayguns, melee weapons, etc.). You can reroll your dice twice a turn in hopes of getting better combinations of sigils, but once you run out of combo moves it's time for the enemy to beat on you for a turn - and they're often very deadly, so it's important to balance out your offense and defense carefully. Some people dislike this system, but I found it rather intriguing.\n\nUltimately, The Curious Expedition is a game that I would certainly recommend, with the understanding that it is a quick-play rogue-like with a somewhat hefty reliance on both luck AND skill. Even in it's alpha state I've found it quite entertaining, and while the learning (and difficulty) curve is very steep, I've generally learned from each loss to the point where my last two expedition parties were able to complete the game successfully. The average game session is quick and satisfying, with each expedition taking anywhere from five to twenty minutes (once you know what you're doing), and a complete "campaign" consisting of six expeditions (though you'll often die well before reaching the sixth expedition). A basic save and quit feature allows you to stop playing at any given time, and pick up again later - though there's only one save slot, so you can't have more than one campaign in progress at a time.\n\nGiven that the game is still in development, I fully expect that it will only get better with time, and look forward to seeing what the devs come up with. While details are sparse, current chatter implies that we can expect to see many new items, characters, and encounters added to the game in the coming months.","May 29, 2015","true","67.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Keep an eye on their status though…they could easily turn into raging alcoholic cannibalistic kleptomaniacs, which can put your trek in great danger! Alas, to actually finish an expedition you have to reach the beloved golden pyramid.\n\nhttp://noqr.org/the-curious-expedition-where-curiosity-can-often-kill-the-trek/ for the full review","May 25, 2015","true","20.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

As a roguelike, it's not hard to end up doomed.  It's short enough that it doesn't feel like you wasted a ton of time though.  Each adventure is only 10-20 minutes apice.  Then it's back to London to collect your fame and glory.  It's Early Access though, so some things aren't great.\n\nCombat is terrible.  I'm fine with the dice rolling mechanic, but I've never had a party with more than three attack dice.  That's pretty terrible against a monster with three dice as well as twice as many HP as the whole party.  It's also too easy to get boned on your skill selections after an expedition.

The setting/genre niche The Curious Expedition filled made me initially change my tune, but alas, perhaps I should have been more discerning. My excitement for the setting clouded my judgment.\n\nAs of writing this review, I’ve logged 7-8 hours, and while I enjoy the game, I’ve run across a few bugs and headaches here and there. For about a third or quarter of my games, when the game doesn’t lag, it freezes, and when it doesn’t freeze, it crashes, and occasionally combat will bug where the enemy party or your own will do no damage. New party members can’t be analyzed, forcing the player to remember two dozen die faces and traits or hope for the best with their new compatriots, and certain mechanics, such as a party member fleeing (which often results in the theft of an item), forfeit necessary questing items, rendering maps unwinnable. Combat demands better explanation, I was forced to browse the community hub for a guide I'd call plastic at best. That being said, these, to me, are minor issues, and if the developer is perceptive enough, certain to be remedied in the final launch.\n\nThe above are not enough to net the negative review, however. Rather than the alpha state quirks, it seems woefully implemented game features are to blame. The game has no concept of difficulty scaling, with some initial starter expeditions wiping a party while other 4th or 5th expeditions being a 20 day affair (to give you an idea of the pace, a ‘race type mission’ wants you to complete the expedition in 80 days, psshaw). The character line-up is as lacking as its difficulty in more ways than one, insofar as some characters’ equipment and party members are so lacking as to render them nearly unplayable, while others seem carbon-copies with only a utility or two of difference. Additionally, the character line up, while not entirely mechanically-inhibiting, is, dare I say it, curious? The likes of Nikola Tesla and Ada Lovelace populate the roster of an exploration title that hints at the Vernian, so I’m uncertain if this was a developer’s fetishizing some of their personal idols or a vapid attempt to gain so-called ‘geek cred’.\n\nThe game needs work, and while it remains a good time kill (each game can probably be completed in under an hour), I wouldn’t have paid what I did, despite the sale, had I watched a let’s play first. I’ll be certain to be more careful in the future.

You will lead your companions through vast unknown regions in search of Golden Pyramids. You will find treasure and get beaten for taking it, feed your companions coca leaves only to become fearful of butterflies, and you will encounter natives that won't put up with your racist soldier's remarks.\n\nThe combat is surprisingly addictive (and avoidable if necessary), and it requires both luck (based on dices) and planning ahead. I love how the developers payed attention to smaller details and extras like traits and remarks of your companions.

I will be playing more and eventually be reviewing the title upon it's full realese but here's a preview.\n\nWhen going on an expedition, you'd normally expect the story to start off with hardened adventurers off to explore new lands. You probably don't expect someone like Marie Curie, Harriett Tubman or Nikola Tesla going on these expeditions, but this isn't any expedition; it's an expedition in the game The Curious Expedition. Published and developed by Maschinen-Mensch, The Curious Expedition is a pixel art-styled exploration game with dice rolling combat and RPG elements, and it's now on Steam Early Access. It's an odd little game that can't be recommended to everyone, but for those who enjoy quirky little strategy games, this game is for you.\n\nA curious thing about The Curious Expedition is the fact that there is no real “good guys” or “bad guys” like you'd see in something like, say, Tomb Raider or The Uncharted series. Yes, you do need to beat your competition, but they aren't necessarily bad people, they're just people you're competing against to make the most money. The game is rather amoral, which is a delightful change of pace considering how black and white a game like this could potentially be if given in the hands of the wrong developer. However, The Curious Expedition takes it to a different level and makes your actions affect your party members in different ways, making their general rapport with you, however basic a few lines of dialogue can be, completely different.\n\nFull Preview[www.noobfeed.com]","October 19, 2015","true","5.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

First off I'd like to say it lacks some key features, so don't buy this until full release. That is, if the devs have bothered to add them. Let me tell you...\n\nCharacters:You can pick from 3 people at the start, but don't worry. The others will unlock from very basic things, most of which you'll earn without knowing it. Oh and no stress here, you don't have to beat a a game to unlock anyone. Characters start with different companions, items, and perks. The items can be useful but it's usually just basic things. The companions are arbitrary. You almost always have a translator, or a soldier. No one unique.\n\nPerksOne thing that could make some role-play elements nice, that is utterly useless. Each character starts with a perk, no one is very special since some character share the same perk. After a successful 'leg' of your expedition, you may choose another perk. What these perks do, is what the main issue is. They don't help in any way, the majority of the time. Polyglot, for instance, means you can speak many languages. This is useless, since you can just have a translator instead. One I thought was useful is a perk that lets you go through jungle, taking less morale penalties. Well guess what, it didn't make any difference. Still went through jungle, still went insane after 8 tiles of it. Oh and 8 tiles is 2 seconds of travel, and your 15 minute expedition dead.\n\n"Gameplay"So you read some great experiences people had, and thought you'd have the same. Your'e dead wrong. They sugar coated every event to sound exciting. Essentially your'e paying for a small book, about 20 pages long, saying "flip to page 3 for option A." You know, one of those adventure books. You get very few options, and basically just move around a map, going into any point of interest, looting it, then trying to find the pyramid and leave. All the while you have to watch your sanity and for enemies on the map. If you go insane or get eaten, game over start again. This isn't fun, it's repetitive! Honestly rinse and repeat gameplay is not what I expected!\n\nEndgameCurrently your job, and it does feel like more of a chore than anything, is to gain more fame than the next guy, and at the end of several expeditions you get a statue. Really? No, "the tribes were eventually converted to christianity" or "your loyal companion stayed with you until your dying breath on your bed" or even "you've unlocked 'blank'"? No satisfying and well told stories like fallout or any other single player game does? No rewards? Nothing.\n-Also, in my experience, your'e just fending for your life in the late game, not even able to gather loot to increase fame, therefore you may succeed, and fail at the same time. Difficult, or simply unforgiving? That one is opinion based.\n\nCombatI've seen various combat mechanics involving percent chances before, but this one strikes me as an odd ball. Firstly, the tutorial doesn't even go over it, so you have to read some basic guides a few have made for you. One described it as, "yahtzee rules." You 'roll' and get die, each with abilities. However, these abilities depend on what your character has in the inventory, so a gun is almost always necessary to survive any encounter. 90% Of the time, there is a pair of dice with the gun on it, but you cant attack at all, because you needed some other random dice pair to combine with it, for some reason. I get there are combos, but you can ONLY attack with combos. What kind of combat is that? Also, you have like 5 or 6 dice to roll, praying to get the two needed to attack, whereas the enemy rolls 4, gets one attack 100% of the time (and it's all they need, no combos) and does 4 damage to you and your friends. You've got to be kidding me.\nWhat's missing-For starters the HUD is kind of confusing, and I cant choose to do anything neat on any tile I want.\n-I HAVE to be at a site of interest, and even then I can only do one or two things. For instance, I find a waterfall, I can rest near it. Great. I find a temple that I can go inside. Sure, you can loot it, but no you cannot rest here. Forget the nice roof it puts over your head no sleeping allowed, ma'm.\n-When you start your expedition, you are placed in the middle of an area, the borders of the map made out of mountains so you are stuck. WHAT? How did I get here? Why do I HAVE to find the great golden pyramid to leave? Why can't i go back and restock and try again?! The conquistadors did, they did it tons of times! I should start by a harbor, and its should be a safe-haven for storage, resting, trading, missions, etc. But no such place exists.\n-You have competition, other AI are assigned to places around the world, and you cannot go where they are. So tough luck. Also, I see them going to extremely harsh places, on the very first expedition, and they ALL came back to England safely. HOW? It actually says, for each character, "name has returned home." This would imply that they can die. They don't. Also, they just randomly get tons of fame, for what? They don't show us what they brought back. Nor what supplies they have. After some runs, you have nothing left, but the AI have ZERO problems. Real great competition system (sarcasm).\n\nLastly, I get this game has some quirky themes, like dinosaurs or something. But honestly, no one can truly play for story when you have 2 things to worry about, sanity and finding the pyramid. It's just like sunless sea, another early access title I supported. They had a sanity system too, but they balanced it well.\n\nP.S., if someone actually found a golden pyramid, they'd never have to adventure again. They'd be rich beyond measure. This world has to be one where gold is worthless, and it's only used on display or something in museums. Instead, I have to find several golden pyramids... If you ask me, found one and DONE.","May 24, 2015","false","5.2"," 18 of 37 people (49%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","49","18","37","3","8"

Exploring in a game has never been as fun as it's been in The Curious Expedition.  You never know what you're going to uncover next, whether it be an encounter with some savage wildlife, a new species of butterfly for you to discover, or even a tribe of natives that may or may not be welcoming.  Heck, I've had them seem welcoming at first, only to turn on us as the night went on, with the children mocking us as we woke.  You really never do know what to expect with this game, and that makes it all the better.  The game actually feels you with the senses of wonder and exploration as you play.  And it's not over when the expedition wraps up, either,  I really enjoyed the post expedition segment where I decide if I want to donate my various findings to museums, action them off to private collectors, or to keep it for myself, because you never know just what might come in handy on that next voyage across the globe.  For a game that's only in it's Alpha stage, there's already a plethora of content.  You're going to find yourself constantly surprised by something new each time you play.  I can't wait to see what's still to come!\n\nMany people will tell you to avoid Early Access games, but even at this point, there's enough content crammed into The Curious Expedition to warrant being called a completed game.

A quick 10 or 15 min exploration/semi-survival game with really nice retro graphics.\n\nYou have 6 missions per game. So basically an hour, maybe slightly longer per game. Perma death so if you die you have to start over.\n\nWith the above in mind, on the first few missions you cant even recruit/aquire lizardmen companions or raptor pets. You arent given enough game time to actually use and be able to enjoy anything youve earned or bought. Sometimes your companions just up and die for no reason, or get angry and leave for reasons that make absolutely no sense.\n\nThe game worlds/areas you explore, are kinda nice....unless your actually trying to explore. Mountians and chasims often block your way from your objective.\n\nCombat is merely a random number generator. For me some times my die always worked out, and sometimes they didnt work at all. Enemy dice seem to always hit.\n\nI did several play throughs on this game, and maby Im just a terrible explorer, but I never finished higher that 4th place. The AI explorers you compete against complete their missions extremely fast. And they seem to be rewarded with points on a completely different system than you are.\n\nAlso during your explorations youll find trinkets and artifacts to bring back. You have to choose to either sell them for money, donate them for fame or keep them. Well....you cant keep them because they take up space and are really worthless to trade with villagers, selling them is nice but most items are only worth 10 or 20 so you dont earn much money, and buying items for your next trip is expensive. Donations are worse than selling. reason being is that the AI explorers have so much fame that donating isnt enough to keep up with them.\n\nI know all about the EA arguement but these devs really seem to be finished with the base game. And that is a shame. I like the idea this game has, but its implimentation is more of a hassle then anything. Its hard to enjoy the things you earn in this game when you only have it for 15 mins.\n\nI cant reccomend this game, not for $15. Buy it on sale if you really want to try it. Developers will only look at how many positive reviews they have and then wear a grin all the way to the bank.\n\nThis game is NOT worth $15.

Sure the art style is all but complete (it isn't hard to create pixel art) however the combat and exploration is extremely bare-bones and impossible to decipher. The combat requires dice rolls that contribute to an action but as far as I can see those actions equal nothing. Avoiding said battles are usually not possible as they block the path to the goal and the 'tutorial' only shows you basic movement and inventory use. Also at the end of an expedition the AI is overwhelmingly in front with fame!\n\nI will revisit this review later on.

Balance for starters is entirely out, especially in the early levels.  The random dice combat is nothing short of infuriating, the addition of weapons has not helped it much.  The map generation needs to be worked on because some maps are ridiculous - basically impossible.\nI like the 19th century exploration story line but in terms of storytelling it could be a lot better. There needs to be more diversity of events because after a short amount of play you basically just stop reading them as they are so familiar.  Cap on team members is also too small.  Characters should be able to gain positive traits as well as negative, adversity brings out strengths and weaknesses after all.

Or you can run out of chocolate several days before the pyramid and nothing happens. All a matter of luck.\n\nAnd the later expeditions only rely on luck more, when, in order to enter the golden pyramid and thus end the expedition, you have to find moonstones, and good luck with that, because if you don't happen to find the approximately three places in your region where there might be moonstones, then you are going to die.\n\nIf you are not too upset at having your successes crumble away before you due to events completely beyond your control, then it's not too bad a game. I enjoy it, somewhat, but I would not recommend it to most people.","June 14, 2015","false","13.6"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

This game reminds me of a slot machine.  While it technically requires your input, it is almost entirely luck based.  And like playing the lottery, your chances of winning are extremely slim.  Perhaps the game’s one true quality is that, like a slot machine, it is very addictive.  Every time you lose, you feel the urge to play the game again; hoping this time you’ll have better luck.  And luck is what it’s all about.  There is a dice role behind almost every facet of this game.  Who will you have the opportunity to recruit?  Will you get swallowed up in growing pit as you try to run away?  Will you randomly walk towards the temple, or will it be placed in the most remote region of the map?  The game is not entirely luck, however luck plays an overwhelming role in your success or failure.  There are some choices you can make which are clearly better than others.  For example, an abomination is a great addition to your party.  However, you have to be lucky enough to stumble upon a scroll of abomination before you have the opportunity to make that decision.  If you are lucky enough to recruit a strong party, you might choose to attack animals as a way to make money.\n\nCombat is this game’s one strength.  Like a game of poker, the combat combines strategy with elements of luck.  Unfortunately, strategy does not play a significant role in other aspects of the game.  You can make all the best decisions and still lose over and over again.\n\nIf you want to know what playing Curious Expedition is like, and don’t want to spend any money, try to get a coin to land heads-up twenty times in a row.","June 1, 2015","false","15.4"," 4 of 10 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","4","10","0","0"

It's pretty damn hilarious that this developer is so offended that his game got a bad review, that he feels the need to demonize anyone who wrote a negative review. Can't imagine how much he must be crying when reading all these other negative reviews. The developer also lied directly to his userbase, for absolutely no reason. (won't go into any details but suffice to say...) Pretty sure he is a child. I showed his posts / whine to my friends, and they laughed quite a bit at his expense. Especially that lie, which was almost a parody of himself. Will not be being any future ♥♥♥♥♥♥ games from him or any publisher related to him. Weird guy.\n\nedit: Apparently the developer was so hurt by this review, he created a ton of needless drama on his forum devlog and then asked for the moderator to ban me for asking him "Why or How does making permadeath an option hurt those who do not turn it off?" Didn't realize these indie developers were such big babies. By the way: The developer was never able to answer my question, because he has no answer. He seems to have some cognitive deficit preventing him from doing anything other than crying.\n\nGame is mediocre. I'd give it a 3/5. 1/5 is the minimum, plus 1 point for the theme and 1 point for focusing on exploration instead of violence. Actual gameplay gets very repetitive & stale after only 3-8 hours. The path for non-violence is very unbalanced, making it more of a boring grind & RNG luck based roll than actual player skill, preparation/planning/strategy.\n\nI enjoy permadeath games. As a professional game developer, I think very hard about how it relates to game design and whether or not it benefits my own works. With that said: I am disappointed that some of these talented developers have such massive flaws in their thinking.\n\nHowever, I'm very tired of these idiotic permadeath developers who feel the need to, like a religious fundamentalist, force their irrational playstyle down other's throats. Why not make it merely an option? Why even delete from the HDD when you could simply remove it from the game only? It's even worse when their incompetent programming results in consistent bugs that delete your files or their lazy programming fails to write a solid save system from the start.\n\nGuess what? It's a singleplayer game, and a game where progress is important- ESPECIALLY since it is permadeath. Having bugs that delete your save for no reason or hiding the save file from the user is anti-consumer, anti-player, and pro-idiot-developer.\n\nAs a professional programmer, changing this to be an option or simply not deleting the file on the system is elementary. It would take a few minutes to fix. A complex solution to backup old files (in case of bugs or the desire to scum save) is also elementary. Even clearing them out after a week to prevent the hard drive from filling up (which is unnecessary since these save files are so insignificantly tiny) is an elementary thing.\n\nAs a game designer, there is absolutely no reason not to make this an option. We're just lucky these guys are fanatical permadeath devs, maybe big nerds, but nothing else.)\n\nIn other words: MAKE IT AN OPTION. How hard is that to grasp? Why deny the player that control in a singleplayer game? There is NO reason to deny them. There is NO excuse, technically. You are without excuse to not empower players rather than try to force them to play in your misguided way.","January 2","false","34.4"," 11 of 31 people (35%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","35","11","31","4","12"

You can choose both the companions you want to take with you, and the perks  you gain each expedition, making for many different play-styles. The most important thing in an early access game is a good core concept, which this game has. Some more options would be welcome, such as more FTL-style "special" options when you have the right companion, perk or item. There are some, but this aspect could be expanded on. Also, there should be a doctor companion, both for practical reasons, and as it would be fitting to the setting.\nThe biggest criticisms at this point are game breaking bugs, and that the difficulty level can sometimes be obnoxious. Sanity seems to drop too fast, and when it's out, the companions start killing each other too quickly.  As for the combat, most enemies seem to  be able to wipe out the party alarmingly quickly, although I may need more practice. On that note, the tutorial seems quite anemic, with most aspects of the game unexplained.\nThe core game play is solid though. A little expansion, balancing and debugging, and this will be a great game,  well worth supporting.","November 16, 2015","true","63.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Maybe add a list of top 10 highest fame (completed)runs or make unlocking characters a bit more difficult and award at the end of a single playthrough or even a simple tally of completed runs would be nice.

I say that it is amazing because it is a chllenging, fun, interesting game that takes a long time to master. Something that is great about it is the diversity of what you can do. Very replayable.  While after ten or so playthoughs you may start to see the same things, but this is because the game is still in alpha- I am sure there were be many more items by full release. I have had about 40 playthoughs so far and the game is still great. It takes a lot of luck and skill to do well in.\n\nI'll tell you some of the things that might happen.\n\nSo you start the game and head over to a village. You see that the natives have a stone idol sitting in the centre of their village. You give them all whisky, they go to sleep, and you nick the idol and run off. The villagers are furious, chase after you, but you run through the forest to a small mountainous area. You know they will catch you soon, so you go to a temple nearby. It has a golden statue inside. You take it. Suddenly mountains rise out of the ground and block the villagers out. This is a lucky situation.\n\nIn a different playthrough, you find a small egg and keep it. It hatches into a tortoise, named Mr Twinkles, and joins your trek. You run out of food. You trek members go insane and leave. You are forced to eat Mr Twinkles. This is an unlucky playthrough.\n\nNo matter how well you go, this is a brilliant game. While I do think $15 is a little much for an alpha edition, it is worth it, but if you aren't so excited about it you might want to wait fo a sale.","June 4, 2015","true","28.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I finally got past the third expedition AND with my entire original crew!  I got to max them up all their levels, had two butterfly nets with the perk of gained sanity with each butterfly catch.  On top of finally having good sanity I had several binoculars, sight perks and almost all sanity perks. Tubman kept finding treasure and fame grew to over 900 on the fifth leg of our journey!  I think we even had a donkey AND a tortoise so nothing stood in our way as we faced the final trip.\n\nI was able to explore the whole land quickly and found what treasures I intended to take without upsetting the natives until the last possible moment.  I then made my break for the golden temple only to discover that I needed three moon stones to unlock.  Fortunately I had one but had intentionally skipped a temple because I did not want to risk a flood, sinkhole or UNLEASH THE FIRES OF MOUNT DOOM.  So with some sanity to spare I made my way down to discover... a parchment paper.  I then realized that I had explored every place save for the caves themselves, but had traded my torches for treasure at the local village... 115 sanity away.  So with only 15 sanity left I began back only to have my whole crew turn cannibal, or crazy until it was just me and my tortoise.  I reached the village... with 2 standing left only to have the villagers chase me out refusing to trade.  I then wandered the desert with my tortoise until I became hungry.

For gamers such as myself that have been gaming for 20+ years, it allows a sense of nostalgia from games of my youth. It's a colorful, vibrant appearance that even in the games darker moments, it still has an appealing taste.\n\nI love the idea that the only narration in the game comes from stylized journal entries. It really adds to the immersion that you really are part of the expedition...vaguely reminds me of the older "Oregon Trail" (why are there no oregon trail games on steam?) games, but with a nice, animated scene to help you imagine the scenario at hand.\n\nThe open-world, rogue-like gameplay is well thought out. Forcing you to search actively for landmarks and assets in the wilderness, while providing vague clues as to what direction you should follow. My only experience with rogue-likes has been "Neo Scavenger," and I enjoy the style. Again, reminding me of archaic titles I grew up with, and board games I could never get anyone to play as a kid....however this leads me into my grips with the game, and why I really don't play it any more beyond 3 hours.\n\nTo me, the inventory system is flawed. A party of a handful of people, and a pack mule ought to be able to carry a vast array of supplies for an expedition...I think at the most, I had like 8-10 slots available (inventory size is relative to # of people and # of animals in party). Only 1 type of item can occupy a slot, but can be stacked in quantity in the same slot - regardless of object size...so an ancient mummy takes up the same space in the inventory as a sack of marbles. I got irritated trying to manage having enough bartering goods on hand, vs enough 'morale food' (whiskey, chocolate, etc. to boost 'sanity,' which gradually drains as you move around the map), vs enough tools (machetes, climbing gear, dynamite, to navigate treacherous terrain) vs relics and souvineirs (to boost my final score) to progress. 8-10 slots is too few for 3 people and their donkey, sorry...The cumulative party inventory size for a crew of that size seems like the inventory for 1-2 people with no animals.\n\nSo because I couldn't properly equip myself (in my opinion) I had a hard time with people deserting me, and in one instance, catching my donkey muttering to himself (I'm guessing a coding error, as it is a 'random encounter' intended for a human party member...I got a laugh out of it though). I understand the game is meant to be challenging, I do. My first playthrough on the first round, I finished, and thought to myself 'Wow, I did it in a timely manner, brought everyone home, and even a souvenier! No fights with locals, or wildlife, I'm doing great!" ....No such luck. Not only did I come in last - It was by a HUGE margin. I have no idea how the computer expeditions are scored, but something seems off, since they always recieve enormous amounts of points...maybe it's a union thing, i don't know.\n\nI respect the game however, and maybe I'm doing something wrong. I will continue to follow it, and try again occasionally, I simply don't enjoy it.\n\n\n\n","August 1, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

First off it is fun, the most important thing for a game to be. The varied environments and random nature of the game means that it has a good replayability. The combat requires you to think about what you're doing and is random enough that it's unpredictable, but not so random that it's ridiculous.\n\nSecond, it's challenging. Finding all of the seals, stones or whatever else you need to access the pyramid can have you scrambling across the map. You run out of sanity as you move around and can replenish this with different foods or resting in certain locations. You have to deliberately decide where to move otherwise you will eat through your sanity like mad. The creatures in the game range from weak hyenas, to raptor packs that will anihallate all but the strongest parties. As of the time of me writing this review, I've beaten all 6 expeditions once after 6 hours of playing. My only criticism of difficulty is that deaths can be extremely random.\n\nThird, the game is funny. From alcoholic nuns to cultists that are afraid of butterflies, your party members can be amusing as well as helpful.  I had a party member kill off all the other party members because he was convince they were trying to kill me.... or were they? I sold a nun into slavery to buy a native scout. And I talked to my buffalo for several nights before I ate it and then was apparently sad about that.","August 3, 2015","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lead a team of intrepid explorers on increasingly difficult expeditions, as they battle everything from giant gorillas to mummies. Their greatest adversary, however, is not the beasts, but their own sanity. As they penetrate ever deeper into the dense jungles or barren deserts, their minds deteriorate. When you run out of water, machetes, and similar tools required to cope with the climate and terrain, the process accelerates. This is when hilarity ensues as the dark humour starts to shine through in earnest. Redcoats with drinking problems may turn into paranoid cannibals, reckless use of ancient spells may transform the most trusty follower into a flesh-eating abomination, and one by one your expedition will succumb to the madness.\n\nAnyone with even a vague appreciation for tongue-in-cheek 19th century-style exploration (i.e. plundering), the Indiana Jones movies and/or Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (or Coppola's Apocalypse Now for that matter) will find plenty of amusing references to chuckle over.\n\nIn gameplay terms, it's a pretty classic roguelike, with plenty of similarities with FTL. The combat system is easy enough to grasp once you've learned the basics (combos are key, as are balancing defensive and offensive moves), but deep enough to keep you entertained. It's challenging, but not absurdly difficult (unlike many other roguelikes), with a high replayability value.\n\nI tip my jungle helmet to the devs, and thrust myself into the jungle once more.

When I returned to London that unlocked a special area for my fourth expedition: an area secreted in a volcano shell in North America! I had been mercilessly hunting every wild animal in sight and was loaded with funds from selling the pelts, so I stocked up and ventured forth!\nA few days into the journey my expedition came upon 2 Raptors! They proved no match for my guns and advanced tactics and I harvested their skins and feasted on their meat. It was delicious. A month later I found a raptor hatching ground, with a live egg! I took it with me, expecting to sell it back in London for a fortune. Shortly after this something strange happened, even by the standards of a prehistoric expedition! I found a village, not of humans, but of Lizard People! Luckily I was skilled with languages and was able to communicate with the natives. When I asked if any would wish to accompany me I was offered the service of a dinosaur! The Chasmosaur put my Donkey to shame with it's ability to carry my gear, so I left the Donkey to find its way in this strange land and continued on. After several fights with other Raptors and Giant Birds my egg hatched, a tiny Velociraptor had emerged! Of course I kept the little thing with us and carried on. Shortly after that we found the Golden Temple and made our triumphant return to England.\nWith the treasures I had accumulated in that wonderful land I became famous and wealthy beyond imagining! I upgraded the already impressive carrying capacity of my Chasmosaur, stocked up on tons of supplies, and decided to explore another prehistoric location. This time I was in Australia and everything proceeded as before, when my Raptor was fully grown I dismissed my Sailor, over the protestations of my Cook and Soldier, and made room for my new scaly friend. Mounted upon his back we progressed! Everything seemed to be going so well, until I came to a Shrine. I was familiar with the normal traps in these structures and foolishly decided to loot it before sufficiently exploring the area. We barely managed to outrun the lake that spread across the entire region, but worst of all when the dust cleared I was stranded! Barely a few parcels of land surrounded by impassable mountains and depthless lakes! I was forced to construct a balloon and leave most of the treasure, including what I had looted from the shrine, behind as my companions and I escaped back to London. My rivals successful expeditions allowed them catch up, and in some cases surpass, my fame.\nUndaunted I prepared for the sixth, and final, expedition. There was only one choice that could cement my victory, a primeval location in Africa. Having spent most of my funds on the previous expedition I was forced to make do with what little I could still afford, although I was lucky to retain the services of all my companions. We set sail, more determined than ever. After the voyage we immediately saw a pair of Raptor packs patrolling the area, and decided that the best course of action was to stock up on food and trade supplies by righting these creatures. We were successful and had begun to rebuild our stock of supplies. After several months of adventuring, finding keystones and activating mysterious shrines, we had a good stock of supplies, having encountered a brave, wandering merchant several weeks past. Eventually we came upon another shrine, having been unsuccessful in my previous expedition I knew that to truly win this competition I needed the golden treasures, valued greatly by the Explorer's Society, hidden within. I put more effort into preparing this time, clearing out all I needed from the surrounding area before venturing into the forbidden shrine. Inside we went, and two gold idols were inside! I grabbed them and we ran, a vast chasm opened up behind us, yet still we ran, until a mountain showed my lack of planning, slowing us down. The chasm opened beneath our feet and that was the last anyone saw of us.\n...\n\n\n\n\n10/10 Would die again.\nA thoroughly challenging and amazingly fun game. The above was my fourth campaign (although I have watched several LPs of earlier builds), and despite my last minute death, with victory tauntingly close, I was still enthralled. The last game I felt this way about was FTL, and in many ways Curious Expedition reminds me of FTL. You build up your expedition crew, manage inventories, decide how to proceed. If you like rogue-likes, enjoyed FTL, or just have 15$ to spare, I HIHGLY recommend this game.\nEven though it says Early Access the game is very polished, only a few small bugs, and some balance issues, remain.

He asked me to find a buried box and return it back to him. I accepted and promised to find the mysterious box.\n\nDay 1\nA new adventure awaited! I was followed by Brother Cyrus (Missionary), Adèle Popuchet (Artist), Blitz (Hunting dog), Ms. Lawrence (Water Buffalo).\n\nDay 2\nThose were the best days of our venture. We thought nothing would be able to stop our expedition.\n\nDay 4\nWe reached a native village. Its people were spiritual shamans. They observed us with curiousity.\n\nWe decided to stay over night in the village. The villagers shared some valuable information about the whereabouts of the golden pyramid with us. During our stay Adèle Popuchet was able to create a portrait of one of the natives.\n\nDay 6\nEveryone was having a great time. We thought nothing would be able to stop our expedition.\n\nDay 7\nEveryone was having a great time. After all our expedition seemed destined for success.\n\nDay 31\nOur journey led us to a indigenous healer. He cleansed the mental sicknesses of Adèle Popuchet in an unholy ritual.\n\nDay 48\nWe found another cave that led deep into the darkness of a mountain. We discovered a cave that led deep into the darkness of a mountain. A long tunnel stretched in front of us. We moved through the tunnel which, to our surprise, led us to a different region.\n\nDay 59\nA wandering trader had set up camp in this region. We took the opportunity to look at his wares.\n\nDay 61\nI knew we were in a tight spot, but with a bit more luck we might survive this nightmare.\n\nDay 72\nOh how hard it is for me to write these lines. How foolish of us to venture out this far.\n\nDay 76\nWe discovered a cave that led deep into the darkness of a mountain. Inside we found a small underground lake which sustained the growth of many colorful mushrooms.\n\nAdèle Popuchet started behaving strange after the consumption of unidentified mushrooms.\n\nDay 77\nGod save us. Dark, so dark.\n\nDay 88\nToday I found sacrificial offerings at a rock figure. The natives of the region must have placed them there. I found that it wouldn't hurt to take some of them.\n\nDay 99\nMy mind is consumed by the shadows. Dark, so dark.\n\nDay 103\nThat night we ate Blitz for dinner.\n\nDay 105\nI can hardly believe I am still able to write these lines. All I can say is that we are alive.\n\nDay 113\nWe discovered a cave leading into a mountain. We were shocked when we found the remains of what seemed to be a failed expedition. One of the rotten crates still held some valuable equipment.\n\nDay 119\nWe defended ourselves against a giant bird.\n\nWe decided it was better to run away. Ms. Lawrence was lost as we ran away from a combat.\n\nDay 121\nThe land is eating us. What have we done?\n\nDay 123\nWe found another a cave leading into a mountain. Inside there was a small opening that only one person could explore. We sent Brother Cyrus to explore the opening. After some time he returned with valuables.\n\nWe ignored the scientists warning and opened the mysterious box. Inside we found a dead cat, which quickly shrinked down into an ever growing darkness that started to eat up the whole expedition area. We should have listened to the warning.\n\nDay 127\nDuring the night Adèle Popuchet could not help her self and devoured Brother Cyrus .\n\nDay 134\nWe explored an ancient shrine. The shrine collapsed and a huge volcano erupted, setting the entire region in flames.\n\nDay 137\nWe fought against a prehistoric bird. We decided it was better to run away.\n\nDay 144\nDuring the night I fear that Adèle Popuchet might want to eat me.

You can choose both the companions you want to take with you, and the perks  you gain each expedition, making for many different play-styles. The most important thing in an early access game is a good core concept, which this game has. Some more options would be welcome, such as more FTL-style "special" options when you have the right companion, perk or item. There are some, but this aspect could be expanded on. Also, there should be a doctor companion, both for practical reasons, and as it would be fitting to the setting.\nThe biggest criticisms at this point are game breaking bugs, and that the difficulty level can sometimes be obnoxious. Sanity seems to drop too fast, and when it's out, the companions start killing each other too quickly.  As for the combat, most enemies seem to  be able to wipe out the party alarmingly quickly, although I may need more practice. On that note, the tutorial seems quite anemic, with most aspects of the game unexplained.\nThe core game play is solid though. A little expansion, balancing and debugging, and this will be a great game,  well worth supporting.","November 16, 2015","true","63.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With multiple rolls per turn and the ability to keep some dice without using them in a turn while subsequently rolling others, they win me over.\n\nThe graphics, while not "next gen", feel like they belong to the game and do not take from the experience in anyway. The simplicity (not to discredit the artists) of the graphics makes in easy to differentiate between land tiles, while also making the game brilliantly colorful.\n\nGameplay is great! Movement is based on "Sanity" and while you can move with 0 sanity, you'll be in for a surprise if you do (I recommend doing it every so often just for the experience, just don't do it in a game you're trying to win in. :P) The party members all have unique qualities (some good some bad), which make some better defensively, offensively and even gives healing abilities. Additionally they have qualities that improve the overall game, like allowing you to carry more, or give them more health. That said they also can have things like Kleptomaniac or Racist, which can be super harmful for your group.\n\nCurrently there is no save function (As of build 0.17.1) so the game plays like a rogue-like which is fine with me. Some may not enjoy that aspect of it, but to me it adds to the suspense of the game. Knowing that one wrong move could be the end of the expedition is thrilling.\n\nAnyway I hope this review was helpful to you!","September 18, 2015","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't stop playing it. I don't even know what keeps drawing me back, is it the fact that it's difficult and addicting? Maybe. Although I can't argue that this game isn't a stretch from excellent, and it's still in early access. Its simple design, but wide range of features makes for an amazing experience.\n\nI can't wait to see what future updates have for this game, since I already love it so much. Dinosaur mounts, giant turtles, and all sorts of different surprises are my favorite things about this game. -SPOLIER- (sort of not really) The void thing is something I don't understand very well, it's a bit weird how it just consumes everything. However I figured out how to avoid them completely, every time I see a celestial ruins I'm like "NOPENOPENOPE" -Spoiler over-\n\nSomething I would like to see added is the ability to tame mobs, like how you can get a Hyena from the "beast master" when they're around. However instead a bit different, like how there are white tigers, but you can only kill them for their pelt. How cool would it be if you could have a white tiger mount? Sure people could argue that's unrealistic, but so are dinosaurs. I like the innovative creativeness of this game and look forward to seeing it expand.\n\nThere are a fair amount of places to visit in the game, jungles, drylands, and desserts. Considering this is a game about exploring, it seems very fitting and the tombs are interesting as well. It already feels like a complete game, and amazes me that it's still in alpha, it's definitely worth the money.\n\nHowever the game is actually fairly difficult, and might not be the best game for casual gamers.

A good kind of bizarre, but bizarre. There's a lot of various resource management, fun exploration, combat that absolutely hates you despite it being well made along with a great deal of content. No two trips are alike. You will develop a great hatred for all things in this world; from the fauna to the shinies you are meant to steal to the whiny inhabitants. I'm just desecrating and defiling your holy grounds! Whats to hate?\nOn a more serious aside this game is a great deal of fun but it is not without its kinks. After the 5th expedition my game simply crashes. Also some things make no sense. For example: hiring people from villages reduces your standing with the local populace. So, somehow, me bringing one of theirs along with me and paying them makes them hate me? Also I don't fully understand why sleeping in one of their villages would make them hate me.\nIf these adventures with reading and extreme amounts of exploration suit your fancy then you owe it yourself to check this out.

Each expedition is different than the last and that adds extreme replay value.  MY ONE CRITIQUE, needing a Necessary item to be able to enter the golden pyramid (AKA the finish line) feels really cheap from a game standpoint, especially since I don't know what Item I need until i'm there.  There have been some really intense expeditions where I just barely survived, many times the sole survivor.  I see the golden pyramid and there is such a massive relief that I overcame the odds and will live to tell the tale.  Just when I push the button to enter the pyramid it shows that I do not have the required artifact or what not.  Considering that I was out of sanity when I got there, and I'm in the middle of nowhere, I have to simply accept my fate and die.  Since the maps are procedurally generated, theres a good chance I haven't even come across the artifact in question.  Just really puts a damper on the whole experience, to the point of needing to turn the game off for a while for being cheated out of one hell of a victory.

So I'd recomend playing the game through to the number one explorer as each character.\nThe art-style/pixil-art is very nice on the eyes and keeps the explorer theme going.\nOne part the game thrives in is the ability to tell you own stories. like how on the rush to find the golden pyramid I ran out of chocolate and James Stirling the diplomat ate my British soldier and my native warrior.

This game takes what would be a great table-top experience and combines with it the ability of a computer to spare you tedious rolls of "what are the six hexes surrounding this one?" This game takes a board-game system and beefs it up with a program that'll roll through the doldrums.\n\nWholly playable, rewardingly-difficult, and most-of-all engaging: Curious Expedition is wonderful. The devs are calling this an alpha build, and it's a full game from the first day it has been on Steam. Early access came about because, after Minecraft, we all hoped it'd be great games that just got better. And then we all got let down because most were scams. This one isn't. This game is worth twice its price in exactly its current state. If you see the videos and are wondering "but it's Early Access, so is it just going to be another dropped project?" Let me re-assure you that, if you purchase it, you won't care. This is one that, if no additional builds are ever released for, you'll still be glad to have purchased.","May 22, 2015","true","70.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoyed this game a lot and wished it would be remade. "The Curious Expedition" is the closest thing I would get to that and it's awesome! The Curious Expedition is a strategy and resource management game with an Indiana Jones theme. You explore exotic regions around the world in search of treasures, fame, and fortune. Much like The Lost Tribe, you move from tile to tile across the map in order to find the end location. In Tribe, it was a volcano. In Expedition, it's a golden pyramid. Comparing both games, Expedition is somewhat easier than Tribe. But both games offer plenty of challenge and a lot of fun.

I do believe it should be a little less money though($15 would be good) so if you have the patience (which i didn't) you should wait until it goes on sale. It has a high replay ability  because you have many playable characters with different traits, there is also many different types of characters that can join your trek with different traits. You can have a cannibal, racist, acholic, kleptomania, claustrophobic, and more i haven't seen, I'm sure they are probably adding more too. For "Early Access" game its feels like a finished game. It does need some sound effects, which i believe they are working on.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krowasian/recommended/358130/","krowasian","Quetzalcoatl","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krowasian/","577 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nBest early access game that I've played.\nHands down.\n\nWorth the $15 it costs even at this early stage. I admit though that I am positively biased toward a game with its theme on exploration during the 1800s. Nonetheless, here's the breakdown (possible spoilers?):\n\nGraphics (8/10):\nIn no way are the graphics anything to brag about, but that's part of The Curious Expedition's charm (and common among Rogue-like adventure games). The characters, landscapes, and backgrounds are quite colorful and it is fun to see such charming sprites wiggle across the dangerous terrain. The ease on processors is a bonus as well.\n\nAudio (6/10):\nThe music is enjoyable and sets the atmosphere for the time period quite well. Although, the tracks are short (specifically in the menu and pre-exploration areas) and I found myself a little disengaged when they would abruptly stop and start again.\n\nGameplay (10/10):\nI am negatively biased toward Rogue-like games as I pretty much suck at them, so this particular rating should speak volumes. In no way is this an easy game (I died countless times), but I found myself emersed in the game, not realizing that 8 hours had passed the first session I played it.\nDecisions are made through simple point-and-click gameplay, though they are almost always consequence-based decisions: choosing an explorer, each with their own set of perks, companions, and gear; choosing how to deal with natives and their sacred places and objects; deciding what to do with unruly companions, what items to keep or leave behind, and what possibly rewarding objects to hold on to or use for its unique and magical benefit; finally, the most punishing decisions being which way to travel, and, seeing as it costs sanity, making mistakes can cause loss of party members, gear, eventually fame and forutne, and even the expedition itself.\nOther than the decision-based part of the game, there is dice-based combat against beasts and angry natives. There are three types of dice (attack, defense, and support), the amount of which is determined by party member skills and abilities, and combining them in different ways produces different results for damaging your opponent or blocking your opponent's attacks. Personally, I like a simple system with complex results, which is exactly what this combat system is.\n\nStory (7/10):\nThe story is simple as you play the part of an explorer seeking fame and fortune in the wilder parts of the world. The story changes with every playthrough as the events that the explorer goes through actually make up the story itself. Other than that, there is almost no story, but this doesn't take away from the game as much as actually add to it. Because your unique actions per playthrough create a unique story each time, the narrative relies on the player, and therefore makes for exciting expectations. A post-adventure transcription of the events of each expedition is desirable though.\n\nReplayability (10/10):\nI have played it over and over, each time having a different experiance. The maps seem to be randomly generated and each encounter has many different possible outcomes. It took many playthroughs just to beat it (finally!) and I don't expect the next time I beat it to be any time soon or in anyway the same as the first time. I will say that there are a few difficulties that can be avoided once you get over the games learning curve and pick up a few tricks, therefore making later playthroughs a bit easier, although this doesn't take any enjoyment away from the game, in fact making it more enjoyable knowing that you are using your newfound skills and being rewarded for it. On top of that, there is replayability in: beating the game with each character, making different choices for encounters you've had before just to see the outcome, and not just beating the game but getting 1st place in fame among your fellow explorers.\nTotal: 8.2/10\nNoteable Mentions:\nCanniblism\nAbominations\nBeing a d*ck to natives\nDinosaurs in the 1800s\nNikola Tesla and his Tesla Gun\nSelling your companions into slavery\nA Giant Tortoise you can raise as a pet from birth\nBlackholes as punishment for taking treasure that you shouldn't've\nThe Curious Expedition Main Website[www.curious-expedition.com]\nThe Curious Expedition Wiki[curious-expedition.wikia.com]","May 31, 2015","true","53.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game has rich emergent stories and proves immersive game after game. The game mechanics are carefully designed to force the player to wrestle with difficult decisions like 'if I dump my rations to carry more loot, will I make it home in time before we all go insane?'. The combat system is particularly original and ensures that even non-military characters have important roles to play in combat situations.

For gamers such as myself that have been gaming for 20+ years, it allows a sense of nostalgia from games of my youth. It's a colorful, vibrant appearance that even in the games darker moments, it still has an appealing taste.\n\nI love the idea that the only narration in the game comes from stylized journal entries. It really adds to the immersion that you really are part of the expedition...vaguely reminds me of the older "Oregon Trail" (why are there no oregon trail games on steam?) games, but with a nice, animated scene to help you imagine the scenario at hand.\n\nThe open-world, rogue-like gameplay is well thought out. Forcing you to search actively for landmarks and assets in the wilderness, while providing vague clues as to what direction you should follow. My only experience with rogue-likes has been "Neo Scavenger," and I enjoy the style. Again, reminding me of archaic titles I grew up with, and board games I could never get anyone to play as a kid....however this leads me into my grips with the game, and why I really don't play it any more beyond 3 hours.\n\nTo me, the inventory system is flawed. A party of a handful of people, and a pack mule ought to be able to carry a vast array of supplies for an expedition...I think at the most, I had like 8-10 slots available (inventory size is relative to # of people and # of animals in party). Only 1 type of item can occupy a slot, but can be stacked in quantity in the same slot - regardless of object size...so an ancient mummy takes up the same space in the inventory as a sack of marbles. I got irritated trying to manage having enough bartering goods on hand, vs enough 'morale food' (whiskey, chocolate, etc. to boost 'sanity,' which gradually drains as you move around the map), vs enough tools (machetes, climbing gear, dynamite, to navigate treacherous terrain) vs relics and souvineirs (to boost my final score) to progress. 8-10 slots is too few for 3 people and their donkey, sorry...The cumulative party inventory size for a crew of that size seems like the inventory for 1-2 people with no animals.\n\nSo because I couldn't properly equip myself (in my opinion) I had a hard time with people deserting me, and in one instance, catching my donkey muttering to himself (I'm guessing a coding error, as it is a 'random encounter' intended for a human party member...I got a laugh out of it though). I understand the game is meant to be challenging, I do. My first playthrough on the first round, I finished, and thought to myself 'Wow, I did it in a timely manner, brought everyone home, and even a souvenier! No fights with locals, or wildlife, I'm doing great!" ....No such luck. Not only did I come in last - It was by a HUGE margin. I have no idea how the computer expeditions are scored, but something seems off, since they always recieve enormous amounts of points...maybe it's a union thing, i don't know.\n\nI respect the game however, and maybe I'm doing something wrong. I will continue to follow it, and try again occasionally, I simply don't enjoy it.\n\n\n\n","August 1, 2015","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Game balance seems to be odd in that you have to balance just a bit too many things (and I say this as a Nethack enthusiast) but that just means some runs will be doomed to fail, while almost every other run will be difficult.\n\nAll in all, very fun, hopefully development will continue at the same pace.","August 8, 2015","true","5.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You chose a famous person from that time era (usually not even an explorer) and help them discover 6 golden pyramids so they have have a statue made of them.\n\nThe game is mostly resource and perk management, but despite that, it never really gets old. Combat is totally optional and is a completely unique engine which stands out from all others and is generally fun once you understand it.\n\nAs you move through the world, you take sanity damage (recieving more based on harsher environments). To refill your sanity, you need to eat, drink, or rest. This is merely one aspect of the resource management and you must always be prepared.\n\nAdditionally, you need to fund your next expedition and to do that, you need to come back with treasures and decide if you will gift them to a museum, sell them for funds, or trade them with natives. Be careful though, because each time you steal from a sacred temple, it makes the natives in that region angry at you. This is a really good risk/reward system. Especially since your treasures share inventory space with your guns, food, torches, and other equipment.\n\nAlso, you can train a velociraptor or triceratops as your pet, so that's pretty schanzzzy\n\nI really wish they would add Ernest Shackleton, Roald Amundsen, or even Robert Falcon Scott.\nShackleton would be the easiest and you could even give him a special perk called: "ENDURANCE"\n\nAnyway, despite it's steep price (for an indie game) and that it rarely goes on sale, I recommend this and consider it to be my favorite game that I purchased in 2015.","January 5","true","23.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With multiple rolls per turn and the ability to keep some dice without using them in a turn while subsequently rolling others, they win me over.\n\nThe graphics, while not "next gen", feel like they belong to the game and do not take from the experience in anyway. The simplicity (not to discredit the artists) of the graphics makes in easy to differentiate between land tiles, while also making the game brilliantly colorful.\n\nGameplay is great! Movement is based on "Sanity" and while you can move with 0 sanity, you'll be in for a surprise if you do (I recommend doing it every so often just for the experience, just don't do it in a game you're trying to win in. :P) The party members all have unique qualities (some good some bad), which make some better defensively, offensively and even gives healing abilities. Additionally they have qualities that improve the overall game, like allowing you to carry more, or give them more health. That said they also can have things like Kleptomaniac or Racist, which can be super harmful for your group.\n\nCurrently there is no save function (As of build 0.17.1) so the game plays like a rogue-like which is fine with me. Some may not enjoy that aspect of it, but to me it adds to the suspense of the game. Knowing that one wrong move could be the end of the expedition is thrilling.\n\nAnyway I hope this review was helpful to you!","September 18, 2015","true","13.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

You can choose both the companions you want to take with you, and the perks  you gain each expedition, making for many different play-styles. The most important thing in an early access game is a good core concept, which this game has. Some more options would be welcome, such as more FTL-style "special" options when you have the right companion, perk or item. There are some, but this aspect could be expanded on. Also, there should be a doctor companion, both for practical reasons, and as it would be fitting to the setting.\nThe biggest criticisms at this point are game breaking bugs, and that the difficulty level can sometimes be obnoxious. Sanity seems to drop too fast, and when it's out, the companions start killing each other too quickly.  As for the combat, most enemies seem to  be able to wipe out the party alarmingly quickly, although I may need more practice. On that note, the tutorial seems quite anemic, with most aspects of the game unexplained.\nThe core game play is solid though. A little expansion, balancing and debugging, and this will be a great game,  well worth supporting.","November 16, 2015","true","63.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Gather loot and fame, but don't vex the natives too much or they may hunt you down and take your head.  Survive by eating chocolate and drinking whiskey and if you need,  hunt Raptors for their meat.  Run out of food, become insane and some of your traveling mates may even try to eat you or each other.\n\nObject of the game is to become the most famous explorer, which is accomplished over six missions by finding precious artifacts and the golden pyramid.  Top your high score or unlock more explorers by accomplishing certain goals.\n\nGame mechanics and combat is governed by RNG, but most decisions are in your hands, such as leveling up, what equipment you bring on an expedition, where you explore.  Do you steal every artifact you find only to anger the natives or do play nice with natives to help you find the golden pyramid?\n\nThe choice is yours.  Highly recommend buying the game.  Already played for 26 hours and plan to play some more.\n\nDeveloper is very responsive to the community.","March 10","true","26.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I can't stop playing it. I don't even know what keeps drawing me back, is it the fact that it's difficult and addicting? Maybe. Although I can't argue that this game isn't a stretch from excellent, and it's still in early access. Its simple design, but wide range of features makes for an amazing experience.\n\nI can't wait to see what future updates have for this game, since I already love it so much. Dinosaur mounts, giant turtles, and all sorts of different surprises are my favorite things about this game. -SPOLIER- (sort of not really) The void thing is something I don't understand very well, it's a bit weird how it just consumes everything. However I figured out how to avoid them completely, every time I see a celestial ruins I'm like "NOPENOPENOPE" -Spoiler over-\n\nSomething I would like to see added is the ability to tame mobs, like how you can get a Hyena from the "beast master" when they're around. However instead a bit different, like how there are white tigers, but you can only kill them for their pelt. How cool would it be if you could have a white tiger mount? Sure people could argue that's unrealistic, but so are dinosaurs. I like the innovative creativeness of this game and look forward to seeing it expand.\n\nThere are a fair amount of places to visit in the game, jungles, drylands, and desserts. Considering this is a game about exploring, it seems very fitting and the tombs are interesting as well. It already feels like a complete game, and amazes me that it's still in alpha, it's definitely worth the money.\n\nHowever the game is actually fairly difficult, and might not be the best game for casual gamers. I find that anyone who loves rts like I do, will definitely love this game.","February 28","true","30.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Reminds me of playing  Seven Cities of Gold  and  Heart of Africa  on my C64 back in the day; even the pixel graphics give it a feel of yesteryear, while still being updated to modern standards (well modern-retro if you know what I mean).\n\nI just started playing since version Alpha 26 with the addition of an Easy Mode and Normal mode (Hard mode not yet done).  Easy mode is very forgiving and a good way to learn the mechanics/concepts without necessarily dying right off (or if you just want to "create a story" without a significant challange of dying/ending early).  Playing through easy, I could see at what points my poor decisions would have killed me in the normal mode.   Normal mode is much harder, more of a "fair" challange; actually can be fairly difficult up front.   New exployers to open up, random maps, random encouters/events and people/villagers with some personality keep the game fresh (mind you I've only played through a few times at this point).  Game seems very stable at this point (I did have a freeze up in the tutorial, but couldn't replicate the issue).   A play through will likely last an hour or 2 depending on your style and luck.\n\nA fun game worth a buy now and it should only get better as it gets closer to actual release.","April 2","true","9.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is early access and I feel like I have bought a full on complete game. It is hard for me to describe the type of game this is... It's an adventure/rng/rouglike amazing-ness. I have logged a decent number of hours into this game already and still feel like I can play more. There have been some great updates since I have started playing The Curious Expedition and i have to say I have enjoyed all of them. There is a bit of a learning curve involved but it isn't a hard game to figure out, it will just take time. If I had to pick a favorite thing about this game it would be the team building, it can be done in many ways and still be succeful and change how you play through the game greatly. I would recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of a difficult, fun, rewarding, and addictive game.\n\nPros:\n-Great game, very fun and addicting (not many games hook me like this one has)\n-Very good replay value, every game can be completely different\n-Original game type, never played anything quite like this\n-Very much a game of pro/con choice making that can lead to great reward or total defeat\n-Hasn't gotten old after many fun hours of gameplay\n-Good amount of strategy and thought needs to be put into how you will play through\n-Feels like the game grows very often with new things to experience and accomplish\n-Very stable, one crash out of all my hours of gameplay\n\nCons:\n-No real story (I  guess you make your own)\n-No narration\n-Music can become a little annoying (honestly I don't think its too bad, my wife doesnt like it)\n-Can become very dissapointing when you lose over one wrong move or a bit of bad luck\n-Unforgiving\n\n\nTL;DR\nGreat game, lots to do and learn, seems to be updated on the reg. The price may put some people off of the 2d pixel graphics but i really feel like I have gotten my money's worth so far with nearly 40hrs of gameplay and more to come. I look forward to the future of this game and others this company may release.\n\nLet me know how my first review was, I feel like I should write more of them because I do find them helpful sometimes.\n\nDon't let the greed ruin your life...","March 29","true","39.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lead a team of intrepid explorers on increasingly difficult expeditions, as they battle everything from giant gorillas to mummies. Their greatest adversary, however, is not the beasts, but their own sanity. As they penetrate ever deeper into the dense jungles or barren deserts, their minds deteriorate. When you run out of water, machetes, and similar tools required to cope with the climate and terrain, the process accelerates. This is when hilarity ensues as the dark humour starts to shine through in earnest. Redcoats with drinking problems may turn into paranoid cannibals, reckless use of ancient spells may transform the most trusty follower into a flesh-eating abomination, and one by one your expedition will succumb to the madness.\n\nAnyone with even a vague appreciation for tongue-in-cheek 19th century-style exploration (i.e. plundering), the Indiana Jones movies and/or Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness (or Coppola's Apocalypse Now for that matter) will find plenty of amusing references to chuckle over.\n\nIn gameplay terms, it's a pretty classic roguelike, with plenty of similarities with FTL. The combat system is easy enough to grasp once you've learned the basics (combos are key, as are balancing defensive and offensive moves), but deep enough to keep you entertained. It's challenging, but not absurdly difficult (unlike many other roguelikes), with a high replayability value.\n\nI tip my jungle helmet to the devs, and thrust myself into the jungle once more.

You chose a famous person from that time era (usually not even an explorer) and help them discover 6 golden pyramids so they have have a statue made of them.\n\nThe game is mostly resource and perk management, but despite that, it never really gets old. Combat is totally optional and is a completely unique engine which stands out from all others and is generally fun once you understand it.\n\nAs you move through the world, you take sanity damage (recieving more based on harsher environments). To refill your sanity, you need to eat, drink, or rest. This is merely one aspect of the resource management and you must always be prepared.\n\nAdditionally, you need to fund your next expedition and to do that, you need to come back with treasures and decide if you will gift them to a museum, sell them for funds, or trade them with natives. Be careful though, because each time you steal from a sacred temple, it makes the natives in that region angry at you. This is a really good risk/reward system. Especially since your treasures share inventory space with your guns, food, torches, and other equipment.\n\nAlso, you can train a velociraptor or triceratops as your pet, so that's pretty schanzzzy\n\nI really wish they would add Ernest Shackleton, Roald Amundsen, or even Robert Falcon Scott.\nShackleton would be the easiest and you could even give him a special perk called: "ENDURANCE"\n\nAnyway, despite it's steep price (for an indie game) and that it rarely goes on sale, I recommend this and consider it to be my favorite game that I purchased in 2015.","January 5","true","23.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Beautiful art, actual historical figures, people with flaws and strengths on your team, lizard men, fighting mummies, tons of different terrain types, and now three difficulties. There is literally almost nothing wrong about this game, except perhaps that it could use even more adventure story elements interlaced with it. I'd enjoy some sort of materials gathering minigame, myself.","June 4","true","51.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
