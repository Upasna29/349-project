If you are using guides like my walkthrough and cut down dialogues you will obvious run through the game much faster and can beat it in 5 to 6 hours I would guess.","February 25","true","10.8"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","19","29","0","0"

Η περιπέτεια του Talorel έχει όλα τα στοιχεία που είναι ικανά να την τοποθετήσουν μεταξύ εκείνων που θα ολοκληρώσετε με μεγάλη διάθεση, αφήνοντας ως σημαντικότερη παρακαταθήκη της την εξ' αρχής ανοικτή δράση της και ορισμένους ευφυείς γρίφους που περιλαμβάνει.\n\nThe debut game of Mosaic Mask Studio leaves us with great promises for this company’s future activity. Talorel’s journey has all the necessary elements for a pleasant and satisfying adventure game, with smart puzzles and many accessible locations right from the beginning being the most important ones.\n\nhttp://ragequit.gr/reviews/item/heaven-s-hope-pc-review","February 27","true","19.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Excellent for everyone, and I wholeheartedly recommend it if you’re looking for a new adventure game. I had a lot of fun with this one, and finished it in one long sitting.

It really doesn’t have a ton to offer veteran players, and the challenge is almost non-existent.  Worst of all, the game feels like one of those Christian pamphlets you get on your car window.  Given the subject matter however, it is refreshing that the game condemns zealotry while promoting rationalism.  I enjoyed the spiritual and moral aspects of the storyline, but it really isn’t enough to convince anyone to sit through the whole game to its lazy conclusion.  It lacks the charm to keep kids interested, or the identity to invest grown-person hours into either.  It is however technically impressive, besides a few patchable problems, and has some stunning visuals and memorable moments that may be worth checking out.","February 25","false","81.2"," 9 of 39 people (23%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","23","9","39","0","0"

Talorel, the fallen angel, is a sympathetic protagonist. The concepts for the various puzzles were good, but the implementation could stand some improvement. German voice acting was mostly good, the subtitles had minor bugs. Overall, I liked this game.","April 5","true","10.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
