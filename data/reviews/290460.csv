The nostalgic feeling of difficult games from the 1980s and 1990s, unforgiving and kind of grindy. This game takes more then a few hours of hitting the "Attack" button. It makes you consider your resources carefully.\n\nEngaging in a battle, and just attacking while paying the minimum amount of attention will likely get you killed more often then not. It takes a little planning and some real thought on how to approach the groups of monsters. More then once have I delved into a cave full of monsters, earned a substantial amount of money, just to lose it all on resurrection costs and inn stays. Think about the fight and utilize your characters' abilities. For a while I was using Lionel primarily to First Aid allies that were getting crushed in battle. After a few levels, they easily best groups of enemies.\n\nA lot of reviews make this game out to be bad and hard, and I just didn't think it was fair. By today's standards, yes it could be considered quite brutal at times, but that doesn't make it bad. It makes it challenging. The class system and morality system really make this something I could finish and immediately pick up again.\\n\nThanks for this game!","June 1, 2014","true","40.3"," 39 of 46 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","39","46","0","0"

I'm less than two hours in, and here's what I have to complain about:\n\n1. The dialogue has clearly never been read out loud before. It's awkward, long-winded and bad.\n2. The battles at the beginning are infuriatingly long. Not so much difficult, but long. Also, dear god but the main character misses a lot.\n3. The art for the first boss is out of place, blurry, covered in artifacts, and just plain awful. This game would have been better served by a stock RPGMaker enemy that at least fit the look of the rest of the game.\n4.  When you talk to the sleeping soldiers from different sides, they take on different sprites - an old man, a young girl. This is because the sprite sheet for "fallen" characters have sprites for every character, rather than different directions, because corpses don't turn to look at you. Preventing the fallen sprite from changing when you talk to it is as simple as checking the "Direction Fix" box in the event menu.\n\nOne click. ONE CLICK.\n\nThis is a lazy mistake, and just goes to show the lack of testing, and the overall rushedness of this game. It certianly doesn't bode well for the rest of it, but hey, if it wows me by the end of it, I'll update this review.

But for every enjoyable part, there seemed to be an unequally annoying part that made me forget it shortly after. I often felt that I was playing a contest entry NOT a published product.\n\nEnjoyed: --------------------------------------------------\n- The simple, but well thought class/job choices.\n(One of my annoying list was slightly mitigated by the ability to sub-class everyone as a Cleric.)\n\n- The availability of a multitude of items, with actual utility.\n(making up for possible bad class choice in battle, and when out of mana.)\n\n- A reasonably believable story line.\n(Much less suspension of disbelief is necessary to enjoy it, unlike many JRPG stories.)\n\n- Competent map making.\n(A little boxy, but for RPGMakerXVA default tiles, the attention of variety is acceptable.)\n\n- Market pricing.\n(It is nice that the price of goods and acquisition of money are relatively painless, but not excessive.)\n\nAnnoyed: --------------------------------------------------\n- Complete lack of any quest log.\n(It's nearly impossible to keep track of side quests without writing them down on paper.)\n\n- Painfully linear game play.\n(Everything, including most over land map access is key-to-open, without any reason to return once completed.)\n\n- Long winded and RAMBLING dialogue.\n(To each their own, but after the third 500+ word story sequence, with dramatic pauses and area transitions to boot, I had to FORCE MYSELF to push through them without quitting. Your story is NOT bad, a little cliché but not bad. Do yourself a favor and try not to spell out every detail in WORDS. Leave some of it up to the reader to intuit from setting, animation, and music. It reduces the tedium of reading it, and respects their intelligence at the same time.)\n\n- WTF Difficulty curve!?!\n(I realize that you added a difficulty slider to the options menu, and it works, but the difficulty goes from laughable on CASUAL, to randomly deadly on NORMAL, to survival? ROFLCOPTER! on PURIST. It seems that you are using a random troop member replacement script for battles, and that results in some battles where you MUST escape, or die. Period. And if you aren't using a random replacement script, you must enjoy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off your customers. -- While I can accept this in a scenario where battles are visible, and I have at least a chance to 'chose' them, the default random battle mechanic makes it downright infuriating at times. Ex: The difficulty spike, in NORMAL, inside the second dungeon/cave was enough to finely make me rage quit for the day.)\n\n- What? That was a puzzle?!?\n(At least a few times, I was left to assume that I was looking for an item to 'pass' an obstacle. Neither the obstacle itself, nor the item I found that allowed me to do so, had any indication, in its description or dialogue, of its actual purpose. I either randomly returned, or hoped I was right in back tracking, to discover how they related.)","January 2, 2015","false","4.3"," 24 of 29 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","24","29","0","1"

Yeah, some down characters are buggy (the sprite will change aspect depending on the direction you go. If you use rpg maker, remember kids : never forgt "direction fix" on downed sprites :)   ). Yes, there is a bug with inventory in the very beginning (but not game breaking at all and you really have to do things an unusual way to fall on it so I guess testers can't be blamed for that , believe me, it's easily missed.).\nBut seriously, seriously , really, THIS GAME IS A GEM OF AN RPG.\nIf like me you're a nostalgic of old snes jrpg era you'll freaking LOVE IT. The customisation system of characters is good (you can chose their class and sub-class which allows many different strategies), difficulty so far (i'm at 4 hours of play, finished three bosses) is well balanced. Beware beginners though, it's challenging don't expect to be able to bash "attack attack attack heal attack attack heal" to win it requires more strategy to best your opponents. And this is GREAT.\nThe music....oh God the music is so delightful. It's like if Chrono Trigger's soundtrack met Secret of Mana and decided to go HD with real instruments.\n\nThe storyline is classic but well put together, characters are well written so far. The mapping is good too, you have much things to find out in every area, you don't have useless items or skills, YES , state inflicting skills for once are useful!\n\nDefinetely worth the few bucks required to give it a try. If you loved old Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger, Breath of Fire etc by any mean, BUY THIS.

The game was so inspiring to me.  If you haven't played Legionwood: Tale of the Two Swords, I highly recommend it!  Plus, if you do, you'll be familiar with the setting in this game.\nHowever, that being said, to enjoy this game, one would not have to play through the First Legionwood.\nI really do think it would enhance your experience though!  There are some changes to how you develop your characters this time around, but the overall feeling is still there I think with the new class system.  It's a blast.  The battles are fast & fierce!  Everything is so much smoother!  I grew up playing RPGs and the Final Fantasy games as they were released in the US, and old school RPGs are what I crave these days.  The story is great, and there are many nods to the events in the original.  I find myself never bored at all, and quite honestly, I thought it would be hard to top the first game. But I feel as if Dark Gaia has achieved it! The script is phenomenal, the dialog is fresh, very well written, and the soundtrack for this game is breathtaking.  Now over 13 hours in I can say this game is a masterpiece.  This is such a unique way to continue the story from Legionwood: Tale of the Two Swords, I found myself in awe.  The characters in this game have real personalities, and characterization is a key for good storytelling.  This game has it all.  Do yourself a favor and give it a shot.  Anyone who plays this game for at least a few hours will be completely enthralled.\nIf you are a fan of RPGs, you will love this.","June 6, 2014","true","41.5"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

Well, one of several endings.  I have to say that this game is an exceptional turn based RPG.  Here are a few reasons that I personally enjoyed the game:\n\nThe class system is way more balanced than Final Fantasy ever achieved.  With the right combination of skills and equipment, you can make every class a useful one.  Every character can be developed however you see fit.  There is a lot of replay value in just trying out differently developed characters.\n\nThere are a lot of side quests, but nothing that you have to devote hundreds of hours to complete.\n\nThe story line is fantastic.  It's not over saturated with juvenile snark like most modern games in the genre.  Its a story that grabs you, and compells you to keep playing.  Apparently there are several endings, and decisions you make can affect the endings and storyline.  That also adds to the replay value.\n\nThe difficulty is hard, but reasonable.  You have to apply thought and strategy to get through it, which means it doesn't get very repetitive (except for later dungeons, where the switching mechanisms can drive you nuts!)  But not so nuts that you throw the controller and give up.  A lot of people complain about the difficulty, but if any of you remember playing final fantasy 1 and getting off your ship at the wrong port, or playing Dragon Warrior 1 and crossing one too many bridges, the difficulty doesn't even come close to those days.\n\nThe soundtrack is really good.  I'm not a musical person, but I appreciated the variety of background music.  It set the mood for the different scenes very well.\n\nI'd give this an 8/10, and I personally can't wait to see another Legionwood game.\n\n\n\n","January 9, 2015","true","39.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Neutral, I guess? I don't really know whether to recommend or not recommend, honestly. I guess based upon the fact that I've played for 10+ hours and haven't thrown in the towel would count as a recommend. This game has a lot of flaws, so play at your own discretion.\n\nPros\nA class and sub class option. Nice. I've never seen this. This essentially gives you the power to have a character major in one class and minor in another one. Good when you can make all of your characters clerics if you want. Makes me feel like I can play God a little bit.\n\nEncounter rate is decent. It's high.. but not insanely high. Which is good, because you do battle a lot and it can be tiresome if you're actually trying to make some decent progress. Or, if you're in trouble and you're trying to escape.\n\nDungeons are all a respectable and comfortable length. Not too long.. not too short. This makes it easier to retreat to town if you need healing or items. You can go back in and retrace your steps pretty quickly and make progress at a good pace.\n\nYou can save any where and at any time. Phew. This is a real life saver. They didn't take a page from the ol' "save point" book.\n\nMost tihngs are inexpensive. Reviving your character from the dead is costly, but it's relatively easy to avoid this when you can buy large quanities of items for cheap to help you restore your mp/hp. Inns are also cheap. With all the enemy encounters, you'll also have a hefty amount of cash to buy new equipment in each new area. You have a lot of opportunities to heal/improve yourself BEFORE you die, saving you a headache while also saving you some cash.\n\nThe music is pretty solid. Cons\nYour party's hit rate is atrocious. This is a real problem. Seriously. Even my incredibly speedy Rogue character misses every other turn.. and that's with no added debuffs or status effect. This is frustrating and makes battles more drawn out than they need to be. It doesn't seem to matter your stats, what class you are playing, what equipment you have.. it's just a whole lot of missing for no ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ reason.\n\nLittle to no warning when you're about to run into a boss. This can be remedied by saving frequently.. but come on.\n\nNo quest log. Another serious problem. This makes it really difficult to track quests. There's not even any point in doing them because it's so easy to forget. A real shame.. I feel like side questing should play a big part in RPGs.\n\nTakes forever to level up. This seems to be a weird scaling issue they didn't fix.. because you fight a RIDICULOUS amount in this game.\n\nThere is no "warp" option (so far) to leave an area quickly. This makes traveling/exploring really quite painful. I mentioned above that dungeons aren't terribly long, but it is still a pain in the ♥♥♥ regardless when you have to drag yourself out of the dungeon instead of using a simple spell, item or ability to get yourself out quickly.\n\nThere are a lot of unique sprites, which is nice to see... but what's lacking is portraits next to dialogue boxes when sub or side characters are speaking. This bothers me. All the main characters have portraits next to their dialogue (as they should), but not a single other character has one. Ever. Would it have been so hard to add in? It really puts a hamper on the story telling aspect when they make every other character seem not at all important.\n\nUnpredictable character pathing. When you're in towns, for example, NPCs can box you in and there's not a damn thing you can do about it. Sometimes they don't even move, or don't move in a direction that gives you room to get out.\n\nNo voice overs at all. You have to read all of the clunky and extremely drawn out dialogue. Most of which, over time, you could care less about. I understand this game was most likely a low budget RPG maker type of game to come from an independant/small developer.. but having it read aloud would really make the experience a bit better.\nNow, unfortunately my computer's hard drive died and I lost my save data.. so I never got to finish this game 100%. It wasnt worth restarting just to finish and see the ending in my opinion, nor is it something I'd seriously recommend to a friend. However, I've seen some pretty terrible RPG maker games out there, but this one at least tries a lot of unique things and makes an honest effort.\n\nTry it if you're curious. It's middle ground: there are better, but there are also worse.","October 11, 2015","true","11.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","83","5","6","2","0"

Although I was able to analyse the battle mechanics and world design to quite some depth, I also pointed out weaknesses in the character development, and how information about the world was conveyed to the player. Thankfully, as I played further into the game I found that these problems were addressed, and I felt it would be necessary to re-write my review, and hopefully help the developer in the process. I will avoid all spoilers beyond the first two hours of this game.\n\nIf, like me, you have never played a Legionwood game before, you may wish to brace yourself for the first few hours of the game. The player is assaulted with world information and lore over the first few hours, and I found it very difficult to actually understand what was going on. Naturally it was difficult to become invested in the events of the game at that point. The character development showed similar problems - the main party members were able to supply the player with large quantities of information to keep the story moving, but showed little personality (I was convinced that some characters lacked any personality traits whatsoever - Felix frequently made snide comments or light jokes, and Lionel showed some signs of mourning for Clara, but Aelia and later Marcus showed no detectable emotions or character). Thankfully, as the player progresses further into the story, some of these characters have their background explored, and their personality expanded upon. The story itself becomes easier to follow, too, as characters start to respond to recent events instead of bringing up pieces of lore that the player feels little relation to. The player is able to undertake many side-quests as they progress further in the story, which offer opportunites to improve your party, better pace the events of the main quest, and learn more about specific corners of the world. It's a shame that all of this only picks up after a few (5?) hours of gameplay, but what is present is very well-written, and a definite strength of the game.\n\nThe meat of the game, the battles, are both challenging and satisfying. It is rare to find an RPG with such enjoyable battles, and I'm not just talking about RPG Maker titles. Bear in mind that they do have a high level of difficulty from the start, so if you have never completed a Final Fantasy game, you may want to steer clear from this one to avoid frustration. Personally, I really appreciated the difficulty, and it forced me to think tactically whenever I encountered a strong opponent. The battles are viewed from a side-on perspective (a big plus for me!) with a conditional turn-based system similar to that of Final Fantasy X. This lends a lot to the strategy, as you must consider not only strength and weakness, but also timing and order of the moves you execute. Characters may be assigned classes (think of the jobs systems of the earlier Final Fantasies) that roughly describes what functions they may serve in battle. And since you are unlikely to win all your battles by just repeatedly attacking, there is real value in choosing classes that inflict status conditions, or reduce enemy statistics, or have a higher critical hit ratio, etc. Although I may be asking a bit much, it could have been fun to see the characters develop within their chosen classes and not just as a whole, but the system is fine as it is and I would not wish it to become unbalanced.\n\nThe graphics and sounds are pleasant but not outstanding. The developer has achieved much using the resources supplied with RPG Maker VX, and this is in no way a criticism. The environments are richly detailed - moss growing on cavern walls, tufts of grass amid the odd flower on bright mountain paths, broken furniture and bones littering grey halls in untouched ruins (but who ever heard of doors rotting shut?) The only criticisms I do have are minor, and refer to graphical elements added by the developer: face portraits generally look a little odd, but such should be expected when using the in-built editor, and some components of the user inferface when in a battle are a little difficult to work with (highlights could be a little difficult to see, and icons in the CTB gauge do not specify which enemy they may represent). I find it easy to overlook such niggles, though, as the rest of the game world is presented very well.\n\nI have yet to complete the game, but I have encountered a few bugs or small mistakes as I have played the game - they are almost always benign, thankfully.\n* In certain cut-scenes, if Lionel has the wound status when other party members are removed, the game may cut to the Game Over screen and force the player to load their previous save.\n* The CTB gauge occasionally gives incorrect information, in one of two ways: a character's turn might not start when it is stated to on the gauge, and enemies might take their turns earlier than suggested. These may be symptoms of the same problem, which I imagine is due to the way the CTB system is implemented.\n* This might not be a bug, but upon learning a new spell when already knowing 8, Marcus forgot one of his previous spells. If this is not a bug, it would be nice to be prompted with a choice upon attempting to learn a move that will cause you to forget an existing one.\n* Some skill descriptions differ when comparing the item form and the learned skill form (debilitating shot).\n* Some of the metal chests appear to be closed after the player has opened them if they leave the screen and re-enter.\n* Some of the sleeping characters change sprite when they are interacted with (they might need to have their direction fixed to prevent this?)\n* Some speech contains spelling mistakes.\n* Upon meeting one of the kings, he describes the Queen to be on his right. She is actually on his left. (I found it quite amusing to imagine him, with his eyes closed, gesturing to empty space while introducing her, and everyone in the room being too afraid to correct him!)\nI stress that these bugs do not irritate me when playing the game - most are harmless, and I list them in the hope that they might aid the developer in identifying and fixing them in future updates.\n\nIn summary, I would recommend this game to anyone who has previously completed a Final Fantasy title and is prepared to play through the first few hours before they are able to connect with the world and its characters. Combat is very much enjoyable preciely because it presents a challenge and is well-balanced (when did you last play an RPG where you felt you had to stock up on potions when you left a village?), and there is a large amount of content available between crossing the land as part of the main quest and completing many side-quests along the way, with the occasional well-written cut-scene to break up the action. While I am not humming the tunes outside of the game they are certainly not boring to listen to and overall the world is well-presented. Previously I had criticised the game quite heavily for having so many good features that were not tied together well due to poor character and story development; now I find I am eating my words as I play further into the game. Well done, Dark Gaia.","July 4, 2014","true","20.1"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","7"

This game is hard enough to be a challenge to even the most hardcore RPG fan.\n\nCons: This game is PUNISHING.  Nearly all fights, even the every few second random battles, are quite hard and cannot be plowed through as in most RPG games.  Your characters are extremly weak early in the game, and require some grinding to strengthen yourself each time you progress to new areas/enemies. Most of the random enemies have some combination of brutal evasion rates, damage type immunities, multiple attacks per round, spellcasting, AND status effects linked to those multiple attacks, and in some cases ALL of the above (Im looking at you Dire Wasps!!!)\nHonestly most of this wouldnt be all that bad, except that you do not get a truly dedicated healer, and must rely mostly on items and "guarding" to regenerate health and mana in combat.  This will FORCE you to spend alot of your time whittling down enemy groups to the last enemy, and then blinding/silencing it so it cannot damage you while you slowly regen your characters up for the next fight.\n\nTips: Save every 2-3 battles in most areas, as the end can come unexpectedly with one unlucky ambush by multiattack enemies.\n\nStock up on status effect cure items at all times.  You will be curing 2-3 times a fight or more against some enemies (Curse you Dire wasps!!!)\n\nDo yourself a favor and read some class guides, the tips therein will save you many tears and much hairpulling.\n\nKeep older weapons around for a while, you never know when that shiney new elemental sword of uberness will be met with a whole area of enemies totally immune to it... sigh.","July 26, 2014","true","34.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Another problem arrises after 1000 years after Lann (Gaia) kills Castoth and it is up to you to save Legionwood once more.\n\nLegionwood 2 is a very difficult game in which requires more planning and quick thinking than traditional RPG games. It offers extensive character customisation, allowing you to choose the class of each character given to you. Legionwood 2 offers non-linear gameplay and gives many optional side quests to explore and conquer as well.\n\nLegionwood 2 has a morality system as well whether you will be hailed as a hero in the end or be dispised by many for your cunning acts. Apart from the morality system, certain actions and decisions and completion of quests would also contribute to the final ending. Simply saying, Legionwood 2 is not a 1 time affair. It has great replay value in that aspect.\n\nIt offers around 21+ hours of gameplay if you are to finish the game once through and it is a fully enjoyable 21 hours of gameplay. For those who would like a very challenging traditional RPG game, this is the game for you! (The battles are very difficult if you do not plan, you have been warned)","November 20, 2014","true","34.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

That battles are hard, and not just click click click.  You have to use defense and well as offensive spells for even the earliest of battles.  It wont let me leave the mine to buy any health potions, or heal my dead character.  Very bad design in not letting me leave the whole mine unless I kill the boss first.  I am at level 9 and last save was when I was level 3.  I am not starting over again.  The developer contacted me yesterday and sent me a new save file, he also said that the next update would fix this problem.  I can now get back to playing, and I am thankful to Steam and dark gaia for listening and fixing my dilemma.","July 7, 2014","true","112.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

This game can be described as "status effects: the game".  Most enemies will bind, blind, sleep, and generally annoy you in every fight.  Your characters will counter with such fiercesome status effects as miss, evade, and no effect, all of which lead you to an untimely grave from the somewhat OP ability for enemies to lay out almost any character in a single turn.  Honestly, this was what the designer intended judging by their other posts, and that is fine, some games aren't for everybody, I get that.  The real reason that I am hanging up the playthrough for this is just that it seems to not generate fun for me.  This game really requires the player to focus on turn order, defense strategies, and many other complex things that just don't seem to fit in to my particular playstyle.  Aside from the mechanics, there are some real positive ideas that went into this design, including the ability to change your class whenever you choose without permanent losses, a dual class system to spice things up, and some sort of moral choice system that I cannot attest to because I'm throwing in the towel early.  The nitpick things about this game are fairly comical from what I've see, they include the sprite possibly changing when you talk to an "idle" character, which another review indicated was a simple missed checkbox in RPGMaker.  A few typos here and there that give a bit of a guffaw.  The biggest detractor aside from the needlessly difficult fights, however, is that these characters suffer from "Dragon Age syndrome" in that they choose to expound the story by murdering your brain with text (says the guy with the long review).  Honestly, after a few minutes into the story, I had no idea what was going on anymore because after my 9-5 I didn't want to read "War and Peace" to start, what is at its core, an RPGMaker game.  To help out potential customers, I will say this: If you love difficult, strategic, thinking mans turn based combat, this should be a good time for you.  If not, I would have to say steer clear.","August 5, 2014","true","5.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","1"

The exception was a set of spiders which seemed entirely luck-based. My chances of hitting them were low, while they could deal either half my healthbar... or about 10%, depending on mood. They also had an attack which would slow my characters to the point where they had 4 moves to my 1.\n\nI didn't even manage to hit them until my third reset - that time they just died easily, as I had better luck.\n\nFrom comments on the forums, this continues, and the only solution is to grind.\n\nPoor programming & resets\n\nI spent three minutes unable to progress because a guard had (randomly) walked into a 1-square-wide corridor and blocked it. Eventually I had to reset the game.\n\nDialogue & story\n\nThe story is potentially interesting, but is ruined by bad writing. I've already witnessed the (cliche) opening tragedy, but due to the writing, it had no impact at all.\n\nConclusion\n\nI'm a fan of old-style RPGs, so I thought this game might be worth a try - now I'm glad I got it cheaply. If you're on the fence about this game, look elsewhere; or check a video first.","June 1, 2014","false","0.5"," 11 of 23 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","11","23","0","1"

Unlike in Skyborn you can't see the monsters - battles occur at random moment and unlike in Deadly Sin 2, you aren't able to 'turn off' monsters respawns, so any kind of walking and/or exploration is tedious as it is continously interrupted by fights. Combat isn't balanced well, at least not in starting areas (first farmland quest), where some of the enemies seem to have much higher abilities than you are.\n\nUnlike in Skyborn or Deadly Sins 2, fight difficulty isn't adjustable at all, which, considering how unfair fights feel, is a big letdown. I don't care about 'old-school nostalgic hard difficulty', I want to be able to play a game as _I_ want it, so having an option of easy difficulty on fights would be much more fun to me. Alas, it is absent.\n\nAs debuffs are expiring so slowly out of combat and as I'm not sure if characters have any sort of health and SP regeneration over time, most of the times I was fighting well under full power and losing over and over again, which was just frustrating. With all battles occuring at random, it is just too much frustration in general with exploration and walking around.\n\nAnd 300+ of money just to resurrect the character after yet another death, _in the city I've saved_, _on a quest_ on behalf of town? Just ridiculous, like those people don't have any sense of gratitude. And as I didn't notice any items that can help with resurrestion while in travels, every time the character is killed it is a track all way back to church - through random, out of blue battles - and all way back into dungeon.  And there is no visible threat management, so monsters seem to attack party members in random.\n\nThe only interesting mechanic thing is a subclass system but it is such a minor detail in a big picture of frustration that I didn't feel it worth my time to shamble through bad unfair-looking combat.\n\nI do appreciate the ability to skip intro, although vanity label with the name of the studio in the beginning of the game can also use some screentime trimming. Also, I don't know if it is a glitch of a feature, but sometimes when you 'talk' to sleeping characters their sprites flip to some other sprites, which would be fun if flipped sprites remained the same - sort of you like peek into their dreams; I found it very amusing. I also liked Aelia portrait (others are ok) but won't it kill developers to maybe make several different emoting portraits so characters won't have same stuck expression all the time?\n\nAs it is at first hour of the game, the writing seems to be uninspired at best (why Clara run to The Hero just to die at his arms when _he knows First Aid spell_ by default)? Although I like that barbarians were given some slight depth in Boudica, instead of 'just evil people out to kill us' label.\n\nConsidering all of this, personally can't recommend.","June 3, 2014","false","1.7"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","4"

If this game was released during the 16 bit generation it would of been held up as one of the great classics of that generation. If you like turn based RPG's, then this is a game for you.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is classic turn-based battles and over world exploration. Basically everything you would expect from an RPG from the 16 bit generation. The game can be difficult at times and require some grinding, I personally had to do very little. The game allows you to change your job/classes to better suit a situation, a lot of times reclasses will be far more effective than grinding.\n\nMusic and sound\nI found the music and sound effects to fit the theme of the game nicely. I am no music aficionado but I can say this, both the music and sound effects kept me immersed in the game world.\n\nGraphics\nThe graphics in this game look similar to the RTP, but they are modified in various ways. I enjoy this better than most of the original graphics styles that popular RPG Maker games try to put out. The RTP graphics are done in the style of classic RPG's and so our these, which is just perfect. The mapping in this game is spot on just like in the first Legionwood. Everything feels natural like it should, trees look like they are growing where trees would naturally grow. No odd ball out of place map items that I can find.\n\nStory\nThe story in Legionwood 2 is its strong suit. Dark Gaia is writer first and a game developer second, and it shows. The story is the focus throughout the game and its enjoyable all the way through. They're are lots of surprises and unexpected events that occur. I don't want to spoil anything, but it doesn't dissapoint. The characters are all unique and you form story opinions about them. Personally Felix is my favorite one, he will come of a little douchy at first but that is what makes him so great. If you like characters that redeem them selves, you will also love Felix. The others are also fantastic in their own right. Lionel is more of your traditional RPG character, but he quickly breaks out of that mold with all the interactions he has with the other characters.\n\n\nLegionwood 2 is glitch free from what I can tell, the game runs very smoothly for me. Don't let my play time fool you, I have played this game via direct download before it was available on Steam. I plan to play this game in its entirety again, thats how good it is. If you are sick of overly hard or overly artsy RPG Maker games give this one a shot. Legionwood 2 is what an RPG Maker game is supposed to be.","June 6, 2014","true","0.1"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

But this game feels extremely rushed and unpolished. I expected more of this game. I'd like to make this review short and to the point so I'll just dive into it.\n\nSTORY\nCompared to the first game this game feels more like a spin-off story than a completed sequel. Although  the storytelling and the writing is very good i still feel that alot more story could had been mashed in there. I cleared the final dungeon at around 12 hours at level 19. This was just after picking up my last party member. For obvious reasons this left me with a feeling that the game was not really complete. One bonus is that there is quiet alot of optional content in the game that provides more story. That's all fine and dandy but personaly i would had liked to see the main story expanded instead. Out of the six main characters only two of them have any time at all to see any real king of character development. With that said the characters are still very well written and atleast a couple of them are genuinly likeable.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nThe gameplay is solid but nothing out of the ordinary. The battles are hard at times and can be quiet annoying but the game offers loads of different ways to tackle them. You can for example play a battle slowly with one heavy damage character and three Clerics if that floats your boat. The upside to the difficulty is that i found myself satisfied when i defeated certain bosses. Battles aside the puzzles are mostly frustrating and kinda feel placed in the game to expand the playtime.\n\nGRAPHICS\nI like DarkGaias mapping alot. I really feel that he makes the most out of the built in Graphics in every RPG Maker engine. He has a real knack for making all areas feel unique and full of life.\n\nMUSIC\nSome really good choises here. I especially like the fantastic battle music from NemesisTheory. There is not much to say about this really. The soundtrack as a whole does it's job well and provides even more atmosphere to the areas and battles of the game.\n\nMINOR POINTS\nThere are some bugs in the game. It's one of the things that makes the game feel rushed. Overall it's nothing game breaking though and it does not really lower the overall experience that much.\n\nOVERALL\nThe game is still worth the price in my opinion. You get 10-15 hours of really solid old-school gameplay out of it. But you better be sure that you enjoy the SNES era of JRPGs because this game is not for everyone.\n","November 25, 2015","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
