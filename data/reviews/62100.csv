At first glance I thought it was someone trying to recreate Tetris, but I was way wrong. My one fart about it is the Steam version is not as fun as the PS3 Deluxe version.

This game is a love letter to Q Entertainment. (Because its not made by them)\n\nChime is a block dropping game in which not quite Tetris pieces are randomly given to you to place onto the board. The main goal is to create quadrilaterals using the slightly unfamiliar pieces. I should mention the blocks do not actually “drop” You can place them anywhere on the board and as such the possibilities are greater so the game demands your combos and coverage to be better than traditional “falling” block games.\n\nThis game takes from Lumines more than the others. You build quadrilaterals and then a timer starts until it becomes solid in which you must add to it before solidification for more points and combo scores. Once solid, a bar that sweeps the screen collects the solid stuff you have made. And this continues until you have amassed enough to unlock the next stage. Its unfortunate that even in free mode you cannot even preview what the next stages song will be as unlocking new stages requires play in the timed mode.\n\nThe reason I say it borrows from those games is because of how the gameplay is integrated into the music. The more elaborate the combos the more flare is added to the music; and the music is phenomenal.\n\nTHE GIST\nI was pretty big into Lumines back during the days of the original PSP. And this game captures some of that original feeling. By that I mean a good but new sort of puzzle game that is not exactly Tetris or in this case not exactly Lumines.","February 17","true","2.5"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

But it is more flexible. The pieces are shaped out of five squares. You have to build bigger blocks with them. There are six levels with different combinations of shapes. Music is part of the experience. It changes due to your progress. But it's still the same track. This could be annoying if you play Chime too much. In that case you can mute the music. There is some kind of mouse lag which depends on the level. Sometimes when you have no time this could be frustrating. But most of the time it is not. Nevertheless Chime is still a great game.

Very nicely polished, very clean and colourful presentation and pleasant syncing of the music with the placed pieces.

Understandably there's no easy way to fix that.\n\nThe pace of the gameplay can be quite demanding on the player.

You'd clear the board and score points when you build up 2x2 blocks of the same colour, when a line would slide across the screen and take them out.\n\nIn Chime, you don't need to worry about colour, but the pieces are all different configurations of 5 squares connected, much like tetris' 4 squares. You can move, rotate, and place them anywhere on the grid. The 'beatline' will move in time with the music, setting off events when it hits the shapes. If you have a solid blocks of 3x3 or more, they will disappear after a short while, give better music samples, and stamped down a completed section on the grid. The aim is to get 100% coverage on these grids before the time runs out.\n\nThis game is great if you want to fill in time, or if you're into mixing a few tunes with samples based on how well you play. Probably a small cult following for that. In the end, since there are only 6 or 7 level/songs to play, it only becomes a grind to try to get 100% coverage on each level, not really much more than that.\n\nPretty good if on sale, not really something to put in a wishlist though.\n\n6/10","September 1, 2014","true","5.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I prefer the first game because of For Silence that I discovered there.\n\nChime is a puzzle game where the music plays a role. Let me copy/paste what I've written for the sequel.\n\nYou have to cover a surface with blocks, so that a "quad" (generally when you have at least 3x3) can be formed and expanded. Once it's over, the quad disappear during the next passage of the beat, letting parts of the blocks used on the grid. And after a moment, they'll glow if unused and you'll loose the multiplier and the unused stuff.\n\nHere, you have a free mode and a timed mode. You have also achievements, some of them are challenging.\n\nFor the Steam Edition, you have also Still Alive from Portal. It's because of that song that I bought Chime and got hooked on For Silence.\n\nThe best is to try the game, because surely, while I can explain it with my memory, you'll be better to buy it and play. 4 euros isn't expensive at all for the game.","November 19, 2010","true","64.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","2"

Chime is, deep down, basically the same game. You move blocks around creating larger blocks and when the beat kicks in you get points. The trick is, of course, to create as many blocks as possible to gain a big score. The levels are not rectangular like in Lumines, but they have several different shapes. It can be challenging. But fun at the same time though.\nSo if you like puzzles, music or a combination of these two then Chime is your game.\n\n[Rating: 70/100]","December 26, 2011","true","0.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

You can be as casual or as arcade about the game as you like. It is a good amount of fun for about an hour, allowing replayability with high scores, setting personal goals like clearing the level 3 times before you time out, or even just trying to get the best sounding result. Unfortunately it's hard to find direction in this game without coming up wiht it yourself.\n\nIt is unfortunate how there are only 6 songs. If there were 10 songs I'd be satisfied. If there were 30 songs I would buy multiple copies for my friends so we could compete. I understand that this was a game linked to a charity, and there was likely a budget (or a deadline) that had to be kept, but it's really not enough to justify the game on its own for its price. It really is a nice game with lots of potential. Had there been a custom song feature (even if it allowed a maximum of 2 minutes with any custom song) I would've played this game for hours on end.\n\nThis is a nice game to get gifted, on sale, or with a coupon, but not for it's entirety of it's price. However, I am very excited for Chime 2 which should be coming out soon, featuring many more songs, levels, and modes. I would reccomend saving your money for the sequel instead of this game. I would consider this game better as an extention to the sequel, but on it's own it's simply not enough.","February 7, 2014","false","7.5"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","5","12","0","0"

The singular power of so beautiful a portent impressed me into the service of such a wondrous outcome, and I spent the next two years building a pyramid of pure white limestone to house what would eventually be the greatness of this game I had envisioned.\n\nAt some point the developers of Chime must have talked with my dealer and smoked the same stuff because I was like, 15% done with the pyramid when this game came out.

There.\n\nThis puzzle game has a much bigger emphasis on music, without simply applying graphics to a beat - your choice of location and shape of pieces can affect the song's rythm, style and beat, making the audio in each game somewhat unique. The setlist features music by Philip Glass, Orbital, Lemon Jelly and others, and moves from haunting to beautiful to lively, as the playing field and shapes change,\n\nBuild larger sets of shapes for a bigger bonus, and try to cover the level 100% in pieces to win, but the count doesn't stop at 100%, or even 200% - so keep trying.\n\nAn absolute must for puzzle nuts with quick minds and fingers who don't want an awful loop playing in the background while they perfect their mental artform.

The objective is simple, fill the game grid with various shapes and hope you get the next round, although nothing changes, it gets better with the music pace and how it plays, therefore, an excellent edition to any music lovers collection.\n\nNothing to say about Graphics, since its a simple game and well, controls are simple too, no problem for anyone to pick this up. That simple. Its all about the music, you, your concentration and the passion to achieve past the 100% game grid.\n\nA high recomendation from me, a must buy at any rate, if you want to sit and lounge to some deep beats.\n\n4.5 / 5","January 21, 2011","true","9.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spindor/recommended/62100/","Spindor","Spindor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spindor/","1003 products in account","Chime, it's a 2D puzzle game that will have you trying to fit these 5-square jigsaw pieces onto a platform to complete rectangles. The bigger the rectangle, the bigger the score. When the time runs out, you're done. Except you're not, because Chime will keep sucking you in by making you think that you could have done just that little bit better.\n\nEven though there are only 6 different levels and 3 different difficulties in this game, I found myself replaying them repeatedly. Always thinking that I could beat my previous score if I just concentrated, if I just cut out the mistakes, if I moved just a little bit faster. The friend leaderboards (the global leaderboards are annoyingly topped with cheats) will drive you to try again as you curse that friend who seemingly has an impossible score.\n\nTo give you even more encouragement, a special thing happens when you get full coverage on the board. The game gives you a points and time bonus, wipes the boards, and gets you to go again. Your completion percentage is tracked with your high scores so you will always be using this to drive your next attempt. Knowing that you got 5 completions last time, surely this time you'll be able to get 6?\n\nSo it's addictive, good. But then there's the music. Provided by some great electronic music artists (like Lemon Jelly and Moby), the music is the backbone of this game. The music is synced to the puzzle board so that beats match a swiper going across the board. When you have a completed rectangle on the board, the shape of the rectangle will trigger a different layer of the music track to be heard. It feels like you are building the track up as you progress through the level. It builds on your sense of accomplishment as you play and it really does put the icing on this rectangled shaped cake.\n\nIf you are a puzzle game player and a fan of electronic music, this game is a must-have. The only disappointment you'll have is that there are only 6 tracks (one more than the XBox version thanks to Portal's Still Alive track being added for PC). But don't be surprised if you wake up one day to find you've spent dozens of hours on this game, trying to score that perfect run.","November 27, 2013","true","124.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Chime would be the result.\n\nYou have various block shapes and you have to piece them together until they disappear from the board. Simple enough right? Well, it's not as simple as "fill up a row and it disappears".\n\nYou have to form rectangular areas of 3x3 or larger called "Quads". Making a quad marks off that part of the board as "finished", and the ultimate goal is to finish as much territory on a board as possible (50% or higher to get to the next level).\n\nThis alone would be an interesting concept, but they coupled it with Music. As you put pieces down, a "beat" line goes across the board in time to the music. Each piece sounds off a different note, and each quad sounds off a different sound bite from a song. The resulting music can be quite beautiful.\n\nA good sign that this is a worthy puzzle game is the fact that on my first time playing it, I played for almost 2 hours before I realized time had passed.","November 20, 2010","true","31.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the price that I paid, it was definitely worth it. A combination of tetris and music genre games. The aim of the game is to create quads, simple as that. When a quad is formed it will then take some time to solidify. During this period you can keep making the quad bigger and bigger to get more points. When you first play it, you will have little clue how to score big points. For example, it took me a while to work out you can stack shapes on top of the "cleared" space. Is it worth it? For $5 you only get 6 levels but it's a game that is replayable. Oh and if you do purchase, part of the profits go to charity apparently.","December 14, 2010","true","3.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game only has 6 music tracks, so basically 6 levels to play, but yes: a highscore system. While I certainly tried to beat my own scores a lot, the funny thing is: these levels can indeed be fun over and over, as long as you stop playing it with the originally intended music at some point. Because of the lack of more levels I just replayed the ones available a whole lot with my own music library playing in the back and I keep coming back to this little game every once in a while. The original tracks are great though! They're just tiring when you play the game as much as I did. I really wish Chime had more levels.

It can also be fun to see if you can do better than your Steam friends as the game provides various ways of comparing scores and times.\nCons: There are only 6 songs. You'll likely tire of them after a while and want to move on to a new game. There's a Chime Super Deluxe being released exclusively for PS3 that includes new music, co-op and versus modes, though.

"Easy" mode is to start the clock with 9 minutes - which, for a while, you're going to need in order to beat the level - which means you get to listen to at least 9 minutes of pretty much the same thing. Not much changes from level to level, so it's not something you'd want to sit down and play for a long time.\n\nHowever, it's not a bad concept, and the first 5-10 minutes of each song CAN be pretty cool as you discover the different sounds that the shapes can make.

Each level is considered a song, and each song has a beat which marches across the level as you fill the blank space with Tetris-like blocks. When you fill up at least a 3x3 space (called a Quad), it starts to fill and gives points. You can add to it while it fills, but once it's filled it's done. When the beat bar marches past, the Quad is added to the amount of space filled. 50% fill gives you access to the next level. It's a difficult game to describe, but if you like Tetris, Qix and Music, you really can't go wrong.","December 30, 2010","true","2.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Its a mixture between tetris and volfied. Use tetris style blocks and arrange them to enable capture coverage of an area. The bigger the area you cover, the better your score will be.\n\nThere are a total of 6 stages which can be completed in either timed or free mode. Timed mode basically sets a time in which to complete the stage, and of course more coverage also means more time added. If you manage to to do it, free mode will then be unlocked for you to enjoy the stage at your leisure with no time limit.\n\nThe game is simple and relaxing to play. The music is a good eclectic mix of smooth electronica tunes which are actually composed by real life music artistes such as Moby or Orbital. Tis a bit of a shame that there are only 6 stages available for play.\n\nOverall Rating: 7.0 / 10\nProbably not worth to buy at full price, but still worth a look if its on sale and if you are looking for a nice relaxing musical tetris like game.","July 19, 2012","true","3.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For the price that I paid, it was definitely worth it. A combination of tetris and music genre games. The aim of the game is to create quads, simple as that. When a quad is formed it will then take some time to solidify. During this period you can keep making the quad bigger and bigger to get more points. When you first play it, you will have little clue how to score big points. For example, it took me a while to work out you can stack shapes on top of the "cleared" space. Is it worth it? For $5 you only get 6 levels but it's a game that is replayable.

There's a timed mode so you won't stick to one game for hours on end. The soundtracks are nice and the controls are mostly just the two mouse buttons.\n\nOnly to those prone to getting addicted to arcade games it's high risk ;-)\nLike tetris?

Paying attention to creating non-fragment groups is thee most importat adivce I can give. One you have too many fragments you will surely not be able to make it. The key would be to start small and build large to stack that multiplier up high and get massive points before the time runs out. This is all about skill placement and also being able to use the entire board to clear it.\n\nDon't pay attention to neg reviews, if you like skill puzzles this is for you!
