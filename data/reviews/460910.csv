At the time I write this, you have the choice of playing one of two characters, Emma or Shean, who play the same. There isn’t too much of a story to the game, though each level has their own objective that offers some bit of a story if you’re interested. The game currently only has two episodes with five levels each but more are promised to come.\n\nGameplayYou can play the game with either a game controller or your keyboard and mouse. You can also play alone or with a friend locally. The game is pretty simple, you walk around and shoot down enemies and objects while clearing mission objectives and making it to the end of a level. There are a variety of guns to be used, or you can use a knife. You also have grenades which I found extremely useful as well dynamite to do heavy duty damage. A noted feature is that you can aim your gun 360 degrees, apparently before this update you could only aim in four directions though I haven’t played it that way.\n\nGraphics/AudioThe game is fully pixelated so don’t expect too much in the graphics department. You can choose from two outfit choices for your character.  Like the choice of characters, this is solely cosmetic and their tiny pixels make it hard to see the clothes. However, I did like the retro feel of the graphics, while nothing fancy they still look good with nice colors and great locations. The music is also decent though not too memorable. It’s some basic rough sounding combat music so the tunes do fit the stages while you run around shooting baddies.\n\n\nPros+ Great retro feel.\n+ A variety of weapons to choose from.\n+ Great to play with a friend.\n+ Three levels of difficulty.\n+ Each level gets increasingly longer adding new challenges.\n+ Steam achievements and trading cards.\n\nCons\n- Though you can play solo, it’s harder and not as enjoyable as playing with someone else.\n- Currently the price does not match the amount of content the game offers.\n\nFinal ThoughtsI hope to see more from A-Gents, I enjoyed playing this game and have hopes that it will keep getting better since the developers do interact with the community. I hope the project is completed and recommend this game.  If you’re unsure about investing quite yet then keep an eye out for further updates to the game. I feel that when all the episodes are released that it will be even more fun.\n\n\nRating: 8.5/10\n\nThis review was submitted for Elite Giveaways, check us out for more reviews ranging from Indie games to AAA games to F2P games.","May 4","true","10.3"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","17","19","0","0"

As of April 24, 2016 there are only 2 of 6 episodes completed, and each episode has 5 levels.  Plus Easy, Normal, and Hard modes.  Okay the first thing everyone needs to know is my son corrected me and told me this was a top down shooter and not a first person shooter.  I do play FPSs, ones like Borderlands which I die a lot in and am not very good at.  I even play Team Fortress 2 just for fun. I am not very good at that either.  My son however plays games like Borderlands, Dark Souls and Dark Siders, screams a lot at the computer but claims he enjoys them.  Now that everyone has a basic understanding of the extreme gulf in ability and game knowledge between my son and I, I will get on with the story.\n\nI am playing A-Gents because a kind person from Phime Studios sent me a key and it looked like something I could actually play.  So I am giggling away and laughing while I am trying to play this game.  It is actually pretty easy to play, even I get the controls, which probably means they are really, really simple.  However, I do die a lot because well I simply am not quite coordinated enough to turn and shoot at the same time without practice on a controller.  Now my son starts wondering why I am laughing and saying "Darn it" and "Shoot" a lot.  So he wanders into my room and asks what I am playing.  So I tell him.  He says to me, "I don't play top downs because I don't like them, and I don't like Indie games because they are dumb."  Then he promptly takes the controller away from me and plays for the next hour while I just watch.  I do not say a word.   He finishes some level lightly tosses the controller back and shrugs.  "Have fun," he says as he leaves to go back to shouting at Dark Souls.  I found the entire scenerio extremely funny.\n\nAnyway I like the game, and as far as gameplay goes someone with far more knowledge will have talk about that.","April 24","true","7.2"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","11","16","4","0"

Its basically like a twin stick cannon fodder.

READ MY EDIT BELOW THIS PARAGRAPH!\nThis game is really fun. It is nice and retro-style the way I like it. It's so addicting, and it is soooooo fun! Oh my gosh it is so fun. Now, you may be wondering why I gave this a negative review when you just read how I love the game. It is because of one thing that actually makes me not able to play this game to be honest. The aiming is 4 directional. It honestly ruins the game... like to the point where I am actually probably not going to play this unless they add 8 directional aiming. I absolutely hate it and it ruins the game. If people like 4 directional aiming thats fine... then maybe they could just add like a toggle in the controls settings where you could switch between 4 directional aiming or if you want 8 directional adding. Just please add 8 directional aiming. I honestly can not play the game without it. Thank you.\n\nIMPORTANT EDIT: They added 360 aiming. Let's go! Thank you! Game is A++++++ now. I switch my review from negative to positive. Thanks!","April 20","true","1.2"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","6"

The game has a variety of weapons can be used, such as assault rifles, grenades, explosives, knives variety of weapons to choose from.\n\nThe game has many tasks can be carried out, task of the game in some houses there are hostages, and you can use dynamite to blast the house, to rescue the hostages really great success. In particular task, you can in the helicopter use submachine gun fire, really feel great.\n\nThis is a pixel action and shooting game, the operation is very easy to use.

But I don't want to be Dr Spoiler more than I have to  :)\nThere are 10 levels, split in two episodes, and developers promised up to six episodes.\nThe hand grenades are the strangest thing so far, they bounce off anything, you can throw them over trees, shoot them away, so they are very useful, but also very unpredictable.\nSome things in menu (especially level select and briefing) could be designed better, because they are a bit "technical" comparing to the rest of the game design which is vibrant and colorful.\nOverall 7.5-8 out of 10 (depending on future levels and updates).","April 24","true","0.5"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"
