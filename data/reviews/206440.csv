Borrowing elements from films such as Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and Pixar's Up, this is the story of a man on his deathbed attempting to fulfil his lifelong dream to visit the moon.\n\nTo go into anymore detail and risk spoilers would be a crime, but know that To The Moon stands as one of the most heartfelt stories of any game I have ever played, and when paired with the immaculate score composed by my much beloved Laura Shigihara, I can hardly imagine how someone could play through it without feeling something.\n\nIt's worth noting that what is here consists almost entirely of exposition. This is in by no means a slight against the game, just a fact that needs to be mentioned so you know what you are getting into. I realize that many have a disdain for games that barely warrant being described as such, but in this case I beg that they put aside those prejudices, as I feel if anything could change their minds To The Moon is it.\n\nTo say that Freebird Games creation was emotionally affecting to me would be an understatement. Despite coming close on many occasions, I can scarcely recall any game that managed to make me tear up the way To The Moon did. It's a remarkable achievement in not only videogame storytelling, but as a narrative in any medium, and you would be an absolute fool if you passed it up!\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","October 25, 2013","true","5.0"," 537 of 575 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","537","575","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jet-Black/recommended/206440/","Jet-Black","Jet Black","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jet-Black/","517 products in account","Wow.\n\nTo be brutally honest, I loaded this game up today thinking that I would just play around for a few minutes and then put it away, unlikely to ever play it again. In reality, from the point the story began to unfold I decided that I wouldn't ... or couldn't stop until it was completed.\n\nIt's amazing what Freebird Games managed to do with the RPG Maker tool. With some subtle animations, lighting, and movement, it didn't take long for me to forget the 'low budget' visuals and imagine as the game and story elements unfolded in whatever resolution my mind can create.\n\nI will admit that this isn't what a person could call a gameplay heavy experience. However, the way that the elements are woven into the story are creative and even add to the story. I think as a medium we hurt ourselves by calling our games 'games' at all... however, I was able to complete the journey through my own interaction with enough perceived freedom that I didn't feel corralled into a corner. Mostly the story itself made me want to push to the next story element or conclusion... it was simply that good.\n\nIt's sad, really, that a small time developer like Freebird can craft something with such a small budget that is so moving, yet all the big AAA developers can hardly bring me to laugh let alone shed a tear. Speaking of laughter, the pacing of the story is impressive with some comic relief to mix up the joy and sadness. Although I will admit, a few times I thought one of the main characters was a little over-the-top silly... but that may just well be who he is.\n\nWhen I was in college I took a movie class where the instructor said it was a travesty to ever watch a movie in pieces... and in this case, if you can free up a few hours, I think that this dish is best served in one sitting. Just keep a box of tissue next to your monitor.","January 4, 2014","true","4.2"," 369 of 383 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","369","383","0","0"

Steam user reviews are also "overwhelmingly positive" (97% positive out of nearly 12.000 reviews is really impressive). That's already quite an achievement by itself, as it was the first game made by the then new and really small development studio "Freebird Games". So I went into this game with quite some expectations, and I am very happy they were all fulfilled, and more.\n\nTo put it frankly: as a game that wants to tell an original, emotionally involving story, To the Moon is simply among the very, very best. Its story is so original, so gripping and so sad at some points, that I found myself completely absorbed by it, and I played through the entire game in one day and almost in a single go. That's no exceptional feat: it's not very long, I needed just under six hours to reach the end. But what wonderful six hours these were! Since To the Moon relies for more than 90% on its story and its twists and turns, I won't spoil anything here. Suffice it to say that I felt involved in a way that a good book or a good movie can achieve -and maybe even more.\n\nIt's not only the story that is gripping, there is more to it. To the Moon dwells extensively on very important social and philosophical questions, such as the desire to develop one's individuality amid a rather bland society, or man's right to decide (or not) on his own life's ending. Heavy and even depressing as this may sound, in reality the game succeeds wonderfully in touching these delicate issues in a subtle way, made all the more digestible by its great use of humour. I found myself quite often laughing aloud, only to feel tears coming up the next minute or so. It's this so difficult to achieve balance between humour and depth, that makes this game outstanding and a true piece of art. Dialogues, of which there are plenty, are simply masterful: all credits to the story- and copy-writers for this one.\n\nNot everything is perfect, though: the actual gameplay is rather bland and even repetitive, since it mostly involves moving the two playable characters around on a small map and interacting with objcets and other persons in a rather straightforward point-and-click adventure-syle. Happily, the inventory is kept very simple, but there are is a whole series of mini- (even micro-) games that is simply boring. But even this rather disappointing gameplay vanishes into nothing thanks to the story and the emotions it evokes. The subtle 16-bit graphics are quite interesting: even though heavily pixelated, they manage to bring across quite some detail, even on an emotional level.\n\nAll in all, this is a gem of a game; a testimony to the fact that Indie-games have evolved into gamings most innovative department, where content is so much more important than package. It's a must-have for anyone who takes his gaming even a tiny bit serious.\n\nOverall score: 9.5/10","January 2, 2015","true","5.3"," 179 of 188 people (95%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","95","179","188","5","4"

Wonder if, every day, there is a time and place for every action you do, every step you make, and sometimes you ask: Is it really worth it? I think like this a lot. Every action that goes on feels so insignificant. Yet, I got the chance to escape from a cruel world, in a world of hope, dreams, sorrow and..reality. With the help of a masterpiece, known as To The Moon, a critically acclaimed indie title released by FreebirdGames.\n\nThere are no words to describe this game. You might say it's beautiful, it's touching, amazing, inspiring, hopeful; and, yet, all of those would be true. But one cannot describe in sheer vocalized form what a journey this game takes an individual through. The game may be short, but it is an indescribable adventure through the memories and mind of John, exploring a beautiful, charming and, well, real world of memories he has. This game has so much charm, so much utter personallity, that it could rightfully be considered just one of the most beautiful masterpieces created in gaming. The music is awe-inspiring, the graphics charming and detailed, the characters, memorable and loveable..I don't think there could be a single thing to entail about this game in a negative light.\n\nWe, as gamers, often look at the things we play in electronics as, well, just games. They have plots, controls, gameplay, multiplayer, and aspects to look at. To The Moon is not like that. It's not a game. It's a story. Never, once, did I even consider this a game. It was something so beyond my grasp, something so beyond anyone's grasp of stories, that it genuinely brings a tear to the eye. Sure, there may be only 5-6 hours of gameplay, but every minute is a moment in this game. Every second brings something memorable and loveable for the player to enjoy, a sense of wonder and immersion that no game can truly offer like this one..\nHonestly, I went into this game with low expectations. When I first heard about it, I scoffed. 'A game about going to the moon? What could that possibly entail?'. I later heard more about the game, watching the trailer and hearing about it from a very special, close friend of mine. As a birthday present, I received this game, and completed it the same day. It was an unforgettable trip. I could recommend anyone to this game and have no regrets what so ever.\n\nThank you, for taking me on this journey, my love.\nIt is one no one should be without.","June 17, 2014","true","4.0"," 192 of 209 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","192","209","0","10"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/recommended/206440/","Jadarma","Jadarma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Jadarma/","267 products in account","OverviewTo the Moon is not so much a game as a story driven interactive narrative. The gameplay is minimal and it mainly consists of moving around, but once you get into the story, believe me, you won't give a s#!t. This is an absolutely AMAZING game that will make you both laugh and cry. Words cannot describe my experience with it. Just... Just play it.\n\nThe Pros:Amazing Story - I will not spoil any details about the story, but I will vouch for it's quality. You play as a pair of scientists who work for a sort of "Make a Wish" foundation, but which use an Animus-like machine to enter peoples memories and alter them in order to grant the dying person's wish. The story is divided into three acts, and takes about 4 hours to naturally progress through. Some may argue the story elements are a bit cliche, but frankly it was so well executed and related that I cannot say that bothered me. Also, great piece of advice from me: Pay close attention to everything. Even something that might not seem relevant will prove to be a foreshadowing of a greater truth. It's worth it to pay close attention to surroundings, dialogues, scenery, anything and everything.\n\nGreat Characters - The characters' personality is well defined, and you will grow to like them, especially Dr. Neil Watts, one of the controllable characters, who is the comic relief of the story and does a great job. But in all seriousness, everything is so amazing about this story.\n\nAmazing Music - If anyone says music in gaming doesn't impact on experience they have obviously not played this game. The music is absolutely amazing and only hearing different tracks can put you in a different mood. You can go from happy to sad to worried to sad in a few minutes.\n\nBeautiful Pixel Art - The game's retro RPG style graphics is a strong point in my opinion. It makes you concentrate more on the story. Anyways, the environment is beautiful, lighting is superb and I've never admired a pixel graphics game with such attention thus far.\n\nFree DLC! - So far there were two mini episodes released which you can download and play for free! Also, the OST, which is paid, apart from being beautiful, offers 50% of the profits to charity. This is DLC done right.\nThe Cons:Resolution - This isn't about graphics, and you won't even notice, as the game really sucks you in like a good book, but I was having problems opening up the game, and instead of upscaling to full HD, the game resorts to a very tiny resolution that might cause issues to some. Also, it's 4:3, and you'll see black bars. This is most likely because of the game engine they used.\n\nIt ends. - At some points i couldn't wait for the story to go on so I can see what happens, and at the end I wish it didn't because I was just sobbing at the ending. Amazing.\nConclusionThis game is an excellent visual narration, and I recommend it to anyone wanting to read a great story in a great manner. The Overwhelmingly Positive reviews are truly deserved. Also gift this to people who play tough, and see if they cry at the end. I was surprised I did.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more of my recommended games, you can view my reviews here, and be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group\n\nIf you enjoyed this review and want to see more of my work, consider joining my group and follow my curator page!

I've always thought they were lighthouses."\n\nThere are odd, mismatching anecdotes in everybody’s life that would not absolutely mean a thing for anyone else beside a handful of people. Like an old, tattered soccer ball, an origami rabbit figure or an ugly platypus plushy... Here in this heartwarming narrative story, we are given the chance to acknowledge the sentiment hidden behind the oddity: a story of love, loss and a promise that would make a grown man shed a tear or two.\n\nIt was the middle of a storm shaken night when esteemed doctors Eva Rosalene and Neill Watts arrived on the address given to them. They argued a bit among each other - about whose fault it would be the company car getting crashed on a tree - and took off, hurrying towards the house on the cliff. They heard the lingering song resounding from a piano as they get in. Lily, the caretaker of the old man welcomed them in and asked them nervously as she was leading them towards their client: "If you wouldn't take my question the wrong way, what would be your business exactly?” Neill answered the question with a wide grin on his face before Eva had the time to say anything: "We grant wishes!” The caretaker was a bit startled by the unexpected answer, but didn't push for any more explanation. This time Eva directed the anticipated question: "What was his last wish?” Lily took a pause just long enough to catch her breath while opening the door to the master bedroom where a doctor was in attending to observe the patient's vitals, then answered: "He wanted to go to the moon..."\n\nTo the Moon is a wondrous little story about an old man and his enigmatic dying wish. Thousands of anecdotes, daily items, far forgotten dialogues and faces that belonged to a life past brought together paints a picture that you wouldn't soon forget. Ever watched Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind? Well, it's that kind of experience, plus some sense of humor inclined to be either absurd or noir, and minus Jim Carrey. It is cheesy, it is sensual, and it is heart wreckingly realistic and... It is a modern fairytale.\n\nI mostly agree that beauty lies in simplicity. To the Moon seems to be proof enough with 16 bit RPGMaker graphics, a handful of beautiful piano songs and cartoonish figures moving around with near comical animations, yet still with powerful enough narrative and screenplay that would result in making a grown woman like me cry. I've seen Hollywood sob stories with lesser creative spark and elegance in narration compared to this one. It is weaved with odes, references and commemorations that would bring faint smiles to your face; sometimes with bitterness, sometimes with warmth.\n\nThere is arguably no gameplay aside walking around and collecting some items - and solving a folding puzzle now and then - thus, the game can either be categorized as a minimalistic adventure or a visual novel with puzzle elements altogether. For the fair warning, it certainly is not an RPG. Knowing whatever you are getting yourselves into, To the Moon is a welcome experience of 4-5 hours.\n\nFor me, it was worth every single second I spared. There are the kind of games that you'd wish you forget about, just so you can experience them for the first time all over again. This is one of them.\n\nPlease also check out Lady Storyteller's Curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","January 28","true","8.8"," 128 of 131 people (98%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","98","128","131","3","9"

To the Moon introduces the idea of having the possibility to rewrite your life in order to be content with it during you last concious moments on this planet, but  also presents you with the costs of doing so.\nBesides having a filosofically interesting plot, this game features tonnes of little jokes and references that will keep the enjoyment up to scratch right from the start, all the way through the game, always knowing when it's appropriate to be funny.\nThis story is nicely accompanied by a lovely soundtrack that deserves to be picked up and having a listen to. Unless, of course, you have an intrinsic hate of piano music. The tracks are composed in such a way that they fit the individual scenes perfectly and add a genuine extra layer to the storytelling.\nPlaying this game for anything than its, frankly magnificent, storytelling capabilities would be a mistake though.

Along the way of recovering Johnny's memory a wonderful story of love, and loss unfolds before your eyes..\n\nThis game is very good, it tells an amazing story, which if you enjoy stories, you'll love, if you are the pew pew pew, kill enemies, collect loot, gain levels type of guy, you should stay far away from this.\n\nThe game will last about 2 hours give or take a few minutes for solving the puzzles.  The ending will bring out the feelings in even the most hardened gamer.  Although as good as the story is, it can be pretty predicatable, although that isn't really a bad thing..\n\nI'd recommend this game highly, great story, great music, and generally enjoyable enough..","November 21, 2015","true","6.8"," 85 of 94 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","85","94","4","0"

It made me feel as if true love no matter the obstacles or hardships you may face, it is worth tackling them together. Sometimes one may make sacrifices that others may not understand, not even the one they might of been intended for but its always for a dream.\n\nLove is such a big word and can be expressed in many forms. The story really felt almost like a novella (soap opera)\nOne moment they are jerking your tears, the next you are smiling and that is what made it more interesting to continue playing. The twist in this game were on point and with some patience it really pays off to follow the game through the ending.

After a roadkill and a car crash, the two doctors arrive at their latest client's abode. An abandoned lighthouse, a large house with a sick man and his maid and grasslands with animals around is what the doctors find. But when they ask for Mr. John Wyles's dying wish, they get - "He wants to go to the moon."\n\nTo The Moon's strong assets :-\nA perfectly executed beautiful story which you'll play time and again.\nSimplistic gameplay.\nEnchanting music which keeps hold of you for a time long enough.\nSceneries embellished by 16 bit graphics.\nWell scripted dialogues making you laugh and heartfelt at the same time.\nAdorning the atmosphere are the strongly developed characters.\nA spellbinding lasting appeal.\n"What if you forget or get lost?"\n"Then we can always regroup on the moon, silly!"\n\nNow I've to reciprocate - there was not a single aspect of the game that curbed or strifled the flow of execution in any manner except its short length. It was what you call - near perfection.\n\nTo The Moon isn't just a story, it is not just a form of media. It is an experience.\nYou cannot just play the game and forget that you ever did, it gives you an escapade which will accompany you for the best part of your life. To the Moon is peerless and unparalleled.

There is very little gameplay to be had, the 'game' is about the journey you go on, slowly going back through John's life piecing things together.\n\nI was warned that I would be in tears playing this, and there was a little part early on that got me blubbering, perhaps because it hit a little too close to home in that circumstance. As I approached the end of the story, I was ready and waiting for the part that would hit my emotions, as I had been told the ending was quite a tear-jerker.

The soundtrack is superb, it evokes a lot of emotion. I personally find it important to have a good soundtrack let alone a great story. I loved the way they progressed through the story backwards and still successfully made the game play out smoothly. I wouldn't suggest buying this game if you're purchasing games for gameplay or graphics. To the Moon is basically a story but you have to push buttons to read it. When I first began the game, I had a mindset where I believed the story was going to be linear, predictable. But I was wrong! I found myself wanting to know more, because a lot is left out and told to you later. I didn't think the game was "too short," I thought it was perfect. Just like watching a movie.\n\nGranting a bed ridden elderly person's wish through altering his memory. Interesting.

To the Moon is a game where the story is clearly the winner and it’s the reason why everyone should spend their time playing it. I’ll start by saying that it may not be a game that will please most of the players but consider starting the game with an open heart and the experience will be a remarkable one. The two main characters are doctors who go by the name of Watts and Rosalene and their jobs can be many things, but common isn’t one of them. They can provide an alternative, a different path to the ones whose life is approaching the end. During the story, your role is to help your patient to fulfil his wish: going to the moon. While it may seem an odd thing to wish for, there may be a reason for it, but that, is up to you to find out.\n\nYou start by going from the most recent memories to the older ones, until you reach the point where you may find key-points in the Johnny’s past. But as you advance in the game you start to create a bond to his memories which can be odd, considering it’s just a job and Johnny is a stranger for you, but remember, if you let yourself immerse into the story you will end playing a much better game this way. There’s not much to be said about the Story itself without spoiling most of it to be honest. The game is very straight to the point, hence its short length but this can be a good thing because there won’t be any unnecessary time spent doing pointless quests or wandering off for long. You have a goal, this is your job and emotions should be left aside, but play this game as intended and emotions will surely make part of this experience. As they should.\n\nThe music/soundtrack is as much important as the story because during certain events you will be listening to a nice piano tune that will provide warm feelings or a sense of loss, sadness and curiosity. I don’t believe the game to be any sort of depressing, as humor also plays an important role in To the Moon. Small conversations with some jokes and jests will arise from time to time to create a lighter mood since, after all, this is your goal and you shouldn’t let your personal feelings obstruct your intents. While I’m sure many will leave satisfied with the story (weather you end up liking the very end or not) and the music as well, do not come expecting some heavy gameplay mechanics or a rather lengthy game. I believe its short size can be a strong point this time because it takes you right where you need to be so I would advise to not measure your time and money invested with the length of the game but rather in its storytelling. If you are able to past the simple visuals with almost no gameplay mechanics, and if you let yourself engage in the Story while listening to the wonderful soundtrack then To the Moon will be a perfect fit to play in the between of any other lengthier games you are currently playing. It’s a respectable violence-free game, short but sweet experience filled with some humor, remarkable music and probably some tears as well. Play the game as intended, do not haste, do not do anything else while playing it and I’m sure your money will be a good investment. Enjoy the story.\n\nPS: As you may have noticed, English is not my first language so I apologize for the lack of a better grammar and steady writing.","January 2, 2015","true","5.6"," 51 of 57 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","51","57","2","0"

To the Moon is set in a world where scientists can fullfil and create memories and thus giving John who is the centre charector a chance to complete his final wish to travel  To the Moon . You play as two of these scientists and it becomes clear early on that visiting people's memories to fullfil these wishes is just part of their job,  and that they hold no emotional ettachment with their clients. As the story unfolds you are forced to visit John's unpleasent memories which are tied together with completing this wish, as the two scientists witness these remininescences of the past they begin to connect with John, you slowly begin to see that in this special case they no longer consider it their duty nor their obligation to fullfill this task but too do it out of good will - they begin to care for him. As the story progresses it takes you on an emotional rollercoaster, like the two scientists the theme transferred i started to care for John.

It's no easy feat to create a story that progresses backwards in time so that you can fully appreciate the present. The game is short, which may be a perk for some and not others. I feel the length of this game was perfect. There are many references in this game, and it's fun to find them! The sound track is beautiful and really helps influence your emotions.\n\nThis game is emotion and story driven. As for gameplay mechanics, you basically walk around (using your mouse), collecting memories so that you can progress to the next period in time. You watch this dying man's life unfold from the present until he was a young child. This is a heavy dialog game, and you have to click to go through the dialog. So walking, collecting, and dialog. Each time you progress to the next point in time, you have to solve a little puzzle. The puzzles aren't that difficult, and I found it kind of fun.\n\nYou grow to really care about the characters. You sympathise with them.\n\nIf you do not shed even one little tear at the end, you might want to have yourself tested.

It's about two doctors that travel to fulfill a dying mans last wish. The story is told in a very different way. You controll these two doctors through a bunch of memories. The memories are about Johnny life and his love for River. It's about how he lived his life and what happend during it. Time- travelling, puzzle solving game with much dialogue. The music in this game, mostly piano music, is freaking amazing. It's right on time, very fitting. The conversation between the doctors is really fun. It's good, because the rest of the story is very sad and emotional. The doctors argue about anything really, from olives to driving skills. It made me smile several times. If I had to say something bad about the game? The controls. Sometimes you click and the characters dont really move as you want them to. It can be a bit awkward, but its not that much of a problem since it's mostly just dialogue and not that much moving around. The puzzles are simple, yet fun. To be honest I really like when they're simple because I think hard puzzles are just off-putting and frustrating in a story-heavy game like this. If you happend to like pixelgames or just want a game focused more on story then gameplay, then this is the game for you.","May 17, 2014","true","13.4"," 28 of 36 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","28","36","0","6"

After a few marvelous tear drops tonight I reminded myself that I still needed to write a review for this game, even though I completed it months ago. But hey, better late than never!\n\nMy goodness, where do I even start?! I'd like to say so many things about this game, but at the same time I could sum it up in one sentence: It's an amazing game that everyone needs to play, period! Even if you're not a fan of RPG-maker games, this game is well worth the try. The story alone makes this an incredible experience for sure. So let's just get this over with:\n\nAbout\n\n"This particular story follows Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts’ attempt to fulfill the dream of the dying elderly man, Johnny. In their mission to do so, they traverse backwards through the man’s memories, unfolding his curious life story before their eyes. With each step back in time, a new fragment of Johnny’s past is revealed. And as the two doctors piece together the puzzled events that spanned a life time, they seek to find out just why the frail old man chose his dying wish to be what it is."\n\nWhat's good\n\n+ Cute style\n+ Atmospheric\n+ Beautiful soundtrack\n+ Amazing story\n+ Sweet price tag\n+ 2 Free (extra) chapters\n+ (perfect length to play through in one sitting, as to not lose the immersion)\n\nWhat's bad\n\n- Not a whole lot of gameplay, but the story makes up for it\n\nRecommended to:\n\nEveryone. I could go on forever about how amazing the game is, but you'll just have to experience it yourself. Lastly, again, don't neglect this game for its RPG-maker style graphics. It actually sat in my library for months at first, solely because I didn't like how it looked. Oh, how stupid I was.

The basic gist of it is that you work for a company that help dying people fulfill their wishes. In the case of the main patient in the storyline, this wish is to go to the moon. Saying any more than that would be spoiling the storyline, which is by far the main reason why you'd want to play this game in the first place.\n\nThe gameplay itself is quite mundane. It looks and plays somewhat like a 16-bit era RPG, but without combat. It's rare that you'll find yourself lost for any significant amount of time. The game is also very (written) dialogue-heavy, so if you're not a fan of reading, this probably isn't the game for you. The soundtrack is quite superb.\n\nThe game will generally take you around 3-4 hours to complete. Given the nature of the game, I would recommend completing the game in one sitting.\n\nOverall, I personally loved this game, although I have to admit that it's not for everyone. I personally bought this for $2.50 AUD, and I thought it was worth every penny. With that said, the game has practically zero replay value and is relatively short. I would overall recommend people try the game out if they're willing to sit down and appreciate a good, touching storyline.","June 23, 2014","true","14.8"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

Shallow. Boring. Pretentious. But I wasn't very far in. I knew it wasn't fair to judge a game without giving it a proper chance.\n\nSo I kept playing, in the beginning forcing myself, assuming it was just another overrated artsy game with no real meat to it. Well I was wrong; without noticing, I began to feel myself compelled to keep going, the feeling growing stronger the longer I played. Soon enough, I almost literally had to see the next part. I actually played it all in sitting, unable to pull myself away despite it having kept me up past 5 in the morning at that point.\n\nIt drove me on relentlessly, leaving me constantly wanting to know what was next, and why such-and-such a thing happened... why characters were who they were. I kept thinking I came to a conclusion, when once again it would twist my thoughts.\n\nI came to the brink of tears repeatedly towards the latter part of the game. I winced when I saw something bad happen. I smiled for the characters when they were happy. It ripped my heart out to see them suffer. And then I realized – I’m feeling so strongly for a bunch of pixelated sprites, not even realistic looking things… this game is THAT powerful.\n\nI told myself again and again, “Don’t cry. Don’t cry. It’s just a game.” But when the ending came, there was nothing I could do. The waterworks were coming whether I liked it or not.\n\nThat’s not to say the game is depressing. Far from it: It’s sad, it’s happy, it sprinkles in humor when it knows it needs to… and it ends in such a way that your tears most certainly won’t be of sadness. It pulls at your heart and mind simultaneously; it makes your emotions come out full force and provokes your thoughts with the many questions, both story and real life related, it poses to the player.\n\nQuite simply, it was -the- most moving, beautiful game I’ve ever played, and I recommend it to absolutely everyone.\n\nBuy it, play it, and don’t stop until the end.","December 29, 2012","true","4.1"," 13 of 13 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","13","13","0","5"

Entranced by the story and pieces soon to be discovered, you had mindlessly flipped through the pages until you arrived at the very last word followed by the final ".". You skim through the pages, frenetically looking for more content. You think to yourself, surely there must be more pages, something more that I can grasp, something to keep me in this wonderful story. But you sigh as you realize the magic is over and the author intended on ending the story on that final page. Soon after, you begin to make connections you never made before, piecing together the story like a jig-saw puzzle one would complete and stow away for a lifetime of memories. Enter To the Moon.\n\nTo the Moon takes you on a backwards adventure through time. During this process, To the Moon has the unique ability to triple as a mystery, puzzle, RPG, story-driven experience. This 5-hour journey into the conscious mind of John(ny) Wyles, an old and venerable man and widower, manages to engage people with a series of moving discoveries. While absorbed in To the Moon, you will experience every emotion possible. It's unavoidable. You will somehow manage to have tears in your eyes within the first hour of the anecdote and be laughing a minute later, as I did. From sadness and confusion, to awe and excitement, to anger and disbelief, and finally happiness, To the Moon leaves you with a feeling of warmth and a unique remembrance of the narrative of John(ny) Wyles. The man who wanted to venture to the moon, but could not remember why.\n\nFinal Ratings\nGameplay: 8.5/10 - Being made from an RPG maker, there are some points where I was unsure how to advance in the story and had to do a bit of "random clicking".\n\nStoryline: 10/10 - One of the best story-driven games I have played. Second to Thomas Was Alone (see review)\n\nSoundtrack: 10/10+ - Creates the prefect ambience for every situation found within the story.\n\nCombat: N/A\n\nScary?

Not something you can just play anytime, you have to leave it for the right moment.\n\nLuckily, I had a new reason to get back to it, and last night decided to download it again and give it a second chance. I could write about the game, I could write about me playing it and feeling this or that, but I think it should be enough to say that, after a short time, I realized it's past 5 am and I had to be at work soon. Yes, the game is slow to grab you, but once it does... omg! After just a few 'jumps' you get this horrible feeling of something being really wrong, and the need to find out what it is surpases the simple wish to play the game and finish it. It is what holds you glued to the screen to the very end, what forces you to learn how to solve those short puzzles faster so the story can continue as soon as possible, what will keep you playing even during the otherwise stupid horse riding scene, which is totally wrong for a game like this in a technical sense and could have destroyed it completely by forcing people to quit... if not for the gripping storytelling that simply does not let you move away.\n\nIt's a game that I will think about a lot, and that, more than anything else, makes it a work of art.\nIt's a well written animated book, with characters full of life, well motivated and engaging. It's something that will stop the world for you, and make you sad knowing that not everyone will have the will to give it a chance. But they should.

So I kind of went into this expecting to be incredibly depressed by the end. Fortunately it’s not all that bad.\nIt has a very emotional story to it but all in all it’s a wonderfully imaginative game with a satisfying ending.\n\nCharacter wise, there is a nice contrast between what I guess you would call two sets of main characters. You have the couple who are followed throughout the game, and the work colleagues, that are doing the following. I say ‘contrast’ because they are pretty much opposites of each other. The couple are in love and are going through their struggles together in a very emotional way, whilst the two work colleagues are that typical brother/sister relationship. Messing around, insulting each other and generally just being a very comedic pair.\n\nThe music in this game is absolutely amazing. It is integrated into the game wonderfully and it really does get those emotions going at the right times. Now, as a girl I cried a fair few times. My brother rolling his eyes as if to say ‘typical woman’ after asking if I had finished it, me swinging round with that ‘I wasn’t crying, I had something in my eye’ look. But even with that taken into account, I still think this is something that guys can enjoy as well. Maybe they won’t ‘cry’ like I did, but it still tugs on those heart strings.\n\nStory wise, I have to admit it’s not anything like I imagined it would be. I knew there was going to be a couple, a struggle and a few heartbreaking moments, but I never thought the story would be set how it is. It’s really a very surreal kind of game that I guess can be compared partially to Inception. These work colleagues are hired to do a job inside the head of their client. Which opens up a lot of possibilities for the story. It isn’t as predictable as you might think and it brings a lot of neat game mechanics with it.\n\nFinally, the graphics. I love this style of graphics and whenever I’m recommended a game with this kind of style it is always going to be something I will try. I don’t even know what you call it but I just refer to it as the Pokémon-game-ish-style. It makes the game even more unique then it already is, and strangely enough, at one point while I was playing it, I actually got the feeling that if the graphics were any different it wouldn’t be as easy to get so attached to the characters and generally get into the game. The simplistic graphics actually make it what it is, in my own opinion.\n\nAll in all, it’s a wonderful game and I think it is definitely worth a try for those who like a good story.\n\nTL;DR : Great characters, beautiful music, good story and pleasing graphics. Emotional but well worth the time put into it. Buy it!\n","April 23, 2014","true","4.9"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","13","15","0","0"

There is (or was) no controller support, the game has a few bugs, it's not always clearly visible where you can walk and where there's an invisible blockwall, and i dont know if there was even an option to change the resolution.\n\nThe interesting thing about that is though, that it doesnt matter one bit. Play the game. Don't read any more about it, avoid any information about it as well as possible, and for goudas sake, do yourself the favor and dont watch a let's play. You would regret it forever.\n\nThis game is about its story and the feelings it conveys, made possible as well by the charming artstyle and the perfect soundtrack, which now is finally available as FLAC, which is actually the reason I'm writing a review now, the soundtrack alone is worth way more than anyone ever paid for it.\nAnd one has to experience it by oneself, it would be a terrible waste to know that much about it, that there's nothing to experience anymore. Or to say it like this: If i had the chance to forget all of it, so i can replay and experience it all over again, i'd do it.\n\nOf course, it won't be everyones kind of game, I know some Idio-... people who think: "If i want to read a story, i can read a book, i don't have to play a game for that", but at least to me, games are way more personal. Even if you don't really have many choices, you still get more involved, by moving around in the world which the game is presenting to you, and experiencing it at your own pace, in your own way.\n\nIn my admittedly kinda dull NEET-life, where every day is basically like the last, the next, or any other for that matter, I always forget what i did at some point, as there is just nothing special about it. But i can remember one of those days clearly. I remember sitting in my room (well, as always), tucked in a blanket, drinking rooibos tea. It was evening outside, later even night, and it was snowing with the snow lying around 6-8centimeters high. I still had some peels lying next to my screen, from the clementines i ate earlier that day, and they and the rooibos distributed a comfortable fragrance throughout the room.\nAnd i remember all this for one reason only. It was the day that i played To the Moon.","November 29, 2013","true","6.8"," 14 of 17 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","14","17","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/YogurtStorm/recommended/206440/","YogurtStorm","YogurtStorm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/YogurtStorm/","1070 products in account","9.5/10\nSo... You're here to take me to the moon?\n\nOverview\nTo The Moon doesn't offer much in the gameplay department. It doesn't present stunning visuals nor is it particularly exciting... But it doesn't pretend to offer any of those things. It's short, honest, beautiful and emotionally consuming. A solid piece of masterful storytelling.\n\nStory\nThe story follows the whimsical Dr. Neil Watts and level-headed Dr. Eva Rosalene, high-ranking employees of the Sigmund Agency of Life corporation, a service that specializes in altering a terminal person's memory before time of death in order to make their dreams come true. Basically, they're selling deathbed happiness.\n\nTo The Moon isn't a comedy, though it's hilarious. It isn't a tragedy though it's heart-rending. What it is is brilliant. The dialogue is as powerful and relatable as the thematic is harrowing. I don't want to go into too much detail about the story; I want you to experience the twisty narrative of it by yourselves.\n\nGameplay\nAt first glance, the game plays like you'd expect an RPG to play, minus any form of combat or statistical management. The gameplay mechanics are bare-bones: You walk around, talk with people and interact with objects to progress in a linear fashion. The walk-and-interact gameplay is briefly diversified every now and then with a series of flip-tile puzzles. These are never too difficult and are not detrimental to the experience in the least. Other unexpected gameplay elements are also introduced for brief segments, all of which are an appreciated change of pace.\n\nDr. Watts and Dr. Rosalene enter the mind of John (their patient) and start off in a late memory. They need to understand the patient's history in order to progress farther back into his past and construct variables to influence the patient's future. The goal is simple: Work your way through John's memories and spark the changes that will alter his future forever.\n\nAudio\nThe original soundtrack may be the strongest aspect of the game. It's strongly in-tune with the emotions that the game attempts to pull out of you and often feels like it leads the resulting impressions. I can't lie, I had to hold back tears to Laura Shigihara's "Everything's Alright" when it ripped the limelight from the scene during which it's presented.\n\nTechnical\nThough the game isn't a technical marvel in itself, the user interface is pretty bland and appears "cheap". The lack of options or settings is odd and the game does not support the Steam overlay. These are all very minor shortcomings and I could only bring myself to shave off a fraction of a point for these. The game otherwise runs well, saves automatically to prevent progress loss and it all just works.\n\nThe TL;DR\nAn engaging fable of love, waning time and the human condition it encompasses.

It DEMANDS to be played.\n\nI'll be the first to say that the 16-bit gameplay isn't earth-shattering.  I'll also say that the minigame that is a part of the forward gameplay isn't particularly masterminded...just being a sliding puzzle.  Yet here I am still writing a review on To the Moon because it has still left a footprint on me.  What does set this game apart however  is the impeccable writing and story.  There are moments you find yourself smiling at the humor, and there are moments you find yourself saddened with the emotional connections you are making with the characters.  I finally broke down to purchase this game during the Autumn Steam Sale because of all the rave things I had heard on reddit.com from users about this game.\n\nThe game will take only about 4 HRs of your time, and most certainly will leave you yearning for more storytelling like this.  This musical composition is near genius with original pieces, and the fact that they were able to make such a moving game on this kind of medium says more than anything my review ever could.  THIS is why we support Indie games.  I can still tangibly feel the heart and soul that were placed with love into this game.","December 4, 2013","true","7.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

For the most part, I enjoyed the it, and can agree with what a majority of steam users have to say about this splendid game. But while I found it enjoyable, it's not without its problems.\n\nThe main premise of To The Moon is that two doctors-Eva and Neil (which you'll be playing as)-work for a company that "reconstructs" dying people's memories so that they can pretty much live their life again without any regrets. The patient in question that Eva and Neil must help is a man named Johnny, a dying old man who dreams of going to the moon. Without trying to spoil much, Eva and Neil will travel throughout Johnny's memories so that they can alter his life so that he eventually becomes an astronaut that reaches the moon (It’s a cool and simple premise that is easy to understand, and becomes even more interesting when you look at it through a symbolic point of view). They’ll also learn about his relationship with a girl named River and exactly why Johnny wants to go to the moon.\n\nThe gameplay consists of you wondering around Johnny's memories looking for important moments/objects in his life so that you can go back further into Johnny's past (ex:  a toy that he's treasured all his life, or a life changing event). There really is no action in the game (the screenshot[cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com] on the store page depicting a turn based battle is incredibly misleading, since it's only used on one part as a joke), although this is not a bad thing. Looking for the hidden mementos (and solving the puzzles at the end of each section) is actually kind of fun, and in narrative games like this, sometimes it’s best if there is less action. So if you’re the type of person that only plays games that involve action/fighting, stop reading this review right now. I'd also like to add that the graphics are nice (though keep in mind that the game was made on an RPG Maker engine) and so is the soundtrack (although it can be quite annoying to hear the same songs repeated, although this is a minor problem).\n\n\nSo why exactly did I not find it fully enjoyable? I think the answer would be with the two main characters: Eva and Neil.\n\nThroughout To The Moon, there are many moments where the game will just make you want to tear up, whether it be tears of sadness or joy. With that being said, having one of the protagonists [Neil] say things such as “HADOUKEN!” and “You never cockblock someone in the middle of a kamehameha!” (yes, that is an actual quote from the game) shortly after these emotional scenes completely ruins the mood. A majority of the dialogue between the two is usually Neil making a lame joke, and then Eva responding sarcastically (or just “…”). I’m probably the only person that thinks this, but I feel that most of the time these jokes ruin the flow of the game, shifting it from a sad love story to a lame comedy. Even a majority the jokes that don’t coincide with dramatic moments come out as a bit lame: mainly because they are usually modern day reference jokes (though this is not to say they can be funny every now and then-the scene where they travel to important parts of Johnny’s life just to convince him to be an astronaut made me chuckle a bit). Aside from their sense of humor, some elements regarding what Eva and Neil do seem a bit odd. Why are Neil and Eva so hostile towards Johnny, the person they’re supposed to be helping? If they’re always this hostile to their patients and don’t feel like going through all of this, why are they working for a company that’s main goal is to help dying people? *SPOILER* Why do Eva and Neil have to run back quickly to witness the death of Johnny’s brother, even though they can reset the simulation and watch it over again (which Eva does later in the game)? These are just a few of my questions regarding the game.\n\nYou’re probably thinking that I hate this game after reading the previous paragraph. Well I don’t. The rest of the game still manages to deliver a sweet, sad story about a man wanting to become an astronaut and be with the girl that he loves. Even after a while, Eva and Neil-who I spent an entire paragraph bashing-start to grow on you. It all culminates to one of the most heart-touching endings (and games) that I’ve seen in a while.\n\nPick it up when you have the chance: you [most likely] won’t regret it.","April 3, 2014","true","6.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","12","14","0","3"

I sat down and did this game start to end and simply couldn't put it down. It's incredibly powerful and sad. There have been a very small handful of stories that I'd say have made a really deep impression on me, something I end up remembering for the rest of my life, those tales and characters that are so touching and poignant that they sort of become part of me, making me want to dedicate and live my life for them and succeed where they could not, and become a better person that way.\n\nThis is one of those stories. And I absolutely will not tell you the plot of the story. I could never do it justice. The game presents all these weird puzzling plot items and ideas at the start of the game, but then ties them together in Act 3. My gosh. It hit me so hard.\n\nThe game flirts with existential philosophy, and that is referenced a couple times by the characters but is more an undertone of the game rather than the main focus and story. There is also a fair amount of banter and humour between the two playable characters, that had me laughing out loud on occasion.\n\nIt has a very linear plotline and map and is written in the RPG Maker XP engine. Slightly clunky UI, the windowed mode is incredibly small and unable to be resized, so the game is meant to be played full screen. Nothing too egrerious however, I found a couple small annoyances like movement obstacles and not knowing where to go during the horse part, but they were easily ignored.

Though I doubt I'm the expected or intended audience (57-year old male) I DID enjoy the game, but as to loving it? Not so sure.\nThe writing wasn't realistic, being more on the level of teenage dialog. That, combined with some very mature themes (meaning concepts, not parentally objectionable items) created an odd blending. The mixing in of mini-games further contributed to a sense of (almost) absurdity, especially the (in my opinion) completely unnecessary zombie game.\nAt about the halfway point I found myself intending to finish, but wishing it wouldn't take too much longer. Then things changed. Around the middle of Act 2 the story became deeper, more real, more emotional. I did NOT cry, but I will admit to tearing up at the absolute purity of the young love that EVEN old men dream of. And the music was VERY nice.\nMy opinion isn't important, other than to me. Yes, I AM glad I played this game. Perhaps due to the nature of it, it needed the filling-out that I found slightly tedious and unnecessary, without which the game would have been still shorter. While I might not recommend this to other 57-year old men, I would CERTAINLY suggest it for almost anyone else. (I would have been nice to get the achievement, but apparently that doesn't happen on a Mac. The brief gametime is result of offline play.)","December 7, 2014","true","1.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BeckyGee/recommended/206440/","BeckyGee","Bex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BeckyGee/","190 products in account","Note: I received a copy of To The Moon for my birthday!\n\nFirst off I would like to start by stating that you don't actually have to use your mouse (some people get annoyed), you can use your arrow keys and your space bar (interaction key) and just use your mouse as a guide. Also, this game's graphics isn't the best (pixel art) but I promise it actually grows on you and you will start to like it. Especially because there are some sick illustrations later on.\n\nPositives:\n+ Deep storyline (very well thought out, kudos to the Developer's efforts) - you don't actually know what to expect when you first start playing this game; it's much more than you think it is\n+ Relatively nice graphics (Pixel Art)\n+ Beautiful and fitting music (Situational)\n+ Extra minisodes (DLCS)\n+ Character development is simply wonderful, and very well done\n+ Good excuse to go grab some ice cream as soon as you get to 'Act 3' (I cried a little)\n+ Maps aren't too large, but large enough to explore thoroughly and enjoyably especially with the little dialogues or things you pick up\n+ Relatively easy puzzles, but not too easy - it also displays the lowest amount of moves needed to complete the puzzle which makes you visualise the outcomes and how to complete it with the least amount of moves. Tip: As soon as it tells you about the diagonal flipping, use it because almost every puzzle afterwards requires it (to achieve least amount of moves)\n+ Saving options are very well thought out - automatic saves for important actions and you can also use manual saving\n+ There are nice little extras in the game menu where it shows you the items you have and specific 'notes' or interesting things you have found out - this is updated quite frequently and worth your time to check out\n\nNegatives:\n- Although I loved the character development and thought it was very well done, I definitely would have liked it more if there was more background information about Johnny's mother. We only know a little about her but I feel like she plays a bigger role than that.\n- Puzzles that can get repetitive (it's not too bad)\n- Walking speed is quite slow and can get annoying waiting for them to hurry up\n- Some larger maps can get tedious - walking around and finding things\n\nOverall:\nThe main focus of the actual game (storyline) is very beautiful, relatable and enjoyable. It made me cry after 'Act 3' at various scenes (those who have played know what I mean). The way the story is set out seems a bit odd at first, but as you continue on it makes a lot of sense and I feel is the perfect way to lay it out. The ending was simply beautiful and you don't really see it coming - in fact, you don't see many events (plot twists people) happening until it does. There is a little bit of humour, especially with the protagonists and it's a very deep, heartfelt story. Despite the negatives, I would like to say that the postitives definitely outweigh the negatives.\n\nI love stories like these because you don't have to make any serious choices, yet the choices the protagonists make, makes you think about your morals and what you would do in such a situation. I've spent some time considering the many options and the options the protagonists made plus the repurcussions and their situations, and I finally came to the conclusion of what was morally correct. I'm fully content with the ending. I think this game is a lot about the morality of how these people help the man, as well as others. The DLCs do explore the concept of morality and how some people think what they do is immoral.\n\nScore: 9/10\nIt's not perfect but it's close enough. Definitely worth the full price (and if you like the music, get the soundtracks too) and you get free minisodes (DLCS).\n\nI could go on and on and on... But let me say this: Just play the game, you won't regret it.","October 21, 2015","true","5.7"," 15 of 22 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","15","22","2","1"

It's an interactive story, and a phenomenal one at that. So if you're one of those people who refuse to play interactive story experiences for whatever reason, then you'll probably get nothing out of this.\n\nFor the rest of you, I say strap yourselves in and give it a shot. To The Moon is an emotional journey through a dying man's memories in order to fulfill his last wish of going to the moon. To say more really spoils what makes it so great, but suffice to say I went into this with fairly low expectations (it is an RPG Maker title after all) and came away from it wondering why we haven't had more stories in gaming that were this compelling. I couldn't actually pull myself away from the screen until I'd completed it and left going "argh, the feels!"\n\nAs a result, I can do nothing but recommend To The Moon.

Reflecting? Contemplating the meaning of life? Experiencing the dreaded feels?\n\nYeah, probably.\n\nIn To The Moon you take control of two doctors/scientists who have been hired by a dying man to grant his last wish - to go the moon. Though it is an odd request, the doctors do not question it. But to get him there, they must piece together his blurred memories, of loss, of love, of his complicated relationship with the love of his life.\n\nIt feels almost intrusive to walk through a stranger's most delicate memories, and they invite you to examine your own relationships with the ones you love, flawed and complex as they may be.\n\nPlay when you're contemplative, you won't regret it.","September 17, 2014","true","4.9"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","3"

It has a very strong storyline. This game has everything; mystery and suspense which keeps you on the edge of your seat, emotional moments that'll move you in a way that very few games would ever have. The game has great dialogues consisting of wit and humour. The soundtrack is simply amazing and it changes according to the situations in the game. This is a game that will get you deeply attached to the characters, it will simultaneously break your heart and warm it.\n\nI actually completed the game at a stretch of a few hours. The story had me compelled to play it. It literally made me cry at some points and made me really happy at times.

Two scientists dive into a dying man's mind to alter his memories in order to fulfil his final wish. And yes, the game is just as awesome as it sounds. It has some really cool moments and even though the idea is pretty surreal, it is presented to you in a way that it just sucks you in and the game MAKES you believe it is all actually possible. Not only that, you will feel for these characters. Rarely have there been games that tug on my heart strings the way this game did. Some people seem to finish it in one sitting, take 2 or 3 hours to complete it but it took me 5.2 hours for 1 playthrough from beginning to end. I like to be thorough in my games, especially the story heavy ones that rely on exploration. You will want to take it all in with this game because it is just that good.\n\nIt is a very basic point and click game, nothing overly complicated and it doesn't require too much work, there are some minor riddles to solve but in the end, it relies for the most part on its emotion heavy story. The game is story driven and the visuals and soundtrack are both there to intensify the experience. Some songs might come over as repetitive (something actually made fun of within the game itself) but you will hardly notice this because the music is just that good. The graphics are reminiscent of the Super Nintendo era and it works for this game. Finally 'To the Moon' is jam packed with useless nerdy trivia for gamers and people who watch all the good tv shows.\n\n'To the Moon' is dark, atmospheric and you won't leave the game unmarked.","May 5","true","5.2"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

The game only takes a couple hours to complete, but it is definitely worth it just to experience the story.  The music is beautiful as well and fits perfectly with the story.\n\nThe gameplay, however, is at the level where some people may not even call it a game.  While it looks like a classic JRPG, the level of interaction offered is very low.  It mostly consists of walking around to discover what triggers the next cutscene.  At some points the level of interaction offered is almost insulting, with the game giving you control just for a couple seconds to do something easily accomplished during the cutscene.  It's almost as if it's trying to remind you that you're playing a game, not watching the story.  Later in the game, it turns into more of a hidden object game where you solve simple puzzles between chapters which is much more pleasing.\n\nTo The Moon is a game that needs to be experienced.

The sad, touching, tear-jerking story. Seriously, if you don't cry you're not human. It's hard to talk about why the game is so great without spoiling the story. The characters have a profound personality rarely seen in a videogame, and they share a deep pure love. The beautiful music just make the experience even more enjoyable.\n\nThere's two control schemes, arrow keys or mouse (No WASD for you). Mouse control can be a bit clunky sometimes, with your characters not going at first click where they're supposed to go; playing with a keyboard is faster and more efficient but then you won't have a clue about what things you can interact with.\nYou can choose from 10 different languages.

Todays destination will be: the Moon!'\n\nOkay let's be honest: the gameplay of 'To the Moon' is quite boring, it's repetitive and often more annoying than entertaining. It's not the typical 'Fighting & Fantasy'-RPG-Maker game but a strictly linear adventure whichsets its focus on the story about an old man and his dying wish. Sure, there are minigames and some 'better' levels, but after the fifth time collecting some memory links to go on to the next level I just thought 'C'mon just skip this, I don't want to do this agai-... great another memory link level'. But I still recommend this game - without any doubts - to everyone who enjoys a good story.\n\nYou ask why? It'S true, for me 'To the Moon' is an 'average' game at best, but at the same time it's a fantastic 'movie' with an interesting story backed up by an amazing soundtrack, well-written dialogues, interesting characters and an atmosphere that makes up for many flaws.

More than anything else, game developers should strive to give us games that are both memorable and satisfying.  A game that makes you feel and experience something extraordinary.\nTo the Moon is not gorgeous in terms of graphics.  What it lacks in graphics, it makes up for its interactive story telling.  It lets you take part in a tale that is both hearthwarming and incredibly tragic.\nThe story immerses you and engages you to fulfill a dying man's (Johnny) last wish to go the moon, by altering his memory and replacing them with alternates ones.\nWhat really made the journey interactive is how you put together bits and pieces of his memory and various highlights of his life and love story with wife (River) in order to progress forward in the story.\nYou will also be carried away by the games soundtrack, specially its main theme also entitled - To The Moon.  It really enhances your game experience and sets the mood in every game sequence.  The game, however, is relatively short, but the game content is what all that matters to me.  The game's message about life and death and the joys and difficulties we might or have already experienced did struck a chord.  In the end all we have our just cherished memories of our loved ones. The moral of the game is' if we had the chance and the ability to change our past, Will you do it?  Maybe some for me.\nI really recommend this to a mature audience or even someone who needs a break from the run and gun games we have in our games library.

It has elements of exploration, story-driven and puzzle, but the main objective seems to be the emotional effect. The game is very successful on enabling that, especially at the ending, because it builds momentum through interaction with “mementos” from various periods of a person’s life. There is a chance you will drop some tears.\n\nThis game is also very special to me because it was given as a gift (thank you again for this!), and it made me think about my own life. I like the way the game mixes humor and drama together, and gives you simple puzzles in between story scenes. Also, the game adds a lot of interface innovations to RPG Maker.\n\nMy take on some points:\n\nRiver’s condition looks like some kind of autism, which is very rare on women.\n\nThe meaning of the two colored paper rabbit becomes clear at some point: the yellow is the moon and the blue is the sky with the stars. John couldn’t know this, as his memory was messy because of the beta blockers.\n\nThe game is somehow based on psychoanalytical arguments, such as: infancy memories are the most important ones. Even when repressed, these memories can affect your conscious decisions.\n\nThe “romantic” ending somehow implies that a perfect relationship can only happen in dreams. In the real world you will always have problems.","March 23, 2014","true","6.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","4"

Graphics are simple, the gameplay is somewhat slow and tedious, the controls awkward, the puzzles very simple and somewhat repetitive.\n\nHowever, the game will reward you with one of the most amazing stories in videogame history. I had not expected so many clever ideas, plot twists, and touching moments in such a short, "simple" game. Best played in one sitting, the game is only 3 to 4 hours depending on how quickly you play through it (my advice would be: don't rush, try to pick up details, of which there are so many in this game). Fantastic story, full of great ideas, and the soundtrack adds so perfectly to this unforgettable experience.

Very few games out there succeed in excellent story and character development that attracts and scars players. To The Moon is one of the few that does an outstanding job in not only nailing this, but also leaving a long-lasting impact.\n\nWithout revealing too much to those that have yet to play - You assume control of two Doctors – Dr. Neil Watts and Dr. Eva Rosalene – whom work for an agency whose job is to reconstruct certain aspects of dying people's memories and fulfil their deepest wishes before their lights are out; in this case, taking Johnny to the Moon. The reason to which I will not explain in this review, otherwise there would be no point in going through all the emotions this game sets out to deliver. Though you can expect a story filled with excellent dialogue and character development with plenty of unpredictable moments\n\nGameplay is fairly straight forward and pretty much the same as TWD or any point-and-click game for that matter. There are a few mini-games and puzzles to add that little challenge factor but nothing overly complicated or mind numbing. Everything is straight forward and easy to pick up.\n\nThe soundtrack is composed to perfection and aids the storytelling in a very unique way. A great mixture of tracks which change depending on the scenario at hand.\n\nThe only aspect that may throw some people off is the fact that there is almost zero replayability, with the average completion time appearing to be anywhere around the 4.5 hour mark. Unless of course certain aspects of the game did not sink in properly the first time and you attempt a second rerun, though this does not bother me at all as it aimed to convey a purpose right from the beginning and was delivered to great satisfaction.\n\nOverall a wonderful game I would very strongly recommend. Do not let the simple graphics fool you!

The graphics may have been like old gameboy games, yet to me, they seemed just as good as the latest and greatest graphics do. I enjoyed it thoroughly, and just when I thought there wasn't going to be any action, there were a few extra sprinkles that brought that into it.

The music, sounds, story, artwork, atmosphere, and delivery unlock a cornucopia of raw and powerful emotions that cling to the obvious passion the developers put into it. It's a pretty remarkable journey of closure, one that is amazingly told backwards.\n\nAll giddiness aside, the gameplay and user interaction are definite weak spots, although quite easy to overlook.

It seems to be one of those typical pretentious indie games at first glance, but by god, this is so much more. Let me get this out of the way first: To the Moon is the game that I cried the most at throughout my whole life.\n\nNow, it doesn't really consist of a lot more than text and accompanying music, but that's way more than enough for immersion into such an amazing story—the plot was absolutely new to me, with no clichés in its integral parts at all. The setting is very similar to, or I'd even dare say borrowed from the movie 'Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind', but it goes way deeper beyond that, to, as far as I know, previously uncharted territories of storytelling. Naturally, because of this, the story was for the most part unpredictable for me; this is what happens when none of your actions really matter and yet the life of someone is depending on them... maybe. I'm really not even sure what to make of this all, I still am in shock after having played through the game and I will need quite some time to completely process what I've seen.\n\nAbove all this, the game has an unbelievably great soundtrack that meshes with the story so well that you'll cry even more just because of the musical score. There's even some really humorous moments in the game, that include but are not limited to: poking fun at those pretentious indie games I mentioned above, breaking the fourth wall, making hilarious puns, having absolutely unexpected moments, and so on. There's clearly tons of attention paid to every detail of the game, having a masterfully crafted experience.\n\nThe negatives: not much, really. The author clearly doesn't have the best technical background, so you'll be stuck playing at a weird resolution no matter what, but it doesn't take a lot to get used to.\n\nI'm still real close to crying. ♥♥♥♥.","July 29, 2013","true","13.5"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","2"

In it, two doctors use a device which allows them to travel through a man's memories, altering them in such a way that in his coma state it allows him to dream that he has lived the life which would have resulted from those alterations.\n\nThe story is the important factor of this game, so I'll refrain from saying any further due to spoilers. It's an excellent story although the writing can be a little mediocre in spots. I'd recommend finishing the game in one or two sittings to get the full experience, but that is not mandatory by any means.\n\nFor those who enjoy narrative-driven games, this is a must purchase.

They crash their car on the way to their latest patient, who wants to believe he went to the moon before he dies, and saying much more than that would begin to ruin the premise, but rest assured it is a GREAT premise. Some very good narrative reveals, great character dialogue (for the most part, details on that later), and a story that you'd have to have a heart of stone not to appreciate on some level. I can admit that I'm a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to games trying to touch my heart, but with the story, visuals and music I couldn't help but give myself over to the experience during a few particularly beautiful sequences.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, there really isn't much to speak of outside of hunting for clues in the levels, solving the picture puzzle at the end of each memory and a few scarce, optional minigames. It's also worth noting that it's a very short game, able to be finished in around 4-5 hours. That being said, it's one of those games I plan on going back to play every couple years, and it's not a very expensive game, either.\n\nMy only real complaints are that the game can be broken fairly easily (Moving through solid environments, walking through cars, I even encountered a glitch early on with the log jumping mechanic that nearly forced me to delete my save and start over) and the dialogue between the scientists can be extremely poorly timed and downright obnoxious and can occassionaly ruin otherwise very touching moments. I understand the need for comic relief in a game like this, but screaming "HULK SMASH!!" and "HADOUKEN!" during emotional moments isn't the way to do it.\n\nEven so, it's still a very enjoyable game that you should definitely play if you get the chance. I wouldn't suggest picking it up for more than a few bucks if you're not the type to replay a game periodically as it is, like I said, only about 4-5 hours long. It's in a bundle right now and it goes on sale very cheaply from time to time, though, so why not pick it up?","January 12, 2014","true","14.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Granted, it is technically a text-driven, point-n-click adventure with a few minigames here and there. Yet when experienced in its entirety, it becomes clear that it is much more than that.\n\nFresh from credits rolling, I can say that it's one of the best stories I've ever been told through the medium of video games. It's a unique, humane piece, unlike any I've come to experience; so elaborately woven together, so well-written and touching with flawless pacing all-around that I could have easily enjoyed it as a book if the author, Kan Gao, had chosen to tell it so. Better yet, this superb script is accompanied by an exquisite audio-visual package that enriches the adventure greatly. The result of the amalgamation of these expertly crafted elements was an experience so rich that I couldn't help myself going through it in a single session, caring about every single one of its small cast of characters and wondering what would I uncover about them next all the way. Needless to say, I found myself being amazed from scene to scene, as the 'game' was delivering everything to be expected from a true work of art in spades.\n\nThe fact that this kind of an experience is not coming from of a first-tier developer but born from the minds and crafted in the hands of a small group of individuals with a small budget is only a nod to their talent. I must admit that I wasn't expecting such a fine-tuned creation with this much of an impact when I first booted the game. But here I am, after a five-hour rollercoaster of emotions, feeling all the more human thanks to this excellent work of art disguised as a game.\n\nMy advice, don't lose any more time reading about To the Moon.

Thankfully you can focus in a review on other aspects aswell:\n\nStory: I don't want to talk too much about the story, because I guess you better have to explore it for yourself and the game is based... well about 50% on the story. Just one hint: "I am round. Sometimes I'm light, sometimes I'm dark, sometimes I'm both. Many people want to walk on me but few ever will. What am I?" ;) Reach it or die trying and you probably finished one of the most awesome games about life, death, love and the inherent struggles mixed with some small puzzles. If I had to rate it, I would give the story 5/5 weaselpoints.^^\n\nGraphic: It's an indiegame, and for an indiegame the graphic is wonderful, because the 16bit style! fits perfect (better then a poorly executed try of "modern" graphic) 5/5 weaselpoints.\n\nSound: It's hard to say, how much the game is based on the story, or on the soundtrack... I decided to split it 50/50... I really enjoyed the story and even as a "grown-up" I caught myself wiping a tear away. But the soundtrack alone is just a masterpiece. Well fitting in the story, without harsh breaks, and still escorts me even without playing the game 5/5 weaselpoints.\n\nLength: I needed about 5h to complete my journey. Even I wish it would have last longer, it's fair for an 8€ indiegame full of awesomeness and emotions compared to some 50€ fullprice highend-graphic junk without a real story but with the same length. 5/5 weaselpoints.\n\nDifficulty: There are no seperate settings for the difficulty but it doesn't matter. The puzzles within the story I would rate as fair and doable for everyone.\n\nSummary: 5/5 I highly recommend this game. A real gem within the flood of indiegames! And even this all wouldn't be enough, the game includes 1 achievement and it's really simple to get!","February 22, 2014","true","9.2"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The characters are so interesting that you immediately being to love them. This has certainly shot up to one of my favourite games.","December 7, 2014","true","4.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It's understandable, money doesn't just grow on trees. But, let's pretend you've got some money floatin' around, and you're looking for something good, something stimulating, but most importantly, something relatively cheap.\n\n"To the Moon" is the game for you.\n\nAssuming the ending hasn't already been spoiled for you, this game will lead you through a (mostly) text-based adventure, wih plenty of twists that will more than likely cause you to finish it in one sitting. However, the brief nature of the game detracts nothing from the story - and believe me, the story is worth experiencing.\n\nIf you're looking for something to think about, something to make you feel, or just something to immerse yourself in, "To the Moon" is a great game with plenty of suprises, incredible characters, and superb writing that will pull you inside it's world. This is one of the few games that I can truly say is worth playing and experiencing.","August 31, 2014","true","4.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

There's really nothing quite like it, and the fact that it's able to convey such a brilliant story WITHOUT voice acting and using 16-bit graphics is genius in itself.\n\nI would put this in the same calibur as a Half Life, Super Mario 64, Warcraft 3, type of level even though there really isn't any gameplay.  I would put it above Life Is Strange and Grim Fandango as well, which were my favorite interactive-story type of games before I played this.

To make this wish a reality, he enlists Dr. Eva Rosaline and Dr. Neil Watts of Sigmund Corp. who are determined to send Johnny to the moon one way or another.\n\nTo the Moon has an incredible story, fantastic artwork, and an absolutely beautiful soundtrack.

It tugs the heartstrings and plays with your emotions but not in a cynical way that left me tearful and sorely impressed at how well delivered the story was. The high concept plot and natural dialogue raise the game well above it's underwhelming artwork and poor hotspot/movement detection and pathing.\n\nRecommended for: People with a heart and a soul for a well told story.

The protagonist, a man with the only wish of reaching the moon, seemingly inexplicable, is dying; so he asks over Doctoress Eva Rosalene and Neil Watts, who belong to the sigmund Agency of Life Generation, in the attempt of reaching his very last wish through artificially implanted memories. However, as the game progresses, the plot thickens and the introspection and the past of the poor elderly protagonist, Johnny Wyles, begins to excite the minds even colder.\n\nThe graphics do not excell but they offer simple and different scenarios. The plot, at least to me, is very reminiscent of Inception (for those who saw it), even if we are talking about memories and not dreams. Johnny and his poor wife are deeply characterized, so much that the gamers are made aware about the wife's health condition, which is not so rare in today's reality. The soundtracks are very impressive, and in any case always suited to the circumstances in which they find themselves. The gameplay is very simple, but the depth of the story manages to entertain the gamer to everyone for the duration (albeit brief) of the game. Yes, the game, unfortunately, is short-lived, but nevertheless It's an experience recommended to all.\n\nDo not be fooled by the low price, as It previously happened to me: It's a MUST HAVE in your Steam Library\n\nItalian Version:\nSono venuta in possesso di questo gioco grazie al consiglio di un amico, che già lo possedeva. Non convinta dell'eccellenza di tale titolo, ho voluto provarlo, e devo dire di averlo sottovalutato per via del prezzo basso.\n\nTo the moon è un'avventura grafica in 2d che si presenta come un gioco dalle dinamiche molto semplici che tuttavia ha molto da offrire ai giocatori.  Il protagonista, un uomo con il solo scopo di raggiungere la luna, apparentemente inspiegabile, è in fin di vita; così convoca nella sua abitazione sopra una scogliera i dottor Eva Rosalene e Neil Watts, appartenenti alla Sigmund Agency Of Life Generation, intento a raggiungere il suo ultimo desiderio attraverso l'impianto di ricordi artificiali. Tuttavia, man mano che il gioco avanza, la trama si infittisce e l'introspezione ed il passato del povero anziano protagonista, Johnny Wyles, inizia ad emozionare anche le menti più fredde.\n\nLa grafica, pur non eccellendo, offre scenari diversificati e semplici. La trama, almeno a me, ricorda molto Inception (per chi l'ha visto), anche se qui si parla di ricordi e non di sogni. La caratterizzazione di Jhonny e della sua povera moglie è ben approfondita, tanto da sensibilizzare la gente sulla condizione di quest'ultima, che non è così tanto rara nella realtà d'oggi. Le colonne sonore sono molto suggestive, ed in ogni caso sempre adatte al contesto nelle quali si trovano. Il gameplay è molto semplice, tuttavia la profondità della storia riesce ad intrattenere il videogiocatore allo schermo per tutta la durata (seppur breve) del gioco. Ebbene sì, il gioco, purtroppo, è poco longevo, ma tuttavia è un'esperienza consigliabile a tutti.\n\nNon fatevi ingannare dal prezzo basso, com'è successo a me, è un MUST HAVE in libreria.","January 27, 2015","true","14.5"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","7","10","0","3"

With such a wonderfully written storyline riddled with humerous and nostalgic references alike, TtM really shines with it's interpretation of memories. When I played the first few moments I expected an interesting Sci-Fi interpretation of how the mind works, which was delivered promptly, but I hadn't expected how utterly mind-blowing of a level it would reveal itself to land on.\n\nFlawlessly implementing emotional story-telling, point-and-click gameplay, and an ocean of character progression, TtM leaves you on the edge of your seat, yearning for the next act of the three installments. I haven't felt the pressure of tears behind my eyes as a result from a game since Kingdom Hearts and Shadow of the Colossus were released in 2002 and 2005 respectively. Had this game been released during my preadolescence, it would've been just as impacting on my development as those two games were. In all honesty, even at this stage of my life, I found this game to be rather impacting, as well as eye opening on many levels.\n\nTo the Moon is a game I'd recommend for all ages, as a casual point-and-click story driven adventure RPG, it has so much to offer to every generation.

It's not that there's nothing to talk about, actually it's the opposite. The problem is that basically there are spoilers everywhere. I'm gonna tread very carefully. The game is about two doctors: Neil Watts, and Eva Rosalene. However, they are not medical doctors. Their job is to visit the dying, and use special technology to alter their memories to include their final, last wish so they can die happy. Their patient is Johnny Wyles, an elderly man who wants to go to the moon. Here's the kicker, he doesn't know why. Understanding the motivation for a dream is essential in altering the memories for the person owning said dream. This is so fitting the memory in the person's life becomes much simpler. I'm not gonna go an inch farther in terms of discussing the story, it's for your own good.\nThe gameplay is hardly there, it's pretty much a full on visual novel. However, traversing Wyles' memories involves picking up memory links that let the two doctors piece what they know together. You travel back connecting the memory links with a certain memento per memory period. You then complete a very simple puzzle to add in a little bit of player input. But overall you are really just watching a movie.\nBecause I'm choosing to talk about almost nothing, I'm gonna have to cut this short. This game has made a reputation for itself as the home of genuine feels, and I agree. Not only is this game funny, but it is also serious and realistic. This has been said many times before, but it makes my point, "You don't need polygons to make people." And that is true. It's been a long time since I genuinely cared about the characters I'm controlling and learning about. If you're not convinced, I beg you, I IMPLORE you, please risk a few dollars to get this game.

Or Final Fantasy IV. (ZING) So while there are a few mini-games, To The Moon doesn't require your senses of strategy or customization like the 90's-era JRPG's it's designed in the style of. What is DOES require is simply four continuous hours and a box of tissues.\n\nTo The Moon has a beautifully crafted story. Look no further if you're looking from something that can switch to heartfelt to depressing to shocking to laugh-out-loud hilarious at the drop of a hat. Or several hats, rather.\n\nAnd the story is greatly helped by the fact that the writing is excellent. From John & River's love story told in reverse, to the banter between Doctors Watts & Rosalene, everything simply feels natural. The subtle references to Doctor Who and How I Met Your Mother are the icing on the cake.\n\nI was going to put something else - largely to wrap this up - but whatever. Just go play it. (I was serious about the "four continuous hours" thing, though. This is the type of game that's meant to be played in one sitting.)\n\nOh, and the music is great too.","February 4, 2013","true","8.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

With such a wonderfully written storyline riddled with humerous and nostalgic references alike, TtM really shines with it's interpretation of memories. When I played the first few moments I expected an interesting Sci-Fi interpretation of how the mind works, which was delivered promptly, but I hadn't expected how utterly mind-blowing of a level it would reveal itself to land on.\n\nFlawlessly implementing emotional story-telling, point-and-click gameplay, and an ocean of character progression, TtM leaves you on the edge of your seat, yearning for the next act of the three installments. I haven't felt the pressure of tears behind my eyes as a result from a game since Kingdom Hearts and Shadow of the Colossus were released in 2002 and 2005 respectively. Had this game been released during my preadolescence, it would've been just as impacting on my development as those two games were. In all honesty, even at this stage of my life, I found this game to be rather impacting, as well as eye opening on many levels.\n\nTo the Moon is a game I'd recommend for all ages, as a casual point-and-click story driven adventure RPG, it has so much to offer to every generation.

As I played, every new discovery left me compelled to uncover more and to find out about the old man's life. At times the dialogue can be a bit silly, but it's much needed comedic relief within a setting that otherwise jumps from tearjerking to heartwarming.\n\nThe gamplay is extremely basic, and whilst it is more present than any gameplay in Gone Home, for example, I would still put this in the "interactive novel" genre as at its core it is simply a story you are uncovering. There are occasionally small puzzles to jump between memories, but I personally found that these became tedious fast and I feel the game would be better without. They do, however, add a little more pacing to the plot and give you some time to think about what you may find next.\n\nTo The Moon is definitely worth buying, I can't imagine anyone being disappointed by such a rollercoaster ride.

It's an interactive story where clicking is required to progress from scene to scene and from dialog to dialog.  The fact that from times to times some ridiculously easy puzzles have to be solved in order to progress doesn't exactly make it a game. There's nothing challenging about it.\n\nAnyway, its best part is the story. It's a complex story that treats matters of life and death in such way that it gets to be felt quite close and personal. I completely don't recommend this to depressive people. I was on the verge of busting into tears several times throughout its duration. The story is great, very touching and impactful. It's hard to speak about it without spoiling it, but I guess I could say it somehow reminds of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, the movie, but only in just a few aspects.\n\nOther than the story (but damn, what a story!...), there was nothing I liked about how "To the moon" presented itself to me. The soundtrack supports the story pretty well, it enhances the feelings that the story transmits, but it gets cheesy at points, near the end. Don't get me wrong, it's an awesome soundtrack that clearly shows the loads of work it required, but it's just not my type, I'm more into the Bastion-like soundtracks.\n\nMany people seem to have found the strength to tolerate the awful graphics, but I still can't ignore them. It's an "RPG Maker"-like, uber low budget kind of graphics that ruined for me the immersiveness of the "to the moon" experience at points. Since the clicking and controlling was also quite imprecise, I think I would've even prefered a slideshow of still images instead of some of the scenes where just moving around was pretty annoying and tedious.\n\nIt also lacks basic settings like sound volume controls, full screen / window mode toggling, screen resolution settings, all the basic stuff. At least it comes with steam cloud support and a pretty neat, single "Steam achievement".\n\nAnyway, I don't regret the money spent on it and the 3 hours and a half that it took me to finish it. It's a great experience. It's also, indeed, worthy of still being considered the saddest game of all.

This game doesn't have a whole lot of gameplay but it brings a spectacular story that everyone should check out. The game's plot is all about people who can go into the minds of a dying person and change their memories to make them think that they achieved their dream to help them die happy. The rest of the story you should experience for yourself. The game has a spectacular soundtrack suiting the mood the entire time and I sat down and played this game all in one sitting because the story was just that good. The gameplay is simple point and click to find things and the game will last you from 3-6 hours depending on how much you explore and how fast you are at reading. I recommend this experience strongly to anyone looking for something new, amazing, interesting, and touching (many people have been known to cry during this game). 99/100","September 16, 2012","true","9.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

It's a story first, and a point and click game second. The game is simply the medium. It's funny, serious, dark and hopeful all at once. A simple concept experienced masterfully, games don't normally affect me but this one struck a chord. The soundtrack is only a couple of very basic tracks, but it is hauntingly beautiful, and deserving of the pickup. In many ways, this game is like a movie experience with the added benefit of your own input and interaction. Visually, it's retro look gives it charm, and it's impressive how much emotion can be conveyed with pixelated animation.\n\nYou take the role of a pair of specialists who enter peoples memories, specifically dying people, to generate an experience from them that they express as a dying wish. In a style reminiscent of Inception they dive into the life of John, to fulfill his wish to go To The Moon. They have great chemistry, with fantastic pop culture references and lots of one liners. The story they discover is touched with meaning and emotion. I can't say what makes this game so great without revealing anything that happens, but it brought me to bittersweet tears.\n\nI bought this on a whim, a whim I now very greatful for. It's a truly enriching game, and it will make you cry.","February 9, 2015","true","3.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

OST is wonderful, worth a download if you can appreciate solo piano. The world is very interesting; it would be great to see more episodes following different people. The game is easy to control and understand.\n\nCONS: Doctor Watts is a major atmosphere-ruiner. I'm assuming his more obnoxious lines were shoehorned in when it appeared the game was a bit too dramatic, but his meme-rife "comedic" relief is very unwelcomed. Much of the graphics are stock.\n\nOVERALL:  To The Moon is a touching endeavor and worth 2-3 hours of your time. The short total playtime and stock graphics may not make it worth its full asking price, but Freebird Games can make a hell of a story that's proof that the video game medium can tell tear-jerkers.\n\nSCORE: 7/10","February 9, 2015","true","6.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dowlphin/recommended/206440/","dowlphin","Dandowlion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dowlphin/","265 products in account","Only minor technical issues. Lowres assets (640x480), main menu cursor hover detection is bit wonky, no windowed fullscreen (makes writing a review difficult when each alt-tab takes a couple of seconds), Options menu with F1 - had to figure that out. Sometimes the music is freaking loud compared to the sound effects. Taking screenshots difficult, because no Steam Overlay. External tool gives mostly white frame, needs cutting.\nMinor tedium sometimes in that you can't click-hold to move, combined with the fact that while left and right image edge is sharp, top and bottom are faded out.\n\nHad a little difficulty in one glitchy scene figuring out what to do (had to consult the forums). Might just have been the reloading that eventually made it work; not sure.\n\nUnskippable launch sequence, but in this game I can understand it's intended to quickly get you back into the mood of the game. And the game is short enough that this won't be a bother.\n\nThe frequently reoccuring minigame introduces a little change to the gameplay, probably made to give some more interaction, even if it's a cheap trick for gving a rewarding feeling when the story itself isn't sufficient. (It would have been though. And finding the pieces for the memento is no challenge anyway.)\nIt's OK though. You're basically executing the protagonists' job, and that's not just all-awesome, but also involves routine. This makes the experience more immersive.\n\nAt first, I was worried the RPG-Makeresque character art style would interfere with the serious style of the story, but that turned out to be no problem. Didn't even need getting used to. (Probably because the character art style is consistently the same throughout the game.)\n\nThe story has depth and several more and less philosophical aspects worthy of pondering on. Generally not an entirely original theme, but unique in detail. I actually find the writing quite mature and natural. Whatever people complain about in reviews regarding the writing, it must be specifically personal distaste.\nThere might be details to the story though that are worth examining for plot holes. And there's a certain more or less surprising twist that was almost ignored by the story progression, which left me a little confused.\n\nIf you appreciate beautiful and touching as well as skillful storytelling and would like to experience it with minimal energy investment needed (I myself wasn't very motivated or energetic when playing it, but I'm usually quite thoughtful), then it's definitely a recommendation. Better than watching it as a four-hours movie would have been. In game format, you can occasionally drift off into your own thoughts without freezing the pace, and dialogue speed is in your control, too. So a game is a nice format for this kind of story.\n\nThe mini-episode DLCs are as thoughtful and entertaining as the main story.\n\n\nP.S.: This game is unsatisfying for achievement-hunters, yet very satisfying for completionists. ;-)\n\n\n\nUPDATE: After seeing a screenshot on the shop page that I didn't encounter during my playthrough, I realize I should probably try a second one with choosing the other character of the duo. It's a nice touch that you can give at least parts of the playthrough a somewhat more drama or comedy spin based on choices you make. It's not fully linear.","June 17, 2015","true","6.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brawlbarian/recommended/206440/","Brawlbarian","PorkOnRye","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Brawlbarian/","143 products in account","To the Moon is a heart-rending tale of dreams, memories, and knowing that love is malleable, capable of taking forms of true beauty, when worked by the right soul. It is my firm belief that you would enjoy To the Moon, so let me sell you further.\n\nPart 1: The Story\n\nThe story starts off with two scientist-type fellows known as Dr. Neil Watts and Dr. Eva Rosalene, employees of a mysterious corporation known as Sigmund Corp. They are specifically tasked with providing the elderly and sick with fulfilling lives before they die, by using the means of a certain memory-altering dream machine that allows them to rewrite their client's memory to fit their ordered specifications. Their client, an old, withering man known only by the name Johnny, has enlisted the help of these two scientists. His request, to become an astronaut and fly high into the sky, to reach the outer edge of the world and engage in a long-awaited rendezvous with the moon. Things go routine for a good while, until it appears that something is very wrong with Johnny's memory. Segmented and heavily disjointed, the mind of the elderly man seems to only connect via a single thread, memories of his deceased wife, River. You'll find along the way that she holds major significance to Johnny, much more than could be originally thought, but I'll leave the satisfaction to you.\n\nPart 2: Gameplay\n\nSurely no game is great without some equally complementing gameplay. Whilst travelling through this cavalcade of emotions and memories, you'll have to deal with searching the man's memories and finding items that can link each piece together, like a grand cranium jigsaw puzzle. Mementos will be scattered about for you to interact and find, and engaging in absorbing the story from each memory is a must if you are to succeed. You'll have to go through some light puzzle elements in order to gain access to the linking power of the mementos, but it's nothing a little brain power can't fix. And even with all this brainiac gameplay, there are indeed moments of action. Remember that squirrel you narrowly dodged on the road? Well, I won't say much, but I can say that you surely haven't seen the last of him. You'll need to have a fighter's spirit, but keeping a shoe handy is about the same.\n\nPart 3: The Lesson\n\nThe game holds with it not only what you can gather from surface value, but it also carries underneath it a plethora of teachings and meanings. Now nothing I say here is set in stone, as you take what you will from the experience, but what I've collected from the game is as follows: One of the hardest things to do is to do nothing at all, that sometimes love will find us no matter where we are, and that strangers we meet can be the most interesting people we will ever get to know. These certainly aren't the only lessons to be drawn from this wonderful game, interpretation is a most beautiful thing. I leave the gorgeously complex teachings of this game to you to find, as making your own connections is supremely satisfying, and I'd be nobody to deny you the pleasure.\n\nOverview\n\nThis game is definitely worth the priced listed. A fine game with charming graphics, a beautiful story, and a heart-rending conclusion that will leave you fully satisfied with your purchase. With the characters very fleshed out and unique, alongside the "worlds" you'd be visiting, not to mention the beautiful OST that'll be accompanying you, I'd give it a most well-deserved 9/10. Buy this game, love this game, remember this game.","December 25, 2015","true","4.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Yes, all before that i read dozen of reviews, everyone of them was so positive i even thought - can this indie game be THAT good? As achievement hunter, i have noticed that SINGLE achievement and that alone was a good reason to buy the game, which i did during autumn sales and....boy was i blown up! The story line is so deep and sensitive, all characters so developed that i finished the game in one sit. The sound, the music, even pixel graphics - it really touches...touches deep inside. As you play, the story flows consistent and you think that you know what will be next and then suddenly - bam, unexpected twist of events! The plot is worth of a good movie or a book. A little gem in my game collection. And besides that it has zero replayability it is worth to live up that story at least once. I STRONGLY recommend this game to everyone !

It's a story first, and a point and click game second. The game is simply the medium. It's funny, serious, dark and hopeful all at once. A simple concept experienced masterfully, games don't normally affect me but this one struck a chord. The soundtrack is only a couple of very basic tracks, but it is hauntingly beautiful, and deserving of the pickup. In many ways, this game is like a movie experience with the added benefit of your own input and interaction. Visually, it's retro look gives it charm, and it's impressive how much emotion can be conveyed with pixelated animation.\n\nYou take the role of a pair of specialists who enter peoples memories, specifically dying people, to generate an experience from them that they express as a dying wish. In a style reminiscent of Inception they dive into the life of John, to fulfill his wish to go To The Moon. They have great chemistry, with fantastic pop culture references and lots of one liners. The story they discover is touched with meaning and emotion. I can't say what makes this game so great without revealing anything that happens, but it brought me to bittersweet tears.\n\nI bought this on a whim, a whim I now very greatful for.

You control the characters Dr. Wyatt and Dr. Rosaleane, scientists within a wolrd in which it is possible to recover memories of their dying patients for a chance to live their final requests and dreams - even if it was not reality and only in their minds.\n\n"Occasionally I'm fortunate enough to play a game that reminds me what's important. Not only what's important in making a great piece of interactive media, but also what's important in life." - Anthony Gallegos\n\nThis story centers around a dying man named Johnny who wished to visit the moon, hence the games title.. To the Moon. Along the way of recovering Johnny's memory a wonderful story of love, and loss unfolds before your eyes. As you progress through layers of memories Johnny will slowly go from being an unconscious old man you don't really care about, to a complex human being whose life you are certain the empathize with. By the end of the game I came to care about Johnny, despite never meeting his "real" self in the overworld.\n\nThe gameplay consists of simple puzzles in order to break through layers of memories and then comes to exploring the memory and watching the story unfold. In other words if you are someone who's interested in fancy graphics and gameplay this isn't for you.\n\nMy weak puzzle solving skills and exploration are not why I have 4 hours in this game, I rather rushed through these parts in order to reach the next scene or dialogue sequence allowing me sight into the minds and hearts of the characters presented. Some games are mindless and are carried through the repetitive actions, gameplay and graphics. To the Moon is reliant on the excellent plot of which will leave you broken.","April 1","true","3.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

Or in this case, it's engine. You might think that a game made in RPG Maker isn't worth your time. Well, in this case you're wrong. Or at least that depends what you're looking for.\n\n'To the Moon' does a lot of things right, but most important and memorable it its writing and atmosphere. Long story short, the game is about exploring a dying man's memories to grant him a final wish. What you get is an emotional ride with both ups and downs, mostly the latter. But the game is all about its story and it's perfectly executed.\n\nBut if you're looking for an RPG, you're looking in the wrong place. The game has no sort of choice-and-consequence system, no fighting (except for one battle, but I won't spoil that!) or nothing that would make this rank as an RPG. The game will always be the same, so there's not much replay value to it.\n\nSo if you're looking for a game with a great story to invest a few hours into, look no further. Freebird Games will prove to you that you don't need to be a AAA-studio to make an enjoyable and memorable gaming experience.","March 24","true","8.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

However, I don't mean that in a bad way, as it's a very good format to tell a story.\n\nThe story follows two doctors working in a company that grants its clients (who are all people on their deathbeds) a last wish of sorts before they die: they rewrite their memories so they can accomplish whatever they dreamed of; in the case of the game, the client is a man who always dreamed of going to the Moon, hence the title of the game. The story is very good, and emotional; and I'd say the game it's worth it for the story alone. Still, I'd make a disservice to the devs, as they managed to craft a very good game not only storywise, but in aesthethics and overall tone. The traditional RPG style fits the game pretty well, and the soundtrack is very good as well.\n\nAs far as gameplay goes, as I said, it has light gameplay; there won't be a lot of fighting or anything like that; only going around interacting with certain objects, and having dialogue with different NPCs. Even then, it's entertaining enough, and the gameplay works to enhance the story.\n\nAfter the main story, there's two extra DLC chapters (which can be downloaded for free), which show a bit more of the company the doctors work for; and it's set during Christmas, after the events of the main game. The tone remains somewhat similar to that of the main game, although there's a few interesting twists (particularly in the second chapter).\n\nWell, I don't think I can say much more about this game, other than I recommend it.","March 10","true","5.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","1"

When I first booted up To the Moon I was expecting an RPG in the likes of final fantasy (based on the graphics). Instead what I got was a gripping and emotional rollercoaster ride filled with joy, love and loss. The characters have realistic personalities and funny at times which makes it easier to connect to them. The soundtrack is superb and does a marvelous job of setting the mood during gameplay. Story is the main attraction here, taking elements from Pixar's 'UP' as inspiration for the mature themes presented. The only fault is the gameplay, which involves moving around and doing simple puzzles. However since the focus of this game isn't the gameplay, it's not a major  issue (it's more like an interactive visual novel).\n\nI highly recommend everyone to play this game or at least have a go.

Sure, I've heard praises about it some time ago and it was on sale recently for a very reasonable price. So, I bought the game along with its soundtrack bundled in without any idea what to truly expect. And after just finishing the game recently, I can safely say that what I got was an experience worth every penny.\n\nKeyword: "experience".\n\nI'll start off by discussing what I think is the main problem that people seem to have for the game (based on the negative Steam reviews).\nThis game is labeled as an "Indie Adventure Role Playing Game". It was also designed through the RPG Maker XP engine. So it is of no surprise that people expect at least a bit of RPG Maker gameplay elements that are typically found elsewhere. But this game doesn't have that. In fact, aside from very simple puzzles, this game doesn't have much else in terms of 'gameplay'.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem. It's hard to call it a 'game' when it barely has any gameplay elements to it. Heck, as long as you keep playing there's no way to lose the game. It's more like a movie with a few interactions added here and there. I personally expected a bit of a challenge too but the game was too easy and too linear. But is that necessarily a bad thing?\n\nNo. In my opinion, it's not.\n\nIn fact, because of how straightforward the gameplay is, I was able to progress through the story very quickly in anticipation for what's going to happen next. All I had to do was overcome a bit of a hurdle in order to progress through the story and it didn't bother me at all.\n\nThat is why I prefer calling it an 'experience' as opposed to calling it a 'game'. It is a  story-driven experience. The lack of any complicated gameplay made all the other aspects of the game shine.\n\nThe graphics may be your typical RPG Maker stuff, but it's better-looking than most of the games made through the RPG Maker engine.\n\nThe story...well, without spoiling much let's just say that there are a lot of feels found in this game. One minute I'm laughing at the interactions between the two main characters, and the next minute I'm trying my best to hold back my tears from too much feels (and most of the time failing to hold back said tears; no shame in that).\n\nAnd the music? Oh man, the music...the music in this game is arguably its greatest asset. The music found in the game is very beautiful. Each soundtrack served its purpose in making every scene of the game much more enjoyable and memorable. If you buy the game, I implore you to buy the soundtrack as well. It's worth it.\n\nIt's a short game; only took me around 4 hours to finish. But every second of that 4 hours was worth it. It was a short but sweet ride.\n\nI highly recommend this game.","February 16, 2015","true","4.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's more of a point and click game with the occasional puzzle which gets harder as the game progresses, but it's nothing too mind numbing. What I love about this game is also the comedic relief from the male doctor you play, so it's a good balance of sadness and humour.

Contains simple animations but good, good lighting and awesome OST.\n\nHowever this game lacks in one thing for me - but inst very important though - the gameplay, it has some bugs like, get stuck on tree, start flying in mid game its not very important but a bit annoying. Also don't expect lot of action in To The Moon.\n\nTalking about To The Moon, on this game we control 2 characters, Drº Neil and Drª Eva that both work on company called  "Sigmund Agency of Life Generation", and the goal of that company is to grant people with low prospect of living.\n\nNow through a machine, Drº Neil and Drª Eva, step into people memory and change them and help they fulfill their wishes. By the game name, To The Moon, we can see what would be the wish they would make. John - main character - wants to go the moon and they will help him.\n\nNow when we are traveling through  John memories we need to pick up some objects to link some memories.\n\nIn perfect game we need a perfect OST, and guess what? We have a extremely good one! Sometimes i would left the game ruining on backgroud just to hear the awesome OST.\n\nNow you want a game with good story? Excellent OST? Great story lines?

Every detail throughout the game is well planned, every mystery has a great payoff, it all connects brilliantly and the dialogue (Text only, no voice acting) is really good.\n\nOverall, you play as 2 scientists who alter dying people's memories to fulfill a wish for them (or, at least, make them believe it came true). In this case, they're out to help an old man called John H. Wyles, who's dying wish is to go (you guessed it) to the moon. What makes this case a bit different to their normal ones is that Johnny hasn't the faintest idea as to why he even wants that. He just knows he does.\n\nThe game's divided into 3 acts. The first one is mostly about establishing the backstory and leanring about Johnny's life. It's pretty slow paced, and mostly sets up questions to be answered later. The 2nd act picks up the pace, and from there till the end I found the game hard to stop playing.\n\nIt takes a bit over 3 hours to finish, so I recommend finishing it in 1 sitting for maximum impact.","January 1, 2015","true","7.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bonnup/recommended/206440/","bonnup","bonnup","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bonnup/","264 products in account","To the Moon is one of those works whose very nature places it at a disadvantage. Like a kicker on an American Football team, this genre (which is most satisfactorially described as an "interactive experience") is not comparable to its peers since it doesn't do the same thing they do. But in all fairness its peers likewise cannot match what it does, and you'd better believe it does plenty!\n\nThe Negs --\nThis title catches you off-guard, withholding the real meat of the gameplay until about 30 minutes in. And even then, that gameplay meat is lean-sliced turkey over a bagel at best. The "interactor" (rather than "player") functions to only move characters from one cutscene to the next. To the Moon could be outright categorized as a point-and-click game if it weren't for the RPG presentation it offers. The story mechanics are sometimes inconsistent, making the goals unclear, which is especially frustrating when all you want to do is get the characters to the next scene of dialogue. This frustration is not extensive though. There were some bugs in places, and sometimes the ground was just too cluttered with vague textures. Quite literally I continually thought the game was freezing on me simply because my character stopped walking when in reality a small flower, not so different in appearance from another small flower that I walk right over, was just blocking my way. The faults of the gameplay were highly bearable, however, mainly because the gameplay was a minor part of this experience.\n\nThe Pos --\nDespite all the underwhelming gameplay aspects, this piece held my attention for 5 hours quite easily. The culprit: the characters. Not the main two doctors - I knew about them. What captivated me were the rest of the cast and their unanswered stories. The writing in this game is keen and well-paced, playing coy about the questions it introduces while not leaving the interactor lost for too long. The dialogue ventures into topics that are realistically gritty and gray. This whole experience works in the first place because the user is immersed enough to accept the story and characters at hand. This immersion is influenced by the detailed artwork, which avoided the half-hearted tiling of textures that RPGs are known for, and by the MIND-BLOWING SOUNDTRACK!!!!! I could not give the ost for this work any more laud than it has already received, but if my two cents count for a thing, the music in this game had me consciously framing each scene to its tone, particularly when the music changed mid-scene.\n\nThe Verd --\nTo the Moon is definitely one to sit down and just experience one day. It is certainly not the sort of thing that I would do any day to blow off some steam; there is a mood for it. So if you find yourself in the mood to watch The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but in a form that requires you to read a little more, then pick up To the Moon (there are actually very similar tones between the two works, and the atmospheres line up pretty well too). As a video game it merits a [7 / 10], but as its own genre of entertainment it steals [10 / 10]. Touching on troubling topics and tearducts alike, To the Moon earned its place as a title that everyone should play once and discuss for a long time after.","June 22, 2014","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I can't say there's much replay value, as it's like a good movie... a la The Sixth Sense, where, once you know what happens, that's it. Even still, if I only ever play it once, it was worth every penny for the 4 hour experience. Obviously, if there's a ridiculously good sale, grab it up.

One of my favourites for sure. Don't watch the videos on YouTube, just play it. It might look basic/boring, but play it to the end and you will not be disappointed. I highly recommend playing it if you haven't already. [Overall rating 8.5/10]\n\nGameplay is pretty average. There isn't much exciting about the gameplay. You click to move, search for objects, click objects, talk to NPCs and that is about it. Don't expect a lot from the gameplay but what it lacks here, it excels in storyline and audio. I believe the gameplay is meant to be quite simple so that more people can experience the story. Even though gameplay is a big deal in video games, this game was amazing still. [Gameplay rating 6/10]\n\nStoryline was something else. Beautiful. When you finish the game and reach the credits, you want to applaud... after you've wiped away the tears of course. If' you're just starting this game, I can't stress how important it is to play this game to the end just for that experience alone. The story alone makes up for the simple gameplay and graphics. [Story rating 10/10]\n\nGraphics are retro style, like something from a SNES time RPG. Don't expect something cutting-edge from the graphics, but they are detailed enough for you to see facial expressions and catch the emotions needed. [Graphics rating 8/10]\n\nAudio is amazing. I find that I'm listening to the full soundtrack regularly. The song, "Everythings Alright" by Laura Shigihara still gives me the feels when I hear it. Amazing voice, and amazing soundtrack. Audio often helps a great deal with infusing emotions into a story, this is definitely the case with To The Moon. [Audio rating 10/10]\n\nInstead of showing gameplay or epic moments in the game. I will leave you with a YouTube link for the full soundtrack.

Also, this game has Metascore rating of 81 which is pretty unusual for some indie pixel art.\n\nI've accidentally found this game in my collection, it was purchased in some bundle and became long forgotten. I decided to start it at least once to see what is it about and reduce number of unplayed games on my steam account.\n\nAnd it definitely wasn't a mistake. The game is a great story, presented in a clever way that keeps you interested for straight four hours. I won't lie - there isn't a lot of choice or freedom in this game, it is more of an interactive fiction that tells you about the entire lifetime of one person, so you could grant him a wish he couldn't get in his real life. You just sometimes press buttons to move to the next story point, but it is nicely told, gives you something to think about and with a plot twist.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tzumainn/recommended/206440/","tzumainn","tzumainn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tzumainn/","69 products in account","I recommend this game whole-heartedly.  I feel like I should say that before stating that I don't think it's much of a game at all.  There are definitely occasional game elements - puzzles, plants and zombies (oh, I get it now), and I'm very proud of the 97% hit rate I got on whack-a-mole - but To the Moon isn't built around any of that.  To the Moon is simply a story: an intricate, emotionally honest, well-crafted story that is an utter amazement to experience.  The rest of this (non-spoiler) review is entirely about the story.\n\nFirst off: the construction.  I have one criticism here, and it's that the beginning felt like it stretched a bit too long before diving into the meat of the plot.  Other than that, the story is uniformly excellent.  Characters are relatable and flawed and real, and they are expressed organically through the story - shown rather than told.  The pacing of the plot is excellent, as is the rhythm of the frequent beats of humor against the somber moments.  And the overall arc is deftly woven: nothing happens in the end that isn't earned in the beginning, and it is rather amazing how recurring jokes such as the jar of pickled olives are transformed into something far more meaningful by game's end.\n\nSecond: the content.  At its core To the Moon is a story about the faith required to have any sort of relationship with another human being.  This is not a point that is hammered in; instead it is subtly expressed in moments spread throughout the game.  Moments where a character is lonelier with someone he loves than by himself.  Where a debate is held over the notion that caring for another can also be selfishness.  Where two people with an asymmetric understanding of each other (and aren't all understandings between two people fundamentally asymmetric?) struggle forward into the future based on nothing more than. . . faith.\n\nI don't think I can go into any more detail without dipping my toe into spoiler territory, and To the Moon deserves better.  I will say that it feels like the story has changed me, colored my notions of the world in ways I can't quite define.  Any game that does that deserves to be played.\n\nI have developed an (unfortunate) habit of including a fairly inane story at the end of my reviews on Steam.  I'm going to pass that up in favor of - again - simply recommending that you enjoy the story of To the Moon.  Here's an attempt at a topical haiku instead!\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe moon is an eye\nAlways watching from above\nNothing else sees all\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nYeah, you do better.","June 1, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/winterdog/recommended/206440/","winterdog","WinterDog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/winterdog/","178 products in account","To the Moon is a very nice game. Speaking about the genre, it is simple linear quest; speaking about the game itself it is wonderful, sometimes funny and sometimes very touching interactive story. Many people describe it as "visual novel", and I totally agree with that. This is the case when saying "you should play it by yourself" is the best recommendation you can give. Describing the story would ruin the experience; the gameplay mechanics are very simplistic, you can't really say anything about it. Click here, click there, read the dialogs, solve primitive puzzle, move on.\n\nWhat makes me recommend this game are the emotions it gives. Beautiful pixel-art, awesome and very atmospheric soundtrack, very exciting story, bringing tears to the eyes at some moments. You probably won't play that game twice, but the first walkthrough will be unforgettable.\n\nTo be objective, here are some cons:\n\n- The game has no graphic options (or any options, actually) and it runs with fixed resolution and aspect ratio of 4x3 (as far as I can tell). So on a widescreen monitor you'll have big black areas on both sides. Considering its pixel-art style that's very minor issue though.\n\n- Some parts of the game seemed to me a little overextended and tedious. But they are rare, and taking into consideration that you can finish the whole game in 3 hours, it is fine.\n\n- Controls are not very responsive and sometimes feels a little bit inaccurate. That is actually the only part of the game that frustrated me a little. But again, it isn't huge problem - the game is short and as far as I know you can't lose, so that is minor complaint as well.\n\n- The game is a little bit pricey for its length and amount of content. I would recommend to buy it with at least 50% discount.\n\n- I've heard about not so great English texts and characters' style of speech. Can't say anything about it because I played the Russian version of the game. But I must say the Russian localization is acceptable at best. I've described my impressions on it in detail below for the Russian users. I'm sure the original version should not be worse than that. :-)\n\nI highly recommend this game, if you are searching for a touching story for one evening.\n\n------------------------------\n\nTo the Moon - очень милая игра. По жанру это простенький линейный квест, а по сути - удивительная, очень интересная и местами забавная, местами невероятно трогательная интерактивная история. Многие называют её "визуальным романом", и с этим определением трудно поспорить. Это тот самый случай, когда фраза "в это надо играть" подходит лучше всего. Описывать сюжет - только портить впечатления, механика игры простейшая, по ней тоже сказать нечего. Кликаешь сюда, кликаешь туда, читаешь диалог, решаешь примитивный пазл, идёшь дальше.\n\nЧто заставляет меня рекомендовать эту игру - так это эмоции, которые она дарит. Красивый пиксель-арт, очень красивая и атмосферная музыка, действительно захватывающий и порой вызывающий ком в горле сюжет. Такую игру вряд ли будешь перепроходить, но первое прохождение оставляет очень сильные впечатления.\n\nЧтобы быть объективным, перечислю минусы:\n\n- В игре нет графических настроек (как и вообще каких-либо настроек), и работает она при этом с фиксированным разрешением и в соотношении сторон 4х3 (насколько я понял). Следовательно, на широкоформатном экране вы получите большие чёрные области по бокам. Учитывая графический стиль (пиксель-арт), это мелочь.\n\n- Некоторые эпизоды игры мне показались немного затянутыми и скучноватыми. Таких моментов немного, а принимая во внимание, что игру можно пройти за 3 часа, это тоже простительно.\n\n- Управление не очень чёткое, временами какое-то неинформативное. Это единственная часть игры, которая меня действительно немного напрягала от начала и до самого конца. Но, опять же, игра короткая, и, насколько я знаю, в ней нельзя каким-то образом проиграть, поэтому это также несущественная проблема.\n\n- Принимая во внимание небольшое время прохождения и отсутствие реиграбельности, игра дороговата. Я бы советовал приобретать её как минимум с 50%-й (а лучше 75%-й) скидкой.\n\n- Русская локализация. Такое ощущение, что перевод, сделанный фанатом игры, был скачан с торрент-трекера. Куча жаргона, совершенно не к месту используемый мат (где-то закрытый сим$%#ами, где-то нет), регулярные ошибки, местами абсолютно не подходящий персонажам стиль речи... К тому же, как выяснилось, если включена русская версия, в конце игры не дают достижение за прохождение. Короче говоря, если английский текст вас не пугает, настоятельно советую поменять язык в настройках игры (в Steam) и играть в оригинал. Справедливости ради, я читал критику и в адрес английских текстов, но уверен, что они не будут хуже локализованных.\n\nЕсли вы ищете интересную историю на один вечер, To the Moon - отличный вариант.","June 21, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bonnup/recommended/206440/","bonnup","bonnup","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bonnup/","264 products in account","To the Moon is one of those works whose very nature places it at a disadvantage. Like a kicker on an American Football team, this genre (which is most satisfactorially described as an "interactive experience") is not comparable to its peers since it doesn't do the same thing they do. But in all fairness its peers likewise cannot match what it does, and you'd better believe it does plenty!\n\nThe Negs --\nThis title catches you off-guard, withholding the real meat of the gameplay until about 30 minutes in. And even then, that gameplay meat is lean-sliced turkey over a bagel at best. The "interactor" (rather than "player") functions to only move characters from one cutscene to the next. To the Moon could be outright categorized as a point-and-click game if it weren't for the RPG presentation it offers. The story mechanics are sometimes inconsistent, making the goals unclear, which is especially frustrating when all you want to do is get the characters to the next scene of dialogue. This frustration is not extensive though. There were some bugs in places, and sometimes the ground was just too cluttered with vague textures. Quite literally I continually thought the game was freezing on me simply because my character stopped walking when in reality a small flower, not so different in appearance from another small flower that I walk right over, was just blocking my way. The faults of the gameplay were highly bearable, however, mainly because the gameplay was a minor part of this experience.\n\nThe Pos --\nDespite all the underwhelming gameplay aspects, this piece held my attention for 5 hours quite easily. The culprit: the characters. Not the main two doctors - I knew about them. What captivated me were the rest of the cast and their unanswered stories. The writing in this game is keen and well-paced, playing coy about the questions it introduces while not leaving the interactor lost for too long. The dialogue ventures into topics that are realistically gritty and gray. This whole experience works in the first place because the user is immersed enough to accept the story and characters at hand. This immersion is influenced by the detailed artwork, which avoided the half-hearted tiling of textures that RPGs are known for, and by the MIND-BLOWING SOUNDTRACK!!!!! I could not give the ost for this work any more laud than it has already received, but if my two cents count for a thing, the music in this game had me consciously framing each scene to its tone, particularly when the music changed mid-scene.\n\nThe Verd --\nTo the Moon is definitely one to sit down and just experience one day. It is certainly not the sort of thing that I would do any day to blow off some steam; there is a mood for it. So if you find yourself in the mood to watch The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind but in a form that requires you to read a little more, then pick up To the Moon (there are actually very similar tones between the two works, and the atmospheres line up pretty well too). As a video game it merits a [7 / 10], but as its own genre of entertainment it steals [10 / 10]. Touching on troubling topics and tearducts alike, To the Moon earned its place as a title that everyone should play once and discuss for a long time after.","June 22, 2014","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It's sort of... a point-and-click adventure meets a visual novel - and to be up-front, I'm not a big fan of either. That being said, and I don't want to give anything away, this will keep you engaged and wanting to finish the narrative. I can't say there's much replay value, as it's like a good movie... a la The Sixth Sense, where, once you know what happens, that's it. Even still, if I only ever play it once, it was worth every penny for the 4 hour experience. Obviously, if there's a ridiculously good sale, grab it up.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tzumainn/recommended/206440/","tzumainn","tzumainn","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tzumainn/","69 products in account","I recommend this game whole-heartedly.  I feel like I should say that before stating that I don't think it's much of a game at all.  There are definitely occasional game elements - puzzles, plants and zombies (oh, I get it now), and I'm very proud of the 97% hit rate I got on whack-a-mole - but To the Moon isn't built around any of that.  To the Moon is simply a story: an intricate, emotionally honest, well-crafted story that is an utter amazement to experience.  The rest of this (non-spoiler) review is entirely about the story.\n\nFirst off: the construction.  I have one criticism here, and it's that the beginning felt like it stretched a bit too long before diving into the meat of the plot.  Other than that, the story is uniformly excellent.  Characters are relatable and flawed and real, and they are expressed organically through the story - shown rather than told.  The pacing of the plot is excellent, as is the rhythm of the frequent beats of humor against the somber moments.  And the overall arc is deftly woven: nothing happens in the end that isn't earned in the beginning, and it is rather amazing how recurring jokes such as the jar of pickled olives are transformed into something far more meaningful by game's end.\n\nSecond: the content.  At its core To the Moon is a story about the faith required to have any sort of relationship with another human being.  This is not a point that is hammered in; instead it is subtly expressed in moments spread throughout the game.  Moments where a character is lonelier with someone he loves than by himself.  Where a debate is held over the notion that caring for another can also be selfishness.  Where two people with an asymmetric understanding of each other (and aren't all understandings between two people fundamentally asymmetric?) struggle forward into the future based on nothing more than. . . faith.\n\nI don't think I can go into any more detail without dipping my toe into spoiler territory, and To the Moon deserves better.  I will say that it feels like the story has changed me, colored my notions of the world in ways I can't quite define.  Any game that does that deserves to be played.\n\nI have developed an (unfortunate) habit of including a fairly inane story at the end of my reviews on Steam.  I'm going to pass that up in favor of - again - simply recommending that you enjoy the story of To the Moon.  Here's an attempt at a topical haiku instead!\n\n-----------------------------------------\n\nThe moon is an eye\nAlways watching from above\nNothing else sees all\n\n------------------------------------------\n\nYeah, you do better.","June 1, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/winterdog/recommended/206440/","winterdog","WinterDog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/winterdog/","178 products in account","To the Moon is a very nice game. Speaking about the genre, it is simple linear quest; speaking about the game itself it is wonderful, sometimes funny and sometimes very touching interactive story. Many people describe it as "visual novel", and I totally agree with that. This is the case when saying "you should play it by yourself" is the best recommendation you can give. Describing the story would ruin the experience; the gameplay mechanics are very simplistic, you can't really say anything about it. Click here, click there, read the dialogs, solve primitive puzzle, move on.\n\nWhat makes me recommend this game are the emotions it gives. Beautiful pixel-art, awesome and very atmospheric soundtrack, very exciting story, bringing tears to the eyes at some moments. You probably won't play that game twice, but the first walkthrough will be unforgettable.\n\nTo be objective, here are some cons:\n\n- The game has no graphic options (or any options, actually) and it runs with fixed resolution and aspect ratio of 4x3 (as far as I can tell). So on a widescreen monitor you'll have big black areas on both sides. Considering its pixel-art style that's very minor issue though.\n\n- Some parts of the game seemed to me a little overextended and tedious. But they are rare, and taking into consideration that you can finish the whole game in 3 hours, it is fine.\n\n- Controls are not very responsive and sometimes feels a little bit inaccurate. That is actually the only part of the game that frustrated me a little. But again, it isn't huge problem - the game is short and as far as I know you can't lose, so that is minor complaint as well.\n\n- The game is a little bit pricey for its length and amount of content. I would recommend to buy it with at least 50% discount.\n\n- I've heard about not so great English texts and characters' style of speech. Can't say anything about it because I played the Russian version of the game. But I must say the Russian localization is acceptable at best. I've described my impressions on it in detail below for the Russian users. I'm sure the original version should not be worse than that. :-)\n\nI highly recommend this game, if you are searching for a touching story for one evening.\n\n------------------------------\n\nTo the Moon - очень милая игра. По жанру это простенький линейный квест, а по сути - удивительная, очень интересная и местами забавная, местами невероятно трогательная интерактивная история. Многие называют её "визуальным романом", и с этим определением трудно поспорить. Это тот самый случай, когда фраза "в это надо играть" подходит лучше всего. Описывать сюжет - только портить впечатления, механика игры простейшая, по ней тоже сказать нечего. Кликаешь сюда, кликаешь туда, читаешь диалог, решаешь примитивный пазл, идёшь дальше.\n\nЧто заставляет меня рекомендовать эту игру - так это эмоции, которые она дарит. Красивый пиксель-арт, очень красивая и атмосферная музыка, действительно захватывающий и порой вызывающий ком в горле сюжет. Такую игру вряд ли будешь перепроходить, но первое прохождение оставляет очень сильные впечатления.\n\nЧтобы быть объективным, перечислю минусы:\n\n- В игре нет графических настроек (как и вообще каких-либо настроек), и работает она при этом с фиксированным разрешением и в соотношении сторон 4х3 (насколько я понял). Следовательно, на широкоформатном экране вы получите большие чёрные области по бокам. Учитывая графический стиль (пиксель-арт), это мелочь.\n\n- Некоторые эпизоды игры мне показались немного затянутыми и скучноватыми. Таких моментов немного, а принимая во внимание, что игру можно пройти за 3 часа, это тоже простительно.\n\n- Управление не очень чёткое, временами какое-то неинформативное. Это единственная часть игры, которая меня действительно немного напрягала от начала и до самого конца. Но, опять же, игра короткая, и, насколько я знаю, в ней нельзя каким-то образом проиграть, поэтому это также несущественная проблема.\n\n- Принимая во внимание небольшое время прохождения и отсутствие реиграбельности, игра дороговата. Я бы советовал приобретать её как минимум с 50%-й (а лучше 75%-й) скидкой.\n\n- Русская локализация. Такое ощущение, что перевод, сделанный фанатом игры, был скачан с торрент-трекера. Куча жаргона, совершенно не к месту используемый мат (где-то закрытый сим$%#ами, где-то нет), регулярные ошибки, местами абсолютно не подходящий персонажам стиль речи... К тому же, как выяснилось, если включена русская версия, в конце игры не дают достижение за прохождение. Короче говоря, если английский текст вас не пугает, настоятельно советую поменять язык в настройках игры (в Steam) и играть в оригинал. Справедливости ради, я читал критику и в адрес английских текстов, но уверен, что они не будут хуже локализованных.\n\nЕсли вы ищете интересную историю на один вечер, To the Moon - отличный вариант.","June 21, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Between stealth games, first-person shooters and action RPGs, I don't frequently delve into the "interactive story" game genre. I was almost embarassed to put the game on my wishlist, given how cheesy and pretentious the trailer looked.\n\nWith that out of the way, I have to say that To The Moon does its job really well. The premise is interesting and the execution is even better, with a strong plot throughout that feels unique. The characters are especially well-written. Some have complained about Dr. Watts disrupting the feels, but I enjoyed his humor and I think he kept the game from becoming too full of itself. (Whenever I thought something was cheesy or pretentious, Watts was there to back me up). The later parts of the game were mind-blowing and very emotional. The story is great!\n\nThe graphics look old and "nostalgic" (which actually ties into the story, if you think hard enough), but are still quite detailed and very pretty backdrops for the key story moments. The soundtrack repeats itself a lot, but is still very good and always fits well with what is currently happening in-game. Actual "gameplay" is mostly minimal, but there are several special sequences where gameplay is used effectively to convey emotion. Every part of the game strengthens the story in a big way.\n\n9/10\nWear a helmet","July 16, 2014","true","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Your progression leads you to regress through his memories, piecing together the importance of his request and why he chose it. Clever and heart-wrenching, To the Moon promises a bittersweet storyline and a simple, yet beautiful score to accompany it. The game will make you laugh; it will make you cry; it will make you hope for the fulfillment of your dreams.\n\nStory: 10/10\nIt's bittersweet and emotionally-engaging. The dialogue between the characters are often funny and clever, drawing from many modern tropes.\n\nGameplay: 7/10\nIt features the same type of basic puzzle (with increasing difficulty), intended to give the player some reprieve from just pointing and clicking, and acts as a gate to the next part of the game. Not much variety, but it's what you would expect of a game in its genre.\n\nControls: 7/10\nPoint-and-click and if you are so inclined, the arrow keys. Movement is a bit clunky, but not terrible.\n\nReplayability: 5/10\nThere are no achievements outside of the completion of the game, so unless you want to relive the story again, I don't see why you would replay it.\n\nFun: 8/10\nIf your idea of fun is a relaxing game and story time, then this is fun. Think of it as reading an interactive visual novel. That's fun, right?\n\nConclusion:\nIf getting hit in the feels is your thing, get this game. If the game is on sale, DEFINITELY get this game.

But once you fall into the world of mystery that surrounds this game, you quickly become involved in a story that will leave an impressionable memory and have you wanting to reach for the story once again.\n\nNow if you are after action or involvement with a whole heap of WASD key bashing then this game does not suit that purpose. But if you are after a quiet evening and are ready to be involved in an amazing story then 'To the Moon' will be exactly what you are after.\n\nThe only hiccup I have with this game is the puzzle sequence and found that it is Freebird's way of calling this a game. Whilst I do enjoy walking around talking to people and exploring the environment I found that the puzzle part wasn't exactly needed in the end development.\n\nPersonally I love the piano and this game hits all of the perfect tones for the emotions it's trying to set. The music to this game plays a big part to each area you walk into and sets the mood very nicely. I don't want to give too much away as the mystery of the game is the gem in itself, but I promise you will find a connection to every single character that you find in the game.\n\nThis is a game I know I will come back to in years time to come, just so I can listen to its story once again like any great book.","July 13, 2013","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm quite open to games but nonetheless I honestly thought this game was going to be boring after browsing through the store page. But seeing that it was recommended to me and that it's also got great reviews, I decided to start it. I didn't know what to expect, the game starts off a bit confusing as it's premise was very new to me, and I'm sure it  will be as well for some of you. What caught my attention and....emotions was the characters, their decisions, motivations and story. It all got me curious and I continued on wanting to learn more as I also got attached to them, some scenes are very heartwarming and sweet and others are innocent and depressing. The way the story is laid out in terms of memory links creates a very interesting and strong medium that makes it very easy to relate and observe the characters from.\n\nThe game was never frustrating and you'll definitely find yourself pausing occasionally, if you're like me that enjoys a good soundtrack whilst revering the scenes and characters.\n\nThis is certaintly a great game, if you are looking for a great story, short game with a great soundtrack, I'll also highly recommend this to you.","September 2, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The two Docs are helping this old man who said he wanted to go to the moon, but he can't remember why. By going back in his memory and hopefully by stitching it back together in a certain way, they can reweave the memory to allow the mind to fill in the details, thus allowing the patient to die with a sense of fulfillment rather than regret. Except the Doctors have met their match... as there are some secrets that this man is hiding... and they must search through the catacombs of his memories to locate the clues...\n\nDon't let the cute 2D graphics that resemble Japanese console RPG turn you off. This game is MUCH deeper than that. They simply chose to spend the developement time on the story rather than hiring artists to do bazillion illustrations. At its heart, its a love story, about broken promises, unfilfilled wishes and potentials, and about taking chances, and how one encounter can change a life.\n\nIt is a short game, and you should have no problem finishing it in a few hours.

The graphics are simply wonderful and the music is literally enchanting.\n\nThe game reminds me of Chrono Trigger with heart. To the Moon touches on themes that games haven't explored before in such narrative expertise. In a sea of games that claim to be "experiences", only a few have really pulled it off and most have left a sour taste in ones mouth afterwards. To the Moon destorys and prenotions you had about games with story and then wrecks your heart with amazing creative flow.\n\nI feel ashamed that I did not give this game a look before, and if you haven't played it yet, I deeply suggest you do.\n\nVerdict: WORTH IT.","January 12, 2014","true","10.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

At the first sights I felt attracted to its detailed scenarios although the cartoonish style of the characters were something of a drawback. However, the more I got into the story, and felt puzzled by it, the more that world seemed believable and the more its characters grew on my mind.\n\nHave you read a compelling book and felt the desperate urge to turn pages and pages because you HAD to know what was going to happen?  Playing To The Moon is like reading one of those books, there is a point in the story where you CAN'T turn back and you have to fulfill the quest.\n\nThis is a game of mild exploration, mild puzzles and increasingly beauty in its storyline. I felt compelled to finish it just like first the time I play Max Payne, and although the story has nothing to do with revenge and bloody murder, the kind of urgency, of NEED to see what will happens, is the very same.\n\nAlso, the game has some funny moments where you can't help but laughing hard (I did it and it was 2 A.M.!). Last but not least, To The Moon is graced with an a awesome soundtrack, it might be a bit repetitive, but all the songs fit perfectly in the right moments, not just being a background noise, but their piece of the stroy with their beauty.\n\nIf you like playing games for their stories, then this is for you!","January 30, 2014","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It made me think about my dad and how much he loved me (probably due to his love for the space program). This connection had less to do with the game’s story, and more to do with the design: to provide a heart-rich story that reminds people of what’s important – life, family, and sacrifices for the ones you love."\n\nRiver’s story fascinates me because the story of people with Asperger’s Syndrome rarely gets told. To my knowledge, this is the first time this has happened in a videogame. River isn’t the only socially marginalized character to have her tale shared with the world in a videogame.

One where  you flip the pages to the very end.\n\nThe wording "To the Moon" is truthful in wording and truthful in where it leads. Physically and emotionally tolled, you will be affected as you take on the journey of an ideologically driven man - lying on his deathbed- to his dream of landing on the moon. He wishes it not only for his own sake, but for the women he loved so much as to let her die. His final action and wish is a gift of placation and apology for her sake.\n\nYou control two scientists who enter dreams in an effort to change the memory of any ailing, near death patient in order to achieve their dreams mentally, but not physically. Their characters are often juxtaposed with the backdrop of the bitter, saddened clients they have, but it serves as a humanizing reminder of the need for human emotion in the times of desperation.\nThey don't serve as the main character, but as (you) -> The person who journeys from the start and to the end of the story, not the creator.\n\nThere isn't much of a game here to be had besides a few puzzles here and there, scattered as a movement of progression. Each puzzle serves as a pinpoint of interest in the client's life reminding the player of the human aspects of the person's mind they are investigating. May it be a simple baloon or some pickles, each pinpoint from the puzzle has its purpose of showing how human the character is.\n\nVerdict:\n\nThis is a journey, a story of a man's unattained wish and you must complete it. I recommend it to the fullest to whoever enjoys games for their stories and not just for their gameplay. This is purely an interactive story.\n","May 28, 2014","true","5.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The game follows Dr. Neil Watts and Dr. Eva Rosalene, employees of Sigmund Corporation, whose job it is to fulfill the final wishes of elderly people who are about to die.They do this by using a machine that allows them to go back through their patient's memories and influence them to fulfill their wishes, creating the memories of their wishes being fulfilled for the patient. In the game, the patient is an elderly man named Johnny, whose dream is to go to the moon. However, he does not know why he wants to go to the moon, so the doctors must find out why he wants to go in order to influence him to go. The doctors go through his memories, from being an elderly man to being a child, in a race against time to get him to the moon before he passes away. The game also delves into the lives of people in Johnny's life, such as his wife River, his friend Nicholas, Isabelle and others.\nThough this game has rich story and great soundtrack, it is still click to proceed type game.

Between stealth games, first-person shooters and action RPGs, I don't frequently delve into the "interactive story" game genre. I was almost embarassed to put the game on my wishlist, given how cheesy and pretentious the trailer looked.\n\nWith that out of the way, I have to say that To The Moon does its job really well. The premise is interesting and the execution is even better, with a strong plot throughout that feels unique. The characters are especially well-written. Some have complained about Dr. Watts disrupting the feels, but I enjoyed his humor and I think he kept the game from becoming too full of itself. (Whenever I thought something was cheesy or pretentious, Watts was there to back me up). The later parts of the game were mind-blowing and very emotional. The story is great!\n\nThe graphics look old and "nostalgic" (which actually ties into the story, if you think hard enough), but are still quite detailed and very pretty backdrops for the key story moments. The soundtrack repeats itself a lot, but is still very good and always fits well with what is currently happening in-game. Actual "gameplay" is mostly minimal, but there are several special sequences where gameplay is used effectively to convey emotion.

This emotional story/journey is the central focus (not gameplay, graphics, or gimmics) and is something so memorable. For me, I felt the tear jerking moment coming... but still caught me completely off guard. Excellent sound track. Bravo. Well done.\n\nWill play again when I actually man up and buy tissues.\n10/10","July 26, 2015","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Between stealth games, first-person shooters and action RPGs, I don't frequently delve into the "interactive story" game genre. I was almost embarassed to put the game on my wishlist, given how cheesy and pretentious the trailer looked.\n\nWith that out of the way, I have to say that To The Moon does its job really well. The premise is interesting and the execution is even better, with a strong plot throughout that feels unique. The characters are especially well-written. Some have complained about Dr. Watts disrupting the feels, but I enjoyed his humor and I think he kept the game from becoming too full of itself. (Whenever I thought something was cheesy or pretentious, Watts was there to back me up). The later parts of the game were mind-blowing and very emotional. The story is great!\n\nThe graphics look old and "nostalgic" (which actually ties into the story, if you think hard enough), but are still quite detailed and very pretty backdrops for the key story moments. The soundtrack repeats itself a lot, but is still very good and always fits well with what is currently happening in-game. Actual "gameplay" is mostly minimal, but there are several special sequences where gameplay is used effectively to convey emotion. Every part of the game strengthens the story in a big way.\n\n9/10\nWear a helmet","July 16, 2014","true","8.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A Lot of Feels Story, not a Lot of Gameplay.Genre: Sci-Fi Adventure Comedy/Tragedy Story Driven Experience.\nDeveloped & Published by: Freebird Games\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux.\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Story Thoughts & Gameplay Mechanics\nThe story is about two doctors who provide a service to people on their deathbeds. This service they perform is where they go into the person’s memories and change events in their head so that it concludes how they would prefer. The game is focused on one such patient and uncovering pieces of his past. There’s some interesting subjects brought up in the game, about life and death. About the moral and philosophical questions brought up about what these two are doing and the actions with regards to the patient. That being said, I feel like this is a game best experienced by yourself. It's not a story I really want to get into or dissect, as I feel that takes away from the experience. I won't deny that this is a bit of a cop-out but at the same time, that's why I don't usually cover titles like To the Moon all that often. I find them difficult to cover.\n\nThe gameplay amounts to you finding certain important items on the level and advancing the story along. There’s not a lot that you, the player, can do when it comes to this game. A lot of the game expects to be watched and read, so there’s not much variance to the experience worth nothing. I get that narrative-driven games are like this, but, it’s getting more and more tiresome.\n\nPC Settings\nSettings for this game are extremely lacking. No resolution options (it runs in a 640x480 resolution), v-sync option is hidden away in the game properties menu which is only accessible by pressing F1 in-game (not something that’s made immediately clear I might add). Keybindings can be changed for both controller and mouse + keyboard though. There are separate volume sliders as well.\n\nThe graphics are a 2D pixelated affair, with a top-down jRPG-like camera angle. Music is an instrumental affair with a lot of solo piano and strings. It works well to create a morose sort of weight to the game.\n\nSide note: the free DLC story that comes with To the Moon doesn't play on anything but Windows. It's ok, a nice little freebie.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nTo the Moon is pretty good. The story certainly has its feels and the game is laser focused on telling a tight story. I’ll give them credit that despite being a passive observer for the majority of it, they clearly knew what they wanted to tell. It’s not an entirely passive affair but the most you’ll end up doing is finding items to advance the plot along, moving around rooms and talking with people. There’s some interesting philosophical and ethical questions about death that are brought up as well. Other than that, what’s left to say...\n\nRead the review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","July 22, 2015","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The characters are lovable. You play as the two scientists who assist the man in the pursuit of his dream, and often act as the comic relief for emotionally tense situations. Much of the gameplay is a variation between puzzles and "point and click", however, I advise you buy the game on sale, as its only a good solid 3-4 hours when playing normally without guides.\n\nTo sum eveything up, To the moon is a game I highly reccommend for people who love a detailed and great storyline, while also having a complex and incredible experience of emotions.","March 11, 2014","true","0.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I didn't really know what to expect going in, except that the game had gotten really good reviews, and that it was about going through a guy's memories. Turns out it's one of the best games I've ever played, and probably one of the most well-conceived and well-written indie games ever made. The way everything ties together as you work your way backwards through the memories is put together pretty much flawlessly. I couldn't find any discontinuity anywhere.\n\nThe feels hit me harder than any form of media has since the show Chuck, and it's also genuinely hilarious at all the right moments. One of the characters in particular made me laugh out loud at his clever references and dialogue in pretty much every scene. I love how it's not so over-the-top funny that it comes off as trying too hard. It's just the perfect amount of humour.\n\nOne piece of advice, I would recommend setting aside a good 5-6 hours and just playing the game straight through. The characters you play as are "pulling an all-nighter", and I feel that the game is best experienced in the same way - all at once. I took a break for a couple weeks part-way through, and when I came back, it took me a little while to remember what had happened.\n\nTL;DR: BUY.

I bought this because it was on sale and I wanted to try something new and short. I did not expect this game to be as great as it was and only started it out of boredom. I'm so glad I did. **The reason my hours are shorter than most is because it was played on offline mode most of the time**\nThe story is unique with many plot twists. The company doesn't put too much work into gameplay because it's the story you are supposed to focus on. If you expect it to be a full shooting and destroy everything game, you'll get a few puzzles for your enjoyment. You play as Johnny and has a very quiet wife, and although she doesn't say much she is one of the most loving characters in the game. The graphics are also quite nice in an indie way. You CANNOT play this game in long breaks, it's one you'd want to continue and even if you didn't, the ending is cute so go play to the end anyways.

Quick game but really touches you. I was very impressed how small the development team was and how much they were able to accomplish. I cannot really tell you much about the game since the story should be experienced as a whole without any hints, but I can say that it is the journey of a man's life and how two scientists figure out why he wants to go to the moon, hence the title.\n\nThis game probably could be beaten in one sitting, 3~4 hours.\n\nIt gets you very emotionally invested in the characters, and the plot is very thick and rich with cool details and sequence of events of things that will tie in later that eventually come back to support an idea of the story. The use of the flashback and the overall mood and tone the game creates is unique and special.\n\n9.5/10, very worthwhile.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/winterdog/recommended/206440/","winterdog","WinterDog","http://steamcommunity.com/id/winterdog/","178 products in account","To the Moon is a very nice game. Speaking about the genre, it is simple linear quest; speaking about the game itself it is wonderful, sometimes funny and sometimes very touching interactive story. Many people describe it as "visual novel", and I totally agree with that. This is the case when saying "you should play it by yourself" is the best recommendation you can give. Describing the story would ruin the experience; the gameplay mechanics are very simplistic, you can't really say anything about it. Click here, click there, read the dialogs, solve primitive puzzle, move on.\n\nWhat makes me recommend this game are the emotions it gives. Beautiful pixel-art, awesome and very atmospheric soundtrack, very exciting story, bringing tears to the eyes at some moments. You probably won't play that game twice, but the first walkthrough will be unforgettable.\n\nTo be objective, here are some cons:\n\n- The game has no graphic options (or any options, actually) and it runs with fixed resolution and aspect ratio of 4x3 (as far as I can tell). So on a widescreen monitor you'll have big black areas on both sides. Considering its pixel-art style that's very minor issue though.\n\n- Some parts of the game seemed to me a little overextended and tedious. But they are rare, and taking into consideration that you can finish the whole game in 3 hours, it is fine.\n\n- Controls are not very responsive and sometimes feels a little bit inaccurate. That is actually the only part of the game that frustrated me a little. But again, it isn't huge problem - the game is short and as far as I know you can't lose, so that is minor complaint as well.\n\n- The game is a little bit pricey for its length and amount of content. I would recommend to buy it with at least 50% discount.\n\n- I've heard about not so great English texts and characters' style of speech. Can't say anything about it because I played the Russian version of the game. But I must say the Russian localization is acceptable at best. I've described my impressions on it in detail below for the Russian users. I'm sure the original version should not be worse than that. :-)\n\nI highly recommend this game, if you are searching for a touching story for one evening.\n\n------------------------------\n\nTo the Moon - очень милая игра. По жанру это простенький линейный квест, а по сути - удивительная, очень интересная и местами забавная, местами невероятно трогательная интерактивная история. Многие называют её "визуальным романом", и с этим определением трудно поспорить. Это тот самый случай, когда фраза "в это надо играть" подходит лучше всего. Описывать сюжет - только портить впечатления, механика игры простейшая, по ней тоже сказать нечего. Кликаешь сюда, кликаешь туда, читаешь диалог, решаешь примитивный пазл, идёшь дальше.\n\nЧто заставляет меня рекомендовать эту игру - так это эмоции, которые она дарит. Красивый пиксель-арт, очень красивая и атмосферная музыка, действительно захватывающий и порой вызывающий ком в горле сюжет. Такую игру вряд ли будешь перепроходить, но первое прохождение оставляет очень сильные впечатления.\n\nЧтобы быть объективным, перечислю минусы:\n\n- В игре нет графических настроек (как и вообще каких-либо настроек), и работает она при этом с фиксированным разрешением и в соотношении сторон 4х3 (насколько я понял). Следовательно, на широкоформатном экране вы получите большие чёрные области по бокам. Учитывая графический стиль (пиксель-арт), это мелочь.\n\n- Некоторые эпизоды игры мне показались немного затянутыми и скучноватыми. Таких моментов немного, а принимая во внимание, что игру можно пройти за 3 часа, это тоже простительно.\n\n- Управление не очень чёткое, временами какое-то неинформативное. Это единственная часть игры, которая меня действительно немного напрягала от начала и до самого конца. Но, опять же, игра короткая, и, насколько я знаю, в ней нельзя каким-то образом проиграть, поэтому это также несущественная проблема.\n\n- Принимая во внимание небольшое время прохождения и отсутствие реиграбельности, игра дороговата. Я бы советовал приобретать её как минимум с 50%-й (а лучше 75%-й) скидкой.\n\n- Русская локализация. Такое ощущение, что перевод, сделанный фанатом игры, был скачан с торрент-трекера. Куча жаргона, совершенно не к месту используемый мат (где-то закрытый сим$%#ами, где-то нет), регулярные ошибки, местами абсолютно не подходящий персонажам стиль речи... К тому же, как выяснилось, если включена русская версия, в конце игры не дают достижение за прохождение. Короче говоря, если английский текст вас не пугает, настоятельно советую поменять язык в настройках игры (в Steam) и играть в оригинал. Справедливости ради, я читал критику и в адрес английских текстов, но уверен, что они не будут хуже локализованных.\n\nЕсли вы ищете интересную историю на один вечер, To the Moon - отличный вариант.","June 21, 2014","true","3.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm quite open to games but nonetheless I honestly thought this game was going to be boring after browsing through the store page. But seeing that it was recommended to me and that it's also got great reviews, I decided to start it. I didn't know what to expect, the game starts off a bit confusing as it's premise was very new to me, and I'm sure it  will be as well for some of you. What caught my attention and....emotions was the characters, their decisions, motivations and story. It all got me curious and I continued on wanting to learn more as I also got attached to them, some scenes are very heartwarming and sweet and others are innocent and depressing. The way the story is laid out in terms of memory links creates a very interesting and strong medium that makes it very easy to relate and observe the characters from.\n\nThe game was never frustrating and you'll definitely find yourself pausing occasionally, if you're like me that enjoys a good soundtrack whilst revering the scenes and characters.\n\nThis is certaintly a great game, if you are looking for a great story, short game with a great soundtrack, I'll also highly recommend this to you.","September 2, 2015","true","4.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

But once you fall into the world of mystery that surrounds this game, you quickly become involved in a story that will leave an impressionable memory and have you wanting to reach for the story once again.\n\nNow if you are after action or involvement with a whole heap of WASD key bashing then this game does not suit that purpose. But if you are after a quiet evening and are ready to be involved in an amazing story then 'To the Moon' will be exactly what you are after.\n\nThe only hiccup I have with this game is the puzzle sequence and found that it is Freebird's way of calling this a game. Whilst I do enjoy walking around talking to people and exploring the environment I found that the puzzle part wasn't exactly needed in the end development.\n\nPersonally I love the piano and this game hits all of the perfect tones for the emotions it's trying to set. The music to this game plays a big part to each area you walk into and sets the mood very nicely. I don't want to give too much away as the mystery of the game is the gem in itself, but I promise you will find a connection to every single character that you find in the game.\n\nThis is a game I know I will come back to in years time to come, just so I can listen to its story once again like any great book.","July 13, 2013","true","5.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A Lot of Feels Story, not a Lot of Gameplay.Genre: Sci-Fi Adventure Comedy/Tragedy Story Driven Experience.\nDeveloped & Published by: Freebird Games\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux.\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Story Thoughts & Gameplay Mechanics\nThe story is about two doctors who provide a service to people on their deathbeds. This service they perform is where they go into the person’s memories and change events in their head so that it concludes how they would prefer. The game is focused on one such patient and uncovering pieces of his past. There’s some interesting subjects brought up in the game, about life and death. About the moral and philosophical questions brought up about what these two are doing and the actions with regards to the patient. That being said, I feel like this is a game best experienced by yourself. It's not a story I really want to get into or dissect, as I feel that takes away from the experience. I won't deny that this is a bit of a cop-out but at the same time, that's why I don't usually cover titles like To the Moon all that often. I find them difficult to cover.\n\nThe gameplay amounts to you finding certain important items on the level and advancing the story along. There’s not a lot that you, the player, can do when it comes to this game. A lot of the game expects to be watched and read, so there’s not much variance to the experience worth nothing. I get that narrative-driven games are like this, but, it’s getting more and more tiresome.\n\nPC Settings\nSettings for this game are extremely lacking. No resolution options (it runs in a 640x480 resolution), v-sync option is hidden away in the game properties menu which is only accessible by pressing F1 in-game (not something that’s made immediately clear I might add). Keybindings can be changed for both controller and mouse + keyboard though. There are separate volume sliders as well.\n\nThe graphics are a 2D pixelated affair, with a top-down jRPG-like camera angle. Music is an instrumental affair with a lot of solo piano and strings. It works well to create a morose sort of weight to the game.\n\nSide note: the free DLC story that comes with To the Moon doesn't play on anything but Windows. It's ok, a nice little freebie.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nTo the Moon is pretty good. The story certainly has its feels and the game is laser focused on telling a tight story. I’ll give them credit that despite being a passive observer for the majority of it, they clearly knew what they wanted to tell. It’s not an entirely passive affair but the most you’ll end up doing is finding items to advance the plot along, moving around rooms and talking with people. There’s some interesting philosophical and ethical questions about death that are brought up as well. Other than that, what’s left to say...\n\nRead the review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","July 22, 2015","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story made me feel so many emotions, whether it be laughter from the banter between the two scientists, sadness from the multiple depressing moments, or happiness from the ending.  The soundtrack is brilliant, fitting the scenes perfectly with virtually no lyrics except for the song "Everything's Alright" which appears near the end.  With subtle hints throughout the story, this game's story is just perfect.  The gameplay is weak, mostly just walking and clicking on things.  If you want a short game with an amazing story, buy "To The Moon".  If you want a game with lots of fun features and lots of variety in gameplay, this may not be what you are looking for.","June 9, 2014","true","4.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

During this game I laughed, I cried, and most of all I just had a ton of fun. The graphis aren't great, and yeah, sometimes the controls are a little wonky, but the AMAZING soundtrack won't leave you any time or need to worry about that. From some of the very first scenes to the very end, the music grabbed me and pulled me straight through the just as well written story. I would honestly tell everyone to buy this game, take a day off, and just play through it in one sitting. At the end, you'll almost be a different person. This game tells a wonderfull story, and does so in such a way that no matter what you wanted to happen, what you expected, what you hated, what you liked, you'll still love it, just the way it was.\n\nThis game definitely got itself a place in my heart, and I hope it'll find it's way to your heart too.\n\n\n\n","July 30, 2015","true","6.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I say love, and not "loved" because it's one of those games that will stick with me forever. I've never experienced a game that made me feel so sentimental. While it doesn't have much as far as gameplay is concerned, To the Moon more than makes up for it in its intriguing and heartfelt narrative. It intertwines humor and heartfelt drama under a veil of mystery--keeping the player hooked from start to finish. I'm amazed at what this game achieves. If you're looking for in-depth gameplay and top-notch graphics then this probably isn't what you're looking for. However, if you enjoy great storytelling, character development and a soundtrack worth buying and listening to hours after the game ends, then you've come to the right place.

What a steal. I installed it and played around with it for about 15 minutes and thought it was just going to be a silly little RPG game that would be mildy entertaining. I was mistaken.\n\n"I hate being wrong but love it when I am set straight" - Harlan Ellison\n\nThese words proved to be true for this game.\n\nTo start off, I will say this game is less of a game and more of a story. A beautiful, masterfully told story. It is challenging to go into why this game is so great without spoiling it but I will say that it has much more depth than it would seem from some simple screenshots. So I'm going to try my best to describe the story without spoiling it. It is a very memorable adventure, featuring it's moments of grandeur, happyiness, silliness, and sorrow. The soundtrack accompanying this game is beautiful, yet a little repetitive. However it works for the game. The gameplay itself, or lack therof, is my main gripe. It consists of very grindy "puzzles" and tends to detract from the story rather than add to it. I found myself often rushing through them just to get on with the story. All this being said, it is still a near perfect game. The director, Kan Gao, did an extraordinary job making sure the game flowed well and felt satisfying at the ending. I would highly recommend this game as a short and sweet distraction from the world. It was much more fun than I was expecting.

A Lot of Feels Story, not a Lot of Gameplay.Genre: Sci-Fi Adventure Comedy/Tragedy Story Driven Experience.\nDeveloped & Published by: Freebird Games\nPlatform: Windows, Mac, Linux.\nBusiness Model: Base Game\nCopy Purchased by Myself Overall Story Thoughts & Gameplay Mechanics\nThe story is about two doctors who provide a service to people on their deathbeds. This service they perform is where they go into the person’s memories and change events in their head so that it concludes how they would prefer. The game is focused on one such patient and uncovering pieces of his past. There’s some interesting subjects brought up in the game, about life and death. About the moral and philosophical questions brought up about what these two are doing and the actions with regards to the patient. That being said, I feel like this is a game best experienced by yourself. It's not a story I really want to get into or dissect, as I feel that takes away from the experience. I won't deny that this is a bit of a cop-out but at the same time, that's why I don't usually cover titles like To the Moon all that often. I find them difficult to cover.\n\nThe gameplay amounts to you finding certain important items on the level and advancing the story along. There’s not a lot that you, the player, can do when it comes to this game. A lot of the game expects to be watched and read, so there’s not much variance to the experience worth nothing. I get that narrative-driven games are like this, but, it’s getting more and more tiresome.\n\nPC Settings\nSettings for this game are extremely lacking. No resolution options (it runs in a 640x480 resolution), v-sync option is hidden away in the game properties menu which is only accessible by pressing F1 in-game (not something that’s made immediately clear I might add). Keybindings can be changed for both controller and mouse + keyboard though. There are separate volume sliders as well.\n\nThe graphics are a 2D pixelated affair, with a top-down jRPG-like camera angle. Music is an instrumental affair with a lot of solo piano and strings. It works well to create a morose sort of weight to the game.\n\nSide note: the free DLC story that comes with To the Moon doesn't play on anything but Windows. It's ok, a nice little freebie.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nTo the Moon is pretty good. The story certainly has its feels and the game is laser focused on telling a tight story. I’ll give them credit that despite being a passive observer for the majority of it, they clearly knew what they wanted to tell. It’s not an entirely passive affair but the most you’ll end up doing is finding items to advance the plot along, moving around rooms and talking with people. There’s some interesting philosophical and ethical questions about death that are brought up as well. Other than that, what’s left to say...\n\nRead the review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[wp.me]","July 22, 2015","true","5.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I say love, and not "loved" because it's one of those games that will stick with me forever. I've never experienced a game that made me feel so sentimental.

It intertwines humor and heartfelt drama under a veil of mystery--keeping the player hooked from start to finish. I'm amazed at what this game achieves.

Boy, what a game. It had almost everything: The visuals were appealing, the characters were pretty nice, and I got really interested in their stories, the story progression is fantastic, I literally didn't see some of the stuff coming, regarding the events that lead up to the ending which was a little bit predictable and the soundtrack is spot on.\n\nA little something that not everyone is a fan of has to be the lack of action; this is a "Point and Click" game, so it may not have the best gameplay in the world, heck, even I found it a little bit grindy or boring in the first half hour, but I'm getting used to that since I've been playing more games like that lately.

Thanks to futuristic technology you go back through his memories and try to alter the events in a way that his final dream can come true. Even if it happens in his mind only. In your journey you will meet various likeable characters that are far from being one-dimensional. In few cases my perception of certain individuals shifted at least two times during four-hour playthrough. "Gaming" segments (various puzzles) are integrated well into the story, however, they felt a little bit forced.

Boy, what a game. It had almost everything: The visuals were appealing, the characters were pretty nice, and I got really interested in their stories, the story progression is fantastic, I literally didn't see some of the stuff coming, regarding the events that lead up to the ending which was a little bit predictable and the soundtrack is spot on.\n\nA little something that not everyone is a fan of has to be the lack of action; this is a "Point and Click" game, so it may not have the best gameplay in the world, heck, even I found it a little bit grindy or boring in the first half hour, but I'm getting used to that since I've been playing more games like that lately. But in my opinion, the things mentioned before makes up for it. The game is a little bit short, but the feels stay...\n\nIn conclusion, I'd say this game is completely worth your money, and it's even better on a sale, it gets pretty well discounted.\nI rate it 5 jars of olives out of 5 jars of olives","December 30, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The gameplay mostly consists of walking around, clicking on things and reading the dialogue. But the writing is excellent. The story is about a dying man whose last wish is to go to the moon. You play as the employees of a corporation that is capable of altering people's memories to give them the illusion of having a different life thus fulfilling their last wish before they die. The narrative unfolds in a reverse chronological order as you go back in time through the old man's memories, learning about his life and finding a way to make his wish come true. It's an interesting way to tell a story and it's executed quite well here.","October 18, 2015","true","5.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I can't remember ever being this moved by an adventure game before. Even though the story can be quite sad at moments (yes, it has made me cry), it also presents lots of funny jokes and dialogues (yes, it has made me laugh out loud, literally). Another positive aspect is the soundtrack. Oh, and there is the fact that there are Doctor Who references in the game. <3\nI have had just one problem with the game: a bug in it has made me lose more than an hour of gameplay and I had to replay it, which was a bit frustrating. Still, it was worth it.","June 21, 2015","true","4.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I won't reveal any more to the plot because it's much better you sit through the events of the story yourself. It's tearjerking; everyone's review that says this truly means it. I didn't understand the story fully the first time mostly out of the fact that I didn't exactly understand the side-effects of some medical conditions mentioned throughout the game, Google anything you're unfamiliar with; it'll help you out, but after the 2nd time it finally made sense, and when you DO understand every piece of the story, it just hurts in a satisfying, remorseful way. There's no easy way to put it; if you don't feel ANYTHING at the end of the gorgeous ride the game takes you through, you're unbelievably heartless.\n\nIf stories that certainly make you appreciate life and not take it for granted, and a hint of science fiction is your cup of tea, To The Moon does anything but disappoint. The piano-arranged soundtrack is stunning; I still find myself humming the themes 3-years later, the 16-bit graphics are nice, and the mini-puzzles inbetween are a lovely touch to keep you going. I'm super excited for Kan Gao's next installment to the series 'Finding Paradise' later this year, but for now I will continue to love this game to no end.\n\nThanks, Kan.","May 23","true","12.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","2"

Plus, the game description intrigued me, and I thought if nothing else, it might be a decent way to spend the evening.\n\nFour hours later, and I am crying harder than I have in months.\n\nI honestly don't know how to describe this game without spoiling the magic of it. This is one of the titles I will point to when people contend that video games cannot be art. They absolutely can be, and this indie might well be considered a masterpiece. The story of To the Moon is tragic, beautiful, and sad. It is often funny and sometimes hilarious. It is the first video game that ever stirred my emotions to the point of tears. And it gave me a newfound appreciation for life. Seriously.\n\nSome details would probably be helpful. You play as Dr. Eva Rosalene and Dr. Neil Watts, two specialists who are hired to modify clients' memories so that the last thing they remember on their deathbeds is the fulfillment of a grand and final wish. This is achieved by working backwards through the patient's remembered life, planting the seed of an idea in their early childhood so that their new, artificial life will play out the way it needs to in order for the wish to take hold. Their latest job is an old man named Johnny, a widower who wants to go to the moon. Only thing is, he doesn't remember why he wants to go, only that he must. So our heroes set up their equipment, enter his most recent memory, and start seeing the man's life in reverse.\n\nWhat begins as a standard point-and-click title quickly weaves into a heartbreaking and simultaneously joyous exploration of life, death, love and its flaws, dreams and the crushing feeling of losing them, promises kept and broken, the future, the past, and the importance of making the present count. It portrayed the shattering realities of illness, financial woes, selfishness, and failure. It captured the grief of not understanding someone you love and the tragedies that befall all of us. It illustrates how love is powerful but also incredibly painful and complex. It makes you think about how each one of us is the hero of our own story, and how much it hurts when we don't live up to the title. It makes you think about how we take so many things and people for granted, and the peculiarities of what does and doesn't stick in our memory. It shows us the importance and the absurdity of chasing after nostalgia, of knowing that something in your possession matters but not remembering why. It shows how easy it is to see other people's mistakes in life while ignoring our own. It pointed out how we would rather act than listen. To the Moon made me think about my own real-life relationships and how I could (should) put more effort into them. It made me think about dozens of chance encounters I've had, the dreaded "What if?" It made me smile with its true-to-life depictions of talking to girls, arguing with co-workers, and gently mocking one's friends. And it emotionally wrecked me with its dramatic twists, gorgeous soundtrack, and perfect ending. It's like someone took the first 10 minutes of the Pixar film UP, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, and several classic RPGs and threw them in a blender.\n\nSome of the dialogue and the mental images that followed it made me think of other, bigger titles, such as Bioshock Infinite. Oh, how we love our lighthouses... But the story here is much more intimate and private, like reading a journal that someone's kept since they were 5. The visuals are charming, going for an old-school RPG look like Link to the Past or the original Harvest Moon. Cinema was obviously a huge influence on some of the particulars, notably Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and Inception. Still, this is a truly original work, one that will stick in your brain long after it ends. The story's ability to make you cry, laugh (sometimes at once), and reflect is something few video games can do. It's something few movies or books can do. Get To the Moon, and let yourself be affected.","July 21, 2013","true","4.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Now, that aside, the To The Moon game, in itself, brought expectations for this genre, to a whole new level for me.\nI would have never expected such an amazing story to be withheld inside of such a pixelated environment. I did cry quite a bit while playing this game just because I get so attached to certain things that other people may find silly.\nWhen playing To The Moon, you have to get lost within the game itself, and forget it is a game. You have to think of it like life itself, or as a book that you are reading to see the ending. To The Moon brought what it meant to be a sidescroller, to a different playing field.\n\nGameplay!\n\nOf course gameplay from a sidescroller is restricted by the dimensions in which the game is formatted on. But do not let this fool you. To The Moon has a quality while you play it that makes you forget you are even playing a sidescroller, but as if you are watching a movie. WASD are of course very prevalent in this game, and using a mouse and or trackpad to click and interact with things are also a major factor. In the inchoate stages of the game, you will find that it brings you through the gist of how things are done.\nIt is not hard to catch hold of how the game is played, for there are only a few controls used within the game itself.\n\nStory\n\nI do not want to spoil the story within a review, but I will say that the story is the most monolithic part of the game itself. If it weren't for this, nobody would have wanted to play this game.\nHowever, within this review, I will tell you a bit about the main characters that you would be playing!\nEva and Neil are the two scientists that you will be playing as throughout the entirety of the game. They crack jokes at each other back and forth using anything from puns, to movie and game jokes. They even go as far as to use memes within the game itself. This just provides the much loved comic relief that makes the game so much more enjoyable than it would be without it.\nOf course the main characters do have serious points in the story, mostly when a major event is taking place, or when the change in mood occurs.\n\nArtwork and Music\n\nLike I have said many times before, music will make a game very memorable.\nWhether it be the nostalgic tune of Castlevania's "Bloody Tears," or the ever so standoutish songs from the modern Final Fantasy series.\nWithin To The Moon, lies some of the most beautiful piano work that could be put into a game. It is simplistic, but it is also some of the most fitting music that could go with the scenes of the game.\n\nThe artwork, of course, is pixelated. There is no big surprise there, but there is much skill within a pixelated game. There can be some of the most amazing art in pixel format, that nobody would ever see just because the game is pixelated.\nSome of the more recommendable sidescrollers with similar art would be the Gundemonium series, or the Super Nintendo's memorable, "Super Mario World."\n\nAll in all, this game is a 9.5 out of 10 that I would play again and again if given the time :3","September 22, 2014","true","14.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The gameplay's pretty barebones, but this is almost a VN so it's so story driven the small gameplay elements that exist are still nice to have. Overall 8/10, I'd recommend it to anyone who wants an impactful emotional experience.","February 13, 2014","true","4.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Without becoming too verbose, this game has one of the best written storylines that I've read in a while and it's one of the very few games in which I've ever cried.  I cried in two places near the end because it was just so emotional that it was difficult to keep my feelings in check.  It was well thought out and it had the perfect timing when the dialogue needed to be there versus when it was more appropriate just to see the events happen.  I would reveal what the story is about but that would be a major spoiler and besides, it would be much better to buy this game and play it for yourself.  ;D  If you're looking more for a traditional RPG, this game isn't it but if you're looking for a great storyline, then it's right up your alley.\n\nAfter playing this game, then play the two minisodes in order.  They reveal fun extras as to what happens after To the Moon.  The second minisode is especially worth it, once you see what happens towards the very end.  It will leave you guessing as to what's really going on.\n\nI can't say much more than that.  The soundtrack was beautiful as well and very pleasing to listen to.  I'm planning on replaying the game when I have the time, as it was very enjoyable and I feel that a second playthough would help me to better understand the story more (although I did get it mostly on my first playthrough).","July 27, 2015","true","7.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

I enjoyed every second of the game and found it to be perfect in length for the price. The music and scenery was relaxing and one of a kind. The characters are likeable and the feeling of seeing how someone's life unfolds is a different experience while playing a game. What was really nice was seeing the new locations and scenarios.\n\n9/10","July 5, 2014","true","5.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dominichuang/recommended/206440/","dominichuang","The Wanderer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dominichuang/","546 products in account","This is NOT a game. It is a story that is played through, without much action by the player. Think of it as more of a slide show on steroids where you get to click the conversation along. Very good storyline, I will rate the story a 10/10, which speaks alot. On the other hand, as it is like a movie, the actual playtime is averaged at 1 hour per playthrough and since it is story based, there is no replayability. My take? Get this if you are buying it on discount, but I definitely wouldn't pay a full 10 bucks for a 1 hour game with no replayability. Very interesting note - This game was made using the RPGMaker engine which can be bought as a separate program for people to make their own games.","January 16, 2014","true","4.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You don't play it for the functionality...you play it for the story. It was really unlike anything I had played before, and giving any details to the story would ruin the fun. Just buy this game when it's on sale, and it's quite a nice experience. If you don't like investing in short games, however; don't get it. I beat it in about 4 hours.","January 6, 2015","true","4.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

I was brought to it by the soundtrack and recommendations of people that enjoyed it as well. First of all, it's a point and click game, which can make it a little boring at times, and the controls and resolution options can be a little wonky. The small amount of puzzles were quite simple. The whole game is easy, but i really don't think the difficulty is the point of this game; rather, its strength lies in its story and character. The story kept me going even when i got bored of it, and there is just the right amount of suspense and curiousity in it. Perfect amount of suspense, because in the end it all fit perfectly. I got rather attached to the characters and setting. I finished this game in about 5 hours, so i will tell you this game is definitely worth your time, short playthrough as it is. This game is worth the odds. :)","January 30, 2015","true","6.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"
