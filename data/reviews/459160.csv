I've stopped playing the game for nearly 2 years now, but I do still lurk the forum and occasionaly log in the game to check what's new, In case the game had a 180º turn, as well to keep in touch with some good old friends (the very few that haven't quit by now).\n\nI was for the most part an hardcore player, purely free to play, part of some of the best endgame guilds (Invalid, 3rdFaction, WarSong, MInc).\n\nWith that being said, my review is from a vet endgamer point of view, that went through multiple updates, server merges and even publisher changes (gpotato/webzen, Mycom).\n\nAllods as a game, is a great mmo, it has plenty of content to keep your enternained, leveling was never so easy (those who were around during gipat update as well the lv47 24k gold cap, can relate). There's a very good amount of zones with different aspects to it, and the endgame can be fun if you play for fun and not to solely outperform the guy next to you in hope that your epeen will stretch a tiny bit more.\n\nHowever the Allods curse is the "free-to-play" model it has. It's the worst piece of crap you can possibly find in a game. The company is utterly greedy and will make sure the cow is milked to its bones.\nSo unless you have very deep pockets or are willing to spend ridiculous amounts of time farming in circles, just to stay competitive, this game is not for you and you should avoid it at all cost.\n\nThe fact there is a currency exchanger where you can trade ingame currency (Gold) for Item Shop currency (Crystals) becomes meaningless when you take a look at the racio. All the best and must have items comes exclusively from gambling. Radiant Strongbox sales EVERY SINGLE WEEK, just to make sure you don't stack too much gold, and spend money to stay afloat. You can technically buy it from other players with gold, but the prices are off limits to most people.\n\nAnd when I say "must have", you realy must have those items or you won't stand a chance in PvP and PvE. I'm talking about scrolls that give extra talent points, stat points, rubies, unlimited build reset and stats reset, combat mounts, trinkets and many more.\nEven worse, there's different qualities on most those items (green, blue, purple, orange, fable) and they stack up, giving those that have all these Pay-To-Win items, a ridiculous edge over Free-To-Play, new comers and occasional buyers.\n\nAnd don't even make me talk about runes. Basically, there's six of them, three offensive, three defensive, it goes from lv1 to 13. To make a lv2 runes you need two lv1, to make a lv3 you need two lv2, and so on... Bare minimum to stay competitive shoud be full lv9 by now.\n\nThen there's patronage that increase your damage a lot and costs too much as well. It's just too many things you need to spend your money or huge amount of time on, and the worse part, they keep adding more with each new update.\n\nThe community in the game keeps getting smaller and smaller, after a month you'll already know who is who. I won't say it's a toxic community, but I have to say it's demanding and there's barely any room for mistakes.\n\nThe truth is, Allods always had a lot of potencial, but due to poor management, greediness above all, it never went past the hopes and dreams we, the players, had.\n\nIf you're still brave enought to waste your time in this mess, you better make a bank loan and keep in mind you're going up against many players that literally spent so much money by now, that they could have bought a new car or two.","June 4","false","0.1"," 210 of 249 people (84%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","84","210","249","13","13"

I spent 105 minutes in the games patcher just downloading a 9.02gb file, the launcher also throttle's your bandwith causing eveything else to load slow. You dev's need to update your steam file, this ♥♥♥♥♥ rediculous no one is going to download the game.\n\nYou want an actual game review?\n\nI played Allod's when it was under gPotato for a litte over a year long before the game came to steam.\n\nNew Frontier is the F2P server, you need high level runes to survive in PvP. Runes will play a major roll the only way to level up runes in the game is to buy Crystal Chips from the Cash Shop or the Auction House the current price for 1 CC is 360g.\n\nLevel 13 runes give you +130% damage and healing or -56.52% incoming damage you need about 79,000 CC to make 1 level 13, 1000 CC is $11 or 360,000 gold.\n\nThe server is open pvp from level 21+. There is also an additional form of pvp that opens at level 35 Astral Ship Combat where you get a crappy starter ship, you have to invest a ton of gold, time and parts to upgrade the ship and if you want a special skin you need to spend $$. The astral system is FFA so your ship can get boarded. your faction can kill you all while you're battling the opposite faction and to top it off you can get your loot stolen in the process.\n\nMounts in this game are also unlocked with real money unless you get lucky enough to get one in an event otherwise you have to farm Gold for Blue Crystals but it's at a 1000G to 1BC ratio sure any thing can be gotten off the auction house so long as you're rich enough to buy it.\n\nNow you can avoid all of this if you just want you just have to spend $11 to play on Smuggler's Paradise which offers less of the P2W and more things like you would find in the more popullar game called World of Warcraft which this is pretty much a low budget copy.\n\nI don't recommend you play this unless you have no other game to play or you have a small inheritance to spend. The game's on it's last leg, Smuggler's Paradise is a barren wasteland and New Frontier doesn't have enough Empire players to stand up to the Legue.","June 3","false","2.0"," 93 of 158 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","93","158","3","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmcookiez/recommended/459160/","tmcookiez","<™[-=> Cookiez <=-]™>","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tmcookiez/","177 products in account","Well... This game is basically a modified Russian-themed World of Warcraft with auto-run features.... Everything will feel familiar if you are a World of Warcraft player. You will find many similarities like Humans(Kanians + Xadaganians), Elves (Also known as Elves), Orcs (Just Orcs), Undead (Arisen), Werewolves(Priden) and the Gnome replacement (Gibberlings who are Tiny Furries). However, the problem is just that. What's so special about this game? What does it have that World of Warcraft doesn't? Also, it's Pay To Win, it's 100 Euros for 10,700 Crystals (cash currency). With Crystals, you can buy Mounts, Buffs and even remove Curses on powerful weapons. If you don't have Crystal, it sucks to play this game.\n\nPROS\n1. Auto-quest\nMy favourite part of the game. Don't know where to go? Press auto-quest, it will bring you to wherever you need to be. The only thing that World of Warcraft doesn't have.\n\n2. The Beginning (Arisen)\n2 Guild Ships duking it out while a giant Astral watches. So cool.\n\n3. Gibberlings\nYou control them as a group of 3. Very unique.\n\n4. The Beginning (Gibberlings)\nJune Ruins with the floating bubble. The flying ships which resembled the transport boat system in World of Warcraft's Booty Bay.\n\n5. Crafting Mini-Luck Game\nThere's a tiny mini-game if you try to craft items. It's purely luck based.\n\n6. Quest Markers\nThey have little markers on the mini-map that highlight other quests in the area. If you scroll over them, it tells you what you need to collect or do. This is very useful.\n\n7. Less Aggro Range\nMajority of creatures are Neutral (Yellow Circle). This makes it less annoying to run around and is more thematic.\n\nCONS\n1. Bad Story\nIt's not a gripping story, it's just not the way the Warcraft lore unfolded.\n\n2. Level Limiters\nIf you're 3 Levels below a boss monster's, you're dead. There is no way to deal it any damage. Gain 1 more Level and suddenly he's feeling the pinch.\n\n3. Fetch Quest\nHaven't most MMORPGs understood this by now? You shouldn't need to make a return journey to turn in the quest. Just comms it in. There are no generic speed-up spells so you'll have to play a tedious game. If you forget to collect a quest from a NPC, get ready to run back and forth.\n\n4. Pay To Win\nYou can actually pay money to get stronger in this game. Horrible business model. 100 Euros for 10,700 Crystals (cash currency).\n\n5. The Game Engine Technology\nFor a "$12 million" game, this game has really old technology. It's like time stood still and locked it in the World of Warcraft engine, which FYI is over 10 years old.\n\n6. Lamp Post Issue\nAll NPCs and creeps just stand and patrol the same area. There is nothing special about them. They don't "live or breathe".\n\n7. No Flying or Swimming or Fishing\nAll the little things are missing.\n\n8. Grinding\nThe max level in this game is 70 but it takes a long time just to grind past level 10.\n\n9. Professions\nSimilar to World of Warcraft, 1 profession at any time. You can get a max of 2 if you get a certificate. Tailoring, Leatherworking, Blacksmithing, Disassembling, Alchemy, Mining, etc\n\n10. Classes\nIt's really similar to World of Warcraft. There are 10 main types with differnt names for different races but they are all the same.\n\n11. AI is pretty silly\nYou attack a Mutineer ship to get 3 treasures. They are all aggressive. Don't worry, you just need to attack 3 or 4 Mutineers and the rest won't take heed of who you are.\n\n12. Talent Point System\nYou gain Talent Points to put into your Talent Tree at a really slow rate of 1 Talent Point per level. However, you need a cumulative amount of points for each additional skill level. E.g. Level 1 Bee Swarm needs 1 TP to upgrade, Level 2 needs 2 TP to upgrade, Level 3 needs 3 TP and so on and so forth.","June 4","false","6.5"," 29 of 50 people (58%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","58","29","50","2","3"

Saw it on Steam, thought of picking it up. However I promptly remembered why I stopped.\n\nNothing stands out about this game.\n\nThere is nothing about this game that makes me think "Oh that was a lot of fun, havent seen that before". Its a sterotypical MMO that plays like the sterotypical MMO. Classes and skills are all tweeked to the standard set up, quests are all the standard fetch/kill quests, and the progression/loot system is mostly quest reward and crafting driven, as standard as standard gets.\n\nThen you add in the incentives they toss at you to buy their premium currency and spend cash on their game, its just done so poorly that it feels like its looming over you, rather then being an option.\n\nIts just a bland MMORPG.","June 4","false","0.5"," 37 of 69 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","37","69","0","8"

The mechanics are interesting, the gameplay is alright and the portrayal is superb.\n\nFair warning though: from what i can tell, this is NOT for you if you are a PvP fan. The PvE content is great and will keep you going but it seems the F2P server is plagued by cash-shop issues.\n\nWill report back after I get up into the top tiers, but i feel that it may be impossible to PvP as a newcomer without playing on the subscription only server.\n\nThat said, the game isn't going anywhere soon its had a steady flow of updates since its launch a long time ago, and recently its newest expansion pack.

The aesthetics and designs are really nice, and the classes all are unique and fun to play.\nHOWEVER, I cannot recommend this game if you're planning to play on the F2P server. Sure, make a character there and test it out, but don't invest there.\nI can only recommend this game if you subscribe and play on the subscription server. No cash shop, and no pay2win.\nIt sounds very stupid saying "don't pay2win, subscribe", but that's how it's set up. The f2p server is pretty much a trial, and you'll end up spending hundreds, maybe thousands of euros in order to stay competitive for PVE&PVP, while on the subscription server it's 10euros a month, and nothing else to it.\n\nAgain, I can only recommend this game if you enjoyed trying the F2P server and don't mind subscribing and playing on that server instead.","June 6","true","0.1"," 8 of 16 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","8","16","0","0"

Are the devs supposed to flood areas with AI controlled players, or don't you have any friends to accompany you?\n\n'UGH, fluctuating download speed in the launcher' - Go to the launcher and disable P2P, or stop downloading your porns. In what way does this justify a negative review about a game itself anyways?\n\n'WoW is better than this game' - Then why did you stop playing it in the first place?\n\n'It is P2W and i'm not willing to pay a single cent, as i would support the devs that way and help keeping up the servers and the support.' - Not even worth a comment. Servers, maintenance and employees do not pay themselves, and i'm sure the thousands of worthless steam indie games in your library did not, either.\n\n\nI for one, think that Allods is a great MMO and it does not have any flaws that inevitably prevent you from having fun in it, or that can not be bypassed by any means. It all depends on your willingness to accept flaws. Or aswell just reject them ... be doomed forever looking for the non-existentperfect F2P MMO that you always wanted.","June 6","true","1.4"," 7 of 14 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","7","14","0","0"

Having played Allods on and off for years, I can only hope it does well under Mycom. I feel like Allods is one of those games where what it needs most is advertisement, I mean, the game is not going to blow anyones mind but it is more than decent. I really used to enjoy playing Allods, and I am hoping it ends up being fun for new comers as well, after all it needs all the players it can get.\n\nAllods online is a pretty standard MMO, it has multiple factions, races and classes, and a bubbly cartoony art style that "pops"  The gameplay for the most part is your standard MMO combat, Allods environment and story are what I think makes it great, even with its average gameplay. Really I feel what Allods needs most is new players, and with the Steam release it can get that.
