'Mashed: Fully Loaded' is one of my favourite games of all time. It's one of the best battle racing multiplayer games ever in my honest opinion. However, this is not 'Mashed: Fully Loaded'. This is the first game, 'Drive To Survive', which sadly, isn't nearly as good, with a pretty bad camera and a lot less content.\n\nI still recommend Mashed, but I am confused and saddened on why they chose to release this version instead of the greatly enhanced Fully Loaded version. It was a terrible decision and seriously makes me very sad.\n\nThe game is still a pretty good racing game with weapons, and is still a ton of fun with friends, but seriously, releasing this version is like... well... think of it like if they released the original Devil May Cry 3 on steam instead of the special edition, and if the original had a bad camera and half the content of the special edition. Or if they released 'Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater' instead of 'Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence'.\n\nIt's a terrible idea.","April 25, 2014","true","1.3"," 85 of 88 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","85","88","0","6"

MASHED POTATOES!"\nWhen I was little I bought this title off the Xplosiv publisher and must admit that its by far the most amazing top-down game I've ever played and felt that I've spent my money right with this title. Played multiplayer with my cousin on the same screen and the insults were undeniably the most outrageous and funny ones. You'll get called a dumb cookie crumb and so forth, which adds even more icing to the cake.\n\nYet, the whole sad thing about this is the fact that this is Drive to Survive, not Fully Loaded so there's not any improvement to the gameplay and I've stated the bugs you'll encounter while playing.\n\nGameplay\nIt's all about survival, or more like mashing your opponents just like potatoes.  MASHED POTATOES!  Anyway- back to the main point  I love mashed potatoes , you can mash your opponents with all kinds of hi-tech weapons like the lock-on missile that chases your target down (Only if you locked your target on the opponent). Furthermore, there's the machine gun that pokes the opponent's car with such violence that you can secure victory if used right. There are many tactics. But along with that... there comes the downs of it.\n\nI've noticed that the AI is extremely aggressive even if playing at the easiest difficulty. I've witnessed the opponent cars crashing into me just to drive me off road to my doom, which is a total suicide for just a point. It starts to become annoying because you can lose the match really fast like this. Another thing worth mentioning is the fact that the AI doesn't know how to use the mortar powerup at all. I know, it's just one powerup they can't use, but it matters. Yet, not only that is annoying, but the terrain seems to be deformed or bugged out. I had my car jump out of nowhere while driving in certain parts of the map and while using ramps to jump, especially at parts with bridges (In Nukov and Sierra it's a really huge problem) it gets frustrating. The car either stops at the ramp and falls down the gap which is instant defeat if playing survival or the chopper attack event. I suppose there's no fix for this. But anyway, it's a really great game and worth playing. It's so worth playing that I managed to forget about all those bugs and continued enjoying it.\n\nOST & SFX\nThere's not much about the soundtrack, but heck, it's surely fitting to the theme. About the sound effects - you're going to get shocked -  This game, has INSULTS.  Really rad, am I right? Being called a dumb cookie crumb was never more fun! Thanks Supersonic Software! The voice acting is satisfying, nothing to whine about.\n\nPros'n'Cons\nPros\n\n+Huge amount of hours\n+Replayability\n+Multiplayer\n+MASHING\n+Nice powerups\n\nCons\n\n-Track bugs\n\nShould you buy it?\nAbsolutely! Sometimes it goes on sale at even one dollar, so it's worth it. But if you don't feel  like it and you own a PS2, you can get the Fully Loaded version off the Xplosiv site or Amazon.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:  Original Curator Group","March 5","true","10.8"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","1"

Also the bridge that you can find the guided rocket collapses when you pick up the powerup (this should NOT happen) and your car blows up and falls.\n\nOn Angel Peak i got a bug where the car would clip through the map and fall to infinity until you restarted the race.

I mean yeah, I can imagine this would make a great local co-op game, but how much you enjoy co-op games has less to do with the game itself and more to do with who you play with. But, seeing as I don't do local co-op, preferring online play, or just.. not doing it at my place at all, I rate it as I would any single-player game.\n\nSimply put, do you do local co-op at all? Then buy it at a discount, since I'm almost certain there are better local co-op games out there for the same price. If you don't do local co-op, don't bother. It's not the worst game in my library, but, there are too many design decisions and flaws that range from nitpicky, like the constant PG-13 taunting from enemy drivers, to "why would they ever why", such as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera.\n\nI mean really, the camera might be the most formidable foe in this entire game, either artificially coercing the POV to display all of the racers as the track twists and turns (even in single-player) to follow the track and not your car, so you crash into walls and drive off cliffs, or straying so close to the ground that the field of view goes to ♥♥♥♥ and your own car obscures your view. You will get used to it, certainly, but it's just this unnecessary hurdle the game puts in your way, and it always seemed to find novel ways to ♥♥♥♥ with me as I progressed through the challenges.\n\nThe moment I decided that forcing me through this game would be a waste of time, however, was when I was doing laps against 3 opponents, all of which were ahead of me. Two of them crashed into each other, hurdling each other off the cliff, but I didn't get to celebrate longer than two seconds, since they then proceeded to spawn one after another in my way and on top of me respectively, hurdling me off the cliff.\n\nSo, uh, no.","October 12, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

There are powerups present, but their low-poly models don't do much to distinguish them- I think they're different colors for different powerups but it's hard to tell what you're picking up. The AIs don't seem particularly effective with pickups, but that's probably for the best since any little setback ends the level immediately. The graphics are dated but alright, the sound is neither obnoxious or engaging. I'd like to believe that some form of multiplayer would redeem this game, but if you're planning on playing it solo, just skip it.","November 11, 2014","false","0.3"," 12 of 33 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","12","33","0","0"

The controls are simple to learn and if you can't learn the defaults, you can change the controls on start up of the game any time you open it if you wish.\n\nWhen you play this game you instantly feel a hint of Micro Machines about it as the cars are weird, the power ups are simply too much for a real car and the tracks all have hidden features that make gameplay special.\n\nThe driving is great, drifts are well handled by the game and collisions are also effectively managed. All of the cars look great. Everyone has the same car in each level so its pure use of driving skill and power up tactics.\n\n\n\nAlthough its a great game, there are a few things that could be ironed out to make the game that more special. On some courses there are jumps across ravines, rivers etc and on other courses there are side routes to jumps, sometimes when going up these your car just flips down the ravine (doesnt happen most of the time but its annoying in survival mode).\n\nAs you see my playtime is 13 hours, this is how long it took to complete the game winning everything. Granted it took some time going over events I previously couldnt win but the creator should add a few more tracks and vehicles but each time a game of that track is complete, a random new scenario is made so you can replay stuff.\n\nOTHER than these few issues, I think Mashed is a great game and would give it 9/10.","July 1, 2014","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

'Mashed: Fully Loaded' is one of my favourite games of all time. It's one of the best battle racing multiplayer games ever in my honest opinion. However, this is not 'Mashed: Fully Loaded'. This is the first game, 'Drive To Survive', which sadly, isn't nearly as good, with a pretty bad camera and a lot less content.\n\nI still recommend Mashed, but I am confused and saddened on why they chose to release this version instead of the greatly enhanced Fully Loaded version. It was a terrible decision and seriously makes me very sad.\n\nThe game is still a pretty good racing game with weapons, and is still a ton of fun with friends, but seriously, releasing this version is like... well... think of it like if they released the original Devil May Cry 3 on steam instead of the special edition, and if the original had a bad camera and half the content of the special edition. Or if they released 'Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater' instead of 'Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence'.\n\nIt's a terrible idea.","April 25, 2014","true","1.3"," 85 of 88 people (97%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","97","85","88","0","6"

MASHED POTATOES!"\nWhen I was little I bought this title off the Xplosiv publisher and must admit that its by far the most amazing top-down game I've ever played and felt that I've spent my money right with this title. Played multiplayer with my cousin on the same screen and the insults were undeniably the most outrageous and funny ones. You'll get called a dumb cookie crumb and so forth, which adds even more icing to the cake.\n\nYet, the whole sad thing about this is the fact that this is Drive to Survive, not Fully Loaded so there's not any improvement to the gameplay and I've stated the bugs you'll encounter while playing.\n\nGameplay\nIt's all about survival, or more like mashing your opponents just like potatoes.  MASHED POTATOES!  Anyway- back to the main point  I love mashed potatoes , you can mash your opponents with all kinds of hi-tech weapons like the lock-on missile that chases your target down (Only if you locked your target on the opponent). Furthermore, there's the machine gun that pokes the opponent's car with such violence that you can secure victory if used right. There are many tactics. But along with that... there comes the downs of it.\n\nI've noticed that the AI is extremely aggressive even if playing at the easiest difficulty. I've witnessed the opponent cars crashing into me just to drive me off road to my doom, which is a total suicide for just a point. It starts to become annoying because you can lose the match really fast like this. Another thing worth mentioning is the fact that the AI doesn't know how to use the mortar powerup at all. I know, it's just one powerup they can't use, but it matters. Yet, not only that is annoying, but the terrain seems to be deformed or bugged out. I had my car jump out of nowhere while driving in certain parts of the map and while using ramps to jump, especially at parts with bridges (In Nukov and Sierra it's a really huge problem) it gets frustrating. The car either stops at the ramp and falls down the gap which is instant defeat if playing survival or the chopper attack event. I suppose there's no fix for this. But anyway, it's a really great game and worth playing. It's so worth playing that I managed to forget about all those bugs and continued enjoying it.\n\nOST & SFX\nThere's not much about the soundtrack, but heck, it's surely fitting to the theme. About the sound effects - you're going to get shocked -  This game, has INSULTS.  Really rad, am I right? Being called a dumb cookie crumb was never more fun! Thanks Supersonic Software! The voice acting is satisfying, nothing to whine about.\n\nPros'n'Cons\nPros\n\n+Huge amount of hours\n+Replayability\n+Multiplayer\n+MASHING\n+Nice powerups\n\nCons\n\n-Track bugs\n\nShould you buy it?\nAbsolutely! Sometimes it goes on sale at even one dollar, so it's worth it. But if you don't feel  like it and you own a PS2, you can get the Fully Loaded version off the Xplosiv site or Amazon.\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group:  Original Curator Group","March 5","true","10.8"," 18 of 19 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","18","19","0","1"

Trump","http://steamcommunity.com/id/95rares95/","560 products in account","I own the original version of Mashed on CD and i can tell you it is not the same. It's like a totally different game. Cars have weird physics, ramps as not as they are on the CD version. In this version you either lose the momentum too fast and fall or the ramp edge flips the cars (or your car gets stuck on it). Whoever made this port clearly chopped up some of the main mechanics of the game up.\n\nOn the Tierra Piedra (the only map in the Demo of this game as well), you can find the glitches described above, the ramp 80% of the time flips your car or makes it get stuck. Also the bridge that you can find the guided rocket collapses when you pick up the powerup (this should NOT happen) and your car blows up and falls.\n\nOn Angel Peak i got a bug where the car would clip through the map and fall to infinity until you restarted the race. This was in the first 5 minutes of gameplay might i add.\n\nIn total i think i spent about 100 hours into the original game, i don't know why. It was fun but it didn't have the bugs it has in this version.","September 8, 2015","false","2.5"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I mean yeah, I can imagine this would make a great local co-op game, but how much you enjoy co-op games has less to do with the game itself and more to do with who you play with. But, seeing as I don't do local co-op, preferring online play, or just.. not doing it at my place at all, I rate it as I would any single-player game.\n\nSimply put, do you do local co-op at all? Then buy it at a discount, since I'm almost certain there are better local co-op games out there for the same price. If you don't do local co-op, don't bother. It's not the worst game in my library, but, there are too many design decisions and flaws that range from nitpicky, like the constant PG-13 taunting from enemy drivers, to "why would they ever why", such as the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ camera.\n\nI mean really, the camera might be the most formidable foe in this entire game, either artificially coercing the POV to display all of the racers as the track twists and turns (even in single-player) to follow the track and not your car, so you crash into walls and drive off cliffs, or straying so close to the ground that the field of view goes to ♥♥♥♥ and your own car obscures your view. You will get used to it, certainly, but it's just this unnecessary hurdle the game puts in your way, and it always seemed to find novel ways to ♥♥♥♥ with me as I progressed through the challenges.\n\nThe moment I decided that forcing me through this game would be a waste of time, however, was when I was doing laps against 3 opponents, all of which were ahead of me. Two of them crashed into each other, hurdling each other off the cliff, but I didn't get to celebrate longer than two seconds, since they then proceeded to spawn one after another in my way and on top of me respectively, hurdling me off the cliff.\n\nSo, uh, no.","October 12, 2015","false","0.9"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

While I was hoping for a game like twisted metal or mario kart, this game has the awkward game mechanic of ending the race whenever you lose sight of your opponent. So the levels are all mindnumbingly short, but you won't have much time to enjoy them because the race will be over as soon as you wipe out on any turn. There are powerups present, but their low-poly models don't do much to distinguish them- I think they're different colors for different powerups but it's hard to tell what you're picking up. The AIs don't seem particularly effective with pickups, but that's probably for the best since any little setback ends the level immediately. The graphics are dated but alright, the sound is neither obnoxious or engaging. I'd like to believe that some form of multiplayer would redeem this game, but if you're planning on playing it solo, just skip it.","November 11, 2014","false","0.3"," 12 of 33 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","12","33","0","0"

The controls are simple to learn and if you can't learn the defaults, you can change the controls on start up of the game any time you open it if you wish.\n\nWhen you play this game you instantly feel a hint of Micro Machines about it as the cars are weird, the power ups are simply too much for a real car and the tracks all have hidden features that make gameplay special.\n\nThe driving is great, drifts are well handled by the game and collisions are also effectively managed. All of the cars look great. Everyone has the same car in each level so its pure use of driving skill and power up tactics.\n\n\n\nAlthough its a great game, there are a few things that could be ironed out to make the game that more special. On some courses there are jumps across ravines, rivers etc and on other courses there are side routes to jumps, sometimes when going up these your car just flips down the ravine (doesnt happen most of the time but its annoying in survival mode).\n\nAs you see my playtime is 13 hours, this is how long it took to complete the game winning everything. Granted it took some time going over events I previously couldnt win but the creator should add a few more tracks and vehicles but each time a game of that track is complete, a random new scenario is made so you can replay stuff.\n\nOTHER than these few issues, I think Mashed is a great game and would give it 9/10.","July 1, 2014","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The controls are simple to learn and if you can't learn the defaults, you can change the controls on start up of the game any time you open it if you wish.\n\nWhen you play this game you instantly feel a hint of Micro Machines about it as the cars are weird, the power ups are simply too much for a real car and the tracks all have hidden features that make gameplay special.\n\nThe driving is great, drifts are well handled by the game and collisions are also effectively managed. All of the cars look great. Everyone has the same car in each level so its pure use of driving skill and power up tactics.\n\n\n\nAlthough its a great game, there are a few things that could be ironed out to make the game that more special. On some courses there are jumps across ravines, rivers etc and on other courses there are side routes to jumps, sometimes when going up these your car just flips down the ravine (doesnt happen most of the time but its annoying in survival mode).\n\nAs you see my playtime is 13 hours, this is how long it took to complete the game winning everything. Granted it took some time going over events I previously couldnt win but the creator should add a few more tracks and vehicles but each time a game of that track is complete, a random new scenario is made so you can replay stuff.\n\nOTHER than these few issues, I think Mashed is a great game and would give it 9/10.","July 1, 2014","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A simple arcade racing game with a unique battle mode. Simply stay on the same screen as the leader or lose a point. It takes 8 points to win a match so it creates a great tug of war that can push both ways for an epic extended battle. Sometimes I won in a quick sweep fasion. Other times it swung back and forth for 15 min. The weapons, controls and camera make it feel like a tribute to the NES classic, RC Pro-am. The freeway battle level is amazing!\n\nMy only major complaint is the lack of vehicle upgrades or other forms of progression. You simply unlock new tracks, modes and cups. Regardless of the short comings, if you like oldschool racing with weapons, Mashing has enough unique ideas and solid execution to make it  well worth the small price of admission.","March 6","true","10.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
