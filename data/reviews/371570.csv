"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azure_Fang/recommended/371570/","Azure_Fang","Azure Fang","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Azure_Fang/","1396 products in account","06/09/2015: The developer has now added offline earnings, though they only begin after a load since the patch. I will add findings once I have an opinion on the change.\n\n06/10/2015: Offline earnings are now in and functioning, but earn rate compated to difficulty scale still make them feel pointless, like no progress was actually made even though you have the levels to show for it.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW\nPros:\n- Polished graphic style\n- Good Music\n- No cash shop\n\nCons:\n- Ignores input from X-Mouse and many autoclickers\n- No depth\n- No story\n- No offline progression\n- Progression is a clone of Clicker Heroes\n- Progression rate of an exploitative freemium game\n\nNeutral:\n- Port of a flash / mobile game\n\nGame works as follows: Game automatically damages enemies and enemies automatically damage you. Clicking an enemy causes minimal damage while clicking your hero causes minimal healing. Killing an enemy nets gole which can be spent on hero upgrades or click upgrades. When 10 enemies have been killed, you may move on to the next "area" which is simply the same area with harder enemies and minimally increased gold drops. Every so many areas (staggered multiples of 5) is a boss which, when defeated the first time, drops a gem (premium currency) which can be spent on game upgrades (5 gems), hero boosts (25 gems), new heroes (varies), or healing potions (5/1 gem, complete waste since you can heal). There are also hero powers in the game, available for unlock starting after the third boss for 3 gems each, but their cooldowns, 15-30 minutes for a use span of 30-60 seconds, make them relatively useless, compounded by the fact that they only cool down while the game is running.\n\nAbout the gems: There are currently only three ways to get gems. Mid to final tier achievement rewards, first time boss kills, and blue chests that can only spawn in areas that you have not yet completed. This means you'll never get any idling for progression; you must stare at the auto-game for hours on end breaking your mouse for premium advancement.\n\nI get it: clicker games can be fun depending on their execution. Clicker Heroes is surprisingly enjoyable with its veil of customization (random hero boosts, world resets with bonuses, multiple per-hero uppgrades, game-altering upgrades, meaningful achievement rewards). But Tap Heroes lacks this depth. All achievement rewards are currency, something that you can start the game, walk away (once you have auto-healing) and make a sandwich, and return to have earned more than most of the achievements would award. When you spend this currency your game effectiveness hardly rises, making you feel like you've actually wasted your time. Combine this with Castlevania: Symphony of the Night-esque difficulty leaps (one shot 10 enemies, move to boss, take enough damage to die three times in one hit) and the game is simply not fun.\n\nIf you're going to buy this game, wait until it's on a steep sale, on the order of 90%-96%. This may seem a pathetic thing to say when the base price is less than a fast food burger, but if a paid game plays with the same grind tactics of a freemium game you might as well wait until it's nearly free to justify it.\n\nPOSTSCRIPT: Negative as this review may be, I will not be refunding. I am willing to see where the game goes, and I'm a sucker for booster drop chance. Developer got me for a few bucks, but other potential buyers should remember that Steam now allows refunds within 14 days with under 2 hours of gameplay on record.\n\nSIDENOTE: At this time, the developer is pushing another idle game on Greenlight; take that as you will.","June 6, 2015","false","12.4"," 57 of 75 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","57","75","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zanbuki/recommended/371570/","Zanbuki","Zanbuki","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zanbuki/","275 products in account","When I saw Tap Heroes being offered for sale, I was swept up in the clicker-game craze that the Summer Sale 2015 brought to Steam. Adventure Capitalist and Clicker Heroes were games that I played daily, so I decided that spending a small amount of money (I think I paid $.99) for another clicker title would be alright.\n\nSo what is it?\n--------------\n\nTap Heroes is a clicker game where you click on a monster to damage it, kill it, and get loot from it. You then use this money to upgrade yourself or your party of 3 adventurers so you can click on a monster to damage it, kill it, and get more loot from it more efficiently. Rinse and repeat ad nauseum.\n\nThe game is pretty colorful, the characters are nicely drawn, there's a decent amount of enemies to kill, and there are a ton of levels to go through with one stipulation: Once you beat level 100, the game starts over at level 101 and there's nothing new other than an increased difficulty. If you play past this point, the only thing left is to chase achievements.\n\nIs there anything good about this game?\n------------------------------------------\n\nYep. It's a pretty decent time waster that you can open daily do a few things, and close again without worrying too much about it. Your characters will continue to earn gold even when the game is off. You can also have the game idle in the background while you play something else if you're wanting to burn through a couple of levels in the game.\n\nAs stated before, the graphics are nice, the interface is easy to use, and because the game comes with an upfront purchase price, there's no in-game microtransaction store begging you to purchase real-money currency to help you speed through the game. Tap Heroes knows what it is, and it does it pretty well.\n\nIs there anything bad about this game?\n-----------------------------------------\n\nYep. Once you make it past the initial first 100 levels, you've seen everything the game has to offer other than an increase in difficulty. Once you push past level 300, there're no more achievements for getting any higher unless you set a personal goal for yourself.\n\nThe music is alright to begin with, but it quickly gets old after a few levels because it's the only music track in the game.\n\nThe game is also very minimalistic compared to other clicker titles. There are no special gimmicks, no hard resets that boost your powers, just pumping money into making your heroes stronger over and over and over. It's a game that's easy to get bored with.\n\nLet's talk about the achievements.\n--------------------------------------------------\n\nThe game comes with 50 of them, and you'll earn most of them over the course of just playing the game. There are a few, however, that will require a substantial amount of effort to attain, one of which I'm still working on after pumping over 200 hours into it (Kill a million monsters). To 100% this game in any reasonable amount of time, you're going to have to simply leave the game running in the background night and day for weeks. You'll also probably want to get a free auto-clicker program at some point. Another achievement, Click 250,000 times, is going to kill your mouse, your wrist, or both.\n\nDespite a couple of ridiculous achievements, getting most of the achievements will give you a sense of "Hey, I've completed this game and squeezed every bit of substance I can out of it", which is what any set of achievements should set out to do.\n\nSo, overall, do I recommend Tap Heroes?\n-------------------------------------------\n\nFor the most part, I'd say yes, but only if you're going to pick it up when it's discounted. It's fun for a time, and I've definitely gotten more out of it than the initial dollar I spent on it, but it'll quickly wear on you if you try to play it for extended periods of time. It's simple and minimalistic, and that's probably a good thing for some, but I know myself and others who have had experience with other clicker titles were left wanting a little more variety and options. At this point, I'm only playing the game to 100% it and then I'll probably never open the application again.\n\nI wish I could choose something in-between the yes and no recommendations, because that's where the game falls. It's not great, but it's not terrible either.","January 14","true","307.1"," 34 of 40 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","34","40","0","0"

But it's very strange to not have any idle gold farming in an idle game,  You literally need to leave the game running in the background to farm gold.  As bad as that may be, I can live with that.\n\nThe progression in-game is painfully slow.  Upgrading an ability that performs every 2.77 seconds and it becomes 2.76 seconds, is very annoyingly slow but eventually I assume things will start to get exciting, right?\n\nThe game lacks steam cloud so your game save is only local to your computer, which makes it a whole lot less appealing to me,  With something like AdVenture Capitalist, I feel like once you start your game, it's like you are playing the game at all times no matter if you want to or not, and if you ever check back in you have been progressing at least a little bit.  Without idle farming and steam cloud, this is basically a clicker game for that one computer you are on and that one game save on your hard drive, and you have to manually find the save file and back it up somewhere if you have put in a lot of hours, this whole idea was not well thought out.  But y'know what, I can sort of live with all of these flaws and just take it at face value.\n\nThere is one advantage of this game over Clicker Heroes and that is there is no easy import/export feature.  I found that annoying in Clicker Heroes: some achievements take 6-12 months of hard work to get and a huge percentage of people are just loading up a game save that is completed and they instantly unlock the whole game's achievements at once.  This makes the absolutely rarest achievements in the game slightly less desirable, since over 1% of the userbase has them already (those punks!).  In Tap Heroes, at least as of right now, the achievements which require tons of hard work are still hard to obtain, so there is a bit of desirability to put in some effort to get them all.\n\nSo what's the deal breaker for me?  It seems to be coded by morons.  The gold drop system is absolutely rediculous.  If you are on, say, level 39, you get like 50 gold per enemy and it takes like a whole minute (or more) to kill him.  If you play on level 12, you get 25 gold per enemy and it takes you 1-2 seconds to kill him.  So making like 10-20x as much gold because you are on the easier levels?   What?  So...?   The whole way to succeed in this game is be playing on a level where you can beat the enemies as fast as possible NOT progress to the highest level you can.  It's mistakes like this which make it blaringly obvious (if it wasn't already) that this game is a rip-off clone without any thought or effort put in.  Did they even play it?\n\nForgot to mention that windowed mode is yet another flaw.  Fullscreen works, but windowed mode creates this small (640x480) window in the middle of my screen which I cannot move, it is borderless so it has no minimize buttons or anything it just sort of sits there in the center of the screen and you cannot resize it.","June 7, 2015","false","22.3"," 49 of 69 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","49","69","3","3"

Each of the three heroes (that you need to unlock) has a different set of attributes and can vary your 'tactic' (I use the term in quotes because in the end it boils down to one factor to progress) by investing in certain attributes. The graphics have a nice cardboard/pixel look and the music is nice.\n\nIs the game worth three bucks then? Not really. The initial variety stops pretty fast and you run out of new things to unlock (which is the whole point of a clicker game) quickly. There's also only one real factor to winning boss fights and that eliminates the possible different approaches to play the game. There are so many clicker games around and they bring a lot more to the table for free(...mium).\n\nIf you really like the graphics and don't mind a rather limited game experience (even for a clicker), wait for a sale or for it to show up in a bundle.","August 4, 2015","false","40.5"," 24 of 30 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","24","30","2","0"

It brings some fresh ideas like healing clicks, auto level forward, flooding powerup and a linear playthrough without any ascensions. At all it's a very simplified and basic gamesetting. The unique leveldesign is somekind of stage for a puppet show. You have maximal just 3 heroes: the warrior, the mage (autohealer) and the rogue (archer). additional you can buy a banker (gold increasing) and a pet (also fighting for you). Compared to other clicker games you just  have to beat 300 zones which can be done quickly. All the main bosses are between level 0 and 100.\n\nBut now comes the bad part: Reffering to the lean gameplay instead you have to grind a lot for some nasty achievements, like to defeat 1M enemies, to tap 250k times, levelup altogether 5k times. After sacrificing a mouse on Clicker Heroes I don't understand why to do it for this little game again. Those achievements are obviously oversized.\n\nAnother discussion is that Tap heroes is just a port of a free online / mobile game and costs incredible 3 EUR on Steam. I got it in a bundle so I don't bother with it much. But for the most ppl who bought it the normal way in Steamstore it could be a ripoff. Besides that it has a big quality issue which cannot explain the price as well. The native resolution is set to 640x480 or something and can only be upscaled to 1080p. Why not bring out a remastered HD version for PC with better resolution which doesn't washes all existing graphics into blur ...","August 1, 2015","true","45.0"," 25 of 34 people (74%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","74","25","34","2","3"

Teenage angst in your eyes as you reach forward to grab a set of dice and hope that you roll high enough to stop the least liked kid in your group... Jimbo.. dressed up in his high priced ogre costume.  You let the dice fly and.... ahh fiddle sticks.. he got the best of you this time..\n\nI can still remember my days playing Dungeons and Dragons, my many days picking up rpg's of days gone past, the Final Fantasies, the Breath of Fires... Dragon Warriors.. well this game is nothing like them, in fact the only thing it has in common with those games or a fun game are the main characters..  Warrior, mage and Thief..\n\nWhat can be said about Tap Heroes... well the first thing that comes to mind is this game can be found elsewhere for free.  The idea behind the game has been done to death lately, the only difference between this game and those games are.. this game will cost you 3 dollars, while the other games like Clickr Heroes are absolutely free to play.\n\nSo surely for paying money you get a more well thought out and polished game?  To answer that question is NO!  Tap Heroes manages to offer less content than you'd get in one for the F2P idling games on steam.  While the other game gives numerous heroes or characters to buy, this game offers you a very generic three characters..  The Warrior, The Mage and the Thief, sure they are the cornerstone of any RPG, this game isn't an RPG it's an Idle game.\n\nEverything about this game seems to pale in comparison to the free alternates out there... This game in a nutshell is this... buy upgrades, click on enemies for the first 10 levels, then never click again as your weak clicks don't even make the enemies break a sweat and the warrior is already doing 10 times your click damage by level 5.  This game lacks any bells and whistles, no skills for your characters..  you get 6 major spells which you the player can cast,, they are your run of the mill fair, more clicks per second, more gold, wash away an enemy, etc etc etc...  nothing special..\n\nSo with all this negative surely a game you pay for has some positives to it?  Well yes, Tap Heroes is set up like an old fashion puppet show you'd put on by cutting out some paper characters, pasting them to a Popsicle stick and set inside a cardboard box.  That alone is pretty unique, also the enemies aren't really as repetitive as the other clicker/idle games, I was surprised to see how many unique enemies the game actually had..  Last but certainly not least is the inclusion of trading cards..  All of which are unlocked for the low price of 3 dollars, unlike the 10 or more you'd need to spend on those other clicker/idle games for cards.\n\nIs this game worth the money..  the honest answer is no, other free games do what this game does... only better.. The only way and I do mean only way I'd recommend this game is if you could get it for under .50 cent, this way you can sell the cards and the game will be free, like it should have been in the first place..","December 15, 2015","false","17.4"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","67","31","46","5","0"

While most of them are free-to-play, Tap Heroes comes with a small up-front cost.\n\nGraphics are cute: the characters are cardboard "actors" on a stage like in a puppet show. It doesn't have a proper story though so I made it into one. So behold! This is the tale of the warrior:\n\nOnce upon a time there was a little warrior. He had a dream: I want to kill one million monsters. Then he could proudly say: "I'm that guy who killed one million monsters."\n\nThe little warrior decided it was a good dream. So he went on a journey to fulfill his dream. A little hand in the sky was helping him. It would poke at the monsters and gold would pour out of their squirming corpses. Warrior was happy.\n\nOne day he met a big monster. It hurt him bad. But the little hand in the sky would poke him at just the right place to make him well again. Warrior was happy.\n\nThen he met the mage. Mage was a nice fellow who would heal his bruises. They would share the gold and carry on. The little hand in the sky would spend their gold to make them stronger and faster. Warrior was happy.\n\nWhen the warrior and mage were getting cozy, they met the rogue. Rogue joined their merry gang and he would shoot poisoned arrows at their foes. The little hand in the sky would buy him more potent poison and stunning arrows. Warrior was happy.\n\nOne day the merry men would get beaten by a big monster. Warrior was not happy about this. So they went back and beat up the poor monsters of the earlier journey for some fast cash because it was easier than beating the strong ones later on. The little hand in the sky would buy them some health upgrades with the mountains of gold. Then they went back and beat up the big monster. Warrior was happy again.\n\nThey would steal gems from the big monsters and their hoards. The little hand in the sky used them to make the warrior himself bigger and summon magic spells to help them. Warrior's smile was bigger too. They would beat up even bigger monsters ad nauseaum.\n\nThey journeyed all the way to level 700, where a dragon beat them up. Warrior said: "I hate dying. Let's go back to kill more weakling monsters." So they went back and beat the poor, defenseless monsters of the beginning of their journey for easy cash and ever larger kill count.\n\nFor days and nights they would beat monsters, because to stop would be to get less gold and not increase the kill count. So they continued.\n\nThe little hand in the sky would idle and play with his other games. Heroes were stronger than the little hand now. The hand was lonely and felt useless. So he bought the heroes a flying squirrel cat demon pet with the rest of the gems for his amusement. It would gnaw at the monsters.\n\nAfter nearly two weeks (or 220 hours by Steam clock) of journey, warrior said: "Stop". They had reached the end of their journey. Warrior thought about what they had done. One million monsters laid in the mud, motionless, the warrior standing on the pile triumphant but thoughtful.\n\nWas this really the accomplishment he had sought? Journey was at the end and the warrior knew that no one else should walk it again. For once the warrior didn't know whether to be happy or sad.\n\n(By the way, you can even play a free version of it in a browser if you really want to: google it up.)","August 24, 2015","false","218.8"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","14","18","2","2"

(how i play) so how ive played so far.. i figured speed was esesntial. so i invested all my time in getting that maxed. (which is kinda lame it can max but ok i did just figure i would get to the point of the currently maxed now and it would get insanely more expensive to level it as it will be vital for late game farming..) any way back to my story i maxed everything on warrior then worked on his dps and my click dps (his first) so that when im away he could do his best at farming for me.. while i did this i allso started to max my rouge and mage (the mage heal an rouge poisen still need 500 odd levels but im slowly getting there) i noticed that once all the skills hit a point there cost was a set 99 999 or something like that... i kinda hoped this kept increasin but i guess late level farming would make that hard.. i would love to help improve this game even if i can just make some suggestions.. it is so much fun to play. .. some ideas i had (well its a theater.. so lets get dramatic... randomly a bird (paper) or a evil figure pokes his head out in the back ground... clicking on them randomly opens up "adventure mode" well title still to be decided..  where drama takes the turn for bizzare. random boss comes out.. chalenges you to defeat his minions. to save a princess.

"only heros damage"  "no heals from mage all heals turn to dps for this battle time is of the key to win" "not weight on the floor.. so pick up all the coins before you fall threw" "double enemies click the attacking bird while your army kills the ground monsters" so on.. i could think of more. but wonder how usefull they would be with everything capping.. the level could scale with the level your currently on in the mane adventure... hit me back if you like my suggestions","June 11, 2015","true","80.0"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

I play all three that are currently available on Steam.  This one is different in that you have three heroes.  A tank (warrior), a healer (mage) and dps (rogue).  This seems like a nice, familiar setup for me as a WoW player.\n\nI find the visuals and animations appealing as well as the sounds but because I need to leave it running in the background to farm coins, I play in Windowed mode with the sound off.  Although I'm not normally a fan of the kazoo, I laughed when I got past the first world and one played a very short tune.\n\nAs others have mentioned, I would like for there to be a way to earn gems.  This is possible on my Android by going into the add gem icon and selecting "Watch a video and earn a gem" but not on my Steam version.\n\nThe only other thing I can think of that bothers me about the game is how, as of this review, Poison is spelled Poision in the header of the Rogue potency drop down.  An easy fix for the developer, I'm sure.","July 14, 2015","true","375.5"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","7","12","0","2"

As per usual you start of quite weak, lacking buffs/powers and have to invest coins into becoming "Stronger". I think that this game would feel quite at home on a touch screen device or mobile phone as something to kill time on a bus or at lunch.\n\nYou can improve your own clicking abilities or choose to improve your heroes. This gives the game light RPG elements where you can improve the heroes Attack, HP, Speed, Crit. Otherwise your own clicker attack,healing and crit can be improved which is all typical for a clicker game. The game has "stages" and bosses on the 10th stages (10,20,30 etc). You could compare this system to Sakura Clicker in terms of how the enemies and bosses appear.\n\nAs you progress you will encounter a new currency "Gems". These are blue currecy which can be used to purachse new types of heroes (mage who heals automatically, rogue who ranges and poisions mobs). These new heroes can also be upgraded simialr to your main hero. You can improve your heroes with Gems by 25% in different stats depending on the hero which is very cruicial to maximise damage. Gems can be used to buy temporary buffs which include attack increase and drop increase and many others.\n\nDying means you lose all your held coins so making sure you are AFKing mobs that do not kill you is cruial. This means that not clicking slows down the coin process by A VERY LARGE AMOUNT. In 4 hours of afking this game I only managed to get to the boss on stage 40 which is I believe still quite early in the game. Music wise and sound wise I instictivly muted them as my experience with clickers most of the sounds are way too repetitive.\n\nThe pixel style looks nice but on large pc monitors in fullscreen it can be quite an eyesore. Definately worth running in windowed mode so you can afk this while doing homework or playing another game stopping to buff your heroes sometimes. I prefer the medieval and RPG theme in this game over the cutesy Plantera.\n\nOverall for a game that does not have any hidden DLC (as most mobile games have) for $2.99 you get a lite RPG experience with fairly nice pixel graphics.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SmileOnSpeedDial/recommended/371570/","SmileOnSpeedDial","SmileOnSpeedDial","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SmileOnSpeedDial/","628 products in account","Tap Heroes is a clicker based as the name implies. As per usual you start of quite weak, lacking buffs/powers and have to invest coins into becoming "Stronger". I think that this game would feel quite at home on a touch screen device or mobile phone as something to kill time on a bus or at lunch.\n\nYou can improve your own clicking abilities or choose to improve your heroes. This gives the game light RPG elements where you can improve the heroes Attack, HP, Speed, Crit. Otherwise your own clicker attack,healing and crit can be improved which is all typical for a clicker game. The game has "stages" and bosses on the 10th stages (10,20,30 etc). You could compare this system to Sakura Clicker in terms of how the enemies and bosses appear.\n\nAs you progress you will encounter a new currency "Gems". These are blue currecy which can be used to purachse new types of heroes (mage who heals automatically, rogue who ranges and poisions mobs). These new heroes can also be upgraded simialr to your main hero. You can improve your heroes with Gems by 25% in different stats depending on the hero which is very cruicial to maximise damage. Gems can be used to buy temporary buffs which include attack increase and drop increase and many others.\n\nDying means you lose all your held coins so making sure you are AFKing mobs that do not kill you is cruial. This means that not clicking slows down the coin process by A VERY LARGE AMOUNT. In 4 hours of afking this game I only managed to get to the boss on stage 40 which is I believe still quite early in the game. Music wise and sound wise I instictivly muted them as my experience with clickers most of the sounds are way too repetitive.\n\nThe pixel style looks nice but on large pc monitors in fullscreen it can be quite an eyesore. Definately worth running in windowed mode so you can afk this while doing homework or playing another game stopping to buff your heroes sometimes. I prefer the medieval and RPG theme in this game over the cutesy Plantera.\n\nOverall for a game that does not have any hidden DLC (as most mobile games have) for $2.99 you get a lite RPG experience with fairly nice pixel graphics. As far as clicker games go you'll be stuck in this one for quite ahwile before you get to the "end game" I feel.

An example of this is the recent addition to offline earnings which i suppose you could argue should have already been there...\n\nIt does have a very nice graphical design giving a puppet show sort feel,  i would say it fits very snuggly between the two f2p clicker games that im sure your already playing (3 if you count the summer game) although currently it does feel a little empty for a paid game.\n\nIf i had too find negative points i would say the mage hero (your healer) is more or less irrelevant in most cases mine is 30 levels lower then the Warrior (tank) and rogue (dps/cc) and health stays just fine hopefully we will see a fourth skill for the mage, chance to fireball or something would be nice. otherwise the novelty value of the party aspect is cool enough...\n\nI know what my play time says but something went wrong at some point and i lost my progress from lvl 100++ to 30 something, According to the forums this seems to be a me problem only but worth a mention as it is more then a little frustrating.\n\nAll being said i would recomend the game if you need a background app for work and so fourth or are just incredibly boring like me...  But as it stands it offers little more then clicker hero's/adventure capatilist already do.  With continued dev support this has the promise to be a great game.\n\nAdditional: skills dont cooldown when the game is closed or minimised which does need to be fixed..","June 13, 2015","true","140.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

His music is cool, the sound effects too, I love the fact that it looks like you're on stage, with paper dolls, I think this idea is super original, the graphic it's pretty cool, even the coloring scheme pleases me... I just think that the inn could have more utility.\nThe thing that I think is the most funny in this game is Dragona. Every 100 levels you will face a dragon, extremely strong and fast. My Warrior currently has Health at level 548 (4178 HP), and the damage he does with the Rogue's Poison, should Hit on average about 10k per second, which does not tickling the dragon HP. But the dragon in 3 hits if I did not heal me (and sometimes even with healing) kills me, so you can see the huge difference in strength there. Whenever I face Dragona, I see the following situation:\n\nYou, Dragona a elder dragon, maximum level, with  9999kkkk HP. Suddenly a bunch of noobs level 10 appears. A warrior with so little HP that you need to force your vision to see his HP bar, in two hits you would make disappear from the world, a rotten and old healer, and a cheap rogue. They decide to try kill you, after your treasures. You look scornfully at those creatures and decide to end his miserable existence, but the cheap Rogue uses a big and op slow on you, that even if you hit 3k on the noob warrior, until you can strike again to finish him, the rotten Healer has already healed all of his HP again. You, not believing what was happening, spends hours and hours trying to destroy those worthless team, without success because of the damned slow. Finally, they defeat you. You watch helplessly as they take away your precious blue gem. And so you decide to take revenge. You will become stronger, and in 100 levels fight them again, this time to win! (and inevitably loses again).\n\nWhat I learned from this game? Never focus the tanker.\n10/10\n\nEdit: As you can see, most of the negative reviews have been resolved by developers, then simply ignore them. For example, the game already has offline farm, and automatic advance. Yes, the drop of money is still a bit low for the HP monsters, but this game is made for a slower progression. Even if it has several features in common with Click Heroes, they still are quite different, as well as the drop rate (is necessary because the game lenght is less than the Clicker Heroes, look at the achievements. In a week I took almost everything in Tap Heroes, and in Clicker Heroes i already have a month playing and I'm still far from half. If Tap Heroes were to have the same rate as Clicker Heroes, in a few hours would be The end.)","June 20, 2015","true","649.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Fairly unique for being an idle game.\n\nThere are some issues with some parts. For starters the gold counter is capped at 999,999. You can get more gold than this but it stops counting after 999,999. the upgrade costs stop counting after 99,999 but i dont know if it actually charges more than 99k.\n\nAs for progression there are 2 currencies, I dont think either are purchasable but gems are vital to progression, but their drops are really scarce. Another issue, I dont know if intended, you dont gain anywhere close to the same gold if the app is closed. What youd normally get in 5 minutes will take you hours if the app isnt open. Chests also dont seem to spawn unless the app is both open and in focus, you cant just leave it in the backround forcing you to stare at an idle game to make progress.\n\nIf you have no issues with having to keep the game open in order to advance then Id give it a look.","July 22, 2015","true","129.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This one costs EUR 2.99/USD 2.99 (luckily I got it in a bundle). On top of that, it has some basic achievements that are easy to get and level 300 is pretty easy to get to. After that starts the boring grind to finish the worst achievement grind ever. Ofcourse the insults to any gamer with a basic sense of real life: the dumb "MASTER TAPPER", 1 handed applause please for clicking 250.000 times. Then there's "KNIGHT" (defeat 100000 enemies), "MASTER" (level up 5000 times) and "TAP HERO" (defeat a staggering 1000000 enemies). Now these last 3 would be ok, if the off-line grinding would be at the same rate as the on-line grinding but alas. There is hardly if at all any off-line grinding. So to gather any gold to get the MASTER achievement you need to run the game long enough to level up 5000 times in total, and to defeat 1.000.000 enemies (to get both KNIGHT and TAP HERO, you better be prepared to keep that power bill, oops, PC running for a few nights so your final 3 achievements will net you a clean 100%. Well done, dev.\n\nUpdate to review (25-Dec-2015 @ 21:22): I've now been running my PC 24 hours constantly and this game for 2 days straight and it's gone from hitting the 100.000 enemies mark at 24 Dec @ 16:35 to roughly 246k enemies killed. At this rate I expect to keep my PC running for a rough estimate of another 6 days. This game should be called PSU killer.\n\nFinal update to review (31-Dec-2015): I just checked, I hit TAP HERO, the 1.000.000 enemies, also known as the ultimate noob achievement at the 30th of December 2015 at 22:53 after having ran my PC continually on this game. Yes, that's right 24hours/6 days straight for a single achievement. I have the bloody troll of all troll achievements.","December 21, 2015","false","259.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/recommended/371570/","genkipro","genkipro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/genkipro/","2517 products in account","OVERVIEWTap Heroes is a typical clicker game.\n\nYou oversee a group of up to three heroes (plus one familiar) as they fight a never-ending horde of ever-more-powerful creatures, one after the other. As you progress through the game your heroes become much more powerful, but so do their enemies.\n\nGraphicsThe graphics have a unique puppet-theatre sort of style that I really like, but which may not appeal to everyone. The game is played out on a stage (complete with curtain and set in the background) and the monsters and heroes are paper puppet cut outs with extremely simple animations. It works well and sets Tap Heroes apart from other clicker games.\n\nThe game can be played windowed or full screen, and that's about the only graphics option. The interface includes lots of nice big icons and you'll quickly be able to navigate your way around it.\n\nSoundSound is fairly basic. It's okay, but nothing special, although I find the attack sounds a bit annoying. I usually get my clicker fix with the sound turned down for this reason.\n\nGameplayIf you've played any other clicker game you'll be familiar with the basic gameplay, although Tap Heroes does do a couple of things a bit differently to many of the other clickers. The first is that your party has only one hero -- your warrior -- who faces each monster directly, and as he attacks the monster he is, in turn, attacked back. The other heroes support the warrior by healing him and poisoning the monsters, although you can also buy a familiar for the mage that does do ranged damage directly as well.\n\nThe other new feature is that you can either click on a monster or click on your warrior to heal him, and you can improve your attack and heal powers individually.\n\nBut other than these new additions, the game plays like a fairly limited clone of any other clicker out there. You can't increase your party beyond the three heroes and familiar and you can only buy a very small number of special abilities to use (and these don't charge unless you're playing).\n\nPROS AND CONSPros:\n+ Great graphic style\n+ A couple of new ideas for the genre\n+ A lot of achievements\n+ Trading cards\n\nCons:\n- It's not free, and it's not as good as other free clickers\n- Attack sounds are annoying enough to turn the sound off\n- 'End game' is REALLY boring, even for a clicker game -- so much so that you'll most likely not bother with the later achievements\n\nCONCLUSIONTap Heroes is a nice entry into the clicker game genre, with a great graphical style and some novel elements.\n\nHowever, it's not free, and when you compare it against some of the free clicker games out there, Tap Heroes falls short in many aspects. Given these free (and better!) alternatives I don't recommend picking up Tap Heroes unless you're a clicker game fanatic. Instead, I'd suggest you try Clicker Heroes for arguably the best clicker game on Steam, or Sakura Clicker if you're into a more 'mature' anime theme, albeit without achievements.\n\n4/10","March 15","false","7.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I upgrade my attack speed and the speed only goes down by .02 every, time. Why waste 1000 gold coins if the difference in speed does not change unless I spend 10000 coins. to only change it by .1 second. It literally makes no sense why this would be the case.

In this exceedingly crowded Idle Game market, it is rare to find a game that stands out for its simplicity and its addictiveness.  Tap Heroes, however, is one such game.\n\nTap Heroes, like many such Idle games revolves around you, the player, clicking on enemies in order to progress.  Or, you can leave your “Heroes” to battle the enemies themselves.\n\nWhat is interesting about Tap Heroes is that there is a “Healing” system in place.  Unlike many other games of this type, your Hero takes damage from the monsters he battles.  Taking too much damage can quickly see you in some serious trouble.  You have the option of clicking frantically on your hero to heal him, or, hiring a Mage to automatically heal your Hero.\n\nAs the game progresses the enemies become even harder and do more damage to your heroes.  Luckily, defeating an enemy gets you loot.  You get to spend this loot on upgrading your heroes to deal more damage or take more damage, or on upgrading your own clicking power to also deal more damage or heal damage inflicted upon your Hero.\n\nTap Heroes has a beautiful, retro, 8-bit graphical style for the characters and is a real pleasure to watch.  The animations flow smoothly, and seeing the monsters wince in pain when they are hit is a real joy.\n\nThere are more than 70 different monsters and bosses in the game, spread across 10 distinct regions.  This, combined with a veritable plethora of achievements and Trading Cards unlockable exclusively on Steam make Tap Heroes a potentially limitless game.\n\nIn all, if you enjoy “Idle” type games, I would heartily recommend Tap Heroes.  It is simple, fun, good to look at and a nice way to pass the time whilst waiting for your guild to log on to steam so you can all go on your next raid.","May 18","true","4.6"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

What's the appeal? My first exposure to one was an actual idle game called Candy Box where the sub-genre of "clicker" didn't even exist. Eventually I discovered Cookie Clicker and was hooked... for about an hour. The problem I find with most clicker games is they only have one dynamic variable (such as coins) making the game completely mindless. This is due to the fact no matter what you invest your earnings in, you will always get the same benefit (perhaps at just a different rate). This is where Tap Heroes is refreshing. There are different stats and things to invest in within the game and you have to be a bit active the further in the game you get. I don't consider this to be a full blown game but it's still better than most games on steam and only at three bucks. What are you expecting it to be? Seriously, it's somewhat a flash port. Don't overthink it.\n\nIf you think this is an actual idle game:\n* There is no offline idling.\n* You're rate of income slows down as opposed to drastically increasing over time.\n* Bosses require some activity.\n* The further you get the game actually does get challenging, requiring a bit of strategy.\n\nDifferences between the Steam and the Flash version are:\n* No IAPs.\n* New features w/ more being added in time.\n* Fullscreen mode (though atm blurry).","June 7, 2015","true","15.8"," 6 of 19 people (32%) found this review helpful","32","6","19","0","0"

The game is quite simple and fun, despite being repetitive.\n\nYou have 3 heroes, a Warrior which mostly deals damage and critical hits, a Mage which heals your party and a Ranger which stuns and poison the monsters. You also have your own "Hero" that can heal your party, deal damage, critical heal/critical hit and cast abilities!\n\nThe backgrounds are well-made and they are animated. There's a different music played for boss stages and i'm pretty sure there's an infinite amount of levels. If you happen to die, you lose a bunch of gold but you keep all your heroes and stats, so no biggie!\n\nI love the new features that were missing from other idle games and I say this one has it's spot on the Steam Store.

The game is fairly simple in the means of how to play but the game can still quickly become a challenge if you just jump to the next level without grinding a little to get more coins and raise your stats. This is a cookie clicker style game in which you can click your heart out against waves of enemies or just buff up your characters and let them do the work for you. A great thing about this game as well is that you can shut it off and the game will keep playing for you so that you keep gaining coins over time. I only played for about 15-20 minutes but fell in love with it very fast. The heroes and monsters are adorable and the carboard puppet design honestly gave it a really nice Paper Mario feel to me. I'd definitely recommend this game to anyone looking to kill some time.\n\nI did a lets play of the game if anyone wants some game play footage:\nhttps://youtu.be/eoHlkAdebCo","February 25","true","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Besides all the skills there are also spells and other unlockebles that you have to unlock with gems. Gems can be found in blue chests, when you defeated a boss or when you earn higher level achivements.\n\nPersonally i do really like this game how ever i think 3 buck is a little much for what this game is but if it is on sale and you like having a game around where you can hop in collect your money they made during your offline time upgrade some characters and leave again than this is worth buying.","February 25","true","27.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The achievement progression is fairly linear up until the last 8 or so and becomes almost unbearable.

I love casual games, and this is a great one! Little effort needed most of the time, other than the boss fights every so often which do get challenging. Boosting powers and hero stats adds a bit of a strategy element, and is essential for gaining the ability to be able to beat the bosses and progress to higher levels. Basically though, I just LOVE this game so far!","March 28","true","34.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is not like buy all the heroes and leave overnight to get loot to reset for stronger stats. No sir, this requires you to power-up different stats to kill an enemy quickly, the higher the level the more the cost will be. There is no easy way of getting all the achievements in one day or a week.\n\nBut that is not the real reason why I love this game. Its simple, only cost is the amount of buying this game. There is no hidden fees or transactions to power-up your hero. You will try to click on your hero to heal on boss levels due to the fact they are OP and can 1-shot kill you. Which makes this a I want to beat that F'n boss clicking grind. That is the reason why. That urge to beat that boss and show them who is the king of clicking. That is the rush I feel when playing this game.\n\nOther than that, it is a simple game that you can enjoy clicking on. If you do not want to buy now, at least wait for a sale/bundle and buy it. Trust me, that urge of beating that boss will empower your soul by screaming it out loud, cursing at your screen. Then the wait until the next boss will be quick and you will know... You will do it again.","April 9","true","70.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The other two, Loot Hero DX and Plantera, do have their moments, and I actually liked them. On the other hand, Tap Heroes is just awful. There is no depth, and the progression is set to a grueling pace. I’m not unfamiliar to the idle/clicker genre, nor was I looking for anything particularly complex. It is this specific combination that makes it completely unappealing. I’m very happy that I received this in a bundle, because I wouldn’t be satisfied with buying this at any price.\n","May 12","false","207.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The games presentation on Steam is lackluster. People who look at the page won't know what the game is about without looking deeper. The video is mediocre. While I do like the design of the game and the "puppet theatre" style of the game, this game isn't graphically impressive. The game play is good. I like running the game when I am doing something else as after a while the game becomes self sufficient. I am not a huge fan of the music loop, but the sound effects are pretty good. The game is intuitive to play. The menus seem clunky, but the game runs well enough.\n\nThat being said, this game is a port of an online flash game. If you search it up, you can play it for free. I don't see a reason for the price on the computer edition when it is available for free online.\n\nI would rate this game 3.5 stars out of 5.\n\nFinal notes: Game includes Steam Trading Cards; bonus points. Game is available on mobile.\n\n\nNote: I recieved a Steam Product Key for this game in a giveaway.","May 29","true","71.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game fails at both of those. The gameplay is even more generic then your average clicker and the achievements are insanely grindy.\n\nIf you are looking for a fun clicker I recommend Plantera.\nIf you want more of a classic clicker like this then just save your money and try one of the free ones that are a lot better anyway.","June 3","false","7.9"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"
