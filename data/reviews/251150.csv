So you try to achieve this by stepping into your father's shoes and start your job as a so-called 'Bracer' - a kind of unofficial law enforcer. Therefore, you start out with your pair of siblings as 'Junior Bracers' and try to fill the hole left by your Father. This brings you closer to him and the mystery of his disappearance.\nSometimes slow, just like a walk through forests and mountains with your friends,\nthen rapid at others like zillion things suddenly making sense, events you thought might happen, come about and people do things you never thought they would do.\nBreath-taking and like magic keeps you in the world for hours without letting you go\nThe WorldIt's a big, living world; there are interesting quests, NPCs and locations everywhere.\nThe NPCs were very special to me - some already know things about you (yeah, sounds blurry, but I don't want to spoil anything), some might remember you if encountered before. I have to add, that I really tried to speak to every NPC - whether he would sell me something, give me a quest or just chat with me.\nThat I did every quest possible (though I failed once or twice - since you always have a timeframe depending on your main questline to do sidequests) was just natural - I was motivated to do my 'job' and help the people of the country.\nAncient towers, beautiful lakes, magnificent towns, military buildings, rocky mountains, dark forests, misty valleys make up the scenery around you and there is even more to see.\nThe CharactersVery different individuals but every one of them loveable and enjoyable.\nThe two lead characters are Estelle and Joshua Bright, with Estelle being the main character, so to say. On your journey, you encounter multiple other characters who will join your fellowship. It was always hard for me to lose old comrades and gain new ones as I didn't know those and just got to love the ones I used to have with me (looking at you here, little T <3). After all, that's one of the things that makes this game very special to me.\n\nThe CombatFirst of - I hate turn based games. The second thing being - I loved the combat in this game.\nSounds strange again? - I know, but manipulating the flow of the fight by using crafts {1} or arts {2}, just focusing attacks on the next enemy, deciding whether to heal or attack when between a rock and a hard place - it makes the turns feel exciting and gets your heart racing.\nAdditionally, this game also features elemental-based advantages, so if you fight against a plant-like monster, fire attacks will most likely 1-hit the cabbage. Naturally this works both ways, so don't think about attacking the water-guys with fire attacks and be wary of their attacks in case you modified your defence to fire. Nevertheless to apply this, you either need the knowledge, where the Monster Book comes in handyor a quartz {3}, that let's you see enemy stats (I used the latter for the whole game).\nSadly here is one thing I didn't like, i.e. that moving your character costs you the full turn, It was really annoying and I ended up using the moving in only 1 or 2 fights across the entire game, which is a bit sad but makes you try to position your characters by attacking certain areas.\nThe 'Retry Offset' (downscaling on losing fights) is another nice feature for those who don't like dying over and over again without seeing any light in a difficult situation. On the whole, this game is about the story and not the combat so you shouldn't rage about it and dislike the game because of one single fight.\nDefinition of Terms\nCrafts are unique special abilities of each character, they use 'CP' (Craft Points) which you get by attacking or being attacked. At 100 CP you can use an even more powerful S-Craft, which gains power as your CP-bar rises, up to 200 points.\nArts are the magic in this world, you gain access to magic depending on the quartz installed in your 'Orbment' (a device for using arts).\nQuartz is made of so-called 'Septium Crystals' (a secondary currency/resource), they come in different elements and strengths and feature bonuses to your basic abilities like Attack and Defence and grant you access to arts.\nThe VisualsI won't call it graphics, this game is old and you can certainly see this. However this is the PC version, so you won't have problems playing it on 1080p, the text is easy to read, the graphics of the faces (only for important characters) are magnificent and most importantly - the style matches the game and enhances the atmosphere perfectly.\nYou can certainly see that much thought and love was put into designing the whole world and every interior. Well, to be honest, the trees in the forest don't exactly look hand-placed, but who cares about that anyway?\n\nThe SoundYeah, this gets an extra bullet-point, because every time I start up this game I immediately get goosebumps - I think that's enough to describe it.\nMoreover 'The origins of light' (or 'of the stars') is just a beautiful soundtrack and by far not the only great one in this game.\nThe sound really adds to the atmosphere in the game.\n\nThe VerdictLast but not least, the game is extremely fun and at the end of the day that's what matters in a game  - having fun.\nI finished this game with a smile on my face and tears in my eyes, I didn't know whether to laugh or cry - the best ending ever in the video games I've played.\nI advise everyone to get this game and enjoy the magic journey of the Trails in the Sky[www.trailsinthesky.com] :-)\n\nNoteIf you have read this far - thank you.\nI hope this review helped you in deciding to buy this game and if it did, I would be grateful for a 'thumbs up', if you didn't like it, you can give me a 'thumbs down' but I would be glad to hear your opinion on what you didn't like.\n\nMy review for Trails in the Sky Second Chapter.","September 5, 2015","true","52.4"," 888 of 914 people (97%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","97","888","914","25","28"

You want more JRPGs on Steam, right? Of course you do. You have your Final Fantasy, you have your Agarest, you have a few others, but you want more. I want more. We all want more. Guess what Trails in the Sky is. That's right; a JRPG. You buy it, you tell publishers "hey dudes look there's a market for this genre."\n\nAnd are you the type of person who sees a bunch of games starring rugged white guys with guns and gets sad that there aren't more female game protagonists? Well, you see that person with the staff and the ponytails up there? Guess what that person is. Female? You bet your sweet buttery biscuits she's female. Her name is Estelle. She's pretty interesting. And there are three other playable ladies in the game. They're all interesting also. And there's four dudes as well, and all of them are interesting. Everyone is really frigging interesting.\n\n"But I don't want to give money to some jerky big-name game publisher. Who is getting my hard-earned regional currency?" Wise up, you dingus; your hard-earned regional currency is going to XSEED. You know how awesome XSEED is, mofos? Really really awesome. More awesome than you and I put together.\n\nAs for the game itself? Alright, fine, let me serious up for a minute. *ahem*\n\nCall me odd, but when it comes to JRPGs, I'm the type of person that prefers strong gameplay over a strong story. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with video games as a storytelling medium (hell, the entire genre of visual novels exists for this exact purpose), but if I really want a good story, then I have both a library card and a Netflix subscription to take advantage of. I play video games because I want to, you know, *play a game*. Because of this, I'm much more likely to enjoy - as well as replay - JRPGs that favor complex gameplay over a compelling story (Pokemon, Golden Sun, Final Fantasy V) than JRPGs that favor a compelling story over complex gameplay (Lunar, Earthbound, Final Fantasy IV).\n\nThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is one of the only exceptions.\n\nThat's not to say that the gameplay is bad; think of the battle system as a cross between Final Fantasy VII and Final Fantasy Tactics. It's fun, it moves at a good pace, and it features the *classiest* damn battle music I have ever heard. The thing to be aware of before diving in, though, is that the game is broken up into five chapters, with each chapter having its own locations, dungeons, sidequests, enemies, and so on. Once you complete a chapter and move on to the next one, you can't go back, meaning that anything you missed is now completely inaccessible. Even within the individual chapters, the sidequests (of which there are a TON, a plus in my book) have relatively small timeframes; there are also a bunch that aren't even listed until you happen to bump into them, including a couple that make me seriously wonder how anyone at Falcom could think that players could complete them all without a guide. While the sidequests are, of course, optional, they do offer some nifty rewards, challenging battles, and humorous cutscenes, and if nothing else, it's frustrating to be at the endgame and be missing only one or two entries in the bestiary or recipe book.\n\nBut Trails in the Sky features quite literally the most vibrant, detailed world of any JRPG I have ever played.\n\nThis game has an immense amount of text, and XSEED did an absolutely wonderful job translating it for English-speaking audiences. Be aware that the story is not fast-paced in the slightest - it's a slow burn with an emphasis on character interactions and world-building. Because of this, the cutscenes in Trails tend to take a long time, like many other entries in the genre, but the writing is so strong and the characters so likable that you won't mind at all. Even beyond the main characters and story, you rarely have to go far to find an NPC with something interesting to say - not a whole lot of "Welcome to Corneria" or "Press Start to open the menu" here. (Protip: reexamine each treasure chest after opening.)\n\nInteresting characters. Vibrant world. Stellar soundtrack. JRPGs. XSEED.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ultros7/recommended/251150/","Ultros7","Casul","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Ultros7/","285 products in account","Unbelievable world building and detail, well-developed characters, careful deliberate pacing (although slow due to having to set up a huge saga as its first entry) and a well-written script all contribute to creating a world that pulls you in and is populated by characters you care about. Despite the huge amount of text in this game (yeah by the way, stay away if you don't like reading) I found myself savoring each and every line in the game, even those by random NPCs.\nIt's like reading a good fantasy novel, it really is the best world building and such work that I've seen in a JRPG, most likely ever.\n\nThat would be reason enough to jump in, but the RPG underneath that world is also fun, balanced, and somewhat nostalgic.\nBattles have that "everything matters" feeling, a sort of mix between a strategy game and a traditional RPG system. Character progression is tied to the story, but gets really good after about the midpoint in the game, and battles ramp up in strategic scope as you go along.\n\nOverall, this should not be missed by fans of JRPGs, or anyone that enjoys good narrative and world building in video games, especially the more literary types who are accostumed to diving into fantasy novels and taking in all the details and workings of a fictional world to heart as it slowly unravels in your head.\nBy the way, the random NPCs who roam around the village and such? The soldiers? The innkeepers? They have character arcs.\nCharacter. Arcs.\n\nThat's all. There's no overstating the narrative and world detail that goes into this series.\nGet it.","July 31, 2014","true","35.6"," 394 of 411 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","394","411","0","3"

So glad you asked. Yes!\n\nShould this be your very first JRPG? Yes, but... read on.\n\n*\n\nMy recent gamplay was a 90+hr adventure (some offline) that was well worth the discounted price (-50% = 8€). The game's positive reviews are well-deserved, but tell little of actual gameplay to someone who might be interested in this kind of RPG, but never did play a JRPG/SRPG.\n\nThis was may be your case, too, so here's what I learned...\n\n*****  World of Zemuria: thoughtful, detailed, infinitely rich. (5/5)\n\nFor this installment in the popular franchise we get to adventure in Kingdom of Liberl, discovering a wide-reaching plot and tackling some mysteries. Cliché much?\n\nThis game does not shy away from the overused concepts, but delivers them with fresh spins, and gives them some unexpectedly serious reasoning. Talking to various NPC's, including random household members, paints the game's stage a somber shade of grey - with much emphasis on recently fought war and new orbment technologies available. (You'll be amazed at how many NPCs stress over a family member unable to get or hold a job.) As you march on, you'll learn that beneath all the apparent sweetness lies a serious, compelling narrative. Its logic includes economy, psychology and strategy and favours realism + logic to drive and resolve many conflicts. The overwhelming cuteness and apparent anime-aesthetics serve as a visual counter-point and a fun diversion for the consumer - as ever.\n\nXSEED did a wonderful job on translating and adapting the game. With the problems they faced[xseedgames.tumblr.com] and work ahead of them, this needs to be stressed.\n\nWarning for the easily offendable: This RPG follows the tradition of amalgamating many diverse cultural and historical influences in a distinct blend of East & West. When the Gospel and an Apostle make an appearance, they singify something else from what one might expect. Also, while loved and cared for, children of Liberl do get exposed to real danger. That orphanage you helped? Burnt to the ground. The grand-daughter wanting to help her grandpa? Gets sternly warned, but ultimately joins for an incredibly dangerous infiltration mission to rescue him.\n\n***** Playable characters: varied, with very flexible builds, require some system mastery. (5/5)\n\nYou get to make a party of up to 4 PCs and as the story goes on, more people join the Bright kids. The Bracer Guild they're a part of provides them with much quest fodder and some plot protection, but ultimately, they're on their own. Their companions are darn well excellent and come in very handy: if you can't fight through an area, wait until your ranks well. Of the 6 available, Schera's and Oliverier's antics made me giggle ever so often, and they are my favourites. In lieu of an old favourite of mine, imagine a game where most of in-game banter has Sands pitted against Neeshkas... You'll love it.\n\nSo what's with the builds? They are limited, but not in a bad way. The character level-ups are automated, abilities are unlocked intermittently and vary greatly (each character has a different build, but no class). You get a pick of 5 equippable items + some slots to fill wil crystals which are more than wondrous items, because they synergize. You may play around for a bit and just pick anything to wear/slot, because there's always a reload/retry or flight from a battle... I've actually made it halfway through the game before I read up on those orbal crystals and made my first optimized builds.\n\nAll in all, the character building is very beginner-friendly, which helps a lot. And there's ample room for experiment, which is great. Strategic value of turn-based combat is best described elsewhere, but let's just say it doesn't disappoint.\n\nWarning for the lazy: The characters need to be fine-tuned, eventually. Final chapter presents a tournament which requires a higher level of orbal system mastery, while the final battle sequence ranges from enjoyable (if you got the combinations right) to downright enfuriating (if you didn't).\n\nWarning for time-constrained: Beware the walls of text. Seriously. It's a living book.  It eats players.\n\nWarning for the romantically inclined: There is much in-game talk about the nature of Joshua and Estelle's growing relationship, yet not one NPC seems to mind the fact that they're officially siblings (Estelle is Cassisus' daughter, and Joshua's his ward/stepson). Which is fine by me, because the two couldn't be more opposed than they are, and their confusion about life & love is delivered tactfully and with much wit.\n\n***  The gameplay : a rocky ride to get through the story. (3/5)\n\nWhat I didn't miss here was a feeling of game being rushed and some content dropped because of time constraints - something my favourite Western RPGs chronically suffer from. The main narrative is one of adventure, with walls of text hinting at massive spoilers. I enjoyed it immensely, and can't wait for the sequel!\n\nWith that said, there are some glaring issues with gamplay and story presentation. The one thing I did have a problem with were wildly varying secret quests one can discover along the way (you'll need to consult a guide[www.gamefaqs.com] to get them). In-game Junior Bracer Journal served me well as an agenda, so that's a plus.\n\nWarning in general: achievements such as best rank/weapon take a lot of time and effort, so be warned and grab a guide BEFORE starting the game properly. As TvTropes put it, my playthrough suffered a heavy case of Guide Dang It!\n\nWarning for time-constrained:  I didn't mind all the grinding, but you can't escape it. Especially if you want the best gear the game's got or insist on micro-managing stuff. The difference between starting the Chapter 1 as L14 (my first try) and L18 (the second playthrough I finished) taught me to grind as I save: at every opportunity, as much as I can. And also, the railroading, apparently a traditional facet of the JRPG genre. Finally, hasty decisions versus small time windows. You can miss so much with only a click. I re-did the Prologue because I was merely getting to know the ropes and I missed two books I wanted to collect. The re-run was worth it.\n\n*\n\nTL;DR: Very good game, with some issues for the uninitiated. Merits a sequel (localization's in the works!) and a second playthrough (especially for achievements).\n\n*\n\nThank you for reading this review. It was my first, and I hope it served you well. =)","January 8, 2015","true","55.9"," 231 of 240 people (96%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","96","231","240","8","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vegosiux/recommended/251150/","Vegosiux","Radene","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Vegosiux/","260 products in account","Now this is one of those games that scratch that nostalgia itch, nostalgia for times when I was a decade or two younger and all I could ask from a game was to tell you and let you participate in a story that's worth being heard. You will find no shiny loot to show off to your acquaintances with, you will find no quick instant gratification here. If you seek that, go grab the current flavor of the month blockbuster.\n\nWhat this game has, and in spades, at that; is the world, the characters, the story, the music and a lot of subtlety. Oh, and a boat chase scene. It has a boat chase scene.\n\nMoving along, this isn't a game to be played with half your attention elsewhere. You're going to miss on a lot if you don't really pay attention. And when I say you're going to miss a lot, I mean both quests and entertainment. The character interaction, while scripted, is a lot more natural than is typical for the genre, with off-hand remarks, interjections, under-the-breath murmurs and such. The protagonist duo, again, not typical for the genre, does well to avert the usual "Brooding Bishonen with Baggage" protagonist problem with JRPGs to a large degree. Also, it is not a story about a couple of kids saving the world of useless adults; It's more about a couple of kids getting swept up into more than they bargained for, and doing their part.\n\nThe combat can get a little repetitive at times, hair-pullingly frustrating at others, and just plain annoying at others still, because, dammit, I was in the middle of something and now this bunch of mobs is trying to interrupt me! Still, the possibilities with the customization of every character's magic setup along with the option to interrupt an enemy turn with your own limit break makes for quite tactical combat that can get you away with your skin even from a surprise attack.\n\nThe storytelling is detailed and at times quite persistent, there are several scenes that last for about ten minutes before you're back to the gameplay, but again, with how naturally the characters converse, it doesn't feel off.  Now, the story itself does get a bit overwhelming at the halfway point, but if you've been paying attention, you can see many of the twists coming; or rather, you will figure out that there will be a twist; the twist itself is still likely to sweep you clean off your feet. Oh and by the way, NPCs travel around the world too, and remember you if you met before, and the subtlety of the worldbuilding is amazing. For a minor example, at some point there's a restaurant where you can hear that recent problems with monsters are making it hard to get ingredients for their dishes. If you don't take care of that problem, they  will actually go and change their menu (and the items you can buy there).\n\nThe music is simply amazing, but that's nothing new for a Falcom game.\n\nNow excuse me, I have a New Game Plus to play. On Nightmare.","October 18, 2014","true","74.5"," 189 of 201 people (94%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","94","189","201","13","4"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/evileagles/recommended/251150/","evileagles","EvilEagles","http://steamcommunity.com/id/evileagles/","389 products in account","Trails in the Sky, or Sora no Kiseki, is an expansive RPG trilogy with massive content - very well done world-building and well-paced characterization. The story begins slowly and quietly with Estelle and Joshua, along with a couple friends. The pace picks up during mid-game before ending with a fantastic finale. The story does well in holding an epic scale while at the same time remains personal where it’s needed, as Estelle and Joshua travel together and develop themselves. It’s pretty clear that Falcom’s ambition is to create a tasteful unified world for all of their Kiseki games. That is something I really value.\n\nEstelle is pretty annoying, to be quite frank. But regardless of that, she’s a very well-developed character with a lot of personality depth. To compliment her stubborn and hot-headed nature and balance out the personality chart, there is her ugh … partner, Joshua, who is usually quiet, calm, and very clever. Their interactions and relationship in general are a pleasure to watch. The rest of the cast consists of very well-distinguished characters too, but I’m going to let you decide that. SnK isn’t the only game with well thought-out characters for sure. All I’m saying is, Estelle and Joshua are one hell of an enjoyable pair.\n\nThe battle system is a mixture of traditional turn based and grid based battle system. Aside from the usual RPG combat elements, the grid provides the players with a lot of depth for strategic combat decisions, regarding space and sometimes even time. In terms of combat abilities, the characters are also very well-varied and well-balanced, allowing a lot of customization to suit your playstyle. Not to mention that the Quartz system plays a big role in determining each character’s combat abilities as well.\n\nIf you love JRPGs, you should definitely give Trails in the Sky a try. Despite the slow beginning, I promise the deep world-building and character interactions will keep you engaged.","July 29, 2014","true","54.3"," 366 of 429 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","366","429","0","6"

And if I had to name the best jRPG I've ever played, there's no doubt in my mind- it is The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky. Forget about cult classics Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 7- they were very good games to be sure, but just don't measure up to this little gem. The only jRPG that comes close as far as I'm concerned is the original Suikoden, and even then I'm aware that's mostly my nostalgia speaking.\n\nOn to the game itself: its combat is serviceable. I know that's not much of a recommendation, and it shouldn't be; the tightness of their combat systems has never been a main draw of jRPGs. In this genre, combat is usually more relaxing and cathartic than engaging, and while there are exceptions in harder games or game modes, the way to beat those is more brainy puzzle-solving than high-octane action. Combat in jRPGs mostly serves as breaks between storytelling segments, and the combat for The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky does an excellent job in that regard; you can dodge encounters when you don't feel like fighting, if you're underleveled you'll earn a lot of experience and catch up quickly, and if you're overleveled combat will provide very few rewards, signalling that you're more than ready to advance the story. Tip: Speed is the best stat, seek to boost it with your orbments.\n\nThe cast of companions is good but not hugely memorable; besides the two main characters, there will be high points in your cast of companions like the devious Scherazard and low points like the dullard Agate. This works just fine, because the spotlight throughout the game is shone on protagonists Estelle and Joshua, and the mystery surrounding their father, Cassius Bright. I won't go into detail because spoiling the story would be criminal; it is hands down the best story I've ever seen in a jRPG, and probably the best story I've seen in a videogame, period. It is full of intrigue, misdirection and foreshadowing; in a fantastic deconstruction of jRPG tropes, not everything foreshadowed ends up coming to happen, as your group only sees an incomplete picture of a complex puzzle, and their interpretations of events and what's going on behind the scenes are merely educated guesses- which sometimes hit the mark, and sometimes don't. When the end of the game comes along and the storylines unravel, I was flabbergasted; I couldn't stop thinking about the game for weeks.\n\nThe game's writing is delightful. In jRPGs, we've grown to expect either shoddy translations or faithful translations of shoddy original dialogue. Not here; the lines the characters speak always feel authentic, like something people would actually say in their situations. When Estelle and Joshua are playing the part of the rookies, travelling alongside a more experienced Bracer, it is brilliantly reflected in the story and the dialogue; there's a myriad of small details which Joshua and (especially) Estelle might miss, but a more experienced Bracer like Scherazard wouldn't. When a more senior bracer pulls rank on you, you can tell that they have good reason to do so (except when Agate does it. He's just a jerk).\n\nThere's a bunch of optional quests to complete throughout the game in the form of Bracer assignments; some are fairly straightforward, others require more lateral thinking, and one in particular just about requires looking up the answers on the internet. Yes, the stupid library quest for finding the missing books. These side quests are okay, but nothing to write home about; the heart and soul of this game is in the story and the writing. The places you visit, the people you meet... it seems straightforward, but then it hits you in the face and you realize it was a curveball. Not always.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DingusSuprice/recommended/251150/","DingusSuprice","SupriceSupplies","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DingusSuprice/","105 products in account","The Legends of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, a game I randomly found on the steam store which caught my attention.\nWhen I bought this, I never expected something like this game.\n\nThe first in its trilogy which I recently learned, the second of which being released on steam around 2 weeks ago as of writing this, which reminded me to actually play this game again and see how the story went further.\n\nFor more than 10 months, I've been missing out.\n\nI would abbreviate it but that's a no-no in this case.\n\n\nAt its core, Trails in the Sky is more or less a strategy-RPG. What I mean by this is that when you encounter enmies, there's a grid-like field on which your characters can move around as well as the enemies, but there's also an overworld in which you can walk around, shop, do sidequests, as well as other things.\n\nGraphics and Visuals:\nI'm not really sure how to put it. I really like the artstyle and the character models, or sprites. I'll just go with sprites. The character sprites kinda look like dolls. Which I don't really see all to often, and I really like it. The artstyle is rather simple which works. But they aren't exactly remarkable. I mostly remember the areas for what's in them, and not for how they look. There were also a couple of graphical bugs and in some cutscenes when someone walks away they just suddenly pop away instead of moving out of the screen. As well as some waiting in their places until they come around and say something, as if it were some sort of stage play. Not to mention, considering the game itself is quite old. A PSP game if I remember correctly, so the framerate isn't all too fast.\nNow, one thing that just drags the visual quality up are the effects. Just look at ANY art attack or S-Craft and you'll know what I mean, but more on these things later.\nOverall: 7/10\n\nSoundtrack:\nAlongside with the story, my favourite part of the entire game. I'm just going to say it bluntly to ye alright?\nThis game has my favourite soundtrack of any video game ever.\nWords aren't enough to describe it. Just. The arrangement, the instruments, holy flipsticks it's SO GOOD.\nJust a whopping 10/10\nEdit 11/3/2016: Played SC, has better soundtrack. Still a 10/10 though.\n\nGameplay:\nEdit 11/3/2016: Realised this is a review, not a tutorial. Edited the gameplay section\n\nI'll try to keep this quick and simple. Standard RPG stuff. Combat has regular attacks, magix (or arts) (fire, wind, earth, water (holy crap avatar), time and I think space and mirage? The latter 2 elements definetly exist, I just forgot whether they have attacks or not). You move around on a grid of some sort and you can unleash a special attack once you got enough CP (Craft Points, not Cheese Pizza. Sheesh). So that's all regarding combat. The rest is what you'd expect from an RPG: Sidequests, people to talk to, etc. The dungeons aren't the most impressive either (they tend to have a REALLY simple layout)\n\nOverall: 7/10\n\n\nStory and Characters\nLike I said before, this is the first game in a TRILOGY. There's more to the story than what this game alone offers.\nBut for what it offers, holy damn it's good.\nThis isn't really about deities or chosen ones, your 2 main characters: Estelle and Joshua are the main stars who just became junior bracers and go around the country to become Senior Bracers. That's the small part of it. If you want the big part, go play the game. It's real good.\nSo about those characters? You know, those loveable, memorable characters? Amazing. Just amazing. Each of the charactes, or atleast the ones somewhat of relevance are so likeable (or hateable) they always put a smile on my face. That Dialogue? That gold is sold. Seriously. Some of the conversations are absolutely hilarious! It knows when its supposed to be serious and when it isn't, but seriously, don't skip the dialogue. The sad part is is that every chapter you got different party members (aside for Joshua and Estelle, which you always have.) I wanted to see more Olivier ok.\nExpect to read. Alot.\nOverall: 9.5/10\n\nEnjoyment: 9/10\nThe characters and story are definetly what make this game. The gameplay also works and is pretty enjoyable, but IMO, the story takes the cake by far. However, like I said previously. There's quite a bit of backtracking, but that's mainly in the sidequests. So I can't give it a perfect score. But despite all that. I can say that this game takes the cake for my favourite JRPG. Atleast until I get to play Trails 2.\n\nOverall: 8.5/10\nA definite recommend for people who like RPGs and love a good story. The gameplay is also pretty fun (though not the most detailed) and you can mess around with some things. However, if you don't text masses; I suggest you stay away.","November 13, 2015","true","48.3"," 139 of 149 people (93%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","93","139","149","16","8"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/krelian91/recommended/251150/","krelian91","Krelian","http://steamcommunity.com/id/krelian91/","156 products in account","Making its first appearance on the western market only in 2011 on the PSP, Trails in the Sky First Chapter is a game originally developed in 2004 and in many ways shows its age, from its rudimentary (yet pleasant) graphics to the slow battle animations. But these small things are nothing compared to the merits that this gem of a game shows.\n\nFirst of all let's start from what sets this game apart from all other JRPGs: the WRITING.\nThis is some of the best writing I've seen in any jrpg; unlike a lot of other titles, the dialogues actually sound like things people would say in a normal conversation; while some of the dialogue might seem a bit superfluous and pedantic, every line and event shows a deeper meaning in the long run and you'll be pleasantly surprised every hour about how natural the interactions between the characters sound.\nWhich brings me to the second biggest point of the game: the characters.\nThe main cast of the game is exceptional: the members of the party are more or less all representative of a certain trope (the Genki Girl, the rude but tender-hearted warrior, the Spoony Bard etc.) but they all have interesting quirks about them and falling in love with all of them is pretty easy. Every character has a personality of its own and a role to play in the story. Even the NPCs (ALL OF THEM!) have their own name, personality and parallel story going on in the meantime.\nThe game presents a level of detail hardly seen in the genre, and the lore is simply astounding. The world of the game presents a very complex socio-political situation and an interesting history spanning more than a thousand years, with so many different elements (cultural, religious, economic etc.) that give off an organic vibe usually present only in novels.\n\nThe gameplay side of the game, while it's nothing overly exceptional (it's a 2004 game after all) is well made and fairly entertaining. The battle system is some kind of hybrid between Grandia and Xenosaga, you can move your characters around the battlefiled almost like in a tactical jrpg, and every other turn you can get a bonus like HP healing, critical hits and so on. The battles are pretty easy (and a bit boring) in the beginning but things get quite different after enemies become stronger and more difficult to kill and you have access to more interesting and complex spells and crafts. At the end of the game things can get quite challenging, and there's a boss battle in particular which will feel extremely satisfying to win.\nThe ability system of the game is quite similar to the one present in Final Fantasy VII, you have these orbs called Quartz, and according to the combination of the Quartz's elements you can access different spells in battle (and also get some passive bonus like +10%HP and so on)\n\nThe plot of the game is very solid: unlike most jrpgs where you have to save the entire world from catastrophe, the action is restricted to a single kingdom and there is no thousand-years old deity to slay at the end of the game; the game presents and more "humble" and personal story where two young adventurers set off to a journey to travel around their homeland and end up finding a lot of unexpected things along the way. Nevertheless it's quite intriguing and after a certain point in the game you'll keep playing to see how things turn out in the end.\n\nThe Good:\n- Superb writing\n- Massive and interesting lore\n- Complex and lovable characters\n- Good battle system\n- Story packed with intrigue and mysteries (after a few hours, though)\n\nThe Bad:\n- The pacing of the story is not always perfect, and you might yawn a few times during the first hours\n- Slow battle animations\n- So many missables. Getting everything in this game without a guide is a nightmare\n\nIn conclusion:\nPLAY THE GAME IF: You're into jrpgs, good writing, engaging stories, and you're not afraid to delve into something that might be a lot more complex than you thought.\nDON'T PLAY THE GAME IF: You don't like reading and have little patience for a plot that takes a while to evolve. Also if you hate cliffhangers.\n\nOverall, I'd give this game a 8.5/10. One of the best surprises of the recent years!","October 18, 2014","true","44.9"," 85 of 92 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","85","92","0","2"

The game presents its characters in a bright fashion that can't help but make you feel attached to them, especially well done with its two main characters, but its not limited to just Estelle and Joshua. As you go on about your adventure, you'll meet interesting characters (including NPCs, yes, they have personalities! Take that, Skyrim Radiant AI) from all across the land all while protecting your country and its Queen.\n\nThe games boasts a big +50 hours worth of core gameplay, not including the many sidequests that are set aside for you to take on later, which are inhernt in any kind of RPG. It plays as a strategy RPG, similar to titles like Disgaea, minus the crazy numbers and level grind, but it has the unfortunate drawback of being a bit slow and takes its time before being more than just natural button inputs during battle. While there is an interesting crafting system such as the quartz (basically materia if you wanna go by Final Fantasy 7 familiarity) and weapon skill crafting, it doesn't help the in-game combat to be more exciting and only forces you to sift through more menus and text. I'm hoping the second and third chapter will add more to it to help create much more needed combat management in a S-RPG, nothing crazy like Phantom Brave, but it definitely leaves something to be desired as its main strengths are the incredibly large amount of dialogue.\n\nI'm so sorry, Xseed translators, that you had to put off second and third chapter off for so long because of the scary amount of texts.\nEDIT: Whoops, probably should've worded that properly to avoid any confusion. I'll just clear it right now. I AM SO HYPED FOR SECOND AND THIRD CHAPTER THANKS TO CARPE FULGAR, AHHHHHHHH. That'll fix it.\n\nIf you have a love for old school type of JRPG that have memorable characters, such as Secret of Mana, Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 4, or even Tales of series, then I'd definitely would say its worth investing in this trilogy.","July 29, 2014","true","2.9"," 136 of 168 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","136","168","0","8"

Mostly, it's an exploration and dialogs where the fun lies. And books. But there's a light turn-based tactical combat, although it's far more simple than any other established title in the genre (FF:T, Agarest, Disgaea, etc.).\n\nStory progression revolves around the Bracers Guild quests, with some optional sidequests picked around the town(s). To sweeten the pot, there's a magic system based on Quartz crafting (similar to materia system from FF7) and cooking.\n\nAlso, it has a wonderful soundtrack.\n\nThis game was quite thoroughly polished from it's original version released in 2004, with a lot of additions from the later PSP release (some features are coming down the road, after release). Sadly, it had some rocky start, but now it runs quite stable and very smoothly (it's an old game with low system requirements), but it holds very well, especially with new high-res fonts.\n\nIn conclusion, if you're looking for some refreshing JRPG with very detailed world, characters and story-oriented gameplay, you MUST try it.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/biendeo/recommended/251150/","biendeo","Biendeo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/biendeo/","835 products in account","Long story short: One of the best narratives in any RPG, coupled with engaging gameplay and aesthetic. Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky may be a bit too long and forgiving for some, but is the most perfect game to get for anyone looking into the JRPG genre.\nSPOILER-FREE\n\nI haven't played too many JRPGs apart from Final Fantasy VII, Fire Emblem, and a butt-load of Pokemon games, and I've also never played a game before in the Legend of Heroes series, which has been going for nearly 30 years. This game was originally released back in 2004, and only got an English release in 2011 for PSP.\n\nBefore we get into mechanics, aesthetically it feels like an older game. Textures and models are a little low res, characters are 2D sprites, and may look a little strange with texture filtering, and the audio may sound more like MIDI loops at times. I also found that with 16:9 resolutions, sometimes you'd see the void past the skybox or the world in the corners of the screen. That being said, the art style itself is vibrant with expressive character portraits, and the music itself is very catchy. The regular battle music does not get old, which is always a plus. Even with some of the technical issues from being an older game, it still has a unique charm to it.\n\nThe gameplay itself has you walking along areas with monsters lying about. Touching an enemy (or getting touched by it) enters the battle, similar to Earthbound, and you can approach it from its back to get an extra turn. This allows the player to avoid encounters (and in fact the game is very forgiving, as you can run away from battles, no risk, no cost). Each of the game's chapters takes place in a different region, and generally you'll be hanging around in each area for a bit, doing a few side quests presented to you (which may count for about 30% of gametime). Side quests are presented via a bulletin board, and give a time limit on how far you can continue with the story without losing the quest, which is nice for those new to the game to know about.\n\nThe combat takes place on a grid-based board, where characters can move towards enemies and attack in 2D space. Characters have magic attacks which take time to charge (costing EP), and have special abilities which can be instantly casted for CP (which is earned by dealing or receiving damage). Every character has an S-craft (a limit break ability) if they reach 100 CP, which becomes extra powerful at 200 CP, and they can execute these not only on their turn, but also in between anyone's turns. On top of that, special effects like critical attacks are attached to a certain upcoming turn, and the player can use arts magic and S-breaks to try to swing those effects to their favour, adding another level of depth to the combat. Since the overall game starts a bit slowly, it gives the player plenty of time to learn these mechanics, and to understand how they fit together. When the player dies, the game is very forgiving, as you can just restart a battle from how it started. The game also enables a feature by default where restarting a battle like this lowers the skill of the opponent by a bit, making it easier to beat them. Dedicated players should turn this off, but I believe this feature works well for keeping the story flowing.\n\nMagic and equipment are mostly given to you throughout the game. There exist shops that sell these items, but money is a bit scarce in the game to do that all the time, and it ends up just being easier to find these items on the field or by doing side quests. Generally equipment is clearly better or worse than other equipment. It purely comes down to which one has the better numbers. On top of that, some later magic items are clearly better than others. Fortunately, you only get 6 magic slots per character, so deciding what kinds of magic each character uses is interesting, as they can not only give types of spells, but also passive bonuses such as extra HP or dexterity. This concept is pretty fleshed out, and gives the player a lot of room to experiment with different strategies, and trying to find playstyles for each character. Overall, the combat is very interesting, and is presented quite nicely for new players to the genre to get into. It's also not insultingly simple, so you'll feel good doing combat, and since you can run from encounters easily (apart from bosses), you'll never feel that you're just grinding through an area.\n\nBut the biggest draw of this game is its story, mainly through how complete every character seems. They all have motives, they all have personalities, and quite a few of them develop. Generally, each party character is introduced in a chapter of their own, and they all have small story arcs as they try to overcome a problem that they're having. The two main characters, Estelle and Joshua Bright, are incredibly engaging to follow on their quest as they head to each region to become senior bracers. There is a clear goal from the beginning to end of the story, and it feels complete when it everything comes together in the end. Those two characters are some of the best written that I've ever seen in any video game, and I wish I was exaggerating that statement. There's a motif of growing up echoing through every scene of the game, and it's expressed heavily through these two characters.\n\nWhile each chapter of the game is its own mini-story, each with its own new characters, villains, and locales, there is an over-arching plot that I won't say anything about. The two main characters end up getting pulled into this plot through everything they do, and it's quite clever how everything ends up in the game. Overall, it's a little cliched, but the writing itself, as well as the strong personalities of the characters keeps it from feeling bland and rehashed.\n\nThe world itself oozes personality too. NPC characters are witty and all have personalities too, and generally world events, even those that happen before the game's story, all echo through architecture and dialogue. The strongest part about all of this is that you don't need to play any other game in the franchise to learn this; it's all introduced fluently and succinctly. The most amusing part are the comments that display when you try to check an opened treasure chests. I won't spoil any, that'll be a treat for you.\n\nI'd recommend this game to anyone, particularly if you've never played a JRPG before. It's charming, it's engaging, and it's complex enough to be interesting without alienating the player. It's extremely forgiving with its quick saving and difficulty tweaks, and its story and world is so captivating that it's hard to stop playing. And it's $20, which is a steal for its length of ~40 hours.\n\nRATING: 3 UP, 0 DOWNSMy up/down rating system tries to differentiate between games that are mediocre (less ups and downs total), and games that are interesting but flawed (more ups and downs totals).

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kwarisover/recommended/251150/","kwarisover","Lord Kane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kwarisover/","384 products in account","I played the original release of Frist Chapter back in 2006 and the Second Chapter in 2008, and now my son (4-yr-old) is playing the re-released on Steam. On a glance this is one of your staple JRPG: cute and seemingly clueless though motivated protagonists, tactical turn-based combat, heavy text-based menu and stats/mechanisms. But beneath that thin layer of disguise, you would have one of the most wonderfully made story-driven RPGs with a plot as dark as the Witcher series (dare I say) you have ever played--if you play all three entries you will reach the same conclusion.\n\nNeedless to say the story goes beyond the good vs. evil scheme, but characters in this game also evolve in a believable way. They are very aware of the changing world and interact with each other in meaningful ways. Suffice to say you won't find any one-dimensional character in this game, be it a protagonist or antagonist.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is the quality of English translation, which I believe has been to be marvelously done by professionals. It's almost like a re-interpretation of the source material--if you will--in Japanese. This definitely sets this game (and most likely its sequel--Second Chapter and the 3rd) apart from the likes of Final Fantasy and such.\n\nYou will probably find choke full o' troupes or cliché common to comics and mangas in this game:\n- shadowy groups with profound motives beyond human comprehensions and far reach to every corner of the continent by all means fathomed by only the most conspiracy-minded individuals in the creative industry,;\n- mysterious enemy combatants ranked in number not by sheer strength but their legendary reputations;\n- villains turned out to be activists manipulated by a greater force each step of the way without a clue;\n- etc.\n\nHowever if you can look past this and accept that most of the deeper story-driven games are more or less like this, and it's only a matter of expertise to conceal the usage of these troupes, then you will have a wonderful time like me to explore this universe--its lore and its characters. Not to mention this is one of the few REAL steampunk themed games available on PC, or even the entire industry, consider it being a niche not generally looked into. And if you are concerned about cliffhangers since this is the only the first entry, worry not--for each "chapter"(game) conclude its story in a satisfying way, while foreshadowing the next one and leaving room for a respite and a sense of achievement.\n\nGameplay wise, this game sports both open-world (opened up gradually in the first 5 hours) and meaningful character customizations (able to be re-speced at any time) through assemblies of clockworks and gem-socketing (thus comply to its Steampunk theme). Enemies are varied and requires certain tactical thinking in the manners of both character positioning in the battlefield and strength/vulnerabilities of each enemy type. Character progression is also non-linear, meaning there's no hard coded class definition, so you can have detailed customization of each character's role, while everyone still has their unique specialties.\n\nAesthetically this is one of the more pleasing JRPGs you'll ever come across. The graphics have been remade into HD and its aesthetic design definitely takes cue from both contemporary and mid-19th century old-world life, and the visual design does a great job taking care of every minute detail in 3D and the textures are excellent if you take into account of the fact that this game is made in the early 2000's.\n\nThe soundtracks have been one of my favorites and it certainly sounds like it 's heavily inspired by the work of Academy award winner Joe Hisaishi.\n\nTo conclude this review, I would absolutely recommend this game to all RPG enthusiasts, even if you don't usually touch JRPG. When you do, make sure you endure through the first 3 or 4 hours of this game after which point the story really starts to pick up its pace.\n\nFinal verdict: first chapter of a deep and story-driven steampunk RPG trilogy, 9.5/10.\n","February 23, 2015","true","20.5"," 49 of 53 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","49","53","0","0"

The Kiseki series prides itself on its immersive worldbuilding and attention to small details (no NPC left out, seriously), and of course, spinning up an epic tale. Sora no Kiseki/Trails in The Sky FC (First Chapter) by itself may not be brilliant or epic in terms of story when compared to other entries in the Kiseki series, but every decent tale needs an exposition. FC is the hand (for a lack of better term in my head) that will pull players into the world of the Kiseki series. Story aside, the combat is dynamic and deviates from the usual and monotonous single button mashing. On the first playthrough, players will need to pay attention to the battles or risk having the mooks wipe the floor with them. On subsequent playthroughts at higher difficulties, mainly nightmare mode, this also applies, even if the player has acquired end game tier equipment. Those who are obsessed with optimizing their party will spend a lot of time on orbment customization. There are also many sub quests and secret sub quests that players can undertake to obtain both better equipment as well as other tidbits of info that contributes to world building. Completionists should be satisfied with the replay value this game offers. The game's OST is done by Falcom's own jdk band and there are quite a few iconic gems in the game, keep your ears opened and you won't be disappointed.\n\nAll in all, FC is but a prologue for the epic tale that spans over seven other titles. If you are a first time player of the Kiseki series, give this game a shot and see if you're hooked enough to play the sequel which should be translated soon. You won't regret jumping on this train (well, maybe a little bit. You'll be waiting for a long time if you don't know either Chinese or Japanese. The scripts for each game are pretty big). For long time fans of the series who have disposable income. Please get this to show support for those gutsy enough to translate these games for the peeps who weren't fortunate enough to try out this great series all these years.\n\nOn a more technical note. Game is crashing way too often.

Never played any games in the Legend of Heroes series before but since the game was by Falcom I thought I had to try it. (Falcom developed Ys, Xanadu, and various other series, they very reliably make quality games)\n\nI really enjoyed the combat system, it's got a nice mix of strategy rpg features while remaining fairly simple to understand. Positioning and pushing enemies around becomes important quickly, and making up good combination attacks on the fly is fun. There are randomly placed bonuses for each turn which force you to play differently each time (criticals, etc) and adapt. One negative though is that there is no way to skip or speed up attack animations, this can get pretty annoying fighting large groups or once you've played the game a lot.\n\nAfter the sluggish prologue the overall pacing of the game is great and the enemies and bosses stay varied throughout the game. Sidequests feel connected to the main game and give you worthwhile rewards.\n\nI wish the difficulty selection was available from the beginning though. I'm sure normal difficulty is very easy for some RPG veterans, I found it a bit easy but still died a fair amount of times. I felt like I was only just getting the hang of combat by the final boss, so I wish I could've started on hard.\n\nI enjoyed the characters in the story, none of them felt overly generic or annoying and there's a good amount of character development and surprises. The plot twists are well done in that they all have some hints towards them, nothing really comes out of the blue so paying attention to details is rewarded. The story leaves some questions unanswered but that isn't much of a negative if you get this now since the sequel (Second Chapter) should be released by the end of this year.","August 2, 2014","true","43.0"," 50 of 57 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","50","57","0","0"

Please forgive any potential fangirl squeeing.\n\nLEGEND OF HEROES: TRAILS IN THE SKY (Sora no Kiseki FC)\n\nWHERE TO BEGIN?!\n\nThis is my favoritest of favorite JRPGs. Ever. Seriously. There is not a JRPG I love more than this game, though I suspect that the release of SC may change that--you know what, no. Technically SC and this game are the same game, Falcom just had to split them up! So it still counts! I'd be willing to even say that FC is one of my top ten games of all time, regardless of genre. Considering the other games in that list include the original Fallout, Baldur's Gate II, Chrono Trigger and several other games widely regarded as "best game ever," that should tell you something.\n\nTrails in the Sky (Sora no Kiseki FC) is, on its surface, a pretty basic story with a fairly basic game attached to it. It looks unassuming and pedestrian on the surface, but that is simply because it hides, biding its time, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. And strike it does, and when it strikes, it strikes hard! Trails in the Sky is a fairly standard high fantasy story set in a world of political and military intrigue, but it is also the story of how two goofy teenagers grow up and mature into capable adventurers over the course of the game. But that doesn't even really cover much. The meat of the game is in its writing and story--and there's a lot of writing. Gobs and gobs of dialog and story; even the sidequests are usually fully fleshed out rather than a simple "go collect twenty bear asses" that tend to plague older RPGs just as much as they do MMOs. Even unnamed filler NPCs will commonly have multiple lines of dialogue. Trails is one of the very few games where I really feel like the characters are having an actual human conversation as I play--complete with interruptions, asides muttered under their breath and a collection of emotive portraits for most named characters that really helps convey the tone very well. Obviously the conversations in this game are scripted rather than chosen by the player, but they just feel very natural and real.\n\nThe story--oh, the story. It starts out very simple, a basic pair of greenhorn adventurers, Estelle and Joshua Bright, new to the Bracer Guild, a group of unionized do-gooders and monster-hunters, learning the ropes and working their way to full bracer status. Over the course of what will easily end up being a 50+ hour playthrough--even on my fourth playthrough, with prior knowledge of the game and using an achievement guide to get a maxed-out save file ready for SC, I still logged 42 hours on my file when the credits rolled--you will see the story shift from hometown heroes retrieving a stolen jewel to helping with a school festival, to busting a thieves' guild and unraveling a real-estate scam. And it only gets better from there, culminating in an epic yarn that spans political intrigue, military secrets, ancient technologies and the remnants of a lost, highly-advanced culture. With all of this going on, the story starts out very light-hearted, but slowly darkens over time, growing more and more serious, setting up for the Second Chapter's much darker overall tone.\n\nWriting teenagers is really quite hard, but Falcom and XSEED's localization staff really pulled it off fantastically. Estelle and Joshua feel genuine, like people you could really meet one day. Estelle acts goofy, makes realistic and understandable mistakes and Joshua is the archetypal bookish boy (though of course his story is more complex than that). The level of realism in how the plot handles having teenage main characters is actually really impressive. The two leads contribute a lot to solving the major cases they're assigned to by the Bracer Guild, but they've always got backup from more experienced and powerful adults. They're told reasonable things about their limitations, and they reasonably and realistically fail. A lot. The fact that they mess up and they experience real consequences as a result is something I love about Trails. This isn't the usual "little kid saves the world, adults are totally worthless" sort of story that seems to happen with annoying regularity every time you've got a teenager as the protagonist.\n\nIt's also, at least to me, as a "girl gamer"--that being, a female human who plays video games, of course--a treat to play such a fantastic game with a female protagonist. Especially impressive considering how old this game actually is--Trails was originally released in Japan in 2004! There aren't even very many games today, in 2014, with a locked female protagonist you can't change or play as male. In 2004 they were practically unheard of. That wins a lot of points from me personally, since I don't have a lot of money for gaming and I generally choose to spend my limited funds on titles with female protagonists over those with male protagonists.\n\nEven as much as I love Trails, it's not perfect. It has some flaws, but none of them are dealbreakers by any stretch of the imagination. The PC Steam version has some weird bugs that the PSP version doesn't have. Some of these bugs are related to the fact that the PC version on Steam is the original 2004 PC version with the PSP features backported into it. Running it on Windows 7 and 8 results in weirdness and I understand a lot of XSEED's delay with getting Trails FC and SC out had to do with making the engine behave in an operating system not called Windows XP.\n\nMy biggest single gripe with Trails is the combat. No, I don't dislike the combat, but I think it's a bit too simplistic on the surface--I wish they would have gone with an AP system instead of a "single-action, single-turn" system. I like how the turn order changes based on different things you do and your stats as well as the use of S-Breaks to "cut in line" to get specific turn bonuses. All of that was really great, but I do wish they gave you a pool of AP to combine things like positioning or aiming spells and abilities without having to wait 5 turns to finish up the hit. Using an AP system would have made the combat a lot more fast-paced and enjoyable. The boss fights are still very fun for the most part, even with the SAST system. It's mostly the trash mobs you face in the field, especially when you get into a fight with a big-♥♥♥ group of eight damage-sponge mobs. It got so annoying at points where I'd waste Joshua's field-wide S-Craft simply to get through the fight quicker without losing XP and sepith.\n\nSo yeah. A lot of breathless fangirling in there, to be sure, but I'd like to think this "review" might actually be useful to someone interested in buying the game. My advice? BUY IT IMMEDIATELY. RIGHT NOW. THEN PLAY IT UNTIL YOU COLLAPSE FROM EXHAUSTION. Because it's that good. The Trails series has become Falcom's biggest money maker in Japan and the only way we're ever going to see more of the series than Sora no Kiseki FC and SC is if we vote with our wallets!","August 15, 2014","true","44.1"," 45 of 52 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","45","52","0","0"

A game with a poor story can't be saved by amazing graphics or awesome gameplay. However, if the story is good enough, I can forgive a lot.\n\nTrails in the Sky may not have the best plot in RPG history, but it more than makes up for that with incredibly strong writing. The dialogue is amazing and each character gets several moments to shine; the main protagonist especially is incredibly fun.\n\nThe combat system is really interesting; the orbment system superficially resembles FF7's materia system, but it works really differently in ways that make the game a lot more strategic. The actual fights are most similar to FFX, with some really cool wrinkles.\n\nThe soundtrack is amazing, the controls are great, either with a mouse or a control pad and the graphics, while dated, still really work.\n\nThis is the first half of a duology; it's already one of my favorite games and from what I've heard, the sequel is EVEN BETTER.

With that said, let's move on aye?\n\nI have played some great JRPGS, even some counted as the best this world has ever seen. Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy 6, the Tales series, Star Ocean and the Quintet trio. The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the sky... definitely has the right to stand amongst them. It's not the best JRPG I have ever played, but definitely somewhere near the top. I'd even say this is one of the best games I have played in 2015, on Steam, and definitely on the PSP. But aye, my word is no fact, so let's list a few reasons:\n\n- The story is really good, albeit predictable at times. This is even more complimented by the EXCELLENT characters. Every character gets enough development, and have some sort of relation with at least one of the characters, which makes everything fall in place. Especially the main duo, Estelle and Joshua, are great characters. You just can't wait to see how they develop throughout the game.\n- The gameplay is good. It doesn't really do anything bad, but not anything outstanding either. But every character feels different from each other, and this is further distinguished by the orbal system. Want your Estelle to be a healer or a tank? That's where the orbal system comes in. S-crafts and S-breaks also have the potential to change the tide of battle, and it's exciting to see these attacks pull off.\n- All locations, towns and dungeons feel different from each other. They are fresh, and never feel like a drag. You can even explore some of these locations before doing them in the main quest, netting some neat equipment and making the journey even easier.\n- Quests feel varied and never really boring either. There aren't even too many quests that involve killing a certain amount of monsters, so there's no need to worry about that.\n- The game can be finished in 30 hours, but why would you? The game has so much content and if you want to do everything, it can easily go up to 40 or 50 hours.\n\nThere is only one negative I can think of when it comes to this game: it's a completionist/achievement nightmare. Unless you use a guide, there's bound to be something you miss, resulting in you missing more than just one achievement. I am not an achievement hunter at all, but even then it's pretty discouraging to see that you have just missed some tiny pieces. I got the feeling that I talked to everybody, and even then it wasn't enough.\n\nOverall, a really great JRPG I recommend to everybody. Can't wait for part 2 to come on to Steam!","August 15, 2015","true","38.0"," 38 of 43 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","38","43","0","0"

I think the best part about Trails in the Sky is that the people are people. They're not just archetypes. They're developed, with feelings, and personalities, and they are, with the exception of one, all very relateable. It follows a few various tropes, but in the end you really are engrossed in the life of becoming a Bracer (the guild being super helpful law enforcement officers; reminiscent of the police I encountered when studying abroad in Japan). The story doesn't revolve around you, it evolves with you. Things are happeneing in this world, and the party isn't the focus of those events. Your characters strive to rise to the challenges presented to them, and though the storyline and paths are linear, I didn't at all mind being guided through such an enchanting tale with thought-provoking characters.\n\nLight-hearted and childish, this game can be understood by preteens and teenagers, but much like any good story, it has underlying themes and issues that adults can grapple with and appreciate.\n\nFrom the bisexual bard whose bisexuality is not the defining characteristic of his character, to the strong, bull-headed, stubborn female protagonist, this game does a pretty good job of showing me a world I'd want to be a part of, and was glad to have experienced, if only for a little while.","February 4, 2015","true","114.8"," 37 of 43 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","37","43","0","0"

Once at around the 2 hour mark, and once more at around 10 hours in.  If an RPG manages to get past those two milestones, then it's safe to say that I've become invested and am enjoying myself.  The story is very good, despite a few cliches here and there.  I feel like all the characters are unique, and more importantly, alive.\n\nThe progression of the story is also interesting, as it plays out more like a "coming-of-age" story than what I'm used to from most games of the same genre.  Estelle and Joshua travel across the country, remaining the only permanent members of the party.  In each chapter, 2 characters are introduced and added to the party, and go their own ways at the end of the chapter.  It's refreshing to follow Estelle and Joshua through the story as they grow into their own respective roles.","October 25, 2014","true","60.7"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","30","35","0","0"

I have only played a handful of JRPGs such as Valkyria Chronicles, another of my favorites (most of which, including LoH aren't traditional JRPGs) however the appeal of this game, along with the likes of Valkyria Chronicles, is the connection to the characters, supported by a terrific battle system that emphasizes strategy and preparation.\n\nWhat makes this game special, for me, is the dialogue and the characters. So much care and thought is put into the writing and the cadence of the dialogue, that it really reads like a comic or a manga where, even though you read the dialogue, the intonations of the characters come across to make them real people with values, strengths and weaknesses, and not simply there to move things along.\n\nLoH takes its time, as well it should.\n\nToo often, things are thrust into an "end of the world" scenario in video games that compels a forward momentum with the main quest, but LoH meanders. It is a tale about the journey, and not so much the final boss battle, to the point that the game is more than the sum of its mechanics. This is rare, in a video game, I think. Lesser games use the story as window-dressing for its mechanics, but things like putting on the school play, while little more than "cutscenes" are given weight and gravitas that it is clear, to me, that the developers consider it just as important as the battle system.\n\nThe battle system, too, is a lot of fun and while I don't have much to say about it, I do like the balance it achieves in terms of giving each character its own style, while still allowing a certain degree of customization with the Orbment system.\n\nI'm reiterating myself, but the meat is in the writing, and there is always the impression that Estelle & Co. are making their own personal journies within the greater macrocosm of a mysterious political world that is shifting with tectonic unease... pieces on the board are moving, and the beauty is being able to step inside the shoes of Estelle's perspective (who is really the main character, at least of this chapter), and be lost, grappling with the pieces of the puzzle.\n\nA balancing of the microcosmic, personal concerns with the larger, political and altruistic values is something that LoH manages to achieve, to the point that the game feels... well, like a full course meal.\n\nThis is food for the soul, you could say.\n\nFrom the technical perspective, the music is terrific and enhances the atmosphere and connection to the diegesis. I had a few CTDs when I first installed, but IIRC, there was a patch and since then I have had no problems in my 55 hrs with the game.\n\n10/10","November 8, 2014","true","54.9"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","26","29","0","0"

There's a direct sequel on its way so if you're still on the fence about buying this, wait until Second Chapter arrives to make a final decision.\n\n[Story - good]: If you don't like the anime and JRPG genres you should probably stop reading because this game has many cliches and cultural habits from them and no amount of praise will be able to convince you to like it. However the world building and dailogue of First Chapter is like the calm before the storm, the disc 1 of PS1 RPGs, an incredibly large prologue. The little things dropped here and there really get you wondering about where it's all really headed but you have to be willing to give it a chance.\n\n[Characters - very good]: Speaking of cliche I can admit that there's a lot of them. Especially with the characters, you can pretty easily figure out who the bad guys are or how the good guys are going to react to situations (save for the end, I knew it was going to happen but HOW it happened was a surprise). But at the same time they grow and change which can be seen in their dialogue, your main characters are fledgling bracers afterall.\n\n[Graphics - depends]: I personally like everything about how the game looks, cinematics and all. But others may be turned off by the older 3D and anime style character models.\n\n[Music - average]: It isn't the most epic soundtrack but it at least fits each situation except maybe the normal battle music but at the same time it's a jazz tune which basically tells you to sit back, relax and enjoy the game's pace.\n\n[Difficulty - good]: For me the challenge is just right but it also depends on how much you think about how to use your assets. Depending on the fight and how you plan, the fight can be stupidly easy or frustratingly hard.\n\n[Combat - very good]: There's a reason it's turn-based and with so many ways of attacking. Part of the fun is figuring out what you can do with your spells, special attacks, equipment and positioning. Sometimes simply moving your characters to the front or back rows can make all the difference in a fight.\n\n[Length - good]: The pacing makes it seem long but by the time you hit the end you'll realize it's not and wish it kept going (which it will because First Chapter and Second Chapter were originally intended to be 1 game).\n\n[Replayability - average]: I've already played through to the last dungeon once but had to restart and I'm not bored or tired of it 50 hours into this new playthrough either. Add in the New Game+, achievements and how much of a completionist you want to be along with bonuses you'll get to carry over to the upcoming Second Chapter, there's plenty to offer by replaying it.\n\n[Bugs - average]: Some people have had more trouble with these than others but the game has been out long enough that most of the common issues have been solved by the publisher with patches already or has a guide on how to fix the problem on the steam forums. Which, by the way, gets monitored by the publisher and is regularly visited to help with issues and keep us updated on the rest of the Trails in the Sky series.\n\nMy only real negative is not being able to skip battle animations and cutscenes which makes redoing parts when you realize you missed something and have to reload from an earlier save, a bit of a pain.","December 10, 2014","true","185.4"," 19 of 19 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","19","19","0","0"

Though lately, some of them just havn't been pulling me in like they used too.\n\nThis game however, was a great surprise. From the very start, the first thing you'll see is crisp, beautiful graphics, though retro style, they aren't blurry, or hard on the eyes. If you use the configuration tool before you start the game, you can set the screen to your native screens resolution, unlike other JRPGs, which again, is a huge plus.\n\nAs you start the story, you get the old school feel, both how it starts, the deep character personalities. As the game progresses, it pulls you in.\n\nBe Warned, this is an old school game. If you're the type of person who doesn't care about a story, and likes to just button mash through text, like a brain dead turd, this isn't the game for you.\n\nIf you're the gamer who actually cares about getting lost in the story, this is not one to pass up. First game in several years where I lost total track of time. Every character, no matter how little they impact the story has background character to them and a depth games just don't get anymore.\n\nThe battles are old school turn based, same as the difficulty. If you're not leveling, and paying attention, (and saving often), you will be sorry. (HP potions, and food actually matters!)\n\n20$ is a steal for this game if you're the right gamer for it. If you're a person who hasn't tried JRPGs yet, and want to get a taste, why not drop the 20$? It's a great game to get you into the style as well, easy to get into, easy on the eyes, and quite easy to get lost in (in a good way).  (Cheaper than a 1 hour movie at the theater too, what do you have to lose?).\n\nCons:\n\n*Doesn't have any cons (imho)\n\nAt least as far as I can see. It's a solid JRPG, with a solid combat system, solid storyline, solid game-play, and doesn't leave anything feeling diminished in the game itself.\n\n\nNote: Some have experienced crashes, though I've experienced none myself, the game has been running flawlessly.","August 3, 2014","true","4.0"," 32 of 42 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","32","42","0","0"

But what got me the most of all into the game is the strong bond between the two main characters you'll be always playing (from start to end), not to mention the uncoverage of their hidden backstory throughout the progression of the game.\n\nIn other words, I think this game deserves an excellent grade in my book, there is also a sequel to this game which I will be definitely playing and if you ever decide to play the first one, then I think you won't regret playing the second one either.","November 26, 2015","true","75.1"," 27 of 34 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","27","34","2","0"

The world feels reasonably flushed out.\n\nA warning however: There is a LOT of dialogue, so if you don’t like the characters it might be hard to go through. There were some points in the story where i really needed to go afk but i couldn’t because the long conversations in the story took 10mins to read through before i could save.\n\nThe characters are very ANIME, (yes i am using that as an adjective) sometimes very cliche.

It reminds me of the kind of tone that classics like Grandia and Lunar had. The attention to detail is insane, and every npc villager in every town has something new to say after almost every event. I was really impressed by how much small talk dialogue they added.\n\nIt loses a Goku because the battle system is a ton of wasted potential. It gives you movement and attack ranges, and could easily have had more combat depth because of positioning, but in practice that doesn't happen because using a move takes your entire turn. This ends up encouraging you to simply attack at all times, since moving is baked in, and leads to no control over position unless you chose to spend multiple turns micromanaging (and if the enemy moves you have to do that again). This of course results in the usual jrpg menu-battling slapfights that I have a severe aversion to.\n\nThe combat is sadly very jrpg, requiring little player agency aside from the rare interupt to disrupt casts. Most fights can simply be completely avoided, but doing this led to me being a dozen or so levels lower than what I needed to be at the end of the game and unable to pass the levelcheck at the final boss until I pointlessly ground out bear asses to make my numbers good enough to do damage to his numbers.\n\nThe game ends as part 1 of 3, and there's a pretty huge cliffhanger. So waiting for the second chapter (which supposedly ends the main story of the two protagonists) might not be a bad idea if you're worried about Falcom's typical glacial pace.","March 25, 2015","true","51.5"," 27 of 36 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","27","36","2","1"

Sure, I'll sometimes play The Last Remnant or something along those lines for its gameplay, but I haven't met a JRPG since the PS2 days that nailed down my (admittedly subjective) three characteristics of an all-around good game (story, characters and gameplay).\n\nI say all this so you can understand how surprised I was by Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, especially given the old-school style of it. I think 'heartwarmingly whimsical' describes the tone of the  game best, even at its 'to be continued' conclusion. It's a shame this game doesn't have more attention, because it certainly deserves it, and I can't wait for the second chapter to come out (hopefully by the end of this year, as planned *EDIT* Guess not).\n\nAs far as gameplay, what you see in the pictures up there describes it perfectly. It's an old-school turn-based system, where you can use a combination of gems to tailor each person's specific playstyle. There's also the Bracer Levels, where completing sidequests will give you BP and unlock rewards with each level, giving you a reason to do them. As mentioned by most the other reviews, the amount of dialogue in the game is staggering, with even NPC dialogue changing dependant on where you are in a quest.\n\nWhich brings us to story. Now, this is a story you have to be a bit patient for. It's a very slow build, but does its best to immerse you in a world that feels like it's changing around you (helped, obviously, by the changing NPC dialogue). This is the good kind of vast storytelling, where there is a massive story going on in the background, but the focus is on the core group you're following and their small part in big events. There are plenty of cliches and tropes to be found here, but that never bothers me as long as they're used in a way that doesn't come across as cheesy, which they generally don't in this game. All told, it's an EXTREMELY slow boil, but if you're big on story-heavy games, this is for you . Honestly, the story was probably one of the (if not THE) best I've seen in a JRPG (Admittedly not the highest bar to set, especially with the biggest JRPG developer out there obsessed with sequels to a terrible game and pink-haired waifu nobody likes).\n\nAs for characters, this game has a wide array of endearing characters who (with a couple exceptions) go out of their way to avoid being archtypes to fill the void between you and gameplay. The two main characters are well fleshed out, and the story itself is a very satisfying one that ends quite well. I like that they actually managed to write teenage characters without them being so grating that I wanted to stick a pair of scissors in both ears. It's no Mass Effect, Walking Dead or TLOU in the character department, but Legend of Heroes certainly had enough good characters that I found my time with them honestly enjoyable.\n\nSo do yourself a favor. If you don't mind slower JRPGs, pick this up.\n\n*Edited for typos and to add a bit more substance to it","October 30, 2014","true","44.6"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

Combat plays out like a tactics game, where your characters move freely about a grid-based map and executing a variety of attacks encompassing different ranges. The game's pacing is superb, although let down a bit by the final dungeon, which I found monotonous and dragged out.\n\nIt's kind of hard to describe how I felt when playing this game, but its the same feeling I always feel when playing a genuinely good RPG.

If you enjoy long and adventurous RPGs, not to mention JRPGs, then you've come to the right place!\n\nThe plot itself is excellent. It reflects the struggles people can experience, the pain of losing what you consider dear, and the heartwarming friendship of those around you. Estelle Bright, the main female protagonist, discovers herself stumbling upon a path to a long and winding journey with the main male protagonist, Joshua Bright. She doesn't know what to expect, but she prepares herself both mentally and physically for the challenges up ahead. Sounds a bit cliched, perhaps? But if the journey begins with an odd pair consisting of a whiny, child-like teenage girl and a smart, awkward teenage boy, who both have an unbelievable amount of potential, you start wanting to follow along to see how their future turns out.\n\nIn addition to the main plot, which was fantastically written, there is a multitude of sidequests that each have their own unique effect on the gameplay. You don't just quickly rush through the events and understand the story. You take your time with each event, paying close attention to every detail, and not only understanding the story, but feeling it and living within it. And you are able to do all of this because characters of The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is capable of pulling you into their own world.\n\nThe connections and relationships between characters are rather interesting, and you easily feel the need to know how these connections develop over time. Each character has their own wonderful background, full of mysteries that are yet to be uncovered and investigated. There is so much to learn about them and there is so much left unsaid. Their personalities are quite the attention grabber as well!\n\nAnd while wandering around and exploring to your heart's content is enjoyable, the battles are also extremely exhilarating and always keep you on edge. There is never a time when you can sit back and relax during a battle. This is because it is not always easy to defeat the monsters or the opponents, and this is a good thing. Why? If something was easy-peasy, it would be expected to get boring after a period of time. These battles are battles that you must endure and help your main characters fight through successfully. They provide some difficulty, and though it can be frustrating at some points, it really does keep you going back for more.\n\nTo top off this tall stack of excitement, the soundtrack, artwork, and design are simply impeccable. The music accompanies the beautiful scenery of the game. I always found myself being awed by it all; it never failed to amaze me.\n\nAll in all, this is a fantastic game. I certainly do not regret purchasing it at all, and I always find myself being tempted to replay it over again. So, is this something you should buy? Definitely! You have my vote!","October 9, 2014","true","41.4"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","0"

The deep story is fairly linear and a player has to be well-prepared for characters to move in and out of their party (don't get too attached to any one character as your main healer, for example, because after that chapter's over they may be gone). This movement can make for interesting gameplay as the player has to make tactical decisions about how to spread out and use their "orbments," which are the game's mechanic that give magic and special abilities to characters, especially as certain characters are better suited to certain types of orbments (e.g., Joshua's first orbment slot requires something time-based).\n\nThe characters themselves are all really charming in their own ways and will swiftly grow on you, even the ones that you don't recruit within your party. I'm especially fond of the four main female characters you encounter (Estelle, Kloe, Scherazard, and Tita), whom are all different and fun. Even better, the game frequently passes the Bechdel test and we get to see the four women interacting. None of them becomes the "token girl" you see in so many RPGs.\n\nWhile I haven't played the other two games in the trilogy (as they haven't been brought over yet!), I'm eager to see what happens next. I haven't found anything on XSEED's website that says either way (though Wikipedia tells me "by the end of 2014") but I'm hoping the PC release will mean we'll get the next two games somewhere down the line either in this format or for the PS Vita.\n\nUPDATE: Now that I've finished the game on PC, a few quick notes. After about the fourth day after release, I didn't notice any real bugs that affect gameplay, so the quick patching XSEED did seems to have worked. Further, it was really nice to turn the HD text back on as the other version gave me a headache to read. I definitely like the enhanced control systems -- you can choose to play with just a keyboard, just a mouse, mouse + keyboard, or even use a gamepad (such as an Xbox controller, which is what I generally use for PC gaming). The range of control systems meant that I could switch back and forth fairly easily if I needed to (e.g., I'd switch from a controller to the keyboard to give my hands a rest from clutching). There didn't seem to be anything major that changed in terms of the story line at all but I definitely appreciated the graphics more playing on PC vs. the PSP/Vita. I'm fairly nearsighted (if I don't have my glasses on I can't see more than about 10 inches away from my face) so playing on a tiny screen like the Vita can be a little frustrating. So it was nice to see the graphics blown up, especially since I didn't really notice any lost quality.","July 30, 2014","true","86.5"," 23 of 32 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","23","32","0","0"

While this does sound generic and simple, this is wrong. There is alot of things going on and plenty of forshadowing with some plot twists thrown in too. It is a fantastic story that keeps you drawn in because of the great cast of characters and the amazing world building that sets itself up for the sequels to come.\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is standard turn based combat with some tiny twists here and there, The orbment system in the game is pretty unique because it lets you set up your spells however you want. (If you have to compare it to something think of it as something similar to FF7's materia system) The only downside is that combat is abit slow, but that itself isnt that big of a problem.\n\nSound\nIf you are a fan of Falcom's music then you should know how good their music is. Most of the music here is nice, jazzy, and relaxing with some serious stuff thrown in too. If you have played any of Falcom's other games like Ys then this is the opposite, Theres not alot of music that gets your blood pumping but instead it makes you feel comfy.\n\nOverall i would reccomend this to people who want to enjoy a nice comfy adventure rpg with a great cast, even though the beginning of the game is slow, you will get sucked into the story and end up wanting more. Luckly the sequel should be here sometime in the future and it is amazing.\n\nId rate this game a 8/10","August 2, 2014","true","46.8"," 18 of 23 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","18","23","0","1"

A lot of text. The story has decent pacing, and I like how every chapter ends on a really strong note. It makes you feel like Estelle and Joshua more than earned their recommendations. The characters however, other than Joshua and Estelle, can be rather forgetful, even if they are somewhat charming. There's just nothing special about them. They fill their tropes and fill them well. Except Schera: she's one of the standouts. As for Joshua and Estelle, they're much better characters. They should be; the entire adventure is about them. The music is good, but not great for the most part.  (There are exceptions obviously.) Graphics are clearly not the main focus of the game, but what it does, it does well enough.\n\nBottom line: The game is pretty good for RPG fans.

While the game only represents the first chapter of what had turned into one of Nihon Falcom's most ambitious projects at the time, the game itself is solid.\n\nThe storyline is very well written and the dialogue feels far more natural between the characters than your standard JRPG fare. Unlike the standard JRPG cliché of a bunch of kids saving the world while the adults are useless, it becomes clear that they are in over their heads and are simply treading water. Also, the adults in the game are far from useless, as it becomes clear that while Estelle and Joshua, out heroes, have been busy, several of the adults in the game are busy in the background, or actually fighting.\n\nEach of the characters has their own personality quirks and their dialogue is much more natural seeming than is typical in most JRPGs. The NPCs are even more interesting in some respects, mostly because each NPC, regardless of their importance to the plot, have names and quirky personalities at times. This level of detail gives the storyline much more depth than you would expect and the amount of dialogue is MASSIVE. (no wonder the release was delayed by several months).\n\nThe combat system forces you to think more tactically, learning the weaknesses of your enemies and exploiting them, using your character's strengths wisely and covering their weaknesses. Also, the magic system, while not as intuitive as some, is very customizable and gives you a large number of options, as well as using character specific skills.\n\nIt is repetitive at times, to the point where you will find yourself avoiding combat to get past the monotony due to eventually being too overpowered. At other times, it is extremely frustrating (one boss has an achievement for beating just because he is that difficult and the plot continues regardless of whether you win or not) due to how turn orders work.\n\nAs to sidequests, this game massively averts JRPG convention by having a large number of them. All of them are event linked, some are hidden and you have to find, and all of them have time durations on them. Short time quests must be completed before the next plot event, medium duration ones can last for a good while and long duration ones must be completed before the end of the chapter. These quests are responsible for about a third of the time you will spend on the game, if not longer and it is very easy to miss some (have fun finding them 100% completionists).\n\nNow, if you will excuse me, I am going to go back to it and do a replay in New Game +\n","November 3, 2014","true","48.0"," 12 of 13 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","12","13","0","0"

Me, being the Falcom fanatic I am, was readily awaiting to double dip on FC in order to ensure Second Chapter and the rest of the series to arrive (thank you Matador for gifting me this game, I promise I'll get you something for this!).\n\nI could write a novel about this game and why is it such a masterpiece as Trails in the Sky features by far one of the most fleshed out universes I've ever seen in videogames, with a lot of attention to world detail and the overall plot of the series.\n\nThe battle system is really cool albeit slow, rewarding good turn management and seizing opportunities; it plays similar to a SRPG with grid based movement where you can at all times see when your turn is coming up next when choosing actions. Casting "Arts" (basically magic) takes up time to cast and it can be interrupted, so deciding which magic to use and when is essential. "Crafts" (character skills) consume a separate resource from Arts and are casted instantly; the most interesting one however is S-Crafts (Limit Breaks) which can be cast at any point in battle (technique called Craft Break) as long as you have the required 100 CP that it demands and should you have 200 CP the S-Craft deals additional damage or has an extra effect to it. There are also turn bonuses such as HP/MP Recovery or Critical hits and you can effectively position your next turn to take advantage of any of these. Outside of battle there's the Orbment system where placing Materia-like gems in a line defines what magic you get; line up enough fire magic in a line and you get powerful fire Arts. Orbments themselves also offer passive benefits such as attack increases or more max HP so customizing your character via Orbments is possible as long as their lines and innate stats allow your build to be viable. Then there's the Bracer Guild which are mainly sidequests and your main income of money and items; completing the tasks requested by NPCs from the Bracer Guild awards you Bracer Points which allow you to rank up in the guild, getting a handsome reward at every rank. Sidequests vary in requirements and must be completed in time before certain plot events, some are repetitive like "Kill X monster" while others are rather unique and have some cutscenes that lets us see more of our charming cast in action. Some quests also have special hidden conditions which if met will net you extra BP.\n\nGraphically, like every other Falcom game, it looks very dated. As the time of this edit, higher resolution textures and HD assets have been added which offers you what could be the best PC version of this game there ever was. The music is really good and catchy, almost relaxing as the normal battle theme Sophisticated Fight is a pretty relaxing jazz, although it does get better as the end draws near with Hollow Light of the Sealed Land being one of the greatest videogame compositions ever graced for a final dungeon. The game's main theme song Whereabouts of the Stars is a pretty great song that perfectly captures the feel of the game after its conclusion. There is some scarce voice acting, mostly as grunts and small lines during battle with only the english dub being available. It ranges from pretty good to abysmal and can be turned off.\n\nBut let's get to the real meat: the story. This game is pretty infamous about this, with over 1 million japanese characters to be translated[operationrainfall.com] and the gargantuan effort of a poor editor working full time and extra hours in order to meet the deadline[www.gameinformer.com] (thank you Jess, you are missed) Trails' plot can only be described as "huge". It is simply exquisite though, very well written and will surprise you with its ending, being an infamous cliffhanger that has left everyone who's played the game to its end wanting to play the second part already. But Trails is not just a major plot twist in the end, the game has a lot of subtle foreshadowing that doesn't only pertain to this game, but to the entire series, which is mindblowing to say the least. Then there's the NPCs, each has their own unique name and change dialogue constantly after every plot related event; they're aware of what's happening around them and often wander off to different places gladly telling you what their business is. These, while mostly useless, help the world feel more alive contrary to most JRPGs where NPCs are just there to comment on random things and don't often seem to be affected by the main plot's events.\n\nThe game's biggest downside and its most glaring flaw is the slow pace. Having a prologue of 6 hours worth of gameplay should tell you enough about how slow it is; characters tend to have lengthy conversations and the plot progresses at a snail's pace. While it starts small and mostly boils down to "helping each Bracer Guild branch out" eventually the bigger scheme is revealed and the game kicks into a faster pace.\n\nShould you purchase Trails in the Sky? It's up to you. Should you have the patience to reach the ending and awaiting the second game I truly believe you won't regret it. Trails is one of the masterpieces of JRPG in recent times and I feel it's a shame it took so long to reach our hands.","September 14, 2014","true","72.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NonToxic/recommended/251150/","NonToxic","NonToxic","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NonToxic/","129 products in account","I write this review while starting up a New Game+ playthrough, having spent about 45 hours on the first run from start to finish. Considering the game only costs $20 (and I picked it up when it was $4 off), the Value meter should already be pointing in the positive direction, but add to that my inability to catch all the sidequests in time and coffee-fuelled speed reading and it seems a real completionist could spend much longer with this title.\n\nTrails in the Sky is a JRPG about a pair of kids on an adventure. This adventure starts off simple and quickly compounds into a real international mess, which is both one of the greatest strengths and greatest weaknesses of the game. If you don't like reading, you are in the wrong part of video game land. The characters are a huge focus of the game, and the way they are developed here is outstanding. But – that means text, and lots of it. I can sit down with a knife and a fork and chew my way through even the thickest of stories, and with Trails in the Sky, the quality of that story was a real motivator. At the outset, I thought the main character was incredibly annoying. 'Oh boy,' I thought, 'another 30 hour game where I want to punch the MC every time it opens its mouth'. Yet by the end, I could not have been more wrong.\n\nThe pair of kids grows up a lot on their adventure, it is an adorably awkward teenage maturation process that the player gets to be involved in. While one main character starts off solidly in the Oblivious category, as the player solves mysteries throughout the game, choices in the text and optional  objectives make you feel like you can push them in the right direction. Sure enough, by the time the plot is done twisting (geez, like a flag in the wind), both characters have matured, and you empathize with their struggles. Then the plot twists AGAIN and a sequel emerges from the darkest shadows. If nothing else motivates the player to buy the sequel, it will be out of a desperate need to see closure for the main characters in light of fresh plot developments.\n\nIn battle, Trails in the Sky is less twisted. Along the side of the screen scroll icons for the player, their party, and whatever enemies may be. Additionally, an assortment of bonuses pop up at the bottom and eventually align with the icons. These bonuses, such as critical hit, will occur on the turn of the player (or enemy!) whose icon matches up with it at the top of the screen. This is easier to understand in action than it is to explain in text, and it spices up the battles with a bit of good old RNG, as players (and enemies!) can impact the order in which they take their turns. Each character can equip magical quartz into a limited number of slots, granting them both passive abilities and new spells to cast. If anyone remembers Golden Sun, it is similar to the djinni system.\n\nLoad up on Water quartz, and that character gets an assortment of heals, ice nukes, that type of thing. Customization is artificially limited by the gear certain characters wear (ie. A certain number of slots on a character with a predisposition towards Earth must have Earth quartz in them), but it serves to perhaps direct newbies into forming some party roles rather than cramping the style of a player who wants to experiment. I made it through the whole game with a useless Estelle because of the low-damage quartz options I had chosen for her, but in the final battle, she was one of the only characters who could survive to revive the others. Though not all setups are equal, no one should worry about having a 'bad' set of quartz – if you're willing to try, pretty much everything works!\n\nTo conclude, I do recommend this game to anyone who likes reading. For every plot point and story advancement, the people in town will tell you new stuff. If you like talking to townsfolk, running sidequests, and playing part-time detective, you will enjoy Trails in the Sky. The battles are fun (and a good few of them offer a real challenge), the story is engaging, and to put it simply, the sequel cannot arrive soon enough.\n\nAnd remember: if you're gonna puke, do it offstage.","August 8, 2014","true","53.7"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

And boy, that was an experience. Being a hardcore fanboy of RPG and especially those from Japan (because I'm a giant fat weeaboo) and played games like the original Legend of Heroes, Ys, Generation of Chaos, Persona/Shin Megami Tensei and whatnot I was very quick to pick this up from my local Gamestop back in California. I think that was the best 20 bucks I spent during that semester.\n\nTrails in the Sky is a spinoff/sidestory, or if you would like to call it the sixth game in the Legend of Heroes franschise. It's your typical turn-based JRPG with a little twist and a bit of strategy to it. Battle doesn't become too dull thanks to that and because of the "Arts" system you can customize your characters (which are quite the amount) for a specific role whenever you want to. And it is paramount for the important battles. Unless you are playing on easy. Which you shouldn't do anyway. Shame on you if you do. Like, seriously.\n\nBut then, a lot of peope play RPGs for a good storyline which Trails in the Sky does not falter at. More the opposite; albeit that it has a problem of pacing. Now, the game is divided into chapters (I actually forget how many) but the game doesn't start to pick up about halfway through and for many that can be a turnoff. But to compromise this there are a lot of other things one can do. Sidestories, extra missions, exploration. The world of Trails in the Sky is vast and extremely beautiful which is one of its selling point. It's extremely well detailed and the characters just compliments this so well. Compared to a lot of other JRPGn out here on Steam the characters are actually interesting (*cough* Agarest *cough*) Seriously, of a cast of 35 party members in Agarest only three of them were actually somewhat interesting. Now, Trails in the Sky doesn't really have THAT huge of a cast but that doesn't matter when the majority of the characters are great. But of course, it's Japan so we have some sort of stereotypical characters which you will always see. *sighs*\n\nBut those minor flaws just pales in comparison of the whole greatness of the game. It's a rich and engaging world with some actually great music (I actually have the CD with the OST, suck it ♥♥♥♥♥es!) that fits the vivid world and enhances the experience. Battle is somewhat fluid, characters actually have an interesting personality (for most part) and has an amazing story... if you can get past the first two chapters (but hey, the story isn't actually bad even from the beginning).\n\nThe experience from playing it on a PSP was great but I don't think I could experience the details from that small ♥♥♥ screen the same way I can do on a PC. I mean, holy ♥♥♥♥. The difference is amazing and I can finally enjoy both the artwork and the surroundings to its fullest potential. Only downside is that I feel like a neanderthal sitting in front of my computer and playing games with a controller. With both hands close to the crotch with the vibrating controller, I could do something else. Ya'now.\n\n9/10.

If you want to know the actual story of the game, you won't find it here, read a synopsis ; )\n\nThe story is literally a journey, that develops "organically" - if that makes any sense. It starts out small and the stakes and impact of your actions on the world gradually get bigger. The natural progression is kind of refreshing for me, since often RPGs throw your characters into situations ("You found the magic sword, now you have to save the world!") and it's something I am not too fond of.\nSo that and my impression, that the story is also well written, stick out in my mind.\n\nThe characters feel like they have actual personality and are genuinely likeable. They have their flaws, but also ambitions and strengths. Even side characters get fleshed out and all the characters togeher make the world feel alive.\n\nOther aspects that tie the game together are the great soundtrack, the fun strategic battle system and the really nice visuals, especially with the character portraits shown in dialogues that help a lot to flesh out the emotions of the characters.\n\nI'm pretty sure it's the same engine they used for the Ys games (Origin and The Oath in Felghana), so if you played those games and enjoyed the visuals, you know, what you'll get.\n\nI spent ~60 hours playing through the game a single time and enjoyed every single minute of it, so I felt the game was worth the price.","October 3, 2014","true","111.2"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The characters are well-written and likeable, the battle system is fast but has a decent amount of tactical depth, and the graphics get the job done. It is never a chore to play. There's never some element of it that feels unnecessary or excessive, unlike many JRPGs of the past several years. I must also commend the excellent mouse control - while you can play it with a gamepad, movement and menu navigation via the mouse is so simple and easy that there's just no reason to do so.\n\nWhat truly elevates Trails, though, is the attention to detail. The characters may seem like archetypes at first (the tomboy, the angsty young man with the hidden past, the wannabe-Casanova, etc), the dialogue (and there is a LOT of dialogue) makes them all feel very human and more difficult to categorize so simply. NPCs have new dialogue after every cutscene, letting you follow their little stories if you choose to do so. There's a lot of worldbuilding, too: the setting doesn't feel like it exists solely to show off impressive vistas and impossible places, but feels grounded in a very internally consistent way. While not a lot of it is forced upon you, there's a wealth of detail makes it feel far less like a playground for adventure and more like a living, breathing world.\n\nIt isn't all roses, though. While the worst of the issues that plagued the launch appear to have been solved and I haven't seen any crashes recently, there are still reports of crashing on area transitions, videos not playing correctly, and black boxes around objects. Be sure you know what you're getting into and prepare for the possibility of having to work to get a stable and playable game. It's worth it, though.","July 30, 2014","true","65.3"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","12"

It really has everything going for it--a sweeping soundtrack, excellent spritework, and a world that changes around you as you complete even the smallest story events.  I can't emphasize enough how much work went into minor NPC dialog.  After every cutscene, basically everybody in every zone has something new to talk about.  If you're anything like me, you'll be making a lot of trips back around all of the unlocked map to talk to everyone over and over in a circuit.  I really enjoy the little bits of worldbuilding that you get out of every little conversation.\n\nIn the same vein as the dialog, new missions crop up all the time too.  Sometimes you find them on the local guild job board, and sometimes you find them out talking to people in the wild.  Some are just basic "Go to X, kill monster Y," but others actually involve the characters you've been talking to all this time.  You know how that cook has been claiming lately that his food shipments haven't arrived?  Well here's a (story) mission that addresses that!  That lady that is always napping outside the cafe with her cat?  Her cat's missing, find it!  (And her awkward flirting with Joshua is reward enough for that little quest...)\n\nI think the battle system is very FF7-ish, with what are basically materia gems, which some will find a nice throwback, and others will think is unoriginal.  Originality aside, I enjoy the gem system for the nuance it adds to the combat system, with multiple similarly colored gems slotted-in resulting in more powerful spells.\n\nThe initial release of the game was kinda rocky.  The game started off with a lot of glitches that have mostly been ironed out as far as I can tell, and the game is constantly being enhanced beyond being a simple re-issue of the original old Japanese version.  They've added a number of very nice HD character portraits, and menus look really nice and crisp.  Overall, I wouldn't let the earlier glitches drive you away from this great game.","August 25, 2014","true","148.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Initially, I only decided to buy this game because I thought it looked interesting and vaguely resembled the earlier Final Fantasy games (IV, V & VI). In reality, this game provides what I believe is missing in many RPG's nowadays including Final Fantasy.\n\nStory (no spoilers):\nThe story within Trails in the Sky I would say is a perfect balance between several important factors which should be present in all RPG's: complexity and depth whilst still being succint and avoiding cliches and troupes. To put if briefly without going into actual plot points, although the story itself involves tons of twists and turns with moderately unpredicatable storytelling and dark themes such as conspiracy, it always remains understandable by using character interaction to explain the narrative. The game itself consists of 5 chapters, each with its own main story but with an overarching storyline that runs throughout the game. The game includes easily the best storyline and storytelling I have ever played in a video game, so anyone interested in buying the game I would advise not to search any details of it to avoid massive spoilers. The ending of the game will DEFINITELY make you eagerly await the second chapter's English localisation - I know I am!\n\nCharacters:\nEasily my second favourite aspect of the game. While the game does to some extent include the standard 'funny character,' 'shy character,' 'reckless character' etc seen within most RPG's, the difference with this game is that each character is genuinly believable and extremely funny, with Estelle and Joshua (the two main protagonists) complimenting each other brilliantly. It is clear that the developers intended to really focus on developing the feelings and emotions of each and every character, even if Olivier can be unbearable sometimes. Trails is probably the first RPG in which I felt compelled to listen to as many NPC's as possible just to hear what they have to say and how the main characters will respond. Whilst there is tons of text reading (which is a good thing in my opinion), story and character development are the strongest aspects of this game.\n\nBattle system:\nI've read that some people disliked the battle system, but personally I felt it is among the most creative and enjoyable variations of the traditional turn based system I have ever played. Firstly, you do not face random encounters! A typical battle begins by accidentally or intentionally running into a visible enemy while walking down roads. Battles comprise of a square grid requiring you to strategically position your characters and use basic attacks, sepith (magic) or S-breaks and crafts (ridiculously strong special attacks) against the enemy. There's a slight learning curve for anyone more familiar with traditional JRPG battle systems like in Pokemon or Final Fantasy, but its easily solved by after your fast few battles. The enemies you face vary in skills and strength and consequently the game requires you to vary your battle technique very often, especially leading up to boss battles. Its really one of those games in which are easier to learn as you go along rather than using tutorials and guides.\n\nGameplay and graphics:\nDefinitely one of the most beautifully crafted JRPG's I have played in a long time. From playing this game, it is clear that beautiful scenary and ambience can be created with simple artistic design. The game is predominantly open world, but with clear guidance as to where to go and what to do. Its just a really enjoyable game to play and experience aside from the characters and story.\n\nMusic:\nThis game has one of the greatest soundtracks (in my opinion) of any game ever released. I believe that every game should have a certain degree of repeition in regards to its music, and Trails in the Sky has the perfect amount. Each major city has its own unique soundtrack that leaves you looking forward to the subsequent city just to hear what music comes along with it. Its a shame, I can't find anywhere to buy the soundtrack because the music is one of the things which makes this game standout from the crowd.\n\nIt is usually very easy to pick out flaws in a game, but honestly, Trails in the Sky is in my opinion one of those rare games that only exist once every few years which I struggle to find criticisms for. Its a JRPG that just works! My only real disappointment is the lack of publicity about this game. I only discovered it by chance and immediatly persuaded a friend to buy it - he wasn't disappointed! This is my first review and the quality of this game and its lack of publicity compelled me to write about it. To conlude, anyone who wants an experience which resembles that of classic RPG's from Chrono Trigger, to Finaly Fantasy and even extending to games such as Earthbound will love this hidden gem, but the game is one which doesn't limit itself to JRPG fans, because the characters, story and overall experience is something which anyone can enjoy.","July 20, 2015","true","51.6"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

This game is a near-perfect refinement of the classic JRPG formula: chat up characters, fight and grind through turn-based battles, and save the world. It may not be ground-breaking, but Trails in the Sky shines in its execution: the turn-based battles favor planning, good positioning and clever tactics, and the world is rich with memorable, endearing and just plain odd characters (even townsfolk) whose personalities really stand out thanks to XSEED's excellent localization. No ham-fisted moral choices, no convoluted weapon crafting, just a good, solid RPG experience.","December 24, 2014","true","48.7"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","67","12","18","18","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DigiModify13/recommended/251150/","DigiModify13","Butter-fly","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DigiModify13/","39 products in account","I have heard many things about this game before its PC release, from people who have played the PSP version. One side promised that I’d experience incredible world-building, a wonderful soundtrack, and a fantastic story with endearing characters. Another side made it seem like the pacing was trash and that the story and characters were nothing but a bunch of cliché anime tropes. Now that I’ve experienced the game myself, I would consider this one of the best JRPGs I have ever played. My hope is that this review will convince those who are skeptical about the praise for The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky (like I was) to try it out for themselves.\n\nLet’s start with the characters. I’m a sucker for female protagonists, and Estelle Bright is as good as they get.  Tomboyish, sassy, and somewhat ditzy at the beginning, she alone makes the narrative rather amusing. Her travelling companion, Joshua Bright, is practical, talented, and much more reserved – a perfect foil for Estelle. There are many other important characters along the way who come and go, and you don't have much of a choice when it comes to who is or isn't in your party.  There are also a ton of NPC characters, and their dialogue will change as you make progress in the story, making the in-game universe feel alive. Having followed all sorts of anime, I’m the type of person who drops something just because of bland characters and overused gimmicks/jokes.  I didn’t take much offense to any of the characters in this game, so I’d say the people who bash this for being overly cliché are just being unnecessarily harsh. Nothing particularly groundbreaking, but tried and true archetypes are used to perfection, and the top quality translation pops.\n\nNow, about the story and setting.  This game is divided into 1 prologue and 4 chapters (5 parts in total). You move to a new region in the country of Liberl in each chapter, and there's pretty much no turning back. The game looks pretty good, given its age, although the scenery in locations between towns can be on the bland side. There’s this claim that the first 4 parts are slice of life, and things don’t really get interesting until near the end, and that's not entirely true. What it really is, is slice of life with plenty of world building, setting up, and well placed foreshadowing woven into it. This game is the first game in the trilogy of a bigger series, and this whole game is essentially a prologue for Trails in the Sky: Second Chapter (which is about twice the length and apparently much better paced). The folks over at Falcom (the developer) make no effort appease the folks who want instant gratification. Hints about later events and even later games are present throughout, and there’s lots of optional reading that really broadens your understanding of Liberl and its surrounding countries, giving you the opportunity to connect the dots when the rest of the games in the series come over. Pieces of the puzzle are thrown at you from the very beginning of the game, and it’s damn rewarding to see some of them falling into place at the end.\n\nIn the gameplay department, there are a ton of missables, so following some sort of guide is more or less a necessity. You don’t have to sweat it on your first playthrough though, since there is a New Game + feature and a ton of optional quests that you’ll likely skip the first time around anyway. The battle system here is definitely refreshing for those who are tired of traditional turn-based. Once again, nothing groundbreaking. The battles aren’t the main attraction of this game, but they're still quite fun to do, and you'll want to really understand how orbments work because the upcoming sequel is more difficult and will expect you to know how to manipulate it.\n\nIn Trails in the Sky: First Chapter, Falcom has built an absurdly detailed world with a masterful narrative that makes it clear that the best has yet to come. If investing in a fictional universe is your kind of thing, you owe it to yourself to give this a shot.","September 16, 2014","true","121.4"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

It gives you a world to explore with great dialogue that changes with each event. The battle system is simple but at the same time complex once you begin trying to maximize each character's strengths. While you can power level in a few select places, the enemies are always a good match. Bosses are spaced well and the timed quest system is interesting. You must complete some quests before others or lose the chance to do them at all.

Is it good? Short answer? OH MY JESUS ♥♥♥♥ YES!!\n\nLong answer? This game is in my top 5 that I've ever played. Not only does it kill the itch I've been getting for some good old classic JRPGs, but it has surpassed all of my expectations by a ton! This may not be the game for you if you don't like heavily story driven games, but if you do this game is a must play.\n\nI feel like I need to address a few elephants in the room before I continue though. First, the game starts very slow story wise. This won't mean anything to you now but everyone who's completed this game knows that you need to play until the play. Second, I feel like a few of the sidequests may require a brief look at a walkthrough to complete (or maybe I'm just dumb but whatever).\n\nNow we get back to business. The gameplay is excellent for those of you who love tactical RPGs like XCOM and Fire Emblem. On harder difficulties, it requires you to really think outside the box and employ some pretty unconventional strategies. To sum it up, the gameplay is like Fire Emblem meets Final Fantasy VII.\n\nNow, we get to the real selling point of the game.The story makes this game truly shine above soooo many other games.  The characters and dialogue are just incredibly well written to the point that you could probably just copy and paste the dialogue into a book and it'd be pretty well received. Also, a big thing that stands out within this absolute gem is that it tackles some pretty mature subjects without absolutely royally ♥♥♥♥ing it up.\n\nAnyways, to sum it up, this is one of the most criminally underrated games of all time by far. It is easily worth the $20 and if you love yourself some classics like Final Fantasies VI and VII, Chrono Trigger, and Fire Emblem, you'll love this game.","January 27","true","58.9"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

What it does do is polish the concept and execution without leaving a single detail unattended to.  Absolutely nothing is wasted or frivolous in its design.  The designers set out to take the concept of a "classic" JRPG and polish it into the best possible version they could make it and, as far as I'm concerned, they succeeded.\n\nThe character system is the same stat, level, and gear laddered system we've all been using for a while now.  Where it differs here is there are no frivolous upgrades, levels mean a lot, and every single stat point is a marked increase in capability.  The level of improvement is like discussing levels and gear in Dungeons and Dragons.  A single level can turn an enemy which will take off 50% of your hit points in a hit down to one which will only take off 20% in a hit.  A new weapon will make you go from killing an enemy in five hits down to two.  Armor upgrades will make an enemy inflict *tink* damage instead of significantly harming your characters.  There is no waste in the character screen, every weapon and item produces a noticeable upgrade in the performance of your characters which will give you an advantage over your adversaries.\n\nEnemy encounters can be seen on the area maps and will transition to the classic battle screen.  Combat is turn based on a tactical grid.  The grid does little more than provide positioning for aoe and melee attacks.  Experience from the fights is rewarded scaled to level to keep you from wasting time grinding experience and at some point when you reach a soft experience cap, you are encouraged to avoid combat and the encounters.\n\nSpells have to be set up in a materia system on each character.  Each materia provides a stat upgrade, which even on the small end is significant and noticeable, and determine the spell list for a character.  Spells are usually powerful, magic points are limited for each character, they are one of the few sources of AoE damage, healing, and even more importantly - status effects.  Yes, stat effects can change the tide of a battle if they are done in your favor or against it, something I rarely see in a JRPG.  Spells have to be charged when cast and they will require you to "wait" a number of ticks on the turn order in order to cast them.\n\nEach character also has their own number of abilities, which use a resource charged when they attack or take damage, like a limit gauge.  Some of these are weaker abilities doing better than average damage or applying a status effect.  When the gauge is 100% or more full they can cut ahead in the turn order and activate an ultimate ability doing a lot of damage, sometimes aoe damage, party healing for one character, at any time during combat.\n\nThe story is a tight story focused on the characters and character development.  The smallness and focus reminds me of The Witcher.  The scene doesn't paint a grand, sweeping save the world narrative.  It presents a smaller narrative involved with the politics, issues, concerns of the protagonists, their companions, and the people they come across.  Even the story is limited, you don't save the world, you resolve a political crisis in the kingdom your characters call home.  Most of the interaction you have with this larger story take the form of resolving problems in whatever area you happen to be in for the various people who live there.\n\nThe people and the world is well-developed, everyone has significant lines of dialogue.  All the NPCs have a name and consistent personality - there are NO extras.  If you set out and find NPC's to talk to, they always react to the latest developments of the plot, comment on what they think or how it affects their lives.  The game holds onto little details of who you've talked to, who you've helped, what optional things you've done, and who wants ice cream, as you wander around the towns and countryside.  Even better, the game doesn't punish you for missing these details, it tries to keep them as a reward or a "do you remember when-" moment for those who go finding things off the beaten path.  If you try to push forward without being hung up on what's on the side, that's fine - the game gives you what you need to work on the next quests and enough knowledge of the world to move on without being stopped by anything.\n\nI have very few issues with this game.  First, there are some FPS/stutters and drops in certain areas.  I understand there are some settings and fixes for this if you take the time to do them - they weren't so much of a problem for me I went through that effort.  Second, the final area of the game is very "Zen Syndrome".  There is a large dungeon there, way larger than several dungeons combined with some very hard enemies there.  It wouldn't normally be a problem, but the other areas of the game were more intelligently developed with interesting story and encounters in them.  This last area is just four levels of hard random encounters with a few bosses combined with story to hand you as a reward for your effort.\n\nThis is probably one of the best JRPG's I've played in the 2000's, one of the best you will find on the PC platform, and one I'm glad I got the opportunity to play.","January 11","true","65.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Fleshing out the characters, and giving them a proper reason for what they are doing.\n\nTrails in the Sky is different. This game is very slow paced... But that's the appeal of it. It never rushes to do anything. It takes it's time to build a coherent world, give everything a meaning and introduce many various characters. Who develops nicely throughout the game.\n\nThe main characters are Estelle Bright and her adopted brother, Joshua Bright. They are raised by their father, Cassius Bright, to become full fledged Bracers.\n\nBracers are guild members who are tasked to protect the well being of their fellow citizens and country. In this case, Liberl. A small and peaceful kingdom, that got invaded by the Erebonian Empire 10 years ago. In what was essentially called ''The Hundred Days War.''\n\nLiberl suffered heavy losses, but still managed to drive the Empire back and survive the invasion. With the help of the military and strong support from the Bracer guild.\n\nBut at the cost of many lives, like Estelle's mother. This is what pushed Estelle into becoming a Bracer, if not only for her father. To become strong and experienced, so she can protect her friends, country and most importantly, her family. From another invasion attempt.\n\nLots of Jrpgs tend to focus way too much on the main characters and not enough on non-playable ones, but not in this game.\n\nFor instance, you are introduced to two news reporters within the first 2 hours of the game, Nial and Dorothy. They both have their own unique personality, character portrait and goal in their mind, with a lot of dialogue there to explain said goal in detail. From all this, we can assume they are somewhat important and MIGHT play a bigger role later in the game.\n\nA lot of the characters you meet in the game are portrayed like this, and this is one of the many strengths of the game. To make every character look even a tiny bit important, whether they are friendly or not.\n\nAnd in most cases, even when our heroes are faced with enemies that are human, they don't kill them. They stop them or knock them out. This helps present our heroes... As actual HEROES.\n\nThis is a great way to empathize with the characters we are in control of. It would be a bit hard to empathize with murderers.\n\nThis is what the game is good at. Creating a world that is detailed, introduce characters that are detailed and to explain things in detail. To build upon things, further and further, until the end.\n\nIf you can deal with the slow pace of the battle system in the beginning, you will really enjoy it later on. Opening more orbment slots, inserting Quartz (Materia in this game), getting new Arts (spells in this game) and that kinda stuff makes it fun to experiment with in battle later on.\n\nIt has cliches like any other game/anime, but that's not a bad thing. It's how writers handle these cliches. And I think, Trails in the Sky handles it better than anything I've ever seen and played.\n\nI'm not really good at writing detailed reviews, but I hope this made you somewhat more interested in the game.\n\nThe Legend of Heroes is a very well written, story rpg series. And I hope it can get more support here in the west, so we can get the rest of the games released over here.","August 1, 2014","true","81.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

It's really dialogue-heavy and could use some editing but it eventually engrosses the player in the world.\n\nTrails In The Sky also has one of the worst combat systems ever put into an RPG. So many stupid design decisions -  positioning is important yet you cannot decide from where you attack, you can either move where you want or attack. The AI cheats blatantly, the enemies are spongy to the point where they have 20,000 HP (when your characters have around 3000). Spell animations are long and you'll see them thousands of times making fighting a chore. I beat Persona 4 few months ago and Trails has nothing on that game where it comes to combat systems.\n\nThat's the main flaw. I've invested lots of hours in the game already but didn't finish it.

Estelle and Joshua aspire to become Bracers which are basically civil workers who do good deeds/jobs for the good of the people (different from the Royal Army whose main purpose is to protect the people from monsters). We follow them around to different regions (as Bracers-in-training) solving people's problems like escorting civilians safely to towns, doing errands like finding some books, fixing things, exterminating strong monsters etc.\n\nOn this journey we meet many friends along the way and I can safely say I found something likeable for every single character- even the overly flirtatious guy at the expense of his misfortune and his banter with the party members. All the characters grow on you as the game goes on and you genuinely feel sad/happy when things go wrong or right for them- which not many current generation JRPGs do thats for sure. This gem of a game has touched my heart and I don't regret every single minute of my life joining Estelle and Joshua on their journey to become full-fledged Bracers.\n\nI highly recommend this game to not only those tired of the overly moe JRPGs made nowadays but also those that want a nice story about 2 teens on a quest to do what they think is right with all the laughs and tears in between. I rate this a 9/10. Pros and Cons list below for those interested.\n\nPros:\n+THE. FREAKING. TREASURE. CHESTS. - If you thought looting chests and getting great loot was awesome, well; let's just say the chests themselves have something to say about that...\n+ Diverse Characters - from NPCS all the way to playable party members, there's so many different people to love/like!\n+ Diverse Enemies - no rinse and repeat monster models for EVERY REGION. There are a few but generally each region has different monsters and thats sweet.\n+ Gameplay - the gameplay is pretty neat; nice turn-based battle grid system with interrupting-turn super skills\n+ EXP system - This game does leveling right. The exp gained from monsters is based on a exp scaling system so if you are underleveled (let's say lvl 18) fighting a lvl 20 mob, you get more exp than if you were level 21 fighting the same mob. This prevents you from being too underleveled but at the same time prevents overleveling (to an extent).\n+ Story is good (albeit linear)\n+ OST is great\n+ Graphics can be upped to 1080p x 1920p\n+ $20!!! - considering the price of current JRPGs go for at least around $30 usually; this game is certainly a steal for the amount of content.\n\nCons:\n- Linear story - you get story locked which prevents you from going back to the previous regions once you pass certain points in the story.\n- Some party members you've had in early chapters are unplayable until late in the Final chapter.\n- Graphics are dated (the game is old- released in 2004) I personally don't mind but for some people graphics/looks is a factor.\n- Few bugs - there was a point where I would talk to an NPC and one of my party members would walk/run in place; pretty funny and not that big a deal but a bug nonetheless.\n- No Voice Acting - This isn't as big a deal as let's say in a Visual Novel but besides battle voices and grunt noises, there is NO voice acting.\n- This is the First Chapter and the Second and Third Chapters have yet to be released in English (although Second Chapter is currently being localized).","January 6, 2015","true","65.8"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

It's great. The battle system is decent, albeit very easy. The atmosphere is perfect; the game does an excellent job of capturing the feeling of an adventure of discovery, and while the story is slow-paced up until the second half, it's fitting for the tone of the game. The characters are all endearing and likable, and relatively fleshed out for their screentime. The world is absolutely one of the most detailed and believable ever presented in a videogame, with a lot of complexity and minutiae to discover. Every NPC has their own small storyline that runs parallel to the main plot, which makes the world feel so much more alive than most games where NPCs are hardly anything more than decorations. The music is relaxing and enjoyable - even the battle theme is smooth and jazzy - up until the game gets serious and it changes pace to fit that. The character interactions are absolutely fantastic and there's a lot of subtlety to the way the story and characterization is presented, especially in the foreshadowing department. All in all you're doing yourself a massive disservice if you pass this game up and consider yourself in any way to be a fan of RPGs or detailed story-based games, as the series is one of the absolute best in that department. Trails in the Sky is the weakest game in the series in terms of gameplay and the third weakest in the story and character department, but it's still an incredibly enjoyable experience. Also, the sequel is crazy ♥♥♥♥ing good.","February 9, 2015","true","37.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","2"

I enjoyed this game quite a bit because I feel there are so many excellent game mechanic descisions, but I couldn't help but be overall disapointed, only because of the radiant reviews I had read prior to purchasing the game. The music was okay, sometimes I felt like I was listening to an rpg sound track that has been turned to elevator music. The light jazzy battle music actually got a little old about 5 hours in. Creatures in this game are split between a busy mess of horns and tentacles (which can look cool), or just a lazy mix between two real animals. For instance, there are two seperate creature models in the game that are BOTH a shark/gator mix, and their names are actually shark-gator and gator-shark within game, which seems a little... lame. For the most part it really is a good game, I loved the recipe system and the quick turn based strategy battles were fun, and the lack of random encounters was refreshing. Also the materia-like magic system was fun to play with, but not as deep as I'd hoped. I'm a little jaded that the game ended just as it seemed to be getting good, as I figured that this game would be long as the descriptions I've read, but they fail to mention that it's actually a series of seperate titles that make one long game. This game can be finished handily within 30-40 hours without much effort and if you're familiar. The story was pretty lack luster until the final couple chapters, but the writting is actually very good and contextually sensitive to what you've already finished or achieved before engaging in conversation. My final impression of the game is that it is built upon excellent game mechanics, but the final product feels incomplete despite it's good writting. If you like anime humor or anime plot lines, then you'll enjoy this game just for that.","October 18, 2014","true","160.0"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

And for a long time I've said that Baldur's Gate was the best RPG ever written, but I think I have to revise that as of now...\n\nI'm not far yet in Legends of Heroes (just left Bose to invesigate the lost skyship), but I can already tell that it's a very well written RPG. Though the story still has to unfold for me, the dialogues are what I'm basing my statement upon. They're very well written and each character shows it's own personality. Add to that the HUGE amount of (unintentional?) humor in them and it's a story to enjoy. I even have to convess that Legends of Heroes is one of the few games that's made me laugh a lot when reading the dialogues between the characters.\n\nGraphical wise it's very dated though, but I thikn it sticks to the true jRPG feeling where story is more important than graphics. I gotta say though that even with the outdated graphics, the engine is used very well (considering this is a  pretty old game), where you can rotate the camera, but your characters stay in isometric view.\n\nThe music is pretty much okay, though not up to 'current standards'. But for me, much like the graphics, it stays true to the old jRPG feeling the game intends to deliver.\n\nI'm only sad though that I've wasted so much time on other - a lot less appealing - games lately and didn't take the time to play this one. That'll change and when I've finished this one I'll go straight on to the Second Chapter...","December 10, 2015","true","14.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","2"

The game got a good cast too, no characters are really annoying or act like a stupid brat. A nice touch is that NPCs often change what they say as you progress, unlike most JRPGs where NPCs say the same thing over and over.\n\nThe soundtrack is unfortunately the weakest part of the game. It's not bad and fill it's purpose well enough as no songs feel out of place or anything, but compared to many other JRPGs that often have great soundtracks, this is pretty average with no songs being that special. More songs wouldn't hurt either, for a game you play 40-50 hours they get a bit repetitive.

I've always been a big fan of position-based RPGS, although lacked skill in playing them. What I meant earlier that it still held remanents of the model is that positioning is just a way of balancing weapon range, arts (might as well be called magic), and speed. This makes the game feel like a traditional JRPG although the gameplay is completely different, which makes this game a whole lot better in my opinion.\n\nWhen I first started the game, there were two surprises that I wasn't expecting. One was the great design of the GUI overlay, and the second was the graphics. Simply put, the graphics in this game are initially off-putting. As soon as I saw the low poly count of props, I was immediately reminded of PSP games emulated on the PC. Low and behold, this was a PSP conversion over to PC. However, what it makes up in low poly count props and pixelated walls are HD character pictures and fairly well done character models. I'd say the latter was more important in terms of graphics, since I quickly got used to the environmental graphics. The visuals of the games are one of the only small cons that I saw in this game, so it was no big deal.\n\nThe overarching storyline is pretty good. Two "bracers" (basically adventurers) end up setting off on a journey in solving Liberal's (the country) problems, and meet many companions/enemies along the way. There's alot of character development going on between every character interaction, keeping me intrigued to the plotline at all times. There are moments of tensity, sorrow, and laughter. I only see a problem in the classic "deus ex machina" in alot of scenarios (if you've played the game, you know what I'm talking about). Overall, plot is very good and intriguing but I find it would be more compelling without the sudden "I actually had a trump card all along!" points.\n\nThe battle system, as in all JRPGs, are what takes the cake. The customizability of each character is insane, with hundreds of combinations possible. The game even gives you a BOOK that has 3 pages  which tells you what combination of orbments make what spells. Attacking is very simple, reminding me more of final fantasy than fire emblem, and keeps the gameplay easy to learn yet still involve a measurable amount of skill. My only complaint is that monster patterns are limited and repetitive after fighting several battles in the same area (which is probably why you can avoid them, but sometimes it's needed to fight for XP/items). Otherwise, I loved the traveling/battle system greatly over "walk a certain amount of steps before reaching another random encounter" system. I could go into greater detail of the battle system, but you'd learn it anyway if you just play the damn game.\n\nThe biggest issue I found playing this game was compatibility. It took me half a hour to search up solutions to why this game would crash immediately after running at first. This game should at least include a help/FAQ compartment inside that gives off solutions, since I believe not all gamers know of "forums". Nonetheless, this game is worthwhile if you ever get it to run. Highly recommend buying it. It's 50+ hours of addictive content, with additional playtime if you want to get every achievement. Now one of my favorite JRPGs I've ever played.","January 6, 2015","true","52.9"," 8 of 12 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","8","12","0","0"

But there's a reason generic elements are so ubiqutous: when someone that knows what they're doing uses them, they work really well. And Falcom knows what they're doing. The combat system is rather pedestrian, but if you're playing this game for the combat, well, like they say back home, you're doing it wrong.\n\nI've seen multiple places describe this game as being "huge", particularly concerning the story, but a better adjective would be "rich". You're not going to get an 100 hour epic with universal implications, you're not going to get miles upon miles of ingame territory filled to the brim with secrets, but you will get a vivid and powerful experience, most notably in the story, and especially with the writing. Believe the hype on that count, the writing in this game is an absolute masterclass.\n\nI've also seen a lot of places compare this to Tales of Symphonia, and while I see where they're coming from, the similarities are pretty superficial in my opinion. They're both fantastic games though.\n\nIf you like JRPGs, you should buy this game. Not to "support JRPGs on Steam" or whatever, but because it's a freaking good JRPG. You shouldn't need to buy it to make a statement, you should buy it to enjoy it.\n\nI'm really glad I waited this long to play the game, because if I had played it back in July, hoo-boy. The wait for SC would have been a killer. It's a killer now, and I beat the game last night.\n\nFinally, thank you so much to XSEED for taking a chance on this game, it truly has been a pleasure to experience, and I'll be handing you my money for SC with a smile on my face.","February 24, 2015","true","109.9"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","0"

The plot is simple, engaging, and well-crafted, but it really hooks you in because of its characters. If you take a few seconds to open yourself up to the characters, you'll find that they're really quite extensively shaped through the game's dialogue. The two protagonists are both fleshed out nicely and work very believably together. The combat systems are fairly robust, and the orbal system (by which you gain the ability to use spells and get some passive buffs) is done well, even though these systems really start to shine in the game's sequel/second chapter.\n\nThe PC port of this game (it was originally a PSP game, as I recall) is extremely efficient. Toasters and microwaves could run this game easily. Many standard options for PC versions of games that you'd expect are there, and the controls for the game give you enough control to play the game with no trouble at all; most of the time you could play the game with one hand if you rebind all your keys for use near WASD (or you can control the game entirely with your mouse).\n\nIf you're one of those weenies that cares about your JRPGs being too tropey or whatever, you don't really have to worry about that. There's nothing that's gonna ruffle your delicate feathers in this game, and it's really not anything you'd see in a cheap anime. There are a few elements borrowed from culture at large and some clever extrapolation can get you figuring out some of the twists before they happen, but you're mostly going to be in the dark.\n\nExpect a cliffhanger ending, since the game is and always has been part of a planned trilogy. Completing the game, however, is still quite satisfying, and I really do think that most fans of the JRPG and SRPG genres will quite like this game. I CERTAINLY did.","June 19, 2015","true","73.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This is their main component, so to speak: they appear in front of you suddenly, when your soul aren’t ready for waterfall of feelings and when you are most vulnerable.\n\nBut there are exceptions even among ideal pieces of work: they are just too perfect. «Sora no Kiseki» is most vivid example. You’ve dreamt about such kind of game, you didn’t know about its existence, but there it is — you watch first cutscene (made with nipponese dedication to details) with lil’ Estelle, and in the next breath you become a part of the big journey into the ocean of all sorts of human nature.\n\nAnd what I‘ve dreamt about before I encountered with «Trails in the Sky»? What principles lies in the foundation of those dreams? First of all, it is a ginormous strategy, which creators know how minimise your megalophobia by turn each five acts of odyssey to completely new experience. Relying on your skill of empathy, authors engage you in «to-the-moon» family story, detective investigation with peaceful lunch on the mesmerizing shore or restoration of Eastern-like spirit on good-old hot springs.\n\nSecondly, it has a unique graphic and art styles thanks to which you can see and feel battles, relationships, the theatrical production and, for example, diminutiveness of the one adorable inventor in all glory. Furthermore, «unique» is adjective for all aspects of videogames that made with great love and zeal: soundtrack and characters, design of monsters and towns, background of sidequests and even minor events. Your heart melt every time when Joshua is playing on harmonica. You become excited as often as new inimitable person joins in your party.\n\nAnd, you know, next thing isn’t third and not even tenth. «The Legend of Heroes» is way too big — too deep — for just citation of facts. It is only first chapter of trilogy and you already have immeasurable impressions and obligation to return in majestic Liberl to be drowned in another 50-hours atmospheric trial.\n\nWhat I got to say? It is a curse. When your childhood was marked by «Front Mission 3», jRPG have become ever present part of your life. This curse is above price, and you need to say thanks for it.","January 25, 2015","true","68.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","3","3","2","2"

Some of your typical RPG tropes with a few twists and turns throughout the story that keep them fresh and entertaining. Trails is definitely worth the money for any RPG fan. While it may not be redefining the genre; it delivers all the elements you may know and love as an RPG fan in a lively, fun-filled adventure with memorable characters and great dynamic between them all.\n\nThe combat system is fun and engaging. If you find the leveling and combat system to be complicated, you may want to start out with some really simple RPGs first to ease into the genre, or just realize that maybe RPGs are not for you. Having a range of movement which can dictate whether or not you may land an attack, for instance, adds a layer of strategy that forces you to think through some of the actions you may want to take, especially in some of the more vital fights - rather than just mashing melee attack and cleaving through your enemies.\n\nThis is a world of magic, ingenuity and intrigue that delivers on a superior level. One of the best pure RPGs that I've played in the last 10 years. If you're a fan of Eastern RPGs, do yourself a favor and pick Trails in the Sky up. I'd wager you will get 2-3 solid playthroughs of the game, if you're a completionist, or 1 very memorable experience otherwise.","March 12, 2015","true","72.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

But mainly, the only RPGs I have every really played, were Action RPGs that focused on free flowing combat and skill to take down the most difficult of bosses.\n\nNow I'm no stranger to Japanese action RPGs, but as for turn-based stuff, Trails in the Sky FC was my very first 'experience' with the turn-based formula from beginning to end, and I am very, very glad I gave JRPGs a second chance to win me over.\n\nTrails in the Sky is unlike any game you've ever played. Like most JRPGs, you will experience the inner conflicts of the protagonist, trying to establish their place in the world, along with love, death, betrayal, and hidden pasts and motives. But lots of times, to build up such a large story, development in other areas of the game that can be considered important can sometimes be neglected.\n\nHowever, with Trails, the story is rich, deep, epic, and most importantly, it breathes life and balance into other areas of the adventure that sometimes aren't developed more. This is world-building at it's finest. Townsfolk that change dialogue after finishing new missions, and other characters that join Estelle and Joshua on their journey that you'll always remember fondly until the very end. This game is one of the few titles where my eyes water during certain scenes, which is a testament to how well developed the story is, and how your attachment to the characters builds, and stays with you through to the end.\n\nThis game is very, very long, and it's only the first game out of three, but aside from the story, the turn based combat system just feels amazing. Strategy/Tactical RPG fans will notice the grid based battlefield when planning a character's attack, which adds quite a bit of flexibility to your strategies when fighting, but unit placement is nowhere near as important as it is in a game like Agarest. Combat is simple, fun, and never seems to get dull or boring.\n\nThe Orbment system also adds flexibility because you can build your characters into roles you want them to serve. Want to build a balanced team of healing, buffing, and DPS? You got it. Want to have a more DPS heavy team? You can do it. The orbment system is very fun to play with, and the huge amount of Quartz gems make for tons of different combinations to experiment and play with in battle.\n\nOverall, Trails in the Sky is a game with the deepest character development I've ever seen in an RPG, a fun and simple battle system, and one hell of an epic storyline that will board you on the feels train all the way to the very end. For the first game of a trilogy in the Trails arc, I cannot recommend this game enough. $20 for 60+ hours of enjoyment well spent. And supporting localization for more amazing titles to come on PC!\n\nNow to wait patiently until Second Chapter.","August 6, 2014","true","60.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","2"

(or review ... ^^)\n\nNow that I already was on the same spot as you are now, I now want to cover some point of what you have to expect.\n\nFirst off, I have now finshed the game, which took me about 40 hours so I can confidently say I know the game a bit ;)\n\nThese are the points I want to cover:\n-) Story\n-) Gameplay\n-) Controls\n-) Graphics\n-) Sound\n-) Conclusion\n\n-) Story\nYou know that feeling when reading a good book and don't want to stop because you wanna know what happens next ? Well, welcome to The Legend of Heroes !\nIt is really a very well written story with a lot of emotion. You can expect a rollercoaster ride with your heart once you are fallen with the characters. There is everything you want from a good story: love, hate, friendship, betrayal and tons of unexcpected events which makes it hard to stop playing.\nEven the NPCs (they don't deserve the name in this game as each and every of them as a personal story) are inflicted in the story and make it more complex.\nThe only drawback is that this game only covers the first part of the trilogy (the other two part may arrive on steam too)\nI do not want to tell any of the story here as you should experience it for yourself ;)\nA little warning tough: If you don't like a lot of reading and and a deep an long story you are maybe wrong at this game.\n\nTL;DR: If you are fed up from shooter games with ♥♥♥♥♥♥ story, feel free to jump in a game which will blow your mind.\n\n-) Gameplay\nI would call the gameplay genre standard. It is a typical jrpg with turn based combat system. There is everything from basic attacks over special attacks (which are specific for every playable character) and magic (which is available through so called orbments). If you are familiar with the grandia series then you know how it works in this game. The game is not too hard nor too easy and has tons of quests and sidequests which you should complete to get more money to invest in better equiment and items to improve the stats of the characters. Important: You can beat the game without having to farm monsters. Speaking of monsters: The game is splitted in different areas called maps. Maps can be towns, passways, caves, buildings etc. and may contain enemys. You have to defeat enemys to make progress in the game and level up your character, which also increases stats.\n\n-) Controls\nI am using the Xbox 360 Controller and the only thing that I have done is reassigning the X,Y,A and B buttons as it was not 100% comfortable at default.\nOther that that the controls work flawlessly.\nI cannot say how this game plays with keyboard and mouse as I didn't use them at all.\n\n-) Graphics\nThe graphics are beautiful and look good, similar to the grandia series.\nXSEED recently started patching the games with HD textures (as stated on their facebook page), so it should get even better over time.\nIt supports high resolution screens and I can safely say I had no issues and/or crashing the whole 40 hours.\n\n-) Sound\nI really enjoyed the orchestral soundtrack, which underlines and supports the story and makes it even more intense and dramatic. Be ready to get epic battle music when the big bosses show up.\nOther than that, the music is a little bit repetitive but it was not that big of a deal.\nP.s: the whole soundtrack is located in game directory (folder "BGM") and features high quality .ogg files.\n\n-) Conclusion\nIf you like JRPGs or you want to take a break from the plain old shooter games, than I can safely say that this game has very well earned your money and time. You get an awesome game with even better story, graphics and sound which will set you back 40 hours of great gameplay.\n\n","August 20, 2014","true","39.6"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

While Ys tends to be more action and less story, this one is the polar opposite. While various elements of this game are reminiscent of the Tales series games, the storyline of this first chapter is incredibly detailed. It's the kind of storyline where you feel like the writers thought of everything. Any plot holes that may exist are minor but the conversation itself is intelligent, thoughtful, and thought provoking...while maintaining a good balance between the serious and the farcical.\n\nThe music has an interesting mix of jazz, classical, and folk elements and it all comes together quite nicely.\n\nAll that aside, the "Story Rich" tag is an understatement -- I don't think I've seen any RPG with the Story:Gameplay ratio of this game, even if you include Tales games' skits. (and Final Fantasy tends to drop the storyline around the third act -- this game does not) As a result, the gameplay is a bit simplistic and underdeveloped...but it's not hair pullingly difficult either. The AI in general seems extremely simple and easy to manipulate to score cheap victories in the tougher battles. If your dark secret is that you only play RPGs for the story, it's worth grabbing this title.","August 12, 2014","true","51.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This game is slow as heck off the start. the story isnt nearly as grand in scale as most games and its far slower paced then pretty much any RPG ive ever played. There is WAAAAAY more focus on story then combat. that said however the world is rich and full of life. NPCs are literally more intresting then full blown characters in other games out there. So many interconnected stories going on in the background the world building is astounding and the raw amount of text is totally insane if you dont like reading avoid this now. People change what they say after every tiny little story progression point and conections are facinating and a lot of fun to piece together from little everyday things to much grander things happening around you The world truely feels alive.\n\nIn terms of combat its a mix of SRPG into a Turn based game. I really enjoy the effects meter next to the turn order so you can actaully tell when for instance "a random critical hit" is gonna happen and you can break the turn order so you can steal that crit for your team which is intresting and the craft system combine with "EP (basically mana or SP in any other game). its not the best combat system out there but its different and its fun.\n\nthe actual main plot takes its sweet time building up. if you have low patence or a bad attention span i wouldnt bother. If you are the type of person who can invest into something you will get a crazy well written story out of it. the writting style is much slower but its very steady. This game wont always be throwing plot points at you but its building upon the overall plot and when the plot twist happen oh my god.\n\nIn terms of structure this game reminds me of the old SNES RPGs in terms of how it feels. take that design idea and push it foward i always found newer RPGs just dont have the magic that a lot of older SNES RPGs had but this took that feel to newer era of game design. Even the music it just has many tracks you can hum a long to as you walk down roads their memerable and sound amazing.\n\nWould I recemend it well if your intrested heck yeah. Its not a game for everyone but if this sounds like your cup of tea its bloody fantastic. and Xseed and Falcom are both awesome for making this happen and deserve the support Xseed is an awesome localization company that is true to their fans and you can talk to them on forums even and Falcom is a godlike game developer that just cares and does so many things right its crazy.","November 2, 2015","true","6.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

Amazing writing, world building, characters, and plot across the board with no real weak areas for any of it. Plain and simple, this is the sort of game that proves games are incredibly effective at telling stories.\n\nThe reason for my reservations on suggesting it is that the above is all the game has going for it. Gameplay is in many ways shallow. Never to the point of stupidity unless you're playing on a difficulty below Hard, but First Chapter in particular has so many simplistic fights and entire dungeon designs are almost as simple as Final Fantasy 13's layouts. Cast balance is also an issue in combat, with some being blatantly better than others to frankly shocking degrees.\n\nIf you want a game with a beautiful, engaging story that would make for a classic were it a book and is only enhanced by letting you explore and interact with a detailed world, this is your game. If you're looking for a game that has deep, engaging mechanics and play, you will not find it here.","December 16, 2015","true","46.1"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

It’s an entry in the recent trend of “jRPG/Console-style RPG” being ported to PCs, and it is a darn fine ambassador of the genre.  It does adhere to character archetypes and story tropes common to the genre, but even these familiar elements are so lovingly handled that they only serve to increase the quality of the game.  In fact, there’s this sense that a great deal of affection went into the game’s production.  For example, nearly every NPC no matter how incidental has a name, a believable place in the world, and frequently updating dialogue that progresses with and reacts to the evolving story.  It’s this attention to detail that makes Trails in the Sky feel like a living setting.\n\nThe game features a turn-based combat system that incorporates movement and positioning into the fights and places great weight on the initiative system.  These elements help make combat a more tactical affair than simply repeatedly selecting the “Attack” option until all the enemies fall down, though admittedly that is still a valid strategy at times.\n\nTrails in the Sky took me about 50 hours to play through at a leisurely clip.  The story is a bit slower paced, but intentionally so.  Appropriate time is spent developing and exploring characters and places, and even familiar and cliche concepts are made fresh (or at least fun) with the extra time spent getting to know them.\n\nThis is a game I have no hesitation recommending for both newcomers and fans of the genre.  Here’s looking forward with anticipation and excitement to the next one!","February 3, 2015","true","53.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

This JRPG has you follow brother and sister Estelle and Joshua as they embark on a grand adventure across the country of Liberl searching for their missing father while uncovering a secret conspiracy.\n\nThis game features rich world building and a great attention to detail. All of your party members have such unique and interesting personalities that you'll be nicely immersed in the character development also. Falcom JDK Band's soundtrack once again takes center stage with comfortable music that makes you feel like you're right next to Estelle and Joshua as they trek the roads of Liberl.\n\nCombat is pretty fun too. With magic needing one turn to channel in this game, turn advancement and turn stealing become main focuses during battle. Nothing is more satisfying than your AoE magic landing on a critical turn bonus and wiping the entire enemy horde. My favorite part of the game mechanic has to be the Orbment system. Each character has a combat watch called the Orbment that you can outfit Gems, called Quartz, with. You generate spells by placing Quartz in a line and racking up elemental counts. I just love fidding with the Orbment to see what type of spells I can generate by different placement of Quartz.\n\nThis game is all about being comfortable. With 100% escape rate against normal enemies, you are not required to fight every single foe you see (which is a plus too because this game does not have random encounter). You can skip most enemies if you like and get to the heartwarming slice of life main cutscenes. You can play the entire game with just a mouse too. Just relax and enjoy the story.\n\nTrails in the Sky is a solid JRPG with great world building, character development, and music. By the time you reach the ending you will beg for the heartwarming conclusion in Trails in the Sky Second Chapter with mind nukes, betrayals, happenings, and fateful confrontations along the way.","August 2, 2014","true","90.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"

You play as a pair of young adventures who set out across a vast continent to explore and help those in need.  Things slowly escalate into a story of friendship, love, betrayal, espionage with of course lots of monsters.  This is the first game of "The Legend of Heroes trilogy".  The other two are still being localized for English audiences (due out 2015/2016).  It’s taken a while to translate due to the incredibly vast amount of text in each game.  This is great if you love a good story, but you will have to be willing to read a lot, there is no voice acting to be found.  However if you stick with it you will be rewarded with a memorable yarn.\n\nGraphically the game is dated (2004) but still very enjoyable, very bright and vivid, and the lovely sound track really compliments the visuals.  Game play is a refined and polished turn based affair with attacks, magic, special moves and a fair sized casts of unique characters to try out in battle.  There is also a gem system that allows you to customize your characters magic as you see fit.  All foes are present on screen (no random battles) and you can save at any time (not just at check points).  Plenty of side quests to complete and special loot to find make “Legend of Heroes" very addicting for the JRPG crowd.  Overall "Trails in the Sky" is one of the crown jewels of the JRPG genre this century, a must play for JRPG fans and worth a play for anyone who likes to dabble in the genre on occasion, and it plays great with a gamepad.","June 27, 2015","true","60.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/subjectinfinite/recommended/251150/","subjectinfinite","Subject Infinite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/subjectinfinite/","288 products in account","The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the sky is perhaps the most complete, detailed, fully realised game worlds I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing in my 15+ years of PC gaming. It also gave me strong vibes of the first Studio Ghibli film, Castle in the sky (a movie I very much enjoyed).\n\nThe worldbuilding geek in me marvelled at the attention paid to the politics of the nations, the lore, character histories and motivations and the sheer epic scale of the adventure I undertook. The storytelling is truly excellent, with, different aspects of the story being developed in different parts and places. There'll be things that happen in the beginning of the game which are very much relevant to the endgame and they sort of surprise you when they crop back up again. I guess you could say there are layers to the storytelling.\n\nThe characters were another very strong aspect of Legend of Heroes. Each character has their own story and motivations, and as I did quests with the various characters, I found myself bonding with them too. The attention to detail really pleased me, one can go to random corners of cities and talk to random people in their houses and they'll have their bit to say, and the characters around them will also be involved in the dialogue too. They have no bearing on the main story at all - or even any of the side quests yet all these details are there. There isn't a character or NPC in the game that doesn't have a name or some dialogue for them to say.\n\nThe turn based combat is fun, and very strategic. How you equip your characters is very important in determining the dynamics of your battle and how your characters synergise (or otherwise) in battle. You can also organise the combat order, weapons and orbment powers.\n\nGraphically the game is OK, but seeing as the windows version was originally released in 2004, and this is an old school JRPG, there's really not a whole lot to expect in terms of fancy in game graphics. The rendered-scene art style is nice, however. Some of the dialogue can be a little weird at times, but I chalk that up to it being a Japanese game and there being a bit of a cultural divide, and possibly the case of some things simply not translating well.\n\nThe game works really well, with only one very minor glitch encountered in my playthrough of ~54hrs (and I didn't even finish all the bracer quests) - and it was easy to work around it. I played this using a dualshock 4 controller and had no issues accessing all the menus and playing the game seamlessly.\n\nThere is simply so much depth to this game in terms of combat mechanics, worldbuilding, lore and characters that I was as immersed in this game, nay moreso immersed, than I have been in most modern AAA 3D titles, despite the core game itself being over a decade old. The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the sky absolutely has my recommendation, particularly for fans of world-building, fantasy and good storytelling. Now someone please hurry up and translate chapter 2!\n\n\n","June 30, 2015","true","54.0"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Interesting skills and abilities. An absorbing, engaging plot. Characters you want to grow with.\n\nLegend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky has none of these things.\n\nInstead, you get tired, limited - and very slow - combat; a rather creepy romance sub-plot; lots and lots (and I really do mean lots) of text to read; a plot that really doesn't get going until very, very late in the game; horrible, twee and juvenile writing and padding. Lots of padding.\n\nThere is a charm to the graphics outside of combat, though.\n.\n.\n.\nTL;DRI didn't like this. At all. And I'm going to go into a lot of detail about why. I don't really expect anybody to read this, but hey, it's cathartic.\n\nIt's been a while since I've played a 'proper' JRPG and, sadly, having played this it's not only made me happily remove the Second Chapter from my wishlist, but put me off playing any other JRPGs for a while too. I mean, it's so bad it has compelled me to write my first review.\n\nBut everybody else loves it?\nYep, I'm going against the majority view here and, admittedly, I'm not an obsessive fan of JRPGs (though one of my favourites of all time in Shining Force 2 - unless we're saying that's a SRPG? In which case it's probably Lost Odyssey). But I love the RPG genre, turn-based in particular, and there aren't that many to choose from outside of RPG Maker attempts (though that is changing).\n\nSo what's wrong with it/you? (delete as appropriate)\nOkay, where to start? (That applies to either of the above statements)\n\nWell, for the first few hours I didn't mind it. Sure, there was a lot of talking to get through before seeing my first combat grid, but it was alright. I found the world to have a bit of charm and the orbment mechanic seemed to have potential.\n\nSo...?\nBut then...nothing happened. I expected the story would open out into something vaguely interesting (it didn't), the orbments to provide some real tactics in combat (they didn't), the characters to become appealing (...you can guess my comment here) - but no.\n\nWell that's nice and vague. What were your issues specifically?\nSpecifically, Estelle was incredibly irritating, Joshua was a smug so-and-so, Cassius was some superhero that everybody in the world seemed to know, Olivier and Scherazard were meant to provide some 'comedy' and failed etc - I basically hated them all. The script was awful too, constantly doing that thing we see in US TV where every part of the plot has to be insultingly explained for the viewer in great detail. It also did the whole 'I know something important but I'm not going to say anything yet because [reasons]' far too often, then followed that up post something happening with the 'Yes, that's what I thought would happen.'\n\nI gather that there are some callbacks in the next game to the world-building in place in here, but whether any of that is meaningful is debatable. I'm sure somebody can clarify.\n\nRegardless, there is a lot of dreadful dialogue to get through, with everybody seemingly never having spoken to people before and feeling the need to relate a life story whenever you get close. There are fairly frequent long-spells where all you are doing is wishing you could skip through the text quicker. I admit that I stopped reading completely during Chapter 3 because it was all too much - and that probably saved me another few hours playtime.\n\nThen there is the turn-based combat. At the start I thought the orbment idea had potential but it never played out, nor was stuff explained anywhere. The characters never felt they had defined roles - there was no real stand-out arts user (though some characters had much bigger EP pools, they didn't have considerably better art attacks) and melee was similar output for everybody too - they all felt pretty much the same.\n\nMixing orbments up didn't really do much to the tactical element either, something I put down to the fact that proper debuffs/status affects don't really exist; you'd never cast an art purely for the potential status affect (not with a massive 10% chance of success) so it became more just about pure damage-dealing.\n\nAnd - as noted above - everything happened so slowly (by this I mean the arts/movement/melee animations and AI turns etc). And last bit spoiler: it really grated that in the last dungeon melee on the doom machines was almost useless and you have to constantly use arts, those battles became long, tedious affairs that where I never felt in danger, but still had to waste time seeing the same poorly-animated spells going off again and again. Or maybe I was underleveled for this bit - I did every side mission bar 1 and only fought the chest monsters in the last area so was around level 38 when I finished, but given the Death Rage spam instantly killed any character it was cast on, I'm guessing the game expected me to grind a bit to make that fight (and the chest fights) a bit easier. Had I not beaten the boss on my first go I probably would have gone a-grinding for a bit.\n\nI actually started this on Christmas day 2014 - so it's taken a year to finish. I remember getting through the first 10-15 hours pretty quickly, but then got bogged-down and couldn't face playing it, so dipped in-and-out for an hour here and then over a number of months. It's only in the past 6 weeks or so that I made a concerted effort to complete it so I could remove it from my library; I couldn't abandon it because I'd already invested too long in it.\n\nSo was there anything you liked about it? Any chance you'll change your mind on getting Second Chapter?\nThere were some good things in it. The difficulty dropping if you lost the same fight too many times was good; it looked rather nice outside of the combat portion and it was pretty easy overall, with the odd spike here and there.\n\nBut there's nothing that would make me consider getting Second Chapter; I just had no interest in the overall story and certainly no love for the characters, so I wouldn't be interested in spending another 50+ hours with them. And from what I've seen, the next game is almost exactly the same in terms of the combat, which I didn't enjoy this time around. So no.\n\nWell thanks for that. You should have just stuck to saying "I thought this was rubbish!"\nTrue - but where's the fun in that?","December 29, 2015","false","59.0"," 119 of 229 people (52%) found this review helpful 26 people found this review funny","52","119","229","26","5"

If you want the TL;DR, it's that you should get the game and play through it if you like JRPGs. It's the first game in a trilogy, so be aware that the story is not complete with this game.\n\nThis is a JRPG about growing up and finding your own wings while living in your parent's shadow. It also has saving the region as a secondary characteristic, but there you go.\n\nThe game was confusing to get used to for the first several hours, but it's pretty intuitive and well-designed once you have a grasp of what means what and how things work together.\n\nThe battle system isn't revolutionary or anything, but some strategy is still necessary for a lot of fights. The magic system isn't a new concept to me, but the way it's presented is unique enough to be a neat idea. It's an interesting way of allowing every character to use magic, but it really differentiates who is a strong magic-user and who is probably better just sticking to basic attacks and skills.\n\nThe story does its job and the characters are interesting enough. I can't think of anything off-hand that feels out of place, although there are a few segments that don't feel all that necessary. The pacing of characterization is in a good place, especially for the two protagonists.\n\nThe character balance in-game felt a bit wonky, though. I have only played on Normal difficulty, so take this with a grain of salt, but I've noticed that magic-heavy people are incredibly strong in the end-game and more physical-based people are much less strong. This basically makes Estelle+Joshua+Kloe+Olivier the best endgame line-up by default, since Kloe and Olivier are the two mages of the group. I also felt that Tita felt pretty much worthless past the first couple of quests that you have her in. Her AoE blind was fantastic when I first used it, but her stats are below average and she blows up when she's sneezed at, so there's not much you can do with her.\n\nThe second game hasn't come out on steam yet when I'm writing this review, so I can't really comment on the ending at this point. The plot twist, while being foreshadowed throughout the entire story, still came out of left field and shocked me. It makes sense on a surface level for it to be possible, but the fact that it ended on a huge cliffhanger makes it difficult to take it seriously until I see it come up again in the second game. The verdict's out on that one.\n\nAll in all, this is a solid game that will give any JRPG fan a good time.\n\nAlso, did I mention that this game has secrets out the ♥♥♥? Because it does.","January 22, 2015","true","73.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

So they can bring more over! anyway onto the review!\n\nIm going to start of with saying that if you dont like reading this game is not for you, there is a crap ton of reading involved.  That being said though it is extremely good writing and well worth your time.\n\nCharacters:  There are the 2 main characters Estelle and Joshua Bright,  they are highly entertaining and good interactions with each other and the world.  Estelle is a dive in head first type of girl but not to the point of annoyance and Joshua in calm, collective and analytical.  You have there mentor Schezzard (I think thats how you spell it) who is nick-named the Silver streak, highly regarded in the guild but has a drinking problem.  There is the confident romantic who thinks hes smooth but is just cheesy and a bunch of other characters that are all very well developed and likable.  Due to the perfect amount of character development these people are a delight to watch and interact with.\nI give them an 8/10 points are deducted because lack of originality (the same type of chars can be found all over the place many not as well done though)\n\nStory:  Ah the story is a masterpeice IMO, it is a little slow paced but thats how I like it, but its not because of it originality but because of how its told.  You can read the latest issue of the news to learn about current events, you can speak with NPC's to learn more about history and day to day problems in thier lives.  There are also conspiracies and political mumbo jumbo. After every major plot point the NPC dialogue changes Now I havent said anything about the actual story because I beleive you should experience for yourselfs.  9/10 I deducted a point for reasons I shall later explain.\n\nGameplay:  Gameplay is.. ok, its fun but nothing new and is pretty easy for any vertran JRPG players.  I would recermend this to new people of the genre as a good starting point.  To start with you have an overworld which has a minimap, monsters and points of interest (chests and quest items mostly).  The minimap is pretty straightforward if shows shops, inns, entrance/exits and other good stuff.  Monsters can be engaged by touching them and you can find chests around the place, Pro-tip always check chests a second time.\nCombat is held after engaging a monster and transitioning to a battlefield, there are tiles in which you navagate to hit enemys and so on.  You have several type of moves you can use, a basic attack,  art which is essentially magic and S-craft.  All are usefull and essential to the game, for more info on these please read the wiki.  The combat overall is fun but nothing groundbreaking.  7/10 for gameplay because its not what makes me want to play the game but it doesnt dicourage me from playing.\n\nOverall I give this game a 8/10, it fun, has a very entertaining plot and the chests... the frigen chests make me smile :)\n\nSorry for all spelling mistakes I have never been good at it and thankyou for reading my review (my first review :D)","August 12, 2014","true","48.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

First it has a rock solid story which gets more and more interesting as you advance. Side quest are pretty interesting and you'll not feel like the town lackey for once, investigation, some monster slaying it all feels pretty natural and you can miss most of them if you try to steamroll through the main story. Characters design  while a tad stereotypical ( read classic shounen manga ) works really well and you'll quickly grow fond of them.\n\nWhat I don't like is the combat system, while it has some interesting sides ( scraft and quartz for example ) the fact that you cannot move and act in the same turn is a serious flaw in my opinion. Perhaps because I played too much FFT or Tactics Ogre back in the days. And the biggest flaw of this game is that the sequel is not out yet! So I'll just mess around and wait for the second chapter release before finishing this one or perhaps learn japanese...\n\nTo conclude I think that the game is really worth the money for any rpg fan more into powerful story than into groundbreaking combat system.","November 8, 2014","true","45.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/understoodenigma/recommended/251150/","understoodenigma","UnderstoodEnigma","http://steamcommunity.com/id/understoodenigma/","61 products in account","I've heard this game called a masterpiece, but when I look at it compared to what I consider to be masterpieces of the fantasy RPG genre, I don't know if I would put it on that level.\n\nThat being said, this is a very very good game. I will review this game in three parts: The battle system, the story, and the upgrade system.\n\nThe battle system:\nIn this game, battles seemed to take a backseat to the story. The battle system was not boring, and having a variety of characters with different fighting styles throughout the story kept it fresh, but it didn't really have any outstanding features. There was a sort of battle chain that determined the order of when characters or enemies would attack, which could be interrupted in certain cases by the player or enemies using special abilities. Not exceptional, but not boring by any means. The only times I found myself avoiding battles was when the experience received wasn't worth it.\n7/10\n\nThe story:\nThough maybe a little cliche, the story was engaging and interesting. Set in a world on the tail end of recovering from a large war, you play as the daughter and adopted son of a "bracer" which is a sort of mercenary policeman. You travel across the whole country you live in as you train to be a full-fledged bracer yourself, meeting many characters and developing the story as you go. The plot is riddled with twists and turns, but thankfully no unecessary-feeling backtracking. The side quests don't add to the story, but they do add to your experience and make you feel like you're doing bracer work. I hate to say it, but I called the major plot twist at the beginning of the game, though it didng take away from the overall story.\n8/10\n\nThe upgrade system:\nUpgrades took two forms in this game: orbments and equipment. I felt like this was the most lacking portion of the game, and it almost felt like it was added as an afterthought. The equipment system is actually boring. There is no upgrading equipment, you can only find new equipment in dungeons and chests, as well as buying weapons and armor. By the end of the game, I had way too much money and nothing to spend it on, becasue the equipment stopped getting better in what felt like far before the end of the game. Every character uses a different class of weapon, so you really have no reason to save multiples of each weapon and prioritize on which characters get the best weapons.\nOn to orbments.\nI wished that this had been a better executed part of the game. At the beginning, it seemed like it was going to be very important, but I felt like it was only really important for one character at a time. Orbment is essentially the magic or spells of the game. You give characters abilities by equipping them with certain orbments. You can also use these orbments to bolster stats at the same time. The one character where orbments would feel important was whoever I was using as my designated healer. It was confusing to use, and never really explained well, though once you get deeper in the game, you can figure it out pretty well, and the game gives you resources of which magic you can get with certain combinations of orbments.\n5/10\n\nOverall, this is a good game, worth a play. The characters are lovable and the world is engaging. My average of these parts gives this game a 6.6/10, but I would definitely say I enjoyed the overall product enough to make it an even 7/10.","March 7","true","51.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I'm a huge J-RPG fan, it's my favorite genre by far, but, as in every category, J-RPGs can be vastly different one from another.\n\nThis is an "old-school" J-RPG, where the emphasis is put on the characters and the story, with a servicable battle system (that gets more interesting in higher difficulties, but not the main focus), and I must say, it might rely here and there on well-known "tropes", but the quality of writing and the way things are told is nothing short of perfect.\n\nSo, if you like J-RPGs for their memorable stories and characters, hop aboard! Trails in the Sky takes its time, it's a slow start, but for all the building that is presented through the game, there is always a pay-off, and a great one.\n\nDO NOTE that this game ends on a cliffhanger, and that its sequel, Trails in the Sky Second Chapter, begins right after this one finishes. In more than one way, they are one really big game divided in two for development reasons (and not for some cash-grab). That being said, it has become one of my favorite J-RPG of all times, along titles like Suikoden 2, Final Fantasy 6 and the likes.","December 30, 2015","true","121.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Nothing too major, just a trope/cliche that I'm not particularly fond of, and one that I think is overdone/done poorly a lot.  Still, considering this is just part of a series, I'm not too bothered by it; if this game is any indication, the rest of the series will more than make up for it.\n\nNothing that you haven't seen before (not surprising considering it's age) but I don't think it's much of an exageration to call this a masterpiece.  Everything seems to be gracefully woven together, with attention to detail where it matters.  The characters are likeable, if a bit generic in some instances, but they play together nicely.  The world building is fantastic, each NPC having several different bits of dialogue depending on where you are in the main story.  Lots of locales, lots of friends.  Even bits that would be jarring on their own are supported so well by the rest of the game that it makes sense.\n\nPlus, it does one of my absolute favorite things a video game can do, ever!  I don't understand why developers can't figure out that the climax is so much more interesting if it draws from all your actions leading up to that point.  It's honestly rare, and probably worth playing for that reason alone.\n\n(On that note, if anyone is interested in getting into game development, definitely give this one a study.  The execution is mostly flawless, even if not all of the pieces are perfect.)\n\n9.9 out of 10, lmao","February 14","true","47.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I felt invested in the story from the start, something that many games try to accomplish, but fail.  I discovered a cast of eight like able and relatable main characters, along with a good many well-done supporting characters, expansive towns that were filled with NPCs that had unique and diverse dialogues, and a game that takes well over 50 hours to beat.  The soundtrack is amazing:  I did not hear a single track during the game that I did not like or that I did not think was appropriate for the circumstances.  The humor is well done, and dispersed widely enough that I did not feel that it was coming too quickly, but I was still left with a smile on my face for most of the game.  The graphics are a little dated, but since I prefer a compelling story over good graphics, I was able to overlook that, and despite the fact that they are dated, they still look really good.  The combat runs smoothly, without dragging on like it is liable to do in some games.  All in all, I would highly recommend this game to any fan of the JRPGS genre, and I know that I will definitely return to this game for many years.","August 24, 2014","true","49.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

A fantastic experience, i did not sleep for 3 days just to play this game. My reason? the fantastic story.\nIt started of with seemingly cliche story, but oh my god.. the dialogue between the characters are just simply marvelous. Each characters have their own screentime and development, even the NPC.  I was biting my fingers in frustration when i found out the story is to be continued in second chapter. I have been waiting the sequel for 4 years now.\n\nWhen i found out there are the PC port of the game on STEAM (2014), i showed my support and purchased the digital copy. And the same thing happened [to my surprise], i did not sleep for 3 days again just to play through this game. And same thing happened at the end of the game, I am biting my fingers in frustration and anxiety , waiting for the sequel.\n\nthe gameplay of the game itself was rather simple, battle is simple turn-based mechanics with ability yo intercept/cancel enemy movement [almost similar to Grandia series]. It is simple but proved to be challenging at times.\n\nthere are tonnes of sidequest, which are rather tedious at a glance, like killing certain enemies, collecting certain items, etc. But the result is so rewarding, not because of the items, but because it affect THE PLOT itself! [well mostly the NPC], but the dialogue of the NPC in the sequel will change depending whether you completed certain sidequests, or your rank at the end of the game.\n\nThis game is a simply must buy, for a 20 dollar purchase, it is a very worth purchase.\n\nNow i am awaiting the sequel and swore to purchase it on the day it is released [and perhaps take another 3 days of all-nighter]","February 11, 2015","true","50.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Nothing too major, just a trope/cliche that I'm not particularly fond of, and one that I think is overdone/done poorly a lot.  Still, considering this is just part of a series, I'm not too bothered by it; if this game is any indication, the rest of the series will more than make up for it.\n\nNothing that you haven't seen before (not surprising considering it's age) but I don't think it's much of an exageration to call this a masterpiece.  Everything seems to be gracefully woven together, with attention to detail where it matters.  The characters are likeable, if a bit generic in some instances, but they play together nicely.  The world building is fantastic, each NPC having several different bits of dialogue depending on where you are in the main story.  Lots of locales, lots of friends.  Even bits that would be jarring on their own are supported so well by the rest of the game that it makes sense.\n\nPlus, it does one of my absolute favorite things a video game can do, ever!  I don't understand why developers can't figure out that the climax is so much more interesting if it draws from all your actions leading up to that point.  It's honestly rare, and probably worth playing for that reason alone.\n\n(On that note, if anyone is interested in getting into game development, definitely give this one a study.

I'm a huge J-RPG fan, it's my favorite genre by far, but, as in every category, J-RPGs can be vastly different one from another.\n\nThis is an "old-school" J-RPG, where the emphasis is put on the characters and the story, with a servicable battle system (that gets more interesting in higher difficulties, but not the main focus), and I must say, it might rely here and there on well-known "tropes", but the quality of writing and the way things are told is nothing short of perfect.\n\nSo, if you like J-RPGs for their memorable stories and characters, hop aboard! Trails in the Sky takes its time, it's a slow start, but for all the building that is presented through the game, there is always a pay-off, and a great one.\n\nDO NOTE that this game ends on a cliffhanger, and that its sequel, Trails in the Sky Second Chapter, begins right after this one finishes. In more than one way, they are one really big game divided in two for development reasons (and not for some cash-grab).

I haven't played many JRPGs before this so I can't really compare, but this one is definitely my favorite one. Well story-wise anyway.\n\nThe story was really enjoyable and it really seemed like they'd put a lot of effort into building the world the game took place in. The characters were memorable, some more than others (Olivier my hero!) and I felt like I actually cared about what was happening to them. After the game was over, I had a feeling similar to finishing a good book: I was a bit sad because it ended.\n\nI can't say the combat system was the best one I've seen. It got the job done decently and I did have fun, but sometimes I felt like the game wasn't giving me enough info about what was going on. For example: it seemed as if some characters did more damage to certain monster types, but nowhere did it tell the type of the attack move when attacking, which meant I had to determine the logic myself for every character and every move everytime I encountered a new monster. Some might argue it's not necessarily a bad thing and adds to the "cut-throat nature of the game", but I didn't like it.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed the game. Took me about 55 hours to get through the whole story, but I did spend a lot of time just talking to all the NPC's after every tiny event that happened in the game, which resulted in a lot of unncesessary game time. This game was the first part of a story that spans over a trilogy. I'm now eagerly waiting for the possible Steam version of the second part.\n\nTL;DR\nLoved the story, gameplay is enjoyable, eagerly waiting for the sequel to be released on Steam.\n\n\n8/10","January 3, 2015","true","52.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/keeltoll/recommended/251150/","keeltoll","Worse","http://steamcommunity.com/id/keeltoll/","53 products in account","About a year and a half ago I posted my recommendation to this game only about three hours in, in that this game's acronym was a synonym for jiggly bits and that would never cease to amuse me. I've decided to revise my review upon completion even though I received some glorious upvotes. I can at least suggest this review is now fair.\n\nThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is about as JRPG as it can get, I've begrudgingly realized, but this should not detract from its face value even though the identifiable artstyle and everybody's-likable characterization gradually begin to sink in throughout its uncommonly extensive playtime. Gamers these days seem to either love or hate this sort of presentation, and I fell somewhere in the middle and allowed the mechanics to decide my money's worth instead. What I began to see was a world beyond my expectation.\n\nYour introduction to this bustling universe begins in the tale of two junior mercenaries. The game treats the player as one that understands the basics of turn-based combat and leveling, but as the guidance falls away for the characters, so too you begin to unknowningly master the system. There's magic to mess with that strengthens depending on how you configure it for each unique character. Weapons and armor get stronger with each new town visited, monsters get attacked based on their elemental weaknesses, and ingredients can get cooked into meals. Looking back at it now, it never really complicates or grows tiresome - it sort of becomes an invisible reflex as the plot takes center stage and finally hooks you. Even though I stopped playing for a few months off and on, its mechanics are simple enough to pick up again, and I hardly forgot what's going on in the story either. It leaves that solid of an impression. It lingers and encourages you to keep going.\n\nI'm not normally someone compelled to 100% a game, but I found myself willing to try (and I couldn't, because even though I tried to take my time and explore the hundreds of areas and talk to the hundreds of NPCs [each with an agenda and lifestyle of their own!], I still missed several sidequests and extra details that strangely nag me that I didn't use a guide and discover it all). I can't begin to understand what told me to want to be a completionist for this game. It could be that I couldn't survive the enemies without trying to feel safe with as much gear as possible, or it might lie with the reason that I came to respect the depth and narrative power put in place and it was gratifying to experience it all.\n\nIt's impressive that it generates its own interpretation of politics, war, and industry for its fictional country. As the characters get wrapped in it, interactions and events begin to overlap and expand, and it ends up speaking volumes about how the game is full to the brim with details that are lovingly planned. In its final act, the sequel was practically sold to me with the multiple questions left unsolved. How a game can accomplish this makes me forget the fact that it slipped my mind I was skeptically playing a JRPG in the first place.\n\nLet TLoH: ♥♥♥♥ fulfill your wishes or invalidate your biases depending on which side of the fence you sit on for the genre, for I can faithfully say you will be pleasantly surprised.","February 9","true","58.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The story begins on the eve of the Queen’s birthday celebration, 10 years after the kingdom’s last big war.  When I started the game, I actually thought this setting didn’t sound particularly interesting (airships remind me of the SNES Final Fantasy), but the story soon sucked me in.  Trails in the Sky is a big game, over the course of which you have a wide world to explore.  And yet each town and location has its own distinct flavor: it never feels like “oh here’s another stop off point with an inn and a weapon shop.  The history and backstory revealed over the course of the game is also more interesting than I thought it would be.\n\nSTORY: It’s also a long game (and this is just Part I), but—once things really get started—you’re pushed on by a compelling narrative.  In the main story, there’s never any backtracking, padding or enforced level grinding; it’s more like you finish one big mission only to be confronted with a new emergency.  The story contains some great twists and defied my genre-based expectations.  For example, you might think you’d be chasing down those Sky Bandits you hear about throughout the whole game, but by the end of the first chapter you’ve moved on to face new intrigue.  You’re also arrested at some point, and I thought “Oh, here comes the part where you need to break out of prison” but things resolve themselves differently.\n\nCHARACTERS: The setting and plot are great, but the key to a good story is always the characters.  And Trails in the Sky is populated with a memorable cast of characters.  There are the heroes: at the start of the game Estelle is sort of a headstrong tomboy and Joshua, her adopted brother whose past (before their father took him in) is a mystery, takes things more seriously and is a bit of a goody-two-shoes.  Some of the best parts in the game are the “down time” moments where we see Estelle and Joshua grow as characters, learn about their family’s history and watch their relationship evolve.  There are also plenty of memorable secondary characters; even many who play only a minor role are given a distinct personality.  Some may be a little cartoonish (playing Trails in the Sky is a bit like being in the middle of a good anime), others start out seeming like caricatures but later reveal more depth.\n\nCOMBAT AND GAMEPLAY: The combat system is mostly what you’d expect in a JRPG.  There are a few elements that stuck out for me, such as the fact that players and opponents (basically) occupy places on a grid and you sometimes need to factor in distance and how far you can move in a turn.  You can also strategically plan your actions to make the most of bonuses that are tied to specific turns.  The biggest element is the use of battle quartzes that you either find or have crafted: these determine which arts (magic spells, basically) each character will have in her arsenal as well as giving bonuses.  You have only a limited number of slots so you have to make choices, and the ways you’ll use each character in combat will differ a lot based on which quartz you give them.  Another element that stood out for me are the Recipes: instead of just buying heal potions, you can learn a number of different recipes and (combining items you get from killing monsters with ingredients you buy from the general store) you can make various food items that each restore a certain amount of health, cure different abnormal conditions (e.g. being poisoned) and may even give you some sort of boost.  I spent a lot of time learning recipes and cooking things.\n\nGRAPHICS, SOUND, MUSIC: Basically, on the high end of what you’d expect from a JRPG.  For the most part nothing to write home about, but every so often there'll be a visual sequence that stands out (e.g. looking out over the waterfalls or exploring the royal castle).\n\nTRANSLATION AND LOCALIZATION: Excellent.  Almost without exception, the English dialogue sounds totally natural.  If I were to nitpick, there are a couple of places where I think culturally specific elements could have been dealt with a bit better (mostly the flamboyant character getting called a pervert—but, eh, he is sort of a pervert).\n\nCRITICISM\nPACING/SIDE QUESTS: Having said all that, the game can be slow in parts if you try to complete all the optional side quests and find all the chests containing special items.  These are optional, but doing these jobs is part of your duties as a Bracer.  Some are interesting, but later on many seem repetitive.  Some also have a, not entirely transparent, time limit for completion.  Because of this I seemed to fail one in each town (there are also hidden side quests).  The time limit can be particularly frustrating as—main story wise—you are simultaneously being told, “We need to get to X right away.”  In other words, unless you ignore the false sense of urgency you can miss the deadline to complete some jobs.\n\nQUARTZ/ARTS SYSTEM: Figuring out which quartz you need and which order to put them in in order to get specific arts is complicated and I never really got the hang of it.\n\nNON-LETHAL K.O.: The game specifies that when HP reaches 0 you’re only K.O.’d and not actually dead (which, thank goodness, because I’ve had to revive characters a number of times), but Trails in the Sky does have some of those frustrating moments of “ludonarrative dissonance” where you defeat some important opponents (all of them are K.O.’d) only to have them escape out the window to fight another day or (even more egregious) refuse to cooperate and act like they can still take you on again(!).  Yes, this is a convention of the genre and in MOST cases it’s justified in service of the story, but it’s a pet peeve of mine.\n\nCONCLUSION: Those are the only things I can find to criticize and they’re minor points.  In general, this game is great fun.  I see myself replaying it sooner or later in order to find all the secrets I missed out on the first time around.  Especially if you find this on sale, don’t hesitate to snag it!  If you like JRPG at all you will not regret the purchase!","April 17","true","93.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While combat isn't necessarily quite on par with the two games I've mentioned, it certainly takes steps into innovation. While there are still turns, you play on a grid with the ability to move your characters around. Although this doesn't seem like much, there are abilities and magic that requires positioning. Sometimes a character's ability will require them to walk to specific areas of the battle map, and sometimes the characters will find themselves out of range for attacking. It's a unique addition along with the dynamic turn system which decides who moves first, second, or last, mixing up battles and making them unique.\n\nThe second innovation involves "Orbaments" in which the characters all use a mineral called "Quartz" in order to obtain certain and unique spells. The Orbament system allows you to specifically create your character for a certain role, as the Quartz combinations not only get you spells, but also certain stat buffs. How the system works sounds simple but it can be incredibly hard to 'build' a character accordingly. The Orbament system acts a bit like a minipuzzle, with each Quartz having different properties of certain elements (water, earth, wind, fire, space, time etc.). Not only do you require a certain combination for certain spells, but each character can also have 1-5 different 'lines.' This pretty much separates how your elements 'stack' and you have to think about where you place your quartz. A very cool way to implement a customization system, and it allows each and every character to adapt to specific situations (however some party members will have a unique 'slot' that only allows a specific element of quartz).\n\nWhile many might complain about 'grinding' I found out that you actually don't have to grind that much at all. As long as you don't sell your Sepith, you can get the higher tier quartz, and open up slots for all your characters. The reality is, you don't necessarily need the slots but if you want them then you'll have to search out specific monsters to grab them. Once you do the quests and explore the surrounding areas, the game doesn't become too 'grindy' or hard. But if you want to make it harder on yourself, you can completely ignore the Orbament system, and areas.\n\nAs for the story, Trails in the Sky gets quite detailed. Some say that the plot doesn't pick up until chapter 3, but I found chapter 1 and 2 to be equally great. The only downside to Trails in the Sky is the fact that it is possibly "too detailed." For some players, they might not find reading text bubbles to be all that engaging, and in fact I found myself trying to skip the dialogue at some points. The game does drag itself, but it is a fairly minor issue.\n\nThe next downside of this game is that... even though it has "Trails in the Sky" you don't actually use an airship. I was hoping more or less, that our crew would end up on an airship going around different towns and places. However, it becomes a bit misleading, and I was disappointed.","October 15, 2015","true","57.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Great graphics (after you run the config program to bump it up from defaults) and writing.\n\nThere's a lot I found surprisingly great about this.  First of all, the story is fairly mature.  You control some teens who may be somewhat naive, but the words and behaviour of the adults shows that the protagonists' naive view of the world is only one part of the story, with darker themes hinted at.  Major characters have anime-style portraits which convey their feelings more powerfully and add a lot of nuance to interactions that the older games don't have.  And the wold-building is unbelievable.  Practically every interactable NPC has their own unique name and dialogue and not only that, but that dialogue changes based on which plot points you've hit.  Even if it's only something as simple as running minor errands and picking up your next chores.\n\nCombat also pretty cleverly side-steps the turn-based problem of it turning into a chore, by adding a bunch of little variables that keep you engaged to optimize your results.\n\nThis is a fantastic game and I STRONGLY recommend it.","August 15, 2014","true","17.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

A well delivered story with interesting characters, each with unique personalities that will put a smile on your face. A combat system that isin't too complex but provides a good amount of difficulty that scales nicely throughout the game as well as some level of strategy involved. The music is also very good and compliments the world/situation/fights quite nicely. Lastly, the lore of the world is very nice to look through if you are a lore lover and the side/hidden quests will always give you something to do.\n\nI will add though as since it is everything you could ask for this also means their is alot of chat and dialogue to go through but while this can be a nuisance to some people it helps provide gaps throughout the fighting and keeps the story flowing smoothly. I will also say that for a JRPG it isin't as long as you would think, however i believe that it doesn't drag on too much but wasen't short to the point that i was expecting more than what i got.\n\nIf you are looking for an old-school JRPG that is fun, compelling and is just fun to play through then this game should be right up your alley.","August 29, 2014","true","44.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Each and every one of them is unique, interesting, has his/her back story, desires, ambitions and distinct speech pattern (there are no VA for dialogs and I was very surprised that around middle of the game I began to almost literally hear character voices in my head, hear how they could've say this or that thing; it's an amazing achievement on itself since most of characters in now-a-days games are very um... forgettable)\n+ Overall world created with love and attention to details! I mean you can actually see story arcs of all NPCs around you! Even what seems to be some meaningless guard can has a mind blowing stuff to tell!\n+ Combat is perfectly balanced! Unlike most of JRPGs (especially very popular old-school series) in here you see enemies on a map! Meaning you don't have to fight same bunch of monsters every 3 steps you make (I'm looking at you SMT...) meaning developers do care about your time which you can spend on something more interesting (like reading one of great in-game books, or read in-game newspaper or just talk to NPC guys in a town)\n+ Very bright and colorful anime style graphics!

A hidden gem of retro RPGs. Easily worth $50.00, let alone $20.00. In my opinion, the trailors and the steam page don't do it justice; its a game you have to experience first-hand to truely understand its genius. This game has a large amount of detail and sidequests involving all the NPCs-- all of which I foolishly skipped on my first playthrough because I was that engrossed in the game's main storyline. Even if you do rush the main story, you're still looking at about 40 hours of gametime on a first run through the game. Then there is the New Game+ with harder difficulties to tackle, not to mention the undying impulse to go back and view the story a second time to try to catch-on to all those subtle plot points you missed or didn't understand the first time.\n\nAs for criticisms, I will say that the game does start off rather slow in the Prologue. Be patient! Once you are finished with the first couple of missions and get the hang of things the real story will start to take off. It doesn't take that long at all but I do realize that the first hour of a game makes a strong impression on a lot of gamers so I don't want people to be discouraged! Its no where near the level of Kingdom Hearts 2's boring five-hour tutorial sequence.\n\nBuy the game and if you love it, tell your friends!

I'd never really heard of this game until it popped up on Steam but given how few JRPG's end up here I snapped up straight away and I'm really glad I did. The games story is a slow burn, starting small and spending a good long time building the world and developing the characters. The main protagonists are junior Braces, a sort of cop for hire, and the game tracks their progress towards becoming fully fledged members. You'll start small, bounty hunting monsters, recovering lost items and conducting investigations. Eventually though you'll be swept up in a major conspiracy that will have you playing a key part in the events of your nation. The game world is detailed and well realised with a real weight of history. The characters are charming and likeable and each gets plenty of screen time to develop so that you actually come to genuinely care about them. The combat sytem is solid, nothing revolutionary but enough meat so you wont get bored with it. Enemies are visible on the main screen so you can avoid them if you wish or sneak up behind for some bonuses in combat. The graphics are dated, but its a ten year old game, that said the game still looks good at high resolutions with bright colours and a nice anime style, I found they had really grown on me by the end of the game, despite the low polygon count. I really can't recommend this highly enough, if you like JRPG's you owe it to yourself to buy this game.\n\nPros:\n+ Well detailed world with believable politics and history\n+ Very strong narrative\n+ Likeable characters\n+ Some humorous dialogue\n+ Slow burn, starts small, finishes big\n+ Good soundrack\n\n+/- There is a lot of reading in this.

I honestly have only good things to say about this game.\n\nThe story and the characters are definitely the best part of the game. It's a story about a girl named Estelle and her adopted brother Joshua. It tells of their journey, across the country of Liberl, as they train to be Bracers, defenders of justice and peace. On their adventures they get caught up in something so enormous that it puts the entire country of Liberl in danger. The story is very well paced and written. There are plenty of plot twists and surprises in store for you when you play the game. The writers definitely deserve an award for how well executed the story was.\n\nAll the characters presented in the game were very well rounded and thought out. None of the characters felt particularly flat through the game. You also get a feel and story of all of your companions that accompany them along their quest. Even side characters are fleshed out. There are no flat characters in this game. The best part of the game is seeing how Estelle and Joshua mature over the course of the game. Again, the writers definitely outdid themselves.\n\nThe game also had plenty of content to entertain you for what will feel like forever. The story, along with all the side quests and dungeons, took me nearly 45 hours to do. If you're looking for a long, thorough RPG experience, you've struck gold. None of the side quests felt particularly boring or repetitive and definitely fleshed out the game.\n\nThe combat in this game was very enjoyable as well. The combat system takes place on a grid with player characters and enemies occupying squares on that grid. The combat is turned based, but is not static (i.e Character 1 attacks, Enemy 1 attacks, Character 1 attacks, etc.). The combat is based on speed of the entity and their action. If you're fighting a particularly fast enemy, they may be able to attack thrice before you are able to retaliate.\n\nSome turns also offer bonuses such as guaranteed criticals and healing. These bonuses also work in favor of your enemy so it helps to plan out your moves to make sure you get the bonuses and not your enemies. There are a few more mechanics but it would simply take to long to explain. With that being said, the combat system is not complicated. I just don't want to type 3 paragraphs about the combat. Simply put, the combat is simple, effective, and fun.\n\nThe only thing I can see about the game is that may put people off is the graphics. The game was released in 2004 so it definitely has some age to it as far as video games go. I personally enjoyed the graphics as it gave the game a nice atmosphere to it. You're fine as long as you don't come into it thinking the graphics will be comparable to today's standards.\n\nIn the end, this game was absolutely amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. The story and characters, compelling. The content, enormous. The combat, fun. I honestly couldn't ask for anything more. Can't wait for the sequel.\n\n10/10\n\n(11/10 with rice)\n\nPS: The music in the game is also pretty darn good!","March 2, 2015","true","56.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Each and every one of them is unique, interesting, has his/her back story, desires, ambitions and distinct speech pattern (there are no VA for dialogs and I was very surprised that around middle of the game I began to almost literally hear character voices in my head, hear how they could've say this or that thing; it's an amazing achievement on itself since most of characters in now-a-days games are very um... forgettable)\n+ Overall world created with love and attention to details! I mean you can actually see story arcs of all NPCs around you! Even what seems to be some meaningless guard can has a mind blowing stuff to tell!\n+ Combat is perfectly balanced! Unlike most of JRPGs (especially very popular old-school series) in here you see enemies on a map! Meaning you don't have to fight same bunch of monsters every 3 steps you make (I'm looking at you SMT...) meaning developers do care about your time which you can spend on something more interesting (like reading one of great in-game books, or read in-game newspaper or just talk to NPC guys in a town)\n+ Very bright and colorful anime style graphics! I'm sorry, but for me that's a major plus. Aren't we all tired of same old greay-brown pallete in almost... like every game?\n+ Music... oh holy Yuno and Revy... this music is amazing! This is one of very rare ocasion when I want to listen to music separatley and after this review first thing I'll do is to check whether it's somewhere in the game's directory...\n+ Overall game flow.

You play as Estelle Bright, a 16year old girl whose father is a famous war hero and warrior, who as a character some people like, some people dislike, due to her personality being mostly her being confused about everything, asking questions and yelling, but is a good character is her own right, and i liked her as a character. Your main party member, who leaves you party once in the entire game, is your adopted brother Joshua, a calm and collected boy with a misterious past Estells age who was adopted by Estelels father after he was found in the forest one night.  There are other characters, a perverted bard called Olivier, a giant easterner called Zane, a bad-boy guy with a massive sword called Agate, a school girl(not what is sounds like) called Khloe, a little girl with a cannon(!) called Tita, and a female warrior called Schera. These are your main party members and will be with your party in some order or another throughout the game. Most of the games charm comes from the interactions the characters have between each other and the conversations. The game has amazing writing also, some of the best i have every seen. The gameplay for the game is best described as a combination of Final Fantasy esque turnbased combat, hexbased, with each cahracters "special" and "arts" like the Materia system in Final Fantasy VII. The gameplay is not the games strongest point, but i myself enjoyed it. The games story, while complicated, is best descrped as Estelle and Joshua travelling their country of Liberl, and discovering their true strenght and powers in the process. This brings me to a major gripe one would have with the game, the games cutscenes can sometimes last for over twenty minuetes of pure talking. While annoying, the writing is so superb that its at least servicable. The other major gripe is the last boss and ending, the last "boss" is more a boss rush, with the boss having a "one hit kill" attack, which is pretty annoying. The ending, and the events before it, is a MASSIVE cliffhanger that really comes out of no-where, and while it sets up the next game well, is pretty annoying. The ending and events before it really changes up the tone of the game, since it reveales a lot about Joshua and another character who was prevalent in the game, without spoiling the ending to much. Personally, i loved the game and think its one of the best games in the JRPG genre, but(!) its understandable that some people wouldn't like the combat and the long cut-scenes, and the entire Anime feeling the game has. The game is very Japanese if you catch my drift, a lot of things that are prevalent in Anime and Japanese Games, including character types, are prevalent in the game. All-in-all, i personally loved the game(as i said)and highly recommend the game.\nSorry, have to stop writing the review, have to talk in the forums about when the next game is coming out, Have a Nice Day and Happy Gaming!","February 17, 2015","true","40.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","3","4","3","0"

Bracers are akin to a private military or mercenaries, who accept any jobs ranging from mowing law to espionage. What starts as a light-hearted and easy going gig turns into a huge ordeal when Estelle and Joshua become embroiled in a series of events that threaten to change the shape of the peaceful kingdom of Liberl forever.\n\nOriginally released in Japan on PC back in 2004 as "Sora no Kiseki: FC," the series has become somewhat infamous for the absolute sheer size of its text, overshadowing those of even the most well known and story focused Japanese RPGs out there. The "FC" stood for First Chapter, which advertized itself a little less sneakily than the translated title. Make no mistake: Trails in the Sky has its own contained story that promises to provide you with at least 50 hours of classic RPG goodiness, but that story is by no means complete at the time the credits role. In fact some of the game's greatest twists and surprises appear right at the very end of the game and are like to leave you frothing at the mouth for a conclusion. Fortunately the sequel is already in the works and is currently being forecasted for a Winter 2014 release (barring delays).\n\nIt would be a mistake to assume that Trails in the Sky significantly suffers from having an inconclusive narrative however. As said, the series prides itself in its monstrous amounts of text, and all of this goes into world and character building.  Unlike many Japanese Role Playing Games where characters are little more than palette swaps the cardboard roles (The Hero, The Sidekick, The Wild Card, the Womanizer, The Justice, etc.) Trails takes time building its characters with great care and detail, and the result is some suprisingly fresh new ideas and ways to use these classic character types. Which is humorous considering it is a ten year old game (ahem).\n\nIn terms of gameplay Trails in the Sky is a very classic-styled RPG. You experience in the game from an overhead camera perspective and follow your characters' sprites as they talk, walk, explore and battle. Due to story reasons the game is fairly linear in its progression: There are five chapters (Prologue, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and Final) and in each of these individual chapters you have have access a new main town that serves as the hub from which you can access numerous dungeons and areas connected to them. Once you have completed a chapter and have moved to the next hub, the previous one becomes closed off, so be careful not to miss anything. For those who want the perfect playthrough, be sure to check out guides on quests and Bracer points, as several of these are hidden. Of particular note is a set of in-game novels called Carnelia Volumes, which often have ridiculously short windows to acquire. Keeping up with these volumes until the end of the game will allow you to trade the series for either Estelle's or Joshua's best weapon in the game, so its definitely worth keeping an eye out for these.\n\nThe combat uses a classic turn-based battle system as its base. When a character's turn comes up you can choose to move, attack anything in range/move towards an enemy that is out of range, use magic, or use character specific skills. Magic, referred to in this game as Arts, need energy points (EP) to use. There are also Craft Points (CP) which are used for character-specific skills. CP fills up as your characters attack, take damage or have equipment that continuously raises its value, which maximizes at 200. At 100 CP a character can use their super move (Limit Break for you Final Fantasy fans) which will do significant damage to enemies. If you use this super move with 200 CP instead the attack even gets buffed.\n\nUnique to Trails' battle system are random benefits that appear in the turn order. These can range from Physical Attack Up, Art Attack Up, HP recovery, EP recovery, CP recovery and Guaranteed Critical. These are set at random points in the turn order and their benefits last only that turn space. Be careful though! Enemies can and often do benefit from these spaces as well, and the last thing you want is an enemy to get an attack in on a Guaranteed Critical space. Fortunately there are various techniques you can use in the game to manipulate turn order, such as waiting to reduce time until your next turn, using an attack that slows the enemy, etc. It is a system that can be a great boon to those who know how to use it and a great enemy to those who choose to ignore it, so do so at your peril, lest the monsters get all the good panels.\n\nFinally, for those who enjoy New Game+ features this game has it in spades. Levels, equipment, orbments (used to cast magic), and items all carry over in case you wanted to steamroll through the game a second time. The only significant thing that does not carry over is completed jobs and the Bracer points you received in your first playthrough. These will all have to be reacquired one by one. Beating the game also unlocks Hard and Nightmare difficulties which are not for the faint of heart. In addition the game also has a handful of things that will transfer over to Trails in the Sky SC once it has been released. Depending on how much Bracer points exist on your file when you start up SC you will get a bag of goodies that will be a nice reward for your efforts. Characters also remember which jobs you did (or didn't) for them as well. That's right: this game was Mass Effect before Mass Effect was a thing!~ Finally, a certain character's level (up to level 40) will transfer into the sequel. If you going into SC raw the game will start this character at level 35.\n\nAll in all Trails in the Sky is a fantastic breath of fresh air in the sadly diminishing classic JRPG household. The game remains relatively a light-hearted and personal coming of age story for Estelle and Joshua for the most part, but those with discerning eyes and savvy genre senses will notice inklings of deeper depths hidden from the surface, and these all wonderfully set up for the sequel. If you are looking for a classic RPG with unique characters, an interesting (and at times surprising!) story, loads of sidequests to keep you busy, and a fair case of hysteria as you contemplate when the sequel will be released, you could certainly do much worse than Trails in the Sky.","August 8, 2014","true","88.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

There is a story to be told, and it will guide you through with that end in mind.  For 90% of the game, I would say the story was . . . cute.  Nothing spectacular.  Nothing terribly unique, even.  Never, in my 30+ years of video gaming, have I seen an ending like that.  Not that you couldn't tell something was going on, but the big reveal was pretty epic.  It puts the whole game in a different light.  I instantly wanted to play through the whole game again, just to see it in context.\n\nThe mechanics are solid.  By the end, though, I was yearning for a bit more complexity.  The system was fine, but I wish there were more options in terms of equipment, orbments, and characters.\n\nEquipment was mostly linear.  You buy what's in the shop, then pick up an upgrade in a dungeon.  You just rinse and repeat for each chapter.  No real choices.  The next piece of equipment is always better.  There is the option of finding the ultimate weapons, but that is little more than the final step in a relatively linear progression.\n\nThe orbment system was actually pretty complex, but they could have done much more with it.  Once you get the hang of it, though, you can spend most of a play-through just playing with orbment combinations.  Sadly, it doesn't take long to master.\n\nAs for characters, this game was pretty unique.  Many different games have you picking up team-mates as you progress through the story; but most let you keep that character from then on.  In this game, your comrades only join you for brief periods at a time.  It's a bit irritating, but it also makes them feel more like characters, rather than just extra bodies.  Each comrade has their own motivations.  They aren't going to leave everything they care about just to follow some strangers around the world.  It makes them feel more real.\n\nThe combat was excellent for a turn-based game.  The choice to move around the field of battle turns out to be more than just a gimmick.  Rather it affords a new dimension to combat (for instance it lets you position your enemies).  Status effects are worthwhile but unessential.  They managed to strike a perfect balance.  Using them makes many fights much easier, but every fight (but one. Errrr  LAWRANCE!!!!) is possible without considering status effects at all.  Skills, S-breaks, and weapon effects make combat complex enough to stay interesting.  The turn bonuses are mostly gimmicky, but play a big roll in the BIG fights.\n\nOverall, 9/10 for first playthrough, 7/10 for subsequent playthroughs. The game is worth playing for the story alone, and the combat is sufficiently complex to stay interesting.  The game is simple enough, though, that it's only good for a couple runs and some nostalgia runs years later.","March 29, 2015","true","64.6"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's the most I've enjoyed a RPG in a very long time, and even though I purchased it during the holiday sale, it would have been worth full price.\n\nThe game runs from 30 hours to upward of 50 depending upon how many side quests you choose to undertake, and there are many to find.  Strong points of the game include character development, real careful attention to NPCs in an immersive world, an enjoyable sound track, and I personally got very much into the narrative.  The story follows Estelle and Joshua Bright, two young bracers, a guild of investigators/heroes/do-gooders, whose father ends up leaving them unexpectedly and a mystery follows.  You travel across an entire country, through five towns that each have distinctive areas, all to unravel a plot which turns several times.\n\nI won't tell you what happens, but you'll probably be like me and be waiting for the second chapter of this story to be translated and brought across.\n\nThe only thing I will say is you'll probably take a little time to level up, which can get annoying in certain dungeons.  But, that's a personal choice, and generally speaking, this game isn't too difficult in terms of fighting enemies.  I think the balance is fair.\n\nAnyway, I'd recommend it for anyone who likes JRPGs or classic style RPGs.","January 3, 2015","true","74.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Very interesting characters and the developers went the extra mile in giving personality to all sorts of assorted NPCs who you'll only see once in addition to the ~25 characters who are deeply involved in the main story. Decent battle system although nothing too complex, difficulty feels just right - easy if you do a ton of grinding and challenging otherwise - with a very satisfying final boss.

A lot of time and hard work went into this game and it really shows, it wasn't hastely made, this game was made to tell a great story AND be a fun RPG.  The detail they put into the story is just amazing, EVERY characters dialog changes and relates to your current progress in the story.\n\nThe gameplay is a little different from the normal turn by turn grid based play. Its more like a queue and who goes when and how often is determined by the characters speed.  The game also randomly assigns small "boosts" to certain turns in the queue such as "this queue slot heals 10% of their max health" or "this slot gets a garenteed critical hit". The strategy comes in when you can shift around the queue slots to get these boosts or take them away from enemies. All characters have the ability to "take" a slot with their S-craft move at any time (its like cutting someone off in line). They are game changing moves but will take time to get them back. Casting magic takes 2 slots (one to ready the spell and one to cast) and also shifts the queue around by adding a slot depending on how fast they cast the spell.\n\nThis game has so much to it, so much strategy and a great storyline.

The first chapter in the series and it looks pretty good. Definately Recommended! 9/10\n\nStoryline\nThe story starts off slowly, introducing the main characters Estelle and Joshua, their Dad. As the game progresses you'll meet a different characters, some that join your party. The start might be a little too slow for some, but trust me - stick with it and it will become literally one of the most enjoyable epic adventure/plots played in some time. At the same time you'll uncover more about the past of the characters as told by others in a great intertwined story- can't spoil too much just play it. Story is likely to be around 40 hours including sidequests etc, lots to do.\n\nGameplay/Combat\nThe main exploration done is in pretty linear maps but are not small, plenty of variety, there's some backtracking but not too bad.\nYou start off with 2 characters and the party will grow. With these type of games its all about getting better gear, managing energy points, charge and s-craft, positioning and gearing your characters appropriately for the fights.\nThe Orbment system allows for much flexibility - the key to successfully fighting enemies is gearing the right Orbments to get the appropriate skills, some are so powerful they can annihilate groups of enemies with ease - Read the in game help guide on what combination of Orbments to unlock the skills!\n\nTip: You get pre-emptive attacks when you approach enemies from behind, so try to do this as much as possible\n\nMusic\nSimilar to most games done by Falcom - the music is fantastic. All of them suit the mood - enjoyable and (especially the final dungeon theme!) epic!\n\nVisuals\nThey are quite dated, but being a game from 2004/2006 with updated visuals it looks pretty good. But we don't play this game solely for its visuals.\n\nBugs\nThe game did crash on me several times in Full Screen mode after Alt-Tabbing. But never fear, the develepers have added a secret AutoSave Page 0 so you can get to where you were without losing too much progress.\n\nHighly recommend this game for old school style turn based RPG. Can't wait for Second Chapter. Support Falcom/XSeed by getting this so they can bring more chapters in this series to English!","September 22, 2014","true","74.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I am a huge fan of JRPGs and if you are too this game will most likely tickle your fancy.  Unique yet simple battle system resulting in enjoyable combat, tons of dialogue and loveable graphics, this game has everything I was looking for.  The only downside to this game for me is that it tends to be rather linear, even with the plethora of side quests, and does revolve around "quest hubs" in the major cities.  This doesn't deter me from playing the game one bit, however.  I look forward to finishing this game and hopefully seeing the sequels get released on Steam as well!

The combat is also very well balanced - not difficult (I lost and retried less than a dozen times overall) but does require you pay attention to what is going on.\nIt is quite long and has lots of details (lots of NPCs with dialogs as well) for a game that is possibly intended for younger gamers - no blood, no deaths, no strong language, etc. But perfect for someone like me that enjoys story-driven JRPG.\nXseed Games - get off your collective butts, guys, and finish translating the second chapter already!

I'm only in chapter 2 at the moment and have only come across one game breaking issue (which I believe they have patched - it's where I had to open a chest to fight a sidequest monster and I got stuck in place after the fight ended; restarted, opened the chest from a step farther away, and no problems ever since).\n\nIt's a very enjoyable old school tactical turn-based RPG. You do not customize your character stats, but you do get to pick equipment and what magics to equip --- you don't, however, pick your clothing or anything like that. You can go and grind to get more XP and items to craft your magic ability, or you can just go at it head on.\n\nI've played some games where setting up your "formation" in tactical turn-based game was useless, but I've found it really can make a difference against higher level or higher-number opponents.\n\nThe game is a bit lightweight in the customizing department, so I would label this as a "simple RPG" or an "easy to pick up RPG".\n\nGraphics are not bad. Sound is not bad. Overall, it's just a lot more enjoyable that I thought it would be, and way, way less buggy than I thought it could have been. I hope they do the other games in the series as I would definitely buy them.","August 26, 2014","true","28.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

That, and it's my first review here so I honestly don't know how to describe in detail of how great this game is after playing through.\n\nNow, the game feels light hearted and I think it's just me because I have yet to scratch the surface of the game doing a kind of sort of blind gameplay without having to spoil it of course. The graphics are good, the mechanics and battle remind me a bit of playing Record of Agarest war without the visual novel esque like or combining attacks to take out enemies in battle.\n\nThe initial controls are confusing for me at first since I typically use the WASD keys to move around. Lucky for me, right before you begin playing there's an option to adjust the resolution, sound, graphics, and keys if your the type of cat that prefers the WASD. At some point I did find using the mouse only to speed pass enemies which, you'll encounter when your travelling from one area to another.\n\nI want to add more but I'll end it here by saying that so far, I'm enjoying the game.

This is coming from someone who's played Baldur's Gate, Planescape Torment, pretty much every game in the Final Fantasy series, Legend of Dragoon, etc.  The music was captivating and the story wasn't half bad.

I know the game came out for PSP but for a game on Steam, the list of a good JRPG game, is pretty lacking. (and it's a Tactical JRPG to be at that)  I was a little bit concerned when the prologue of the game started off a bit slow.  But once I finished the prologue and started Chapter 1, I was hooked.  The story is amazing and keeps you wondering what will happen next. From what I've heard, people are saying the game plays like Grandia.  Well I've never played Grandia but if it's like this game, I might try that game too. If I were to say some of the negatives, the normal battle and boss music is quite jazzy and catchy, it gets old pretty quickly. Not to mention in a certain part of the normal battle theme, I somewhat hear the Raymour and Flanigan furniture theme.  (BTW, you will never not hear the Raymour and Flanigan theme when you enter a normal battle in this game ever again. You're welcome! :P)  Another complaint is the lack of Anime cutscenes.  For a game that has the capabilities of doing so, I've only seen it twice.  Once in the beginning and once at the end of the game.  There's only 4 chapters and a prologue.  They could have at least put one at the end of Chapter 1, 2, and 3 but that's just my opinion. But that's enough ranting. As for this game overall.  It's a solid game with a few minor issues.  I give it a 9/10","August 27, 2014","true","106.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game has surprisingly jivey beats and boppity boops that you will never get tired of. The battle system is very similar to that of Grandia which an extremely good battle system for a JRPG and in my opinion is very underused. Like Grandia, the game doesn't feature a random battle system, but if you arent quick to avoid an enemy, then you may find yourself in combat at a disadvantage. The CP meter makes for a very diverse battle system all while keeping it simple and enjoyable. The Slot and Quartz system also makes for a huge variety in character customization to fit your playstyle perfectly. MOST characters in this game are very unique, and play their roles superbly whether it is comic relief, or intense.\n\nEven though this game is great, it does have it's drawbacks. The two main characters at times can be cliche and bland (as the game progresses they do manage to grow on you, so it's not awful). The game also doesn't have too much in terms of replayability, so if you get it I suggest doing all the sidequests and getting the most of the game on the first run through.","April 2, 2015","true","55.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

From the story to the combat system even to all the side-quests, I cannot get enough of this game. So much character development, so much story, so much (good) dialogue, so much detail, this game boasts of so much content yet when you're done you still want more! While the first 2 or 3 hours of the game start off far slower than the rest of the game, it still is amazing! If you've played any of the Golden Sun games, or of the Mother (earthbound) trilogy games, or any JRPG in general, you are missing out and must play this game as soon as you can. After playing for a total of 41ish hours (not including the time it took me to download the proper things to play this game, which is the one negative of this masterpiece), I can finally conclude that this game is in my top 3 JRPGs, or games in general. Now just to wait for the second chapter, which should be released somewhere this year and which i will undoubtly buy the moment I can. XSeed, I'd like to thank you very much for putting the time and effort of localizing this game to PC and translating all of it, I hope to see the same level of quality and production in The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky Second Chapter!","January 23, 2015","true","68.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not only is the world you're stepping into built upon the solid foundation of a rich and fleshed-out lore, but everything that you'll encounter in-game is tended to with a similarly remarkable degree of attention to detail. There's no such thing as "Villager F" in Trails; every NPC has their own name, house, family and unique dialogue, and many of them you'll encounter more than once as you go about your travels, acting out their own, more mundane story arcs independent of your own. The in-game locations feel like more than quest hubs - they feel like proper towns, living, breathing and part of a wider, bigger world that ticks on by whether or not you're in it. And quite famously, every single chest in the game has a unique phrase that appears on examining it after you've looted its contents - while it's not on its own particularly impressive, it speaks to the sheer degree of love and care that's been poured into the game.\n\n+ Great cast of characters. Trails has a lot of strengths, but its single greatest one, the keystone without which it would all fall apart, is its cast, their relationships and their interactions; your emotional investment in them, and in their stories, is what makes the whole thing tick. And fortunately, its characters are strong enough for that to work - each is distinctive, and often even exaggerated and eccentric, yet all feel very human, sincere and believable at their core in a way that does a fantastic job of bringing them to life. From the foppish and frequently-hilarious Olivier, to the irresponsible yet ultimately warm-hearted Scherezard, to the magnificent duo of protagonists Estelle and Joshua, each is painstakingly built up and fleshed out as the game progresses, and even those who are recognisable as traditional JRPG tropes on their introduction reach the finish line as something more.\n\n+ Stellar translation. Unlike certain other localisation outlets (whom out of courtesy I'm not going to name, although I will say that the worst offender begins with "N" and ends with "ippon Ichi Software America"), Carpe Fulgar have taken a great deal of care to preserve the spirit and character of the original dialogue, and their effort pays enormous dividends. Conversations which could easily have been cliche and tedious instead flow naturally, and are extraordinarily entertaining to read; the cast sling insults and good-natured jibes at each other with all the wit, precision and timing you'd expect from actual proper comedic writing, never mind from a translation. I'm being entirely serious when I say that this game is now the benchmark against which I judge all other localisations - it's that good.\n\n+ Outstanding soundtrack. I don't know how much Falcom pay their composers, but it's not enough; Trails's music is incredibly versatile, swinging from warm and comforting, to austere, to joyful, to mysterious, to inspiring and back again. It's bouncy and light-hearted most of the time, but calm and serene when it needs to be, and is fully capable of being serious if the occasion calls for it. It's easily one of the game's strongest features, and while it's difficult to convey how great it is through text I can't recommend enough that you tab on over to Youtube and go give it a listen.\n\n~ Combat is pretty laid-back. Provided you adhere to level-appropriate areas and sidequests, which is very difficult not to do because of the restrictive way that experience scales as you gain levels, you're not likely to have any significant difficulty until the final dungeon. Difficult encounters do exist, but you'll usually have to deliberately head into dungeons or take on bounty requests that you're underleveled for to find them. Additionally, every non-story encounter can be escaped from with 100% reliability, and every battle can be retried from starting conditions on loss - while again, that naturally means that you're better off looking elsewhere if you want a serious challenge, it also minimises the impact of sheer bad luck on the player, which is arguably a good thing. The combat system does have a depth well beyond what you're actually required to master, but I reiterate Trails is not the game to be playing if you want the gameplay to push you (that's what Ys is for). Although, in truth, that's really not what you play it for anyway.\n\n~ Pacing is extremely slow. Trails in the Sky cares far more about building up its setting and cast through everyday (or at least relatively mundane) interactions, and while that's obviously its own reward it's also the death of plot momentum. It's a lazy gondola ride of a game, and while there's no question that it gains focus in the latter chapters it still takes an extremely circuitous route to get there. You'll either love what it does or hate it, you'll find yourself either enthralled or bored, and there's not much that will be able to redeem it for you if you do find yourself in the latter camp. This is by no means an inherent negative, but it points directly to the question that's really going to decide if this is the game for you: are you willing to sit through a dozen distractions from the main questline if you can better get to know the characters by doing so? If not, you're probably going to find Trails a very frustrating experience, but if so then it's definitely worth your time.\n\n- Graphics are what you'd expect from a mid-00s JRPG on a conservative budget - that is to say, not much. Some nice backgrounds and environments stand out, but Trails always looked like it could run on a handheld, which is primarily because it originally did. It's certainly not awful, and it works well within its own limitations, but if you were expecting Final Fantasy XV you're going to be disappointed.\n\n- Optional content can be obscure to the point of absurdity. You're not acquiring the maximum possible Bracer points, completing all the available sidequests or collecting all the chapters of Carnelia without a guide. You're just not. If you enjoy the challenge, this could count as a positive, but doing it all without help would almost certainly require multiple playthroughs, a lot of experimentation and a healthy dose of just plain good fortune. The game is still a full experience without it, but it can be frustrating to be denied 100% completion because you didn't perform some obscure set of actions that no-one would ever have a reason to do.\n\nIt has to be said that ultimately, with Trails in the Sky, you don’t get much originality for your money as far as JRPGs go. Most of what you’ll see here you’ll probably have encountered before, in some guise or another, in another game. What you do get, however, is Falcom’s magic touch that somehow elevates an experience that would probably be mundane and cliché in the hands of any other developer to something instead wholly human and believable. And in the end, that’s really what this game is, a traditional JRPG, but one that's executed really well. Its characters are mostly fairly recognisable tropes, but they’re recognisable tropes implemented with a touch of humanity that renders them far greater than the sum of their parts. Its OST isn’t particularly distinctive stylistically, but it’s a traditional OST that couldn't really have been pulled off any better. There isn’t even really anything particularly special about the world of Liberl, but what is there has been painstakingly crafted with love and care. Falcom have taken the traditional JRPG formula and maximised it, squeezing the best they can out of every single aspect. It’s most definitely not going to appeal to everyone, but if you’re in the market for a comfy-cosy JRPG that cares far more about breathing life into its vibrant cast and setting than about saving the world (although there’s just a little of that too), then you’re in for a treat with Trails in the Sky. And who knows? It might just win your heart while you're at it.","April 10, 2015","true","64.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, while the characters themselves seem to be fairly predictable caricatures so far, the storyline is interesting and combined with the brilliant world-building is really quite something. It is also quite amusing seeing the NPCs going through their own little mini-plots and giving their take on the major events in the game!\nWord of warning though - it is extremely easy to miss your chances for things in this game; save frequently, save often and if you are the kind of gamer that likes a complete save file, I strongly recommend making use of the interwebs frequently throughout your gameplay.","August 11, 2014","true","98.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It is everything you want out of a JRPG. It has good character development, fun graphics, tons of unique side quests, comedy, a dastardly villain, customizable equipment, and more. Not only were the battle mechanics fun, but hard battles weren't hard just to be really annoying. It is this reason that I have held off playing FF games.\n\nThe story captivated me and I grew very attached to the characters and their relationships to each other. The end was extremely emotional for me, and only made me want to immediately play the sequel. It was beautifully crafted and is a thoroughly organized game by any standard.\n\nThe only criticism I have is that there are so many cut scenes and so much text it feels like a visual novel a lot of the time. Because I played this game live on Twitch, some scenes would take 40 minutes to get through. That said, the scenes did not feel forced and offered up valuable information for the story and for the characters.","October 16, 2015","true","68.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

My favorite, up until now, had been Dragon Slayer: The Legend of Heroes for the CD version of the TurboGrafx-16. This was the first game in the series, although at that time, it wasn't a "Legend of Heroes" game, it was a "Dragon Slayer" game. This awesome RPG was one of the first Working Designs ports (Lunar and Vay, anyone?), and was well-translated and also had voice acting, pretty unheard of at the time. I loved it, even though I played it some 20 years later on an [electric banana]. The second game, Dragon Slayer: Legend of Heroes 2, was never translated into English, and therefore may as well be a piece of rotting sushi as far as I am concerned. At this time, the Legend of Heroes series truly formed with Legend of Heroes III: Shiroki Majo (known as Prophecy of the Moonlight Witch in the US.) Gone was the Dragon Slayer moniker, and unfortunately, much of what made it a good RPG. I have never played the original, only the PSP version, but it is as bland of a Dragon Quest rip-off as you can get. I can't fault the terrible translation, as I'm sure the original Japanese is great, but the gameplay was designed for a kindergartner. The other 2 ports in the Gagharv trilogy followed suit, LoH IV: Akai Shizuku (A Tear of Vermillion) and LoH V: Umi no Oriuta (Song of the Ocean) were both terrible for the same exact reasons.\n\nThen came LoH VI: Sora no Kiseki. I played it on the PSP first, charmed by it's surprisingly good localization, and it was an excellent diversion to the sub-human customers that patronize the liquor store I work at. The guild/jobs system is always fun, and the amount of optional secrets is what drives a really good JRPG. It was just missing one thing. It was only SLIGHTLY more difficult than the previous PSP games. I thought if only this had a decent strategic challenge like it's battle system teases, it could be brilliant. Then the PC version graced my life. With added difficulties of Hard and Nightmare, it was finally a Big Boy RPG, Hard being the highly recommended difficulty to play on (don't waste your time with the default difficulty.)\n\nNow the game has become a true masterpiece. Melding the verbose and insightful dialogue with a strategy nerd's dream battle system, the boss and optional battles are incredibly fun, and the random battles are no longer a joke. Olivier is one of the most amusing characters I have ever enjoyed playing as. He is a hedonistic, bi-sexual aristocrat that has really cheesy taste in music and will belt out some Jefferson Starship from time to time. I can't do service to how well the world is fleshed-out. There are hundreds of NPCs, and it really seems like every single one of them has their own personality. This is not easy to do.\n\nTaking a series that I regarded as largely pedestrian and bad, and turning it into a cult classic juggernaut, is nothing short of amazing. Credit and respect to everyone involved with making this slice of JRPG heaven.","March 2","true","111.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And it stays amazing throughout the whole game.\nSadly Trails in the Sky didn't change my opinion on Turn-based combat. It can get really painful when you encounter tons of enemies and just want to run away.\n\nBUT that didn't matter because the story in this game is just out of this world. Plot twists, lots of interesting characters, sad and happy moments.\n\nFor people who are after a good story rich game. this one is for you.\n\nIf there's anything about this game I didn't like, it was the achievements.

I love dialouge and there is so much of it that even I skip some. This game is full of thick syrupy character development, Tons and tons of side missions that don't feel like side missions. Lots of choices in battle strategy and no real way to just sit back and let the game do the work for you.\n\nIt's a JRPG on steroids. The battles are fluid and fun, lots of choices to bring your characters to victory.\nEvery single battle feels like it's part of the story.\nEvery single quest feels like your actually apart of a busy world.\nThere's no missed opportunities to bring a character to life, or add some kind of character development.\nThe story so far (im only 24 hours into it) is fun and something I want to achieve.\n\nIf you pick up this game, you are going to do a lot of reading. A lot is really an understatement. You are going to get frustraited at battles because the smallest battles seem very important and intense. You will feel pressured to do side missions because they are all on a time limit. You will enjoy every moment of it, assuming that's what your in for.\n\nSomething most people haven't really commented on is the control scheme. It is perfectly designed for both keyboard and mouse, and controller. If I had known how perfect the controls were for the mouse, I wouldn't have bothered using my controller. Seriously they are amazing. I just like to have a controller in my hands.\n\nIf you like Story, if you like reading, if you like intuitive battles, and variety in the types of quests and missions you undertake, this game is for you. You need to buy it.\n\nIt's amazing.","November 12, 2015","true","30.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The characters are memorable, the battle system is fun, and there aren't enough good things to say about the dialogue. You can tell how much heart and soul was poured into the game's writing and translation, even the unique, cynical blurbs left behind if you check an emptied chest. The game even got some laughs out of me. I could recommend it simply based on wanting a good read.\n\nThe game looks great for its art style, and the ability to swivel the camera around 360 degrees definitely kept me busy in all the varied environments. You can switch up your builds with a Materia-esque system that keeps battles from growing stale. Trails in the Sky is not going to break new ground in the story department, as so few JRPGs do, but it has charm in spades.

But the last RPG I actually finished was Dragon Age Origins. I don´t really know, what happened after that point - but to me it somehow seems, modern games in this genre have lost something. Something, I´m somehow unable to name - for the time to come, lets refer to it as "Charme".\nVisuals made a really big step forward, but somehow that little special something, which makes a game unique got lost on the way. I didn´t like the last 2-3 Final Fantasy Games, neither could I enjoy Dragon Age Inquisition. For me, the genre was kind of dead.\n\nUntil last summer. I stumbled upon Trails in the Sky. I´ve heard of the game before, but I only knew it was originally a PSP Game with ... well lets say decent critcs. As a huge fan of JRPGs I thought "okay, 15 Euros - you can´t make much wrong at that price" After that I have to admit, I sort of forgot about the game since I had to work abroad for almost half a year.\nIn my winter holidays, I finally found the time to tackle the game.\n\nIt sort of left me back stunned. I finished the game in about 50 hours, In three days, in one go. I dont even remember the last game, which managed it to make me to this. I won´t praise Trails to the skies, (pun not intended) it has enough flaws in my opinion. I mean the story in the first installment is ... well somewhat predictable if you ask me and I don´t consider it very original, but it somehow breathes that certain atmosphere or charme I talked already about. The protagonists, as well as the rest of the main cast, are incredible likeable and you simply want to know, whats happening next. So, all I can actually say is - buy it, support the developers and simply enjoy it.\n\nId like to tip my head to XSeed, for bringing us such a gem. All I can do now, is to wait for the second part and hope I won´t have to wait for to long.

If you find any errros or something similiar, i would appreciate it if you can correct my language.\n\nDo not be mistaken with my playcount, i have spent many hours on this game. Yes, i use to pirate this game Now that i've purchased this game now i'm going to review one of my favorite JRPGs i've ever played.\n\nStory\nThe story starts off with 2 characters, Estelle and Joshua a member of the Bracers guild, an organization that helps citizens just like a police or something similiar. One day, their father Cassius the legendary member of the Braces guild has suddenly gone missing for no reason. Now that their father is gone, the 2 protagonist sets off a journey to look for Cassius.\n\nSounds pretty generic huh? It does. But the more you know the story, the more interesting it is. After you've defeated the Capua family the main heroes will set out a whole different journey, unveiling the secrets of the Kingdom of Liberl. From that point on, the story goes even more interesting and enjoyable for me to follow.\n\nThe story is pretty good overall, but that's the not only thing that makes this game so good, the characters. Most characters doesn't get that much attention compare to the main protagonist, but they're pretty likeable. By the way, the characters development in this game are really well done, especially Estelle. At first, i actually kinda disliked her, but as the story progress she's slowly becoming a better person.\n\nNow, for the combat. Nothing bad, nothing special to be honest, if you play lots of turn based JRPGs you should know how the combat works for the most part.The interesting one here is the Orbment, which is sort of like a magic but there's more than that. Overall, it does the job pretty well and i still enjoy it.\n\nSome Pros+ Great Story, although... (Read cons below)\n+ Great Characters\n+ Solid gameplay\n+ Immersive as you progressing with the story\n+ Great soundtrack (You have no idea how much i enjoyed the "Silver Will" theme)\n+ Nice artstyle, although... (Read cons below)\n\nSome Cons- Somewhat linear, after you leave the town there's no turning back. So make sure you've done everything you need to do before you departs.\n- Text heavy cutscenes. I'm not having any problems with this though but i think it should be mentioned if you're a type of people who doesn't like a really long cutscenes.\n- Outdated graphics. Well it's obvious because it's a port from PSP released on 2006. Especially the textures.\n\nI would recommend this game if you: Looking for a game with great story, characters, etc.\nI would recommend you to think twice before getting this if you: Looking for a game with great visuals or something new in terms of combat.\n\nMy ratings: Highly recommended! If i'm going with scores it would be somewhere around 9/10.\n\nWelp, that's it for my review for this little gem. I hope that you will enjoy this game as much as i did.\nNow if you excuse me, i'm going to save my money for getting the sequels.","November 5, 2015","true","3.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you're big on story and are looking for an JRPG with extremely well developed characters, exceptionally well written dialogue and one of the best endings in a game look no further. Trails in the Sky has one of the best and most robust casts of characters I've ever seen in a JRPG. Each character is great by being interesting, having multiple sides to their personalities and backstories loaded with depth. I can only think of maybe three or so at most JRPG's I've played in my entire life that can stand up to this game's story, characters, writing and plot twists. The gameplay of Trails in the Sky is turn based and the game has no random encounters. Trails in the Sky's gameplay is good, but not absolutely amazing. If you're looking for a revolutionary combat system or something way different from the norm the combat system may let you down a little. However, the battles are still fun and the game is fun to play. An annoyance can be though that sidequests are easily missable and dungeons are tough to navigate due to not having maps in them. Turn based JRPG fans such as myself though will like the combat system a lot, but won't find it anything mindblowing. Last, the music of the game is very good. Trails's soundtrack is a great game soundtrack and I greatly enjoyed the vast majority of the songs in the game. If you're a fan of JRPG's especially ones with good stories and you liked games like Lunar, Grandia etc then Trails in the Sky is a must play. I could very well say even despite this game's flaws it just might be one of the best JRPG's of all time.","October 26, 2015","true","44.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Worth it ? Heck yes  i will explain why\n\n\nFirst off let's start with the amazing sound track that this game has every village ever town every area  every dungeon has amazng music you will find your self humming along to the tune. This is one of my personal favorites aside from the battle theme.  You will here this theme in the begining of the game\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YLJp-g0duk&list=PLE292h2k-BT06Ni-5K-3HAZa_rx36MRVq&index=5\n\nnow for the battles\n\nYou could call the battles a mix bettern tactical and turn based. you have to decide weather you move away from the enemy or attack him or use arts. In most cases on some enemies it is best to use arts as some enemies have pretty high defens so physical attacks will be useless. Arts however do take time to charge before you can use them so its always best to take a look at the turn order and decide what to do.\n\nsome attacks can also effect a certain range around the charcter so if you are being targeted by said attack you will notice a circle around you. If othe characters are within that circle you can move them out of the way to minimize damage.\n\nThe story is absolutly amazing  it has one of those endings that leave you wanting more which is a good thing because this series go across 2 other games. I cannot say much about the story without spoiling it though. so i will leave it at that.\n\nThe thing that this game does right is each npc you come across has its own personality which is actually pretty hard to pull off. I give falcom/xseed credit for doing such an amazing job with that. Most of the time you avoid talking to npcs in rpgs sometimes. But this game its worth talking to them just to see what they have to say.\n\nI see a lot of people saying that they are going to avoid the game because the graphics look outdated .... well duh thats because this game camw out in like 2006 (in japan) 2011 in north america it first released on the pc in japan on 2004 sadly we enever got that version untill now.\n\nDo not expect the second game any time soon as the script is like 10 times bigger and has never been translated before so i wish the developers luck and i hope they take there time with it. My money is sitting here waiting for it :)\n\nSo should you buy this game  heck yes   If i remember right theres plenty of bonus stuff to do after the game is completed but i could be wrong. Either way you are looking at 100 hours of gameplay here at least","January 5, 2015","true","61.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There was so much text, detail and care put into this JRPG as I played through it, and I didn't even really explore what every NPC had to say, and missed an optional dungeon along the way.\n\nHowever, I have to say I'm not a big fan of how the combat is set up. If this game had combat more along the lines of Final Fantasy Tactics or Disgaea, I think I could see myself playing through the whole series; but this is not the case. It isn't bad, but it doesn't keep me interested in the gameplay part. The story and detail is what kept me playing mostly. 9/10, 1 off for the combat only.","June 10, 2015","true","54.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

A great game, with a nice story, an OST that fits the theme and tone of each moment of the adventure, and a  solid battle system: easy to understand, hard to master, and it gives you a lot to play around with, as you can pretty much build your characters to fulfill multiple roles depending on your needs.\n\nAnd then, there are the characters and their development. If the story albeit nothing extremely new was good, and the combat system great... the characters are even better . They show the perfect mix of humor, development  and a lot of them, even the non playable have an interesting background behind them . It's hard to find a single character you don't grow up to like, and you just gotta love some of their interactions. Plus, the whole relationship development between Estelle and Joshua is at the same time well paced, feel's natural,  and never gets boring thanks to the introduction of some anime cliches, which are however not abused.\n\nAnd hell, like any good memorable JRPG, it has it;s share of plot twists.\n\nTo sum up:\nGreat game, can't wait till they port the second chapter to PC","May 26, 2015","true","55.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If, however, you enjoy a good story, plentiful dialogue, and a world that feels alive, then it might be just for you.\n\nThis is the best game that I have played in a long time.  I expected this to just be a long, vaguely engaging RPG.  I must admit the title sucked me in.  Longest RPG?  Let's find out.  Well, it turns out it was no bluff.   It started with being rich with story line and having a large inviting world, but I was put off guard by the surprisingly good dialogue.  Some of the lines made me just stop and think, for their sheer provocation of thought.  And the dialogue keeps going too. I was amazed at how many unique conversations you could have with seemingly uninvolved NPCs, and expecially with the more prominent characters who might be just relaxing on the sidelines.  The amount of dialogue, and quality of dialogue, is simply staggering.  It's fantastic.\n\nThat's not to say that gameplay has been neglected.  In fact, the turn-based hybrid-ish system isn't quite like anything I've seen.  FFXII comes to mind, but there isn't much similiarity even there.   However, know that it's fun, engaging, and doesn't get tiresome.  The battle theme is also the classiest I've ever known.  I wouldn't have expected such a jazzy number to be the default, but lo and behold, it is.\n\nThe music certainly is deserving of acclaim as well.  Some of the tracks can fall just in the background, and not have attention brought to them.  Others can make you grin as you stop to listen to them for awhile.  The soundtrack is pretty good, overall.  No faults certainly, and some of the songs rank among my favorites.\n\nAll in all, it's a fantastic game.  I can say it's easily worth $40 to me, so at it's current price it's quite good value.  I will warn though: I can't foresee how much replay value can be found in this.  So while you can put at least 20 hours into the game for a rushed playthrough, you might also speak to every person and do every quest, relishing the atmosphere.  If you do that, you could probably spend more than 50 hours playing this.  I've put in about 35 hours of this writing, and I haven't even finished the game yet! (Quite close though). It's quite the charmer, but again, it might be something you enjoy once, and don't do again.  Perhaps like reading a good book.\n\nHonestly, if you enjoy this game half as much as I do, you'll be rather pleased. And if you enjoy it more than that?  'Twill be your win.  I hope you get this game, dear reader.  It will make a worthy addition to your library.  =)","January 3, 2015","true","58.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It should be a manga or a book :) To be honest, while playing the game, I didn't really care for the gameplay, I was mostly interested in the story.\nCombats are quite fun though, if you play on hard modes you'll need to be very strategic 'cause it can get tricky!\nAt first, I thought the music was cheap and cheesy, but I came to really love all the musical themes after a few hours. "The Whereabouts of Light" is a really beautiful song, a tribute to Joe Hisaishi's Laputa theme.\n\nWhile playing Trails in the Sky, I laughed, cried, got goosebumps from the epicness, felt tense... a wide range of emotions, which exaclty what I seek in a good story.\nCan't wait for the Third Chapter!!","March 24","true","35.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have talked to just about every single NPC in the game, read every single treasure chest text, and I do not ever recall noticing any error at all. That's just amazing, and if you take into account the INSANE amount of dialogue in the game, it's mind-blowing.\n\nSecondly, the combat system and overall gameplay is solid as well, nothing TOO challenging yet it doesn't bore you, and as you progress into the game, you will eventually realize that the game isn't really about battles at all, you don't have to grind like mad for anything and you can actually avoid random encounters altogether - in more ways than one!\nStory is good too, with plenty of humor and comic relief. It gets really exciting towards the end and when you finally reach the finale, the feels kick in.\n\nLastly, I really can't wait for the english version of Second Chapter and of course, the third and final chapter of the trilogy. Fortunately though it seems that the long wait will finally be over soon (at least for SC), and I'll definitely pick it up as soon as it's released.\n\nAs a side note, after finally finishing the game, I find myself reminded of the Suikoden series (particularly Suiko II), both share quite a few similar aspects such as story, dialogues, diversity, graphics, and the ending (seriously, saving & liberating the kingdom as "rebels" and then finishing off with a sad ending, all too familiar). As such, I believe Suikoden fans would most definitely enjoy this game, even though the combat system is quite different. Heck, anyone who enjoys a good JRPG and plays mainly for the storyline would DEFINITELY enjoy this series.\n\nTLDR; Play it for the story, you will not regret it.","June 12, 2015","true","55.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But the last RPG I actually finished was Dragon Age Origins. I don´t really know, what happened after that point - but to me it somehow seems, modern games in this genre have lost something. Something, I´m somehow unable to name - for the time to come, lets refer to it as "Charme".\nVisuals made a really big step forward, but somehow that little special something, which makes a game unique got lost on the way. I didn´t like the last 2-3 Final Fantasy Games, neither could I enjoy Dragon Age Inquisition. For me, the genre was kind of dead.\n\nUntil last summer. I stumbled upon Trails in the Sky. I´ve heard of the game before, but I only knew it was originally a PSP Game with ... well lets say decent critcs. As a huge fan of JRPGs I thought "okay, 15 Euros - you can´t make much wrong at that price" After that I have to admit, I sort of forgot about the game since I had to work abroad for almost half a year.\nIn my winter holidays, I finally found the time to tackle the game.\n\nIt sort of left me back stunned. I finished the game in about 50 hours, In three days, in one go. I dont even remember the last game, which managed it to make me to this. I won´t praise Trails to the skies, (pun not intended) it has enough flaws in my opinion. I mean the story in the first installment is ... well somewhat predictable if you ask me and I don´t consider it very original, but it somehow breathes that certain atmosphere or charme I talked already about. The protagonists, as well as the rest of the main cast, are incredible likeable and you simply want to know, whats happening next. So, all I can actually say is - buy it, support the developers and simply enjoy it.\n\nId like to tip my head to XSeed, for bringing us such a gem. All I can do now, is to wait for the second part and hope I won´t have to wait for to long.

There was so much text, detail and care put into this JRPG as I played through it, and I didn't even really explore what every NPC had to say, and missed an optional dungeon along the way.\n\nHowever, I have to say I'm not a big fan of how the combat is set up. If this game had combat more along the lines of Final Fantasy Tactics or Disgaea, I think I could see myself playing through the whole series; but this is not the case. It isn't bad, but it doesn't keep me interested in the gameplay part.

This game displays a lot of what made the earlier entries in that series so great: Memorable characters, a real variety of enemies that get steadily revealed as you progress, mechanics that reveal themselves naturally, and a lot of things to do and see.\n\n"Trails" does sometimes find itself teetering between "satisfyingly long" and "is this over yet?" Fifty hours of real, core gameplay is no small thing, for a start. On a more specific note, you have to get into monster encounters to keep leveled, and the monsters definitely aren't pushovers. Arts (The "Trails" form of magic) help out a lot, but your reserve of casting power seems quite shallow at first. This, combined with the battle system being predictable and a touch slow, makes the experience a bit of a chore in spots.\n\nAt the same time, the game does manage to keep pulling you along - the story being one reason. but also, from a mechanics standpoint, due to how decreasing XP rewards send clear signals that it's time to move along.\n\nA small technical ding is that the game sometimes grinds down to a low framerate. One gets the feeling that the graphical backend doesn't get managed very well all the time, which means that a game which could have been at home on a PS1 or PS2 will start to slog...on a GTX 970! Thankfully, the problem is relatively rare and tolerable.\n\n"Trails in the Sky" isn't flawless, but it IS really good.","December 3, 2015","true","54.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Nothing has happened yet. Also my attacks keep missing."\n\nBut not long after, as soon as the first big urgent moment started the game clicked with me. This isn't a game that rushes you along from one big event to the next, it's a game that doesn't mind taking it slow and focusing on world and character building. Yeah, nothing major happens for quite a while but once it does it means something. The slow parts give context to the urgent parts. Over time the story builds right up to the only cliffhanger ending I actually liked and I had to know what happens next immediately.\n\nThe only real negatives I can think of are the annoying amount of missed physical attacks in the first few hours and some of the later battles can become a slog. Not tough, they just take a while. And I guess the ending is bad too since you need to buy Trails in the Sky SC to find out what happens.\n\nBut forget all that, just buy this stupid game.","March 18","true","47.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is ridiculously detailed, and the story is just full of twists and turns that will make you keep coming back. This, in my opinion, is the best version of the game after playing it on PSP.\n\n\nStory+ Detailed and gripping story that's almost like reading a book ( if you don't like reading this isn't for you )\n+ Memorable characters\n\n+ Tons of side quests that also tend to be full of dialogue and have an impact on the story ever so slightly to where it feels like you've made a difference.\n\n+ NPCs constantly move around as the story progresses and aren't simply glued into a single position like some games. Even what they say constantly changes to continue where they left off !\n\n+ / - Some of the scenes contain silly one-liners; if you can't tolerate this steer clear.\n\n\nMusic+ The soundtrack is just catchy, beautiful, badass, and emotional ..! I have nothing more to add.\n\n\nArt+ Art is well done for it's time and is certainly an improvement over the PSP version.\n+ Character portraits aid the texts in depicting emotion, they're wonderfully detailed; you can feel the emotion flowing from each one !\n\n\nGameplay\nPlayability\n+ The game can be played with just a mouse or keyboard, and even both ! You can even hook up a gamepad and play, the direct input system makes it x100 easier to setup !\n\n+ Menus are extremely easy to navigate both in and out of combat !\n\nMap and Combat\n+ Gameplay is designed well, allowing you to sneak up on enemies for preemptive strikes, but be careful as they can sneak up on you !\n\n+ Has a similar system to materia ( if you're familiar with FF7 :P ), called "Quartz." Quartz allows you to apply temporary bonuses to your characters only while they're equipped, but wait there's more ! Depending on the element value of said quartz, you'll also unlock more Arts ( magic ) to use in combat !!\n\n+ Battles are a mix of tactical strategy and turn-based combat. The battles grow in difficulty as the game progresses and forces you to make tactical decisions by switching your equipped quartz to aid you in coming battles.\n\n+ As you fight enemies the EXP will either increase or decrease based on your level + the enemy's level, allowing you to easily catch up, or be prevented from going FAR over level. ( lowest possible EXP is 1 per enemy )\n\n\nEconomy\n+ Mira is the general currency of the kingdom, but it's not so easily obtained. Mira can be acquired mainly through completing requests or selling items. However, there's a secondary currency with a more major role, Sepith. Sepith can be used to create Quartz, but can also be converted into Mira !\n\n+ Monsters don't drop Mira ( why does a monster need money ? ), but they drop Sepith because they're attracted to it.\n\n\nMiscellaneous\n+ Tons of treasure chests to collect\n++ Treasure chests will troll you if you attempt to loot them after being looted\n\n+ Eating food allows you to learn recipes.. collect them all to heal your friends or try the recipe in your own kitchen !\n\n+ There's a newspaper, Liberl News, that updates you on the events in the world. There's also a novel, and a book that teaches you Cat language. Hours of reading !\n\n+ Rare fluffly shining enemies ( shining poms ), can you find and kill all 5 for each chapter ?","July 7, 2015","true","144.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has a great memorable story the characters are well designed. Some things I really enjoyed about this was at no point did I have to grind out levels (assuming you don't run from fights) so you are always moving forward, there is a ton of depth to this game but it has a very good pace so you are always moving forward you don't or at least for myself  never felt like I was stuck having to spend hours on some small side quest that was boring and lose interest and that does happen in some games I believe I did all of the sides I only did one play though I found the side quests added to the story a lot of course I missed a lot too for items like there Ultimate's and probably some other chests.\n\nI am 30 and been playing RPG's since I was around 6 back on the NES then SNES so I have played many RPG's since I was a child. Anyhow it is a very well done game, I would defiantly recommend this to anybody who wants a large engaging game with a great memorable story. You are able to customize a bit but I wont go into detail you will have to play it for yourself and find out as for myself I would like a bit more options for that but in no way was it something that held the game back. Hopefully If I can ever come up with some extra coin I will try the second chapter of this game to continue the story and if it is anything like this game It will be a joy to play. Anyway if you are looking for a solid Single player RPG this one is definitely something to pick up and give a try of course everybody is different with individual expectations of what a RPG should encompass but as for myself this has made it onto my personal top 10 list I cannot wait to continue the journey in the second chapter.\n-Nik","May 22","true","95.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

After an introductory prologue, things go awry, leading them around the region to other Bracer branches, with the goal of climbing the ranks. Again, slow start, but it really does some great character development and as more major events happen it's a great story. As the game progresses, it does manage to build up a sense of world, and characters never feel like simply AI. I've not completed the game yet, (on the final chapter now), but the game does end on a cliffhanger, expecting you to move on to Trails in the Sky SC - which picks up right where this game ends.\n\nWhile a part of The Legend of Heroes[en.wikipedia.org] as a series, the story found here is self contained. It bears little connection to the previous or following games.\n\nThe combat is topdown isometric, and turn based. There's decent stratagey to combat in choosing whether to use attacks that happen on your turn, (basic attacks or 'crafts'), or abilities that go through on following turns. All your abilities are based off an equip system, where you can chain together 'Quartz'. For the elements you've equipped in the chain, you gain access to other abilities.  Other characters do join your party for varying amounts of time (Whole chapters to smaller periods of time), with their own 'Orbments' to slot,\n\nThere's decent thought to which to equip on each character, and there is a sense of progression throughout the game, as you gain strength. You're regularly rewarded for completeing non-story quests with stronger gear, and stronger quartz (and in turn, stronger abilities).\n\n\n\nPreformance is normally great, with the occasional FPS drop in some places when traversing from area to area. Game plays just fine with both keyboard/mouse and a controller. (Both fully rebindable, but only outside of the game via a launch tool, unfortunately)\n\n\n\nYou can probably expect around 35-40 hours of gameplay out of this title, depending on your pace.\n\nIt's the first game I've played in The Legend Of Heroes franchise, (with this being the only TloH Series to see a Steam release), but it's unique, well worth the purchase, and has me interested in the rest of the games.","May 18","true","53.5"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

If you like JRPGs, chances are good you'll like this one.\n\n(As for language, the English is very good - I haven't noticed any engrish at ALL - and I've only noticed one use of questionable language, which is refreshing in an age where everyone feels the need to add foul language to everything for absolutely no reason whatsoever.)\n\nThis is definitely a title I feel bad having gotten on sale (though I might not have tried it had it not been on sale) because it's worth every penny of the full price.

Decided to take a plunge and go for it. What I got was fantastic character writing, world building, and an extremely well paced plot that doesn't even end with this game. The battle system is incredibly fun as well with its unique mix of traditional, turn-based menu actions and the ability to position your characters in ways that can make or break whole fights. Strategy and party position are as important as how optimal your gear and abilities are for oncoming fights. Party members come and go throughout each chapter, keeping character interaction and dialogue fun and interesting throughout the whole duration of the game. And since they all come back by the end, they all keep up with your current level, meaning you don't need to ever worry about grinding them up to speed.\n\nOf course, the game isn't without its flaws either. This game has sidequests. Some are pretty cool and expand on character development, but... most don't. Most are fetch quests, monster hunting quests, and boy lemme tell ya, those monster hunting quests can be utter NONSENSE. Think you're gonna tackle just one tough monster? Nah. More often than not, it's 4 or 5 of that monster you saw, and they're all equally strong as hell. And the backtracking for some of these quests is absolutely dreadful, especially if you're going for the achievement that requires you finish all of these sidequests. And let's not forget the non-descript deadline they all have. You'll think you were on the right track, only to find you've progressed the plot too far on accident and to see that irritating squiggly mark next to the quest indicating failure.\n\nAll that said though, this game is still fantastic and I'd easily give it a solid 8 or even 9/10. Everything else more than makes up for a bit of annoying backtracking and grating battles. Recommended.\n\nP.S.\nWithout spoiling anything, there's a skill in the game called Petrify Breath. Always try have that on someone. Always. It works on some bosses and can turn a tedious fight in your favor. That and freeze, which is actually a passive skill that is an added effect for all attacks with a 10% chance of success.","May 14","true","55.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Does Fire Emblem Awakening count as a JRPG? If it doesn't, I believe the most recent one I played is Phantasy Star IV on an emulator. Other than that, I've primarily been acquainted with WRPGs.\n\nBut this game is great.\n\nAs of the time I write this, It strikes a delicate balance between modern and classic RPGs. In terms of being player friendly, it is neither hand-holding or frustratingly cryptic. The graphics are outdated but pleasant, a good mesh of 3D and 2D and character portraits with a wide range of expressions (something I always appreciated since FE). The battle system calls for no mastery of strategy, but it's always satisfying to nuke a horde of enemies with a big fat AoE.\n\nSo far I spoke only of how this game might be acceptable. Why do I like it so much? The story, my dear boy, the story.\n\nBy story, I mean everything from the background of the world, to characterization, the plot, and how it's all presented. The steampunk-ish world where there are monarchs, airships, and magic goes between almost idyllic and gut-wrenching (in a good way) as events unfold. All the NPCs you meet have their own lives, and although it may be just a few lines, they change over the course of a chapter so you can see how their stories progress. The plot constantly piques your curiosity, but is not overbearing and feels natural, thanks to the focus on the main characters meshing beautifully with the standard secret conspiracy/shocking reveal fare of JRPGs. You'll grow to like them and care about them, and see things unfold from their perspective. Witty dialogue from a hardworking localization team certainly helps as well.

By making the game’s plot very slow at the start! You may find the first 10~15 hours of this game quite boring (it’s mostly about ‘becoming a Bracer’ and several “mini-adventures” which are the non-optional quests that enable you to progress through the game), but after that the game gradually starts to shine and becomes a great game with great characters and a great non-cliché plot (the final chapter of this game is AMAZING and very story-driven). Also, the game takes the biggest time possible to reveal the background of one of the main characters, which is a bummer if you’re particularly curious about him like I was. Anyway, the game ends up being a great 40~60 hour jRPG that has a nice battle system with some challenging fights and enough things to grind for to get more spells.\n\nThe soundtrack is good, some songs are awesome. Even though it has one of the most "less good" main battle themes i've ever heard in a jRPG, in general the soundtrack is good despite that.\n\nThe graphics are ‘nice’, well, this is a Remastered version of the original PC game with the extras of the PSP version AND the assets of the Remastered PSN version. The game looks GREAT on a HDTV at 1080p. But the game (and franchise) is quite old, so you can’t expect triple A graphics. Even though it can be considered quite “Sora no Kiseki” (miracle(s) of the sky) considering the original state of the original PC version. Devs had to mess with very old code and re-adjust many things. That is commendable.\n\nAnd since it was originally a PC game, it’s fully playable with a mouse and keyboard besides perfect controller support, another plus.\n\nIf you actually know how to give a chance to jRPGs, are patient enough and don’t mind over great graphics too much, this is the game for you.","February 22, 2015","true","79.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Does Fire Emblem Awakening count as a JRPG? If it doesn't, I believe the most recent one I played is Phantasy Star IV on an emulator. Other than that, I've primarily been acquainted with WRPGs.\n\nBut this game is great.\n\nAs of the time I write this, It strikes a delicate balance between modern and classic RPGs. In terms of being player friendly, it is neither hand-holding or frustratingly cryptic. The graphics are outdated but pleasant, a good mesh of 3D and 2D and character portraits with a wide range of expressions (something I always appreciated since FE). The battle system calls for no mastery of strategy, but it's always satisfying to nuke a horde of enemies with a big fat AoE.\n\nSo far I spoke only of how this game might be acceptable. Why do I like it so much? The story, my dear boy, the story.\n\nBy story, I mean everything from the background of the world, to characterization, the plot, and how it's all presented. The steampunk-ish world where there are monarchs, airships, and magic goes between almost idyllic and gut-wrenching (in a good way) as events unfold. All the NPCs you meet have their own lives, and although it may be just a few lines, they change over the course of a chapter so you can see how their stories progress. The plot constantly piques your curiosity, but is not overbearing and feels natural, thanks to the focus on the main characters meshing beautifully with the standard secret conspiracy/shocking reveal fare of JRPGs. You'll grow to like them and care about them, and see things unfold from their perspective. Witty dialogue from a hardworking localization team certainly helps as well. In retrospect, you might be able to play 'spot the cliches', but the game manages to make it immersive and engaging.\n\nOh, and the music's great too. More focus on chill than epic, but that's how the game rolls.\n\nSo I think you should buy this game, worth full price, and if you're too poor for that do buy it when it's on sale.","August 12, 2014","true","65.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story is enticing and the interactions between the various characters is fantastic. Their colorful personalities and sometimes hilarious conversations really suck you into the story. The artwork is gorgeous and the soundtrack is very nice.\n\nAll the beautiful character artwork makes it feel more like your playing an interactive anime story instead of any old JRPG at times. The combat system took a little getting used to but its not overly demanding. Its been a long time since I've so enjoyed an RPG game.\n\nThe only minor issue I have with this game is the rotatable camera. It sometimes makes it very easy to miss certain things because they just happen to be outside your field of vision, depending on how the camera is rotated. And it also throws off your sense of direction at times. Other then that id rank this game very highly. And at its current price its an absolute steal.\n\nIn conclusion, If you like JRPG games, or just plain RPG games with a good story and colorful characters, then you must not miss this one.

Basically since I can't do anything more at the moment to support this game, like buying the sequel which I will do as soon as it's available, I'll promote this release best I can. Hopefully the fact that I've never bothered to write a review before lends some insight into how I felt about the game after finishing it. There's some vague spoilers at the very end.\n\nPrefacing this by the fact I haven't invested time into a lengthy ( > 10 hours) single player game for 5~ years. I had a week before heading back to university and had a crazy urge to hit up some Skies of Arcadia or Tales of Symphonia, childhood era games that I felt were the absolute best in the JRPG genre. Due to convenience and timing of its release on Steam, settled for Trails in the Sky instead.\n\nThere are plenty of reviews on gameplay and the story telling aspect. But it's like a JRPG version of Metal Gear Solid 4, dialogue and gameplay seem pretty even. Realistically you'll spend much more time controlling characters than reading text however so don't get discouraged, it's not a $20 movie. Without going into depth gameplay is good, two small gripes though.\n\n1) You can never really dictate who is in your party until the last four hours or so of gameplay. You always have Joshua and Estelle (both completely capable in every regard) and the others sort of hop in and out of your party until the big get together at the end of the game.\n\n2) The grid for determining "artes" (magic and w/e) felt a little limited. There's a ton of options but it's not as in depth as I would have prefered. A couple characters, not all, but some are clearly intended to play certain roles.\n\nThe last half hour of gameplay is why this review is being written. Others have said most of the game feels slow paced, which is somewhat fair to say. The majority of the game is scripted and some events almost felt predictable, but the story throughout continually builds on itself. This is to say it was never boring and I never got the feeling of "let's skip all the small things and just finish this game, I'm tired of it". Overall though it's a typical travel from town to town stopping the crisis type of story. But you defeat the final boss, and a couple things happen:\n\nCutscene 1: You regain control of your characters, everyones happy, generic celebratory atmosphere. Run around for a bit, then the party splits up temporarily. One character is hit with a huge realization, like explaining all the questions you ever wanted to know about that character type realization. Immediately sets up the foundation for the sequel. No other party members witness this event however.\n\nCutscene 2: Back to the celebratory atmosphere, different setting though. This time you're in control of only one character, the rest of the party is split up relaxing and whatever. As that one character you can talk to the other party members and some of them mention some more facts that would have been great to know about sooner about the character who just went through some serious development in the previous "cutscene". The character you control runs into the other one and in about three minutes of text you are left with a huge cliffhanger and immense dissapointment the sequel isn't on Steam yet.","August 7, 2014","true","36.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's looks good on low-res display like PSP, or if you play it on TV. But on PC, usually people are barely one meter from monitor, sadly the texture looks blur.\n- This is subjective, but I do hope this has dual voice. Yes, I am aware with the lisencing issue. The English voice is good, but I still prefer the original voice especially Tita.\n\nFoods for thought :\nThis is only the first part of a trilogy (Second Chapter and The Third), and so far, only First Chapter (this one) get translated. I really hope they'll release the english version for both SC and Third. Or else, you are stuck... like me ;_;.\nBased of what graphic card you have, you can override the setting from your graphic card control panel, so you can maximize the graphic.

The characters are memorable, late game strategy is fairly complex and there's no lack of challenge at higher levels.  I love the story, and I can't wait for the next installments.  If you enjoyed Xenosaga/Xenogears or some of the earlier final fantasy installments you're going to love this game.\n\nBest features:\n- Characters all play very differently.  The story gives you plenty of time to learn each character's strengths and weaknesses, and while you cannot control your party until the end of the game (for truly legitimate storyline reasons), once you have that control you can put together some really interesting dynamics for the end game.  Teamwork is important, and many characters have skills that allow them to function in multiple roles without breaking away from their overall archetype.\n- Deep and engaging storyline.  For a first chapter I'm really excited to see what happens next.  The initial story is fairly self contained, but the characters are developed just enough to give them true depth without revealing everything about them.  It seems clear that the next installments will expand on each character, and I honestly can't wait to see it.  The bad guys are developed in a similar manner as well, and there are already indications that some of them will be returning in the sequels.  Character motivations are unambiguous (except for when they need to be), and personal conflicts are well defined.\n- Unique skills are awesome!  Individual character skills are highly accessible, very powerful when used properly, and thematic to each character.  A full party can shift gears from offense to defense at just about any time with these skills, and the enemies are vicious enough to reward both aggressive and conservative playstyles when necessary.\n- Very Limited level grinding.  XP received is based on your character level.  If you're below level for an area you will gain levels very quickly.  If you're overpowered for an area you will gain levels extremely slowly.  As such, you will quickly rise to the appropriate level for a given area until it's time to move on.\n\nAreas that need improvement:\n- Itemization is dull.  There are only a few game changing pieces of equipment.  Most are just currency sinks that keep you in line with the enemies' power curve.  In most cases characters will upgrade automatically (aside from the two main characters).  It would've been nice to see more variety in the gear.\n- You can miss out on sidequests.  If you're not careful you'll bypass a lot of hidden quests, or if you advance the story line too quickly you'll lose access to some quests forever.  There's no real reason for this other than "time constraints."  The only benefit of this system is that you can't really overpower the sidequests, but for completionists it's a pain.\n- Magic feels underpowered.  For the most part you won't really need to use magic aside from healing.  At low levels you don't really have enough MP to build a dedicated mage, and at higher levels it's difficult to stack quartz in a way that really maximizes the power of magic since the quartz that boosts magic damage is blue, and blue is primarily for healing magics that heal for a fixed amount and are not based on your magic stat.  Since you need to stack the same color to gain access to the most powerful spells, the system seems to work against itself as a result.  Magic is used in a few very specific circumstances, but any character can do the job for the most part.\n\nOverall: 9.5/10.  The games flaws are minor and nitpicky.  It's strengths are glorious.  This game is worth every cent.","August 23, 2014","true","50.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The combination of orbments attached to a person will affect which artes/spells they can cast along with additional bonus effects (artes cast time reduction, %HP, etc)\n\nNEUTRAL:\n+/- There is a LOT of dialogue in this game which may be a negative if you do not enjoy reading.  However, it is well written and enjoyable to read (in my opinion)\n+/- The story progresses slowly in the beginning (prologue + chapter 1) but picks up its pace once you reach the 2nd chapter\n\nNEGATIVE:\n-Too many generic side-quests which interrupted the flow of the main storyline.  These side-quests are very time-sensitive, so if you're a completionist then you better finish them before they expire\n-Spells/artes felt overpowered halfway into the game (once you learn the stronger AOE damage artes).  At this point, it felt pointless to use regular strike and sometimes even craft skills\n\nCan't wait for XSEED to release the 2nd chapter sequel!\n8.5/10","January 9, 2015","true","57.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

In this day and age every one in a while we get a game that has a story plot that not only hooks us, but makes us begging to want more as we play through the game, this game has that characteristic and after beating it I have only one thing on my mind: WHEN THE HELL IS THE NEXT CHAPTER GOING TO COME OUT?! Bottom line storyline is addicting. As for the gameplay it was interesting enough and as for the custimization in the game for your characters' spell sets is unique at best.\n\nNow is the game worth twenty bucks for all this?

For you FF fans, it's like modified ATB where you can jump positions based on your actions.\nThe story itself is a great ride. It starts off slowly, and builds up, just like any game really does, but the main selling point of this game in my opinion is the development of the 2 main characters.\n\nIf you haven't really decided yet, please go ahead and buy it.\nSupport this effort and you will not go unrewarded.\nI am already anxiously awaiting Chapter 2 of this game, and rest assured that when it is finally announced on Steam, I will be pre purchasing it.\n\nIt has been out on PSP for a while now, but since I don't own a PSP, I did not know of this.\nIt has been one of the best JRPG's I have played in a long long long time.\nI would definitely put this up there among the list for consideration of games that I truly enjoy.","August 19, 2014","true","60.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The characters are memorable, late game strategy is fairly complex and there's no lack of challenge at higher levels.  I love the story, and I can't wait for the next installments.  If you enjoyed Xenosaga/Xenogears or some of the earlier final fantasy installments you're going to love this game.\n\nBest features:\n- Characters all play very differently.  The story gives you plenty of time to learn each character's strengths and weaknesses, and while you cannot control your party until the end of the game (for truly legitimate storyline reasons), once you have that control you can put together some really interesting dynamics for the end game.  Teamwork is important, and many characters have skills that allow them to function in multiple roles without breaking away from their overall archetype.\n- Deep and engaging storyline.  For a first chapter I'm really excited to see what happens next.  The initial story is fairly self contained, but the characters are developed just enough to give them true depth without revealing everything about them.  It seems clear that the next installments will expand on each character, and I honestly can't wait to see it.  The bad guys are developed in a similar manner as well, and there are already indications that some of them will be returning in the sequels.  Character motivations are unambiguous (except for when they need to be), and personal conflicts are well defined.\n- Unique skills are awesome!  Individual character skills are highly accessible, very powerful when used properly, and thematic to each character.  A full party can shift gears from offense to defense at just about any time with these skills, and the enemies are vicious enough to reward both aggressive and conservative playstyles when necessary.\n- Very Limited level grinding.  XP received is based on your character level.  If you're below level for an area you will gain levels very quickly.  If you're overpowered for an area you will gain levels extremely slowly.  As such, you will quickly rise to the appropriate level for a given area until it's time to move on.\n\nAreas that need improvement:\n- Itemization is dull.  There are only a few game changing pieces of equipment.  Most are just currency sinks that keep you in line with the enemies' power curve.  In most cases characters will upgrade automatically (aside from the two main characters).  It would've been nice to see more variety in the gear.\n- You can miss out on sidequests.  If you're not careful you'll bypass a lot of hidden quests, or if you advance the story line too quickly you'll lose access to some quests forever.  There's no real reason for this other than "time constraints."  The only benefit of this system is that you can't really overpower the sidequests, but for completionists it's a pain.\n- Magic feels underpowered.  For the most part you won't really need to use magic aside from healing.  At low levels you don't really have enough MP to build a dedicated mage, and at higher levels it's difficult to stack quartz in a way that really maximizes the power of magic since the quartz that boosts magic damage is blue, and blue is primarily for healing magics that heal for a fixed amount and are not based on your magic stat.  Since you need to stack the same color to gain access to the most powerful spells, the system seems to work against itself as a result.  Magic is used in a few very specific circumstances, but any character can do the job for the most part.\n\nOverall: 9.5/10.  The games flaws are minor and nitpicky.  It's strengths are glorious.  This game is worth every cent.","August 23, 2014","true","50.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Its character position, turn-based combat in adition to the general overworld art and sprite art are also reminescent of those times and are done very well. There do seem to be some low-res textures scattered about even with the settings at max which even a lower end computer should be able to put out 30fps at. The really neat visuals are in battle though. Lots of cool anime style flashiness and over the top attacks. Abilities are lent to the characters through a neat, simple system.[wont name it out of possible spoiler] It is limited based on the particular character though which is actually a neat character development thing as it plays into their personality and story a bit. Anyhow I would completely reccomend this to someone looking to expand their non-SNES, non-PS1 emulated JRPGS and get out of the good ol' days and play something fresh.\n\n","August 4, 2014","true","1.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

And that's what i love about JRPG's they know how to make awesome RPG's and add amazing story lines and music to them, Unlike the typical american hack and slash type of RPG games that get too repetitive and start to drag as you get deeper and deeper into the game play. They need to add more fighting action with kicking and dodging and punching and slashing and pile them up into combos Dragon Nest is the perfect example, Whoops! im getting off topic lol If you like a deep emersive fanatasy love and hate story with tactile turn based combat and great animation you will love this game. I think its way better then Y's and Agarest by far. I did find some cons on the games UI and a few of the key functions. But not too much to worry about where it could affect the game play. I just wish they would make more games like this. The PSP has tons of those awesome JRPG's i wish they would port to PC. A must have game if your a fan of anime and JRPG's and turn based.

By making the game’s plot very slow at the start! You may find the first 10~15 hours of this game quite boring (it’s mostly about ‘becoming a Bracer’ and several “mini-adventures” which are the non-optional quests that enable you to progress through the game), but after that the game gradually starts to shine and becomes a great game with great characters and a great non-cliché plot (the final chapter of this game is AMAZING and very story-driven). Also, the game takes the biggest time possible to reveal the background of one of the main characters, which is a bummer if you’re particularly curious about him like I was. Anyway, the game ends up being a great 40~60 hour jRPG that has a nice battle system with some challenging fights and enough things to grind for to get more spells.\n\nThe soundtrack is good, some songs are awesome. Even though it has one of the most "less good" main battle themes i've ever heard in a jRPG, in general the soundtrack is good despite that.\n\nThe graphics are ‘nice’, well, this is a Remastered version of the original PC game with the extras of the PSP version AND the assets of the Remastered PSN version. The game looks GREAT on a HDTV at 1080p. But the game (and franchise) is quite old, so you can’t expect triple A graphics. Even though it can be considered quite “Sora no Kiseki” (miracle(s) of the sky) considering the original state of the original PC version. Devs had to mess with very old code and re-adjust many things. That is commendable.\n\nAnd since it was originally a PC game, it’s fully playable with a mouse and keyboard besides perfect controller support, another plus.\n\nIf you actually know how to give a chance to jRPGs, are patient enough and don’t mind over great graphics too much, this is the game for you.","February 22, 2015","true","79.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story immerses you into the game's incredible world from the get-go and takes you on a thrilling roller coaster of emotions that, after a while, becomes quite addictive. The game has a wonderful charm around it as well, especially when it comes to the characters and dialogue. Typical turn-based, strategy combat that can prove to be a challenge at times while not being too impossible to overcome (I'm not a strategist at all, and even I managed to kick some buttocks). Although some have complained that the quests are much the same and blend together far too easily, I've found there to be enough variance in the game- especially with the story line- that you really don't feel like it is repetetive at all. It's a very well-designed, well-paced game that keeps you engrossed in it from start to finish. And the music is to die for. It has such a beautiful soundtrack! I honestly cannot sing this game's praises loudly enough. It is beautiful, wonderful, stunning, exquisite, just... a really enjoyable game.\n\nSo glad I decided to give it a try, and I cannot wait for the release of the second installment of the series!

I spent 119 hrs on the first play through and I will go back for more with the Carry On into a harder difficulty. Is what RPGs should have after you finish them, a way to keep all you have achieved and not start again from scratch. Some of the things that I loved about it were the little details, like the battle music how it seamlessly changes depending on the situation, if the need is dire or status is normal. The availability of cooking over medicine when money is an issue. The magic system, every character is a fighter and they can deliver a decent amount of damage if equipped right. Some excel at something more than others, but gives you the freedom to choose what kind of magic/passives to equip them with.

The story immerses you into the game's incredible world from the get-go and takes you on a thrilling roller coaster of emotions that, after a while, becomes quite addictive. The game has a wonderful charm around it as well, especially when it comes to the characters and dialogue. Typical turn-based, strategy combat that can prove to be a challenge at times while not being too impossible to overcome (I'm not a strategist at all, and even I managed to kick some buttocks). Although some have complained that the quests are much the same and blend together far too easily, I've found there to be enough variance in the game- especially with the story line- that you really don't feel like it is repetetive at all. It's a very well-designed, well-paced game that keeps you engrossed in it from start to finish. And the music is to die for. It has such a beautiful soundtrack! I honestly cannot sing this game's praises loudly enough. It is beautiful, wonderful, stunning, exquisite, just... a really enjoyable game.\n\nSo glad I decided to give it a try, and I cannot wait for the release of the second installment of the series!

This game has you playing pre-defined characters through a detailed but mostly linear plotline with a bunch of sidequests sprinkled through, but little major customization options like you may be used to with Western-style RPGs.  That said, it does have an unusual magic system (similar to Final Fantasy VII's) where you equip special gems (quartzes) to be able to cast magic.\n\nThe heroine of the game, Estelle, like most female protags in a Japanese plotline, is a headstrong but overeager sort, the female equivalent of the standard "spikey-haired idiot" hero in a JRPG.  She joins a guild to serve as an excuse to send a 16-year-old on dangerous missions around the game world for pay and have optional side quests pop up in a single convenient location alongside her adopted NotBloodRelated!brother, Joshua.  Much of the dialogue and early plot revolve around Estelle trying to talk about how great a heroine she's going to be while Joshua and everyone else just shoots her down.  Beyond this, it becomes about as subtle as a plane crashing into your living room that Joshua's in love with Estelle, while she keeps being oblivious to all the innuendo everyone she meets talking about it, and she continuously "humorously" assumes Joshua's actually in love with every random named girl they run into.\n\nJoshua, for his part, is the "serious hero" role, which isn't an uncommon pairing for these types of female leads in Japanese anime, either. That is, he's the levelheaded one to her emotionality, and he's too sensitive to ever take advantage of how she'll happily sleep in the same room with him at night or ever just confess his feelings clearly enough it could get through her standard-issue anime heroic love obliviousness.\n\nBattles take place on a grid, but it's not quite a Final Fantasy Tactics.  There's no terrain to speak of, and no facing or position bonuses, so the grid really only matters for AoE attacks or if your basic attacks are out of range, which is fairly rare, as you can usually move half the map in a single turn.  Some enemies do take advantage, though, and attacks can repel your characters (or the enemies) when they land, leaving some enemies to shoot ranged shots that knock you back quite far as you have to charge through them (or use ranged magic).\n\nThings like critical hits are not percentage based upon attack, but are assigned to a turn in the turn order.  By making different move choices (magic has a large delay, while moving and not attacking has less,) you can adjust when you get your next turn relative to the enemy, and snag bonuses that give you more rewards for beating enemies or free healing, or at least deny a critical hit turn to the enemy.  The "super attack"/"limit break" of this game, called S-Crafts, lets you interrupt the standard turn order, getting those special turns to yourself, while also dealing large amounts of damage.\n\nI do have a couple complaints about how you play the game, however.  Controls are a bit awkward, and take too many button presses or delays to accomlpish simple things.  Simple things like looking at status takes 4-5 button presses, with a half-second delay between each one.  Buying up ingredients in the shops? There's a counter you have to move up and down where there's an annoying delay in the action, and if you press the confirm button twice in a row, trying to make go quicker, it defaults to NOT buying things, and resets the counter.  There's no scroll up/down button, either, and you can get a VERY large inventory even fairly early on to scroll through with that annoying delay for each and every item you have to move down. At least it has controller support, which feels more natural for this sort of game.\n\nThe game also features a few "collector"-type activities.  You gain recipes by eating new foods, and can craft them if you have the ingredients for bonus healing items on the cheap, not unlike the Tales series.  There's achievements for getting maximum guild rank (by completing the game with the correct mid-mission choices so you get the bonuses,) and for opening every chest.  (There are guides to help ensure you don't miss something.)\n\nAll-in-all, it feels a lot like the games I played on the Playstation 2 a while back, or possibly the N64, because the pre-rendered sprites of 3d models reminds me of N64 games like Harvest Moon 64.  It has slightly budget graphics, but solid gameplay.  Best of all, unlike most games that try to wear the "JRPG badge" on Steam, it actually experiments a little with the game mechanics, rather than just importing Dragon Quest or early Final Fantasy mechanics in wholecloth to worship at the alter of nostalgia.","July 26, 2015","true","127.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It reminds me of all the old RPGs I used to love as a kid and why I became so enamoured with Sony in the early 2000s. The characters are fun, the music is catchy, and the gameplay is rather addictive, especially for an old style JRPG like this.\n\nHow much am I enjoying this? I got it and Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on the same day. So far I haven't gotten around to touching Witcher 3 and this game is the reason (mind you, I can't promise it'll stay that way once I do get around to trying Witcher 3).\n\nPros:\n- Great soundtrack.\n- Good artwork and fun characters.\n- Very nostaligic feel for older gamers, especially people who were big into JRPGs around the late 90s to early 2000s.\n- Intuitive combat that feels engaging and encourages strategy.\n- Solid customization.\n- Cooking sidequest lets you learn how to make foods by tasting a sample of one, giving you a way of creating healing items outside of buying tons of the game's equivalent to 'healing potions'.\n- Bracer Guild missions are a great way to earn money, which is important as new weapons aren't cheap.\n\nCons:\n- While combat is engaging, it can become a bit repetitive when you're fighting the same mob over and over again.\n- The characters are very anime-trope-y. Tomboyish girl with a heart of gold, mysterious boy with dark hair, older woman (yeah, 'older' by anime standards, she's 23) who uses a whip and apparently likes being 'in charge' as it were. I got a giggle out of it, but it can turn some off.\n- While encounters aren't random, its very easy to get ambushed by monsters on the map and get put into rough battles if you're not actively seeking out fights. Be ready to keep some healing items handy.\n\nNOTE:\nIf you use the AMD Catalyst Control Center, it's overlay will actually ♥♥♥♥ with the game and make it bug out when you try to use a controller. I found that out the annoying way when it wouldn't let me use the menu at all. To fix this, just exit out of the Control Center before you start the game. Irritating, but a minor nusance at worst.\n\nFinal Verdict: A good solid JRPG and a nostalgia trip for older gamers. If you grew up with games like Alundra, Chrono Cross, and the like then give it a go and enjoy feeling like you're a teenager again (... well, the good bits. Not the hormones, acne, and crippling social awkwardness bits).","November 28, 2015","true","15.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The story is alright, the combat is good and the leveling system works great. It's not heavy on grinding... albeit there's enemies every 15 feet but the game keeps a steady pace on leveling so the effect of trying to grind for lots of extra exp starts to trail off if the game figures you're a good enough level to get through your current section. It's quite traditional in the way the turn-based combat works, but simplifies it for basic attacks which helps with pushing through some of the weaker enemies you'll fight.\n\nThe music is very well done, the 3d backgrounds with 2d character sprites is a neat combination that works very well! The sound effects are alright and there isn't voice acting unless you count the few words used when casting spells or using craft attacks.\n\nCraft Points are is the limit-break system employed in this game. You gain CP by getting hit and dealing damage. After 100 CP you can activate your limit-break at any time, or you can use CP for boosts or attacks via the "Craft" menu during combat which uses varying amounts of CP... it's really handy when you're trying to reserve your EP (mana) for battles or for healing.\n\nThe only big downside to this game that hopefully a patch fixes? Confusing camp menu... it highlights menus you were previously in, so it's buggy and if you leave the camp menu and return to it? It shows all the last menus you were in... kind of annoying... but it's a major bug that doesn't break the game at least.\n\nAnyways? If you're looking for a classic turn-based strategy RPG? The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is a great game to add the collection. I'm happy they ported this one from the PSP... I'd love to see more ports from consoles to PC... Lost Odyssey, Tales of Vesperia and Star Ocean come to mind. (PLEASE!!!!)","August 11, 2014","true","42.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The game does use plenty of tropes, but the writing keeps them feeling fresh all the way through.\n\nIt has turn-based combat, with a bit of positioning involvement.  And the CP system is a pretty neat way of making you choose whether to save your points for massive attacks or use them on smaller special attacks, when the big attacks would just be overkill.  Also, every character has a decent amount of customization of their spells and whatnot through the orb system.\n\nThe PC version so far has some pretty glaring bugs, but looking at the Hub page, the developers seem to be updating to fix them as quickly as possible.\n\nThis game, also, is merely the first part of an overarching story, and ends on a bit of a cliffhanger.  I'm rebuying this game here, mostly so that I can help fund the localization of the second game, coming sometime next year.  There is apparently some added content also, but I haven't read too much about it yet.  And yes, I plowed through the game, and it did take a good 40+ hours.

And that complicity,until the very end of FC, with each chapter introducing new characters to team up with, each playing an important part in the whole story, will bring you a great deal of good emotions !  But that's not all, FC standing for First Chapter, there is of course a second chapter coming, and it seems FC is just a prelude to emotionally prepare the player for the last minutes of the game and what is to come in SC. You'll have to play the game to understand.\n\nWhile FC truly shine thanks to its characters and their story, it is still a rpg, meaning a combat system. It is classic but quite good, thought some combats are a bit long and leveling is needed from time to time. The item and magic system ifsa bit unusual and feel underused. It is still rather simple an easy to use, but be aware of you spending, because you can quickly run out of money if you don't farm a bit.\n\nAdd to all that the technical part, lovely visuals, graphims, cute chara design, and a great soundtrack. Yes it is now one of my favorite rpg.\n\nSo in a few months hopefully; the second chapter of Trail in the Sky should be released, which is supposed to complete the main story. Feeling heartbroken by the end of FC, considering its ending, such a cliffhanger and all that has been left unexplored. So hopefully again. the wait shouldn't be too long before going back adventuring with my favorite bracers and their friends.","March 15, 2015","true","77.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Also I had issues of crashing when buying from shops, or cutscenes not playing properly due to graphic settings. Solutions to these are on the discussion boards, and once you've got these settled the game runs fine.\n\nCombat is pretty straight forward, with a turn based action setting that pauses combat whilst you decide on what you want to do.

Anyway, my prejudice aside, The game is solid, intuitive, and mind blowing.\n\nThe game isn't without flaws though, I strongly recommend using a controller and changing the controls. The games DID NOT port well. Also I have noticed some problems with changing resolution and making the game windowed. The game tends to crash when opening menus with these changes, Some of these problems might be fixed with patches but overall, once you get the game set up for you, it is AMAZEBALLS.

It is the first part of a trilogy of JRPG's that have so much attention to detail in them that the script in the games are longer in Japanese than the entire Wheel of Time books are in English, yet tells a perfectly paced story in a living, breathing world. The massive undertaking of localizing this game into English was only accomplished through the blood, sweat, and tears shed by the XSEED staff. The localization is not just competent, it is one of the best localizations of the past generation.\n\nBut a good localization would mean nothing if the game was not worth the 50 hour investment. Thankfully, Trails has a brilliant battle system that both accomplishes simplicity and accessibility in its design and has a satisfying depth of customization and strategy. It features a swath of compelling and rewarding side quests, a fantastic soundtrack that lives up to the expectations of a Nihon Falcom title, a diverse and memorable cast of characters, and a fantastic story that follows Estelle and Joshua's journey across the kingdom of Liberl.\n\nTrails in the Sky is not just a great Japanese RPG, it's everything you could ever want out of a Japanese RPG.","July 30, 2014","true","0.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

Since this review might be long, I'll add a 'tl;dr' section at the bottom to sum it up roughly.\n\n\nBasics\nLegend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky, is your all-around RPG, or to be more exact, JRPG.  Like many RPGs, the gameplay has fights/battles that are in the form of turns, thus making it a turn-based game.  Aside from fighting, there is a massive and well written story to read and follow and the amount of detail, is absolutely amazing.  Just to put some perspective to this game though, the game was originally released in 2004, so when you play it, just remember that you are playing something that is 10+ years old, and for a game that old, it still holds up well, and is very pleasing in so many ways.   Of course the game was originally written in Japanese, but thanks to the translation, it can be read in english by those who do not understand Japanese.\n\n\n\nStory\nThe game itself, is part of a story arc that takes place in an over-arching story that is much bigger than I can possibly explain.   This game, is the first of a 3-part series.   The story starts off with the two main characters Estelle and Joshua.   Through out the game, you play as these two characters, and on a quest to become a senior member of a guild called Bracers.   The Bracers are a group of people who help others through out the land by performing various tasks to help the people with whatever it is that they may need.   So, you start off by helping with retrievals and being a personal escort to escort someone to a location without them dying.   Naturally the difficulty of tasks increases as the game proceeds.\n\n\nAs the story progresses, there are a lot of things that are going on, and often times, it can be very confusing to understand who is who, and whether that person is good or bad.   The story has a way of getting you to believe one thing, only to turn it around and show you how you were mislead in believing someone was good or bad.   There are so many other things in the story to say, but many of these things are that of which I can not speak of or else there will be plenty of spoilers.   In short, the story is massive, and when i say massive, I mean it.   I do not know right off top my head how many hours I have logged in, but as of now, I am finally on the final chapter (I think?) and it has been a very long yet enjoyable ride with various times where I simply skipped through certain dialogues, and yet I still have a lot of hours under my belt.\n\n\n\nGameplay\nAs I stated earlier, this is a JRPG and is a turn-based game.   The key for doing well in turn-based RPGs, is to always think ahead, and not just rush in and think you can take on anything with a few swings of the blade.   In this game, there are basic attacks, spells, crafts, and items.    Basic attacks are just what they say they are, which are attacks that use the character's main/basic weapon.   Spells and crafts will take a bit more time to explain.  Items, are simply healing items that can be used to heal, revive dead allies, potions to cure debuffs, potions to buff players, etc.\n\nNow, between spells and crafts, Crafts are special abilities that can have various effects and can take time to get enough energy to use.   Regular Crafts are gained through out the game as you level up.   These types of crafts are usually tactical and some are able to deal damage while apply a debuff.  Regular Crafts only take up a small amount of energy.   Special Crafts, require a full bar of energy before they can be used, and nearly all Special Crafts, deal massive amounts of damage.  Some are singular targets, others are multiple targets.\n\nLastly, Spells are abilities that are channeled and can do various things, from dealing a type of elemental damage, to healing/buffing allies, to debuffing enemies.   Each playable character, has an item that is used to store different Quartz types.   Quartz can be best described as 'ability classes'.   There are quartz that deal with fire, water, earth, wind, time, mind, and another two I believe.   Each of these quartz gives off various abilities that can be used by only those who have selected those quartz.   This is where strategy pays off because if you have an enemy who is weak to water, but strong against fire, and you decide to go into battle with character that only deal fire damage, then you're screwed.   Same thing if you solely have one person be the damage-bringer, and one person being the healer/support.\n\n\n\nArt & Sounds\nTo save time/space, I'm going to lump these two together.   The art style of the game, is amazing.  For a game that was done in 2004, it looks amazing still and the animated parts are just as beautiful too.   Heck, even the minor animations seen that are not 'anime-styled' are simple enough to easily convey a point.   The sounds used, are great and make sense in their use.  The music, is great as well.   There are various themes that are used in places like Towns, peaceful villages, roads, dangerous places, towers, battles, surprise battles, etc.  Often times, these songs are simple but so dam catchy and can put you in the mood to do some serious battling, or to hurry and get some where.  Even as I progressed through the game, there always seemed to be a new song that I haven't heard before, so that was a pleasant surprise.\n\n\nOverall\nThe last time I played a RPG, was way back in the day when FF7 and FF8 were out, and while the music was great, and the visuals are stunning, the linear feel of it, just felt weird and the strategy aspect was confusing.   Playing this game, made me realize just how much I missed out on RPGs, and with a massive story like this, it is simply enjoyable on every level.  For people who have the patience and enjoy reading, all while having fights here and there, and not be too forced down a linear path, I highly recommend this.   If stories are not your thing, then this game might be more of an issue for you and should consider passing on it since there is a lot of reading to be done.   All in all, its a great game, its easy to pick and while tricky early on, it gets better as time moves on.\n\n\n\n\n\ntl;dr version\nPros:\n\n+ Impressive art style and music for something from 2004\n+ Very long and enjoyable story\n+ Different side characters to play with, all of which are unique in their own way\n+ Turn-based fighting leads to great strategy fights and magic abilities\n+ Average play through, assuming that half of the extra side missions and stuff are attempted, is easily 30+ hours\n+ Flat out, enjoyable\n+ Not linear like other games\n\n\nCons\n- Story might be too big or sections with heavy reading might be boring for those who don't like to read\n- Once you gain the right number of skills/abilities, you are easily able to down anything, just takes time (typical for most games, especially in late-game phase)\n- Nothing much else to complain about","January 6, 2015","true","60.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","2"

More on that next paragraph.  For a modern JRPG release, the lack of voice acting is really the only complaint I have in gameplay.  If you don't mind a lot of reading and clicking after every sentence, and you're a fan of JRPGs, or even anime/manga, Trails in the Sky is definitely something that should be on your radar.  Whether or not you should purchase it now, just after release on Steam, is another matter entirely.  There was obviously no distributed alpha/beta stage to this development/conversion judging from the myriad fatal crash reporting.  Essentially, this means you are, currently, paying for a game that (in the current trend) is really an "Early Access", although feature complete, game.  With that said, IF you can get it to run stable, it's definitely worth the investment.\n\nAs of the 2 hour mark, I had to run the game, which then minimized itself, and stayed minimized no matter how I tried to access it, for over half an hour on the 20th run try or so.  After that half hour it did let me switch to it and resolved to a black screen that then began playing the intro a few minutes later.  The game played normally after that, but on two other machines I still can't get it to run.  One of these exceeds system specs by only a bit (i3,4GB,256MB) and the game loads normally but crashes after a few minutes of play.  The other minimizes as the first machine described.  Both of those machines are WELL beyond system spec.  I'll update this review once I've gotten more play time in for myself and gotten it running on these other machines.  But my advice, unless you're able to stomach potential fatal bugs, is to wait until the forums stop reporting crash bugs.","July 30, 2014","true","2.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The character customisation is interesting also, as you only have a limited amount of slots to give to each character so you must choose which abilities you give to who carefully.\n\nIt's safe to say that this game is well worth the $20, I can see myself becoming very invested in this game.","August 15, 2014","true","11.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's a long journey, but you can cut it short by skipping most side quests, but would you? I don't think you will. It offers so many characters to love and so many little stories to be part of. You begin your little adventure as just rookies, not just the characters but you as well. The time you spend with them you'll see them mature just as you see yourself mature playing the game. It really helps as well that you'll find yourself become more knowledgeable about the battle system, because it can be a pain sometimes. But I personally enjoyed this to the fullest; I've been a Falcom fan for quite some while and I expected high, just not this high. And if you really need the push to play this game, I'll tell you this: Become part of the story and play to the end, you will not be disappointed.\nThe only thing you will hate about this game is that you have to get the Second Chapter, it's so unfortunate that it's not as a whole.","August 15, 2014","true","56.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The characters are well developed and the story line is well thought out with unforeseen plot twists.  I found myself laughing at the game conversations on numerous occassions.  You play as Estelle and Joshua and get different additions to your 4 member party as you journey through many different cities and go through countless quests.  This game is also a great price for the hours of game play, if you do every thing, probably will take around 40+ hours.\n\nThe Bad:\nThe Bracer Board quests can be repetitive and gives you a huge run-around.  However the in game rewards are worthwhile and saves you the usual tactical RPG grinding time.  At times it's difficult to figure out where to go given the quest clues.  The graphics are a bit subpar but not too terrible.\n\nIf you are a fan of games such as Final Fantasy, Nino Kuni, Banner Saga, etc... definitely check this one out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zathium/recommended/251150/","Zathium","Zathium","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zathium/","398 products in account","This is a one of a kind game that you don't see come out often on the PC, so there will be some likes and dislikes obviously.\n\nFirst off this game does an excellent job with storyline. Although each individual NPC doesn't have a full back-story exactly, they do feel like they are talking about general things that a normal person would bring up in conversation given the chance, and due to this game's highly dialogue based nature, this is an excellent thing. Whether you choose to talk to them or not, this leaves the idea that the civilians aren't just placed there to fill up space and look pretty, and the interactions can be nice. If you don't want to talk to them that's always an option, but the fact that they aren't just there to be there is a bonus.\n\nDialogue as mentioned before plays a heavy role in this game, so if you don't like reading you could skip through all of it... But you will end up missing a ton. Granted the dialogue isn’t boring either. I found myself chuckling at the interactions between the main characters and those they come across because the dialogue isn’t just filler with information before you go on your next mission. It's the development of character and throughout the game, you will definitely see this. Each mission has interactions and if you pay attention or not, you can see the gradual change in thought process of the main characters, giving them plenty of development throughout the story and making you feel more connected to them whereas other games take quests as a "This is your objective, go to it" approach. This game does an excellent job of providing the plot with useful amounts of development while still keeping it shrouded in mystery. Yes we do see things the main characters would not be able to see occasionally, but this still gives away nothing as to what is really going on, allowing us to figure things out along with the characters in the story (Though at some points it could be rather hilarious.. Such as later in the game when the main characters are shown a picture, and have about six lines of dialogue before noticing the obvious ship in the background).\n\nNext up is the battle system. This had some ups and downs with me, however; the overall flow of it is smooth and solid. The battle system is not overly complex, and some of the oddities in it (such as enemies being pushed back each time they're hit), adds an extra element of strategy, such as you can push an enemy with an attack into an AOE skill about to go off the next turn. I like the idea of special skills not using mana (EP), but instead using a new element called CP. This allows characters to use their "ultimate" move, along with other character specific skills that can't be obtained through the use of quartz. This brings me to my next fascination of the game. The skill system, although it can be complex to grasp at first, is very fascinating since the skills you obtain get better as you progress through the story and not simply through standard leveling. Meaning whether you rushed through the story, or stuck around for quite a bit, you will still be on the same level for skills since new cities give you the chance to get new abilities. The bracer notebook goes into better detail of how to set up your characters so that they obtain newer skills, but you will get the hang of it by around the second city you arrive at. The skills allow you to set up your character any way you want, and change it to something completely different to fit the situation at any time (Except in battle of course).\n\nCons of this game. There aren't many and even though there are some, they are barely enough to even put a scratch on how good this game is. The dialogue is very heavy and you can find yourself in a cut scene for anywhere from five to ten minutes (If you actually read through everything), so anyone who is not a fan of reading will be turned away by this, but in the game's defense the dialogue is far from pointless babble, and actually serves to developing the plot and characters.\n\nThe skill system. Although it is complex at first to grasp and you may have to look up something online to help you understand it (If the bracer notebook doesn't explain it well enough), it provides a skill style that I haven't seen before on the pc, and allows for a more tactical approach to the game other than, "Is this skill better than this one? If yes only use this skill." Once you get the grasp of it, it won't be a problem at all.\n\nThe battle system. As many people are used to with turn based strategy games, the move option is normally used to set up a shot on something or move, then attack. In The Legend of Heroes, this is not the case; everything is a one turn only thing. Meaning that if you want to move, you can only move, and then your turn is up. I was thrown off myself by this style and found it a little annoying at first since I had been so used to being able to move into a certain position before carrying out my attack, rather than just rushing and slashing if you're going to attack. This however is still not a crippling factor that would ruin the battle system. This makes the player make that tough choice on whether it would be better to attack or move, such as if an area of effect skill is being cast on one character, would it be better to move him away to avoid having your other units hit, or would it be better to take the hit in order to get in extra damage? This may turn some players away, but to me it is just another factor that adds to more tactical decision making in the field of battle, and shouldn't be considered an overly negative thing. It is just a new battle factor that I found rather enjoyable after playing for a while.\n\nOverall: This is an excellent game. Everything flows together well, you feel like you're actually watching the progression of character as you play throughout the game, and the battle system is new and unique in its own way. Yes there are the small things mentioned above that could turn some people away, but that's more of an individual thing than just "This isn't a shooter, so FPS guys shouldn't play this game if they don't like turn based strategy." This game has more than enough play time and effort put into it to make it well worth what you would spend on it.\n\nTry it out for yourself and see how you like it! I certainly enjoyed it and I'm not even fully done with the game yet! Though the plot does kick up later in the game (Where I am currently at), so if you stick around to the end, I'm sure you won't be disappointed!\n\n-Zathium","August 6, 2014","true","36.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

This is an excellent JRPG by Falcom that has been masterfully localized by the excellent people at xSeed. For those few of you who may not be familiar with Falcom they are a wonderful RPG developer (they also make Ys) on par with old school Square Soft before squenix went all stupid. About the only negative thing i can say about Falcom is that they dont do localization and have no interest (in truth its probably inability as they are small) in localizing their games. Thankfully we have xSeed who specializes in this, but they do ask that we buy their localized games if we want them to continue doing so. So if you like JRPGs, especially old school, then please buy this game so and enjoy so that xSeed will keep bringing us more. And remember; if your parents refuse to buy this for you then just wait till they are asleep and steal their credit card (not recomended) trust me you will all laugh about it later (probably not).","August 12, 2014","true","77.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Always before it has been ports from consoles, for the most part.\n\nHaving only briefly played this game now, after circling around the purchase for a few weeks after reading reviews, I will say this:\n\nThis is the first I've tried that gets the PC formula right.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Logiak/recommended/251150/","Logiak","Logiak","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Logiak/","577 products in account",""JRPG fans, will probably enjoy this title."\n\nTo be brutally honest. The screenshots don't do the graphics justice. They are apart of the game and all, but when you actually play it, it looks fairly terrible. That being said, I feel that the focus of this game was anything but the graphics. I've played up to the prologue, which to that point, I think I can justify any pros and cons I have with it.\n\nFirstly, I felt that at the very start, the information was being crammed down your throat. I know it's because they want you to start understanding what these characters are about, but still, it really bugged me. But about 10 minutes in, it lightens up to a much more comfortable feel. The main characters banter back and forth, ALMOST everyone has there own name and a minor amount of character backstory, and the world seems to interlock with everything very well. The setting is steampunk and magic is just this focus of these sources of power, which power anything mechanical. It's all fairly clever.\n\nSecondly, the controls and combat. The controls, bug me alittle. They are rebindable, so this is barely a complaint, but if you leave default on, its either aim with the mouse, or arrow keys, which was alittle jarring. Outside of combat though, the movement was fine and I didn't really have trouble moving at all. The combat, which is grid and turn based, is fairly nice. Everyone in the battle has a portait on the left in order of who's attacking next. Using arts, (magic) will take a turn to summon, using Crafts (Abilities) will take points out of another bar which will increase within taking and dealing damage, and it carries over battles. There's also a surprise attack system, where sneaking up to a monster and charging at them from behind gives you a massive advantage, and vice versa. Theres also npc's that get involved aswell, which won't fight and may or may not be targets to the monsters.\n\nSo far, I've enjoyed the time I've been playing, which the prologue, I'd say is about 6-7 hours long, but this was me walking around, attacking alot of monsters and talking to alot of people. I've run into several crashes, which I think were related to having the aspect ratio uneven. The game seemingly needs to run in a square window, otherwise it may have problems. Aswell as I've managed to get stuck in a npc before, so I couldn't move but I got out of that without too much hassle. Really, In the end, this is not a shiny game. Theres 2D sprites, polygons, you name it. But so far, the characters are mildly interesting, the plot is typical, but still enjoyable, and the combat can get challenging depending on how much you grind, but theres so difficulty options. Otherwise, I personally am enjoying this game, mostly to see more things that are based around this universe and I've enjoyed a good portion of the game, when there not shoving too much information in one conversation. JRPG fans, will probably enjoy this title.\n\n8/10","August 1, 2014","true","62.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kkliq/recommended/251150/","kkliq","The Yo Tornado","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kkliq/","510 products in account","When I first got a Playstation when I was seven years old, my first game was Lunar 2: Eternal Blue. Shortly thereafter I picked up a game called Grandia. Both centered around teenaged protagonists traveling the world with a group of friends, helping others, finding love and defeating evil with a lighthearted tone rarely seen in RPGs then or now. They were simplistic to be sure, but the joy and wonder of exploring a new world with characters you grow attached to was very romantic to a young kid at the time. As time went on those games, along with JRPGs as a whole, seemed to fall out of favor. JRPGs today rarely scratch the itch that those games scratched. Enter The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky.\n\nWhat Trails in the Sky does better than any recent JRPG is world building and characterization. There's a great sense of excitement as you wander the continent, wondering what new location will surprise you next. The world does a great job of feeling like a living, breathing place as well. Any time something major happens in the plotline, you can be sure the denizens of whatever city is currently your home base will have new and interesting things to say regarding it. The quality writing and translation extends to your party members as well. Estelle and Joshua are both enjoyable protagonists, able to seem familiar to anyone who's played a JRPG before while also avoiding any of the overly tropey character traits typical of a JRPG lead. They feel like real people and manage to carve out a niche in a genre that's become bogged down with samey characters.\n\nNo one is going to confuse Trails in the Sky for a groundbreaking game that flips the genre on its head. What it does manage to do, however, is feel like a natural progression of the games I fell in love with as a kid. It has been far too long since I was able to feel that childlike wonder of exploring a brand new world within a JRPG. Things like meeting fun new characters and hoping they would eventually join my party, or scouring every corner of a dungeon for treasure chests, or simply going around town talking to people to see what interesting things they have to say. Trails in the Sky makes me feel like a kid again, and for that I can't possibly give it a higher recommendation.","July 31, 2014","true","14.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

You could really do way, way worse than giving Trails in the Sky a look. In many ways it harkens back to the likes of Grandia, going for polygonal maps with 2D character sprites slapped ontop of it, though coming, even in it's original form, on more modern hardware, the fidelity is rather better here. It also throws out the random encounters and goes with having your opponents visible on the map, and sports a neat positional combat system in which player and opponent positioning play a significant part, particularly when you start throwing out Area of Effect magic and skills. There's a pretty decent degree of character customisation as well.\n\nThe story, well, I guess it's charming. Again, it's pretty throwback - if you are the sort who gets annoyed at modern anime trappings, there's actually probably not too much for you to be worried about here. I mean, the protagonist is a young lady, but manage to avoid a lot of what are generally considered the more negative "moe" stereotypes. Honestly, if I had a major complaint about the writing, it's that most of the really exciting stuff happens right as the game is wrapping up, but I guess that's what the forthcoming sequel is for.\n\nThe game runs like a charm on less-than-premuim hardware (I ran it at 1080p output to the telly from an HTPC running an A6 with no additional GPU, and it pulled a constant 60fps without a single hiccup), though there's a couple of places (and I stress "couple" here) where it shows that it was originally formatted as a 4:3 rather than a widescreen game - be amused as you can see characters standing on the edge of the screen, ready to make their dramatic entries! It just adds to the charm I guess. Gamepad support is pretty decent, too, although I say that about anything I can play using an older DirectInput-style device (in my case, a PS3 Neo-Geo pad).","December 19, 2014","true","52.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What hasn't been in that formula is a PC dedicated titel.  Always before it has been ports from consoles, for the most part.\n\nHaving only briefly played this game now, after circling around the purchase for a few weeks after reading reviews, I will say this:\n\nThis is the first I've tried that gets the PC formula right.  The graphics are beautiful, the sound is excellent, the interface makes sense for a mouse/keyboard combo.  To be blunt, you want to get this game.  The other reviews are accurate.

Once winter 2013 finally arrive in summer 2014 I bought multiple copies on steam to share the love. So obviously I loved it and I replayed it. I find this game to be very close to perfect. I won't compare it to other games because there is no need for that. It has everything I want in a RPG. Great characters, music, towns, NPCs, solid turn based combat with a nice touch of customization, and of course a great story. The pace of this game feels episodic to me because every quest has its own plot and every npc has their own thing going on.\n\nThe gameplay is a bit old and it might scare away a lot of people but if you like slow paced (its really not that slow) games you should love this. Its pretty easy to rush forward and avoid battles but you will most likely get sidetracked by all the content and dialogue!","October 16, 2014","true","80.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The plot is perfectly predictable, with a final act twist that a blind person could see coming, and really doesn't develop any original themes.\n\nThe characters all fulfill the archetypal roles of hot-head female protagonist, perfectly normal protagonist with a mysterious past, hypersexual tag-along (there's more than one), cutesy genius who has no right to be fighting monsters, etc. This would also be forgivable, but there's very little character growth, sure there's enough development of each character's backstories to make them each feel like their own person, but aside from the two main protagonists, each of them ends up feeling like a one-note joke. It was difficult to develop any real attachment to the characters, especially as the game cycled them in and out of the party as story demanded.\n\nThe most egregious part of the game however is the battle system. It's boring, slow, and punishing if you don't read the in-game manual about customizing your arts. The arts system is derivative of other past RPG systems. Think the materia system in Final Fantasy VII but with less materia. By the end game, some characters are clearly just better regardless of their stats or eqipment based purely on how flexible their own "grid" is. It seemed unnecessary to limit characters like that, and ultimately felt unbalanced.\n\nNow I've probably done a poor job of balancing my positive and negative comments here, these are just my observations. My criticisms above aren't game-breaking, but they do make it difficult to recommend this game to anyone other than a die-hard JRPG fan in need of their next fix. Because if that what you're looking for then this game will scratch that itch. But for anyone else, while this is a perfectly serviceable game, spare yourself the 20+ hours that could be spent elsewhere.","May 26","false","41.7"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","4","9","2","0"

One of the quests only becomes available in a tower JUST before you move on to the next story arc (annoying!). There are also moments during quests where you need to make a decision, your choice will have an influence on your bracer score (if you care) and may alter enemy encounters.\n\nThe magic system is pretty simple but some of the later AOE spells make other spells and melee redundant.","August 3, 2014","true","11.0"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/canufeelit/recommended/251150/","canufeelit","Jimmy Russel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/canufeelit/","41 products in account","SHORT VERSION: If you like games with well-crafted lore and setting, lovable characters and excellent attention to detail as well as world-building, this game is definitely for you. While it may start out slow, it's because it takes it's time to build up, and in the end it will be all worth it.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nHave you ever felt nostalgia for something that you haven't played yet? This was what I felt when I started playing Trails in the Sky. Made by Falcom back in 2005, Trails in the Sky tells the story of a plucky young tomboy named Estelle, and her adopted brother Joshua, as they take on the role of junior members of the Bracer Guild, a group that undertakes tasks and requests to protect civilians and maintain the stability of their country, the Liberl Kingdom.\n\nThe story itself is very well presented, and is really something that modern JRPGs lack. The characters themselves are likable, with humorous banter, good one-liners and engaging dialogue when push comes to shove. The amount of foreshadowing is insane, having the subtlest detail early on in the story developing and playing a huge role later on. While it starts out fairly tame, with a bit of a slice-of-life atmosphere as you take on various sidequests from the Bracer Guild, it slowly becomes evident that something is happening within the kingdom, as numerous incidence and weird coincidences occur starting from an airship hi-jacking, which escalates into a full-scale conspiracy. The feel itself is reminiscent of late 90s to early 00s JRPGs like Suikoden and Xenogears, as the developers themselves wrote the story for years before they could even make it into the game, making sure that no plotholes or sudden asspulls happen in the story. There is focus on world building too, as there are various notes and NPCs in the game that shed some light into the history of the Liberl Kingdom, from political structure, history of the royal family, political events and relations with its neighboring countries, as well as regional customs. This can also be seen in reading the Liberl News issues, an in-game newspaper that can be bought and will not only shed light on recent major events that your characters have partaken in, but also show off backgrounds of places and traditions in the kingdom.\n\nThe gameplay involves traditional turn based JRPG action with a bit of tactical movement thrown in with the use of movements in grids and heavy emphasis on turn order manipulation. Its a relatively simple formula, but becomes interesting as you gain more skills that work with turn order. Unlike most JRPGs before, status effects are actually good in this game and is key to making short of hard to kill enemies and/or bosses. The skill system has a bit of depth in it, promoting mixing and testing different combinations of gems (or Quartz in this game) that results in different skills.\n\nExploration is open-ended. While the game doesn't have a full world map and eschews for interconnected highways and roads like Final Fantasy X, the game encourages players to explore areas that are available to the from the get-go, which rewards players with good equipment, good leveling spots and sidequests. Sidequests in this game are entertaining, as they're not just fetch quests or eliminating X numbers of monsters, but rather involve bit of investigation and decision making for full reward. This, coupled with the characters throwing witty dialogue makes sidequests fun to do and not feel soulless or seem like padding.\n\nAs with all Falcom games, Trails in the Sky excels in the music department. The musical score ranges from a jazzy battle theme and upbeat field music, to relaxing seaside themes and orchestra. The selection makes every scene count and fits right in whether it be a sentimental one or while traversing along the highroads. Just the opening theme itself gives the player of what to expect from the game, starting slow and steady and slowly making its way to an epic orchestra.\n\nAs far as it goes, Trails in the Sky is one of those games that I really really want to promote, its a very under appreciated and niche gem, made with a lot of heart as well as attention to detail and good story telling. With a good amount of drama, mixed with political intrigue and with a dash of humor, Trails in the Sky is a game that harkens back to the days of quality JRPGs.","December 8, 2015","true","62.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","40","2","5","2","0"

Gonna start right out and say if you dislike dialoge heavy RPGs you'd best skip it, lol\n\nAnways, this is a turn-based JRPG with combat that involves a grid with players and enemies having a certain movement range and attack range - its not FF style where everyone lines up in a row and whacks each other. Spells are rather unique and vaguely similar to FF7's Materia in that each characater has an "Orbment" that they can slot "Quartz" into and depending on the color and amount of Quartz you'll aquire new spells for use - sorta confusing at first but it works out to allow you more character customization than most JRPGs.\n\nThe game's story seems to be driven by the "Bracer" guild in which the main characters belong to. These Bracers take jobs at the guild job board and complete them. There are main Story jobs and then Minor jobs and quite a few at that! Its nice to have side quests more directed and meaningful, imo. The more jobs you complete the higher your guild rank increases and the better your rewards.\n\nAll-in-all its a VERY solid JRPG with a great deal of humor but also isn't afraid to be serious. Most importantly, though, is its fun and addicting! This is most definitely one of the most in-depth and long JRPG stories you'll find, every NPC has many, many things to say as the story develops and you'll find yourself going back to them to see how they are responding to events and what changes they've undergone!","July 31, 2014","true","12.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's very much a JRPG and everything good that comes with it. The gameplay is great, battles promise a lot of diversity and the story offers just enough flexibility that you'll wonder, "What if I didn't get Dad that paper?" or "What if I rushed in without Joshua?" while still maintaining enough structure that you are experiencing a well thought out and developed experience. Such fluidity in the story and setting combined with excellent presentation allow you to feel that the world exists around you, which granted, may be preemptive of me to say, appears to be an accurate assessment of how the game is going to play out from here onward.\n\nBut I do have some complaints in that it is a JRPG, and with that comes some grievances in dialogue and storytelling. It's great, don't get me wrong, the localization is of the highest grade and a clear amount of polish and love was put into not only translating the game from Japanese, but also adapting it so that nothing comes across as lost in translation. Of course, that being said, I couldn't help but twist my lips at how "on point" the characters appear at first glance. The retorts are sharp and witty, consistently, which to some may come across as scripted. Because they are. This may not bother you, as the dialogue is funny and witty and sophisticated, but it bothered me. This is a common trait of JRPGs and especially in the beginning of stories, and to this game's credit, it has a lot of story to establish in a short amount of time, so better to get it out of the way now. Hopefully the characters will humanize a little better later on.\n\nAlso, keep in mind that this game is a port of a port of a game that was originally released on Japanese PC's way back in 2004, and while it has aged considerably well, if you're expecting the same kind of flashy graphics as in Agarest which embodies a similar art style, you'll get some of that, but just remember this game is over a decade old at this point. That isn't to say that, with that in consideration, the game isn't good looking and charming, because it is, but just keep that in mind.\n\nAll in all, with just an hour into what is being toted as a 40-50 hour game, I'm looking forward to the remaining 39 hours. And at $16.99 at the time of writing, the price ain't half bad either.","August 1, 2014","true","5.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

So I can't really give comment on the game stability other than it works fine for me.\n\nThe gameplay itself is simply the most traditional old school japanese RPG style gameplay. Fixed characters, unskippable scene transitions (you can skip dialogues by keep clicking), conservative romance, challenging boss fights, interesting combat paper scissors rock mechanism (which is quite old by today standards). This game afterall, is already a decade old.\n\nMusic was beautifully composed, and stood among the monumental video game musics in Japan at that time. Character design is old school, just like the old Chrono Triggers FF series and inherited the same writing style of its peers (Ys series). However if you are looking for something like BG 2 or DA:O kind of epic stories and characters, this is not your game. Not that it's bad, it's just nothing like that. It's traditional Japanese only fit with a twist of western fantasy drawings. The romance has no sex involved and the western style of bluntness to express yourself is considered reckless or vulgar in many cases. So you might have to put on another pair of shoes if you're new to Asian culture.\n\nIt pleases me that Falcom remains one of the few Japanese devs that still stick to their guns to keep the fun element as it is in a JRPG, instead of trying to please the modern crowd turning RPGs into action games. Even though they are only publishing console versions for their latest titles, I do hope the sale figures in Steam could let them consider a come back in PC market.\n\nVisit this link if you want to know more about history of this game.

I was glad I did as it turned out to be one of the best experiences for the Vita.  Now, we have a PC version.\n\nI'll keep this simple for those who do not want to read a lot of text.  This game is very text heavy, so if that is a turn off for you, then you may want to skip this title.  For those who like to read text (like me) then this is highly recommended.   The battle system is turn based, but there is a movement grid involved which adds some variety to your typical old school JRPG.  Once again, if you like this style, then you should like this, if not, you may want to keep moving.\n\nThe story starts off a little boring, but it gets better the more the game moves forward.  That is not the main draw for me as I kept playing to see the characters.  That is what makes the story so great is how much you want to see how they react to a given situation.\n\nI will leave it at that as you can look at the screenshots for the game to see the graphics.

Trails in the Sky: First Chapter is one of those very special games that need both of those as, once you are one of those who can and will respectively, are rewarded very well.\n\nTrails FC is methodically paced, exacting, and defiantly true to its vision of the type of JRPG it is and is extremely strong for it. Dialog, world-building, characterization, theming, music, art paint the game splendidly as being as big as a nation yet as small as those little moments in Estelle and Joshua's journey. It's rare to get a writing crew that just lets characters talk and not only pull it off but use it to paint characters.\n\nThe music is top-notch Soundteam_JDK quality, but more eclectic, experimental, and mellower than most are used to.

Their father, a senior in this organization has been called away & they are expected to carry the weight of some responsibilities sooner then expected.  While the story is somewhat typical Jrpg fare,  one of the things to note is that NPCs do tend to say slightly different things depending on when you speak to them, there's seldom cookie cutter responses.\n\nCombat, is both turn based & tactical. Once begun you can either move, attack, use Arts (magic), Crafts (special attacks), or trigger a unique & often powerful S-craft attack.  In the latter 3 cases there's a meter, magic costs a certain amount of points, while the Crafts meter is built up by either getting hit of hitting foes, S-Crafts have 2 tiers, at 100 you can do a certain amount of damage with it, but at 200 you can inflict a far more substantial amount of damage & is usually a 100% guaranteed hit on enemies.  While it's not necessarily one of those, "easy to learn, tough to master" type of things, there's a great deal of depth involved & no battle will be the same way twice simply based on how much you want to experiment in this. This also makes the inevitable level grinding less tedious then it otherwise would seem.\n\nI'm still hoping that we get the other 2 chapters.\n","May 7, 2015","true","61.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If you enjoy a good story that evolves as it progresses and can handle somewhat basic battle systems, you will enjoy this game.\n\nThis game originally came out back in 2006 and recently was moved to Steam. So its to be expected the graphics are not the best, but it was charming. However, the story told through these graphics is very awesome.\n\nAt first you might see the story as fairly clean and friendly, but it becomes more and more rich as the game goes on. You meet new characters, unravel plenty of mysteries and the ending is a giant tease.\n\nAs for gameplay, the game play much like any tactics style RPG. Though despite similarities, it still manages to stay refreshing. The biggest downside is that it pretty much relys on its elemental resistances and main attack vs magic attack and doesn't get any more challenging. They do however, use this system to create some fairly difficult battles in the later part of the game.\n\nI apologize for this review being much smaller than my others, but I was putting off writing this and decided I would just get it out there to let the world know how awesome this game is.\n\nVerdict (1 meaning the worst, 5 being par and 10 being the best): I give this game a 7. I wanted to give it a 9 because I personally enjoyed the game a lot, however, its an older game in a newer market. Awesome soundtrack too btw.","January 23, 2015","true","91.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Trails in the sky is a gem of a JRPG. The characters are great and 3 dimensional and each gets their own share of the spotlight and character development. The combat, though a little strange at first, is easy to understand but harder to fully master.\nThe game is broken up into five segments  each segment has their own little story with a bigger story unravaling as each segment becomes completed. This keeps the story from becoming stale and as mentioned before gives each character time to shine.\nIf you are craving a big RPG like I sometimes do, then look no further than The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky.

Legend of Heroes sort of takes me back to feelings of Secret of Mana and some classic style RPG's, yet it has some modern integrations regarding menus and it's "magic" and battle options.  I don't know - it feels like a revamped classic style RPG.\n\nAnyway, I would pick this up for $10-15 if you catch it. I think it's going for a little more than that as I write this.

If you are looking for oldschool-feel RPGs that are more story-content/script driven and just an overall adventurous feel to it, this game is right up your alley!

Music is good as well\n\nCons:\n-Battle system idea is great, however the tactical combat could use a bit of work to allow more complex battle strategies since it got a bit repetitive near the end\n-I was looking forward to more hidden rooms/quests, side quests, and aftermath content\n-I actually didn't use any food for the entire game, maybe items can be balanced more\n-While the quartz system is good, aside from S crafts I would probably give the characters their own unique quartz/spells and affinity/stats boost to certain elements\n","March 20, 2015","true","60.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I prefer turn based games versus the more popular real time fighting styles, which makes it rather tricky to find a game that I like for pc, as I don't have a different gaming console.\nThis game is much better than I thought it would be. I hadn't heard of it before, so didn't know its anime, or PSP renditions going in. The game is much more complicated than I anticipated (the prologue was a little confusing for me with the orbs, quartz, etc, when I was just reading through the explanations), but it quickly fell into place and was pretty straight forward. The heroine is a little annoying at times, but she is a sheltered, headstrong 16-year-old, and the other characters call her on it, and she is an interesting foil to Joshua, the male lead. As the game progresses, her behavior matures a bit, which is rather astonishing to have character development in a game like this.\nMy only complaint about this game is to do with the conversations. THere are A LOT, and you can hold down a key to try and speed through the speech bubbles, but that doesn't help much. It gets annoying very fast, and very tedious, especially since there isn't a way to exit out of a conversation, and EVERY NPC has dialogue. In its sequels, I hope this is changed. Some chapters have so much dialogue, you have to take frequent breaks to not get frustrated (at least, I did).\nThe game has replayability factor, is incredibly detailed, and the vernacular is great! There are allusions to sexuality, but it is not blatant, no boob armor, and the humor isn't overdone. It really is a very good game. I am tempted to get a console to play its sequels that have been released already in other mediums.","January 23, 2015","true","024.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I think that I'm now qualified to give this gem the review it deserves!\n\nGames like The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky are certainly a rarity nowadays. Games that are story rich, character rich and driven by the characters as well as the story are very, very rare. This game's story is interesting, the characters are cool and very likable and they are BELIEVABLE. They aren't just NPCs along for the ride, they are dynamic, they change throughout the game.\n\nAs for the gameplay itself, it's amazing. Haven't seen great handling like this since Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies. The graphics aren't the greatest, but the gameplay more than compensates for that.\n\nThe battle sequences give me a good bit of nostalgia and remind me of all the great turn based JRPGs that I used to play on the Nintendo DS years ago. There are also main story quests as well as side quests.\n\nThis game is no cake walk. You will die a lot if you aren't careful. Make sure you stock up on healing items! Also (for later in the game) make sure you buy EP Charges, as enemies later in the game have the ability to drain your EP.\n\nGrinding is not really a big part of the game, but I would certainly recommend it. When in a new area where the monsters are challenging and yield a good amount of XP or Sepith, I suggest you stay and fight them until you level up a few times. This is just to make sure that future boss battles are a ittle less of a kick in the pants.\n\nThere are plenty of monsters in the game (not to mention a bestiary) and there's a good variety as well. There are also lots of items in the game, and some items are only attainable from certain areas, so make sure you look through an area loot up treasure chests!\n\nThe boss monsters in the game are very well done! They are punishing, but not impossiblely difficult. There is ONE boss that I can think of that is pretty hard (not going to spoil it) but if you think about it, you'll know what to do when you come to it.\n\nThe soundtrack is also very well done and it's unique to the game.\n\nTHAT FINAL BOSS THEME THOUGH!\n\nLastly, the final boss. The final boss is very, very difficult. Perhaps the most difficult final boss I've ever faced in any JRPG I've ever played. The only final boss in another game I can think of that measures up to it is Corvus from Dragon Quest IX: Sentinels of the Starry Skies. I died many times facing both if those bosses, so you can kind of understand where I'm coming from now.\n\nThere's my review for one of the BEST JRPGs I have ever played. I highly recommend that you pick this title up, it is more than worth it!","May 3, 2015","true","49.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

But I felt compelled to expound on how much I enjoyed this one.\n\nThe Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky is a great old-school JRPG with a well crafted world and characters that you'll come to know well, and hopefully enjoy as much as I did. The settings are bucolic, quaint and completely charming. The sky is always blue and your heroes are likeable, funny, and surprisingly realistic. It's just all so wholesome and fun. I ran through sixty hours of game time in about a week because I couldn't put this down.\n\nIf you're a veteran of JRPGs, this will be very familiar territory. It's all a bit cliche, but the world building and story are so very well done that it's still enjoyable. Be warned that at least half of the game is simply spent reading dialog. Gameplay wise there isn't much to this. It's pretty basic JRPG style battles. The battle system is good though. I didn't feel like I had to grind to keep up. Enemies can sometimes be avoided when you just want to get on with it. There isn't anything revolutionary about the battles. I never found anything particularly challenging, but that wasn't what I was here for either.\n\nIt was the charming characters and storyline that kept me coming back. There is always just enough foreshadowing to keep you hooked to see what happens next, even though you've probably guessed exactly what it will be. Going through the motions is still fun. I kept waiting for that moment, as there are in so many JRPGs, when the story would go from making sense to suddenly everything is wacky sci-fi-fantasy-weirdness. There are twists and turns, and of course heightened stakes, but things never go completely out of this world. It stays pretty grounded for the most part.\n\nIf you're looking for just gameplay and action or difficult fights, you might find this a bit weak. But if you want a really well crafted world, fun characters and some solid enough JRPG fights to tie it all together check this out. I know this sounds like super high praise, but the closest thing I can think of to compare this to is Chrono Trigger. And it compares really favorably.\n\nI'll avoid spoilers, but will just say that I'm eagerly anticipating the sequel, which allegedly has been long promised, but is finally due for release in Summer 2015. Hope more people become aware of this little gem, and pick both it and the sequel up so that XSeed keeps releasing this series on Steam.","July 6, 2015","true","53.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Some had me lol'ing quite a few times, especially the banter between Estelle and Joshua.\n▪ Nice graphics. The backgrounds are well done and the monster design is interesting.\n▪ The story gets off to a bit of a slow start but it picks up a little once you reach the second town.(Bose)\n▪ The gameplay is pretty cool, you can customize different abilities into slots that you can unlock as you play.\n▪ The challenge feels pretty good, it's not too hard or too easy and the turn based battle system is implemented well and      is fun if not entirely innovative.\n▪ In 17 hours I only had one technical issue and that was loading a battle, it took about 30 seconds to load so I actually didn't have to close the game down.\n▪ Things I miss from this game that other RPG games have are items hidden in barrels, drawers, crates etc....there just aren't any, so don't expect to find a potion in Granny's panty drawer. (Not sure if you'd want to though to be honest)\nHowever there are some sparsely scattered chests throughout the maps and dungeons you travel.\nAlso there's not a lot of interactivity with background objects either, some kind of history or little nuance when you click certain items would have been a nice touch. (Although ... if you try and loot a chest you've already opened....) .. but overall this is a small gripe.\n\nAll in all It's a solid JRPG worthy of your collection.\n-FG","October 18, 2015","true","17.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ddoepic/recommended/251150/","ddoepic","Banesword","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ddoepic/","51 products in account","This is the first RPG I have played where the combat never has those stupid What the heck just happened I missed 5 times in a row and then got crit to death?!?!?! moments. (it has happened to me in some games) Each turn has specific turn bonuses, (anything from standard crits to healing and strenght boosts) and if you play correctly, you can steal them from your enemies with a special attack (I forget what they are actually called) that allows a character to attack the next turn instead of the person who would normally take that turn, or a skill that has a short cooldown/cast time. Used correctly, they can make boss fights much easier, but still worthy of the name BOSS. The story is also well done, and it always left me wanting to know what would happen next. It did become a bit of a grind in the last zone for me, (a huge maze that you can quickly loose yourself in) and it took me a few months before I decided to finish it, but I now regret not finishing it sooner. It has great world design, and even though the graphics aren't the best, they could draw out some beautiful scenery.\n\nI have played many different RPG's, and this was one of the best. 9/10\n\nThe reason it isn't 10/10 is because their is almost no loot. Money is mainly earned from questing, and all gear is either purchased or found in chests. I am someone who would much rather get great items from killing enemies than grinding to buy something at the store. Now that I think about it, though, this may have been done for world building reasons.\n\nGoing back to combat, the skill system in this game was unlike any other I had seen. Each character has a device called an Orbment, and by inserting special gems (quartz) into them, their element changes and grants the character new skills. Systems like this may have been used in other games, but this is the first one I've played that has used it. I realize I gave my rating above, and it is usually done last, but I am too lazy to move it.","September 6, 2015","true","61.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Recommended for both kids and adults. As an adult, I was delighted by the absence of contrivances in both the plot and the quests; the game feels fresh--at times it seems to revel in it. A kid might benefit from seeing the utter normality of the game world--you talk to random people and hear a couple of lines about their problems; for example, a man talks about how much he loves fishing, and his wife complains about how her husband is never home; or a dock worker says that his boss is tough but fair, meanwhile the boss is stressed about some problem running the docks. It all feel very normal, as if you're a child systematically being shown: this is how people deal with the world. The protagonists are modest to a fault (one of the game's characters even chides them for it), but I suppose there are worse examples to set.","November 11, 2015","true","203.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

There were pacing issues throughout, and I wasn't always certain if/when I should explore each tower in a region, resulting in me missing one of the towers. :-/\n\nI really enjoyed the character development and the story, but I grew to hate having to scour a town upwards of 7 times just to hear unique dialog from a random townsperson.

The orbament system for the combat is amazing i can set up any character to be the way i want them to be to do different roles ontop of their already unique setup.\nOrbament system: sure there have been other games to use this and im very sure it may remind people of FF7 materia but its different in a good way, each orbament can synergize and if u do it right you can get amazingly powerful skills. its great because you can find them or just make them yourself with Septium shards which is a great way to let your characters progress.\nCooking: master chef over here likes cooking everything and you know you can do that cooking is rewarding and you can save a lot of money in the game by just cooking foods.\nChests: i always make jokes about chests after looting them, why is it that our heroes in these RPGS always loot everything, poor chests are just doing a job protecting what was put in them just for our heroes to take them, now they respond with comments and jokes, atleast they arent being mean about it.\nStory: story is great the pacing is nice but it is a little slow at the start , you fall in  love with the characters though they are great and its the character progression thats really nice within the story.\nQuests!: your quests in the bracer guild are nice the board and the timers to do it make it actually seem that someone needs your help and theres a timer ( where we can assume a different bracer took the job if you dont do it) that when its over you cant do it anymore, the mainstory quest is great but these side quests feel rewarding too.\n\nim sure its sequels are coming out eventually and to my dismay it wont be fast enough but either way amazing\nIn general a game i recommend to anyone who likes rpgs or jrpgs 15/10 .\n\nsome slight bugs with chests for the achievement( i did a full run with guides to get every chest and i was still missing two by the end , this may be a case of chests repeating previous quotes and not giving new ones if you are unlucky)","January 18, 2015","true","98.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I was a big fan of JRPG's back when I was a kid playing Super Nintendo and JRPG's were basically the only rpg's you could play on console. The story starts off slow as you do small tasks for a group called the Bracers. The Bracers are like the cops of the world, going around protecting people, killing monsters and performing all types of tasks to make the world a better place. The problem I have with JRPG's now uh day's is that they are usually too kiddie and cute for my 31 year old brain to handle and I was worried that this game would be no different considering that the two characters you play as are 16 years old but the story is pretty good and does have more adult oriented things going on that satisfy my need for a mature themed story. The combat is good and I like the inclusion of orbments in the game because they remind me of the matreia system in Final Fantasy 7.\n\nI was having trouble with the game crashing a lot when I first started playing which really was ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off so I was saving every 2 minuets but there have been a few updates since and I have had no problems with crashing at all since then. So now I can definitely recommend this game to anyone into JRPG's for sure. I may come back with more thoughts after I complete the game but for now I will leave my review as is.","July 31, 2014","true","19.1"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The second part is annonced for End of 2014.\n\nThis game is fun, if you like (easy) tactic JRPG\n\nI started it, and I couldn't stop playing it for 7 hours. After seven hours, I barely made it through the prelude. The fighting system is a light version of some tactical Atlus games like Chaos Wars, and the magic system has a little bit from FF7 Materia system, except that you insert the "Quartz" into your character.\n\nThe story so far is lighthearted, guild mission based, almost like Atelier Iris, except that you have to wander through a "real" land, without a timelimit.\n\nThis is a real JRPG, a translation from the PS3 and Vita. These game were normaly not translated.  And the developer almost gave up, would they have not translated Y's for Steam.\n\nThe downside, however are bugs. I had to deactivate the highdefinition fonts, due crashes in the menues. After deactivating them, the game runs very stable.\n\nI can recommend this game, because I started to search this morning for more games of this serie.

I'm not really sure what I was expecting when I pick this up, I've always had a thing for aviation and fantasy airships in particular so I guess the title just resonated with me. It's not what I was hoping for, but it's not like I dislike it either.\n\nOkay let me start by saying that if you're hoping for combat with any kind of significant depth you can slow your roll right now, this games combat isn't very challenging or fun. I get the feeling it's aimed at a younger crowd, so they simplified or removed the kind of options you'd expect from this kind of turn based combat, unfortunately in doing so they basically made it so that the only tactic is "hit them faster and harder than they hit you" which essentially amounts to spamming the attack option with the occasional skill or magic thrown in to deal with status effect enemies or bosses, and only because they're irritating not because they're a significant threat.\n\nIf you're still reading this then there's still a chance you might like this game. As I said earlier, it's very cute. The stories pretty simple, the character designs are "soft" for lack of a better term, including the monsters and they have those always-sunny personalities you'd normally expect from an anime... actually just think of this as playing an anime, there's a manga and anime adaptation of it out and I'm not sure which came first. If the game did then it definitely adopts a bunch of tropes from the genre. The two main protagonists are young adventurers (probably early to mid teens, can't really remember) and as a result most of the side quests you end up doing are fairly small, like helping someone find a lost cat or helping out at a farm. While this may sound boring it's actually the bit of this game I look back on with the most fondness, there's something endearing about the characters and atmosphere so watching them interact naturally without trying to be serious was fun. In fact I'd go so far as to say that the stories really the only reason one would want to play this, it may be fairly simple but it's pretty long and the characters are likeable enough to carry it through despite the lacklustre combat.\nThere are several sequences through the game that are rather small but I really enjoyed that involved investigating a crime. Basically you happen upon the various scenes and have to look for clues to piece together what happened. Not all of them are made obvious to you and you have to put in a bit of thought to connect the dots. I almost wish the entire game had been designed with this in mind over combat, finding all the clues and piecing the evidence together felt much more rewarding than any combat encounter had.\n\nThe Tl;Dr is that even if it wasn't the most fun or exciting game I've played it was an enjoyable experience. The combat's boring as sin but the characters and a few interesting features are enough to keep you going assuming you don't mind anime-esque or cutesy stuff. It's the gaming equivalent of that contented feeling you get when you're curled up with a good book and a warm drink.","February 8, 2015","true","25.2"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

It sat in my backlog far longer than it should have, and perhaps my expectations got unfairly bloated with hype, but for whatever reason I can't fully recommend this title. I stress that it is in no way a bad game, but when it comes to JRPGs and the investments they require, there are better contenders out there more worthy of your time and money - two things many of us do not have in abundance.\n\nCuriously, Trails is made up of a lot of great parts, though they all seem to have caveats. The characters are fun, if clichéd, the writing is lively, but there is far too much of it, the combat has some really neat ideas, but ultimately feels slow and repetetive before the end. One thing I can unconditionally sing the praises of is the fantastic music, which I never tired of.\n\nI loved seeing convetional JRPG storylines, that often feel a little melodramatic, bucked for Trails' episodic, 'villain of the week' stories full of grounded drama and reasonable threat. I also really dug how the game naturally curbs its difficulty after a crushing defeat. If it wasn't for this smart offset I probably wouldn't have finished Trails as by the time I reached the final (difficult) dungeon I was spent, and not looking to give the game too much more of my time. That would have been a shame, as the eleventh hour twists and final cliffhanger were impactful and well written, and made the forty hours it took to get there almost worth it. For all the tropes it shook and the JRPG mechanics it defies, Trails suffers from poor pacing more than anything.\n\nA game needs to respect a players time, especially in an age where our Steam libraries are no doubt bursting with hauls from Humble Bundles and Summer Sales. Our cup runneth over, and this leads to Trails in the Sky's biggest downfall. It doesn't respect a players time, it unneccesarily pads out what could have been a tight, engaging twenty hour experience into a much longer slog full of less-than-stellar content.\n\nI enjoyed a lot of Trails in the Sky, but ultimately there are better things out there to spend 45 hours on - and I wish I had.","January 26","false","43.4"," 9 of 21 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","9","21","0","1"

The combat is pretty tedious due to the long animations, and more often than not you will just resort to letting the dimwitted AI pile into an AoE spell you set up in front of your characters.\n\nDespite the dialogue sometimes being genuinely funny and intriguing, the plot and main/minor characters are terribly cliche. The side characters in particular are boring archetypes vomitting out tired lines from any generic B-list anime you could think of.\n\nUnless you can find some way to get invested in the stagnant puddle deep plot, Trails is a complete and utter slog of a game.","April 28","false","28.1"," 5 of 13 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","5","13","0","0"

I’ve heard nothing but good things about the game and that its one of the finest examples of a JRPG. I haven’t touched it in some time, and while I had some fun playing it, glancing at it again in my Steam installed library made me realize that I have absolutely no desire to go back to it.\n\nOne major reason is the writing. The game is quite text heavy, but I actually enjoy wordy games if they’re well written. (I love the ♥♥♥♥ out of Planescape, Longest Journey, and Shadowrun HK for example) Trails does have a lot of attention to detail and it has its charm because of that, chests will always say something if you inspect them twice and townspeople will change their dialogue after pretty much each plot flag. The problem comes in that while Trails has a lot of dialogue it does nothing interesting with it. The main cast are all just bland anime clichés and the mountains of text do nothing to change them away from this. Like it’s cool that the protagonist, Estelle, is a girl, but she’s straight up your bog standard dumbass meathead shonen hero with the only difference being she’s not a dude. The game is glacially slow and while I don’t mind slow paced games at all, they need some hook to keep me going. All Trails had was just more stock anime shenanigans and really sloggy, grindy combat which is the biggest reason why I don’t want to go back to it.\n\nI’m mindful of how old the game actually is, but even that’s no excuse. Shadow Hearts Covenant came out the same year and it blows Trails completely out of the water in practically every way. Ultimately Trails is a really mediocre game. There are much more interesting RPGs you could be playing instead on Steam such as LISA, Witcher 3, and Undertale.","April 28","false","7.1"," 4 of 11 people (36%) found this review helpful","36","4","11","0","4"

I could forgive many of its flaws if it wasn't so BOOOOORING to play. It has literally put me to sleep five or six times.\n\nPROS:\n- The dated environments aren't completely terrible.\n- Some people may like the blurry sprite character models with no mouths.\n- Step brother & sister romance\n\nCONS:\n- Combat\n- Endless text\n- Step brother & sister romance (sorry, I don't know how this got placed under pros, obviously belongs here)\n- Music\n- Combat\n- Story\n- Magic system\n- COMBAT\n\nThe fighting is turn-based but nothing potentially strategic or cool works very well. It's also mind-numbingly boring.\n\nYou have magic but it's a blatant rip-off of FF VII's materia system, where you put round colored things into your hoo-hoo dilly and gain powers. The original spin LoH put on it is to make those magic powers practically useless. You cannot cast any spells on the same turn and none of them seem to do much good anyway.\n\nAs for the physical combat, it's annoying b/c each character can only move a certain number of spots per turn and hitting (or being hit) will cause targets to move. So you might have an enemy which can be killed in two hits and two of your characters are in range. Perfect, right? Not so much. One of them hits the enemy and, sadly, knocks it out of range of your other character which causes you to waste their turn moving toward the enemy while allowing the enemy to pull off an attack they otherwise wouldn't have.\n\nOr both of your characters simply MISS. Which happens. A lot. Missing is an integral part of this game, not just against strong enemies but even trash mobs. That's right, the same flying cats with bells you encounter in the very beginning will often taunt you as three characters in a row just miss them. Even when you don't whiff while trying to hit the trash, they still take an inordinate amount of turns to kill, including when you are vastly over-leveled and geared up.\n\nI should mention that you can buy materia, er-"orbments"! Sorry, orbments, which can decrease your casting time and increase your accuracy. These don't seem to work especially well, either, and also it's complete BS to have to waste magic slots on things that simply help make combat bearable.\n\nSurviving combat essentially comes down to being over-leveled and geared up. This means grinding levels & money, which sucks because as I've outlined above, the combat is terrible. And even when you are stronger than the enemies, the battles will still not be fun and take way too long.\n\nWhat about the story? Glad you asked: it's as stupid and uninteresting as the combat. Also, the text dialogue never ends and you can't skip it. They explain everything, EV-RY THING, about five times. Even the most minor of plot points have painful amounts of exposition to the point where the characters might as well look directly at you and say, "I've been discussing in this conversation how my step sister is an incorrigible tom boy, which she gets from her father, and I am secretly in love with her."\n\nThe music is also pretty bad. Some of the town and overworld stuff is serviceable, but the battle music is cringe-worthy. This is especially true for the random battle music, which makes me laugh every time I hear it. I suppose that could be considered a plus.\n\nTL;DR\nThis is one of those games that's so boring it makes me stare at the wall and think about all the other ways I could be spending my time. As JRPG gamers, thoughtful introspection like this must be avoided at all cost since it could lead to exercise and social interaction. Avoid this game and play Kingdom Hearts again b/c Kyrie is hotter than the girls in LoH and she's not Sora's sister.\n\n3/10 Would not step-sister again.","April 26","false","17.4"," 1 of 7 people (14%) found this review helpful","14","1","7","0","0"

It allows you to live through the very first parts of Falcom's *new* Legend of Heores universe that spans 4 countries and  a long interesting backstory which one slowly explores through the (so far) 7 games of the franchise.   In this title you play as Estelle who is journeying around the Liberal kingdom to first become a bracer when the plot thickens and she is then  involved in a big movment concerning her and her newfound friends family.   It's all typical JRPG fare of leveling and grinding, reading alot of text, and inputing commands to do battle.\n\nWe all know that part though, this is an old game which MANY sequel thus far, so how about we discuss the actual impression one gets whilst playing.\n\nTHIS GAME IS BORING\nMake no mistake in an any way about it, this game is the most boring JRPG you can imagine but you *have* to play through it to get alot of parts in Second Chapter, which is a very not boring game. The music is BORING, the characers are BORING, the dungeons are BORING, the skill system is BORING, the weapons are BORING.  If you want to play an exciting JRPG like Tales of or Wild Arms this is not for you at all.  It's just the primer to Legend of Heroes 6, 7, and 8.\n\nYou'd expect me to talk about how good the port is at this point, but too bad.  This isn't a port- this was always a PC game and it made its way to PSP and back again through the mixed up world of loclization.  That being said it's smooth and easy to customize to your liking and optimized very well also.\n\nThere's not too much else to say.  Get it if you want to exprience the first part of the new Legend of Heroes, but not if you want to have a blast.","December 25, 2014","true","2.5"," 0 of 5 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","5","0","0"

All enemies appear on screen ahead of time, most can be avoided, and some really difficult monster fights related to bracer guild requests will even warn you before you start the fight.\n\nThe Bad:\n- The pacing of the story can be awkward and there are many sections filled with text bubble after text bubble\n- Slow battle animations. My play time would be way less if this game didn't load just about everything slowly. Movement in battle, attacks in battle, the battle splash screen, the victory screen, going from room to room, the story...\n- Unskippable animations and dialogue. This really bogs the game down, particularly if you have to replay a section or choose to during New Game+.\n- Grinding. Even with choosing to fight every monster I could find I still had to go back and grind a few times. Having the item that makes you invisible so you can get suprise attacks helps speed it up but grinding is still a big problem.\n- A very weak idea of what a "tactical" RPG is. All of the fights are in square arenas. If the player surprises the enemy or starts the battle normally the enemy will always be on one side and the heroes on the other. If the player is surprised the heroes are surrounded. Users can't move and act in the same turn so the "tactics" become picking which enemy to target with arts/magic in order to hit the maximum amount of enemies.\n\n\nI played this game until the very end. Despite the gameplay flaws I was compelled to finish it. It just isn't compelling enough to recommend.","March 24, 2015","false","86.0"," 45 of 103 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","45","103","2","9"

The second part is around 30.  It's not even worth 10.  The visuals are nice, but the gameplay is just okay, what you would expect from a FF type RPG.  The dialogs are a little too long and the missions are not very clear from the get-go.  It doesn't feel too much of an open world but linear.  Also, the music is not great.  The world music is fine but the battle music is a little boring.\n\nI'm a hardcore RPG old school gamer, and I play the game, will do so until I finish it; I just don't recommend it for the price, no way, and don't go paying 30 USD for the Second Chapter (SC) part.  I hear this is a trilogy.  Wait for the price to drop to less than 10; if you really like it buy the 2nd and 3rd Chapters for less than 10, though.

The combat is pretty simple and the characters are derivative (it is literally a who's who of Stock Japanese Character Tropes) but the setting is pretty good and you can feel that the devs put a lot of love into it.\n\nBut then I did my research and I find out that the game was released back in 2004 and I was going to give it the benefit of the doubt.  Like I did the same thing with the John Carter movie where I initially dismissed it until I found out that it was based off of a book written a hundred years earlier.  That's not really fair.  We've come a long ways as far as story telling goes and you can't actually be accused of being derivative when you're the trope maker.\n\nBut then I was like, wait, the PS2 was already out by then.  We'd already figured out how to make good RPG's.  Look back at what else was released in 2004: KOTOR 2, Vampire Bloodlines, Digital Devil Saga, Phantom Brave, Paper Mario: 1000yrDoor, Suikoden 4...  Those are some good ♥♥♥ games except for Suikoden 4, which was solidly mediocre but still better than Legend of Heroes.\n\nSo, armed with the proper perspective with which to judge this game, I can calmly and confidently Not Recommend it.\nUnless you really want to play a game ridden with horrible japanese tropes and cliches.","April 6","false","17.5"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","1"

It felt like there was so much more to explore, see, and learn of this world and so many deep things. I just don't see what all the excitement and love is over this game is, I won't say its the worst rpg I have played but its not going to be one of my favorites for sure....\n\nI guess I expected this game to grow more and do more than it did, but in the end it didn't. Perhaps the purpose was just to set up for the second chapter which I have yet to play. But I guess as a fan of rpg's I just found the game small and lacking in the end... I guess I felt cheated by the tiny world as your limited to moving around in one tiny kingdom, and a world filled with so much wonder and mystery you never really get to get deep enough into.. the whole game kinda felt like a tease to me......","February 27","false","61.4"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

It isn't.  If you want a great, modern JRPG, pick up Persona 3 or 4 if the biggest draw for you is the story, Dragon Quest IX or Bravely Default if you're in it for the combat.  This game doesn't come close in either category.\n\nThe tactical rpg-lite combat misses the point of tactical combat systems.  Being forced to sacrifice a turn in order to control the location of your character beyond hoping that the attack command places you on a strategically beneficial tile makes the positioning element of combat meaningless.  Instead, the only thing gained by the movement grid in battle is that occasionally you won't be able to move far enough to attack an enemy on your turn which limits your choices to either using magic or moving as close as you can to the enemy you want to attack.  Well, that and battles take thrice as long as they should.\n\nThe story is typical jprg fare, but everything that could be said in one or two lines of dialogue is said in 20.  Two kids set out to become adventurers.  It's the same two kids you've been playing as in every mediocre jrpg with generic characters released in the past two decades.  I played long enough to add two additional characters to my party.  They're even worse and manage to bring a bit of sexism and homophobia to the game's excruciatingly long dialogue sequences.  Yay.\n\nI've read a lot of reviews praising the game for how it fleshes out stories for every single character in the game.  It sounded good on paper, but imagine trying to feign interest while a co-worker tells you about the ongoing battle with their eight year old daughter's soccer coach who refuses to put her on the field as often your co-worker thinks she should be.  That's the kind of story you'll be hearing from the game's NPCs.  Sure, there's story there, but it has almost nothing to do with you.  And even if you do find that level of conversation interesting, it's still told with at least twice as much dialogue as is even remotely necessary.\n\nI'm pretty disappointed that I bought into the hype and picked this one up.  It was a debate between this and picking up one of the Dragon Quest games I missed over the years (V).  I made a terrible mistake.","March 21","false","11.1"," 2 of 12 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","2","12","0","0"

Every single chapter follows the same formula.\n\n-Explore region\n-Meet new person\n-Bad guy does bad thing to that person\n-Chase bad guy\n-Defeat bad guy\n-Bad guy escapes, only to get captured by someone else in the next scene\n-Leave region\n\nThat in itself is annoying enough, but the characters filling that formula are just the worst kind of stereotypical everything you can imagine. The fiery girl who is all about fighting but isn't very observant or introspective. Her stoic and mysterious brother who is super smart and level-headed and knows just what to say at all the right times. The older woman (who is 26) who drinks too much and solves her problems by whipping and intimidating them. The bisexual effeminite man who hits on everything. The super angry guy who solves everything by hitting it and is an abusive jerk to everyone he meets but for some reason everyone just puts up with it because he's good at hitting things.\n\nAnd on.\n\nAnd on.\n\nSo, like I said at the start, if you have a high tolerance for that sort of thing then by all means.

Unfortunately, several flaws have driven me to a negative review:\n* Clunky, ultra-repetitive combat system\n* Very poor PC / monster power pacing - combat ranges from the trivially easy (opten "quest bosses") to the impossible (wandering monsters, for some reason). I repeatedly found myself having to run away from every wandering monster I saw only to find out that the boss of the very same quest wasn't even a challenge. My character power, meanwhile, never seemed to go up to any significant degree, even though the monsters got stronger - eventually I hit a wall where a specific plot quest encounter was literally impossible and decided I wasn't about to backfarm for hours just to get past it.\n* Frustrating movement - it's not too bad if you're using the mouse, but if you're a keyboard mover like me, it's quite frustrating.\n\nIf you're willing to look past these things - and willing to spend a lot of time grinding away at mobs just to level up - I'm sure you'll like this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DivineMercy/recommended/251150/","DivineMercy","Anachronicistic Cataclasm","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DivineMercy/","96 products in account","I'll post the tl;dr right at the top, this might be lengthy.\n\ntl;dr: If you have the mindset and intelligence of a 12 year old with 8 year old humor then you will absolutely love this game. Let's put it this way, if you remember playing games like Dragon Quest as a kid, loved them, and then played this you would get a nice feeling of nostalgia followed by pure boredom and realization of how mediocre this game really is.\n\nNow that that is out of the way, and although I REALLY, and I mean REALLY wanted this game for a long time (over a year, was waiting for a nice sale) I would love to recommend this game but I just can't. Hear me out on this I tried to like this game, and there are several aspects of this game I do thoroughly enjoy and find innovative. Please keep in mind that I spent a long time coming up with this decision and thought it through the whole time I was playing this game, these are opinions and are subject to vary from person to person. Seeing as how this game got such a high rating on Steam I couldn't resist to get this game. Honestly, the high rating is extremely exaggerated and is not a 92/100 (in terms of 92% of people recommend it) by any means.\n\nPros:\nInnovative gear system (orbments, augmentation essentially) - I haven't played any games (if I can recall correctly) that use this system. Essentially you can 'augment' what they call "quartz" onto your party members and they each have their own buffs/boons but they can also build up to unlock extra 'art' moves ('arts' are their form of saying spells). Sadly, they take about two full turns to cast, one to set up and one to actually cast it.\nExtremely innovative combat mechanics - I was surprised with how they handled what happens when your party wipes. Most games just have a load previous save thing or retry and thats about it. Even though this game has this too, the 'retry' option actually nerfs the enemies you face (this can be seen as a con too for those who look for difficulty or strategic ways of winning) over time. Say in the first case you face an enemy and get instantly wiped out, the next time you attempt to face them the battle order may have changed (maybe your teammates go first to get a chance to do something before they do), you may get those special buffs that are so critical to a kill or win (I will explain that next), the enemies' damage is reduced and so is their defence and in the end just makes it so you can get by the battle. Every subsequent 'wipe' results in another nerf on the enemy.\nCombat buffs - During the combat phases you can see the enemy/friendly order on the left hand side of the screen and you may see those buffs and who gets them. This buff system is very helpful in dire situations and can determine life or death, easily. Whether it's HP Heal, CP Gain, Str Up, or Critical, etc. they always help your party, or your enemy. It is always fun trying to set the enemy back to lose their buff so your party gets it instead, especially when it's something you're looking for.\nMusic- This is self explanatory but the soundtrack for the game is very engaging and relaxing, it does a very good job of putting you in the mood of the story or whatever sequence is going on. Put simply, they nailed the music to match the atmosphere.\nNow on to the 'neither pro or con' section:\nMain Story - Seeing as how most JRPGs go, this storyline they have is not awful but its not good either. You start out as Estelle Bright and aspire (with your 'brother' Joshua) to become senior bracers and be as tough as your father, recognized and respectable. Along the way you uncover conspiracies and corruption and your job as a bracer is to stop such 'evil' in the world, for example stopping the Sky Bandits from ransoming innocent civilians and grand theft of an airliner, stopping thieves from stealing precious gems, solving mysteries of arson, thefts, burglaries, etc..\nSide Quests - Most games make side quests that have either little or no character interaction, progression or reason behind it. In this game the side quests seem very put in place to help you progress and buy more upgrades or ingredients, etc. your party may need. Moreover, another reason they have side quests is to level up (at least most of the time) as you'll find your party under-leveled often if you don't do them or just pursue the main story. However, these quests actually do have cutscenes and dialogue, and character progression which is very nice to see developers put lots of time into even the side quests; I haven't seen this done much in almost any game. One irritating point about side quests is that they expire if you progress a little too far in the story. This sucks if you forget about side quests, not really a gripe though, it's expected.\nCons:\nDialogue/Cutscenes - This game has awful, absolutely awful dialogues and cutscenes. Even though almost everything is voiced over the dialogue, (they have some parts that are pure text) it is as if the writers are 10 years old. Their humor is the most laughable thing ever and is the last thing from funny. I suppose if you're 8 you would actually laugh and find most of the humor funny, other than that it's laughably pathetic. This wasn't a con to me but this game has a LOT of talking in it, so if dialogue is a turn off for a game then avoid this game. The animations themselves in the cutscenes seem so forced and unsmooth it's awkward at times. It's like watching a poorly animated school project video made for art class at times; for example, seeing an airliner move frame by frame and seemingly float in the air, completely out of place. I understand this game is a port and somewhat old, but other games from this time had better animations than this.\nCharacters - You may think this is a weird con but let me explain. This is one of the worst aspects of the games, absolute worst. Before I make any statements on it, think back to when you were 13 years old and had 'great' ideas for video games that were RPGs and thought of these great characters, that's how these writers were. Take any Schwarzenegger film and you can apply the characters to his movies. Estelle is a complete dumbass, and is clear through the dialogue that she is as smart as a 6 year old or at least is severely mentally ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at the age of 16; however, she inherents the skill of using a stave like from her father. Estelle will irritate you beyond belief with her stupidity, the writers just try too hard to create comedic effect with this stupidity, mind you. Furthermore, she cannot pick up on innuendos, at all, like any other 6 year old kid. Remember that one kid in your class that you wish would just shut the ♥♥♥♥ up and if they didn't you would freak out? That's Estelle in a nutshell. Her character is shallow and easily predictable, like every other character in the game. Moving on to Joshua, he's not nearly as bad; however, he is just as predictable. He comes off as a secretive and depressed kid, or at least traumatized as a child (which he is). He is smart (in terms of this game at least, considering everybody has the logic and thought process of a 10 year old) and quick-witted and can decipher a crime scene with ease and pick up on trends or piece things together like any normal adult. He has his moments of depression that generally goes into a romantic cutscene with Estelle, with a kidish twist of silly humor and 'cheer me up' laughs and giggles. These 'Bracers' are 16, not 12 and going through puberty like middle school kids; however, that's how their romance progresses and is actually cringe-worthy if you think about this enough. Those are the two main characters that actually matter.\nI have no more space to write and finish this review, but either way I rate this 5/10.","January 13","false","31.7"," 4 of 17 people (24%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","24","4","17","2","3"

And they're mostly right; the things this game does well, it does EXTREMELY well.  The sound and art design are excellent.  Unfortunately, it doesn't have it where it counts: the gameplay.\n\nBattles occur on a tiled field with you at one end and enemies at the other, and you converge to do battle over each individual unit's turn, which can be irregularly spaced depending on the number of units and their relative stats.  That's all well and good, but the game also insists on implementing a randomized bonus system, where on certain turns, whoever is currently acting gets a free boost, be it bonus damage or free healing.  The problem is, there's only one way for the player to influence who gets these bonuses, and it's situational at best.  On Normal difficulty, this is probably permissible, but I went straight to Hard (and there's another one above that) and the game balance just wasn't there.\n\nOn top of that, there are certain enemies who can just straight up kill you on their own -- and these are random encounter enemies.  Healing items are too expensive to rely on and healing spells take too long to use (this can be mitigated later, but it's still a significant problem).  Couple that with a clunky upgrade system, always having too few party members to handle a situation, and an obtuse mission system, and I find that I don't have any compelling reason to play it anymore.  I forced myself to pick this game up again after putting it down multiple times, but ultimately, I can't finish it, and it's one of a handful of purchases I actually regret.

These are just a few of the complaints I noted while playing The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky.\n\nThe game feels like a B anime show, with mountains of unnecessary dialogue and attempts at humor that never really hit the mark. Character development feels very forced, and usually devolves to one character listing off their personality traits in a conversation.\n\nMost of your time with the game will be spent moving from town to town, solving problems that have only a passing link to the primary conflict. The storyline quests that the characters pursue have little to no bearing on the actual plot. In short, the game is mostly filler material, with plot development only occuring in the first and last few hours.\n\nThe combat system isn't bad, but does drag on in certain fights. Animations can't be skipped in any way, so when battling groups of enemies the fights tend to drag on. The monsters you will encounter have no coherency with the locales of the world, and aren't threatening in the slightest. Most of the game is spent fighting squirrels, sheep, and bugs. The game's inhabitants are terrified of these creatures.\n\nIf you're a big fan of JRPG tropes, stereotypes, and story beats, this might be what you're looking for.

It is also way to easy.","January 8","false","45.0"," 2 of 13 people (15%) found this review helpful","15","2","13","0","0"

It really does ask you to play the next chapter to get any real story out of this.\n\nCombat is repetitive and can randomly fluctuate between extremely difficult to insultingly easy.\n\nWalls of text can make it hard to keep you interested in the comings and goings of this world. You spend more time reading about random character nonsense than anything that can actually matter to this story.\n\nIt takes a good 30 hours before any of the storyline really begins and starts to look interesting. It has one of the slowest starts of any JRPG I have ever played and I played a lot of them.\n\nCharacters can get a bit grating on your nerves since they never seem to stop talking.\n\nThe gameplay has you go from town to town randomly wandering into trouble and saving everything. It gets old fast.\n\nThis is not a game for anyone who is not okay with a very slow RPG. Even when it ramps up to faster speeds with the storyline, talking and wandering around is still slow. And the game never even really finishes.\n\n3/10 overall.","January 2","false","61.9"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","9","1","11","0","0"

I got all the chapters  of the Carnelia Books.  I try to turn them in the coffee house and he just blabs nonsense.  It is so frustrating when you spend so much time finding books to run into bugs like this.  So many things are missable too.","March 15","false","85.5"," 1 of 11 people (9%) found this review helpful","9","1","11","0","0"
