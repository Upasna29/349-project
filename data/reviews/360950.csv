I will change my review when that happens.\n\nBut I can't, in good conscience, encourage people to buy this game because it has almost zero content.

I bought, installed, and played a few matches of the game, wondering what these boys had prepared for the next generation of Gamers. But after playing a few matches, I uninstalled the game and allowed it to collect dust within my collection.\n\nMy reason? I wanted to wait.\n\nI wanted to wait for this game to become the game I hoped it would be. I wanted it to become something this new generation of gamers could pick up and enjoy, much like my early years of childhood gaming were. I wanted it to become something to revolutionize and shake the gaming world, much like Descent did when I was given a 3 dimensional world to explore and 6 degrees of freedom. And so, I uninstalled it and ignored ANY news about it.\n\n2 months have passed since that night, and I decided to give this game a second run. Just to see how our Dev boys are doing. I installed it and I could already feel worry building. What would I find? What improvements had come about in my 2 month absence? What new and exciting things had been added?\n\nI had seen a few things people had replied on my previous review so I had SOME idea what to expect. But I wasn't ready.\n\nLoading up the game was much like it was before. I waited until my PC loaded up the game and prepared myself. But nothing could prepare me.\n\nWhen the game launched, I caught glimpse of that beautiful vessel from yesterdecade. The Pyro GX, now redesigned and renamed "The Torch", made every sense of nostalgia in my body go wild. Memories of flying through various mines alongside my older brother and dad came rushing back after seeing it spinning like a new car on a turn table. I knew I had to play. Screw being tired, it was time to fly. I loaded up the Torch and took her for a spin in multiplayer.\n\nDEAR. LORD. IN. HEAVEN.\n\nHOW LONG HAS THIS ITCH BEEN IN ME THAT I NEVER KNEW IT NEEDED TO BE SCRATCHED?! I never realized how difficult it was to track a target in a full 3 dimensional, Zero G enviorment. I forgot that I had to remember what it FELT like to fly around with a mini armory strapped to my back. I HAD TO REMEMBER HOW TO FLY USING THREE DIRECTIONS!!\n\nAs for a review, here you go:\n\nIt's not done.\n\nThe game is no where NEAR done yet. There are still more ships to add, more weapons to test, and possible new things to add to the game that the Dev boys have yet to think up or unveil. I'm not even sure if there are afterburners yet. But I only played one match and didn't look up the controls. I needed to fly the Torch, I can look up controls later.\n\nBut what is there is SOLID NOW.\n\nThe variation in ships is a great expansion of what was tried back in Descent 3, and I like the fact that the Devs are working on skins for the ships, giving a bit of variation in looks, but keeping the ships unique.\n\nThe gameplay I experienced was a blend of close quarters shoot outs and large room gun fights, each displaying the vast difference between being shotgun close to your opponent, and across the room dodgeball.\n\nThe weapons FELT like they did in previous games, making me instantly remember how to fly and shoot. Althought my aim could use some vast improvements.... That's on me tho.\n\nThe LOOK of it was EASILY up there with games of present day, giving it that shiny new car look and feel, but keeping the 6DOF gameplay I loved as a child.\n\nThe sounds were spot on, as well as the music. Can't wait to hear the full stuff. Also as a request to the Devs. Think we could get some more of that metal music like Descent 2 had? I can't find the song name but I think you guys will know what I'm talking about.\n\nResults: Even with this game being Early Access, I will DEFINATELY keep it installed this time. I don't think it's QUITE worth the $30 price tag right NOW, but if the Devs keep up the work like they have in the past 2 months, I could see the price being WELL worth it.\n\nKeep up the excellent progress gentlemen. Hope to see this on Xbox marketplace some day.","January 15","true","0.7"," 35 of 41 people (85%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","85","35","41","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CosmicD/recommended/360950/","CosmicD","CosmicD","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CosmicD/","274 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDescent! It takes me back 20 years. I actually never played the complete first game but the shareware edition (with one section of the single player campaign). I remember how a game magazine of that time made me completely wild for descent 2, I bought that game and was immediately soaked into the world of 360° movement,... with a keyboard! And the intriguing little story of the material defender who was constantly being framed and tricked by Dravis (on behalf of the PTMC mining corporation) to go from planet to planet to control a cybervirus outbreak that made all the mining robots go wild and hostile against everything.\n\nSome of the innovations of the game were tools such as "wingnut", your guidebot that would help shoot and iluminate your path in the dark mines, warned you for enemiesi etc.... Actually that game was very scary, especially in the darker levels where hostile big bots would jump on you from a corner and waste you buy doing kamikaze attacks. And the bigger bots would just look menacing.\n\nAfter descent 3 (in 1999), the franchise went dead. THere was a spinoff from volition software called descent: conflict freespace but except for a few similarities such as "it's a space sim" and "you fly a ship", there's nothing in common with the original Descent, it's not even in the same universe.\n\nNow, 15 years after descent 3 there's Descent underground. As an old gamer nut I jumped on the occasion immediately and bought into early access.\n\nThe makers from this game are a gathering of enthousiast, and ex cloud imperium (star citizen) employees who have bought the license from interplay and try to usher Descent into a modern game by making it more interesting, adding a fleshed out multiplayer to this new installment.\n\nYou and your ship used to be the bound together and that one ship was the only way to play. But now, there will be more ships to play witrh, each with their specializations. This will make it interesting for both multiplayer AND coop. Like the legacy descent games, this game offers you many upgrade capabilities for your ship weapons, but Underground will extend your utility and deployment possibilities beyond guidebot, to specific mining tools and even a laser grid which you can deploy. And I'm only talking about the early access version. Each ship will offer their unique power such as a spinning defense drone, a blast shield, and a mining laser that enables you to find cool secrets in the level.\n\nThe devs mean to plunge us into a great coop campaign but also many multiplayer modes such as deathmatch, teamdeath match types, and a spin on the capture the flag/domination type called Capture the core, where you have to mine the most out of a central object in a level.\n\nAbout the controls I can only say it the simplest way possible. It's descent 2015!. They work the new ut4 engine well. The team invited top-of-the-world descent veterans to make them realise the feel and behavior of the ships.\n\nThis enabled them to give us an authentic "Descent-y" ship maneuvering experience. Personally I never played the old games (descent 1/2) with a mouse so I can only talk from d³ experience. The movement behaviour in this game, while improving upon it. It's being turned into a viable multiplayer experience. The reason why that works is that you can change x and Y axis sensitivity and accelleration curves independedly. You can mold it to your own style and prefference but still within the boundaries of a true classic "descent ship" controlling experience which requires you to do quite some movement prediction and recalibration as you fly and shoot.\n\nIn multiplayer this becomes especially frantic as ships from the other team will ofcourse move defensively. That's how it becomes an experience on it's own and the passage of time and decisions made by the team will have to prove if it's aviable compeitive mode for professional leagues.\n\nBut as far as I can play the singleplayer/play against bot mode, the experience really seems authenticly "descent". Shoot open doors, get upgrades, navigate huge or narrow spaces. It's all very remeniscent but in a new modern jacket.\n\nThere's no information on the single player yet. I'll just end this review here and update it when I've got the chance to play the launch version. But as a descent fan, I'm really hooked.","October 31, 2015","true","20.4"," 18 of 21 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","18","21","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hejyhej/recommended/360950/","hejyhej","Hej","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hejyhej/","419 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI can't enjoy playing this game and, thus, cannot recommend it for three reasons:\n\n1. Input options for mouse aiming are really bad. Because ship stats influence ship turn speed its impossible to get a proper sensitivty set. Beyond that it is entirely faster to perform turns with a dedicated key rather than by using mouse movement. I have a dedicated button bound for yaw left/right and pitch up/down because it is impossible to turn as quickly using mouse movement. I think control schemes should be easy to understand and not require redundant binds. Beside that, rather than numeric inputs, sensitivity stuff is set with sliders.\n\nTo put this aiming issue into perspective: someone sneaks up on you from behind and starts blasting, in every other game I would swipe my mouse sideways and do a 180 and shoot them. In this game, rather than swiping the mouse, I am forced to press and hold a button because turning with a button is faster than using a mouse. After rotation is completed the mouse is used to fine aim.\n\n\n2. Setting key bindings is really bad. If you have a key being used for something and bind it to another action it tells you that the key is already in use but it doesn't tell you what it is in use for so you have to hunt through the whole config to find that bind. Also rather than setting a key to strafe left and strafe right you set two binds for strafe, one regular and one with a reverse checkbox. It is a bit odd.\n\nI found playing this game with a keyboard and mouse frustrating. It would probably be acceptable with a steam controller but that is not yet implemented.\n\n3. Lastly I would like to point to an issue with the EULA, it states:\n\n"You agree that you will not create, transfer, share, send, submit or upload any User Generated Content that: contains any statements or materials that disparage, ridicule or scorn DSI or any third party;"\n\nThe way I'm seeing this is that if I make a YouTube video addressing the concerns in this review it can be interpreted as disparaging or as ridicule or scorn and they could issue a copyright violation and my channel could get a copyright strike.","March 31","false","1.2"," 28 of 39 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","28","39","0","2"

Descent 2 was the first game I purchased with my own money (I think it was $50 back in 1996!) and beat without cheat codes.

While this game is in early access and there is not much to do, what is there seems fully functional. I have not hit a single bug. While it is not a remake, there are different ships and at least one weapon I do not remember, it is very similar to the original. It looks like it will become a worthy sequel.\n\nOn top of that, it is a beautiful game!

I have found it easy to pick up and play, highly enjoyable and generally a worthwhile investment of time. I've not sunk this much energy into a game for a considerable period.\n\nPoints of concern for people coming into the game, who may be new to early access, could be; The limited selection of levels and weapons. There is a reasonable amount for the stage of development that the game is in but people should be aware that it is early in the state of development and thus still hasn't got a full feature set.\n\nThere have been some issues with controls, particularly mouse. At time of writing, I can happily attest that my mouse is working and extremely comfortable, though the issue persists for others. Descendent Studios has been hugely active within the community in it's attempts to resolve this issue.\n\nThe game, though easy to pick up, can be unforgiving if you're new to it. Likewise if you are unsued to six degrees of freedom movement (6dof) or the fact that ships have specific physics to their turn rate/movement.\n\nAs a note; for those who have an interest in feedback/information on the development of the game, generally the amount of information and developer involvement with the community is quite high. I've yet to experience a situation where I've not felt like I know what is going on.\n\nI can happily recommend this game. It's an awful lot of good fun.

Solo content is currently limited to some basic bot fights (very bad/stupid bots if I may add). I'm not looking for another lazy-designed multiplayer oriented game. Might change later on, but for now, I really can't recommend this if you loved the solo part of original games. If you like multiplayer only games you may find it interesting now.\n\nAlso important to note that the game has already been basically given away while still in Early Access, which is definitely NOT a good sign for me. (was sold under $2 along with 5 other games on Indiegala)\n\nEdit since there's been some updates since my review: still absolutely nothing new for single player, just some random terrible bot-fights. And while I undestand "multiplayer is the focus" for now, I don't see it as a good sign for single player. A good level design (you can't just reuse the current maps clearly designed for multiplayer, original Descent locked doors in multiplayer would make little sense for example), storyline and balance is hard to create, it takes a really long time, and needs feedback and tweaks also for a long time. Not having anything even started on that point makes me fear for the final result.","January 7","false","4.8"," 30 of 44 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","30","44","0","3"

Grinding level 7 in Descent while trying to kill what seemed to me at the time as the hardest boss in all games until finally managed to master the trichording dodging of incoming homing plasma balls making the boss a walk in the park, developing a love-hate relationship with the Descent 2 helper bot that occasionally would "accidentaly" shoot a flare at my shields and so much more...\nI bought Descent 1 and 2 on steam and similar games like Sublevel Zero, Strike Suite Zero, Strike Suit Infinity, Miner Wars 2081, Evochron Mercenary, Warframe (the Archwing missions) and have on my wishlist Retrovirus and Project Nimbus. I bought all these games for less than 5 EUR while on sale and I bought this Descent Underground game for more than 20 EUR just to support the developers.\n\nThat being said: this game does NOT give the Descent feeling.\n\nI liked the original Descent games because they were hard, unforgiving at higher difficulty levels but they would also recognize and reward skill. With enough skill you would be able to defeat any odds, go against any number of enemies with starting laser and win without a scratch. This gave the feeling of being able to become invincible if you trained enough. The main reason for this was being able to dodge any attack: lasers, plasma, missiles, even homing missiles or energy weapons, you could also outmaneuver melee enemies. This was posible because bullets traveled slowly and ships moved fast. In this game however bullets and enemies travel faster than the ship can dodge so it is just a simple shooter, aim better and win, no dodging and planning, just shooting. So the feeling of invulnerable-if-skilled is gone...\n\nAnother reason for likeing the original Descent games was the feeling of Zero gravity which made the map feel more than flat, the walls and ceiling were also part of the map, somewhere you would go to hide, attack, walk through doors, etc. Essential in achieving this was that there was no difference between up-down and left-right movement. Moving on all axes was the same. In this have aiming left or right is much easier that aiming up or down which gives the feeling that the game and the map are actually flat instead of 3D. Also the game seems to autolevel to the floor again enforcing the feeling of "feet on the ground" kind of gameplay. So the Descent feeling is gone...\n\nI know this is just an Alpha build but if the developers released it like this it means that they don't understand what made the Descent series great.\n\nThis game has better than average graphics but that is not enough to be a great game and Descent series deserves a great game. Sublevel Zero is a game that nailed the Descent feeling. It doesnt have top notch realistic graphics but it does have the Descent soul. Therefore I believe that in order for this game to truly become one of the Descents, the developers should aim for at least two goals:\n1. Make almost any attack dodgeable, from lasers, missiles, plasmas etc including the homing attacks\n2. Make movement on all axes feel exactly the same: moving along the left-right axis should feel the same as up-down and as forward-back and moving along an axis should feel the same as rolling on all axes (same speed and same inertia)\nThese objectives may be achieved by:\n1. Lowering projectile speeds and enemy bots speeds\n2. Increasing player ship speeds AND response time. Currently the ships feel heavy and take a lot of time to change directions.\n3. Include trichording which seems to be missing\n4. Setting the up-down aim speed the same as left-right and setting the roll speed the same as aiming speed\n5. Remove autolevel or include an option to turn it off. If you can't play without autolevel then the Descent series and its potential is not for you.\n\nI wish the developers all the best and hope to see some improvements soon.\nSince the game does not have a single player yet I dare you to come meet me in the mines.","October 23, 2015","true","4.4"," 16 of 20 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","16","20","0","6"

Then, I discovered Kali and the chaotic twisting madness of Descent multiplayer. Around 2005, my new computer could no longer run Descent, and, after searching in vain for a game that offered the same thrill of maneuvering just at the edge of your control, I concluded that the modern games industry no longer cared about players like me.\n\nDescendent Studios has proven that conclusion premature.\n\nDescent: Underground has all the core components for thrilling multiplayer combat already in place. The drones handle excellently and have real tradeoffs in maneuverability, speed, size, power, and special tools. More importantly, the devs are pushing beyond the multiplayer of the originals by incorporating supporting roles to encourage team-based play.\n\nFor example, in Proving Grounds, I've been playing the Shaman, which has a healing ability, during team anarchy games. That healing capability naturally pushes me to navigate the map with teammates and spontaneously cooperate in taking down opponents, turning team anarchy from "anarchy where you shouldn't shoot some people" into a real team game. Based on the devs' statements, there's a lot more of these mechanics and special abilities coming, and I'm *so excited* to see how it all comes together.\n\nYes, some people are experiencing controller issues (especially with the mouse). Yes, there's no single player campaign yet. Nevertheless, given their vision, and their execution of that vision so far, I wholeheartedly recommend Descent: Underground. It is already thrilling and promises to increase in richness and variety as development proceeds.","February 20","true","76.1"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

I am really excited to see this series reborn, as I feel like the series was never fully explored.  In the current state, it has 3 multiplayer maps, and 3 ships.  There are 3 missile types, and a laser lvl 1-4 with a quad upgrade and vulcan cannon.  The gameplay is solid, the core of what made Descent feel the way it did is present in this game.  I miss the lack of a cockpit, but don't find that it makes the game any less enjoyable.  Maybe they will add it in like a toggle option for hud, however with the fast paced nature of the multiplater I think it would only get in the way.  The Multiplayer is fast paced and really fun, like an multiplayer it takes a little time to get the hang of.  It feels fairly balanced too, even the ships that are powered up can be killed by a lvl 1 laser...with a little skill.  All in all it's still early access and there is not a lot of content to speak of, so I can only say so much, but if you love Descent then this is worth getting in on now and helping them make a great game.","October 25, 2015","true","5.1"," 12 of 14 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","12","14","0","0"

You are asked to judge a title that is still on the developer’s desk, something that is constantly changing and evolving. Things you like or don’t like will probably get changed before the title releases, and what you are playing is usually missing some big components that won’t get put in there until right before the game goes gold.\n\nSo, how do you evaluate and review an Early Access game, especially one with big shoes to fill?  After playing Descent Underground for an extended period of time, it becomes clear that the best approach is to look at the core elements of the game, its soul, and even the emotions it evokes when you play.  Putting aside things like missing pieces that are still being developed or balanced, or any of those modern buzz words that we use to describe technical hurdles yet to overcome, playing Descent Underground can only be described as pure enjoyment.\n\nAll of the pieces of a truly wonderful game are already there, and incredibly polished even at this early phase. As a person who grew up playing Descent in high school, my expectations were extremely high, and my praise hard to come by for any new title with the franchise name attached. Descent has a certain cachet that no one else has been able to replicate. That rush to a fierce firefight with guns lit up, those claustrophobic and tight tunnel runs in the dark, the incredibly nuanced and deeply personal duels in multiplayer. It was a rare bird, the total package of anarchy covered in cool. After just a few minutes back in the saddle, with my flight stick in my hand, it is clear all of the magic is back, and Descent Underground flies, and fights, exactly how it should. Descent is back.\n\nSure, there are more new visual elements than there are old.  There are several different ships, now styled as drones to fly, and a few new gadgets in there too.  The maps are modern works of geometric art, and the visuals are commensurate with a high-end modern game.  But the bones of Descent, the freedom, the rush, the feeling of graceful flight, fierce battles, and a tight game that overwhelms your senses again and again is right there. The stuff that matters most. You feel connected, hooked up, part of the game, where your controller merges you with a precision machine, and how you fight and fly is an extension of you.\n\nSo that is where Descent Underground succeeds, and why it will always succeed as it goes through the rest of its development and eventual release out into the world. It has soul. No matter what else gets bolted on, the foundation is gold, Rock of Gibraltar solid, and every inch of it is thoughtful, faithful, and above all, FUN.\n","October 23, 2015","true","30.2"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

From the very first public build I thought there was something good coming out, the community involment to get the ships flying feel right what it is in the old titles showed that devs want to listen what community has to say about the game. They have their vision sure, but they do listen and things have many times changed already by community saying "this isn't working, try this." and then we have even better game.\nPersonally the very latest build made lot of things to click into place or very close to.\nAnd if you don't have controller or joystick. it plays well with mouse+kb combo, which i use more than joystick now. However, with mouse you might need to tweak settings a bit to get it where you want it.\nGame currently supports multiplayer and vs bots matches and free flight. singleplayer campaign is coming later.\nso should you get it?\nif you enjoy 6degrees of freedom games and don't mind early access roughness definetly yes.\n","February 27","true","43.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","1"

My biggest argument on reboots is the weapon/health system. What made those games definitive was not just character, story, and arsenal. It was Health Pool, Over Abundant Inventory, and you being a bad ♥♥♥, not some Halo jackass that can't carry a pistol, shotgun, another shotgun, a minigun, a rocket launcher, grenade launcher, freeze ray, devastator, and a pirate cannon, all at once.\n\nControls are mappable to your Hotas, though I find K&M alot easier to use in such confined spaced. It keeps that classic 5 guns 5 missles feel, Health Pool, Check, Need medkits, Check.

That being said, I found the game play mechanics fun and fast paced. Some of the movement animations need to be polished up, however that can be forgiven at the time as this is this games first playable public build.\n\nLoading up the game you are prompted to pick between three drone crafts to enter into a quick match, free roam, or vs bot battle.  You are then deposited into a warehouse like area and free to move around in any direction.  The arena is more than likely in space, as there is no noticeable gravity that affects your drone.  The objective of the game seems to be to fly around, kill any player on the opposing team, all while picking up power ups and health recharges.\n\nI'll post an updated review after I have a few hours of play time, however at this time I recommend this game solely on the fast paced fun factor.\n","October 23, 2015","true","1.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

I have a $300 video card, and did not notice any significant performance issues with max settings. Multiplayer is fun even on early access. Looking forward to many awesome dogfights. Sound and voice-overs need a lot of work, but graphics already look superb. Ship control does take a bit of getting used to though. Can't wait for the singleplayer campaign. My biggest frustration so far is the level corridors and turns are really small making maneuvering incredibly frustrating at times, especially when 2-3 other ships end up cramped into a single tunnel, it usually never ends well. Hopefully, this is just due to poor level design.

The game is FUN! When I get home from work, this is the game I want to play.   They produced a fun working game in 4 months.   For the next 8 months, they're going to be adding a ton of stuff to it.\n\nThis game is what early access is all about.  Early access is often code for an incomplete game that will never be complete.   Not here.   This team keeps pumping out new content, keeping it fresh and exciting AND they've already delivered content months in advance of schedule. When is the last time you've heard of a game coming out early?\n\nTWO big thumbs up for this game.\n\nNow for an actual review of the game:\n\nRight now it is multiplayer only.  The single player is down the line, so I am only reviewing what is here today.  The multi-player is intense.  The game is basically a 3d version of Quake.  After playing this game, other First person shooters will seem overly simplistic and annoying that you are stuck to a 2 dimenstional ground.  In this game, you can evade in any direction.\n\nWarning:  The game is skill based.  When you first start playing, expect to get worked.  But then you'll learn the dos and don'ts of 6 degrees of freedom dog figthing and before you know it, you'll be able to earn an even kill to death ratio (that's where I'm at right now), but THEN you'll wind up in a game w/ really good players and you'll realize you have a lot more to learn.  Which I think is a good thing.\n\nThe more you play, the more addicted it gets, because you realize there are strategies that will help you earn more kills.  One of the saving graces is your ship comes with two laser grids that you can drop behind you in narrow tunnels.  This basically kills anyone who runs into it.  So it's a great escape mechanism that helps noobies like me avoid getting hunted down.  As you start getting more advanced, you'll realize you want to power up your lasers before you get into combat so pick up and upgrade your weapons as soon as you spawn.  It takes a LONG time to kill someone with level one weapons.  Second, the vulcan cannon looks like machine gun bullets, and it is effective at a distance, since the bullets travel fast and there is a tight spread.  In contrast, the lasers do more damage, but are slow.  Lasers are great up close.\n\nI am excited to see how team game play gets fleshed out.  Right now, the predominant game type is anarchy, which is basically everyone for themselves.  If you're looking for a great deathmatch game in space, this is the game to get.\n\nLater on, a team component will be added and a single player campaign.","October 22, 2015","true","24.0"," 10 of 15 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","10","15","0","0"

For $15 you will be given access to the full game when it is released which is said to include far more features such as ship customization and a full single player campaign.  The White Box level kit was just released as well, so expect to see some player made levels soon.\n\nFirst impressions: This game fully lives up to the chaotic 6DOF Descent gameplay that I have always loved about past Descent games. I have had so much fun playing multiplayer over the past couple days.\n\nSingle Player: Before jumping into your first multiplayer game, I highly recommend playing each of the levels with bots. This will help you gain a feel for flying your ship and aiming the weapons with 6 degrees of freedom. It's really not that easy to get used to. There is a full singleplayer campaign planned but not yet implemented currently.\n\nControls: To appeal to the new generation, the videos show people playing with xbox controllers, something that I tried but am not really fond of. Personally I prefer playing with a combination of the mouse and keyboard, just like any other FPS.\n\nMultiplayer: Be patient. Spawning has a few issues and you will likely spawn right into the middle of a firefight and you will die. It happens. Early Access game. Mega missles are an instant kill, you will hear a missle lock on warning and then you will be dead. You will really enjoy the multikills that this missle will afford you when you're actually the one behind the trigger. There are alot of good pilots playing this game, so keep playing if you get your ♥♥♥ handed to you, your skill level will increase rapidly. If it doesn't, then you need to get on Twitch and see why your getting beat, because 6DOF gameplay is one of those things that you may not understand untill you see someone actually flying one of these ships the way they were designed.  Career Stats don't really matter at this point as they are being reset occasionally when big balance changes happen. Multiplayer matchmaking still has a few kinks in it, so if you go to join your first game and it appears that there are none to be found, just wait a few minutes. The game won't allow you to join a game thats almost over and there will soon be more players joining you shortly.\n\nThis game is a absolute blast to play and I highly recommend that you get it while it's on sale. If you are really on the fence, keep an eye out for live streams on Twitch, I'm sure you will get a really good idea of what this game is all about.\n\nLastly, the theme of this game is this, Pilots are flying drones in competative death sports. In the theme of that, login to Twitch and broadcast your game.\n\nSee you in the mines.","December 22, 2015","true","36.7"," 13 of 21 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","13","21","0","1"

Obviously there are still issues and I am not a particular good pilot but for 6-7 months of development it is surprisingly stable.\n\nNow the important questions: Is this game something for you? If you have no problem with playing an unfinished product and want to have fun without huge time investment, this game is for you.\n\nI never played Descent, can I play the game anyway? Sure. I did. The important thing to know is this: It is skill based. You can have fun without long training. However if you want to win, you should invest a bit of training in the basics (controls, navigation, etc). Beyond that it really depends on the players you face.\n\nHow does match making work? Right now, there is only a quick match. But later on there will be more sophisticated possibilities.\n\nConvinced? Then jump right in. Not? Watch Twitch streams of the game and follow the development and you might be convinced later.

Fans of the original Descent and its sequels will feel right at home.  Newcomers have a lot to look forward to, with everything the studio has planned for this title.\n\nIn its current state, the game is extremely stable on my system.  Performance needs optimisation, but ARK was a -lot- worse performer than this, and did a lot less when it was supposedly further along.  There are a lot of features yet to be added, and a lot of polish and optimisation to be done.  But this game is already a better buy than many AAA titles, much less a lot of Early Access games I've tried.\n\nThe studio is really going full-bore on development, and they listen to the community - and take it to heart, unlike most developers.

Hell, I even bought a SpaceOrb 360 (look it up, it's super weird) just to play Descent better. When nothing came out in the 6DOF (Six Degrees of Freedom) genre at ALL after Descent 3, it was devastating. So when I heard that a new Descent was coming, I was excited, but skeptical, since Interplay hadn't exactly released...anything...in a while. But I was impressed enough by the Kickstarter pitch to kick in the $$, and now, 6ish months later, here's my vindication.\n\nThe game is gorgeous. Not "gorgeous for an Early Access game", but genuinely breathtaking. Playing it for the first time, I felt like I was playing a pre-rendered cutscene, or the sort of thing you'd show at E3 and lie about it being "ingame." It was THAT good.\n\nThe music is a perfect blend of the futuristic synth/metal of the 2nd game and the atmospheric melodies of the 1st. Admittedly, there's not many tracks yet, but Early Access.\n\nAnd MOST importantly, the game itself is a blast to play. The ships handle exactly as they should, lasers fly like they should, and the levels twist and turn as only a proper Descent game can.\n\nMy only caveat: It's VERY light on content right now, because it just launched.\n\nOverall, my most anticipated/recommended game for the foreseeable future, and the game I fire up when my friends come over to blow their minds.","October 22, 2015","true","11.5"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

And it is back.\n\n\nI got an early access key for free. Then after playing for 10 minuets I pre-ordered it. The developer has done a great\njob in a very short amount of time. They have lots of updates and new features.

(yet)\n-Build on unreal engine 4 it has the best graphics yet seen in a game.\n-The combat is like counterstrike, you can just join in and kill some people here and there but it takes actual skill to master the laser you shoot and to calculate with the speed of the lasers where you have to aim.\n\nThere is just 1 con : this game is made on unreal engine 4 and the graphics require allotr of pc power. this game can't be played on game laptops or on low end pc's.

At this point there's slow and steady updates and it keeps getting better and better. The initial interest in this game came from Sublevel Zero, I hadn't played any 6DOF games since I was a kid growing up playing Descent on the ol' PC or Forsaken on the N64. I think this game has a ridiculous amount of potential. The Descent series are some of the greatest early gaming experiences on computers that I remember. And although this is early access, there is still a lot to enjoy. Currently players are combating online within a handful of maps. And I know there is intent to include a single player campaign, which I think will be necessary to teach new players all that is to be expected in a 6DOF (Six Degrees of Freedom) games like this, allowing them a greater ease when entering online multiplayer (cross platform too, which is awesome, 'Now we can really show those ''consolers'' the totality of their folly!') Anyways grab it while it's still in Early Access, it'll get more expensive when it's done and you'd hate to wish you "had it before it was cool" lol.\n\nThe title of this review is a reference to the greatest album of all time..","February 25","true","1.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

Yes, there are rough edges and issues. However, Descendant Studios is very keen on getting player input as they continue work on this game, and they actually act on those tips players send in. They even share a lot of their thoughts and process in their bi-weekly streams for players to critique and discuss. From what I see so far, I'm confident these guys will deliver.\n\nFor those out there who havent played a 6-degree-of-freedom game before, it's not unlike a first person shooter. However, while your average FPS allows you to run forwards, backwards, strafe left, and strafe right, a 6DOF game lets you do all that as well as strafe up, strafe down, and roll left and right like in a flight sim. Now, add in enemies who can do the same, and you have one heck of an experience that gets addictive quick.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","November 7, 2015","true","141.8"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

I will recommend based on that it is quite true to its spiritual predecessor, Descent, but...\n\nSo far in early access what we see is a bare-bones menus UI, a bunch of differently purposed ships (classes), 5 different multiplayer maps (which I expect and hope are demo maps rather than part of the final product), unfinished effects, not particularly interesting enemies, and really quite poor AI (particularly considering the quality and variation of AI in the original games all those years back).\n\nWhat is finished does look quite good. The controls plays like they should: movement is good, targetting could maybe be a bit more challenging (though fighting in full 3D can be challenging enough for many people). The ships and environments look good (textures, meshes). In-game UI looks similar to Descent, and still does it's job (I don't think radar works yet). The environments are diverse and interesting, AI is a little challenging in numbers (but no AI tactics like in Descent 3). Sounds are interesting. Atmosphere is pretty much spot-on.\n\nSo, I think the game is probably coming along as planned or close to, even though we are approaching the published release date (March 2016) with the early access being barely a demo.\n\nThen I think, I really like the look of NeonZSX. Indie game. Very descent like (obvious inspirations). And it's a sandbox game. And it's indie. And it looks large. And it looks like it has lots to do. And it has randomised worlds. And it's got very good reviews.\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/296010/?snr=1_620_4__45\n\nSo, I can't recommend this game without also recommending taking a look at NeonZSX. This is more true to the original. NeonZSX looks like it takes it to the next step. I don't think either will be like Descent 4, but I'll probably give them both a go, myself.","February 22","true","0.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I was worried there wouldn't be one but Eric Wingman Peterson himself answered my question. i love backing a game when the creator himself will answer my questions with no bs or fluff. Since then I have been able to ask him questions on the star citizen forums and even on facebook about descent and even older ga,es he was part of like Starlancer which is one of my favs. So i just wanted to say thanks again for making this and for making this quickly. Very excited to play the finished product but dont hesitate to get it early because a lot of fun is to be had already. the fact that I can use my flightstick and keyboard like I did in classic descent ga,es is just an awesome bonus.

Anyways, you can trust these guys with ur early access money, they are great people making this game. just please don't forget to make this fully gamepad supported.

However...\n\nWheres the levels? I get its early access but the few maps that it comes with are SUPER tiny. They also are quite horizontal. the first 2 Descent games had maps that would give u vertigo - they were endless mazes that had you forgetting where the exit was and madly scrambling and backtracking as the reactor counts down to zero.\n\nI sincerely hope the pickup holograms are temporary. The bright floating holographic colours clashes with the beautiful level detail and it reminds me of mario coins or some childrens game from the early 2000's. The weapon pickups that would float in D1 & D2 were high quality at the time, and made dying and retrieving your weapons an absolute joy. Now they are all 2d images inside diamonds that often block vision through cramped corridors. I would love to see a quality weapon model either floating classicaly or as a sort of scannable item through the hud from a destroyed drone or old tech left behind. (However the latter would be deviating from classic Descent - but i think it would satisfy as a next gen method to getting upgrades)\n\nEnemy briefing before each level was also something that made Descent special. As you got stronger so did the regiments of drones that were added. Seeing a model with a description and specs made finding it and encountering it in combat something to look forward to - or be fearful of. I hope this is not left out in the single player release.\n\nI am not bashing these guys for the current state of this game, i realize its under development and that there are budget constraints. I just hope the end goal is to modernize this franchise and bring back some of the charm that made it a game far ahead of its time!","March 1","true","2.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

So, let's keep a positive vibe and hope for the best]\n\nDescent Underground is still a tech demo so much worse than Overload that started development a year later and is fresh out kickstarter and already have a playable demo available free here on steam.\n\nA little background:\nDescent Underground kickstarter debuted March 2015 with $601k, being developed since.\nOverload kickstarter debut March 2016 with $303k, having the original Descent developers producing it.\n\nDescent Underground developers claims they are focusing on multiplayer and balance, and that 9 ships balance made single player hard to develop. Honestly, the 9 ships feels pretty much the same (the easy way to balance stuff). While Overload bots already feels interesting with the simplest of AI.\n\nBut since bots are subject to lots of improvement on the developer claims, let me nag at what really tells me this is a no:\nMaps are unremarkable and, although with next-genny tech inherited from Unreal Engine, the art style is nothing but greebleish and silly saturated lights. Level design is uninspired just a series of tubes without variations but cheesy intersections.\nThis is specialy important on a game with 6DOF. Overload Sample already shows variations of wide spaces, organic and mechanic mazes, and many kinds of room.\n\nThat "balance" mumbo jumbo is another downer. Something balanced will always end in RNG. What I like the most of SP is problem solving, discovering what makes a newly bot I met apparently overpowered, uncover it's patterns and find a way to deal with them with what I have. No need to 2 way balance. Specially if balance=everything feels the same.","April 15","true","1.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","5"

The end result is I kind of got very familar with the maps, twisting and twirling through them like I stole the drone I'm operating.\n\nHaving finally given a shot at multiplayer, I can safely say that this is the most fun I've had in a multiplayer combat environment in a long time. The VR helps with situational awareness, and if you've got the heart to pull the moves and control aggressively, you'll feel like a Jedi. (Even when you get blown to smithereens)\n\nAs for people playing on monitors, I can't help but think this delivers. The key element of this game - the one that rushes me to a positive rating - are the controls, which for the first time I can say truly reincarnate what I remember of the original Descent series, which I played a lot in the 90's. Many have tried to bring back the magic since, and haven't quite pulled it off. This one feels like Descent is finally back.\n\nLooking forward to the single player campaign as well. I can imagine boss fights could be brutally enjoyable, especially in VR. Some performance improvements are definitely needed but all in all this has, for me, delivered.\n\nHere's a video of the recent tests I've done (Test flight, drone fight, multiplayer anarchy; all with the Oculus Rift DK2)\nDailyMotion version (2D only; Mobile/Mac): http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3wc1lv_oculus-rift-dk2-descent-underground_tech\nWarning some strong language and lots of intense motion.","March 8","true","4.9"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","1"

Descent 3 was too different, so it's kinda sad, BUT there is some hope after all! Because Descent: Underground looks really pretty and even though it's not that good old feeling, it's again one step closer to the original.\n\nSadly, I kinda miss that 3rd-person animation when your ship gets destroyed by the enemy, or the old look of rotating weapons before you get them. I recognized only those shields, with all the other stuff I was like "It's shiny, I should probably take it.." and it makes me stop thinking and just collect everything..\n\nControls settings, especially mouse sensitivity, are quite chaotic, because I'm lazy and I don't want to spend five minutes adjusting stuff, but W-A-S-D-Ctrl-Space works perfectly for me and it feels like I've been playing like this all my life so far.\n\nI'm satisfied and looking forward to play this as a multiplayer, so I hope this project will be more popular and it deserves to be hyped!\nPlease, keep working on it, because it really looks great so far!\n\n"Oh, lots of weapons!.. feels like I've been here before.." said qurius.","November 30, 2015","true","0.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Games these days seem to be of a cookie cutter design. I can still remember the day I first laid eyes and hands on descent. My uncle called me and my siblings into his house, to show us a new game he had bought. It was Descent for the PC. He took his time to explain the contols to the each of us, and then he loaded the game on his computer. Our jaws all but hit the floor, untill then the most graphical intense game we had experienced was Mortal kombat. I still recall the feeling I had when I took the contol of the Pyro for the first time, the joystick he had was nothing more than a glorified atari joypad. Composed of a stick with a single trigger at the front and a round button on the top. Using it in concert with the keyboard was a rush indeed. Going threw the first level destoying the enemy bots untill gaining access to the infamous red door where the reactor lay in wait. I was in the zone at that point wasting no time to fire every weapon I had at it. Then the mine began to shake and the countdown began, my heart pounding as I raced to the exit. Then to my astonishment I experienced my first cutscene as my ship raced from an explosion out into space. And now many years later my dreams have been answered, A new Descent game is now a reality. I picked it up recently during the black friday sale, downloaded it as quickly as possible and went into  a multiplayer match, something I was denied in my youth. It was frantic and chaotic. A pleasure to say the least. I cannot wait for the single player campaigne. Which I hope stays true to Descent's past. Navigating a twisting and uncompramising maze to find a reactor and destroy it. At any rate thank You Descendant Studio for bringing a true classic back to life in the modern age.","December 1, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Well, considering it's as simple and early as it is right now, it's a pretty good game, but I've chosen to go for a refund.\n\nNo. It's not that I don't like this game, because I do. And I do have hopes for it. But let me put it this way: I don't trust early access as much as I did before. I will, however, get back to Descent: Underground and buy it again when/if I've seen the creators do some significant progress through their dev-blog. Regardless, I'd spend money on something complete rather than a game that is really unfinished.\n\nMy point is this: You shouldn't buy this early access game if you're not up to the task or (in my case) do not have time to help the creators make the game better. If you do however, go for it! The game looks good, sounds good and plays well after some finniky doodling with the (as of now) complicated control scheme.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/d2disciple/recommended/360950/","d2disciple","D2Disciple","http://steamcommunity.com/id/d2disciple/","53 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDescent: Underground is a wonderfully modern take on the Descent franchise.\n\nProduced by Descendent studios, a team of experienced game developers lacking legal access to the original assets of the Descent franchise, D:U is an opportunity to make a new game in the franchise that is refreshingly different, yet very "Descent." By consulting with still-active pyro-jockeys from the D1 era, the team has absolutely nailed the physics formula that made the originals so much fun to play, while at the same time producing a multiplayer-focused and feature-rich AAA-style game. As with most early access titles, it still lacks quite a bit of content, but the development team has been extremely open to feedback and suggestions and has made multiple balancing passes and bug squashes with every content update.\n\nAt the time of this writing, the game has 5 arenas, 4 game modes, 7 playable craft, 4 primary weapons, 3 secondary weapons, 2 deployable items, and a handful of craft-specific mechanics. Taking a cue from Team Fortress 2, each craft has unique abilities and stats that lend each an advantage in certain scenarios, though right now, the differences are much more subtle. The dev team has been keen to address this issue by announcing features down the pipeline that will give craft more well-defined roles, however, so I have no doubt this will be resolved eventually.\n\nFlight is smooth and fluid, but limited turn speeds mean that controls are NOT FPS-like in any sense of the word. This is undoubtedly a design holdover from the original series, which hails from an era where a joystick was a staple controller choice for most PC games. Since mouse-and-keyboard controls are much more common now, I would have liked to have seen this design choice abandoned in favor of a more modern FPS-style mouselook design, with the overall movement speed of craft widened to account for the quickness of control. But it's a sacred cow that the Descent community as a whole refuses to sacrifice, and that's okay, as this is a core Descent game made by Descent fans, for Descent fans. Some of the inherent weirdness of controlling the heavier craft is mitigated by the mouse inertia feature, which applies inertia to quick mouse turns, meaning 180-degree spins can be done while repositioning the mouse quickly. As a long time joystick user, relearning the mouse controls have been a challenge, but I've managed to roughly equal my previous skill over time. I do, however, recommend the use of a joystick or a solid, high-DPI mouse - my Logitech G302 (a $30 "MOBA" mouse) is just about right at it's highest 4,000 DPI setting.\n\nSound design is excellent, with most of the music being a mix of industrial and atmospheric rock, composed by Daniel Wentz, who was involved with the sound design of both Descent 2 and the Freespace series. Some of the sound effects, particularly the weapon sounds, are a bit weak and muted, however. It's far from bad; I just would like for the action to sound as visceral as it looks.\n\nSpeaking of how it looks, it looks great. That said, the Unreal 4 engine requires some serious horsepower and doesn't scale as well as some other engines. This isn't a knock on Descendent - they're using the latest and greatest technology to make a stunning-looking, almost photo-realistic-yet-industrially-stylized multiplayer shooter - but it is a disappointment on the part of Epic games. Unreal 3 was an engine that scaled amazingly well to even borderline-legacy hardware, yet manages to still look incredibly rich and detailed on high end hardware to this day. Unreal 4 taxes hardware in a way that doesn't seem to meaningfully add to the experience, while at the same time providing eye-candy that some potential players just won't be able to render. Moreover, I'm not sure the extra visuals are worth it - with all settings at high, some of the bloom and occlusion, while gorgeous, can impact the player's ability to see during an intense firefight. I have to run D:U at low settings on 1366x768 to get a solid framerate, and this is on a laptop with a quad-core i7 processor, 8GB of RAM, and an nVidia Geforce GTX 960M with a whopping 4GB of texture VRAM. On my budget desktop, which has an Athlon x4 processor, 8GB of 2400MHz RAM, and a Radeon R7 250 GPU, D:U fares even worse: 1024x768 with all options turned off and "simple dynamic lighting" on (a "nuclear option" for low-end hardware that significantly alters lighting and detrimentally impacts gameplay) is all I can muster. If you can't run most modern games at 1080p at a playable framerate, you may have trouble running D:U at even lower resolutions.\n\nOnline, things are pretty stable. With a relatively small playerbase, matchmaking has been primarily limited to randomly-generated "quick matches." I have, however, never experienced any dropped connections or noticeable lag. I have heard high-ping connections from countries outside the US may experience some lag, so be aware of this. While the playerbase rarely exceeds 2-8 players at any given time, it's less of an issue than you might initally think, since the majority of Descent players are extremely committed and play multiple times a week. Also, be aware many of the most dedicated players are active in another, more up-to-date build of D:U called "proving grounds" - which is available for beta testing for a monthly subscription of $10.\n\nNewcomers may find the difficulty curve startlingly sharp; many players (such as myself) have been playing Descent, in one form or another, for over a decade or even decades. This can lead to some frustration initially as high-level play can cause newcomers to end matches in the negatives. But as communities go, Descent's is one of the most open and welcoming groups I've ever been a part of, and many experienced players will take time out for 1v1 matches in order to help newcomers learn the ropes. My advice - stick with it. I started out online in the mid-2000s with Descent 3, playing some truly remarkable players, and pushing through that first 5 to 10 hours of outright slaughter was rewarded with greatly increased skill and competitiveness.\n\nOverall, I would say that Descent: Underground is off to a really good start, even if it has been a bit of a slow go. The developers are taking things one step at a time to make sure to deliver the best possible Descent game this can be, and their effort shows. If you have the hardware to run it properly and the guts to endure the initial phase of the multiplayer experience, you'll be rewarded with a finely-tuned, highly-enjoyable 6-degrees-of-freedom multiplayer shooter that looks and feels like the fast-paced, no-nonsense, true Descent experience married to the complexity and richness of a modern AAA title.","March 13","true","26.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","4"

There I won the match and got a free game key. I decided to try this game out, because it looked interesting, and I had fun while demoing it. I just finished a Bot-round before writing this and It was pretty interesting and enjoyable.\nSome things to know however:\n1."It's anarchy in every direction" is what I was told before demoing the game. The game is First-Person and does, indeed, turn and spin in different directions. The game is able to be played using VR (Virtual Reality) technology and they even let people demo it using the technology. While I was watching a friend of mine play a match at the expo, 4 people in a row took off the VR headset during the game. Basically, if you easily get motion sick real easily, VR is not the way to go. Personally I never tried the VR due to how many people took it off, but remember that this game is still in Early access, so sensitivity VR wise may change in the Distant future.\n\n2.This game's graphics are AMAZING, and with amazing graphics to run, you need a well made computer. I do believe that you can tweak it to where it can run decently (For me I have a custom built gaming PC, and it usually runs games like this pretty well.)  I ran the game at around 60fps on the default settings. The Graphic settings go as follows: Low, Medium, High, Ultra, VR (Virtual Reality) and Custom. I haven't played around with the custom yet, but I'll write another review next to this one on how it works  if   I figure it out. This game can also be set to Windowed or Full screen mode, and you can change the resolution, just like any other game. You can also change the Field of view, which could come in handy, I'll add on to that when I try it out. You can also enable Virtual reality headsets for the ingame flight, but remember that it's expirimental, so it might be really sensitive, but I don't own a VR headset, so just write a review on the VR if you can, because I'm interested to see how it is.\n\n3.So far there is only ONE mode of the game, which is multiplayer. As of the time of me writing this, Campaign mode is still in development. When you click 'Start' (A.K.A Multiplayer for now) a screen will pop up with different ship models for you to fly. Also, there are buttons on top of the ship model selection area which determine which type of game you want to play. There are 3 buttons: Multiplayer, Test flight and Vs. Bots. Multiplayer has 4 options: Quick match (which is what I played at the expo, where basically you play against other people in a round of deathmatch), Create match (which is kind of self-explanatory), Enter Private key (Which, by my guess is a way to play with friends in a private match) and cancel. Test Flight is just playing around with the ships and learning controls and such (which I highly reccomend for first time players, so you can test out the controls and get to know the game). Vs. Bots is a game mode that spawns you in a map and spawns random drone bots. The difficulty gets increasingly harder and the number of bots spawned increases as the game goes on.\n\n\nIf I were to rate this game on a scale of 1-10 1 being horrible and 10 being amazing, I'd give it a 10/10 IGN would play again :P.\n\n","March 20","true","0.9"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","42","5","12","0","2"

As I paid money for the game, I am keeping my review unedited. Although I have greater hopes now that I have heard from them.]\n\nWarning: I only played 20 minutes. So take this as you wish...\n\nThis is NOT a finished game in any sense, it shouldn't even be considered an Early Release. While basic flight controls and multiplayer are working, the presentation and game play are lacking any polish. Graphic glitches like invisible gatling fire and enemies that dont move or instantly snap around to face you are abundant. Several times I found a enemy bot, opened fire for almost 10-15 seconds continously, only to have the bot suddenly materialize closer and shoot me a few times to destroy me. The bots also don't understand three dimensional space. I could hide under their z axis and they wouldn't find me.\n\nBut the most disappointing aspect here is the lack of "feel" that made the first two games so amazing. I'm 44, I played Interplay games when they were hot of the shelf. I remember the emotional investment and how every laser, every missle, and every sheild pickup was satisfying. Not just the great sound effects which made you feel the pounds of your fire upon the bots, but also that advantage you got from that extra one missle that you found from a secret room.\n\nSorry. I love Descent, but as a classic gamer, I cannot endorse this remake until the development team puts some effort into the gameplay presentation.

I have since installed the latest Nvidia drivers and now the game runs at a respectable 50 - 120 fps. So I retract my original statement that this game is unoptimized. It runs fine on a GTX 765m.\n\nNow that I have been able to actually run the game at a decent framerate, I have put some more time into playing the multiplayer mode and the offline vs. bots mode. Here is my updated review:\n\n*******************************************************************************************************\n\nThis game has promise, but in its current state there is little content to justify the $33 CAD price. There is no single-player campaign. There is no real tutorial. There is an online multiplayer mode and an offline mode vs. bots. There are several maps right now, all of which look unfinished (e.g. missing textures, missing lightmaps).\n\n\nLevel Design:\n\nThe trailers show some pretty neat looking maps that feature large, wide-open spaces and interesting and varied terrain. To my disappointment, these maps don't seem to actually exist in the game yet. There are only a handful of maps to choose from. They are all much smaller and simpler than what was depicted in the trailer.\n\nSince Descent: Underground appears to take place in a zero-gravity environment, I was expecting the level design to take advantage of this increased spatial freedom. I was hoping for more organically-shaped levels that would let you really feel like you were in an environment with no "up" or "down" directions. Unfortunately, the several maps I played just consisted of simple, boxy rectilinear rooms connected by some boring corridors. Everything looks like it's constrained to a grid. Hell, even the original Descent had more organic, free-form geometry than this. And they had a much lower polygon budget to work with.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe visual quality is a bit hit-or-miss. Some of the rock textures on the walls look fantastic. Some of the lightmaps look beautiful, while others look like glitchy messes. The levels all look incomplete. Some objects are rendered with lightmaps, normal maps and specular reflections. Other objects look like they're just rendered with a simple untextured gouraud shading model. Most annoyingly, the ships don't look like they're rendered with any lighting at all. They're just flat ambient.\n\nGameplay:\n\nThe game is pretty boring, to be honest. In the offline mode, you fly around in a small, claustrophobic map while the game spawns multiple waves of bots. Each wave consists of a small number (two or three?) bots. The AI is dumb. Really dumb. The bots will basically wander around the map at a very slow speed. When a bot sees you, it will shoot directly at you while either A) standing still or B) slowly flying towards you. The enemy AI doesn't seem to have any pathfinding. It doesn't act with any sort of strategy. Enemy bots will shoot at you even if there is a solid obstacle between you and the bot (i.e. they will just shoot at the wall).\n\nThe online multiplayer mode is pretty boring as well. As stated above, the maps are rather simple and don't really allow for interesting gameplay. Most rooms are empty and don't have any cover to hide behind. So firefights mostly consist of two players shooting at each other at point-blank range in an empty room. What makes this even more boring is that movement is sluggish; ships turn at a frustratingly slow rate, which makes for plodding, slow-paced combat.\n\nVerdict:\n\nI hope eventually we will be able to play the game that was promised in the trailer. Until then, Descent Underground is basically an early-stage tech demo.","May 13","false","2.0"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","3"

Indeed, the developers seem rather keen on providing you with plenty of updates and logs of their progress.  As it stands now though, unless you are planning to play multi-player matches with your friends who have also bought the game (an experience you may be likely to enjoy) then I can't recommend it.\n\nCurrently the single player experience is almost completely non-existent, hopefully it's just taking the backseat till closer to release, and current development seems singularly focused on the multi-player death-match aspect of the game.\n\nFor the single player, as I imagine most of you are: Wait\n(I'm in this camp so that bias plays heavily in my recommendation)\n\nFor the multi-player fanatic with like-minded friends:  Maybe.  If you are interested in actively giving constructive feed-back to the devs then actually sure, but if that's you then you are likely the minority and I can't in good conscious give a positive review based on appeal to a rather unique subset of the gaming population.\n\nStill hoping that just maybe one of these old-school reboots knocks it out of the park, this one definately shows potential.","December 21, 2015","false","0.4"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","3"

In its current state I wouldnt recommend the game for old descent multiplayers the following reasons.\n\nMaps are pretty claustrophobic. There are two maps that are playable in multiplayer, as they offer at least some space for maneuvering. The maps are also quite small in overall size, which is good in the current state of the playerbase. Usually I find a handful of players to play with at best, but I do play during the day in Europe so that could also be part of the problem.\n\nThe afterburner has been pretty much made useless. In its current state it is used as a consumable, and the game is pretty slow in tempo because you cant really use the boost as you would in the older versions.\n\nThe game is graphically okay, though the ships do seem quite outdated. What bothers me more about the ships is that they move kind of twitchy. This is probably due to servers in being in the US and Im playing from Europe. Some of the ships jump around a lot, and the multiplayer is barely enjoyable.\n\nGonna end on a positive note. The graphics are nice overall, and the ships handle pretty well. Weapons are the old favourites. I hope the dev team does focus on the multiplayer, as that will keep the playerbase alive. Overall the game feems familiar, though the ships feel kinda tame(afterburner).","March 14","false","4.3"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","3"

(I'm running an i7 4790K, GTX 970 - framerate is not what I am referring to in respect of speed) I'm referring to the way the ship moves, in DXX you feel like you are gliding, this feels like moving through syrup - you feel "heavy" and this is in any of the number of craft available.\n\nMouse and keyboard are the weapon of choice here - though it is perfectly playable with a HOTAS, Xbox 360 controller, Steam Controller as well.
