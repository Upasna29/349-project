It does not use any advantages of being a PC game. Its price looks nice, but it is not, since this game -the same exact game- is also in Kongregate with no difference other than Steam achievements and mod support. Here is the link: http://www.kongregate.com/games/ratzngodz/1quest\n\nIt is good to have a skill-based (DCSS style) game in steam, but it would be better if it was actually a PC game, not a simplistic enlarged mobile game. And since DCSS is free, I am okay with its being rather obscure about its mechanics, but in this case, the game just assumes player knows about everything and I dont think this is a good exercise for a non-free game.\n\nIt is not enhanced version or something, even the fonts which is chosen for being easy to read for small screen size  is there. There is no art style, but I am okay with no art at all in some roguelikes. There is only one soundtrack, and with this I am thinking about if it just chooses not to have it, it would not look this bad.\n\nTLDR: If you want to play a good roguelike on your mobile phone, this will be your game. I did not play it throughly, but mechanics seem rather solid. If it gets updated for Steam specifically, you might consider buying it, other than that just add Kongregate link to your bookmarks and check time to time.\n\nUPDATE: Apparently, modding support did not mean Steam Workshop support (for now). It only meant many things can be changed if you tried hard, which is exactly the same for all other games. So, mod support is not a feature, it is an expectation on behalf of developer.","December 5, 2014","false","3.3"," 132 of 163 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","132","163","0","10"

Really, the class customization is the big draw here.\n\nIt's something to get if you're really struggling to find a good rogue like, to at least try out.\n\nSome initial first impressions here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-ail1D9mv4","December 3, 2014","true","3.5"," 37 of 54 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","37","54","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hippyshake/recommended/332710/","hippyshake","Hippyshake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hippyshake/","1352 products in account","At first glance, 1Quest seems like a fairly simplistic, but brutally hard, roguelike. Part of that impression is because the lack of a tutorial leaves you to discover the game's intricacies on your own. The more time you spend playing and examining the GUI however, the more depth you'll find. 1Quest takes the standard RPG method of character building, combines it with the random item collecting of Diablo, the skill trees of Fable, and adds a bit of turn-based strategy to create a complex game that, unlike most roguelikes these days, can be played countless times with a different feel each time.\n\nThe gist of the plot is this: Bad Guy has captured several children and the princess. Take too long to find and kill him (hopefully, your princess is not in another castle!), and those children begin to die. Thankfully, the game gives you extra days (one per child) to complete your task, but you'll really need to dig into the mechanics to achieve your goal.  Take too long, and eventually Bad Guy will come to you and then...well, you know. Might as well just quit and hit the "New Game" button.\n\nPaths to Bad Guy's castle are branching, although, as each map along the way is procedurally generated, this really serves no purpose other than to give you a spurious sense of choice. Killing mobs gives you experience points that you can spend on core traits or skills, and different class skills can be combined to make, for example, a Battlemage, or an Arcane Archer. The possibilities are dang-near endless. Adding to the challenge is that only one of your class skills can be activated (even if it's passive in nature) at any given time. As a Rogue, do you increase your defenses via your combat stats, or add armor piercing capabilities to your weapons? As a Mage, do you reduce the cost of your spells, or increase their range? It's the actual choices like these that make this game incredibly flexible and provide near-unlimited replayability.\n\nThe main complaint I see online is that the game's dungeon generating process is unfair (or "done poorly," as one Youtuber put it), and, because of this, it's just too hard. I believe that to be false. First off, because I see those same players rushing headlong into the middle of an area before even taking the time to see what's there, ignoring heart (health) drops, making premature and incorrect assumptions about class skills (yes, rogues really can detect and avoid traps), and leaving valuable items on the floor. At that point, it's not the game's fault you've been surrounded and defeated, it's yours. Second, surviving a ton of  mobs is completely possible; you're just not going to figure out the tactics involved on your first time through the game. So many Roguelike players are used to just bashing their way through a battlefield and healing after, that the thought of strategic gameplay seems almost foreign. Make that mistake while playing 1Quest, and you will die. A lot.\n\nIn defense of the complainers, though: The game gives you no help (other than mouseover, contextual tips), so this attitude really is, in part, the developer's fault. Players are used to simple games; 1Quest appears to be simple, so most will assume it is "unfair" and move on. Give those people a public forum, and there goes the chance of the game finding the right audience. In the case of 1Quest, this would be a very sad thing for Roguelike lovers, indeed. If you are at all interested in buying a copy, be prepared to spend a fair amount of time just exploring the various buttons and figuring out what everything does.\n\nAs for the rest: The graphics are average at best, and the music, while serviceable, will grow tiring pretty quickly. There is so much goodness in the actual gameplay however, that, were they to improve the A/V and add a tutorial, I would happily drop $20 US on this. As it stands now, as long as you are aware of what this is going into it, 1Quest is easily worth the current list price of $6.99 (and I'd still recommend it as a value up to the $12 mark).\n\nAnd, as an additional incentive, the dev has recently  hinted at Workshop support. Schwing! (EDIT to add: Today (Dec 9, 2014) the developer announced support for custom mods, although not throught the Steam Workshop more information can be found right here.)\n\nHighly, highly recommended.","December 4, 2014","true","6.7"," 24 of 33 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","24","33","0","0"

There is a lot of loot to be found, but I haven't found a store to sell items, so your pack fills with junk very quickly.\n\nCLASSES\nA few different classes are offered: warrior, mage, rogue, hybrid, etc. along with different races. Sadly it is very unbalanced right now. A warrior will die very quickly, and has no way to replenish health other than potions. Whereas a mage can wait for a turn and regain some energy/mana. The game also rewards ranged combat.\n\nEven as a mage, I sometimes fight a critter I've killed before, but for no apparent reason, this one evades every single attack. With limited attacking options, all I can do is wait for my inevitable death. I suppose I could run to the exit and flee the dungeon, but that has the same effect as dying, and would likely take longer.\n\nISSUES\nWhen you die, it resets progress on the current dungeon (randomised next time to enter) and you lose the xp you gained. However, any potions used or items gained, are still in your possession.\n\nThere are no health bars on the monsters, so the damage numbers appearing in the log are meaningless, as you have no percentage to base them on, and don't know if you should keep fighting or flee.\n\nSUMMARY:\nIf you get this game in a bundle, it's worth tinkering around in your spare time.

Scavenging every inch of some forgotten tomb in hopes of finding treasure that might help me scavenge even deeper. Rogue-likes are also a passion. Permadeath really keeps one on his toes. Combining these two together seems like the perfect marriage, I’ve been screaming for games like this, with such amazing replayability, since I was a child, and developers have answered my cries in absolute droves. The quirky Dungeons of Dredmor, the mathematical Desktop Dungeons, the daring Spelunky… All amazing games that, while similar, have been able to carve out their own niche. Is 1Quest able to do the same? I found it came quite close, but it’s surely not without it’s shortcomings. Without further adieu, let’s take a look at 1Quest.\n\n1Quest has a more realistic look than most of its competitors, and it captures the dark story and serious nature of the game quite well. With a story centering around a demonic sacrifice, this ain’t your grandma’s RPG. If she even plays RPGs. She seems more like an FPS gal… Erm, anyways… It is a turn-based RPG, but moves fluidly without a move-counter. Enemies will pursue when you move, but if you stop and go AFK, they will politely wait for you to get back. You can select between 5 races and (currently) 4 classes. There is some obvious synergy, such as the Orc Warrior, but if you feel the need to step up the difficulty, nobody is going to tell you not to roll an Orc Priest. The classes feel quite different during play and will require different strategies to complete the same tasks, which is great for aforementioned replayability. The UI is quite intuitive, but the default control scheme seems like a total mess for the way I tend to place my hands… Luckily you are able to rebind everything to your liking.\n\nThere are a multitude of different dungeons, offering their own buffs, creatures, and traps… All of which you will become uncomfortably familiar with. You have seven days to cross the map, if you don’t want to lose any children, and completing it in that time will give you one of two “good” endings. If you go past the seven days, a child will die each day until the 9th and final child. This gives you 5 chances to get to the final castle, (for those doing the math) so you must choose your path wisely. If you get completely bamboozled by a dungeon, it is possible to change your course, but it may be wise to try and complete the dungeon you picked, since it will be rerandomized upon your return… And since the clock is ticking to keep those kids from being sacrificed, and blazing a new trail can cost precious days. Overall a very fun game if you enjoy scraping stats together while racing against the clock to beat the big baddie.\n\nOn the downside to this game, the music and sound effects don’t do a thing for me. Generic, bland, and maybe even kinda grating after a while. Many of the enemies are simply reskinned instead of being something completely different to match the new dungeons you delve into. The enemies are still quite varied though, and the hero sprite is quite lovely. Different races and classes are represented with the equipment given to them. Because everyone knows RPGs are about 20% fashion-show… Give or take. Still, might be nice to see a bit more love shown to the critters you’ll be beating on for the entire game.Getting used to the keypad/spacebar combo doesn’t quite feel right to me, but is the most efficient way to move diagonal, which has nothing to do with the game and is just a personal gripe. The game doesn’t do much that its predecessors haven’t, and struggles to really create an identity, but the timed aspect is engaging and the core mechanics are there, and done nicely. There is a lot to love about this game, but it’s likely for the more hardcore fans of the genre.\n\nSummary: A dungeon-delving roguelike with an intense difficulty curve.\n\nFinal Score: 6/10 for gameplay and replayability. 8/10 with better keybindings, music/SFX, enemy sprites.","December 10, 2014","true","0.9"," 10 of 17 people (59%) found this review helpful","59","10","17","0","0"

The closest thing I've played to a game like this would be Diablo 3 so this review will be written from the typical gamer’s mentality so please excuse my ignorance.\n\nMy first play through was rather confusing. I picked warrior as its the typical starter character. Pretty simple right, you hit stuff with a sword and have a shield for defense = win!.... nope! not in this, I did ok for a little while then got destroyed by ranged units or a random elite monster. The thing with the stronger units is they can be hard to pick out, sometimes they have a small icon next to them, sometimes they are a different color or you just suddenly see your health plummeting.....\nAnyway, I picked up a few energy potions and used them when I ran out of energy (which is required for do any kind of attack, oh and you can’t leave or you fail which I found out the hard way) when I ran out of energy potions I was stumped about how to get my energy back up. I looked through the menus in the game, nothing to be found in terms of controls or any kind of obvious visual indication to be seen. After a few attempts (yes I died because I ran out of energy) I figured out there’s a rest button. That brings me into my next point.\n\nThere is no how to play, no controls your just on your own. Sometimes this can be a good thing as the player learns from experience but when something as simple as energy is aka the ability to attack is manual by the click of a button thats not intuitive at all but I understand why its done this way as its designed to force the player to manage combat and energy as to not make it just become a hack and slash (which I played it like half the time anyway, when I was just leveling/ farming)\n\nI switched to Rogue, which I beat the game with, saved the princess and the world was saved from eternal darkness. woooooh.... well a few kids died or something but who cares about them right.\n\nSo I went on to complete the achievements like I always try to do and..... after 10+ attempts, multiple character/ setup revisions and 12 hours of game time.... I got... no achievements. I looked online and read that a few people did the achievements playing as Priest, or Mage which I tried and died... pretty quickly. The issue here is there’s no way of knowing that types of gear or spells work best for different classes or on different monsters.. like...... at..........all.\n\nI decided to do a run to complete the "beat campaign with no deaths" achievement. I got all the way to the end by doing each level tier twice to make sure I had good gear for the higher levels and to make sure I was strong enough to get through the levels without DIEING, which I found I could only do by doing each level tier twice. I got all the way to the end where the cultist was, killed him and everyone in the room. Quest complete right! NOPE, I open the door to where the princess is being held and the moment I open the door there’s a acid lizard in the top right that’s spits acid at me.... as I'm standing in the doorway, THE PRINCESS THINKS "Oh look the exit, lahdedaBLARG now I'm dead because I walked in the ACID"\n\n\nSO, I came back the next day and I decided to do it one more time, this time trying to summon the demon lord which I'D DIED TO TWICE BEFORE EVEN WITH OP GEAR BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THINGS WORKED AGAIN'ST IT WITCH IS APPARENTLY NOTHING! so I get all the way to the end like before, kill everyone in the room and make my way to where the princess is and I'm thinking ok, this is it now I just need to kill the princess to summon the demon lord with a AOE spell because I read from a discussion post "There is only way to summon the demon. You know how the blood cult does? :) You may need some area spells ..." So I use blizzard and it does 32 damage to the princess, she disappears and I assume she died....but no demon lord,...... uhhhh ok, I look around... nothing. I leave the level, CONGRATS YOU BEAT THE GAME!\n\nONLY THING IS I DIDN'T GET THE NO DEATHS ACHEIVEMENT BECUASE I THINK I KILLED HER BUT IT STILL SHOWED THE WIN SCREEN?! ok I'm done, never again. I don't dislike this game even though my use of caps might suggest, I enjoyed my successful playthrough and collecting new loot that I could compare and update but what I don't like is when I put hours into trying to do something then get screwed over RIGHT....AT....THE....END....TWICE!\n\n5/10Enjoyed first playthrough, got screwed over twice","February 12","true","20.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It'S not bad but it's not good either. First of all the game has no proper tutorial which is fundemental for a rogue like. I still have no clue what i have to do or what's my goal. The gameplay feels like a typical turn based rogue like. Click on monsters untill the die gather loot and use you skills, kill more monsters and evtenually level up. Sounds good to me? But i dunno why and what it is but the standard rogue like gameplay is not enough for this title. You don't even have to think in 1QUEST you can just click on monsters and the die, You have skills but you don't have to use them to succeed. Sometimes there are so many enemies on the screen that if you take one turn you immediately die. There are monsters that are just o.p. and they break the game.  TH pixel art looks beautiful but the overall interface and HUD just look disgusting. The devs just took normal fonts and mixed them with pixel-art.

Really?\nThe game 1Quest is a procedural RPG game that tries to revive the feel of Moria, Rogue, Hack and Omega, in some it really manages to do so, in others not.\n\nGRAPHICS: - Actually the graphics aren't so good as to comparable games, even Letters and Symbols would have more apeal than some of the arts that are presented here.\n\nSOUND: -- The original Rogue had no sound and this was good. Especially this continous Dum dum di bum... it's plain enervating - after a while you wish to either shut out the boxes, or take up your shotgun and blast them.\n\nPLAYABILITY: + The game is quite easy to learn, sadly on the bad side there is some issue with the hybrid classes or better said "Prestige"-Classes, also the balancing is off course.\n\nGenretype Specialities:\n\nLEVELING: - The leveling and respective the balancing is way off, a game should be challenging, but modern games should keep also in mind that sometimes the player shouldn't be utterly frustrated, especially with leveling and class generation there could have been done a lot more. The stats are also a totally underrated matter in this game.\n\nVARIANCE: - There is no high level of choice, just some base choices could be made during gameplay, the rest is actual hack and slay, choices are possible in classes, and which Hex you take to continue your adventure.\n\nSTORY: 0 The story actually is nothing special, the way it is presented can for veterans of the genre be very annoying. It still has potential for developement.\n\nOVERALL:  Five Minus, One Plus, One Neutral = Four Minus.\n\nThe game actually is not the tire, invented new. It has some misunderstandings, especially the roguelike, which now turns up for procedurally generated content. And Permadeath, which actually means... permanent death, not resurrection and respawn after a loss of just one day.\n\nYou are right if you say "Hey, but graphics and sound aren't that important for a game that is created as a conmemoration for Rogue or Hack." But I have to say, then the programmer should also have been thoughful to use no sound at all.\n\nSure it is a casual game, nearly every game with the original games in mind would be called casual, regardless how high the difficulty was. They were games to try how far you would get, given some limited time, they were fun, and satisfied with simplicity and challenges.\n\nValue-for-Money ratio: 0\n\nThough the game has a lot of drawbacks, it's still fun to play to some limits. Although the price might seem a tad high at first you have to keep in mind that it offers a lot of actual playtime. Therefore I won't give it a K. O. rating here.\n\nOverall, Not Recommended\nSure, the game has some bright sides and it's trying hard to capture the original Rogue-Feeling, it's actually suffering a lot because of the issues I described above. Still it might be fun to play it now and then, but... the sound alone is sufferable only by masochists. There are a lot of games, that have the same price tag, a tad higher or even lower that offer a lot more of the same gameplay that was tried to emulate here. And it actually might be better to try another "Roguelike" - but for fans of the genre it might be a good diversion, for a while.","April 9","false","19.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

This game is sadly no fun at all. Ultimatively there are only 2 ways to win in this game. It is\n\nA) Have a hell-load of luck\nB) The Patience to somehow analyze this broken mess of a combat system and exploit any im-balance that you find.\n\nAnd I have neither.\n\nSomehow the game feels like it was intended for an after-death progression-system which was never included. You will never Progress unlesss you fall under A or B.\n\nYou WILL hate the Blobs in this game, especially if you tried to go close-combat focused. These things saw you ambition, and with their appearance just let you know: "No! To hell with you!"\n\nIf you are one of those patient B people be adviced: At default there are automatic stat and skill progressions in place, you have to deactivate that in-game, so that you can choose your progression for yourself, otherwise the points will be gone.\n\nThe automatic choices work well for the first 2-3 levels, after that you're just slaughtered. That's why I guess it might very well be possible to comfortably beat the game if you analyze the hell out of it and concentrate on mid-maxing as much as possible.\n\nI lack that ambition. I wasted already 7,4 hours total on this game and I don't have the feeling of having accomplished anything. I just feel that there is something missing to make the game FUN instead of a Math-Exam.

I detect all those things in this game :) With the recent explosion of "roguelike" games, I've came across /many/ terrible, terrible games.\n\nI don't want to only be able to equip body armor, a helmet, a ring, and a weapon.\nI don't like character tiles that stand up beyond a single tile's size (lookin' at you, Dredmor!)\nI don't like simplified /anything/..\nI dislike cartoony, goofy graphics, for the most part (now lookin' at you, Battlepaths.. and a bit of Dredmor)\nWorst of all, I can't stand a "rogue" that doesn't try to kill you (unfairly, hopefully)..\n\nThis game.. is clear for all the above :) As far as it having phone/tablet roots, I was unaware and unable to detect that myself in my mighty 13 minutes played.. Controls seemed solid and very usable.. At the very least it has the 1-9 hotkeys and full numpad support, which means the devs put some decent work in when porting it over.. I think the biggest problem with "phone games" is that 90% of them are built to be small, casual games from Day 1.. This game doesn't share any family lineage with Flappy Bird :) The 'cutscene' art style (on some of the cards, too), reminds me of Monster Hunter and a couple Legend of Zelda games (quality stuff :> )\n\nAnyway, from my 13 minutes played, I'll say that this game is very good. I've played ADOM, Angband (ZAngband, Kangband, Oangband, -band so-forth-and-so-on), DC:SS, Dwarf Fort adv mode, Brogue, Nethack, Ivan, Ragnarok, Valhalla, ProspectorRL, Incursion, and a hundred others..  I've also played rogue-versions of Doom, Mass Effect, Grand Theft Auto, Diablo, XCOM, Dungeon Keeper and Dark Souls.. Now that I've name-dropped, I'd say that unless you are a current and avid player of Stone Soup or equivalent, then this is a good middle-ground between content and polish.. The hard part about competing with the Stone Soup is how long the soup has been cooking (same thing with Dwarf Fort vs Gnomoria.. Gnomoria is /great/, unless you're an avid, current DF player.. but if you've never played DF then Gnomoria will blow you away..)\n\nIts good!

The gameplay, though...\n\nI can say I'm not the biggest fan of this kind brutal, borderline unfair level of difficulty when it is combined with a "time limit". It creates too much stress and having just one defeat is usually grounds for restarting. Calling a roguelike "luck-based" is a bit redundant, but I can't think of a better word to describe it when it comes to the combat and general survival, there's always one side who dominates the entire fight and, in the starting levels, it's almost always the enemy.\n\nThat said, the game is extremely fun to play when you don't focus directly on winning every round. It's very fast for a turn-based game and it's always a satisfying feeling when you slice an enemy and the delicious "hit" sound effect plays. The only real problem I've had was with the controls, which can sometimes be a bit confusing (took me forever to figure out how to use ranged weapons).\n\nIf you have a yearning for a punishing roguelike, then this game is definitely worth your money.
