The game is based on bringing an orb from the center of the map and throwing it in the other teams goal, located several platforms away. Doing so gives you a seed which you plant on the platforms to provide powerups. All players are provided a rifle which propels players shot, both teammates and enemies, which, when used properly, leads to an very interesting gameplay.\n\nThe developers are very forward sometimes join games in progress, which is nice and helps make the small community better. The only negative is the small community, which is something I hope goes away over time!","November 25, 2013","true","2.3"," 132 of 168 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","132","168","0","0"

One of my friends got a 4-pack during the free weekend and we all played a few hours. 3 days later the community was dead and there was nobody on any of the servers. I've been thinking about why this happened.\n\nFirst of all,  the player has only 3 weapons- the projectile weapon (rocket launcher), the railgun (sniper weapon), and melee. Out of the 6 plants that players can plant on captured platforms, only the turret and the ramp are useful in most situations. This severely limits the player's playstyle and makes the overall game less interesting.\n\nSecondly, because the three combat options are hitting a fast moving enemy with your fist while moving very fast, shooting a fast moving enemy with a projectile weapon with a tiny area of effect, or sniping a fast moving enemy without any sort of scope there will be a huge skill gap. New players will have a very hard time actually doing anything, so they won't want to stick around. The only way to get better is to practice.\n\nThis brings me to my third point; you can't practice because there is nobody to practice against. Most of the time, there are zero players on. The only time anyone is on is for the weekly dev game and the occasional password-protected tournament match.\n\nAlso, a lot of the maps aren't much fun to play. The only good maps are the ones with ball spawn areas that are much lower than the goals. Putting the ball spawn lower down makes it easily accessible from multiple routes, making it harder to camp the ball. It also makes it easier to defend because the ball carrier has to climb all the way up to the goal. On a flat map, one team gets to the ball first, camps there, and can easily hold off the other team while they send one player to zip across the map with a powerup and score instantly over and over again.\n\nTo the devs- I still think this game is very promising. If you can update it to make it more diverse and suitable for multiple playstyles and narrow the skill gap, then get it featured on the store frontpage with a sale you might be able to build a lasting player base.","March 17, 2014","false","8.6"," 86 of 117 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","86","117","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/recommended/244590/","snortcannon","Snort Cannon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/snortcannon/","1320 products in account","What a wonderful game, but the sad fact is the community didn't stick around for too long.\n\nEpigenesis is a very interesting title. It's a sports game mixed with fast paced parkour FPS. The goal is simple, you go to the center of the arena to capture a ball which you need to take to the opposite side of the arena and score goals, after each goal you get a seed which is used to set up boosters, defense systems and turrets to fight alongside with you. When you plant the final seed on the opposing hoop the game is instantly won.\n\nThe title looks alright for the most part and maxed out it runs almost perfectly, apart from some slight FPS drops when the action gets too fast.\n\nThe arenas are built so you have to jump around platforms to get to where you need to go and sometimes the jumping is really tough to control, sometimes you miss your mark and sometimes you go overboard.\n\nThe game has a single player mode which has five arenas to play through and you can choose how many bots are on the arena on your team and on the opposing team.\n\nThis game is great and is a ton of fun too, but there is one major flaw and that the game is completely dead. Unless you have a friend to play alongside with you except to play solo only.\n\nThe game alone is still pretty fun, but with people it would be even wore fun.\n\nI would love to recommend this game to everyone, but unless you have a friend willing to play this with you, there's no point in buying just for solo play as you will play through every arena in an hour.\n\nFinal Rating:\n5/10 - Buy it if you have friends who play it\n\nIf you liked this review please consider giving it a thumbs up and if you disliked post in the comments on why you disliked the review.\n\nFor more reviews follow Snort's Review curator page here - follow for regular updates on reviews for other games!","January 21","false","2.4"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","30","35","0","0"

Everything said in this review is subject to change.\n\nEpigenesis is a first person frantic shooter. The game was released on Steam as an early access game on November 1, 2013. Now you would expect an early access game that's only in its alpha stage, would have some issues but believe it or not, this game is pretty well set. This doesn't mean that the game is perfect, there are a few issues, but nothing that stops you from enjoying this game.\nSo what exactly is Epigenesis? Well its a first person shooter, but it has much more than your average shooter. Your main goal as the player is to grab the ball and throw it into the other teams gate. This then gives your team a point, as well as a power up. Power ups add let you modify the map. You can do all sorts of stuff including adding another path or causing a tornado. If somebody has the ball and they fall over the edge, but don't manage to pass it to another player, the ball resets. It is also possible to intercept the ball from the enemy. This makes the person who has the ball have a reason to score quickly. The game also has pickups which allow you to be more mobile. Now, if you have the ball, you're all set for the most part. Your main problem is not jumping to your death. Trying to shoot the enemy players when they have the ball is quite difficult. I found that using the rapid fire weapon was very ineffective, however, using the rail gun, I was able to get some shots on people. The game, currently, only has two weapons(as of 12/7/13). This is a little disappointing because a variety of weapons would add a variety of strategies. The rail gun itself does no damage, it can either push or pull somebody if you land a hit. The rapid fire gun is your damage dealing gun, but it's very difficult to hit somebody. The player can move quickly and unpredictably. This is both good and bad. Its good because it keeps you safe, but, its bad because if your shooting you had better be a good shot. This does add challenge and excitement to the game, especially when your able finally get a connected shot.\n\nEpigenesis adds different froms of challenge and fun through its unique maps. The maps are made up of a variety of floating\nsquare surfaces and building tops. You jump from panel to panel, trying to reach the ball first, usually is located in the center. Some maps offer launch pads which send you flying across the map and onto another panel(picture above shows a player being launched). This can be used as an escape route, and offensive route, or just extra fun. When you grab this ball, you can't shoot, so you have to rely on running. With the multiple pickups and launch pads, you can make your way to score a goal with no problem, that is until somebody gets a good shot on you and sends you off the map. But, if this happens, the ball and you simply re-spawn, after a short countdown, at the designated spots, and you continue playing.\n\nThe game only has one game mode(as of 12/7/13) which is to grab the ball and send it through the enemy’s gate. This still offers plenty of fun and hours of entertainment. Eventually though the same thing gets a bit old, but I feel that the developers will add more, remember the game is only in alpha. There is one problem that puts a damper on things, the lack of players. The game allows for 5v5 matches, however the biggest I have even been involved in is a 4v3. This, however, is not a permanent issue. I have only seen three servers on my game, but once the game is closer to actual release, there will more than likely be plenty of servers, and people. Most of the time I am able to get into a match that is 2v2. This does restrict what this game truly has to offer. If you have ever played Quake you will know that more people equals more fun. The developers were trying to make their own “Quake style” game.\n\nEpigenesis is something you should look out for. Unlike these new shooters that have been the same for the past 5 games, this game is unique and contains countless hours of fun. Since the game is only in alpha there are still many more advancements that can take place in this game. The good part about it being an early access game is that the developers will listen to the community and respond to what players say. If you love fast paced games like Quake, or just want to try something new, Eigenesis should be on your wishlist as soon as your done reading this review.\n\n\nfor more great reviews visit http://kingsjelly.tumblr.com/\n","December 7, 2013","true","5.4"," 44 of 59 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","44","59","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/youwonthegame/recommended/244590/","youwonthegame","Professor Cupcake","http://steamcommunity.com/id/youwonthegame/","341 products in account","With an already fantastic concept for a game, the developers of this have put so much effort into polishing its mechanics to perfection. With tight and satisfying movement, wonderful controls and very focussed design, this has the potential to be at the top of any list of arena shooters. It has a few major flaws however, chief among which is that it is quite badly explained and it takes a very long time to work out what is actually going on. It also has the incredibly unfortunate issue of having almost nobody playing it any more, which is a darn shame considering how amazing this game can be. You can still play it with bots, but the AI is too stiff to last more than a few matches before becoming boring. That said, the feeling of movement alone is what compelled me to keep playing for quite a while longer than the bots deserved.\n\nAnnoyingly, its only major flaw is something of a vicious cycle; there aren't enough people playing it, therefore nobody will play it, making the whole thing worse. At the time of writing, it is on sale for next to nothing; I urge anyone reading this to buy it, get a few friends to buy it too, try it out and share it as much as possible. Even if it isn't to your tastes, the best thing that can be done for this game right now is to be shared.","March 19, 2015","true","3.4"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","32","39","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nexiu/recommended/244590/","nexiu","Nexiu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nexiu/","274 products in account","Decent game with a poor community.\nEpigenesis is, in the world of science “the unfolding development in an organism, and in particular the development of a plant, fungus or animal from a seed, spore or egg through a sequence of steps in which cells differentiate and organs form”. Basically we’re talking about how plants grow.\n\nEpigenesis in the world of games however is a very different beast, but no less fascinating. It is a five-a-side sport of the future that blends basketball with bright, Tron-like neons and couples it with grotesque, map-devouring plants that can also shoot lasers. Yes, your sudden curiosity is deserved.\n\nOkay, It is time to discuss the most important things.\nGoal: The goal of Epigenesis is to take the ball from the middle of the level and throw it through the goal that is on the enemy’s side of the map. Simple, huh? Doing so will cause you to be sent back to your side of the map with a seed of your choice to go and plant somewhere on the level. Plants can only be planted on a platform that is either connected to another platform with a plant on it already, or your starting platform. You will win the match when you are able to plant a seed of any kind on the opponent’s starting platform.\n\nWeapons: Weapons are non lethal in Epigenesis, and will instead push or pull people depending on your setting in the customization screen. You can also punch people which will send them flying, and will also take the ball from them if they’re an enemy. This can be used to your advantage by pushing enemies off of platforms and giving your team a boost while they are in the air.\n\nJumping: Instead of just simply jumping, there’s a few differences to it in Epigenesis. It is possible to double jump at anytime, and there is even a chargeable jump that you can do at any time, and it is even possible to double jump with charged jumps as well.\n\nMaps: The maps that you will be playing on are basically a lot of platforms that are floating in the air along with larger platforms that allow the planting of seeds. Differences between maps are generally just the layout of the platforms, but some have mechanics about them that others don’t such as jump pads that will send you flying from one platform to another, or even a tornado that appears that will lift anyone up who passes through it.\n\nPowerups: Spread out on the maps you can find powerup spawners where you can pick up a one time use ability. You can save them to be used any time and there are three of them for you to use. A hook ability lets you shoot out a line that will attach itself to the ground around where you are aiming and will drag you to that spot. The speed boost ability will give you a sudden jolt of speed that will send you speeding away in the direction you are facing. A repulsion ability will bounce away all enemies that are surrounding you.\nSo it was not that sweetening the game at every turn, this game has one terrible drawback, not large community.\n\nSummary: Therefore the question arises whether you (read: me) should buy this game?\nYes, it definitely is worth the price. And if you have friends who are happy to play with you, persuade them to do the same.\n\nAlso, this game reminds me of the animated series, that calls itself Galactik Football, which of its time I loved.","July 31, 2015","true","2.7"," 27 of 33 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","27","33","0","0"

And if you like parkour and ball games, you'll like it even more. Even the tower defense fans will love this game!" ~~ProtoQuantum\n\nEpigenesis presents a promising take on the next few hundred years: no grim future centered entirely on war, no post-apocalyptic earth where Darwinian human instinct has taken over; instead, humanity created the most popular sport in history, some strange hybrid of Basketball, Soccer, and Unreal Tournament. It's also an interesting case for why "e-sports" doesn't necessarily have to conjure up images of multiplayer battle arenas and first-person shooters, but that more traditional (albeit fictional) sports can exist in that space alongside the likes of Dota 2 and Counter-Strike. I really like what Epigenesis represents: it's an innovative take on traditional sports that still provides the adrenaline rush of something like Quake or Unreal Tournament, in a well-produced package that you rarely see in games fresh out of Steam's Early Access.\n\n\n"In Epigenesis, two teams face off in an attempt to plant a ball inside an enemy's goal more times in ten minutes than the opposition across a platformed ravine. The arenas aesthetically resemble something out of Tron but play like something out of Quake. Each player is given a non-lethal laser with two modes: rail (an instant, focused beam which pushes enemies back a small amount) and shot (a mode which fires a missile-like projectile which travels slowly but produces an explosion that pushes back enemies a lot). The gun is a key part of both offense and defense -- pushing an enemy back and causing them to fall off a ledge or preventing them from landing on one in the first place spells instant death, producing a 5-second respawn timer. In addition, hitting an enemy who's in the air with your melee attack sends them straight downward, and if they fail to land on a platform? Splat.\n\nIn order to score a goal, a player has to pick up the ball from the middle of the arena, take it to the enemy goal, and toss it in. It's simple, but when presented with power-ups like "smokescreen" (which creates a cloud of smoke over a large area for a few seconds), along with arena-based hazards (like the desert maps' Twister, which pulls players it catches high up into the air), it gets complex and interesting. Upon scoring, a player is given a seed, which they can plant on one of the unoccupied platforms, which in turn spawns a plant, a kind of "turret" which produces effects ranging from firing projectiles which slow enemies, to creating a shield in which players can hide. In addition, each plant provides the entire team with a buff to either jump height or speed. Each player also has a gauntlet called a "meth-glove," whose use is two-fold: the first, called "methylation," allows a player to power up a plant; the other, called "demethylation," allows them to cause an enemy's plant to wither and eventually become inactive. It's here where the strategy of Epigenesis starts to shine: its rules are deceptively easy to learn, but when other humans are thrown into the mix, their collective strategies coalesce into something truly spectacular." ~~Tamriilin\n\n\nI can not say anything that has not been already said except for this THE COMMUNITY IS NOT DEAD!

And when I say "dead," I don't mean "there are a few full servers," I mean there are two or three people playing the multiplayer at any given time. It's disheartening, because playing against the AI only provides a challenge until you're out-thinking and out-pacing them, and with a complete lack of single-player campaign, its appeal only lasts for so long before you're wanting something richer. I only got to play a single match against real people, and it wasn't even a full house -- there were four people (two on each team) with the other six slots filled by AI. I'm sure that if I'd gotten to play more of the multiplayer component I would have enjoyed Epigenesis way more, but unfortunately, that's what often happens with Early Access titles: people play them obsessively for a few weeks or months and move on, and then when the game comes out nobody is still playing it.\n\nTHE VERDICT\n\nEpigenesis is a strong case for why e-sports doesn't necessarily have to be entirely composed of the likes of League of Legends and Unreal Tournament. It is, unfortunately, a product of the all-too-common disease I have taken to calling "Early Access Syndrome," in which a game's community is essentially non-existent on official release. I'd stay away unless you're buying the four-pack with the intention to play with other people you know, or are content playing against bots -- not because it's a bad game, but because the community just does not exist.","August 10, 2014","true","2.3"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

If anyone has played Halo Reach, Halo 3 or even just watched Red VS Blue, chances are you will ahve memories of Grifball. This is Grifball on steroids. This is everything you wanted out of Grifball. This is the Grifball standalone. But dont just think of this game as Grifball, this game has more potential than your mother ever thought you had. This game is early access so there are some bugs and some things to be improved such as including East and West US dedicated servers (This is being worked in but is hard as the game is based out of Europe). When people hear "Early Access Game" they think not ready or not enjoyable or possibly not even interesting. This proves those people wrong. The amasing thing about this game being Early Access is that it can only get better and go up from here.","February 1, 2014","true","2.4"," 14 of 19 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","14","19","0","0"

But, I cannot.\n\nI became enamored with the game over the free weekend. The sparsely populated servers with people as new and clueless as me made the game seem fun and the three-something dollar price tag appealing.\n\nOver the course of the next week or two the population disappeared. But I was able to learn the nuances of the game and navigate the not-steep, but completely unexplained, learning curve thanks to spotty appearances of other players. This made the game seem fun all over again. Over the following weeks I became comfortable with the game and really enjoyed the few times another human was actually on a server. Some players were better, a lot were as lost as I previously was.\n\nBut in the end, I never witnessed a game larger than 2v3. Morning, noon or night. Any day of the week. Any server from West to East to Europe to Asia. There just isn't people playing this game. Perhaps some games just shouldn't be open betas or 'Early Access'? People were done and bored before it had legs.\n\nOr perhaps other issues are really holding it back.\n\nThe learning curve isn't hard but requires other players to actually learn. There's documentation of what items do or how to prime your two jumps. But nothing about the useful ways to use the items, tactics to employ, using momentum from items/jumps/enemy fire, etc. All things you can only learn with a live enemy. And I still feel like I only really learned how to play 1v1 and what tactics to use in that situation because that's all I ever got to regularly.\n\nThe devs have an idea of what they believe gameplay *should* be like if you read around the web some. In the perfect world all the servers would be 5v5 and somebody would be playing "goalie" and people would pass the ball. Combine those Ideas with the game that really does feel smooth and man that sounds great!\n\nBut the dead community means you'll rarely see 5v5 or in my case; never. I tried to play "goalie" in a 2v2 after I had read about the concept on a forum. But it's just not a logical choice to do when you aren't realistically going to stop many chances.\n\nAnd passing? That would make the game that much more interesting but the speed of the players (especially once powerups are planted) makes that a colossal undertaking to time correctly. And because of this, nobody ever expects a pass. I never witnessed anybody else even attempt one.\n\nI could go on and on. Its a great concept that is fairly polished and fun in theory.. But has a dead community and suffers from a multitude of other problems. I could never recommend it even at the price I paid much less it's regular price. My twenty-plus hours of play consists of maybe five with other players and maybe three of those five hours was "competitive" play rather than goofing around. The vast majority of my play time was spent alone achievment whoring. The bots are awful.\n\nIf it gets lots of people suddenly, better maps (another issue I didn't delve into), and one or two other things I forgot to whine about... And it's like $0.99USD. MAYBE consider it.","June 12, 2014","false","21.3"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","10","12","0","0"

It does start with some wonky graphics settings, but after adjusting them it looks and plays pretty well, and many of the astetics (like the hideous alpha-style menus) will likely be fixed as more polish is added to the game.\n\nNow, onto the game itself. It remindes me a lot of a ball game mode from Unreal Tournament concept wise. It essentially uses shoot mechanics in a hoop and ball game similar to soccer (football), however it leans more heavely on the sports side of the shooter-sports hybrid. It is a high flying, high speed, and it does suffer a bit from a lack of feedback on landings and jump hieghts, but that forces you to pay attention to both the game and the platforms (I'd recomend using the highest FOV settings to help), as falling to your death is a constant threat. There are a lot of deep mechanics and power ups that make this game very strategic and competetive; It probably has the potental to compete with CS:GO's competitive scene.\n\nOver all, I would recomend this to someone who dislikes CoD style shooters but enjoyed the interesting gamemodes from old competitive games like Unreal Tournament, Counter Strike, and Quake Arena.","May 3, 2014","true","0.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Even though it is still in development and I only played it for a few hours on the free weekend event, I found it really fun and it gave me an amazing Quake feel. Do you remember those Quake maps filled with jump pads and death pits? Hell yes! The major problem I have with Epigenesis is with my ping, wich can be a pain in the *ss when I'm playing against people with 5 to 10 ping while mine is varying betwen 57 to 70. Besides that I can firmly say that every play you do in a match, whether it is a well timed jump, pushing somebody off of the platform, scoring for your team or whatever else you manage to do right, it is all super enjoyable and even when you do screw up it can be fun while not being heavily punished for it.

The actual game takes real skill, especially on PC?(easier if it was an Xbox game). Just trying not to fall off the map your first time is hard enough, let alone fight enemies at the same time. To put it simply, this game is like floating low gravity paintball with real guns. Okay, that sounds amazingly fun, and yes it would be, but this game doesn't pull that off as well as they might like to. I still can't quite get the sight to shoot to hit technique down. Not sure if the bullet insta-hits or if it travels to hit them while they move. It's a mess, but when you play with bots or experienced players, they have no problem! The game is actually pretty good, unique, interesting, and fun when you get the hang of it. I would say it is worth the money, especially on sale.

The graphics and the sounds effect on the game are without a doubt amazing. All the sound effect on this game makes us feel like a badass. Strong music with violent effect really feels awesome!\n\nThe biggest issue of this game, which puts this game with a score of 8/10, is the community. In fact, when I bought the game and wanted to play online the community was inexistent. Not even a single server had 1 player in it, I was playing alone on all of those servers. Watching all those vid seemed like the game was HUGE, but really it's not that big and in fact one of the smallest community I have ever seen. Hopefully, the community will grow and we will be able to play a real 6v6 match.\n\nDespite the fact that theres not a bunch of weapon variety, this game is fun to play with all the weapons. The maps seems ok but I couldn't really appreciate it at there full potential since the lack of the cummunity. Seeds how ever, are an amazing aspect of this game, making the maps customizable and also allowing player to create some fun strategies throughout the game.\n\nIn the end, the game is really promissing, really fun to play. But the only way to really appreciate the game would be having a larger community. I recommend this game to any fps player who love a challenging game.","July 24, 2014","true","0.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Two small teams bouncing around platforms, struggling to pay attention to the other players as the beautiful maps distract so easily.  Then you see some plants popping up on platforms around you as players start scoring.  Hold on, plants? in a future sports first-person shooter?!  Yep and they are what makes the game something really truly unique.  Each plant provides actual physical objects that either buff such as speed boosts, air control, shields, they provide new ledges (actually changing the playing area), turrets, mortars, and more!  The game already feels really unique as you could coordinate a variety of different team playstyles but I am just imagining even more plants and drooling at the mouth with the variety! The sweet juicy variety!\n\nThis game is really original and fun it just needs more players!  Get on this weekend, log in to a server.  There will be tons of people playing on Saturday and Sunday for sure!

A good place to start for people new to first person shooters, as it will give you an unobstructed view as you learn to lead moving targets, and where to aim when you are also moving.  There's plenty here for more advanced shooters too.  You will need to formulate strategies against a continuously moving foe in order to advance the ball and hopefully, eventually score. For the defending side its a matter of preventing the other team from scoring, and gaining control of the ball for your team. There are several different races to choose from, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages all of which need to be taken into account as you advance the ball or try to take it from your opponent.\n\nThe game can be played either solo or online. If playing solo you will be playing the lower level games against two bots and will have one bot as a team mate. If you play online you will be matched with players of similar ability to the degree that is possibe (during off hours there may not be a very large pool of people available and the ability levels of opponents may become quite disperate).\n\nI can't say that this game will be for everyone, if it becomes available for a free weekend then definitely give it a go, or if it goes on sale and you are a fan of FPS and of team sport, then definitely drop the cash for this one.","May 4, 2014","true","0.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's strategic action, it's truly a sport with original (as far as I've seen) game mechanics, and it avoids feeling like a team deathmatch that has Those-Objectives-That-Mean-Nothing. Pick up the ball from the center and throw it through the enemy's gate, and you earn a seed to customize. Bring it safely to an uncaptured node, and you will earn a team bonus and a structure of your choosing.\n\nPersonally, I prefer ramps with an air control team bonus (Option 2 of Loadout 1) so that my teammates and I have vantage points, can advance across the field faster, can dodge and pursue enemies better, and avoid falling as often. And I really want extreme air control with ramps everywhere, so I focus on the objective and work with people. That way I can separate myself from multiple pursuers if I run back to my side of the field, take a ramp, and change direction to fool the remainder who anticipate the ramp getting used. Oh, best part yet? Take a seed to the enemy's gate with a neighboring node under your control, and you will instantly win the game for your team.\n\nFun? Yes. Recommended? Yes. I'd join the official Epigenesis group if you're looking to buy it; a little community effort and a few new friends should help keep your games full and interesting.","May 2, 2014","true","10.6"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

There is a single player mode however, so if there's not people on you can battle against AI.\n\nThe second thing somewhat bad is the controls, they feel a tad unresponsive at times, including jumping, but other than it being unresponsive at times, the characters do control mostly smoothly.\n\nNow on to the good.\n\nThe graphics are pretty good, and I can run it at 60fps without turning much down as far as detail. Although I do have more than the recommended PC specs. At times on larger, more detailed maps, it will dip down in to the 50s or 40s, but it doesn't last long.\n\nThe idea is good, and pretty well executed. It's kind of like Super Smash Bros. without the percentage building up, and in a 3D environment + basketball. You have weapons that knock people all over the place, including in the air, off ledges, and down in to the abyss. You also have a goal, which is to get the ball and throw it in to the enemies base (or hoop) and get points, the enemy is doing the same of course, so it leads to a pretty even match.\n\nEach map is timed, if you get more points than the other team by the time limit, you win. HOWEVER, that's not the only way to win. Every time you score a goal you get a seed, which you can use to plant something that can help you and your team out, in the set positions you can plant it in. If you, or your team plants every plant in their spot, you'll also win by that.\n\nI got this game while it was on sale, and got the 4-pack for $2.49, but I would highly recommend it regardless of the price.\n\nAll in all, this is a good game if you've got friends to play with. If not, you may get bored of fighting against the AI all the time, but it still offers and enjoyable experience if someone joins your game, or if you join a game in progress.","March 20, 2015","true","2.3"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

But that won't be easy because a bunch of angry men are running at you firing lasers and trying to punch you, turrets are shooting huge projectiles right in your face and some tornados are here to bring pain and misery. Yep, it's not 2k14.\nThat game is pretty similar to quake or unreal. You can double jump, you can find bonus on the ground (blink, grab, pushback aoe etc), you are firing rockets and lasers. Jumping is the key of the game, the arenas are made of platforms and you to have to jump from one to another, there is no real ground. That means that you can fall and die really often if you fail your jumps.\nWeapons are pretty original, the first one fires rocket that'll push your ennemys away or pull them to you, the second one is a laser that stops instantly the ennemy movement (really effective when shooting a men while he is in the air, he'll fall to death). You also get a construction laser.\nYes a construction laser! When a player scores, he gains a seed. This seed can be used on the biggest platforms to create a bonus. These bonus consist of turrets, mortars, ramps, shields, smokescreen and trench. Each of these bonus will help your team to win, choose them wisely because they can change the battlefield a lot. Each of these contructions also brings you a passiv bonus like an acceleration boost, a higher fire rate etc. But be carefull because the other team can destroy them and make you loose the bonus.\n\nI really enjoyed it, it's not bug free but it's pretty solid at what it does.

That's it... That's all it is.\nIt doesn't seem as though the multiplayer works and if it does, nobody plays it but the the game is fun enough on singleplayer so there really is no need for multiplayer to work (Unless you really want to play with your friend/s).\nThe game iself can be enjoyed even for those who don't enjoy sports games.\n\nThe main goal of the game is to get the ball into the other teams 'goal' and keeping them away from you in the process. You can do this by using the gun that you are given at the start of the match.\nThe gun knocks people back so you can use it to protect other members of your team, yourself or just to push people off og the platforms.\nEach time a player scores they are given a seed to plant (Odd, i know) which you put on a platform to capture it and the game continues until time is up (I think).","August 23, 2015","true","1.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Sadly not many people play the game but the fact that someone has gone out and taken the time to make a sporty arena shooter is enough to make me happy. Hopefully we will see the game completed and rise in popularity but what I am especially hope for is that people start making more arena shooters.","January 31, 2014","true","8.3"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

Even the main menu is laggy and it's not because of my computer. There is very little direction as what to do, despite a tutorial. Most maps are unplayable due to the fact that every player has the same gun and it's far too difficult to manuever. Additionally the live voice action in the game sounds like an untrained swedish individual garbling through a soda can into a potato on a stick microphone. There is literally no worse way to spend money unless you're trying to sieze your brain through epilectic shock and poor gameplay mechanics.

Sports games are underrepresented, especially on PC, and there are even fewer examples of games that use the theoretical gaming environment to present a new conceptual sport. This hybrid extreme rugby / gridiron football / dodge ball / gymnastics / etc -type of challenge is really an entertaining concept.\n\nUnfortunately, the gameplay is clunky and lags graphically too often, and especially at critical times, it seems.\n\nCould be a 9+, but due to the mediocre controls and glitchy action it is hard to hate or love in any definitive manner.\nMeh.

When designing a multiplayer game, of any sort, one of the most vile and hated things that can happen is the "Roll" as it were. Now, what you do not do is make a game where the enemy team, provided sufficient advantage, is rewarded by rolling with more and more benefits to the point that it is difficult to ever recover from said roll. Provided, I never got to that point.\n\nI just spent the most frustrating eight minutes of my life simply trying to get to the center platform to get the ball. The rest of my team spent their time running about with a chicken with their head cut off and the enemy team wasn't much better. THey were only winning because they figured out a route that basically there's very little chance to stave them off of. There's a boost platform that throws them directly into the goal, yet no counter boost platform. Closest one lands you three platforms away. So basically it means you need someone to stand there and guard... of course the person standing still will just get hit and thrown off the platform. The game is schizo about its speed, alternating between me sitting with my thumb up my ♥♥♥ to get the three power blocks of jump to get anywhere, and rushing about to try to stop the enemy ball carrier. I wasn't even mad the enemy team was winning. I was just getting annoyed of the booster blocks kept not working and the majority of time I spent playing could be classified as flailing hopeless against fate and waiting for my jump to charge. Also the jump charging is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and the game should just fix it to three-power basic. 75% of the platforms in the map I was on couldn't be reached WITHOUT three power, so what's the point of lower powers if they don't provide you anything but schmuck bait?\n\nAlso thanks for the how to do that tells me I have two weapons without telling me how to swap them.","May 2, 2014","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game actually is not action, it's FPS Sport. This game is different than other FPS multiplayer that gives player freedom to choose scoring a goal or taking down opponent. Unfortunately there's just 2 map available in this game, but all of them have a great design and colorfull. Now about gameplay, Player starting in their side playing as Omani or Argos, after time countdown player now can leave their base and begin the match. In the match killikng/taking down other opponent won't give you additional score but it give you advantages to hold the ball and score a goal easily. In every base there are a ring, player must throw the ball there to score a goal.

Until then, this game is dead. You can be alone in the arena, or 1 vs 1, at least the best game I had was 2 vs 2, and that's when the game goes fun, charm and entertaining.\n\nIs a great game concept, that is focused to at least 2 vs 2, and that's when the game is perfect. But with just 2 players per arena, is kinda messy. And that's the problem, having about 8 arenas in where to play, and see in about 3/4 of them as 0/10 players, just dissapointing.\n\nThat's all, as I said, unless the game rises up it's own popularity as the RAZER's Giveaway, or, you can manage to play with about you and three more friends.

My oh my! looking at the concept and the video i thought to myself, "why not try it out?" If you love quake and Unreal Tournament type of games,this should be a piece of cake for you xD. Swopping like a hawk you take the ball and chuck it at the opponent's post. Looks like Quidditch but no brooms :/. I'd suggest you guys to try it out but it's still in early access :P so not to get your hopes too high...but its worth playing it atleast :D\nHands down to the audio dept! Perfect music for a fast thrilled match and makes me serious while playing.\nAll the best guys :D i hope this game would turn out what you hoped to accomplish!","April 17, 2014","true","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This is recommended.\n\nPros\n-No games like it.\n-Fast paced\n-Sci-fi type\n-Powerups to save yourself, or mess with others\n-Nice graphics\n-Updated fairly frequently\n-Bots to play against. And not terrible AI either, pretty good.\n-Some achievements\n-3 different loadout (only tried 1 though)\n\nCons\n-NOBODY is online unless either devs announce they, or you bring a friend\n-Menus are a tad bit ugly\n-No effective passing to teammates? Its a huge fluke if you grab a ball in mid air with your laser gun.\n-Lags on my comp (thats just my problem :P)\n\nOverall it's a very promising game. Ten bucks is a reasonable price, that is ONCE they get a good amount of the servers filled up. I'd still recommend buying it now, but don't expect to see many other people online right as you open it. I've met 2 only so far.","April 20, 2014","true","2.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Genuinely not enough players to do this game justice.  This is one of the most exciting, satisfying, and downright fun games I've played in my many many years as a gamer.  If I were asked to describe it, it's basically space Quidditch if you were to throw in a splash of Unreal Tournament and Tribes: Ascend.\n\nThe object is to take control of the ball placed in the center of the field and get it into the opposing team's goal, which then rewards you with a seed that you can plant on a platform adjacent to either your own goal, or a platform on which you've already planted a seed, which will then give a stat buff of your choosing to your entire team (Speed, Jump height, etc) and will also create a plant with abilities such as shielding or energy turrets which are activated (or deactivated by the enemy) using your meth (methylation) glove.  The game is won either by the team with the most goals when the timer runs out, or by the first team to plant a seed on the opposing team's goal.\n\nAmong the tools you have to accomplish these objectives are:\n- An energy blaster, which has a short travel time and can knock opponents or the ball around, messing up their trajectories or assisting passes to teammates.\n- A hitscan beam shot with a slower rate of fire and reduced repulsive capability.\n- Various powerups scattered across certain platforms in the playing field, such as Boost (gives you a big push in the direction you're aiming), Grapple (sends a grappling hook in the direction of your crosshair, which pulls you in that direction), and Push (generates a small explosion around you, pushing away other players. I'm unsure of the official name), among others.\n\nI VERY much recommend this game, as a gamer and as a critic.  It's something relatively innovative in the way it implements the features and mechanics it uses, isn't very hard to get into after a few rounds, and is simply a LOT of fun, plus it's very cheap for the entertainment value, plus it runs at very high and wonderfully smooth framerates on most modern machines, and can be turned down to run just fine even on some older ones so more people can enjoy what this game has to offer.  As well, it's non-violent, so parents who are mindful of what their kids play, or just don't like violence will be happy to know that the game doesn't have a health or damage system, deaths, or blood, just pure clean fun.\n\nI'd give it a 9/10\n\nTL;DR - You won't regret buying this game.","February 20, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first i didn't have a clue what was going on and there were a few bugs i came across. One that i can remember was that i could only chat using enter and that was to "all" so i couldn't just talk to my team (tried changing controls but to no avail) That was only a minor glitch and didn't really effect the fun i had. Once i got used to the jumping mechanics and worked out the loadout system i.e. what plants to choose, what they are all about and how important they are to getting an advantage over the other team i really got into it. When new players came in to a game i did find myself having to explain all that i'd worked out about the game, like what plants do, the fact that you had to power them up after planting them etc. I felt it my duty in the interest of fair play to also tell new players that you could power down the other teams plants and distroy them by planting your own in their place. This i did kind of reluctantly but as i said it wouldn't have been fair if i hadn't passed this crucial info on. ANYWAY... Great game, simple and very addictive plus it's one of those games that take you a while to really master (more time than i had playing it) which is NOT a bad thing. Looking forward with interest to see how the game progresses as work continues on it. Get it now though as it's still totally playable in it's current state. One warning i would put out there is that after a while playing you may suffer from a sore thumb from all the jumping (using space), but that may have just been me. :)","February 11, 2014","true","11.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

When designing a multiplayer game, of any sort, one of the most vile and hated things that can happen is the "Roll" as it were. Now, what you do not do is make a game where the enemy team, provided sufficient advantage, is rewarded by rolling with more and more benefits to the point that it is difficult to ever recover from said roll. Provided, I never got to that point.\n\nI just spent the most frustrating eight minutes of my life simply trying to get to the center platform to get the ball. The rest of my team spent their time running about with a chicken with their head cut off and the enemy team wasn't much better. THey were only winning because they figured out a route that basically there's very little chance to stave them off of. There's a boost platform that throws them directly into the goal, yet no counter boost platform. Closest one lands you three platforms away. So basically it means you need someone to stand there and guard... of course the person standing still will just get hit and thrown off the platform. The game is schizo about its speed, alternating between me sitting with my thumb up my ♥♥♥ to get the three power blocks of jump to get anywhere, and rushing about to try to stop the enemy ball carrier. I wasn't even mad the enemy team was winning. I was just getting annoyed of the booster blocks kept not working and the majority of time I spent playing could be classified as flailing hopeless against fate and waiting for my jump to charge. Also the jump charging is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, and the game should just fix it to three-power basic. 75% of the platforms in the map I was on couldn't be reached WITHOUT three power, so what's the point of lower powers if they don't provide you anything but schmuck bait?\n\nAlso thanks for the how to do that tells me I have two weapons without telling me how to swap them.","May 2, 2014","false","0.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also, when you shoot the ball, the enemy takes it, which makes you frustrated.\nLittle players - There were lots of players in the Free Play Weekend, but now, I don't see anybody in Multiplay servers.

Genuinely not enough players to do this game justice.  This is one of the most exciting, satisfying, and downright fun games I've played in my many many years as a gamer.  If I were asked to describe it, it's basically space Quidditch if you were to throw in a splash of Unreal Tournament and Tribes: Ascend.\n\nThe object is to take control of the ball placed in the center of the field and get it into the opposing team's goal, which then rewards you with a seed that you can plant on a platform adjacent to either your own goal, or a platform on which you've already planted a seed, which will then give a stat buff of your choosing to your entire team (Speed, Jump height, etc) and will also create a plant with abilities such as shielding or energy turrets which are activated (or deactivated by the enemy) using your meth (methylation) glove.  The game is won either by the team with the most goals when the timer runs out, or by the first team to plant a seed on the opposing team's goal.\n\nAmong the tools you have to accomplish these objectives are:\n- An energy blaster, which has a short travel time and can knock opponents or the ball around, messing up their trajectories or assisting passes to teammates.\n- A hitscan beam shot with a slower rate of fire and reduced repulsive capability.\n- Various powerups scattered across certain platforms in the playing field, such as Boost (gives you a big push in the direction you're aiming), Grapple (sends a grappling hook in the direction of your crosshair, which pulls you in that direction), and Push (generates a small explosion around you, pushing away other players. I'm unsure of the official name), among others.\n\nI VERY much recommend this game, as a gamer and as a critic.  It's something relatively innovative in the way it implements the features and mechanics it uses, isn't very hard to get into after a few rounds, and is simply a LOT of fun, plus it's very cheap for the entertainment value, plus it runs at very high and wonderfully smooth framerates on most modern machines, and can be turned down to run just fine even on some older ones so more people can enjoy what this game has to offer.  As well, it's non-violent, so parents who are mindful of what their kids play, or just don't like violence will be happy to know that the game doesn't have a health or damage system, deaths, or blood, just pure clean fun.\n\nI'd give it a 9/10\n\nTL;DR - You won't regret buying this game.","February 20, 2015","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I received a free Steam key for this game online, and it activated and installed without any trouble. Two complaints, however:\n\n1) When in full screen (this must be manually toggled), resolutions higher than about 720p are not available. I realize 4K games may be out-of-range for some, but surely not 1080p?\n\n2) I found the planting mechanic a little odd when juxtaposed with the high-tech theme of the rest of the game. Perhaps the contrast was intended, but I think it would flow a little better if towers were constructed rather than large plants.\n\nAll in all, a good game.

I was able to find lobbies that were higher than 4 players (probably due to the recent offer from Razer), but I find this game leaving me wanting more out of it. There are definitely some gameplay mechanics that need improvement, but the idea is solid, and most importantly, it's fun. A few other people in my gaming clan have also taken a liking to this game, and it's great to play with people you know.\n\nI think that if this game were to get more attention, it would, as a result, instill regular updates and fixes and changes to the game. Hopefully this game can nab the spotlight and reel in the players it needs.\n\nThis game is fun, it's a great idea, solid concept, and is definitely worth playing (even if it's just for 30 minutes).","July 31, 2015","true","1.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
