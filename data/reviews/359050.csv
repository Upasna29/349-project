Now that i'm 22 years old i've always felt as if something was missing in my life. This game has filled the void.\n\nEdit: For those who are unaware, my goal is to hit 10,000 hours within the game, because then, by Gladwell's standards I have mastered showering with my Dad.","November 8, 2015","true","286.7"," 2,152 of 2,292 people (94%) found this review helpful 2,021 people found this review funny","94","152","2","021","126"

Why not?\n\nI'll start off by issuing a warning that if you have epilepsy, take all games seriously or you just can't handle pixelated nudity then steer very clear of this, it's not for you.\n\nDeveloped and published by Marbenx, let's take a look at Shower with your Dad Simulator 2015.\n\nGameplay: As difficult as it is to write about; Shower With Your Dad Simulator 2015 is a series of actually challenging mini-games(e.g Endurodad, Dadathon, Dad Divisions, Soapia etc.), topped with pixely nudity, all kinds of dads and a rather addicting streak to it.\n\nMenu: Extremely simplistic, but done in a decent way. The only thing that I dislike is that if you hit escape, the game will close on you.\n\nSoundtrack: Each mini-game has it's own soundtrack that is looped in a pretty non-annoying way even after a decent amount of play time, and it's actually good!\n\nFinal Conclusion: I found myself getting frustrated time and again over the curve-balls it will sometimes throw you. Something as tiny as a puddle on the floor will have you slide into the wrong dad and make you start over, or lose your streak(depending on which mode you're in). It's a nice challenge that by no means takes itself seriously and I think that's what I enjoy most about it.\n\nIt keeps you trying that one more time to beat your previous score, that is the sign of a well put together game for entertainment.\n\nIn all, I recommend it if you like simplistic yet fairly difficult games to keep you on your toes. Also if you like Showering with Dad simulators, nudity, showers and pixely goodness.","October 27, 2015","true","2.7"," 281 of 317 people (89%) found this review helpful 36 people found this review funny","89","281","317","36","0"

Shower With Your Dad Simulator 2015: Do You Still Shower With Your Dad is, for the most part, a joke game. It's a parody. Several times throughout the... "narrative"... the game makes fun of the fact that it even was able to get greenlit. However, the fact that it's a joke game does NOT make it a bad game.\n\nMany people seem to compare the game to disasters such as Air Control and Zen Fish Sim, which in my opinion, is simply not fair.  Those games were made as scams to intentionally deceive users. This game is not a "scam." It was made to entertain, and it's really one of the funniest games I've played in a very long time. And I'm not talking about laughing at how bad it is.\n\nOthers may choose to compare it to Goat Simulator and I am Bread. And I will agree, that is a somewhat fair comparison. I am Bread and Goat Simulator are both "joke" games, which SWYDS2K15:DYSSWYD certainly falls under. However, there are a few factors to consider here. One, the price. SWYDS2K15:DYSSWYD costs $0.99 cents, while the former two cost more than $9.00. Two, the quality of the actual games. SWYDS2K15:DYSSWYD is actually funny, unlike the other two. This isn't a "one joke" game. It's a "multi-joke" game. There's various things that will make you laugh and appreciate the humor. Plus, there's more game modes than shown in the trailers. In fact, it's basically a shout out to Frog Fractions.\n\nKeeping in mind that the game is funny, well crafted, and costs what basically amounts to something you can find spending 5 minutes in a laundromat, I believe I can safely recommend this game to people looking for a good and enjoyable joke/parody game.","September 8, 2015","true","4.8"," 92 of 104 people (88%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","88","92","104","9","0"

Thanks for making society a better place marbenx!\n\n<3","September 28, 2015","true","3.8"," 176 of 228 people (77%) found this review helpful 175 people found this review funny","77","176","228","175","6"

Packed with silly humor, lame jokes and woefully-primitive gameplay, it somehow manages to be better than the sum of its parts. The first time I booted this game, I sat smiling like an idiot at the title screen, which combines cheap 90s-era graphics with a song that sounds like it was ripped from the soundtrack to In Living Color.\n\nThere isn't much variation to the gameplay - a handful of different "shower modes" (pick the right dad while avoiding obstacles, dodging falling dads or going for a time attack mode) - but it's all so stupidly simplistic and knowingly cheesy that it somehow becomes amusing. The black father sometimes disappears on occasion, there are random glitches and you should be able to get most of the achievements in an hour or two.\n\nYet, in spite of that, you could do a whole lot worse for a dollar. Buy it for the music, knowingly-cheesy throwbacks, stay for the lame humor and strangely addicting gameplay.\n\n(Fun Fact: I was going to make a male anatomy joke in the last sentence, but thought better of it.

You play as 1 of three kids trying to make his way over to his dad, avoiding puddles, wet floor signs, and other, not so friendly dads.\n\n\n\n\nThe game is separated into 7 game types, each more ridiculous as the last. Some game modes are locked and unlocked over time, by playing the basic modes. The 2 basic modes, are similar, the first one, you pick your kid and have to race to your dad to add more time, as well as get more points. The second gamemode, you are assigned a random kid, and have to get to that kids, dad, thus adding time, and adding points.\n\n\n\nAs 2D the game is, it holds its own, graphically speaking. Everything that appears, like obstacles or powerup, are all very clear to the player. The rubber duck looks like a rubber duck, and the wet floor sign looks like a wet floor sign.

That something is that you are willing to play anything if it was gifted to you, no matter the social ramifications of having "Showering with Dad" achievements blasted across your profile.\n\nI would also like to commend the makers of this game for the ethnic diversity of the dads portrayed. The game comes with three default races of White, Black, and Irish.\n\nHowever, I was a little disappointed in the realism. I was expecting a bit more out of a "simulator". It wasn't very realistic at all. I've personally never seen more than two dads in one shower room at a time, and the opening rounds of the game clearly have at least three. Plus, how do they know the other "dads" were actually dads at all?\n\nThe story is also quite terrible. When you accidently shower with a wrong "dad", the game ends. What happens next? The devs completely abandoned any effort of tell the real story here. The story of hundreds of shower rooms filled with a somewhat ethnically diverse group of pseudo dads who may or may not be showing with their own children.\nAs someone mentioned before, this game was destined for a co-op mode. Way to leave money on the table devs.\n","September 6, 2015","true","0.1"," 35 of 45 people (78%) found this review helpful 33 people found this review funny","78","35","45","33","0"

In no time you will be uncovering new or old feelings for your dad that may previously have been confusing. There is a distinct variety of dads in the game however, one day I hope mod support is introduced to let the true spirit of the simulator to be unleashed and more scenarios, game modes and desirable dads be uncovered.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/recommended/359050/","maudish","Audish","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maudish/","908 products in account","I think everyone has played at least one game that tried way too hard to be funny. For me, that's something like McPixel or Retro City Rampage. Shower With Your Dad Simulator 2015: Do You Still Shower With Your Dad is the opposite of that, a game so earnest about its uncomfortable, almost-homoerotic premise that you can't help but like it. The game commits to it as hard as it can, focusing all 6+ of its modes entirely around showering with your dad. And remarkably, beneath the polished madness of its presentation, is a solid and often surprising game.\n\nSWYDS2015:DYSSWYD is a collection of minigames, each like a fleshed-out WarioWare microgame. You start with three unlocked, and can unlock the rest by playing the game, though the means by which you unlock them are mysterious and delightful on their own. The first mode, Endurodad, has you playing one of three children in a timed search for his depurating (yes I used a thesaurus for that) father. Controlling the tot with just the arrow keys, you run him right into his dad to earn extra time and build your Dadstreak. If you hit the wrong dad, showertime ends. Every time you tag the right dad, the assorted bathers and obstacles are re-randomized, making it a hectic dash back and forth through the shower room. There are wet floor signs that slow you, puddles that send you skidding away, and more and more dads to confuse you as you go. The second mode, Dadathlon, is similar, except every time you find the right dad you switch to a different kid, and each individual search is timed. Finding the wrong dad only gives you less time on the next search. Both modes have very steady difficulty curves that you can overcome with time. There are also power-ups to unlock such as soap, beer, and rubber duckies, but I would be lying if I said I understood what most of them did. They certainly spice up the gameplay, which is enough for me.\n\nThe third mode, Dad Divisions, is a pretty big departure. Instead of freely scooting around the showers, your child is stuck running left and right, catching falling showering dads. Mouse click extends his naked arm in bionic fashion to snatch dads from the air, and the up arrow changes what kid you are so you can match them to the right dad. It feels like an intense puzzle game and makes a nice break from the other two modes. There are more modes beyond these but I'll not spoil them for you, for their discovery is a major reason to play the game at all. I will say that while they offer dramatically different gameplay, they have certain flaws that the base three modes do not suffer from. Still, their discovery and variety add a lot to the overall package. On top of all that, there are some microgames that randomly pop up in between rounds that can range from quicktime events to... stranger things.\n\nAs a game, Shower With Your Dad Simulator 2015 is a dense package to explore that will easily last you a few hours if you let it. The presentation only adds to the charm, being a weird cross between 8-bit homage and Hotline Miami visual weirdness. Every game starts with a dad joke, and the low-res genitalia cannot and will not be censored (seriously, try it in the options). For the price you absolutely cannot go wrong, because this is the rarest of games, the one that is built around a single joke and makes it work.","September 19, 2015","true","1.6"," 29 of 35 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","29","35","0","0"

Then, I sit down and use my special poop chopping butter knife that I keep in my vanity drawer to cut it all up and dissect it. It's very interesting to find out which part of the poop is which meal because some things don't really digest fully, such as mushrooms, some beans, tomatoes, venlafaxine pills (this is how I can exactly tell which meal is which bit because I take my dose at exactly the same time each day) and I can work it out because sometimes there is no venlafaxine pills (they just look exactly the same except slightly yellow) in the poop that it takes normally longer than 24 hours for the food to go from your mouth to become poop, although it varies quite a lot and sometimes (because I take two pills a day) there will be 4 pills and then I know it took two days at least (constipation) and my record is 6 pills but that was when I was taking morphine so at least three days from mouth to ♥♥♥ which is quite a long time. Sometimes, the poop is very very hard and it separates into little pellet balls which I think means I am dehydrated even though I drink tonnes of water and other times it is diarrhea which means I'm sick. Then I become very paranoid about clooging the drain and someone finding what I am doing so that's why I then have to chop it up very very very fine and smush it with the knife. Then, I put the shower on still sitting down and do a gold panning sort of thing with the water so all the small bits slowly go down the drain leaving the larger ones to be chopped up by me. After all of that I then have a normal shower and scrub the floor and my body with antibacterial soap.","November 14, 2015","true","0.1"," 38 of 53 people (72%) found this review helpful 30 people found this review funny","72","38","53","30","7"

It doesn't really work that well on Windows 10. It starts up with a borderless window that is probably 200x800 and over half of the thing is missing. You then have to navigate your mouse to the settings to see that enhancing the game size is F3 ... Fair enough, you enhance it so it fits your screen (In my case 1920x1080) and then the game crashes. (At least it did for me)\nI then opened the game again and it was 1920x1080 and fullscreen, good.\nThe buttons on the main screen flash so much that if hurts your eyes. Epileptic people can easily get a seizure from it.\n\nOnto the gameplay, it's very simplistic. A few game modes where you either need to catch the right dad or you need to run to the right dad on a timer. You're done with the game after 3 minutes... Yes. Three minutes.\nI know there's things I "missed" however, I can easily guess what those things are.\n(I had to have the game running for a couple of minutes more just to write this review)\n\nI will say though, the music in this game is great, especially the menu music.

My  companion Nick had gifted me this strange piece of electronic entertainment. As soon as I saw the title my mind started to race and the ignominy of yesteryear started crawling back into the recesses of my skull. I was 4 years old again searching for my hung father amidst the public showers at the local community pool. I was lost admidst the current of astray fathers, looking for my brithgiver. the inviting  but intoxicating  aura of shower steam  fogged my perception as my soap stinged eyes did not help the matter at hand. Following the scent of my father's Gilette Aftershave, I crawled and clawed along the wet and moist tile floors astrewn with stray soap clumps and pubic hair.                                                                             Eventually, I saw the light at the end of the tunnel, Large father was  maxing and relaxing at the stall at the end of the shower chamber. I was sure that was my patriarch, I recognized the leg hair spiral on both of his calves.  His Toenails were filled to the brim with chunks of Dove(tm) men's soap. he promised me when we got home  I could lick his squeaky clean toes. I got excited thinking  about that. It usually  brightens up our father-son bonding time while we play scrabble and monopoly (Spongebob edition <3). I opened the shower curtain and I was taken aback  by the sight of another large daddy. This father  had different colored hair and a handlebar mustache that said " I Mean Business" . He stared me down as i cowered in the corner and he proclaimed "whats wrong  sugarplum, can you not find your daddy?". Terrified, I sprinted towards the exit of the shower  chamber. The walls  felt they were closing in on me and would squeeze me until i was a 1x2 clean Yung Ceed of a boy. I soon found my daddy peruzing the automobile magazines by the cashier's shelf at the gift shop. "What were you doing in there young Jetty" he said, "Getting dirty with the daddies?". Embarassed and filled with fear i soon felt at ease meeting my large father. Moral of the story: DONT SHOWER WITH A FALSE FATHER\n\n","December 19, 2015","true","0.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","89","16","18","16","2"

The weapon progression is very impressive and the graphics look so damn good they made my jaw drop. I cannot run this on anymore than medium with my dual titan Xs, but I am happy with that.\n\nUntil about 911 hours in, I noticed the multiplayer feature on the menu. I thought to myself: "Wow, such a hardcore single player game has multiplayer? Let's check it out!" I loaded into a game. There were roughly 1,392,520 screaming Russian children in the lobby, calling me a 'noob team', and a 'ckya'. One guy in the lobby told me that he would get a plane to England and smack my face on the keyboard.

Sometimes, when reloading a level, you have a minigame to play.\n\nEndurodad is the first mode you can try. In it, you choose your pair between three fathers and their kids. Your goal is to reach your dad before the time's out. But if you're showering with the wrong one, it's the end of the round too! Many powerups can appear on the screen: a beer, while not perfect to see, is at least slowing time, the adventure map changes your dad during a limited time, another one is making you have two dads (which means less chance to end up wrong). The more you're scoring, the more complicated it will be: dads being curtains, dads being added, signs slowing you, puddles making you slide, etc..\n\nDadathlon is based on the same mechanics than Eurodad, apart that you're not choosing your dad: each time, the kid is changing, so it's up to you to find the right one.\n\nDad Divisions is a mode where the dads are falling down. You need to get them before they touch the ground. But to make sure you don't take the wrong one, you'll have to change the kid.\n\nSoapico is a point-&-click adventure (not taking long) where your dad is an investigator and is trying to find what happened.\n\nThe Dad With the Iron Shower is a mode where you need to avoid three ninjas kids and any object thrown at you by the Ninja Daddy.\n\nInglorious Bathdads is a mode where the kid is in a flying tube and has to touch the tube where his dad is. You can also gun down the others.\n\nThat's the content of the game. In reality, the fun comes because you're challenged, either by the achievements or by trying to beat your score.\n\nBut it's the humor in it and the fact that it's a parody of a simulator that makes the game very enjoyable. The powerups are not quite recommended for kids - I think about the beer for example. I also appreciated the two dads option, because it's making the job easier and also because of the symbolism of it being included.\n\nThe graphics are in the wave of retro gaming: it's pixelised and it's probably a way to avoid criticism about sex as the kids and the dads are naked. So, yeah, there is the equipement between the legs being pictured.\n\nThe soundtrack is also good. It's a joy to hear it during your games.\n\nSo yeah, Shower With Your Dad Simulator may be cheap but the fun provided in it is real. You make a real bargain here. Don't hesitate at all!","February 17","true","5.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","2"

It's an experience. A visual masterpiece. Art.\n\nShower With Your Dad Simulator addresses the many underlying complexities of human nature and our existential angst. Why are we here? What is beauty? Is there a divine creator? Why does Daddy's peepee get bigger when he makes me lather him? This work of art stops at nothing. It challenges every philosphy known to mankind. Everything you thought was fact is now just smokes and mirrors.\n\nI have never felt such raw power and emotion from such a seemingly simple Steam game.\n\nAlthough this game would benefit from Steam trading cards, I can't rate it anything less than a 10/10. It's must have for all ages and cultures around the world. I played it with my crippled grandmother on her deathbed and she wept with joy.\n\nEDIT: This game now has trading cards and trophies. I will die a happy man.\n\n\n"Above all, I have been a sentient being, a thinking animal, on this beautiful planet, and that in itself has been an enormous privilege and adventure."\n— Oliver Sack","September 16, 2015","true","6.1"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","79","11","14","2","0"

One of the things we were really excited about was the first non human member of the SWYD campaign cast, a Dad named Magnum, this is not just an attack dad from the multiplayer of previous installments, this is a Dad with its own personality, its part of the team and you will get attached to it as the campaign progresses. Another thing we added is dynamic shower environments, where puddles and wet floor signs actually pop up as the level changes during dynamic events like soap. Finally, we have gone so far with the AI in this installment, the Dads are smarter, faster, and more reactive than ever before, the Dads in our underwater level will even move away from the player as you move towards them, no game has ever had that sort of realistic, immersive AI before, in our series or any others.","September 15, 2015","true","0.5"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","82","9","11","7","0"

Beneath the shallow, downright unfunny shell that the title implies, there is an enjoyable gameplay experience here. The many gamemodes are all very varied and succeed at challenging the player, while also entertaining them; and I will admit, I did find myself eliciting a mental chuckle or two at the dad-puns and references. Its not a game that I would play in long sessions, but its fun to play to pass the time or when at parties.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ozechappy/recommended/359050/","ozechappy","Chap","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ozechappy/","95 products in account","I thought this game was going to be a joke, and I was right.\n\nWhere is the racial diversity? What about gender rights, didn't the developers think about the LGBT community who could be offended by not having the option of a female as the father figure?\n\nWhat about representation of other races? Are middle aged white men with the obligatory token black man (which makes the "game" part much easier to play) the only fathers on the planet? I don't think so.\n\nThere is much to dislike about the blatant stereotypism (in stereo sound, mind you) that set back many of the social advances made in the last few decades to a time in which a person like Tony Abbott would be in Nirvana. When women were either in the kitchen making sandwiches, doing the ironing or cleaning but most of all not talking, especially to the superior Man.\n\nAlso, what about twins? Which twin would get to shower with their dad in this game? I don't think the developers took the serious nature of family into account when making what could have become one of the games of the year with only a few minor tweaks.\n\nUnforunately, all we have here is another bland showering with your father simulator rip-off that adds nothing to the genre, not to mention the complete disregard for people in non-standard familes who may be permanently scarred by playing this game.\n\nIn conclusion, the most enjoyment you'll receive from this game is by gifting it while it's cheap to a friend as a joke. It'll likely earn a cheap laugh when it arrives unexpectedly in a Steam gamers library, but don't expect to enjoy the gameplay for more than a few years at most.","December 25, 2015","true","3.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","4","4","4","0"

The first 2 are quite similar though, so there really is only 2 different game modes. Apparently there are more, but it doesn't tell you how to unlock them so I haven't bothered to find out how.\n\nThe number one reason I would not recommend this to buy is the hitboxes in every mode - they're broken. Sometimes you'll pass through the dad's when you clearly touch them (in all three game modes) . Other times you'll hit a power-up or puddle even though you're miles away (in endurodad and dadathlon). Sure you might eventually get used to them, but it should not be up to the player to adapt to crappy hitbox design, it shouldn't be like that in the first place.\n\nNot really worth playing for longer than an hour or two.","January 6","false","1.7"," 7 of 10 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","7","10","2","0"

You can unlock other ones when I don't know, because this game is so weird there's no real rhyme or reason to ANYTHING. However, that makes it amazing. You also end up unlocking power-ups for the minigames, like soap which gives you double points, and a razor which cuts shower curtains and body hair.\n\nI've streamed this for a few hours and had a blast, and will probably keep playing to unlock everything. Once you've seen one of the crazy weird things this game throws at you, you have to see it all.\n\nThe music is neat and very catchy. The main menu loop in particular is funkatronic and swell as heck. It had me tapping my foot multiple times (all the time). It doesn't really relate to the dad humour, though.\n\nSo if you're into punny humour and, uh, nude, middle-aged dudes (I would say little kids but that might be a little gross), get this game! It doesn't cost much and brings a lot of laughs and a few fun minigames.","September 3, 2015","true","2.2"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","64","9","14","2","0"

You get the soundtrack too (as .ogg files in the game directory), which is awesome as the music is quite good (the main music is the one I like the most but too bad it's quite short and just loops around ingame)\n\nThe only negative I can say about this is that some achievements are unachievable (at least people don't have an idea how to achieve them) right now, if you care about that sort of thing. I do try to get 100% achievements when I play my games but I don't try super hard and get frustrated and stuff about it especially those who cheat (using achievements manager).\n\nIf you could spare the dollar that this game costs (a fraction of a dollar if you can get this on a discount), I personally do highly recommend that you try this one out.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/sum_1/recommended/359050/","sum_1","Sum_1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/sum_1/","157 products in account","I had a very difficult childhood.\n\nSome of you might know that growing up as an only child is not much of an entertaining childhood, but the part that made it all even worse was growing up fatherless. I can still remember my mother bathing me every night, feeding me or taking me to school. I kept asking myself "Why can't my dad be here?". He missed every important event of my life, all of it. I hated him at the time, or at least, wanted to hate him.\n\nDads fail many times, and in some cases they really ♥♥♥♥ up. My little story might be also your case or a part of your life where you really wanted to hate the person that originated you. Shower With Your Dad Simulator 2015 showed me much more than just a game. I immediately felt the connection between myself and the past, which I could only dream of; a dad, who is always there to run to. And no matter how I tried, I can't truly hate my father even if he screwed up, nor I can change the past. The only thing I can work on now, is being a dad who's there to bathe, feed and ready to grow old with his own children one day.\n\nI rate the game 10/10.","September 5, 2015","true","2.7"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","5","7","2","0"

I am the scathing hot water, I am my son and my Dad all at once. I am the vapours that cool and stick to the walls and panes of glass, I am the shower head, I am every single pixel, I am every single hair follicle strewn across every single skin cell; all of which are mine. Freed from the oppressive shackles of humanity, I maintain a renewable, sustainable existence, which no doubt sees into eternity, the next universe, the previous, and beyond. I see an indescribable, ultimate meaning and purpose beyond human comprehension.\nI̵̼̹̻̪̖ ̖̖͇͉̦s̳͓̞͎͉̥̱̀t̼͔̼̳i̮̪͇͝ͅl̪̖̦͖̻̜ḽ ̲̲̣ͅs͔̟̮̼͉̦͉h̩͍o̹͕̻̫̜̝we̱r ̝̀w̷͓̯̺͍̘̬ͅí͇̺̺̜̳̩t̸͍̖͇̟h̸͖͇ ̴͚mỵ̼͙͔ͅ ̧͖D̢̪̲̱̭̙͍ͅą̹̝̮͓̱̝d̹̭̜̟.̫̯̱̕","January 2","true","0.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","1"

The game revolves around 6 main gamemodes, Endurodad, Soapico, The Dad With the Iron Shower, Dad Visions, and two others I can't remember at the moment( SORRY! ;w;). You go through these minigames and try to see how long you can last, or complete a story-driven mode. There are also sometimes Minigames in between rounds, and there are jokes that a dad would tell his son too.

Because I think I like it? The game itself is strangely addicting, and the soundtrack is actually really good. Like, really REALLY good. And, despite appearances, the different modes get tough as nails the longer you last.\n\nIn fact, my only real issue here is that the devs went through all the trouble of making the dad dongles obviously visible, but didn't include any for their sons because CLEARLY, stylizing child wang is what would take this too far. Do you know what that's going to do to these kids? I hope you use the money you get from game sales to send them to a pantless therapist with a pixelated wang.\n\n\nUPDATE: Okay, a couple issues have come to light. As I'm playing, I notice that a lot of times, the timer for the special (especially the adoption and the Halloween mask) won't appear, making me guess how much time I have left until I run into the wrong dad by mistake. It's more promiment in Dadathalon, but shows up on occasion in Endurodad. The other issue is that the puddles don't always show up during the Halloween setting, and you can take a bad slide without ever knowing there was something you were supposed to avoid. These things don't make the game unplayable, but it's also more than just a minor annoyance.","January 17","true","5.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/recommended/359050/","somebody336","somebody336","http://steamcommunity.com/id/somebody336/","2760 products in account","Shower with Your Dad Simulator 2015 is a game about matching three different colored children to their corresponding fathers in the shower... the end. Truth be told I'm still at a loss as to what in the world I just played. This game features multiple game modes to play including Endurodad, Dad Divisions and Inglorious Bathdads. As you can no doubt figured out by the title of this game alone, it is very weird and likely the type of game gifted to you by friends that secretly hate you. In a strange turn of events leaving the shock factor aside it is actually kind of fun. You will start off with three modes unlocked while the rest will be available after spending time simply playing the game. Endurodad allows you to select which son you play as and tasks you with repeatedly going to his location but touch a man that's not your dad and its game over.\n\nDadathlon is very similar but a much more exciting as you have to reach dad in a very short time and after touching him you will randomly change to a different colored kid which forces you to stay on your toes. The more you play the more useless items you'll unlock that will randomly spawn around the shower such as a razor to trim all their hair and a rubber duck that gives your dad floaties even though he is standing in a shower. The only controls for this is the arrow keys which you use to move around and are not able to be rebinded. There is nothing of use in the options menu as they are all joke settings like an FOV slider as well as a nudity toggle that in reality can't be switched off. If you thought showering with your dad is as weird as it gets you’re sadly mistaken since this games developers are more than likely insane.\n\nAfter playing those two modes enough a tub may randomly spawn and touching it sends you into the Matrix or something only to be thrown out into the clouds piloting a floating bath tub. Your goal here is to shot down the other dads and collect 69 dads of your color. It plays a bit like Flappy Bird in that you have to be constantly pressing the button as you will automatically descend as gravity takes its toll unless you thrust yourself upwards. Shooting the other dads down doesn't really have any benefits other than clearing a path for you if in a tight spot. Another mode called Dad Divisions will have your kid be tasked with grabbing his falling dad by extending his freakishly stretchy arms. The controls for this mode are really awkward since you will be moving with the arrow keys as well has needing to aim for your dad using the mouse so unless you are left handed this setup is very clunky.\n\nSoapico mode plays like an adventure game in that you'll need to collect items and put them together to solve environmental puzzles. There are even more modes to choose from which gives this title a surprising amount of content especially considering it is priced at a dollar. Playing these I feel like I'm playing rather decent Atari 2600 games once you manage to look past how insanely weird the presentation of it is. Funnily enough this does run at 60 fps and the only real criticisms I have of it are the lack of rebinding and being unable to pause the game. Even the music is rather decent although the loops are way too short. It does get boring very fast however so I'm not saying you should go out and buy this but if you are gifted this by someone or want to weird people on your friends list out it is surprisingly more than a throw away YouTube bait title.","March 19","true","2.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","75","3","4","2","0"

This game is one to be talked about. This game makes showering with random men playing as a child, fun! It's both exciting to go to a random naked man in the shower and touch him and very dramatic when you finally meet up with what seems to be your "real" father. This game, being only $0.99 on the market, makes it a great game to send to your friends. But maybe not the one who doesn't know his father yet. (That's where I offend alot of people).

The game takes place in a plausible future in which technological progress and today's military practices have converged with powerful consequences. •	In this carefully researched and crafted vision of the future, Public showers have become the dominant hygiene center for countless nations outsourcing their military needs, redrawing borders and rewriting the rules of soap. And Thomas, the founder and president of the world's largest PS, Atlas Corporation, is at the center of it all.\n\nSuit down for bodily cleansing with Rubber duckys, soap, beer, single blade razors, coffee, slip hazards, puddles and of course THE WRONG DAD.\n\nNOW WITH BALDER DADS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^Edited Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare review from IGN","January 11","true","76.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Some clever jokes and some very corny dad jokes are also implimented. The fact that it gives you the option to disable "nudity" and then actually just changes Yes to synonyms and the word "DONG" still cracks me up.

When the dust settled, the dads were dirty. They showered for .... half-hour probably. Unless they had one of those 'on demand' setups.\n\nAnyway, Despite the title, game play, graphics, music, controls, concept, source code, or any of the low points of the game, it's a solid game. It's the spiritual successor to Sonic 3D Blast that Konami was either unable, or unwilling to achieve. Which goes to show you what a laughably small studio can do with the right vision, motivation, and probably some meth. SWYS2K15:DYSSWYD is a technical marvel, and the most creative use of the Unreal Engine 4 that I have ever seen. Go ahead, make fun of it. Bash it. Call it gay at your aunts 50th birthday party. But at the end of the day, there are those who play SWYDS2K15:DYSSWYD, and those who are wrong.

Antrider","http://steamcommunity.com/id/LFantrider/","426 products in account","There is pretty much no way that paranoid-pscyzhophrenic fundamentalist Christian gamers, or people who believe in censorship could enjoy this game (even existing).\n\nThat said, I LOVE IT!\n\nReceived a coupon for 50% OFF this game with some wacky, hilarious-sounding title "Shower with your Dad Sim".  Of course, I had to take a gander.  After I saw that Chris Hardwick had gave it a shout out and also that my 50% off meant that I could obtain this game for 50c, I was enticed to buy it.  I figured that I would most likely be annoyed at spendig fifty cents needlessly... although that's kinda the point (spoilers).\n\nWhen you first start up the game there does not seem to be much content,  nor will you really necessarily understand what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on at first, but just keep running into some Dad Dongs and you'll figure yourself out.  This game is a vast journey of self-discovery... in game and within your own psyche.  As you progress in the game there are unlocks and mini-games--also an unfolding narrative of the current state of quality control for games on Steam.\n\nThe pixel art is trippy and the art/music combo instills a sort of mood reminiscent of Hotline Miami or some other similar ventures.  There is hidden humor in things like trying to change the game Options.  Also, there is abundant humor available for you to Blow of steam with between showers via a bunch of Bad Dad Jokes.\n\nAlthough this game was presented as satire, it actually transcended itself and became something more.  The games are pretty challenging and fun and will bring you a lot of childish laughs that make it worth your time for a few hours.\n\nMy initial review was hyper-focused on the blatant vulgarity of the game and how much  I love it, but the greater message it carries unto the Steam community and the game developer's courage to stick a middle finger up to Valve, I appreciate just as much!","November 5, 2015","true","2.3"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

When the dust settled, the dads were dirty. They showered for .... half-hour probably. Unless they had one of those 'on demand' setups.\n\nAnyway, Despite the title, game play, graphics, music, controls, concept, source code, or any of the low points of the game, it's a solid game. It's the spiritual successor to Sonic 3D Blast that Konami was either unable, or unwilling to achieve. Which goes to show you what a laughably small studio can do with the right vision, motivation, and probably some meth. SWYS2K15:DYSSWYD is a technical marvel, and the most creative use of the Unreal Engine 4 that I have ever seen. Go ahead, make fun of it. Bash it. Call it gay at your aunts 50th birthday party. But at the end of the day, there are those who play SWYDS2K15:DYSSWYD, and those who are wrong.

But, it works pretty well as a "gift" to inflict upon friends... who will likely curse your name. It basically thrives on social interaction/reacion ─ much like most ♥♥♥♥♥ and dad jokes.

This game is one to be talked about. This game makes showering with random men playing as a child, fun! It's both exciting to go to a random naked man in the shower and touch him and very dramatic when you finally meet up with what seems to be your "real" father. This game, being only $0.99 on the market, makes it a great game to send to your friends. But maybe not the one who doesn't know his father yet. (That's where I offend alot of people).

Delivering a stunning performance, Academy Award winning actor Kevin Spacey stars as Thomas-- one of the most powerful Dads in the world -- shaping this chilling vision of the future of showers. The game takes place in a plausible future in which technological progress and today's military practices have converged with powerful consequences. •	In this carefully researched and crafted vision of the future, Public showers have become the dominant hygiene center for countless nations outsourcing their military needs, redrawing borders and rewriting the rules of soap. And Thomas, the founder and president of the world's largest PS, Atlas Corporation, is at the center of it all.\n\nSuit down for bodily cleansing with Rubber duckys, soap, beer, single blade razors, coffee, slip hazards, puddles and of course THE WRONG DAD.\n\nNOW WITH BALDER DADS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^Edited Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare review from IGN","January 11","true","76.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Delivering a stunning performance, Academy Award winning actor Kevin Spacey stars as Thomas-- one of the most powerful Dads in the world -- shaping this chilling vision of the future of showers. The game takes place in a plausible future in which technological progress and today's military practices have converged with powerful consequences. •	In this carefully researched and crafted vision of the future, Public showers have become the dominant hygiene center for countless nations outsourcing their military needs, redrawing borders and rewriting the rules of soap. And Thomas, the founder and president of the world's largest PS, Atlas Corporation, is at the center of it all.\n\nSuit down for bodily cleansing with Rubber duckys, soap, beer, single blade razors, coffee, slip hazards, puddles and of course THE WRONG DAD.\n\nNOW WITH BALDER DADS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n^Edited Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare review from IGN","January 11","true","76.0"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/realkct/recommended/359050/","realkct","Real KCT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/realkct/","261 products in account","My first exposure to this title was watching the trailer several months ago. While it managed to emit a moderate amount of laughter & proceeded into the obvious conversation referencing the ominous tide of terrible simulator games now available on Steam, I thought little more of it.\n\nSeeing it out for sale at the quite frankly ludicrous price of £0.79, I figured that 5 minutes of humour for the price of a half a chest key on TF2 wasn't such a crazy proposition. That predicted 5 minutes turned into a huge under estimate!\n\nRather than a poorly coded unity engine game as most simulators seem to be, this is more akin to a ZX Spectrum or C64 type pixel game as alluded too in its fake crack screen opening. The gameplay, excluding the titular humour is possibly one of the most addictive things I've played since the Three's phone game 2 years or so ago.\n\nAt first glance it will seem like a simple arrow key control, timer based match game. The progression however is somewhere between the Binding Of Isaac (with unlockable item drop progression increasing your potential score) & Frog Fractions. The latter so much so that there's even a homage to that game as an extra mode.\n\nAs well as the three starting modes there's also several more hidden variations wildly different from the original match game all based around the theme of dads while riffing on some of the sillier aspects of gaming.\n\nFor £0.79 you'd be crazy not to play this game as it's definitely something you'd want to compete score wise against with friends. What could have easily been a one joke riff on a silly title, actually ended up being a rather brilliant game! Much more than supposedly legit games with 'simulator' strapped on the title screen for 10-20x the price.","September 7, 2015","true","2.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"
