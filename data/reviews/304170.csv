Haven't seen any yet.\n\nCons:\n\n1.  Sluggish combat.  Kick-♥♥♥ and enemies seemingly move in slow motion.  The game lists combos you can refer to, but the movements are so slow that you'll more than likely get hit before you're done executing them.  Finishing moves involve drawn out animations that you'll wish you could skip just so you can move on.  There is absolutely no progression.  You're stuck with the same basic moves the whole game.  Combat basically consists of light/heavy attacks, counter, rinse, repeat.\n\n2.  The voice acting is ATROCIOUS.  It sounds like a bad Spanglish dub.  I didn't realize Kick-♥♥♥ grew up in a Mexican barrio.\n\n3.  There is a game-killing bug that doesn't allow you to continue where you left off despite the save icon flashing at the bottom right hand screen.  Instead, it boots you to the beginning of the level EVERY TIME.\n\nEdit:  After further playthrough, I realized that the game only saves at the beginning of each level.  Lame.  What modern game forces you to play a whole level without any save points?\n\n4.  No co-op, no option to play as Hit-Girl which is what everybody wants.\n\n5.  There is no exploration.  Levels consist of you moving from one cluster of enemies to another till the level is mercifully over.\n\n6.  There are no unlockables.  No bonus comics to collect, no alternate costumes, no art gallery, etc.  Absolutely nothing to entice you to play further.\n\nI'm about an hour in and I'm finding it hard to justify playing any longer. If it was a physical copy, it'd probably would have been flung out the window a long time ago.  The game as is, is not worth more than $10 as a new release.  Personally, I'd wait till it was down to $5 or lower.","August 16, 2014","false","5.7"," 1,837 of 1,907 people (96%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","96","837","1","9","46"

I imagine the conversation that occurred at Freedom Factory went like this: Producer: "Great job on the Spanish voice over, you brought out the vigilante in you. So, can you do the English, Italian and German too?" VO: "Uh, well, you know.. Product: "Excellent, I'll schedule you for a couple more hours. Jorgeeeee! We're good on localization! Cancel the American's contract."\n\n-Terrible script and sound bites. The writer tried their hardest to inject every possible unrelated pop-culture reference in every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ scene.\n\n-Uninspired level design that is on par with The Elder Scrolls: Daggerfall when it comes to visual quality and consistency. Everything is so sickeningly bland and heavily reused in the four areas the game kicks you through, that you will appreciate the few and badly illustrated comic scenes in between. I've fallen through the game's geometry 3 times at least, losing time and patience, while trying to tip-toe through the scenery.\n\n-Slow and clunky camera controls plus the occasional forced camera angle for street fighter-style segments. The camera doesn't move with your character when elevated either.\n-Terrible controls that cannot be changed on PC. That's right, you are stuck with whatever default Alt/E/Space controls they developers deemed "optimal" for your experience. They didn't even bother to provide you with a menu for that.\n\n-Fight combos are IMPOSSIBLE to pull with keyboard controls, you absolutely need a gamepad for that. I truly believe that the developers didn't test the game with that setup.\n\n-Music plays the same 3 oddly-misplaced tracks over and over, while the voice overs just punched more salt into my bleeding ears.\n\n-Movement and pace throughout the entire game is absolutely slow and pointless: you run like a turtle, your fights are agonizing and running through the world presents no excitement or purpose, aside from finding some random Wi-Fi spots and graffiti to cover.\n\nOn the upside, the graphic style and main character's design were OK and fitting for the comic book style, it's a pity they did not fill the world with anything exciting or worthy of the comic book.\n\nThe entire game feels so badly and quickly manufactured that you'll feel like burning every dollar you spent on this crap. A fitting metaphor presented itself every time Kick-♥♥♥ used the stairs saying "Why the hell am I doing this, heh!" Indeed, Kick-♥♥♥, why the ♥♥♥♥ am I?\n\n.5/5 (Lowest mark so far!)","November 29, 2014","false","6.8"," 79 of 84 people (94%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","94","79","84","12","2"

The combat is like a knock off of the Rocksteady Batman games...  only much slower and much worse.  While Batman's combat flowed this combat sees massive slowdowns, and isn't difficult at all.  Even if the combat was perfect it becomes super repetitive with about 3 finishing moves.  After the 500th time kicking someone in the groin, choking them or breaking their arm it gets really old.\n\nDid I mention the combat is super slow, super slow...  I'm not sure if it's some massive delay in the button inputs or if the delay is intentional to make the game easier.\n\nI got this game for 5 dollars.... and I feel as though I paid 4.95 too much for it.  I can understand the game is a licensed title but jeez did they tie up all the money in securing the license and ignore the actual gameplay?  The only positives this game has going for it are the trading cards are selling for a decent amount, but still not enough to pick the game up...\n\nsave your money, save your time, and buy something that is actually worth the price.","December 12, 2014","false","1.8"," 35 of 37 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","35","37","0","0"

There seems to be less than half a dozen finisher moves and each one takes a good 15 seconds or so to execute, so you might as well strike the enemy a couple of extra times instead to save yourself some time. Combat is as follows: X, Y, X, Y, X, Y. Oncoming attack? Hit B to dodge. X, Y, X, Y, X, Y. If you want to vary things up, you can try different permutations of X and Y, but it doesn't do much. There are combos you can do by hitting three attacks one after another, which momentarily stuns the enemy, but there's very little difference between them and dodging an attack breaks your combo anyway.\n\nThere's no variety in the combat at all. You're constantly fighting the same two kind of enemies, normal and big enemies. They do occasionally have weapons or a shield. You'll be fighting a big thug with a shield in one level, then in the next level a big police officer with a shield. Your moves remain the same throughout the whole game. How about letting me use that baseball bat I disarmed from an enemy? Isn't that beat'em up 101?\n\nAround the second level I got tired of beating up countless groups of enemies, so I tried just walking past them... it worked. In fact, you can walk past about 80% of the enemies in this game. Occasionally there will be a gate you can't climb over until you clear out a group of nearby enemies, but any other type of object (electric box, ladder) you can interact with while in combat.\n\nFor some reason Kick-♥♥♥ has a Spanish accent. The voice acting is atrocious. Besides having little to no emotion, almost all of the voice actors mispronounce words (parkour = parker, goth = ghoth). Every other time you climb a ladder, for some reason Kick-♥♥♥ spouts "Damn. Why the hell am I doing this?". You'll be hearing the same taunts over and over throughout the game.\n\nBesides the issues with clipping, invisible walls galore, the camera obstructing your view in combat, and the lack of mouth movement when characters speak, I actually like the graphic style of the game. If they had put a bit of effort into making the combat fun and varied, maybe put some things to do in the levels besides beating up on groups of thugs every 30 seconds, they might have had a decent game.\n\nThe game also screws up your system font every time you launch it. Many thanks to the German reviewer here for finding out what the game does: http://steamcommunity.com/id/unevermind/recommended/304170/\n\nThe game disables ClearType in Windows. To re-enable it, go to the Control Panel and search for "Adjust ClearType text". Check "Turn on ClearType" and hit next a few times to make your fonts normal again.","February 7, 2015","false","2.8"," 26 of 28 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","26","28","4","0"

Type fighting style.\nThe audio is terribly inbalanced. Ranging from eardrum piercingly loud music to barely audible voices. Made worse when they had people voice over this music.\nControls are, at best. ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. even menu controls made me wonder why they didn't just copy every other game with sensible controls.\nCrediot to the devs, the finishers are... inventive? If exteremely ridiculous and impractical.\nI only managed to get to the 2nd group of thugs before i turned this off. It's an awfully designed game which i couldn't bare continuing through.\n\nI bought a cheap bundle in order to get this game, i even regret spending that $3 on it.\nCertainly wouldn't recommend unless you want to laugh at how terrible it is.\nWhoever at "testmania.de" gave it 80% rating clearly didn't actually launch the game at all.","February 7, 2015","false","1.4"," 26 of 29 people (90%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","90","26","29","4","3"

Gameplay:like  poor man  Batman style hit/counter, but thing is it slow as melasa. You can drink coffee waiting for your hit to land after counter, or landing two hits in succesion takes few seconds, like main guy is suffering from tetanus . Most enemies in the "game" you dont even have to fight, you can literally run by them, they have 2-3 m radius of movement, and they sure as hell wount follow you. Fighting is painfully boring, if you would fight every group of enemies you would most like commit suicide in real life sooner or later ( They could use this game on terrorists now that i think about it, forget electrocution, waterboarding...hell just give them this game.\nYou want invisible walls, check....this is literally like walking in a hallway...all space that you see around, well forget about exploration, if you will not meet invisible wall you will fall thru the floor in to abyss. The worst thing, you dont die, you just get stuck there and of course restart is needed, and then you have to do all level AGAIN, from start smh.\nStory is arghhh cringe inducing to say the least. People who wrote lines for this...man my dog would do it better, with his muddy paws on some paper. And its not that bad that it would be good because it would be funny, no this is painful to listen. Animations are insanely over the top, like guy literally massacres poor enemies in such a fashion ISIS would be shocked. But most of the time "game" suffers from some kind of spasms so you and enemy, while you are breaking his neck get teleported to other part of map.\nOptions in the game? What options, you get story, controls and thats it. Sound is only decent thing, and only because you can ignore it. All in all, its baaaaaad.\n","July 2, 2015","false","4.8"," 22 of 28 people (79%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","79","22","28","7","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/recommended/304170/","pepsimanvsjoe","pepsimanvsjoe","http://steamcommunity.com/id/pepsimanvsjoe/","1281 products in account","So I just finished playing through Suck-♥♥♥ 2 (lol I'm so clever).\nWhere do I even begin with this mess?\n\nI suppose I should start with the positive qualities. The translation is an absolute riot. The jokes have no sense of timing or humor, and the pop-culture references cost me 10 years of my precious life. Since the movie bombed harder than a bob-omb, none of the actors bothered to do voice-work for the low-budget pile of trash game nearly a year later. Instead the developer grabbed random men and women off of the street and shoved a microphone in their face. The results are about what you'd expect.\n\nThe other positive to Kick-♥♥♥ 2 is that almost all of the fights, are completely optional! Stupid me, I actually fought quite a few of the bad-guys, thinking that there were locked doors or invisible walls that prevented me from leaving. As it turns out, I can run past everyone and complete each stage, focusing only on the tremendous voice-work and my alcoholism. It's not like there's an experience-system, unlockable moves, or even a freaking score to provide any incentive to fight. I guess the developers figured that nobody would find any fun in playing this game, so they provided a hidden technique for skipping fights. It's a shame I didn't discover it earlier.\n\nThe negatives....Wow. The things that are wrong with this game could fill the Library of Congress. First off, the only playable character is Kick-♥♥♥ himself, possibly the least likable hero in history. Hit-Girl should have been a given, but I would've settled for anyone that isn't Kick-♥♥♥, like uh...Doctor Gravity. Playing as Donald Faison(Scrubs! Clueless!) dressed as a Superhero? This game could be even worse and I'd recommend it. Hell if they brought Nic Cage's character back and made him playable, I'd consider Kick-♥♥♥ 2 the best game of 2014. Instead, we're stuck with the one guy nobody likes.\n\nThe combat rips off the Arkham series. There are a handful of basic combos, finishing moves, and counters. Also KA can shock everything around him, or even himself. Apparently these abilities damage on-screen enemies or cause KA to do more damage. I honestly can't tell the difference. They say imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so Kick-♥♥♥ 2 is Betty White wearing the same dress that Jennifer Lopez wore at the 42nd Grammy Awards. Actually I take that back, I don't want to offend Betty by comparing her to this miserable game.\n\nIn-between each chapter are some terribly drawn still images. I have two questions: Who did they hire? & Doesn't Spain have child labor laws to prevent this from happening? It's just...really shocking. I've played Xbox Live Indie Games with better artwork. At least it's a break from playing the game, maybe I should consider this a positive...hmm..\n\nThe boss-fights are mostly just regular guys with different moves. Sometimes they forget what they're doing and just walk around so Kick-♥♥♥ can hit them. However, they can also be really cheap. Almost all of my deaths were due to boss-fights, and their hammer-toting friends that kill in 3 hits. The only other notable aspect of these fights is that they can't be skipped. Not only can you run past most of the fights in this game, but even if you die and restart the checkpoint, everyone that you killed stays dead. I'm not sure how that works but uh...hmm. Y'know this could be considered a positive as well. It means less time spent playing the game.\n\nAfter reaching a combo of 5 or more hits, Kick-♥♥♥ gets the ability to knock a weapon out of an enemy's hands. Once that thug drops his bat, sword, or gun, you never have to worry about it again. No really, it's impossible for any of the other nearby criminals to pick up that weapon and use it. Also, since the hero doesn't seem averse to snapping necks and generally killing everyone he meets, it seems strange that he doesn't have the ability to pick up any guns or swords. It would make the fights go by faster and...oh right. I forgot we're just supposed to run past everything. That's how the game is meant to be played.\n\nAside from running down hall-ways and listening to ridiculous, badly-translated conversations, there isn't anything else to this game. Actually I take that back, there are subway cars you have to dodge, and sometimes you even cross the street. If you play Kick-♥♥♥ 2 for three hours straight you are guaranteed to get a headache. This is most likely anecdotal evidence, and could apply to every other game made, but dammit! I'm hurting here.\n\nYou probably just got this game via an indie bundle. Hopefully you haven't played it yet. Me? I bought that bundle solely for this game and Dear Lord I am paying for it. I am paying for it so goshdang hard.\n\nBTW: Thanks Steam censors for thinking of the children. I'd hate to imagine all of the ruined childhoods due to seeing the word ♥♥♥.","January 27, 2015","false","3.7"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","93","13","14","2","0"

Voice acting is done by randoms.  The fight is complete garbage.  You fight like an amateur where you can input one action (punch or kick) every 2 seconds.  Because of that, you can't combo or chain attacks making each fight lasting 10 minutes long because you are 1v4 or 1v5 everytime. You basically do 1 punch then do a stand off for two seconds and then punch again.  The good part is, you can run from every fight except the boss fight.  Basically, you approach the mob, the fighting music starts, you run past them to continue your mission and the music stops telling you the mob isn't aggro anymore.  Even then, don't bother with this game, it is the biggest joke I have ever seen that gets made into a game.  There is no upside to playing this.

Graphics are horrible, many textures pop ins.The AI is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ whats even easier you can skip all the fights by just running past the guys and going on with the level and just fight the ones youre actually required to fight. The voice acting is some of the worst i have ever heared. Unlike the first game where they used actual lines from the movie and then used mediocre voice impersonators this game just uses random voice actors who sound nothing like the main actors from the movies. Dave sounds like a mexican and the girl that voiced Mindy sounds like she just read of the script and the first take was the one they used. Overall theres not one good thing in this game.

All of the time I spent on this game was trying to complete chapter 1.\nThe game is easy once you get the timing right, but the characters freeze on screen ending your game very often. This is one to listen to the negative reviewers on, as it is not a preference in gameplay or aesthetics... it is crashes and bugs that bring this one down. Your character will fall through the ground, or start floating into space. I play on a fully upgraded Mac, so it is not a hardware or driver issue.\nI am a fan of the film...but this game is too bugged. Shame because I like the look.\n\nDO NOT PAY $20 FOR THIS GAME!\n\nI got it in a bundle some time ago and am still dissapointed.","September 5, 2015","false","2.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I figure just because i don't like something does not mean that someone else won't enjoy it. However, This game is just bad. As a fan of the Kick-♥♥♥ movies i figured i'd give it a try. My advice is don't waste your money. The Voice acting is terrrible, the gameplay is really bad and its an all around horrible game. I tried to get into it many times before i decided to uninstall it. If you only saw screenshots you would think the game has potential, but Screenshots are about all this game has going for it.","December 5, 2015","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphhics are not so bad per se, but in my pc they consume a lot of resources more or less like inJustice on ultra settings.\n\nNsd when you try to overlook that problems and try to play de game crashes in several places leaving you unable to play it.\n\nI would ask for a refund if had buyed the game unfortunately it came in a bundle.","February 20","false","4.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
