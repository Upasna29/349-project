Unfortunately, this game isn't one of those unless you love similes. Most of the game is spent trying to figure out how to use which similes in the descriptions of the locations and action. "A cigarette burns in an ashtray like an ember in the campfire. Take the ember, give it to the mysterious man to melt his demeanor." I know noir loves similes and metaphors but while it's a novel concept to make them a part of the gameplay, it just isn't well-executed enough to have a game full of them.\n\nNow there is a walkthrough that takes you through the game that's accessible from the main menu but I feel that is the developers admitting that the gameplay is confusing at best.\n\nIn short, this game feels like something schoolkids in the 90's would play in the computer lab to help them understand similes but would turn them off to both PC games and word play.","June 3","false","0.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","7","7","0","0"

The tutorial was straightforward in explaining the system of the game as it covered text interactions, the use of similes, and navigation. The similes are easy to find as the sentences contain the word "like" for the most part. Using them is a different story. Progressing through the game can be described as requiring to think out of box or to make use of obscure item interactions. This aspect of the game is what players would most likely find frustrating. There are two options implemented that can help guide you through the game. One is your trusty servant which you meet at the start of the game (a hint system) and the second is a walkthrough which can be accessed in the main menu. The game is fairly linear though you can make use of different solutions in some instances.\n\nThe art fits the noir feel of the game and illustrates the locations the protagonists visits. I wish that the images would automatically change when I moved between locations, but the page only shows the drawings of newly visited locations. The image can be manually changed with the "picture" text command though. There is no audio as far as I can tell other than the music video on the page beyond the drawings. Text options such as font and size can be adjusted under settings in the main menu. There is an option to switch between full screen and windowed mode as well. If you are playing in windowed, starting a new game may force it back to full screen (you can switch back in the menu). Loading a save or restoring a save (after a game over) takes a while since all record of your gameplay such as dialogue and text commands are loaded (you can view all previous events and actions by clicking on the bottom corner of the page to flip through pages).\n\nThe game is bit short so I wouldn't exactly recommend it at full price, but feel free to pick it up on sale if you're interested in an interactive story kind of game. Achievements were easy since most followed the progression of the story  while others indicated what needed to be done. It was my first venture into this type of game and overall, I enjoyed what I played.","June 5","true","4.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"
