After the 24 hour PvP immunity was up and I was playing the PvE part of the game, I saw that you're forced into PvP no matter what so that you cannot even play the PvE part of the game. As soon as someone decides to attack you you're thrown into the game and if they have spent more than you, you will lose, you will not have a chance. So then you lose charges. Ok well that would be fine except when you go back to the PvE part of the game to get more charges, someone attacks you again and you're forced into PvP to the point you eventually lose all your charges and then you're forced to spend real money to recharge them. It's a vicious cycle. You cannot get more charges because people are constantly attacking you. This is a shame because it's a decent game otherwise. This ONE point will cause the game to fail. For this reason alone the game is heavily P2W and is why I must give it a negative review.","March 26","false","8.6"," 25 of 33 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","25","33","0","3"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/smortimer/recommended/432290/","smortimer","SilasMortimer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/smortimer/","321 products in account","I really wanted to like this. I was a huge fan of Heroes of Might and Magic III, spending untold hours play and replaying it. So when I saw this and heard that it was "basically a HOMM MMO" (almost a palindrome!), I thought, I'm in! I was curious to see what they would have to give up from the HOMM concept to make it online, immediately thinking of things that would be tricky to get working. Oh well, I thought, I'll see how it turned out. It didn't really dampen my enthusiasm.\n\nWhen I started playing, it brought me back, even though it felt a bit like a cheesy, dollar-store ripoff of the real thing. It still had most of the basics down and was still a lot of fun. The units didn't stack, but since there was PvP, I figured that would make some sense. In fact, the first time I was attacked by another player, I was really grateful for the attempt at balance, particularly since they had attacked while I was AFK on a phone call. (Tip: If you're playing this and need to go AFK, log out first.) I don't know how long I was gone, but my opponent's melee units were halfway across the field and his ranged had already done some damage to one of my ranged, but I feel pretty good about the fact that I won anyway. The next two people who attacked me were a bit higher level and I lost those, but I did well enough that I had hopes to get better. Anyway, as in HOMM, if you have units all of the same 'type', they get bonuses. I don't remember what that is, but I never saw anything like being able to attack twice due to morale, so I don't think it was that. Probably for the best. Interestingly, you interact with your units outside of battle as cards, each one having a charge, which is a number on the card representing the unit's 'lives', which are added to every time you get another card of the same unit.\n\nOutside of battle is a bit strange. As others have mentioned, you don't have a town in this game and as far as I could tell there weren't any you could conquer. This makes the concept of controlling resources seem a little pointless, and for the most part, they're only used for upgrading your spells and raising the level of your units. One obviously necessary departure from  the HOMM gameplay is movement. Whereas HOMM had your hero only able to move a certain amount in a 'day' that you had to carefully manage, this game gives you a whole lot of action points and every thing you do only takes one to three of them. This feels jarring if you're an HOMM fan, particularly when you can spend one action point to go all the way across the map to the mana well and refill your mana... after every battle.\n\nThat brings me to where I started to realize that the gameplay in this was far, far shallower than HOMM and that took a whole lot of the fun out of it. The multiplayer experience of that kind of game is best when you have people physically present, either in person or through a network, each player waiting their turn at which point the other players wait for theirs, unless there's a battle, in which both players take their turns. It's difficult to point out one big thing that ruins the feeling and the fun. It was a lot of little things. Things like your ranged units being able to move and still shoot after moving. You can't enjoy the feeling of being so much more powerful than a wandering unit that it asks to join you. Your ability to pretty much do as much as you like without worrying about time management and distance traveled and whether you're travelling on a road or through various terrains. Only having five units at most make the battles less interesting. No towns means no sieges. Being able to replenish your mana at any time, over and over again, taking out a good amount of the challenge. And many, many other little things like these.\n\nI'm not blaming the developers so much. I think they've done pretty much the best you can do in making this kind of game an MMO. And with the work they've and some tweaking, I'd love to see a single player/multiplayer hotseat/network real-time turn-taking version of this. Considering how much the original has fallen, it could be nice to have a good one. The trouble is that this kind of game just doesn't seem to work well as an MMO. There are things I guess you just have to do in order to make it work that thins out the gameplay and makes it very repetitive.\n\nFor what it's worth, this is definitely not pay-to-win, but had it turned out better, I'd have been happy occasionally spending a little, just to support the game. As it is, the developers have made something really solid in a lot of ways and the community is great, so I might purchase something regardless just to give a little support despite not being able to recommend this, which I hate.\n\nMaybe there are ways to improve it. I'll probably come back from time to time to see if they find those ways. And again, if they made something single player with the issues I've mentioned (and others) resolved, it would be an easy buy for me.\n\n","April 8","false","11.2"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","2"

On the other hand if you want something with complex quests, story and game world then this game is not for you.\n\nPros:\n- it loads & runs quickly even on mediocre hardware\n- simple to learn, no complex game world, limited number of unit types\n- the battles are fun (if you like Heroes3-style battles)\n- I don't feel it to be pay-to-win (with money you can progress faster but no money-only feature, and the game is enjoyable without paying)\n\nCons:\n- 2D retro graphics (not everybody likes it)\n- lack of in-game help and documentation, and the UI needs improvements in general\n- not much configuration options on the settings pane\n\nTo sum up, this game is for you if you like battles in  turn-based strategy games, but you don't want things like city building, overcomplicated game rules or complex game world. This is something you can play for hours, but also when you have only 5 minutes for gaming.","March 15","true","105.8"," 12 of 19 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","12","19","0","0"

Of course, it is a freemium with all usual attributes and with significant amount of players with quite toxic attitude... although, this is quite a good game. Tactics here is less important comparing to Heroes of Might and Magic 3, as priority is shifted for gathering and upgrading strong army and spells. However if correct set of spells and smart tactic is used, it is possible to win a fight vs stronger opponent, and that makes it good and fun.\n\nI play it in rather casual style for few months, my achievements are quite modest: at the moment I can beat it to be in top 10 for boss raid, my character is somewhere in 4th hundred for pvp in arena. This game requires a lot of grind and at the same time it punishes players for overgrinding, as main goal is to get stronger units not more resources. Also I'd like to say that, in fact, 'pay to win' approach is fruitless here. Of course, you will have some advantage, but in order to use it you will have to play, even more than those who didn't pay. Almost none from top 50 in pvp payed a single cent, they are getting 'diamonds' (game currency) as a prize for participating in boss raid.\n\nSo I would recommend to try this game, just remember it is all about pvp and surviving in this pvp.","May 9","true","8.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
