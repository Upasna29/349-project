Not amazing, bot doesn't get tiring.\n+ Options! If the music does get tiring, then I can mute it and play the soundtrack from Braid to help me feel puzzle-y! This helps. Sometimes. :P\n+ One of the best games I've seen w/ only one dev. Very impressive! Also, the dev seems very devoted and responds to users.\n+ Mini "LogiLock" puzzles that sort of feel like a 2D rubix cube\n+ Bare bones of a level editor. (later updates will make it more user-friendly)\n+ HATS! UNLOCKABLE HATSHATSHATS!\nCONS\n- The graphics are rather lackluster.\n- Sometimes a puzzle takes longer than it should - I figure out the solution, but I have to retry many times to position things *just* right. However, this scenario is pretty uncommon.\n- The story isn't that captivating, so you should probably be into playing the puzzles themselves.\n\nTL;DR / SUMMARY\nHard, physics based puzzle-platformer provides good puzzles. There are no fillers, and gameplay is solid. Don't play this game if you just care about story or graphics, as the meat is in the puzzles :). Sometimes it takes trial-and-error is needed in positioning when the solution is apparent, making the puzzle take longer than it should.\n\n8.5/10\n\nAlso, It's better to have previous experience with puzzle games. I recommend getting Teslagrad, LIMBO, or Braid (a few of my personal favorites) before playing this. If you liked any of those, then get this.","August 25, 2015","true","7.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","0"

Every object can and should be used, but the physics of the game allows you to extend or invent the purpose of every stone, block or moving piece. Simply amazing. You don't call yourself a true logical platformer without spending hours with this game (and cursing more or less freqently). Forget the blocky graphics from demo - it's not important at all once you get into the game. This one is a gem! Strongly recommended! (But beware, some levels are very difficult so before you start, make yourself a large coffee ;)","August 24, 2015","true","4.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

The graphics are average and it takes some time to get used to the physics, but once you do, the game really shines. Most of the puzzles are very well thought of and it reminds me of Braid in that regard.\n\nThe game requires out-of-the-box thinking and sometimes trial-and-error approach. Sometimes it takes multiple plays to execute the puzzle even if you know the solution. But, it is not really a problem because there are plenty of checkpoints, so you'd lose a couple of seconds the most.\n\nBeside physics puzzles, there are also logic puzzles where you have to lure enemies away or make them press a switch or push a block for you.\n\nAnd there are a couple of pure logic puzzles which add to depth and variety. I especially like the rotating numeric wheel puzzle at the power generator in chapter five. That was a hard nut to crack.\n\nRecommended 9/10.","August 28, 2015","true","12.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Seeders is a difficult puzzle platformer that could easily frustrate some people. If you don't like frustrating puzzle platformers this game is probably not for you.\n\nIf you like hard to very hard puzzle platformers though you will probably love the game. The game has some very unorthodox solutions to the puzzles in the game. You will need to think out of the box in order to solve a lot of them.\n\nThe other thing that makes the game pretty hard is that it requires a lot of trial and error. Even if you figure out how to solve the puzzle sometimes you need to do the puzzle multiple times since there is little room for error before you have to reset the puzzle. This can get frustrating.\n\nAs far as length is concerned, the game is longer than what my playtime indicates since I ended up giving up on the game because it got so frustrating that it wasn't worth continuing to play.\n\nOther than the extreme difficulty, Seeders is a solid game. If you don't like frustratingly hard puzzle platformers, I would recommend not purchasing the game. If you really want a challenge and don't get frustrated quickly, I think you could enjoy Seeders.\n\nNote: I received a review copy of Seeder for free from the developer. Other than receiving the review copy for free I received no other compensation for this review.\n\nRead My Full Review [www.geekyhobbies.com]","August 26, 2015","true","5.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
