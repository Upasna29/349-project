I have played many grand strategy games and after a while alot of them seem to slow down to a grind with a rather clear path to victory. This game is slightly different. You may very well be able to win by just holding europe as a whole and posting an army to keep the contenental resistance down. But... you could really use those extra point from completely subjugating spain and Austria's not gonna rule itself (at least not while your tearing it down anyway) and russia sure doesn't seem to long of a walk in the summer, and by the way did we mention your allies the ottomans just ran out of their army fighting russian so the only thing standing between you and india is some *slight* royal navy presence and a few remaining ottomans. Conquering the world (or what matters of it) seems to be a piece of cake. Till everyone else learns how to fight. Then quite a few countries are going to come knocking with new training and equipment and very rudly ask for their stuff back, from you, in person, at paris (and only at paris). So you have to stop the conquest of random Italians and Ottomans to re-finish off the austrians and russians meanwhile the British keep you locked away from your troops in egypt and the spanish seem a bit peeved at your suggestions of "synergy". So you wind up trying to keep and empire the size of europe+1 together with shoestrings shot and strategy (and a ton of cursing the british). So in short I love this game. Buy it if you like grand strategy but don't want to know the name of every french sergant involved in the french reconquista.","March 17","true","7.0"," 52 of 61 people (85%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","85","52","61","11","0"

Well, here's the DEAL...\nV&G:N is a FUN GAME.\n\nIt is NOT heavy on the history, although there is a LOT of incidental history, the factions, nations involved etc.\n\nIt is NOT a simulation of Napoleonic warfare, but that means it's not inaccessable to the casual gamer either.\n\nWhat it is, is a very FUN computer version of the flavor of the Napoleonic era with board game aspects. It is VERY PLAYABLE.\n\nIt is pretty challenging and the combat system has just enough "rock, paper, sissors" to let you shine as a tactical genius (at times).\n\nIt has a great Event Cards feature that really makes it feel like a board game.\n\nIt is colorful, has a GREAT SOUND TRACK (somebody complained about the music track and I am here to tell you the music selections (classical) are PERFECT for the period being dramatized).\n\nOverall it is a GOOD VALUE for the price and there is a TON of replayability built in. A lot of ways to approach winning.\n\nI highly recommend it","March 18","true","6.7"," 34 of 36 people (94%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","94","34","36","2","1"

This isn't bad. Best explanation of the premise? It's essentially Risk with some additional depth added on plus it even has a battle system. The battle system itself in the simplest explanation is like paper (infantry), rock (cavalry), and scissors (artillery). Now give paper, rock and scissors passive bonuses like experience/promotions and general support buffs and you've about got the idea. There is also a naval component in the game but I tried to avoid that like the plague since I was playing as France. You've even got event cards which are played on the campaign map to give you some sort of bonus. Such as extra troops, upgraded unit types, creating new nations, etc etc. All in all, it's a simple game but sometimes the AI can be pretty brutal and punish you if you make mistakes.\n\nIn summation, great game for wargame fans or RISK fans who are looking for a bit more depth to your global conquest. Definitely recommended.\n\nGameplay Footage:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PtuKk_T6YI","March 20","true","5.2"," 34 of 39 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","34","39","7","0"

The tutorials provided explain everything really clearly and will have you playing quickly. However if you skip them your armies will be defeated and you may not know why (make sure you look at the tutorials).\n\nIt captures the feel of the period really well. For example you will want to battle (and defeat) Austria repeatedly. And you will see why Napolean can crush whoever he faces (although he can't be everywhere at once). Towards the end of the real war the coalition armies would avoid fighting armies commanded by Nappy. They would attack on other fronts. When Nappy departed for another front they would attack the army he had just left.\n\nAll your decisions are enganging. Do I attack Prussia or Spain ? Do I risk attacking Russia ? Do I keep my artillery at the front (more powerful but also more vunerable) or at the back ?\n\nThe system is really fun and would work well in other settings, such as the American Civil War.

The rules in both aspects are very simple and I was able to master them within the first 15 minutes.\nThe game itself is not overly difficult and could go quite fast, except for a general pacing issue that tends to slow it down. This is mainly because of the inclusion of, as far as I can tell, an irrelevant naval combat model. If you are sane and know how to spell Traffalg... Trafla... If you are sane, you won't move your ships around; but the English computer opponent sure does love moving its boats around and making sure you watch it doing it as the interface pans with every single move!\nI really enjoyed my time with Victory and Glory. I found the tactical battles, despite their simplicity and repetition, to be the best part of the game, when I was arranging my forces around and deciding which part of the battlefield and troops to focus on. While the strategic layer was adequate, it was not overly engaging (the whole game felt like the opposite of Hannibal, actually). Not being a grognard, I wasn't bothered by the ahistorical approach to capturing the flavour of the period, but I don't see me playing much of it anymore.\n\nSide note: Be advised a patch is in the works, which introduces some random mechanics around what were very clear and simple rules. The goal is to provide a bigger challenge. I guess the developers are experimenting and I really hope they figure a way to appeal to those seeking a better challenge, without losing what it is, to me, that gave the game its charm.","May 14","true","7.4"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

The basic expedition begins soon after the coronation of Napoleon as emperor and chronicles his following expedition against the European coalition of England, Austria and Russia with other forces in the continent observing the struggle with a neutral attitude. The secondary expeditions will lead you from the triumph of Marengo up to the Battle of Leipzig, also named Battle of Nations.\n\nThe action unfolds in two levels, in the general map where you will receive the most important strategic decisions and in the field of battle. The map reminded me the unforgetable tabletop strategy Risk and includes all the countries and the troops in the simple form of icons. The units can be split up at will and incorporate themselves with other units as well as move independently in different territories in order to confront crises.\n\nVictory and Glory: Napoleon distinguishes itself from the other titles in his category, not because of the amazing graphics or his musical score but for his strategic innovations. Every single minute that you will spend in his company you will feel inside the same sentiments that Napoleon felt in the course of his career: the loneliness of a person who is hated from an entire continent, the stress that rises from repeated crises in your state, you will experience the pride and the arrogance of a conqueror but also the sadness that burdens the breast of the loser after a difficult battle. The highest enjoyment you will feel playing it  is no other than the absolute autonomy of strategic movements in his digital world.\n\nThe tools of governing in Victory and Glory: Napoleon is the diplomacy,  event  cards, the deployment of great armies and the armed conflicts. Fluctuating the diplomacy rating with the use of political  points that is gathered by your choices is possible to guide the neutral powers at your side. Thus you can turn your newfound allies against the hateful British or improve your relations with the members of the hostile European coalition, isolating your arch nemesis from his allies. The event cards provide many  bonuses that should be selected at the appropriate time so that they have also the biggest possible impact in the strategic outcome. If, for example, an army of ten units approaches yours with hostile intent and your army have only five units dont worry. Check the event cards and use (if you have them) those that exchange your units with corresponding superior ones, annex the nation where they standing (if it doesn't belong in your state) and voila, you have neutralized the numerical superiority of the enemies.\n\nIn the field of battle, Drover made an amazing work drawing the unit's icons with the quality of a microscopic work of art. With the numerical depiction of experience on units it becomes easy to line them up in strong formations. The strategy in the battle is much deeper than that I have expected before playing the game. The alignment of the military in quartets where the side units enhance the interior ones is a fresh perspective in our digital wars. Placing experienced units in the flanks and weak units on the interior, form an armored legion that withstands everything. The battle mode has nothing to envy from the strategic greatness of a game of chess. How and whether the units will move, where to hit, along with the selection of the target, separates the winner from the loser. The automated processing of battle usually has better results than the manual one but does not offer the same pleasure. You will jumping from joy when you destroy a powerful hostile army cleverly placing your units and killing the enemy units by hitting them in the proper order. The randomness of the attack's outcome favors the continuous loading of your saved positions.\n\nThe artificial intelligence of Victory and Glory: Napoleon is so good that it will surprise you. Enemy nations are simply cunning: like a flock of hungry wolves they move carefully in the outskirts of my Empire and gather their forces by choosing the right time to strike. If they have superiority in a field, they attacking mercilessly. For example, in naval battles, i spent many nightmarish moments because the powerful British navy attacked and sank with ease a small number of my fleets. With my navy ravaged, the British temporarily made impossible any possible landing of French troops on their island and also they gain the ability to disembark their troops by sea to every part of the continent they want, remaining a constant threat to my territories.\n\nGiannis Moschonas\n\nEditor in www.gameworld.gr","March 25","true","2.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

Well, it is here! Sort of.\n\nSo far, I have played through one campaign and I love it. It has some differences from the boardgame (e.g., I dont think calvary can abandon a charge once an infantry forms a square) but it is a great experience. The battle system, a kind of basic miniatures minigame, may seem odd to those unfamiliar with the boardgame. The whole thing may be off-putting if you aren't expecting a virtual boardgame. But if you are the type that fondly thinks of counters and chits and miniatures-this is a solid purchase. My only issue is they have so far chosen to go with a single player  version where the player must be France. This is the proper first choice but I long for multi-player and a British campaign.

I wrote my review on OPNoobs.com, but here's a bit of it here:\n\n"Victory and Glory: Napoleon appears to be the PC version of the board game “Napoleon in Europe” which is excellent because NiE was truly amazing. I’ll be the first to admit that I’m not much of a board game player myself (Ticket To Ride stressed me out to the point of no return), but Napoleon in Europe, Risk, and Stratego were heavily played in my household growing up. The resemblances between the two are uncanny – they have to be one and the same.\n\nThe combat system is by far the greatest highlight of the title – units are spread out across a battlefield on “your side”, “their side” and (sometimes) a middle ground. Either side can take the middle ground, but both sides cannot occupy it at the same time. The size of the battlefield depends on the size of the armies, and the most engrossing battles are usually those fought with 10 or more units per side."\n\nhttp://www.opnoobs.com/review/victory-and-glory-napoleon","March 29","true","13.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game was released on March 17 and there is still no official patch to it (there is beta patch since a month now, I can't call that good support).\n\nThe core of the game is quite nice, but there are glarrying issues (especially AI in battles, which is really bad, extremely predictable and exploitable) and the game just doesn't offer that much. I could recommand the game if it was 10 €, but not for 28 €, that's way too much for the content you get.

Every time I did it, it was the same thing - high price, not that deep gameplay and very little post-release support.\n\nHowever, if you don't care about price that much (or, unlikely, there is a good promo when you read this), the game is still fun for several hours and you can try it.
