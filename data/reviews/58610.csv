Why?\n1. zoom system means that you can scale what you see from the entire battlefield to the regimental markings on a single tank - vast improvements over the RUSE system as well, the funny counters no longer appear\n2. each battle escalates as it progresses BUT unlike RUSE which had a semi Age of Empres resource system, units appear appear from off of the board\n3. the whole meta-game, for the first battle you play you actually only have a few units available, you need to unlock others as you complete the campaigns, play other people e.c.t. - your strategy will therefore be reflected in your army, did you unlock the artillery, or the helicopters?\n4. I am actually a miniature wargamer, this game is like an epic version of my favourite game in real life - 'Battlegroup:Kursk' - there is a whole supply mechanic which means you have to really plan your offensives, and defensive moves.\n\nIf you like strategy, real strategy, then you may just be looking at the best game ever, I cannot praise it enough. If you are not so sure then I have had friends who have played this game and not enjoyed it so much: it can be confusing, complicated and annoying at first, but getting past the learning curve is well worth it.","October 14, 2014","true","22.9"," 67 of 72 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","67","72","0","0"

Wargame: European Escalation, is the BEST title in the Wargame series IF you are a fan of old-school RTS like I am. This game stays truer to its roots than any other game in the series. Missing only the base building.\n\n+Good graphics that hold up even today.\n+/-A campaign mode that allows you to mission-by-mission test new units and get the hang of the game mechanics. Unfortunately this campaign isn't very interesting.\n+Truly competitive up to 4v4 RTS battles.\n+Strategic environments where marching tanks into cities is suicide, marching infantry through fields is suicide, and approaching any forest can lead to instant death from what tricky enemy awaits within. Helicopters are a powerful tool indeed, but be careful or else anti-air will take your prized Apache.\n+The sounds of the weapons are something you can feel, they hold up quite nicely.\n+/- PvE is present as you can have matches versus bots that hold up in fun. However just as the campaign was lackluster, the AI is as well. It becomes very predictable and boring without the dynamic of a real player.\n-There's an annoying blue line on the screen that never goes away.\n\nI give this game a 9/10 and will personally deem it the best game in the entire Wargame Franchise. Wheras the newer games really changed how they view "RTS", this game keeps the classic tactical gameplay many of us are used to, minus the base building. My friends all wanted me to play Airland battle (The sequel) though this one kept me hooked. It's so much more of a classic, and I'd definitely recommend anyone play this. Make sure you bring friends though, as this multiplayer is abandoned and dead for the most part.","June 25, 2015","true","21.8"," 40 of 42 people (95%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","95","40","42","4","0"

For SP - here comes longer story.\n\nMany people claim that WG:EE have best SP campaigns. They are story driven and thus appears more interesting than skirmish-like ones. But there is one, massive problem existing - balance. Campaigns were not easy and thats good, since challange is part of having fun. But they are no longer just hard - many got elevated to "impossible" level due to patches, nerfs and, more importantly - massive AI buffs.\n\nAI simply cheats, as the last try to make it "challange". It dont need recon, ignore "line of sight" rules, can replenish ammunition and fuel before your very eyes, spawn units out of thin air, stay invisible next to your own recon units and so on. Performance was boosted in latest patches, making SP campaign missions unbalanced and nearly all old guides obsolete.\n\nThere is no fun in that anymore, just frustration, abusing the system and beding the rules, simply to compete with cheating AI.\n\nI managed to beat the game but was it something to be proud of?

(Actually, it's like most other RTS's, played on a tactical level of warfare).\nThis game has a very realistic feel to it. At all times, all your actions are truly part of the road to the final result of the mission.\nIf anything surprising happens which sets you back, it's because you didn't prepare for it. And surprises will happen, you will be off guard, the AI will hit you hard at some point.\nThere are some unfortunate flaws to make it a truly brilliant game. Win or defeat is not permanent, missions are replayable to improve your score. This game lends itself to make results more permanent. So that win or defeat would influence the war instead of a pre-determined sequence of missions. Unfortunately, Eugen Systems didn't implement that.\nStill, it feels like the Real Time Strategy game we all have been waiting for. After playing it, we are simply waiting for the improvement on it.\n8/10 very good game, a must play for fans of the genre, but still a lot of room for improvement","November 27, 2013","true","16.7"," 33 of 38 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","33","38","0","0"

Wargame: European Escalation is set in the cold war around the 1970's in a Nato vs Pact conflict. This game makes you think, such as what units you will need to use in battle. Sure, having a strong group of tanks is nice but you will also need anit-aircraft artillary in case of an oppenent launching an air attack. From what I have seen, there's always a counter unit to a unit. So basically if your oppenent does things right, he could destroy any of your units and you could destroy any of his. It all depends on the strategy you use. The single player has an interesting campaign and is challenging even on the easiest difficulty. There are not many people playing multiplayer, but you can find at least 1-2 matches a day. You are awarded command stars after completing tasks in mission or leveling up in muliplayer. Command stars allow you to purchase new vehicles for your armies. This will leave you playing for hours so you can unlock the tanks you want or a helicopter that looks cool. This game has a friendly community and I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in RTS games, or just strategy games in general.","December 19, 2013","true","49.2"," 30 of 36 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","30","36","0","0"

Those 3 extra command points aren't worth it. That mission that it told me to do in 20 minutes to me  an hour  and twenty minutes. And it went perfectly.

It was good, not great, but good. I liked that it required a certain degree of strategy aside from "make more tanks, blow people away." which is good.  I disliked the fact that the AI doesnt really change up its beginning round movements at all so that if you replay something you know where everything is going to be from the start. Secondly, I HATE that the AI somehow knows all about my position and troop movements and has acts in turn to counter everything I try to do.  In strategy games that is probably the biggest mistake a developer can make. That doesnt add challenge, it just pisses people off because they're not as clairvoyant as the AI. The player actually needs those scouts and recon units to see jack, while the AI somehow just knows these things and picks off your units making it frustrating to get good scores without playing level over and over.

Really hard and realistic. It is almost like a puzzle game with military units. You have a really hard task to achieve, and very often limited time to achieve it. Most of the time you are outnumbered by a superior enemy and must use the advantages of each unit to complete the task.\n\nThis is really hard core rts simulation with units created to be as close to the real thing as possible. The tactics that the AI opponent uses are also supposed to be realistic, probing etc. But mostly you are outnumbered and have to use the scarce resources at your disposal to win.\n\nThe command and control system, like all rts games are to some degree lacking. You have to both have the overview of the battlefield and also micro-manage units. This can lead to losing control and oversight, and you have to make sure to keep your flanks covered. There is a reason why all (functional) armies have ranks of officers to handle different levels of command. Mostly the units handles themselves intelligently and uses the most effective weapon at the time.\n\nThis game is not for everyone since it is a hard-core simulation game. It is not a casual game. Think of it as ARMA only as a RTS. However if you really like strategy games/rts games or are a military "buff", I would recommend it. It is periodically on sale for 50-75% off since it is a few years old, so I would reccomend buying it on sale or trying a demo or seeing some youtube videos before buying since it is a game that you will either love or hate.\n\n\nI don´t think there is MP in this game anymore.

For me, it is almost unplayably bad, and I wish I had never wasted my money on it.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are good; it is sometimes difficult to micromanage the orientation of platoons to keep them facing the enemy, and my recon helicopters have an annoying tendency to land whenever they're not actively moving, while I may want them to stay airborne to keep enemy units visible; the inability to set stances, and the rather awkward method of turning off individual weapons on individual units to keep control of who fires what, can be annoying, but I can generally get my units to do what I want.  The graphics are fantastic, making each unit distinct and identifiable.  The music fits the scene nicely, and the single player campaign storyline is nicely plausible.\n\nSo why do I call it terrible?  Becuase of the awful, terrible, abysmal AI.  In single player, the game becomes almost unplayable, all thanks to the AI's absolute omniscience.  Don't get me wrong, AIs have been able to see all the units on the field right back to the dawn of the RTS era, but it was generally not that big a deal.  In Wargame, however, recon is a central element of any army's tactics.  It requires careful attention to the type of recon vehicle, and equally careful scouting of suspected enemy strong points to avoid putting your recon vehicle in harms way.  The AI does none of that.  It just drops a full attack force directly on top of you, knowing exactly where all of your forces are at all times.  it is even worse in the campaign, where the AI will face you with overwhelming numbers in every mission, often pre-positioned in ambush sites that you can take no advantage of.  This severely reduces the tactics available, and ends up in a situation where the only way to make any sensible progress is by spamming the Quicksave key every time something doesn't go horribly wrong.\n\nI play single player.  I enjoy playing single player so I can take my time and explore my options.  But this game makes single player a horrible, crippled experience that is more like a chore than a game.  For your own sanity, Avoid at all costs.","June 24, 2014","false","71.5"," 50 of 84 people (60%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","60","50","84","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ubiquitous/recommended/58610/","ubiquitous","Ubiquitous","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ubiquitous/","358 products in account","Excellent game. This is, in my view, the best of the Wargame series, despite being the oldest. The reason is that this is the only entry in the series with a proper single-player campaign.\n\nThe seuqels, Airland battle and Red Dragon, dropped the scripted campaign in favour of a dynamic campaign. On the face of it, a synamic campaign sounds great—it's different every time so you get infinite replayability, right? The problem is that the campaign battles in those games are little more than glorified skirmishes against AI bots. European Escalation, on the other hand, has a fully-scripted campaign where a real, human designer has taken the time to think carefully about the narative that links the missions together, the design of the maps to support the specific missions that take place there, and the placement of each individual enemy unit. The result is a much tighter, more compelling single-player experience. in fact, I would say that this game is one of the top three single-player RTS games of all time.\n\nA key draw for the Wargame series is the multiplayer. European Escalation's multiplayer is good, but Airland Battle and Red Dragon are probably the better multiplayer games—they have more unit variety and more active communities. Multiplayer in Wargame is fantastic, so you should definitely check those two sequels. But anyone interested in a single-player RTS experience could do much much worse than giving European Escalation a shot.","May 22","true","54.7"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

In this RTS game, instead of focusing on resource gathering and management or building up a base, you have a "deck" of units to work with. You can customize these decks with units you have unlocked. And once you start a match with a deck you can only use those units in the fight. You only have a limited number of each unit so don't just spam tanks or artillery units because you will run out very fast. In order to win you have to achieve a certain amount of points (ex:3500pts). You get points by destroying enemy units. Don't spam units and expect to win. You can't win with only tanks. You have to flank, use combined units to force your way into enemy controlled areas. Does the enemy have a heavily defended sector? Bombard them with artillery to dwindle there force and then move your garrisons in.\n\nYou also have to worry about fuel and ammo. You will need a constant supply of ammo trucks to keep your units functional.\n\nSome cons I do have with the game are in fact the decks. It can be kind of tedious or grindy to have to unlock all of the units. It would be much easier to have them all unlocked at the start and just let you build it. But instead you are constantly playing matches to get stars to unlock better units.\nAnother slight issue would be the learning curve. The game doesn't really explain itself well so trying to figure out what is what and what does what can be confusing at first and may be a turn off for some players.\n\nOver all I would rate this game 8/10. Very fun.","September 2, 2014","true","13.4"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","8","9","0","0"

The first Wargame from Eugen boasts many units, a compleate multiplayer experience, and campaign that is very well developed and quickly challenges you in very fun and well developed scenarios. Community is small and can involve some crazy elitist like players.\nStay away from this game if you're easily fustrated and the campaign will challenge some of the best players. Where some missions will have some daunting secondary objectives which will challenge completionists while not making the campaign fustratingly hard. Not making it into Air land battle's dynamic campaign system.\nGrab it on a good sale if you enjoy any realistic Rts game, No base building here all about your units and how you use them. Not as pretty as Air land battle but More GRITTY!, and lacks Close air support from jets. However this is why it's refeshing and will remain one of my favorite games, no doubt will get play time even after the Eugen brings around the Third Wargame.

Ok you don't need to come from Harvard to get to understand basic unit movement and functions. Although understanding how all units can be strategized and played through for minimum casualty or maximum efficiency is really what makes this game shine through and through. The AI is really decent, more in tune with trigger functions and time base functions but one in all the solo game gets really freaking intense as you progress through solo modes and requires you to develop new strategy and so understand how the game is played as well as developing deeper understanding and meaning for each type of unit you can use and in what situation.\n\nDo you get kicked or asked to leave public MPs because you are a low level, yes you are. But you can always open your own public game and you will get to play MP games regardless. Although I strongly suggest to finish all Solo games mode first.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SandmanEnterprises/recommended/58610/","SandmanEnterprises","Shadow Hunter","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SandmanEnterprises/","89 products in account","So, after many different strategies and tactics, I have finally come to an unsatisfying conclusion. This game is a trainwreck.\n\nLet me start off with the good parts about the game.\n\nTHE GOOD THINGS:\nSo, the graphics for a game on a scale such as this are amazing. The overall look of every unit is pretty good and you can clearly see that the developers did try to optimize the game as well.\n\nThere is a decent tutorial system in the game as well. From the first mission, it tells you what you must do and so on, and after the first few missions, the game lets your hand go and lets you think on your own.\n\nThat's just about it for the good things. Time for a good spank.\n\nTHE BAD THINGS:\nSo, let me start off with the enemy AI. In the Singleplayer Campaign, the AI seems to be an all-seeing entity that knows your every move, every tactic and attempted strategy, and immediately counters it, or makes it useless by annihilating your heaviest armored units. It's just impossible to fool this AI, no matter how hard I try, unless I guess where his line is the weakest and blast through there with whatever I can. This kills the overall fun of a fictional conflict RTS for me.\n\nNext up: BALANCE\nThere are some serious balancing issues between units of similar roles in the game, like, the M60 Patton being unable to stand up to a T-60 or a T-72 whatsoever. As an example, I had four M60 Patton's engage against three T-60's, both stock versions and at full HP, however, the T-60's somehow, magically, one-shotted my Patton's, even though both groups had their frontal armor aimed at one another, AND to top it all off, my tanks never managed to hit them, despite the distance being probably optimal for late 20th century tank battles - 500 meters.\n\nThird point: COMPUTER GETS AN UPPER HAND\nAt the start of every defense mission, the computer seems to have at least fifteen times more points that it can use to call upon reinforcements than the player. As an example, I was playing ABLE ARCHER's second mission, Ramstein Airbase or something like that, and I was able to call upon only three full squads of my finest armored units, M1 Abrams tanks. I placed them strategically where they were needed the most, but then the AI picked them all off almost 10 minutes after the start of the battle. The tanks were at full health, all of them had Corporal's stripes, but, they were just swarmed over by T-72's with missiles. I couldn't summon any other units because I didn't have a magical point income rate that the AI seemingly has.\n\nFourth: MAGIC INFANTRY\nAs the title says, the game has magic infantry units that can fire hand-held AT rockets on the move. No weapon that I know of is capable of being fired on the move. The result of this on-the-move shot should would fly away from its intended target, really far. And then Infantry is overpowered, by being able to one shot even heavy Main Battle Tanks.\n\nFifth point:\nAll the tanks are horribly underrated or overrated. The M1 Abrams seemingly has really bad equipment, while, to my knowledge, the Abrams was one of the best and most technologically advanced tanks of its time when it first came out. And the T-80 seems to be the single most capable tank of the game, able to utterly annihilate squads of Abrams and Leopard 2 tanks that are even outflanking it. Yes, this actually happened to me.\n\nSixth: TACTICS? I THINK NOT!\nSo, this game promotes a lot of thinking, but this clearly isn't a thinking man's game. It's a cheating man's game. What I mean is, no tactic has any value on the battlefield whatsoever. For example, I set my batallion in a formation where my flanks are stronger than my middle, to make sure that I can outflank my enemy and surround him in a powerful pincer move. But that doesn't work because the AI can do whatever the hell it wants and summon units out of nowhere to outflank my tanks and one-shot them all with incredible accuracy.\n\nSeventh: ACCURACY\nSo, why do all of the player units suddenly have godawful accuracy and spotting range? I counted that at least 83% of all of my shots missed while they were in optimal engagement range, but for the AI - 67% was a miss at long range. The statistic is clearly showing how the AI wins in this and I am fully aware that the statistics for both factions are more or less balanced. It's still ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.\n\nEighth: MICRO- AND MACRO-MANAGEMENT\nThis game supports management on a small and massive scale, and it's applaudable. Games like this are a rarity and ones that execute it perfectly are a luxury among the rare ones, but Wargame isn't that luxury. The management is a huge distraction because your units have no versatility and they can't think for themselves. They're literally civilians given a gun and then shooting anything that moves, not trained soldiers that must do what they're told to do.\n\nMy personal verdict:\nDon't waste your money on Wargame, get RUSE instead. Or better yet, if you want a Cold War-era game, get World in Conflict. It is a far better game, executed masterfully, unlike this poor excuse for a ''Wargame'' where everything is out of place.\n\nNOTE: Don't give me that ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that I must suck in this game. I've been playing RTS games for ages, and this game simply does NOT in ANY DARN WAY reward tactical/strategic thinking. It's all RNG.","September 9, 2014","false","11.2"," 71 of 131 people (54%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","54","71","131","6","3"

The first missions will try to teach you how to play the game, but it's really going to require alot of guessing and clicking on your part to figure out what's actually going on.  The game basically has so much information in the form of detailed stats on each class, nation, and type of vehicle that you will have to meticulously study it to get any kind of proficiency when planning your battles. This game requires you to actually resupply and refuel your units with logistics and this is every bit as painstaking as it sounds.  Terrain matters,  unit optics matter, armor matters, weapon range matters, weapon types matter.  It's very complicated, but the satisfaction of success on the field is worth the mind boggling scope of what you have to keep track of, which is why you shouldn't play this alone.

The trickiest thing for a new player to over come the menu looking like a christmas light show with lots of annoying people stood in the way whilst everything confusingly flashes above. I payed the game and realised it didn't auto save, so i played the game again and the menu being confusing as it is, didn't save. so third time lucky I finished the first two missions for a third time. I realised that hiding anything that moves in a forrested area means it can fire again and live another day as tanks, aircraft and men can fire several kilometers across fields and have an accuracy of a German pornstar on an American beach. Eventually the game started to get rather complex and I bought some shiny new vehicles are recieving the special stars for being a good boy and taking time to move some of my units from A to B.\n\nSeveral minutes of watching an anti aircraft vehicle take many accurate but pointless potshots at a meerely observing enemy chopper I realised the wooded areas are like training wheels on a bicycle. Moving away from them makes all your units run away, yes run away and the poor men feeling "worried" and "doubtful" it's good to know the men are worried as I send 15 tanks towards an enemy fuel truck whilst infantry fire from miles away with incredible accuracy.\n\nOr that they all run out of fuel and sit there defending the same field for the rest of the game whilst I call in extra troops because the supply trucks loose their supplies within seconds of leaving the deopt because they supply practically every squirrel with nuts and every mole with fresh contact lenses and you find your trucks moving back and forwards like a tetris game gone wrong when you place a long piece at the side of a 3 block and it dosen't quite fit.\n\nOver all the game is interesting and the voice overs are amusing, if anything the maps are too big for the units and it becomes a pain to hunt for enemies and you find yourself out of fuel in various parts of the map. There are newer games but people are talking about them like they are out of date milk and are looking for somone to come and find the lumps in it like enemy units on this game.\n\nBravo!\n\n6/10 because I like how the chinooks land when you don't use them for a while!","December 12, 2014","true","7.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","58","7","12","12","0"

I'm not talking about that. I'll have perfectly healthy, calm units near a FOB or maneuvering across empty terrain and they can't follow simple instructions. I've had infantry refuse to get in transports right next to them, infantry refuse to move out of cover, units deciding to stand out in an open field when I've explicitly clicked on cover, tanks turn around and move in the opposite direction I wanted them to for no apparent reason, and units just simply not responding to move orders at all.\n\nSpeaking of moving and cover, apparently there is supposed to be some kind of automated snap-to-cover system in place. I've seen it work once or twice, but usually I end up with half the troops in a given unit hanging out in an open field as the rest of them hunker down in a tree line. The game lacks any way to tell units which direction to face or what kind of a formation to take; a major oversight given that the game seems to be designed to explicitly discourage unit micromanagement.\n\nWhich is frustrating because the AI is terrible. Units will fire on anything that gets within eyesight, regardless if they can hit it or not. I remember one instance where I told half a dozen helos to sweep an area. They moved about one hundred feet, saw a single T-55 tank way off in the distance, came to a screeching halt, and unloaded every single rocket at it. They did little, if any, damage to it and I had to empty out most of a FOB to rearm them. Anti-tank infantry will fire off every missile they have at anything even remotely in range, and given the computers indecisiveness this usually means they expend every single rocket (with zero effect) before the opfor vehicles get into a more reasonable range. (I know the player can 'turn off' the weapons of the units, but then it's just back to micromanaging everything again.)\n\nThat isn't to say the computer is smart - it's not, it's as dumb as a brick. The developers seem to have known this, so they compenstated (in the singleplayer campaign at least) by putting an absolute metric fudge ton of enemy units on the maps. Players are easily outnumbered four to one, by my estimate. The only counter to this is just throw massive groups of units at the computer - the enemy can't call in new units, you can - but this mostly ruins the entire 'strategy' element of the game. Your units are as dumb as the computers (see above), so any attempt to set up kill zones or perform interesting maneuvers is usually thwarted by some IFVs or tanks or something deciding to wander off on their own, or charge in, or just plain not move.\n\nTo add to the problem the enemy tend to be super-human. One particularly notable example I can recall: I was moving into a small town and a single enemy infantry squad had set up in a house on an outer corner. Nothing special; just some rifles, grenades, and some RPGs spread among about twenty soldiers. Ten minutes later I had lost sixteen Leopard 2 tanks, and managed to whittle the unit (which had been under direct fire from the tanks the entire time) down to two guys. I sent in four Huey gunships to clean up and lost them all within five seconds to two guys with rifles who were hunkered down in a pile of gravel and splintered 2x4's. I shelled it a bit with artillery and ran away. I don't know if I ever actually cleaned them out.\n\nOh yeah, and the maps are heavily scripted. It varies from map to map, of course, but usually there is a massive attack wave or reinforcements, or something that will spawn when the player invades a given objective or moves past a specific point. One of the early missions the player is supposed to secure a collapsed bridge with a command unit early on. Thing is, if you never capture that objective the reenforcement wave never comes in, which leaves the player with as much time as they like to build up a massive force or just bypassing the objective entirely. It feels like cheating, but in some cases it seems like the only way to complete the map.\n\nThis game tries to sell itself as the ultimate strategy game but fails miserably. It seems like the developers couldn't decide if the player should micromanage their army or not, and as a result the units are stupid and the controls are frustratingly incomplete. The graphics are pretty good but given that this is the second game they made with this engine (R.U.S.E. being the first) I'm not surprised. I am extremely impressed by the level of unit detail they've built in, which makes the badly designed controls and pitiful AI seem all the more vexing.\n\nNot recommended. I suggest World in Conflict as an alternative, if you're a fan of 198X-era wargaming. It's not nearly as detailed in terms of units but the singleplayer plays a lot better. In my opinion anyway.","September 9, 2014","false","7.4"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","0"

After the first couple of levels the game uses foes (Usually russian) that are way beyond the level of units you are able to aquire. Also, the numbers of enemy units are several times what yours are. For instance: During a recent game, the axis sent 24 Mi24v Helo's against ONE small group of my attackers.  That does not include the other Helo's of the same type that I had already seen and shot down.  It is EASY to get lost in this...meaning, if you have to jump around some of the larger maps, it's easy to forget where a particular unit is located. (Easily fixed by allowing players to view a list of currently used units) Also, there is no access to play as the axis side that i could find.\nWith a little more thought about the player and his/her experience, this could easily be avoided or corrected. An excersize in frustration.....","June 22, 2014","false","266.7"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","0"

Aside from the tedious micromanagement which may appeal to some hard core sim fans out there, the sound effects are simple and copied from unit to unit and the game is unimmersive and bland. Hardcore war-sim fans may like it, however, I refuse to believe that a tank driving for a single mile and depleting all of it's fuel is "realistic".","June 8, 2013","false","46.8"," 17 of 32 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","17","32","0","1"

You can bring units into battle, but at a fairly slow rate, and only from controlled board edges. Posistioning and unit composistion are key.\n\nHas a nice campaign as well, set in the cold war, which allows a choice of which units are avavilable, as well as only have a limited number of each unit. Makes keeping them alive from one mission to the next important, which adds to make the whole thing more tense.\nHas a fairly decent variety of different missions as well.\n\nShould be a definite buy for anyone into combat strategy.","July 14, 2012","true","19.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It has amazing graphics, tons of units, and a very realistic campiegn that alligns it self some what to historical events!\n\nPros\n\n- tons of units\n- interesting realistic campeign\n- multiplayer\n- amazing graphics can be ran on a small computer\n- fun AI matches for practice\n- AH-64 Apache\n\ncons (no game has no cons)\n\n- like most RTS games this one has not developed an easy way to control units. The units are completely controlled by you, and will not function with out you every instruction. This is hard to do when you are trying to coordinate multiple groups at one time.\n- VERY HARD, this game is brutal with new players. It took me a while to finaly figure most of it out, but I'm not too good yet\n- a moral system, this system is very daring, and creative. It makes it so when a unit is under a lot of fire it can get scared, and run away with out listening to you. Unfortunatly this "Routing" is very annoying. Somtimes infantry can route for 5 minutes longer when the fighting stopped. Also units will route in the direction of the enemy. This feature can make the gameplay annoying, and I hope they fix these problems in future games...\n- I suggest watching Youtube if you are stuck on a mission, because they get very hard...\n\nThis game over all is very fun, and I love the graphics, units everything!

The learning curve is extremely steep, and the gameplay is fast and unforgiving. Unless you have a friend to guide you along, it is very hard to understand - even with the basic tutorial. I still feel as if I'mm at the bottom of a cliff with a UAV. I can see what's at the top of the learning curve, I just don't know how I'm going to climb there...\n\nI enjoy the massive battles that occur in this game, and the realism is fairly high.

The only con is the steap learning curve, but it's well worth the time invested once you figure out how to compete in multiplayer.\n\nSadly the multiplayer community has pretty much died out, meaning you're only going find full matches on peak hours.","April 9","true","144.9"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Overall its a fun game, but its mainly a multiplayer game and that multiplayer community has gone on to the newer games.\n\nThe single player campaign is just kind of tedius and not fun and it really feels out of order as well.  You can only play against one ai opponent so not much entertainment as far as playing the ai etc.  Overall i hate to say it but i have to give a good game here a thumbs down recommendation.\n\nWhich is a real shame.  This game has an impressive and realistic unit and weapon selection, the maps have a nice natural look to them, and the game makes you resupply your vehicles as weapons/fuel are depleted which gives you a feel for the nightmare of logistics for a modern army, and i think that is a very cool angle to go after.\n\nIm sure it was great when it was new, and you might try the new games, but i wouldnt recommend old games in the wargame series.  Theres just not all that much to do in them now that the community is playing the newer games.","October 24, 2014","false","34.3"," 19 of 37 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","19","37","0","0"

It looks fine, sounds fine, plays fine, controls fine, but I found it extremely hard and unfair. I play a lot of stragegy games and I like a good challange, but this game for me was very hard to play because you have little to no chance. Your units seem to be worse than the enemies' units, which would be fine, except they out number you about 10 to one. No matter how many units I call in, they always seem to have ten times as many units, and plus they have air support often when you don't, and captuing and holding an objective is hard enough, and gets even harder when you have to defend three points, while outnumbered, out gunned, and out maneuvered. I nveer got past level three or so, and I gave this game MANY tries, but I could never pull through, as misions can last for hours, with little to no progress made. As much as I want to like this game, I can't, and I have to recommend somehting like "Men of War: Assault Squad 2" or "Star Wars Empire at War"  or "World in Conflict" as opposed to this when suggesting a good RTS. Maybe I'm just REALLY bad at this, but I've played a LOT of RTS games, some of which can be very punishing (Men of War on veteran difficulty) and in those I still felt that I had a chance and could make progress and win, but in this I fight for hours and gain nothing but keep losing everything...","October 3, 2015","false","5.5"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","46","6","13","3","0"

Which was sad becuase when I 1st loaded it up I was very excited after playing through the 1st mission.\n\nI would love the hard LOS rules and need for recon if the AI seemed to play by the same rules. Early in the second mission I got swept by some tanks from my 4 o clock, who seemed to have no problems shooting through areas that completly blocked my tanks LOS. Later in the mission My units seems to be utterly incapable of lining up with cover. I had a tank plt where one tank on one end insisted in hanging out in the open while the far tank refused to leave the woods and none of them seemed interested in engaing the fricken T-34s from there max range who were in the open. which leads me to another gripe. Why cant I give orders as to when my units will open fire?\n\nIf im playing an arcade RTS that doesnt track ammo I dont care if every one blows through ammo. However in a game that tracks ever single round it maddening to watch a line of tanks blow half there ammo at max range shooting at a 5% hit chance aginst units who are no where near being able to fire back. A few minutes later the same unit justs decides to watch a few ancinet T-34s as they waltz across an open field and actualy get a hit on my Cheiften before my guys decide to return fire.\n\nThe resupply system is just horrible. Nothing like watching your recon elements run out of fuel over and over and over. And if your going to make resupply a critical aspect of the game you need to give me control over it. Its kind of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ to tell me I have to hold a line aginst tanks and then watch my tanks get ammo starved becuase other units are buring resupply to refuel.\n\nResupply also hoses combined arms. I wanted to use my IFV to suppres infantry so my tanks could kill tanks. Except my IFV were hell bent on blowing 20mm rounds on T-62s which blew through my resupply which starved my tanks. In the end I either had to "turnoff" my IFV or send them to the rear.\n\nMost of this crap wouldent be that annoying IF the computer followed the same rules. but watching a T-55 hold off 3 Cheiften IIs becuase of the "magic of resupply insta repair" pretty much tanks the illusion of realism","April 9","false","3.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"

At the campaign, you have very limited troops and resources, while the CPU can spawn units forever as long as they have the reinforcements points. So you either rush or die. I don't appreciate STRATEGY when you have to rush.\n2. Multiplayer, well ... you know how RTS multiplayer go, but in wargame it is worse because of the limited everything, so only the hardcore players will do anything, a casual player like me have no chance.\n3. There are zillions of bugs on the border areas. For instance, enemy units that retreat (rout) outside the map cannot be easilly target, and worse yet, they might just stay there. I lost a couple of cames because some stupid enemy unit retreated near a reinforcement point and any/all supply truck I called in was immediatly captured, but since they spawn outside the map, I could not send troops to capture them back. Some enemy units go to far outside the map you can't even scout/see to try and siege them, wtf\n\nSo: campaign: you are infinitelly capped against an infinite oponent, so you have to win while you have troops; multiplayer: hardcore made even more hardcore.

Here is a game that has what I wanted in a strategy game. Unit formations, experianced units that carry over and a touch of thinking on how to complele a mission. here is the problem. You have no advanage what-so-ever. yes you may have a unit of heavy tanks supported by anti air and either gunships or artillery. But when that really means something your units don't use the initiative thats been given them. such as 10-1 odds where you have ten units firing at four, the out com should be opfor loss. No the same four vehicle unit rides right up to you one and only command unit holding open your reenforcement window and takes it out with a guided missile at point black right infront of all your heavy tanks, anti- armor and and duel purpose anti air artillery. There goes the reenforcements needed to resupply and and other command you its you wanted to purchace. As for supplies thats the hardest thing to use sence every thing runds on supplies, there isn't enough of it to utilize to either complete all the objectives in the time alloted or to hold out with. AI is horrible when you have a hardden veteran who panics at the first initial contact and routs right but the command unit it was protecting thus exposing it. I would think a unit that's been through so much fighting would realize that I've survived this long in this heavy tank that my crew can it a flea at three miles away while it is moving wouldn't panic when the action starts. And lets not forget the coversystem for vehicles. You can hole them up in a forest or a town but the element of surprize seemes to be the trade off for range. Once in cover the range is reduced for some silly reason. and when the enemy spots you with recon a tank unit can roll right up and shell you at the same distance you could normally fire. Don't get me wrong. This game has a tutorial, the first campaign under the west germans allows you to learn how to use units. But when you get to gunships, they just don't seem to hack it when fighting softer targets. lets also not forget to mention units sitting OFF MAP and still controlling territory and firing away at your units WHO CANNOT FIRE BACK. Really? I lost a whole heavy tank unit to a tin can APC who just so happenes to be sitting at the edge of the map and I cannot kill them? Who test played this game? Ignored the indications where you set the objectives and FOB next to these out of reach tangos? If the Developers would take alook at these flaws and probably patch them maybe this game would have a chance? I'm not recomending this game to those who want a game where they can sit back and relax. this has all the qualities for Rage quitting. Which I've been doing for four days straight since buying it and the whole collection. For Fast play and russhing with no strategy. I recomend it because if you don't care about your losses or the chance to carry over experianced units. then build all your tanks and rush them. the russian AI does it.","February 12","false","27.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Well balanced, with excellent gameplay mechanics and a variety of strategies and play styles to chose from, unlike many RTS which favour specific build orders or tactics. Wargame also provides a challenging single player campaign that is relatively difficult to complete. This game is also very in depth and is far from mundane. Cheap units, if used correctly and positioned well can turn the tide of battle against far stronger and more expensive units.

I like how certain units do better in certain surroundings, like tanks are great in open areas or hedges, helicopters dominate in open areas, infantry rule the cities/towns/buildings, ATGM and other anti-tank units do well when behind woods on an open field.  My only problem is that sometimes the game becomes too challenging to the point where no matter what you do(brings in 10000 tanks to hold alpha objective) you can't seem to win(all the tanks die from one helicopter that they cannot seem to hit ever). Still graphics are extremely good and no unit rules all of them(unless its a helicopter and you don't have AA guns). Oh and btw storming a city with tanks will never work for you but works most of the time for the enemy.","July 22, 2015","true","36.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","2"

That game is not that! Its the most horrible strategy game what i ever try!\n\nOne thing what good:\nGraphic is good, but that is all positive in the game!\n\nThe bad!\nUnit controll and command!\nI never see RTS game with that trash unit controll.\nWhen you command to stop the units move a half kilometer before stop!\nWhen you say, Attack! If you lucky day, the unit MAYBE! start shooting, but 80% of the time, blocked view, out of range, not visible enemy and other ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ts like that.\n\nAND YOU HAVE A LUCKY MOMENT and the unit start firing, the half of the shoots are missing. What that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ crew in the tanks and other vehicles, is not hit a standing target in 1,5 km WITH THAT ARMANENT TECHNOLOGY!\n\nOther, the most fantastic in that "GAME"! The Artillery and Helis.\nThe artillery units need 20 shoot for one hit. In real an M109 Paladin able to firing only one shoot out of 5 km and not MISS!! But here all artillery its a useless ♥♥♥♥!\n\nThe helis is the other useless trash in the game. Fly like an idiot, not see the enemy with heat scanner and other high technology, but a few peasant with rpg able to kill half thousand heli befora you know where the enemy. Pathetic!\n\nAnd the moral system is the third funny thing.\nA T-80U tank taking hits from a simple APC what never can kill a tank, the tank crew going crazy like ♥♥♥♥♥es and running  to the enemy in front like an idiot and you cant controll it! Why? Easy! Its going crazy and fear.... TROLOLOLOLOL!!!\n\nA Tank crew why fear from an APC? Okay, apcs have weapon against armored units, but please! The ATGM rocket need time for hit, but in the game the APCs using primary their Autocannon what only 25mm and NOT 250000mm. ITS CANT DESTROY A TANK!!!\n\nThat game its a Joke! For that price its steal!\n\nNever buy! If you want a real strategy, buy other but not that!","October 25, 2015","false","26.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I have a history with RTS games, and while not my favorite genere, I was looking forward to a 1980's Cold War game that would allow me to move units around and let the computer do all the math for me. I also spent a number of hours watching the Youtube videos about this game and none of the issues that I found are in the vidoes or comments.\n\nPro's\nIts pretty if you zoom in and watch the units, of course to do that you lose contact with the rest of the map.\n\nCon's\nThe manual holds only the basic functions and does not explain the Deck, Reinforcements, Stars or Points.\nThe scenarios allow you to gain points which allow you to unlock types of units. From there you should be able to add them to a battle. However when you are in a battle, you get points, but you are limited to a certain number of units, which appear to be a secret cap number. When you unlock the units, yo only seem to get a certain number and they do not seem to be adjustable.\nControls are managble but not easy and often you click a unit assign it and then when you think you are assigning another unit, you are actually redirecting the first unit.\n\nThis game is also very hard. Even through the five starter scenarios, it was hair pulling hard. When I tried the AI play at easy, I would continually lose. More importantly, there does not seem to be an improvement each time I play it.\n\nI know that many of these complaints mark me as the fault, but this game does seem to be enjoyable to a very close niche of people. So make sure that you are one of those.\n\nOverall, if you think this will be any type of Cold War simulation type game, you will be disappointed. This is a poorer grade C&C with a Cold War skin. I strongly do not recommend this game, even for the $9.99 that I paid.","August 17, 2014","false","5.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

But its just not fun when you have next to no resources and the enemy has infinite resources and infinite reinforcements. When i barely have any starting resources in a campaign, and its one of the hated timed missions, its just not fun. I try to flank and take the not obvious route because the direct route is so heavily guarded and my russian tanks are utter ♥♥♥♥. Still fail because the enemy has reinforcements that come from nearly every edge of the map. The non-timed missions take so long and are just exhausting so i frequently just save and play something else because it becomes so tedious.\n\n","May 29","false","8.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Graphics are nice but where it fails is gameplay, it's just tedious and no fun at all. It was intended as a mixture beetween macro and micro managing your troops on the battlefield but the big problem is they can't effectively fight without your constant surveillance. I.e.  infantry won't take cover in nearby woods if engaged by tanks by itself, you have to tell them to. You have to tell your troops every small detail what to do and how to do it and in real time with so many troops it's simply not possible. Also the troops often execute your orders clumsily what only adds to the problem. The lack of any ai behaviour (beyond starting to fire and fleeing) in your troops is what ruins the game for me.\n\nNon-armed infantry transport and supply trucks are a major nuisance as well since you can't order them to leave the battlefield once they have fulfilled their function. You should be able to tell them to leave the battlefield via access routes.\n\nAlso the armory is not easy to navigate and find troops you need, and having so many type of infantry cards with different transport is also clumsy execution imo. They should have put only infantry by type and then ask you to join desired transport card to them. This would make that part of armory much more clear and less messy.\n\nCommand vehicle model for controling sector is not good either imo, you can spend plenty of time searching for a single hidden command vehicle while you have many troops stationed in the sector yourself, they should have stuck to the control point capping other game use.\n\nI do like some aspects of the game like having to supply your troops, limited number of troops ,access points, terrain effects etc however altogether they don't make a satisfactory game experience in a single player campaign... In multiplayer all players have the same hendicap and problems so I guess most of the problem are nullified however if you're looking for a good single player experience like I did I would advise you to steer clear from this one.","September 6, 2014","false","3.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

I am saying this game felt slow, after having played Total War and Civilization games. I did not like the lack of construction.

Visuals are nice and has a great selection of cold war era weaponry, but in the end the gameplay gets abit boring, theres no excitement, the cover system for your infantry just doesnt feel right and i prob wont be installing it again as theres nothing here that which makes me want to return, sure theres unlockables like new units, choppers are fun to mess around with but after one play through i had had my fun and moved on to the next game and havnt been back since, thats strange for an RTS.

The game gives you zero tutorial so you are expected to not only get on the ground running with no proper training, you are expected to be "pro" at it the exact moment that you start playing the first "mission".  I akin the "training and tutorial campaign" to holding a new born child under water and expecting it to sprout lungs in order to compensate; that is not an exaggeration you will be hard pressed to enjoy this....experience.\n\nThe game touts realism but delivers none of it, it expects you to understand every single nuance about the game's mechanics right out of the gate and best yet, you have to "earn" the ability to call in units to even compete with the painfully obvious cheating AI and its superior units.  Mean while you are forced to defend significant portions of land with some of the most basic and painfully weak units in the entire game yet you are lead to believe that since this is the Cold War going hot that the East and West would be on relatively equal terms as far as preparedness and technology, but no by level two you learn very quickly that the developers know very little about the weapons of war during the time period.  This all carries over into multiplayer which by now is devoid of players, who have since moved on to greener pastures, so have fun playing against either max level players with all of their decks properly filled or....no one, or a friend who you tricked into buying this garbage in order to have someone to play with.\n\nThe general consensus even on this game's FORUMS is to miss this game unless you want the "story', which is the most forgettable thing about this entire game, and buy Airland Battles or Red Dragon.  They both are a vastly improved version of this…lovely package and there is no need to grind for command points in order to play the game.","December 2, 2014","false","6.0"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","0"

And the other 2 (If you unlock the 3rd theater you're a god) Are just as hard if not worse. 90% of the time you're Outgunned, Outmanned, Outmatched, Out of Resources, Out of hope and ready to smash your keyboard over the level dev's skull, And thats just the start of the mission.

If you are looking for anything remotely like Civilization then keeping on going. This game is not like Civ at all. They made hti sgame way more complicated then it needs to be. I tried playing it and I realized "oh hey, there is a learning curve. Alright I'll try to understand the game". One hour later... "Nah, it's just a piece of s**t. No learning curve, just bad mechanics." For everyone that has played this game and doesn't like the mechanics, you will undertsand what I mean. Why would I want the management of my troops be that complicated?!?!?\n\nAlso, an enemy helicopter took down: 1 AA Gun, 4 tanks, 3 Rifleman, and 2 Recon units. I had to call in 2 more AA guns and 3 anti-air infantry units to take down the enemy helicopter. Balanced much? And finally, the hidden units. Really f****** annoying when I'm just going along and then BAM! 3 enemy units appear out of now where and take down half my strike force in the area. And ya, I had recon units with me but enemy still hidden far enough away that it didn't matter.\n\n3/10, could be a lot better but the dev's must have skipped community testing.\n\nP.S.

It is to some degree but this game kinda kicks itself in the behind by forgetting the basics of an open world RTS.\n\nThe game is terribly restrictive despite being an open map RTS, your troops are goverened by 4 factors - Physchological state, ammo, fuel, repair status. Fuel runs out within mere minutes, you cant traverse  the map without having to refuel once or twice. Most missions do not even give you the ability to refuel your army unless you are lucky enough to capture a suply depot. So far it makes sense doesnt it, but here is the restrictive part.\n\nAs expected the A.I. is automatically in control of these supply depots and so they are heavily reinforced, making you use tactical moves to beat the A.I. However you run out of fuel in doing so, so you are forced to go in head on. Ta Da problem is here. The A.I. being a computer some how has 100% accuracy with their weapons so the only way is to outgun them in order to win...oh dear, you are always out gunned in the first place so here is 1st catch 22 situation.\n\nSecdonly you do not really have the choice of what units to deploy, there is a pre-determined list of which you can select (unlock) units or not.\n\nIts a tediout game, not worth the time and trouble. Buy R.U.S.E which is absolutely fantastic, and is extremely similar to this game in terms of game interface and strategy requirements.\n\nFinally one aspect which really didnt make sense to me...you are play as part of NATO...a group of countries whos military power and resources easily rivals that of the USSR and its allies...why on earth is the game giving you only 5 tanks to take on 40 tanks??\n\nIt would have been a far better game if there was some way of obtaining more units, maybe in the style of World In Conflict or even R.U.S.E. Instead cant help but feel this game suffers from COD syndrome...one man army against the world.\n\nAVOID THIS GAME LIKE THE PLAGUE!!\n\nI understand that i may have only played this game for 1.5 hours on record...however it has been much longer, and being an RTS fantatic...do understand the difference between good ones and bad ones as have experienced them.","November 15, 2014","false","7.3"," 0 of 11 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","11","0","0"

It can be extremely difficult at times, but there's a lot of youtube help out there. You unlock units with stars and ♥♥♥♥, which is kinda cool/annoying. Once again there is youtube advice out there on what to unlock first. Since it isn't $50, I recommend it. Looks cool and is fun to play. Play the first 5 solo missions first to get a feel for it. Multiplayer is fun, but you'll need some unlocks first, so tackle the singleplayer first.","February 5, 2015","true","38.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's no basebuilding, no offsite artillery or airstrikes, no fancy RUSE cards - all you get are the units you spawn in and what you call in as reinforcements.  The units handle rather realistically too - many of the units have the strengths and weaknesses they have in real-life.\n\nKeep in mind though, it's not completely realistic.  Some abstractions were made for the sake of balance, a good example being the supply units.  Any type of supply unit and repair, refuel, and rearm anything on the field, until it runs out of supply points.\n\nOverall, if you're tired of the typical base-building RTSes or games that are more about your APM/ build orders, then you'd definately find the game to be a fun change of pace.","June 26, 2012","true","124.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Uses the IrisZoom engine that RUSE used.  Set in the time period after Vietnam, the Cold War becomes a Hot War and you are put in command of NATO forces and PACT forces.  NATO includes the USA, Great Britain, West Germany and France.  PACT includes East Germany, Czech, Poland and of course the USSR.  Most notable is the scale of Wargame.

Try to send in other tanks to take out the tanks the scouts were able to spot - gets killed by another 20 enemies on the way there. Try to sneak anti-tank infantry through the trees to take out as many as I can - Infantry misses EVERY shot and has to fall back for more ammo. Theres no way to win it seems.

Fully real-time, Wargame is a RTS game focusing on a fictional escalation of the Cold War into a full-scale war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.\nThis game features zero base-building. Positioning (flanking, cover, ambushes) is everything: several well-placed infantry units in a forest can wreck enemy tanks, and a pair of hidden heavy tanks can tear up targets from long range. Deployment of units is handled with command points, gained through control of sectors.\nThe starting allocation of units is determined by your active deck- one deck for the NATO player, and one deck for the PACT player. Decks are expanded through Command Stars, gained through campaign progress and multiplayer EXP. New units, such as the T-80 tank or the ubiquitous M1 Abrams, are purchased with Command Stars.\nThe game is tough and has a steep learning curve, but few games are more satisfying to master.","August 2, 2012","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are top notch; missiles fire off rails, turrets turn, guns recoil, terrain burns, etc.  Helicopter in troops to set up ambushes inside buildings or carefully maneuver a group of tanks across a narrow bridge to surprise the enemy in a flanking maneuver!  As you play, you gain xp both for yourself and your units.  Units are persistant through the single player campaigns, and there's a finite number of them, so the game emphasises on limited casualties.  As you gain in level, you pick up unlock points which you can use to unlock more advanced units of your choosing to customize your forces significantly.  The DLC's added a powerful Co-op mode to fight the AI, which is amongst the best I've faced in an RTS.  Great fun for up to 8 players!","July 22, 2012","true","96.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Why?\nFirst off, let me state that it is not forgiving. How is that good? Allow me to explain.\nBecause it is not forgiving and punishes every error you make, you feel the need to always play at your best, lest some AI or player exploit said mistakes. That's what keeps this game fun. You have to be quick witted and find yourself always thinking ahead. It's not StarCraft II where one may spam production of resources and single units for a cause. You are given a handful of units and are practically ordered to work with what you've got to accomplish the objective. Attrition takes a heavy toll for all combatants in this game, only furthering your need to ensure you get it right the first time.\n\nThe games major strong points are its challenging AI, extremely fun multiplayer, and never-tiring gameplay.\n\nThe gameplay is among the most realistic available. Is it lifelike? No. However, the weapons, damage, and effects represents what you'd expect a tank shell to do to a light armor vehicle. Send it up in a shower of sparks and smoke. This only enforces the need to protect your supporting units and counter opposing units in a rock-paper-scissors-spock game of real time chess. Each unit has its strengths and weaknesses. Each unit can be used to determine victory or outright failure in a match. You're immediately caught in the illusion that you're fighting to protect not only your pride as a commander on the battlefield, but that you're fighting for the lives of your units which will bring you an ever-so-sweet victory at the expense of your enemy's downfall. Winner takes all in this game.\n\nThe campaign explores a Cold War scenario where NATO and the Warsaw Pact go head to head. If history is your kind of thing, and the Cold War happens to be mine, then this is certainly the game for you.\n\nGet it. I guarantee you won't regret it.\n\n\nYes there are some downsides that I will list to show an unbiased opinion:\nSometimes the games can drag on for long periods of time.\nThe AI can be a tad bit challenging on even the most easiest of settings.\nExploits can be made if your competent enough to risk them, bringing and easy and early victory.\nSometimes long games cannot be achieved forcing you to choose the quickest and easiest option to bring victory.\n\nAll in all, this game is still a heck-a-lot of fun.","December 13, 2013","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

NATO includes the USA, Great Britain, West Germany and France.  PACT includes East Germany, Czech, Poland and of course the USSR.  Most notable is the scale of Wargame.

Well designed and masterfully researched, these games are a must own for an RTS fan. If you want to recreate what the cold war played out would be like.... Wargame. If you want to learn about the capabilities of different military vehicals from both sides of the cold war....Wargame.\n\nOn a gameplay front, the game has a short, but steep learning curve, and only minimal tutorials. The difficulty curve on the other hand is rather....monolithic. The single player campaign is challenging and fun, rewarding those that really invest time in the game. Mechanically, the game is very functional. I wish some of the AI were a tad sharper or more clear, but it all works very well. While later games add new mechanics and refinements to the Wargame system, European Escalation is still the most functional of the games and the best way to begin a Wargame experience (Aircraft in Red Dragon operate by some sort of gypsy targeting, difficult to use well).\n\nDon't be discouraged by the difficulty of the campaign, or the initially confusing combat; once you understand how to play this game it is one of the goodies!","May 20, 2015","true","139.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

Very much a classic table-top war game for the digital realm will definitely have fans of this genre wanting to have a try.","December 27, 2013","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The graphics are top notch; missiles fire off rails, turrets turn, guns recoil, terrain burns, etc.  Helicopter in troops to set up ambushes inside buildings or carefully maneuver a group of tanks across a narrow bridge to surprise the enemy in a flanking maneuver!  As you play, you gain xp both for yourself and your units.  Units are persistant through the single player campaigns, and there's a finite number of them, so the game emphasises on limited casualties.  As you gain in level, you pick up unlock points which you can use to unlock more advanced units of your choosing to customize your forces significantly.  The DLC's added a powerful Co-op mode to fight the AI, which is amongst the best I've faced in an RTS.

Do you think you could stop Soviet onslaught with your own NATO battalion? Ask yourself no more, but purchase this game.\nA great mix of an RTS with card game, where you can create your own unit, and then send it to combat against enemy, both AI, or human player.\nDespite being an RTS and not mil sim, with all it's simplifications this is the most realistic game of it's genre (and probably the only such game).\nIt allows you to become commander of brigade size force of either Warsaw Pact or NATO, and take part in some fictional campaigns, or try your skill in multiplayer. Whether you want to rush with 20 T-55, or 2 T-80, you will feel like true commander would have felt during actual engagements. You will face the same decisions, choices and challenges and have to answer them in correct way to achieve victory.\nIf you consider Combat Mission tactical, and Total War strategical, Wargame is the operational level of war. It is like Total War with only battles left. And those are battles in the last moment when most modern equipement was used the same way it was used during World War II. Without drones, laser guided artillery rounds, whose fire is calculated from personal laptops carried by soldiers. It is the last time when strategy meant mass, manouver, and firepower only.","January 11, 2014","true","85.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The maps are large and very well done, the units are accurate and are very detailed, the AI works well enough in my opinion, limiting the need for constant baby sitting, though at times you will find yourself closely watching one or two groups of units because you cant rely on the AI to use them properly.\n\nThe only problem I've ever had with the game is that at times it just becomes too big to warrant a 1v1 game, hell even in the campaign I find myself starring at a giant map that really serves to discourage me.   While not a problem, I find that the overall size of the game can be daunting to people, and is a reason why I don't play W:EE all that much.  Still it is possible to get past the size of the map, and a few other problems in the game (in my own opinion) and enjoy it.\n\nStill, if you're an RTS fan, you'll enjoy this game, it offers some cool features, such as spending command stars to unlock new units for you to use, allowing for different combinations, especially in the campaign. Not to mention that the campaign isn't all that bad itself.\n\n","February 3, 2014","true","6.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wargame is a realistic RTS game with large scale battles and a huge list of units to choose from.\n\nGameplay: Choose units that you want to deploy (from a list of units that is customizable) and choose there locations. Start by capturing sectors for a slow income for reinforcements (sometimes sectors can reinforce too). The team who destroys the most points of units wins.\n\nFew notes: Maps are huge, unit travel can take a while and requires smart positioning. Their isnt much microing and speed involved in this game compared to games like Starcraft but rather involves more strategy in position and right timed attacks.\n\nI'd say this RTS game is great and if you liked any of the games listed above, this game may be worth checking out.","February 11, 2012","true","45.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

After playing the first mission I was pleased but not C&C Generals pleased. Then I've played the second.\n\nDamn this thing is hard. One wrong move and you've lost all your units. And no, compared to Ground Control or War in Conflict, it is rather hard to get your units back. Right now I'm still at level 2 in the middle of the mission.\n\nThen I've tried the multiplayer.\n\nDamn, that was awesome and intense! I've never played anything like it. After wasting half of my units in a stupid rush, the other player told me to stand down. He gave me some instructions and it seemed like no one was doing anything.\n\nHe told me "wait and defend".\n\nThen I've got the idea of getting 8 artillery guns. He gave me some targets and the feeling of crushing entire battalions with every salvo is amazing! We were lead by 1000 points and soon, after I've leveled every enemy position with artillery we were ahead.\n\nIn the last minutes of the game, the other team made a final desperate attack using choppers. In the last two minutes I've bought anti-air, sent it to the target (it is amazing how far anti-air can shoot in this game) and seen all his airforce down.\n\nThe end?\n\nA tie but this was the most intense multiplayer match in my life and believe me, I've played a few.  For hardcore strategy gamers who also have a lot of patience, this game rocks.\n\nPS: I'm playing it on a ultrabook with integrated graphics. I'm getting 30 fps with DX 11 and medium to low settings.

But Wargame is not a game for me, it's to clinical in it's approach & from mission one it was just a snooze fest of relatively pretty but oh so boring units moving around the screen. It lacks the playability & fun of games like the aging Command & Conquer Generals or the brilliiant Company of Heroes, or the future fantasy alternative the Warhammer 40k franchise. Instead Wargame strips away the enjoyment & leaves you with a relatively real but soulless husk of a game to yawn your way through. If however you are in to playing detailed & pretty modern battlefield simulators then maybe this ticks the box for you, but for me it's a 5 out of 10 max and that's solely for the graphics.","December 13, 2013","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not for any fault of the game itself.  Rather, the game is too good at doing what it does, and that is simulate late 20th century combat at the operational level.\n\nThe game will leave you feeling inept, as you barely scrape your way through one mission after another.  Even when you win by a significant margin, completing all objectives you will wonder if you could have done it better.  The loss of prized units is inevitable.  There are too many variables, and never quite enough resources.\n\nThe game piles onto your shoulders increasing responsibility from the command of a few tanks to control of the evacuation of an entire army.

Fully real-time, Wargame is a RTS game focusing on a fictional escalation of the Cold War into a full-scale war between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.\nThis game features zero base-building. Positioning (flanking, cover, ambushes) is everything: several well-placed infantry units in a forest can wreck enemy tanks, and a pair of hidden heavy tanks can tear up targets from long range. Deployment of units is handled with command points, gained through control of sectors.\nThe starting allocation of units is determined by your active deck- one deck for the NATO player, and one deck for the PACT player. Decks are expanded through Command Stars, gained through campaign progress and multiplayer EXP. New units, such as the T-80 tank or the ubiquitous M1 Abrams, are purchased with Command Stars.\nThe game is tough and has a steep learning curve, but few games are more satisfying to master.","August 2, 2012","true","15.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

There's no basebuilding, no offsite artillery or airstrikes, no fancy RUSE cards - all you get are the units you spawn in and what you call in as reinforcements.  The units handle rather realistically too - many of the units have the strengths and weaknesses they have in real-life.\n\nKeep in mind though, it's not completely realistic.  Some abstractions were made for the sake of balance, a good example being the supply units.  Any type of supply unit and repair, refuel, and rearm anything on the field, until it runs out of supply points.\n\nOverall, if you're tired of the typical base-building RTSes or games that are more about your APM/ build orders, then you'd definately find the game to be a fun change of pace.","June 26, 2012","true","124.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Wargame is a realistic RTS game with large scale battles and a huge list of units to choose from.\n\nGameplay: Choose units that you want to deploy (from a list of units that is customizable) and choose there locations. Start by capturing sectors for a slow income for reinforcements (sometimes sectors can reinforce too). The team who destroys the most points of units wins.\n\nFew notes: Maps are huge, unit travel can take a while and requires smart positioning. Their isnt much microing and speed involved in this game compared to games like Starcraft but rather involves more strategy in position and right timed attacks.\n\nI'd say this RTS game is great and if you liked any of the games listed above, this game may be worth checking out.","February 11, 2012","true","45.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Well designed and masterfully researched, these games are a must own for an RTS fan. If you want to recreate what the cold war played out would be like.... Wargame. If you want to learn about the capabilities of different military vehicals from both sides of the cold war....Wargame.\n\nOn a gameplay front, the game has a short, but steep learning curve, and only minimal tutorials. The difficulty curve on the other hand is rather....monolithic. The single player campaign is challenging and fun, rewarding those that really invest time in the game. Mechanically, the game is very functional. I wish some of the AI were a tad sharper or more clear, but it all works very well. While later games add new mechanics and refinements to the Wargame system, European Escalation is still the most functional of the games and the best way to begin a Wargame experience (Aircraft in Red Dragon operate by some sort of gypsy targeting, difficult to use well).\n\nDon't be discouraged by the difficulty of the campaign, or the initially confusing combat; once you understand how to play this game it is one of the goodies!","May 20, 2015","true","139.7"," No ratings yet 1 person found this review funny","0","0","0","0","0"

You can get whatever you want but only if it's less than this". A theater level deployment strategy doesn't work that way. The general draws a battlefield plan to detirmine how many of what is needed to ensure that the frontline can't be outflanked, and executes. Nobody was every stupid enough to deploy 20 tanks, 4 antitanks, and 4 antipersonnels across an area that was several thousand acres and expect them to clear it. Maybe you get enough points to get another 4 tanks in 10 minutes or so. Big deal.\n\nBe prepared to rage quit constantly. Mostly I know why what happened, happened.

If you want a hard game, this game is for you. A lot of people talk about the cheating AI. It is likely that it does, but personally I enjoy the added difficulty. I have a feeling (from many of the negative reviews) that a lot of people don't know how to play this game properly. There is not too much to it, and the tutorial is there. It's called campaign missions 1 and 2. Play and you will learn. The landscape is beautiful, and the military units even more so.\n\nI do have one major gripe with this game. It requires you to get command stars through multiplayer battles in order to unlock all of the units. This seems like a pretty ridiculous requirement, since there are rarely any games going on anymore. You can also earn them by leveling up, but leveling up through playing single-player skirmish takes ages.\n\nI'd recommend this game to any RTS player looking for a challenge.
