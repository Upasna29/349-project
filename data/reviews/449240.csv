It builds on top of the classic game by most notably adding an extra dimension, but the ability to jump also shakes up the classic gameplay and gives a player with fast enough reflexes an out when they would have otherwise died. The leaderboards make it easy to compete against players from all around the world or claim the top spot among friends and the multitude of game modes and maps will give you plenty of opportunities to prove your skills and reflexes.\n\nThe devs have publically stated that even though this is version 1.0 it will certainly not be the end of development for this game and that hopefully with fan feedback they can introduce new features and keep the game feeling fresh.","May 20","true","1.5"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

The music is great, the lightshow is crazy, and the gameplay is so very addicting.  If you enjoy snake, you will def enjoy this game.  I keep trying and trying to beat my highest scores.  Totally addictive.  I also did a first look and gameplay video of the game if you would like to check that out.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0PcfmcnZqF8\n\nEdit: I managed to get a new highest second place in the world on pill time attack, so if you want to see how crazy it gets at around 3mil, def check this short video out.  It does get wild indeed :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwAEBqfuxuw&feature=youtu.be","May 21","true","8.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

What more could you possibly need?\n\nSome small tweaks here and there. For example recognizing a controller if it's being plugged in after the game has been started. Or some settings for dead zone for analog sticks - mine tends to stick a bit to the left side and game would turn me left indefinitely. Moving around the menus with the D-Pad, or selecting levels with bumpers - since they already are used for left and right movement. A lot o small polishes would make this game even more awesome, but it's great as it is. Definitely worth the money. Perfect for a quick game between one task and another","May 21","true","0.9"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Demos for each score would be nice.\n\nImprovements that can be made:\n\n- Game is written with Unity, and the only thing it uses and is not cross platform is XInput for controllers. A linux (and osx) build without controller support would be easy and nice to have\n- More music. Currently there is only one in the game\n- Any arbitary shape, maybe Workshop support or someting?","May 22","true","2.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
