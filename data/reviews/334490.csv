Music and sounds were decent.\n\nGraphically not stellar but certainly passable; hidden object scenes were clear and there was no pixel-hunting or looking for badly-labeled items ("is that blob a football, or is THAT blob a football?" isn't an issue in this game),\n\nSome of the puzzle solutions were downright silly, but I think that's actually what the game was going for.  I'm not thinking that they're taking themselves too seriously here so it's pretty important that players suspend disbelief too.  The solutions do make sense, they're just sometimes... well, silly.  Like I said.\n\nAs the tags clearly state, this is a hidden-object/casual puzzle game, not a full-fledged adventure game.  Make sure you read what you're buying before you buy it and are disappointed.\n\nThe worst thing the game has going for it, honestly, is length.  Since most of the puzzles aren't grossly difficult, I pretty much plowed right through in about two and a half hours.  This makes the $9.99 cost WAY too expensive for what you're getting.  I would not get this if not on sale.\n\nSo in the end, I am going to recommend this as a short, silly HO/puzzler AS LONG AS IT'S ON SALE - there are plenty of better games out there if you're going to pay full price.  But it's by no means godawfully bad, and worth wasting a couple bored hours with.","March 22, 2015","true","2.3"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful","94","16","17","0","0"

And this is to warn all those who like me who love adventure games buy hate the hidden objects screens. These force you to find objects which has nothing to do with the story of the game and hinder its progress. I wish the developers removed those screens so that it whould make a good adventure game.","March 9, 2015","false","0.1"," 23 of 79 people (29%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","29","23","79","12","0"
