The resource mining is automatic and you can use resources to buy defence units (turrets, tanks, planes) or to upgrade the units. Or you can upgrade the base to get different units and more upgrades.\n\nThis game plays on three floors, the ground (turrets and tanks and shield), the middle air (airships) and the top air (planes) and every floor has its own units. Generally each unit only fights against enemies on the same floor but there are bombers (defender and attacker) which drop bombs from the top to both other floors and there are air-defence turrets which can hit planes and airships.\n\nThe game play is fluent and interesting. You can only build one unit at a time and you are limited to 12 so you have to build wisely. But you can destroy misplaced or unused units. You cannot build while upgrading and the other way around, therefore you have to plan in advance.\n\nEvery level in the campaign plays about the same because the attackers are always the same and they always attack on the 3 floors. At the end of each level there will be a different enemy boss which is not very hard to beat.\nOn later level you will start with an upgraded base and get a special defence units which might be helpful against the enemy boss.\n\nI like this game but the content does not justify the price.\nThe campaign is very short (about 3 hours) and the survival mode is boring because you start with a fully upgraded base and the enemies don't get harder.\nAlso it is not possible to replay the levels in the campaign. You could reset your progress in the game but be warned: This does not only reset the campaign, it also resets the records of the survival mode and everything you might have unlocked. So there is no real replay value.\n\nPros:\nGreat visuals\nGood sound\nPolished menu\ninteresting game mechanics\n\nCons:\nCampaign too short\nSurvival mode boring\nNo support for touch screen","January 7","false","4.0"," 59 of 88 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","59","88","0","6"

It's your usual Tower Defense-esque game, think Age of War with a good selection of units and plenty of fast paced enemies ready to bring your whole base crumbling down. It's simple, you build units and towers to hold back enemies while attempting to complete objectives. You can build buildings, upgrade units and unlock more units the more resources you obtain over time. There are some nice things like the graphics which is your usual low rez 16 bit that has become rather popular in indie games nowadays but there are also some rather annoying things like the ludicrously small unit cap or the fact that there even is a unit cap in a game like this. You're already limited in the amount of space in which things can be built, which is fine, but also considering turrets and actual units both occupy unit cap, it gets annoying rather fast. Also, survival mode isn't as good as the campaign so it seems that once everything is complete, there isn't much else to do. Hopefully, as the game is developed, there will be more replayability added to it.\nMy final thoughts, I don't regret buying it, it's not bad if a bit overpriced. I think an even 5 bucks or 4.99 would be a more worthy pricetag of the current product because this isn't really anything you haven't seen before in a game like Age of War.\nGameplay Impressions:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-5B0nth5GU","January 7","true","1.6"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","67","14","21","6","0"

This does not effect my review.\n"Age of Steel: Recharge" is a 2D strategy with a view from the side. You're taking the role of commander, who was entrusted the management of the military base. Your mission is to defend a base from the waves of enemies at any price.\nTags: Strategy, Action, Indie, Casual\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F7fPHgCUcDA\nProsSimplistic pixel art for buildings and units.  I feel that this point the focus more on strategy than looks, which is always nice. The explosions and pixel effects are satisfying.\nVarieties of units and turrets available as you upgrade your base (first upgrade unlocks walls and tanks; other upgrades allow you to enhance your units, build more ground units, and also deploy air units).\nWell-designed menu and UI\n2 modes: survival and campaign. In campaign your goal is to simply beat the levels (there are 14 of them); in survival you have to defend your base from the enemies as long as you can. As far as I know, the levels for campaign and survival correspond.\n6 different land/air vehicles and 5 different buildable defensive structures.\n3 layers in which your units and structures can be deployed. Land (tanks, walls, ground turrets, ect.), Low altitude (light ships, heavy ships, and carriers), and high altitude (bombers, birds, and jets). This means you will have to fend off waves of enemies coming from 3 different sources instead of one (like a traditional TD game).\nVery reasonable price ($7) for the hours you can spend in this game.\nConsAutomatically producing resource system. Because this is a tower defense game, these resources would be more appropriately gained from building collectors, scavenging, or destroying enemy waves. This may not bother some people, but in most levels I end up having an overwhelming abundance of resources that I have no need of.\nCannot go back and replay levels you have completed in campaign mode (maybe this changes when you beat all of them?).\n2D means fewer options for unit and structure placement. This is one of the main limitations this game has, but despite this, it still manages to be as challenging and fun as it is.\nFans of super hardcore TD games that are emphasized on strategy and placement will be disappointed with this game’s approach. The units are not placeable, only deployable. This means that they travel by themselves and sometimes get shot down instantly. Units and turrets also fire constantly, even when an enemy is not around.\nLimited placement. I mentioned some of this above. There is a limited “zone” where you can place your ground units, except tanks (you have no control over the deployable units). Everything outside that zone (2/3 of the screen) is red, and units cannot be placed there. There should at least be the option to place mines or other defensive units (mines are not in this game, I am just using them as an example. Maybe they should add mines though…) in these areas to help slow down the oncoming units.\nSummaryThis is a solid TD game, but not without a few flaws. I recommend that they add achievements (even a few would be nice), allow for more control in unit placement, have a few more ground structures (like mines or machine gun turrets), and make recourses a little more limited.\nI recommend that you buy this game on sale, or at its full price if you are so inclined.\n\nMy implemented rating system:Run away! 1-2/10\nHandle with caution… 3-4/10\nBuy on sale: 5-6/10\nEvery day purchase: 7-8/10\nMust buy: 9-10/10\n\nThis game’s rating: 6.5: best bought on sale or everyday purchase if you feel so inclined.Read the full review here on our website: {LINK REMOVED}http://giveaways.pl/reviews/age-of-steel-recharge/\nVisit our steam group: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/vantom","January 12","true","6.7"," 14 of 21 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","14","21","2","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/421060/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2001 products in account","Hold the line!\nAge of Steel: Recharge is a pretty standard tower/lane defense. Basically the entire game revolves around building land and air units, aswell as upgrading your base in order to defend yourself from waves of The Opposition’s troops. You are in charge of an allied mobile base and in each mission, the goal is to defend key areas to the Alliance in its fight against The Opposition.\n\nThe gameplay is pretty simple. There are three different types of Units, the first one moves on land and that’s where you got your tanks, turrets and walls. The second Unit type is in the water and on this lane the only thing that moves are ships. Finally the top lane is where jets and other aircraft move. Assuming it isn’t a bomber, a Unit cannot attack Units on another lane. This brings some strategy to the game, which makes you manage the amount of units you have on each lane and if you’re able to defend your base from that lane effectively.\n\nNow, there is a few things I found weird about the game, such as the Steam overlay doesn’t work (Fraps framerate counter also appears not to work) and also that there is no way to check the objective for the mission you’re playing. The objective only displays at the beginning of the level I believe. That said, things like having the ability to queue multiple units for construction and clever hotkeys for building specific units are also not present, which I find rather odd, especially on a game like this.\n\nPros:Good looking pixel art (reminds me of Risk of Rain)\nNeat music, suits the game really well\nEasy to learn, very low skillcap\nRuns on a potato (tested it)\nCons:Typos in the dialogue which are rather annoying\nShort campaign (3-4 hours long)\nIt can get repetitive on long play sessions\nOverall thoughts\n\nI feel like the story is there just for the sake of it. The Opposition, the first non governmental army, wants to dominate the world and create a new society in order to achieve global peace and prosperity. On the other hand, the Alliance wants to free the world of The Opposition because they believe their campaign will eventually lead Earth to its demise. If you were looking for a rich setting, you probably won’t find it here.\n\nTo sum it all up, this is not a bad game, but it also isn’t a very good one, the features that are present do what they have to. If you’re looking for a time waster or something to play while you’re bored or in short periods of time, this might be the game for you. If you’re still unsure about it, get it on sale.\n\nRating:\nI would rate Age of Steel: Recharge a solid 7/10\n\nWant more recommendations? Come see our reviews on our favorite upcoming games!

Enemies don't stop coming and you can't stack actions for later, so as soon as you build a turret, a wall or a interceptor, it gets destroyed by a random enemy, it might not sound as bad at first, but after some time, this gets really annoying. I honestly don't know if the resource system is like that because of an error or because the devolpers tried to compensate for the difficulty.\n\nThe problem with this game is that I really want to like it, the graphics are good, the idea is good and finishing a stage is satisfying, but all of it could be done in a better way.\n\nAs a conclusion, I would only recommend this game to someone if they have nothing better to do and want a hard game, otherwise, stay away from this game","February 8","false","2.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

You'll end up spending more time just trying to click, place, and produce units to keep up with the rate at which the computer can throw its endless stream of units at you. It's, ultimately, more a game of about how click you can click than about what kind of strategy you can assemble.","February 6","false","3.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Only the button to turn off the whole sound. Come on! I know it's an indie game, but even android games allows to change sound and music volume.\n\nIt doesn't have hotkeys! You have to click with your mouse all the time. Hotkeys would allow to better micromangament.\n\nIt doesn't have achievments! No achivements in these days? How heartless!\n\nThe game isn't saved on survival mode when you exit!\n\nThere is no speed up button! So with the above, the survival mode can be sometimes a pain in the neck.\n\nI hope this issues would be added in the next updates, making the game better!","January 31","false","1.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

In the near future the world is consumed by the great crisis. The resources of the planet are to end, the traditions mean nothing anymore. It leads to many wars, one after another - places where one could live in peace and not worry about the fact that he can be shot immediately were almost gone.\n\nThe planet was ruined. Years of endless wars almost destroyed countries which we know today. More and more powerful armies were created. The first non-governmental army was called The Opposition. Its' views were clear enough - its main purpose was to create a new society. Without war, without violence, without tyrants. But it was possible only by complete destruction of the old world and civilization.\n\nThe remains of the largest contries were forced to create an organization that could repulse the Opposition. Its name was the Alliance. The Alliance's leaders believed that the Opposition's actions would lead to complete destruction of the Earth and dissapearance of humanity. They belived that because of such actions the restoration of civilization in the future would be impossible. The Alliance protected knowledge that was accumulated by humanity during it's existence. It's leaders considered that the humanity should stop that war.\n\nYou are the commander of the Alliance. Your goal is to take control of the bases in the hot spots and to resist the advancing enemy. - Recommended!","January 7","true","0.3"," 5 of 14 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","5","14","0","0"
