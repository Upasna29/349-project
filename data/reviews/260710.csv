The game's atmosphere is interesting but the gameplay is padded out since there is really only one location you spend all your time in, with differant time line scenarios.  I found myself consulting a walkthrough with most of this game as I was sincerely frustrated throughout. Still, for the price it could be worth your time.\n\nI love adventure point and click first person games...I'm just awful at them.","March 18, 2014","true","3.3"," 24 of 31 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","24","31","0","0"

This game did not disappoint. I was a little bit suprised at the science fiction tone that the game took near the end, but it did not spoil the overrall experience.\n\nI really don't want to spoil the story. Suffice it to say, you begin in 1912, then travel to 2004, 2090 B.C., and finally 2040 A.D. to solve a mystery surrounding the lighthouse on Fetch Rock.\n\nI love the look of this game. My favorite parts of the game is when you are first discovering the lighthouse in 1912. The attention to historical detail is wonderful, and I enjoyed learning about the responsiblities and the characters themselves. It is also, in my opinion the creepiest part of the game. Exploring the lighthouse proves to be a dark and somewhat claustrophobic experience. You hear the ghostly voices of the men who have disappeared. There is great use of ambient sound, slight hints of a musical score, and sound effects. With this game, the scares come with the general creepiness and uneasy feeling of being alone and yet not alone in a lighthouse at night.\n\nThe puzzles can be somewhat tricky. Imagine if Myst were a horror/ghost story. The interface is the same as Myst which may annoy some, since you have to be at the right angle to be able to see/find key objects or solve puzzles. The puzzles will require taking notes, since there is not an in-game journal. Also, you will be reading a lot! It is very apparent what to take note of, especially if you have played Dark Fall 1.\n\nThis game has been said to be weaker than Dark Fall 1. I don't think that is very fair. The location is different and the story has more of a science fiction feel, due to the time travel. However, I do not think that this game should be called worse. It is different, and it is a fun play. I know I will definitely be playing this in the future...it'll be a lot easier since I saved all my notes!\n\n\n","April 3","true","12.6"," 14 of 15 people (93%) found this review helpful","93","14","15","0","2"

It is not visceral, or bloody or graphic, but it definitely sent shivers up my spine (much more so than slasher horror ever does, tho i love both).\nIf you want to enjoy it, and 'get it', play it slowly, explore and take in the atmosphere from one of the masters of atmospheric horror adventures.","October 20, 2014","true","8.0"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

Also no maps, at all! So, unless you have the precious (and very enviable!) gift of an eidetic memory, you have to use the still reliable instruments of pen&paper to help you get to the end of this story!\n\nWarning2: it's a game of SLOW pace! No running from monsters, no fighting! The recurring action you'll do is...READING! A lot! And observing and clicking on everything you see, and.. re-observing and re-clicking, especially when you recover a "special item"!\n\nNow that you are warned but still find yourself intrigued by it, back to the game-review:\nIt's 29th April 1912, you play as Benjamin Parker, a cartographer sent to Trewarthan, Cornwall, to map the area of the harbor town and find yourself involved in the tragic events occured to the Keepers of the Lighthouse..\nThis is the beginning of a story well written and designed: the more you proceed, the more you are gripped by it. A story that branch out through the present, the past and future (from the point of view of whom?..you'll see). One could say that there are many protagonist: Benjamin Parker, the Lighthouse, the Keepers and..the Spooky! All of them has story to tell and you are there to unravel it and..maybe, save them all... in every time...  as I was going up the stair... I met a man who wasn't there...\n\nGameplay: it's a firstperson game and you can't move freely on the screen but have to use the arrows (forward, back, right, left) that show up moving the cursor on the screen; when cursor is shaped like magnifyglass you can zoom in; with curson sa an hand, you can pickup object and click things; when the cursor is shaped like a wrench you have to use some objects from your inventory.\nThe inventory is suited at the bottom of the screen. At the top, on the left, there is the activity bar (save, load, quit).\nSince there isn't an auto-save, to do it you have to click on Save and it will open My Documents folder (or make a new one in a directory you prefer), where you can label and save your progress ( do it often).\nAs I said before, there is no diary to take trace of the clues and evidences you'll find nor a map.\nAlso, every action you do, need to be repeated again and again and again.. example, if you find a locked box and you're able to lock-pick and open it, but then you "exit" from this action, you HAVE TO lock-pick it again! The same thing happens for doors, hidden drawers and so on: you have to repeat those action every time!\nRemeber to click on everything (it's important, you'll see) read everything and sift through everything..you don't know where a clue can be hidden...\n\nPro:\nThe story: intriguing, gripping, original and inspired by the poem "Flannan Isle" of Wilfrid Wilson Gibson, 1912\nThe pluzzes: well designed and clever\nThe acting-voices: soooo Cornish and very well acted (especially the spooky voices). As well as the background musics and enviromental sounds and effects\nThe graphics: the ideas and concepts behind the drawings of the enviroments are very interesting and well designed\nCon:\nThe lack of diary to trace the evidences and clues\nThe absence of a map (especially in some situations can be disorienting)\nThe major hindrance is the obligation to repeat over and over actions already made: like lock-picking doors, drawers and etc. everytime you want to open them\nMy rate for this game is 7/10 (I would have rated it more if there wasn't that problem with the "repeating" actions)\n..here... over here... this way... he's watching you... he's waiting for you.... hi hi hi hi....","January 8","true","7.5"," 11 of 11 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","11","11","0","4"

Although puzzles are quite simple, literally there are no puzzles, but search for clues, this game is still decent. Only one disappointment is the ending, it's a little abstract. And bug with starting/ending movies doesn't add any charm to the game, these movies are just absent. But this game is still worth your time.","February 14, 2014","true","10.0"," 9 of 12 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","9","12","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/eevilauntie/recommended/260710/","eevilauntie","eevil.auntie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/eevilauntie/","189 products in account","In theory this game could have been great. I really liked the different milieus and the genre shifts. There were moments when I was genuinely spooked although I knew there would be no jumpscares and no possibility of dying. The gameplay mechanics were however so frustrating that I can't recommend this game, even though I personally enjoyed it because of the story.\n\nCons:\n- the disorienting and dizzying task of trying to find every possible viewpoint to find the one exact view with an essential item or secret, with the added bonus of some locations (caves, rocks, vents) being impossible to navigate without going in circles FOREVER.\n- accidentally doing a one-way teleport and having to take the long way back\n- accidentally going through the same lengthy conversations with no option to skip them\n- said conversations and ghost soundbites being much too repetitive\n- the ghost hunting elements of the game being sort of... light and decorative, with none of the hands-on feel of the first Dark Fall game\n- getting stuck because of the aforementioned navigational difficulties and not even being able to consult a walkthrough because this is the Director's Cut of the game and some of the puzzles and hidden locations have been changed.\n\n\nThat said, the game isn't impossible to finish with some good guesswork. If you're a fan of this developer's games and tricky point-and-click mysteries, you could give it a go. I kind of wish I'd listened to other reviewers and skipped this one in favour of Dark Fall: Lost Souls, but on the other hand this game does dish out more of Jonathan Boakes's worldbuilding which I do enjoy.","November 13, 2014","false","9.8"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","10","14","0","0"

There's more to the old lighthouse than meets the eye, and there are a couple big surprises. I recommend against any walkthrus, as this game has some twists that could be spoiled easily if you like the thrill of discovery. The puzzles actually make sense in the context of the story or have documents that spell the solutions out, if you can find them. One solution in particular, towards the end of the game, can actually be found quite early on in exploration. Take good notes, and this will be a very rewarding experience!","February 21, 2015","true","9.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

This game suffers from almost all the same faults, except the graphics are of a better resolution.\n\nSome things I hated- No opening sequence. Game just starts.\n- You are allowed to zoom in on stuff, only to find nothing there.\n- No item labels. No descriptions. Nothing.\n- Ugly conversation scene with a man at start of game. You see just the top part of his head, very close-up. Seriously?!\n- Clicking on a journal suddenly brings up a cutscene out of nowhere when you get to a certain page. Then you are made to click on something, and you are whisked back to the journal page. WTF.\n\nDon't bother with this oneIt should be a free Flash game or something.

It felt like I skipped an entire section of the game - my inventory slots were 1/3 full, and I have no idea what I missed. I was able to solve the final puzzle using just the clues I found in the game (IE without using a walkthrough), but the plot itself, in my opinion, was not resolved - which is too bad because the plot was exciting and was just getting exciting when the game abruptly ended.","December 7, 2015","true","4.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
