Like Spelunx, I just can't put my finger on why I'm so intrigued by this game, but there's something that draws me to explore it and interact with everything. Maybe it's the sheer age of the game combined with its sheer uniqueness. Also, the Myst making-of easter egg video is fascinating. This game is well-ported and can probably run on anything, so you have no excuse not to give it a try.","December 7, 2013","true","0.2"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","17","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/recommended/63630/","jonesr","JonesR","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jonesr/","1280 products in account","It should take less than an hour to explore the variety of mystic places in The Manhole alongside interacting with all the different creatures and surroundings. This point-and-click adventure offers no objectives, yet is full of rich detail and interactivity. Several good scores of music and a hidden video of The Making of Myst are also included. Even after 25+ years, The Manhole offers a level of thoroughness that many modern point-and-click adventures lack.","February 21, 2014","true","1.0"," 10 of 10 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","10","10","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TiffanyAK/recommended/63630/","TiffanyAK","TiffanyAK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TiffanyAK/","1800 products in account","Like the other "bonus" games included within the bundle, Manhole isn't the kind of point-and-click adventure that we are pretty much all used to these days. There are no real puzzles, no inventory to worry about, no end game, or anything else. Rather, it's just a matter of exploring and clicking things to see what happens. The graphics and characters are quite cute, and the game is perfect for kids, with lots of fun features. I actually thought it was pretty good even for me, though there is one big issue. The game seems to have a crashing issue, at least on my computer. Not a bad one, by any means. I just didn't care enough to go back into it after it suddenly stopped working and closed. Outside of that, it does soon make you want a bit more from it, as an adult, though it was a nice reminder of nostalgia of days past.","June 24, 2014","true","0.3"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SteamHookups/recommended/63630/","SteamHookups","^7(]^1[)^2~=>WarLord<=~","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SteamHookups/","4903 products in account","There is really no point to the game and no real story. The game is for those that like to explore. Its a simple click here and there game to see what happens when you click on certain things. While on your exploration you will run into unique creatures that will put a smile on your face when you meet them. The game is more geared towards children and how they like to explore. The game is great for any parent wanting to entertain a child for a period of time. I highly recommend getting this game in pack with other games and get it for creativity of this exploration world that you get tossed into. I loved playing it and exploring the many areas of this game.","April 2, 2011","true","5.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"
