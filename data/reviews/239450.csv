The game everyone owns and nobody ever plays. Basically it works like going with a bunch of buddies to the lasergun or paintball arena. Except you stay at home - you are a monkey - you pick up blue things on the floor and attack the enemy spawn point and hope your team wins. But you will not find a team - or ennemies. And when / If you do you will quickly realize that a lot of other games involve team deathmatches and are much more entertaining. And you will then move on and completely forget about this game until someone tries to trade it to you in exchange for something expensive that you own.","January 3, 2015","false","1.2"," 100 of 114 people (88%) found this review helpful 43 people found this review funny","88","100","114","43","3"

Rather than just killing eachother, it's a battle to drop your enemy's energy to 0 while keeping yours above that.  In addition to combat, you can collect energy to deposit into your generator and collecting enough will drop your opponent's energy as well.  All of this takes place in randomly generated levels which unfortunately aren't always balanced, often only spawning energy on one side of the map or placing one player's generator in a very difficult to use location.\n\nUnfortunately the problems don't end there.  For a multiplayer-only game the netcode is terrible with frequent hit detection problems, disappearing energy, and being hit by explosions by entering the area several seconds after it happened.  The platforming is well designed, but is often clumsy in practice due to the random generation.\n\nDespite these problems, the game is quite fun.  It looks great, has great music, and plenty of player customization to work with.  It unfortunately never took off and has very few active players but if you have some friends to play with, it's well worth your time.","April 27, 2014","true","8.5"," 94 of 130 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","94","130","0","3"

Their humorous adventure games "Ben There, Dan That" and "Time Gentlemen Please" were absolutely fantastic. This however... is not.\n\nI had high hopes for this game, I got to try it out early on thanks to the kindness of the developer sharing a key. It looked quite promising. While I'm not much into PvP games myself, it seemed quite enjoyable at least for a while although probably getting very repetitive after some time. But nice at least for a few games possibly with friends, blasting each other's monkey faces off. Pretty simple rules, collect and deposit energy cubes compting for them with the other monkey, shooting each other. Could work. And I thought it would be quite okay when I played the early version, but I expected it to be properly polished and debugged.\n\nBugs... The major problem of this game are bugs. Horrible horrible bugs. IT'S INFESTED WITH BUGS. I took several screenshots to document a few. Those things unfortunately haven't been fixed despite the long time that's passed since the releas. It feels like the whole network engine in this game is completely broken and randomly works or doesn't work, depending on the mood. Sometimes it will connect you with the other player, sometimes it will give you a ludicrous error message saying something went wrong BUT THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT. Sometimes it will just try to connect infinitely and never succeed, sometimes during the attempts to connect the menus will disappear. Sometimes you see nobody in a lobby full of players. Lots and lots of issues too numerous to list merely with the network engine. The game requires to be quit with Alt-F4 at times when it gets stuck trying to establish a connection, expect to restart it a lot.\n\nThese issues take away all enjoyment of the game and make it frustrating.\n\nSMALL UPDATE: I played this game again some time after writing this review and I encountered a lot less problems. I also had a good time thanks to doing really well and having a great winning streak. I don't know if they finally fixed it a bit or something, but honestly: this game can actually be really fun when it works properly.","July 24, 2014","false","17.6"," 44 of 57 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","44","57","0","6"

During the match you have to collect cubes and return them to your base in order to increase your points. You are also equipped with a gun that you can use to kill your opponent, decreasing their points. You start at 200 points that decrease naturally over time and the match stops when one of the players reaches 0 points. There are different power ups that you can use and you also have the ability to drop bombs that explode your opponent. The points that you gain after winning a match can be used out of combat to purchase extra perks (speed boosts, more jumps, higher jumps etc.)\n\nOne good thing about this game is that you have the option of playing local co-op matches; since the official servers are not populated at all (you can usually find maximum 10 people that you can invite to play with, and these spread over the 4 servers while trying to get some Playfire rewards). This is why it’s probably best aquired as a 2-pack, with the intention on playing it with a friend.\n\nI also liked the idea of the Monkey Fever achievement – you get this achievement only by playing against someone that already has it.\n\nOne downside of this game is the controls: jumps that don’t react properly to the keyboard input, and sometimes wall climbing or wall gripping fails. Due to these issues, getting the Cheeky Monkey achievement (which requires you to make a perfectly timed and extremely tight jump) was really frustrating to me (it took me 40 mins – 1h of repetitive jumps to finally get it). The network synchronization is also lacking – sometimes you can see the opponent at low health when they are in fact at almost full health.\n\nGun Monkeys doesn’t offer much content or replay value. It might be fun for a few matches but not more; I would recommend getting it during a sale (if you don’t have it already – who doesn’t even? it’s been in tons of sales / bundles / free promotions).\n\nIf you have a friend willing to go afk during the matches, you can get 100% in around 4h. Otherwise, it will take a lot more time if you decide to play against other people since they won’t let you win that easily and a match might take quite long (more than 5 minutes).\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","March 27, 2015","false","15.3"," 32 of 37 people (86%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","86","32","37","4","3"

The concept seems amazing, the game seemed fun... however its multiplayer is 100% dead and all I could play was the tutorial. Therefore, based on what limited amount of the game I could play, I will tell you the Pros and Cons.\n\nPros:\n♦ Awesome remapable controls (Every game needs remapable controls as easy as Gun Monkeys!)\n♦ Great team colour settings (Pretty much any colour you want, you can be)\n♦ Nice amount of unlockables for winning games (Fair way to unlock perks in the game)\n♦ Sexy voice over and backstory (Love the voice over and well thoughout backstory that suits)\n♦ Nice Steam Trading Cards\n♦ Easy Achievements (If the game wasn't dead)\n♦ Decent Sound and Graphics (From what I witnessed in the Tutorial)\n\nCons:\n♦ Alt+Tab caused game to crash on numerous occasions (This shouldn't happen for any reason)\n♦ Idle changes resolution to something random (This is annoying as it doesn't change it native to your current resolution settings and doesn't change the resolution back upon closing)\n♦ Servers register people into them making them say full or busy when they are empty (This is terrible as it registers a plyer to a server even when the person is offline making a server look active when it's 100% dead)\n♦ Multiplayer is 100% dead (this sucks as it looks like a fun game)\n♦ Price is too high (If the game has no-one playing it, the devs need to look at other ways to make people come back such as making it free)\n♦ Devs seemingly have abandoned the game (Along with the price point, the Devs seemingly arn't doing anything to make people want to come back an play this game which is annoying)\n♦ Hard to get all Achievements as you need to vs people to get them (As the game is dead, so are achievements essentially)\n\nOverall, from the tutorial and farming cards, this seems like it would be a decent PvP 2D Platformer style game. However, even though from what I played the game looked quite fun, due to the servers being 100% dead it is unplayable unless you had a friend in the same region you wanted to vs over and over again... if that isn't the case than there is no point buying this. Although it is 100% dead, it doesn't seem like a bad game it just seems like it has been left for dead and no-one has any incentive to continue playing it which is why on a whole I have given it a thumbs down.\n\nPS: If this game had people playing it, it would be a good game.","October 20, 2015","false","3.3"," 25 of 28 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","25","28","0","0"

A while ago, I bought a humble bundle (not for this game of course) and got a 2-pack for this game. Until today, May 14, 2015, my copy of "Gun Monkeys" has been sitting in my library along with games such as "Rocketbirds" and "Squishy the Suicidal Pig" gathering dust. Me and my pal Trevor decided to play it tonight and we were sorely mistaken.\nFirst of all, the monkey's cry that screams at you immediately after launching game caused our ear-drums to bleed. If you have your volume on normal, you will experience the same pain as the sound is quite shocking. Next, we noticed that there was an over-abundance of underscores and decimal places. Quite unnecessary and annoying.\nWhen trying to play the game, we also noticed that we were indeed the only two people in the entire world that were playing this game. The servers were empty and that is a good thing. This game is as bad as Terin Tharp's french horn solo to the tune of Indiana Jones. (THAT MEANS IT IS REALLY BAD.)\nAfter actually starting the game, the first thing we made fun of is the blood. It is everywhere. It is as if we were ketchup packets. It was so bad that my game started lagging and it covered up the stupid cubes that we need to collect. The combat is awful and repetitive. The only thing that mixes it up is the powerups and most of them are laughable.\nLastly, the respawn time.... it takes about 10 seconds to respawn. Why. Me and Trevor are the only ones in the WORLD playing this game. Did I mention that they cut of your name to be 8 characters? "Dr. Robeatnik" turned into to "Dr. Robe." (I found this hilarious and the best part of the experience.)\nTo sum it all up, this game is boring and you can only laugh at it for about 15 minutes. But, it is as laughable as Donovan Hall trying to pole vault.","May 14, 2015","false","0.2"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","17","21","4","0"

It can actually be really fun, if you have someone to play with...but more on that later.\n\nWhat is this game about?\n\nGun Monkeys is a little, fun 1-v-1 deathmatch platformer with proceduraly generated world. You're in control of a monkey with a gun (duh!). Every match starts with a 200 second countdown for both players. You can increase your time/energy by picking up the little blue power blocks and returning them to your spawn point. This also decreases the time/energy of your opponent. Player who runs out of time, loses.\nWhen you're killed, you respawn after a few seconds, with your countdown still running. In the end, the "gun" part of this game is all about keeping your opponent from the power blocks, cutting his way back to spawn point, and generally creating a hold-up.\nOccasionaly, the game drops a power-up crate, which grants you new ability or weapon for a limited time or with a limited ammo. Also, you can plant bombs with somewhat fast fuse, but you have to be careful when you do so, since they consume part of your energy/time.\n\nThe Good.\nThe game is really easy to jump into, since the core mechanincs are pretty simple (in a good way). For me, it feels rewarding and fun to play, but can also get a bit frustrating (when you're getting obliterated by your girlfriend for instance). Also, the visuals, soundtrack, and overall atmosphere is nice and suits the game wel.\nWhat I really appreciate is the fact you get one more copy of the game as a gift, to give to your friend, so you have someone to play with right away. It has local multiplayer mode too, which is always a nice thing. There are trading cards and a couple of achievements too, so if you're that kind of a person...\n\nThe Bad and the Ugly.\nThe biggest problem of this game is, that the servers are (almost) dead, so that's pretty much the reason why they give you +1 copy. Even when you finally meet someone in the lobby, there's a big chance they will disconnect during the match (been there). Like I said, it's nice they've added local multiplayer too, but when there's no one around, you can't do anything. I think the game could be much more alive, if there was some kind of story mode, or at least enemy Ai. Instead, it's stuck in this infinite spiral of death and no one wants to buy it anymore.\nThe other thing what bugs me are collision models and the confusion they create sometimes. Collision models don't match sprites most of the time, so you'll see monkeys overlapping with walls and such. Because of that, the controls may not feel as responsive as they should.\nThe last thing, although it's not a major problem, is the default controls layout. Thankfully, you can easily rebind those. Also I think gamepad would be great for this game, but i have no way to try that.\n\nConclusion\nObviously, the game has some major problems, but it can be fun if you can accept it for what it is.\nShould you buy it? To be brutally honest, I got it for free and I wouldn't pay 5 bucks for this, unless there were more people playing it or a single player mode. This game was on sales and giveaways more times I can count, so it would be foolish to pay a full price for it.\nI recommend you to wait for giveaways or sales, and get it if you have anyone to play with, either online or offline. If you have a spare key, give it to a friend, like I did. You might end up having a blast.\n\nIf you don't have friends, don't bother.","November 24, 2014","true","6.7"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","15","21","3","0"

These are the first words the game expresses whilst walking through its tutorial. Of course, while there is no story version of the game and only constant battle between yourself and a friend, Gun Monkeys is probably one of the best casual fighting games I've ever played. I've always been one for the little platformers, but Size Five's Gun Monkeys has a great design with very smooth and excellent original artwork, an impressively solid soundtrack, and a serious generosity of violence that can be tried and tested again and again with its fun mechanics and multitude of weapons and perks. Gun Monkeys is actually anything but confusing. It's an excellent title to get with a group of friends and blast each other to the other side of the blue-cube filled universe. Gun Monkeys is riot and it doesn't pretend to be anything else. It's an absolute blast!","June 24, 2014","true","25.4"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","16","25","0","0"

During battle, the backdrop is always very bloomy and fun to look at. The music is very good and keeps you pumped during gameplay. Narration is provided during the tutorials and is very, very well done.\n\nControls are easy to pick up and the tutorial is extremely helpful for understanding how the game works. Learning curve is minimal to moderate - one of the hardest things will be deciding which perks to buy first (depends on your playstyle).\n\nPre-battle, you can select a lobby and chat with other uses. To challenge someone to a duel, you simply click ont their name - hovering over their name provides statistics like number of games played, win percentage, and equipped perks (up to 4 at a time).\n\nDuring a battle, you are tasked with lowering the opponent's battery cell to 0. You can do this by picking up energy squares that will randomly spawn on the map (you can hold up to 3 at a time) and returning this to your base. This will boost your battery's health while also damaging your opponent's. Furthermore, you can also kill your opponent to reduce their battery by 35 points. The respawn time is not to long, however, there is a delay before your character can move after you spawn.\n\nYou can use proximity mines and your weapon to try to kill your opponent, as well as the random item pickups. They can either be weapon or power boosts (perks can help increase the rate of either item boost). The variation between weapons and power boosts is decent, and obtaining either can give you a serious edge over your opoonent (ex: a heavy rifle that does considerably more damage). Weapon drops have a certain number of ammunitation before you revert back to your original gun.\n\nThe levels are randomly generated and usually littered with ladders and floating platforms. As a monkey, you can wall jump indefinitely so long as you keep doing it (and have a wall).\n\nA fun 1v1 game if you are interested in this playstyle. Will definitely keep you occupied for a good deal of time.\n\nRecommend.","July 24, 2014","true","1.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

I guess it's time to write my review since I cannot find any matches anymore and it is useless to keep the game on my computer anymore.\n\nFirst the good things:\n\nTutorial:Short, straight to the point, funny voice actor. Great tutorail !\n\nUnlockables:A huge variety of them. They suit every playstyle. Grinding for the higher perks is not required and the default ones work fine as well. In other words: everyone is equal and the perks don't make someone more overpowered than the other.\n\nLevel design:Great level design. The randomness of choosing a map is a good idea. You never know what map you are gonna get and when you see a map you haven't seen in a while, you say: aaaah this one, cool. Some are underwater, some have 0 gravity, others provide you with jetpacks. Big variety there.\n\nControls:There's only a few buttons you need to play this game. A controller works perfectly fine too. The only downside is that you cannot control the game menu or accept challenges from other players with the controller. That eliminates couch gaming because you always have to have your mouse next to you.\n\nMechanics:Pick up cubes, bring them back to base, set traps so opponent can't pick up cubes or just shoot at him and kill him. What is not to love there ? The random falling crates also make the matches a lot more fun. The cryo power-up is garbage though. Making you freeze and letting your opponent gear up and collect many cubes while you cannot even move.\n\nAnd now for the bad things:\n\nGhost town:I've had this game for 2(?) months and was able to squeeze only 12.7 hours from it. NOBODY plays this game. Don't be fooled by the  12.7 hours though. Half of them were waiting for players to join a server, and I am not ever over exaggerating. Probably even more time was spend only waiting. Oh and I don't mean that there's noone at a certain time of the day. I've tried every hour of the day. It's always a ghost town.\n\nNo punishment:There are some players who will play with you for a minute or two and just when you are about to win they will quit the game, giving you 0 XP points and having your time wasted. Great, time to wait another 20 minutes to find a player in the lobby.\n\nIntimidation:Sometimes, very rarely you can find someone on a server, the problem is that nobody wants to play against someone who's played more than 100 games. I've played 244 games and after my 100-150 one it was incredibly difficult convincing anyone to play with me because they feel that I will crush them just because of my big number of games played.\n\nIn conclusion:\nAn incredibly fun game and one of the 3 games I have ever enjoyed the multiplayer of. I am a singleplayer guy and never liked multiplayer, but this game grabbed me and I though that I would play it forever and ever, however NOBODY ELSE PLAYS IT. My suggestion is to buy it ONLY if you are willing to wait in the server lobby for hours every day and eventually finding someone who is not just farming cards or is not intimidated by your playtime.\n\nSince there is no middle ground, I will give it a thumbs up, purchase at your own risk. You might end up not even being able to play it.","January 29, 2015","true","12.7"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Honestly in this review this is my 7th copy (Btw I have none left, the keys last like 5 seconds and are useless)\n\nPlus in key features they say "Loads of Achievements and Trading Cards to collect!"\n\n8 Achievements isn't a lot and trading cards are possibly the only reason to get this game, but even then  other games like Awesomenauts has trading cards, and that's one of the most fun games I played in a long time, worth my money and I usually play it all the time.\n\nSkip it, this game is a waste of time, I do admire the other work the creators have put out and I appreciate them trying to create a 1v1 deathmatch game, but even then TF2 has had this for years, and that's F2P\n\nAgain, skip this and play TF2 or Awesomenauts.\n\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/204300/\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/440/","December 19, 2014","false","0.1"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","2"

You need to collect blue cubes in order to bring your opponent energy to zero and win but you need to press down to collect those blue cubes and the "too hard to master" controls gives you the impression that you are walking on ice all the time. You will have to reset your keys because having to press "e" to fire your gun while moving around with "wasd" keys feels counterintuitive... why they selected those as default key bind beats me.\n\nThe music is repetitive and the level design feel bland...  I didn't know procedurally–generated was an excuse to not add strategy to the game. I kind of dig the character design but the fact that you can only shoot left or right and not aim your gun properly bugs me. The visuals are too minimalistic for this sort of game... it compliments the game about as well as a picasso in the middle of some amusement park.\n\nThe weapons are probably the strongest point in this game since killing your opponent seems to be the only enjoyable thing to do but this being said the bombs and mines are overpowered to the point of absurdness because most of the time you will end up blowing yourself up.\n\nAfter each game you earn or lose money and there is a shop in the "my team" section where you can purchase some upgrade and become a little bit more of a treath to others. The items you own can be unequipped but once you remove them they are discarted and I don't even understand how thos items work and no information is given as to how they affect the game. Shady to say the least.\n\nAlso, most of the time your opponents will simply disconect when they are about to lose. No punitive system is present to prevent players from doing so and if a player disconect that match is simply voided.\n\nTo me it feels like Gun Monkey was poorly designed in order to keep people from becoming good at it but some poor souls are trapped in this game and are still trying hard to become better at it every day.\n\nI give Gun Monkey 4/10","October 2, 2014","false","11.2"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The premise is really simple - you are a monkey with a gun, locked in a small arena with another player, who (let's all act surprised now)... is also a monkey with a gun! Your goal is to collect "power cubes" that randomly drop into the level and deposit them into your home base. The catch is that the power level in both player's home bases is always going down, so you have to survive long enough and collect enough power (while simultaneously avoiding the attacks of the other monkey) so that the other player runs out of power before you do. It's about as simple as can be. And that's the problem. While the game has the potential to be fun, there's just not all that much to it. There are a few different weapons that spice things up, and the levels are procedurally generated (so the arena is slightly different every time), but essentially it's just the same thing over and over again. While novel in short bursts (especially if you have a friend to play with), the whole experience can get boring pretty quickly. There are also quite a few bugs I came across in my short time playing (though the developers are actively working on fixing things, so that's nice). The problem for me is that there just isn't enough meat on the bones here to justify a $10 price tag. For half that amount, I'd say go ahead and take a chance... but for full price, you're probably better off passing on it, at least for now.","July 9, 2013","true","1.2"," 9 of 15 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","9","15","0","0"

Apparently the goal is not to kill the other monkey, but instead to awkwardly pick up little energy cubes and get back to your base before the other monkey.  Killing the other monkey only takes a small number of points from them, but if I drop a bomb or if the other monkey gets cubes before me, then I lose a ton of points.  At one point, you'll be pretty even at say 150 points each, then something inexplicable happens and one player suddenly has 450 and the other has 30.  I wonder why there are only 4-5 people in the lobbies, if you are lucky.  And there is no computer to play against to hopefully figure the game out.

The graphics are neato and it works well with a gamepad.\n\nAnd it's cheap. I bought it for about 2 dollars after a free-weekend, and it came with a 2nd copy as a Gift in a fair attempt to hoist the playerbase. Now that it is 75% off, if you sell the trading cards it'd end up costing you ~25 cents.\n\nThe reason i can't recommend it is that there is no playerbase. I've never seen anyone on their servers after the free-weekend last september - not even in 75% off times like now. There is a message in the lobby suggesting you to join the Gun Monkeys Steam Group and check the chatroom to find players. I did that and never found anyone in there either.\n\nMaybe it isn't the developer's fault - for as long as i could play it the game was fine, but unless you fancy playing the tutorial over and over, Gun Monkeys is rendered unusable by this desolation problem.\n\nThen again, maybe it is their fault for releasing a multiplayer-only casual indie game in times when there is such an overabundance of other options. Even the low price doesn't hold much significance if you consider the amount and quality of free-to-play games out there.","January 1, 2014","false","4.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game is small and cheap so it is a good placeholder if you run out of things to do or maybe as a cheap indie game to distribute among friends so you all have a game to play together. I think you should at least look into Gun Monkeys because its not a bad game at all.\n\nNOTE: as stated above the game is small and simple and there are not very many people playing (very few).

It supports a gamepad but is not a gamepad friendly game. If you have one plugged in it will rumble when you are using mouse and keyboard every time an opponent dies, when you do use the gamepad it will sometime become unresponsive when you launch the game with the gamepad still plugged in.\n\nThe chromatic aberration effect mixed with the low field of view causes me such intense eye strain that I can't play for long periods of time. This is the only game I've played that abuses this effect to such levels, even worse than the bloom shader effect fad plaguing every game made during the 2000s.\n\nThe controls are horrible and floaty.

It might be dressed up all fresh and modern with a stylish, charming coat on, but it’s definitely rooted in retro sensibilities. The gleeful cartoon violence and wanton bloodshed combined with an almost perfect distillation of old-school multiplayer gaming make it an absolute joy to play. BUUUUTTTT, nowadays it seems difficult to find opponents.\n\nGame: 6.5/10\nGraphic: 7.5/10\n\n100% Achievement : Easy | Medium | Hard | Very Hard","November 29, 2014","true","3.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

(literally)\n\nIn my opinion the creator of Ben There, Dan That! and Time Gentlemen, Please!, Dan Marshall and Size Five Games create another hilarious fun game on the basis of gun toting, time traveling, colorful monkeys sent to the future to collect the energy source of deceased humans to sent to present day, so that we may power up our toasters, tvs, and thats right our computers to play this game!.\n\nAs a business, your soul goal is to continue to provide the present day human race with enough energy and resources to keep the race moving towards a path to destruction . Your business plan is as follows:  Step 1: create an army of monkeys with powerful rifles to send to the future to keep control of the energy industry. Step 2: something something something, last monkey standing, something. Step 3: PROFIT!!!!\n\nThis is a fun game that is quick and easy to figure out. With short battles between your friends/enemies/friendemies, you can duke it out in space, under the sea, in the alpines, and death (saw) valley. To become victor supreme.\n\nI highly recommend this game. And wish to see more people enjoy it as I have.\n\n-Punasaurus\n","July 6, 2013","true","63.7"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Finding challengers now can be quite difficult.\n\nThe developer is well aware of this, to the point where he gave away lots of copies, and made it so that everyone who purchases the game gets a second copy to gift to a friend, in a commendable effort to repopulate the online lobbies.\n\nHowever, one can't help but point out the fact that this game could have had bots to play against, or maybe even a single-player platforming/sidescrolling story mode. The mechanics are there, but I'm assuming there simply weren't enough resources to include these modes.\n\nFortunately, there is local multiplayer.\n\nAnd don't get me wrong, the game itself is a lot of fun. The art style and soundtrack are really nice.\n\nI do feel that matches can be way too short sometimes, depending on the discrepancy of skill between players – which can prove intimidating to newcomers and contribute to the low-population problem.\n\nBut if you have friends to play against, I highly recommend Gun Monkeys.","January 21, 2014","true","1.6"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

One of which, winning a BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) award. An incredible feat some might say!\n\nGun Monkeys. Well…, I can honestly say I never thought I was going to see those two words in the same sentence. At first glance, I’d thought a game like this was a little absurd, 2 monkeys fighting in an arena, with guns. Nevertheless, the lovely team at “SIZE FIVE Games” sent me a couple of copies to hand around and spread the word (Thanks by the way!).\n\nGun Monkeys is an intense, 2D side-scrolling, platform, and shooter. Gun Monkeys is basically a bunch of bad ♥♥♥ monkeys, competing against each other in a 1-on-1 battlefield. Each player has one core, the objective is to maintain your core for as long as you can by returning little power cubes to your core, or (preferred option), annihilating your foes in the arena with an assortment of weapons! If you forget to maintain your core and the power runs out, then your opposition becomes the winner and will proudly shoot your little monkey brains out anytime, vice versa.\n\nMy personal experience playing the game was quite pleasant besides the fact that I got absolutely demolished in every round I played. The controls were confusing at first but after a couple of rounds, you get used to it. Graphics wise, the game itself is quite… “trippy”, as it features a lot of glowing colours and blurring, but this can be toned down in the options if you wish.   So, besides the oddly scaled matchmaking, I did enjoy jumping around the randomly generated arena’s, collecting different weapon crates and experimenting with the cool perks that the game allows you to purchase for your character.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a couple of fast-paced, 1 on 1, combat/shooter, arena matches with their friends. If you are going to buy this game, might I recommend buying a second copy for a mate just in case, as the servers are not always filled with people to play against. If you can’t find anyone online, the game also supports 2 players on the one keyboard for some local gaming. On a side note, the narrating of this game is hilarious!\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading my insight on Gun Monkeys, I had a blast playing it!\n\nRegards, Paul\n","March 9, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Quite possibly both.\n\nThis game is an arena deathmatch game played by precisely zero (0) people. EU and Asia servers (mentioned by some of the other recommendations) are either permanently offline or never existed in the first place, and all four US servers show a grand total of one person online (me), which means either the matchmaking servers are borked or - Occam's Razor - I am the only person even browsing the lobbies at 2:15pm East Coast US time.\n\nThe matchmaking lobbies have random statistic spam that suggests that even in its peak, very few people actually played this game - most of the "perks" are held by about 75-150 people.\n\nThe "offline local play mode" touted in the "Key Features" is actually player-vs-player - there are no AI bots.\n\nSo the entire gameplay experience here consists of playing through the tutorial, then maybe generating a couple maps to play against a motionless opponent.\n\nWhat's funny is that - from what I can gather by generating some offline maps - the actual gameplay itself isn't even very fun. The monkeys move like they're swimming in syrup and the jumping control is pretty floaty, which makes wall jumping an exercise in tedious frustration. Your monkey can only shoot straight ahead, so between that and the slow, floaty play control there isn't really much room for skill; just spam shots everywhere and hope the other idiot falls into more sawblades than you do.\n\nThe procedural maps are cool in theory, but there's no forced symmetry, which means that it's quite possible that one player's base (gameplay, at its core, consists of grabbing tokens and bringing them back to your base) will require a tricky series of jumps to get to while the other base is in a flat, open area. The fact that the designers didn't think to force symmetry onto the map creation algorithm completely boggles the mind. Pretty sure even the old RandROTT and SLIGE procedural-map-generation engines for Rise of the Triad and DOOM (respectively) had an option to generate mirrored levels for deathmatch.\n\nFinally, "Loads of Achievements and Trading Cards to collect!" is especially hilarious. Eight achievements and six trading cards. There's a fine line between "being enticing" and "flat-out lying", and this certainly straddles that line.\n\nSo in short, this game is positively, categorically worthless if you're hoping for a ladder experience, and even if you and whichever friend you give your extra copy to end up getting past the poorly-designed mechanics, there's - at best - thirty minutes to an hour of fun to be had here before you both get sick of it.\n\nVirtually any game is fun if you're playing it with a buddy, so "sorta fun for a bit if you're playing it with a buddy" isn't really much to go on, and this particular game is so simplistic that unless you and your buddy are lobotomy patients it's doubtful you'll have as much fun - or have fun for as long - with it as you'd have with nearly any other multiplayer game on Steam.","January 9, 2014","false","0.9"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

One of which, winning a BAFTA (British Academy of Film and Television Arts) award. An incredible feat some might say!\n\nGun Monkeys. Well…, I can honestly say I never thought I was going to see those two words in the same sentence. At first glance, I’d thought a game like this was a little absurd, 2 monkeys fighting in an arena, with guns. Nevertheless, the lovely team at “SIZE FIVE Games” sent me a couple of copies to hand around and spread the word (Thanks by the way!).\n\nGun Monkeys is an intense, 2D side-scrolling, platform, and shooter. Gun Monkeys is basically a bunch of bad ♥♥♥ monkeys, competing against each other in a 1-on-1 battlefield. Each player has one core, the objective is to maintain your core for as long as you can by returning little power cubes to your core, or (preferred option), annihilating your foes in the arena with an assortment of weapons! If you forget to maintain your core and the power runs out, then your opposition becomes the winner and will proudly shoot your little monkey brains out anytime, vice versa.\n\nMy personal experience playing the game was quite pleasant besides the fact that I got absolutely demolished in every round I played. The controls were confusing at first but after a couple of rounds, you get used to it. Graphics wise, the game itself is quite… “trippy”, as it features a lot of glowing colours and blurring, but this can be toned down in the options if you wish.   So, besides the oddly scaled matchmaking, I did enjoy jumping around the randomly generated arena’s, collecting different weapon crates and experimenting with the cool perks that the game allows you to purchase for your character.\n\nOverall, I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys a couple of fast-paced, 1 on 1, combat/shooter, arena matches with their friends. If you are going to buy this game, might I recommend buying a second copy for a mate just in case, as the servers are not always filled with people to play against. If you can’t find anyone online, the game also supports 2 players on the one keyboard for some local gaming. On a side note, the narrating of this game is hilarious!\n\nI hope you enjoyed reading my insight on Gun Monkeys, I had a blast playing it!\n\nRegards, Paul\n","March 9, 2014","true","1.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/recommended/239450/","zorder","Zorder","http://steamcommunity.com/id/zorder/","2002 products in account","Great 1vs1 game. It combines platforming with side scrolling shooting in a great way, by adding random power ups that spawn on each level that grant you different powers or weapons since a nuke to a laser sniper rifle, to freezing your oponent to slowing down time. The game excels at this by adding the main mechanic of the game which will grant you victory or defeat. Basicly the goal of the game is to bring your oponent score to 0. You can do that by either killing him or picking up energy cubes, you can carry 3 at each time and the more you bring to your base the more score you gain and the more score your oponent looses. It's such a GREAT game with an AMAZING soundtrack. The only problem is that not enough people play it, so if you like what you see on the trailers or you're just looking for some game to play with your friends in online or local matches grab yourself Gun Monkeys on the Steam Store which comes with 2 copies, one for you, one for a friend or to giveaway/trade, whatever you want.

I mapped the controls to a wired Xbox controller in the settings, so I can't speak for using the keyboard, but with a controller it's responsive. The visuals and art style, soundtrack, and narration are all fantastic. Unfortunately, the major downside I noticed was that the servers seemed fairly barren. This could have just been the 4 servers it pulled for me, or the time of day, but it's a shame because the game is actually a lot of fun. I recommend it, but I can't vouche that you'll have many people to play against unless you have a friend that also owns the game.","August 6, 2014","true","1.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Two players fight against each others to kill the opponent in a limited arena. You collect energy and return it to your base while simultaneously shooting the opponent and deny him progress. Quite fun personally.\n\nAfter a match, assuming you win, you'll earn money. You can use the money to buy perks, equip it and return to another match. Perk system is also simple and intuitive.\n\nThere's a broken system though. If you quit while losing before the match ends, there's no penalty, Frustrating. I personally am not going to buy this game until the issue is addressed.\n\nThe other problem is dead community. Were it not for free weekend, it's been said that servers were continually empty to the point that the Developer are flinging free key here and there.\n\nAs it stands, I'd give this game 7.5/10.

The art style is nice and the soundtrack is really good, the gameplay is fairly solid also. But the bombs literally do a different thing everytime you use them, sometimes the epicenter does no damage whatsoever, or do no damage etc. I had quite a few connection problems and I'm not the only one who's had them. The controls can be wonky at times and some maps are almost unplayable. I think that if 4-player combat was added the game could be more enjoyable.

In Gun monkeys you customize youre team monkey and then you battle one on one where you try to destroy each others main cube. So how is this game ? Overall i would love to give this game a positive review but i just cant because of one huge reason. The game is dead. No ever plays it and you cant find any matches not all of the time anyways. If you will want to play this game you will have to find friens in real life that play it. The game overall is pretty fun. Platforming is fluint and its really fun to do so but there are  a few problems that haunt this game. First one some minor bugs were you cant glitch through walls and some mediocre graphics. Overall this would be a good game and it would get a positve review if it wasnt dead. Right now dont waste youre money on it because you cant find games. Only play if you have friends that play it. I give Gun Monkeys a 5/10","July 7, 2014","false","1.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I then spent maybe an hour in the lobby, looking for an opponent, and never found one, so I can't actually comment on how good the gameplay is.  Whatever its other merits and flaws, this is a indie game with no single-player mode and a small fanbase, so it suffers from the predictable problem of empty lobbies.  Having gotten it for free, I can't really complain, but neither can I recommend it.\n\n(Disclaimer: This was written a few months after playing.

When i got the hang of it, the enemy started receiving all kinds of uber powerups nukes,scatterguns,snipers and whatnot. This game looks like it has been made by 1 person on a laptop. I truly hope this game has been made with 1 laptop... Even though i received this game through GMG welcome pack, I actually regret signing into GMG to receive this pack... not worth the 2 days it took for me to receive my codes and all those fun little links you have to click in order to get your account into working condition.\nIn a nutshell.

Gameplay is just awfull. Lets talk about the matches itself. Match started as a regular DM should start, random shooting while trying to figure the controls (wich are bad). When i got the hang of it, the enemy started receiving all kinds of uber powerups nukes,scatterguns,snipers and whatnot. This game looks like it has been made by 1 person on a laptop. I truly hope this game has been made with 1 laptop... Even though i received this game through GMG welcome pack, I actually regret signing into GMG to receive this pack... not worth the 2 days it took for me to receive my codes and all those fun little links you have to click in order to get your account into working condition.\nIn a nutshell. DO NOT GET THIS GAME ! If someone tries to give you this game, just throw it back and break hes mouse.","October 2, 2014","false","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Soon after release, the developers began several campaigns to give extra copies of the game for free, and just recently, they gave away a nearly unlimited amount to anyone through PC Gamer. It didn't work. No one plays Gun Monkeys.\n\nThe game is simple. You control a monkey, gather energy cubes, use power-ups, and kill the opponent's monkey. As you earn money after each win, you will be allowed to buy unlockable perks and select them for your matches. These perks and power-ups are only OK, and nothing out of the ordinary. Some of them are much more valuable than others, but there is still nothing very fun or interesting about them. You may also customize the color of your monkey, which ensures that you will rarely meet an opponent whose monkey has identical colors. Each level is procedurally generated and filled with platforms and ladders. Some levels have Earth-like gravity, while other levels are in space or underwater. There is only one game mode available, and it's one versus one. If you can find someone to play against that is of the same skill level and with a good ping, there are some short bursts of fun to be had.\n\nThe biggest problem with Gun Monkeys is the lack of players. All the free copies given away to the masses only served to be Steam trading card farms. It's obvious that most people run the game with the only goal being to idle for cards. They don't even join the lobby. If you are lucky enough to find someone in the lobby, you better hope they're actually from the same part of the world as the server you're on. If someone joins a server that is not from their region, they ruin the game for everyone, as lag will prevent the game's objectives from actually being attainable. You won't be able to pick up energy cubes at all, for example. The deadly combination of a non-existent playerbase and terrible netcode ensured that Gun Monkeys was a complete failure.\n\nGun Monkeys is mediocre.","August 20, 2014","false","7.0"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Then you and I are on the same page, but Gears of War isn't available on PC yet and I need to get ♥♥♥♥♥ by Windows and get their new OS when it finally becomes available for us. So upon returning to my house and realizing that I had been robbed of all of my possessions and my imaginary girlfriend had been brutally beaten, my first instinct was to go to my neighbor's house and ask them to play Gun Monkeys with me. Needless to say my neighbors and I no longer have friendly exchanges, because they cannot see the true beauty of Gun Monkeys that I can. The close to empty servers help me deal with my raging claustrophobia, the limited colors help prevent my serious seizures given by my epilepsy, and the gameplay is like slamming a door intentionally on all of my fingers: it helps me numb the true pain of me being a woman on the inside. This game will make you rethink everything, especially the $11 you may have spent on this masterpiece. Might I also say if you have a friend who asks to play Gun Monkeys with you, you probably should stop being their friend. 2/10 Awesome Butt.","June 27, 2015","true","1.8"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","33","2","6","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Loganesquire/recommended/239450/","Loganesquire","*Logan*","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Loganesquire/","59 products in account","Gun Monkeys is a fast paced 2D platformer where you control a monkey with a big gun and mines in a multiplayer only battle which can last less than thirty seconds.\nThis game is two player online ONLY, though there is an offline tutorial available.\nThere are twelve servers to play on, four in USA, four in Europe, and four in Asia, and from my experiences online, I've found their to be a lot of players on all servers at all times of the day, so I have to disagree with any reviews that claim there is a lack of players. The community may of increased since previous reviews.\nYou will be dropped into a random map each match, and your goal is to collect blue squares called "Power Cubes" and take them to your base. This will add power to your base, and the goal here is to keep adding power to your base while killing your opponent preventing him from collecting power for his own base. Cubes and random crates will drop throughout the map and you will awkwardly be picking them up by pressing down repeatedly over top of them. It's unusual. You can carry three cubes at a time, and it's best to cash in at your base with this amount for best results. You can find various items such as a no arms attack against your opponent or item which freezes him in place. You will also find some guns with limited ammunition such as a Sniper rifle and the very powerful and dangerous big nuke.\nWhen you win matches you will earn cash based on how much power you have in your base. This cash can be used to purchase perks which enhance up to four different aspects of the game for you, such as starting power in your base increased, enhanced weapons, enhanced jumping etc. These perks will give you a big advantage over your opponent.\n\nThe game can be horribly unbalanced, not very fun, and can be very frustrating for newcomers. The gameplay gets stale and the random maps are really bad sometimes, as random tends to be.The advantages you get from perks make it nearly impossible for new players to compete with the experienced. Players can quit matches, resulting in any impressive plays you may of done in the map being worthless, since the only penalty for quitting a match is a loss of $500 from the quitters in game bank account. In other words, if your doing really well, your opponent can simply pull the plug on that by quitting.\nI've found a lot of people are just sitting in servers for the card drops so there is that.\n\nHowever, I personally recommend this game.\n\nIt's usually cheap or free and it grows on you.","December 13, 2014","true","25.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/recommended/239450/","Spartan717","Echo419","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Spartan717/","507 products in account","Meh.\n\nYou know games which are just 'Dead'? Well this is one of them. Gameplay reveolves around controling a monkey (with a gun) and collecting energy cubes which you need to store at your container. The catch is that you'll have to compete against other monkeys for the cubes. The container's energy drains slowly sso you need to collect more cubes before it runs out and you lose. You have your basic gun available and a nuke to defeat other monkeys. When you die you will respawn.\n\nAs mentioned previously, this game is dead. You will struggle to find any servers with players in them. If this game had any 'single player' content this wouldn't be a problem, however this game has NONE whatsoever. There is support for local co-op on the same PC however.\n\nThe storyline (from the tutorial) is that humanity created a device to create a new energy source. The device malfunctions and causes servere damage to the planet. However it does create energy via cubes. Humans now rely on energy sources from cubes (which contain the energy of dead) to run their everyday appliances. In order to collect the cubes, organisations send armed monkeys to collect them so they can sell them to the public.\n\nThe graphics aren't that great, just plain 2D animations. Further more the sound effects isn't rememberable either. The narrator from 'Thomas was alone" plays a part in telling the story in the tutorial, which was somewhat humurous but not enough throughout gameplay.\n\n\nUnless you want to collect cards, I highly recommend you skip this game.","February 2, 2015","false","1.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game focuses on you taking charge of a modern-day power company. In the distant future, a catastrophic experiment into Perpetual Energy obliterates all human life, and you are the head of this company and you send monkeys to grab power cores but other monkeys are there to steal them as well!\n\nIt is quite a creative game, confusing at first, but the tutorial is a great way for you to start playing the game, the story is great and the actor who voices as the narrator while playing the tutorial and a game will help you on the way as well as keeping you entertained while playing\n\nThe only thing I found a bit awkward was the controls and how un-responsive they are sometimes and that the level designs are not so great, and till what I have played so far, the only mode of play you can play is just a monkey vs. another monkey, maybe I might be wrong, but I wish the developers could add more modes, like team vs. team, and other modes to enjoy this game\n\nBut overall it is a fun game to play when you are bored or feel like playing something different!\n\nRECOMMENDED :)  Best played with a controller","July 18, 2014","true","2.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

By collecting power cubes, you put your power up and decrease the enemy monkey's power by a slight amount.\nHowever; by collecting three, you deal a significant amount of damage to the enemy's power core.\nFighting in the game is quick and tactful, whether it's trying to drop a bomb so it only kills your enemy or gunning from behind cover, the kill will always decrease the enemy's power and cause them to spend time respawning.\n\nOverall, I give it an 8/10\n- Good fun\n- Funny narrator\n- Easy to get the hang of\n- Multiple battlefields with different effects in each\n\nx Not much long term replayability\nx Don't expect a sequel, or a decent one\nx Some players are known to disconnect whilst the match is preparing, leaving you connecting with no timeout whilst giving them a win and you a loss as you are forced to quit.","October 12, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I've seen anywhere from ZERO players online to upwards of a whole whopping TEN. seriously. The only 2 problems I with this game is (1)  a severe lack of a user base. Which considering it NEEDS people to play against as it is lacking a Single Player mode, this is unforgivable. (2) the community that is there is lame-o and they disconnect when you start to beat them and they receive no punishment for doing so and the match is considered null and void meaning you gain no money since for winning to buy the upgrades available, but they do this because when you lose, you lose money. I'm assuming these 2 problems are connected. once this happens to you multiple times in a row, you realize why there are no people playing it.\n\nIf you have a friend that will play this with you then i think you guys can and will have a crapton o' fun; However if you're friendless, or your friends are losers who don't play REAL games, like the degenerates whom I have the distinct displeasure to call my friends that only play console (bleh!) or only the newest most expensive games around for about month until its onto the next $60+ game; but I digress.\n\n\n\nTLDR: TLDR: TLDR: TLDR: TLDR: TLDR: TLDR: TLDR: TLDR: TLDR: TLDR: TLDR: TLDR: TLDR:\nReally fun casual time killer with absolutely no player base. comes with extra key, so bring your own friend to murdolate because the player base is nonexistent except people who disconnect when losing to avoid losing money which also prevents you from gaining money for winning","October 29, 2014","false","0.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/recommended/239450/","slycooperfan1","SlyCooperFan1","http://steamcommunity.com/id/slycooperfan1/","307 products in account","Gun Monkeys is a deathmatch-ish game where you take control of a monkey and blow up the other monkey in various ways as many times as possible. It has a collection mechanic, where you must pick up power cores and bring them back to your "base" to increase its health. Each base loses health steadily, as well as when their monkey is killed, and you have to win by not losing your base's health first. It seems like a really fun idea, but it falls flat on its monkey face. I received it for free during a giveaway some time ago, and I'm glad I didn't pay for it.\n\nGameplay: Climb ladder, pick up, move left, move right, shoot, drop bomb. That's basically all Gun Monkeys has to offer in terms of controls. Movement is floatier than any game I've ever played, and jumping is horrific to control especially when performing a wall jump ("wall grab" as they call it). Shooting is interesting, however, and there are some really cool weapons.\n\nStory: Non-existent. This is a multiplayer-based game.\n\nMusic/Sound Design: I didn't mind it at first, but the music started to get really annoying and I ended up turning it off in favor of my computer's music library. Sound design is hit-or-miss - the jumping sounds are really awkward, but the shooting effects are well done.\n\nGraphics: Without a doubt, this is the worst part of the game. The camera following the monkey around is much slower than the monkey himself, and the graphics seem extremely old - in a bad way. Too many lighting effects or dimming effects with no proper balance, and bland effects for shooting or jumping around. Not even the power cubes or bases are particularly interesting to look at. If it was possible to play Gun Monkeys without looking at it, I'd much rather do that.\n\nSummary: If I haven't put you off of Gun Monkeys yet, I'd like to warn anyone reading that the multiplayer is dead. Thankfully, this game does come with local co-op support, and for that it definitely deserves some points. It is also the first game I've ever seen that gives you two copies instead of one when you buy it, allowing you to play with a friend if they're interested as well. It may be far more enjoyable with a friend, but with unoptimized movement and terrible graphics, this is not a game I want to keep playing in the future unless I want to get its achievements for my library.","November 18, 2014","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The thing they should have added is a singleplayer campaign, to expand the game a bit more. Also, I didn't really find the game  a whole lot interesting because it doesn't have any game-changing mechanics.

By collecting power cubes, you put your power up and decrease the enemy monkey's power by a slight amount.\nHowever; by collecting three, you deal a significant amount of damage to the enemy's power core.\nFighting in the game is quick and tactful, whether it's trying to drop a bomb so it only kills your enemy or gunning from behind cover, the kill will always decrease the enemy's power and cause them to spend time respawning.\n\nOverall, I give it an 8/10\n- Good fun\n- Funny narrator\n- Easy to get the hang of\n- Multiple battlefields with different effects in each\n\nx Not much long term replayability\nx Don't expect a sequel, or a decent one\nx Some players are known to disconnect whilst the match is preparing, leaving you connecting with no timeout whilst giving them a win and you a loss as you are forced to quit.","October 12, 2014","true","6.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However this is strictly 1 vs 1 multiplayer online.  No single player, which is extremely sad because again the narration and story would have been so exciting to play.   I wish I read the comments sooner as well to know this, so buying this with that idea was indeed my fault.  But the comments are correct, nobody was playing the game, so it was 1 vs 0.  Even if you select other regions like US, UK, or Asia.  Nobody was playing it.  Therefore the game is not worth 6 bucks at all, even with the extra copy.  I'm sorry but I can't recommend it unless they add Single player features since multiplayer is useless.  Hopefully the narrator Kevin Eldon will find a more fulfilling game to narrate next time.","May 13, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Good thing there was a free key for it. This game isn't really worth buying though. Spend your money on something else.

That'll make money. EVERYONE LOVES MONKEYS, RIGHT?" Well, you done goofed. The game is average, has low traffic and a ♥♥♥♥ online play system, and the concept is stupid.

It is an online multiplayer game that I have never been able to play because no one is ever online playing this game. I did however manage to get a little taste of it during the game's tutorial. It looked cool and played nice. But, again, no one to play with. And there does not seem to be a single player mode. The closest thing I've gotten to actualy gameplay is doing the local 2 player match...by myself...against player 2...who just sits there while I win.  Because of all the above I cannot in my right mind recommend this game. For $0.25 maybe it's worth it. Maybe. If something happens and people actually start playing it then I will probably change my mind. Until then (which will probably be never) I don't think it's going to change.\n\nMakes me sad because I do want to play it.","March 26, 2014","false","1.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

That is all it does, and it does it well. There is no single player or co-operative component, no storyline and no other gamemodes, but at $3 a copy, I really can't complain - because what Gun Monkeys does do, it does a very good job of doing.\n\nThere are a few issues however, but these are not a fundamental problem with Gun Monkeys, but more with the audience that Gun Monkeys attracts. I should rather say; the lack of audience that Gun Monkeys attracts.\n\nThe hardest part about enjoying the game is that there are very few active players to enjoy it with. Luckily, there is none of that matchmaking ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t to struggle with, so if there are players online, you can just connect to a server and challenge whoever else is online to play against.\n\nThe core mechanics are great. The art style is exquisite, and the current build of Gun Monkeys is 99% bug-free. You'll have a whole host of interesting perks to buy and utilize, as well as some simple appearance modifiers that serve to enrich your 1v1 matches, which are even better when you have a friend to play against.\n\nMy only personal strife with the game is that the perks can be a bit unbalanced, which can be circumvented by just playing with players who are at the same experience level as you are.\n\nThere is support for achievements, and it should take around 9-12 hours to get them all (time to win 100 matches). Progression is stored serverside, as is customary with multiplayer games.\n\nI really think Gun Monkeys deserves a look at, and the developer (Dan, from Time, Gentlemen Please! and Been There, Done That) hasn't had the greatest time in terms of sales, so he really deserves your few dollars/euros/rubles.\n\n\n","October 6, 2013","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
