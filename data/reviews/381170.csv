However, for the money I wasn't expecting alot. I found it fun, not taxing on the brain, simple point and click, but be warned the UI isn't exactly friendly. It can also be a bit glitchy. I used the eye icon alot to see where I could interact with the scene, but overall I think this is a decent enough casual game, although it does feel a little like a school project.\n\nFor the couple of quid I spent I don't feel ripped off, and the time I spent playing was fun. Good as a time fiiller.\n","August 20, 2015","true","2.8"," 32 of 39 people (82%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","82","32","39","4","0"

You look at the price tag and see only $3; but that's for 40 minutes of painful gameplay. That's equivalent to spending $50 on a premium title with a long and captivating campaign. <-- No Brainer\n\nThe 25 locations remind me of static browser images mixed with some well-done water work from the developer, and a robotic character that awkwardly moves about the map.\n\nThe game really lacks the polish or excitement to charge this premium price. The worst part without a doubt is the navigation and item finding; without the help of the hint you can't determine what items are clickable or where to go. This is extremely frustrating and causes you to click the screen a ton without success.\n\nShould have been free or like $0.27; but don't buy it.\n\nAccidently ReviewedWas this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

After a click it seemed to adjust to my resolution, but then I can't click on the buttons. I have to click, in my case, a centimeter bellow the actual button, for the game to detect my action.","November 12, 2015","false","0.1"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","62","8","13","0","0"

Puzzles we're good, not to diffcult, didn't hurt my brain at least lol Even though using the hints a threw times the hints could of been better, most just said a little then "try looking in diary". Graphics arent to shabby. Good for the price.","November 29, 2015","true","2.3"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's not reviewed on any of the main adventure games websites and there aren't many reviews on Steam.\n\nWhen I started it up I was asked whether I wanted to play it on Easy or Hard. I chose Easy as I didn't want to get stuck and it appears that the actual adventure gameplay is the same. The Hard difficulty level just affects the complexity of some sliders / picture puzzles.\n\nOn beginning the game itself, the introduction was very simple with just a few paragraphs in a diary to read about how my character got to the island. I thought at this point that it was a little too simple and lame. The story itself is quite bare bones, but it holds interest for the duration.\n\nWhat I really liked about this game was the wonderful ambient, relaxing music. It's from Cyan Music and it really fitted the solitary exploration and puzzling of the game well. Other sounds in the game are the natural sounds of nature. There is no voice acting as there is nobody at all to speak to and this does not detract at all from the experience.\n\nThe graphics are simple but very effective, from snow scenes that give you a sense of the cold to plenty of water scenes and lush jungle / rainforest.\n\nThe interface is very user friendly.  Combining objects couldn't be simpler and the whole game is very intuitive. Hot spots do need careful searching though, though again there is help in the form of an eye icon that lights up all hotspots.\n\nI completed the game in 2 and a half hours and did not use any of the available hints. It could be completed faster with the help of the built in hint system, but where's the fun in that?\n\nI am not interested in Steam achievements, but for those that seek out 100% success, this game should be very straightforward in 2 playthroughs at each difficulty setting.\n\nI can recommend this game for a peaceful two to three hours experience.","December 14, 2015","true","3.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It is like a teleport to times of windows 98 with all of its ambient funk. It is calming, and nerve-wrecking at the same time, some puzzles are simple and some idiotic (f.ex. cage puzzle, how the f##k would I throw the f###g cage up to the air to catch a magpie?!). And the ending was quite disappointing.\n\nStill I recomend Lost in Paradise for all those who want to feel year 2001 again.","December 15, 2015","false","1.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I can't even get it to play because all of the buttons are not framed right. I have to click much lower than the actual button for it to work. I was like : "Meh I can deal with that, I'll try anyways" but then I got stuck on a text screen and there is no way to click on the arrow meant to turn the page. If this game was free, I STILL WOULDNT RECOMMEND IT, its a piece of thrash and the coding is utter garbage. Don't waste 25cents on this it's not worth it.
