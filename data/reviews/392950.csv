"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/recommended/392950/","lillje","Lilly (✿◠‿◠)","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lillje/","2609 products in account","Lost Lands: A Hidden Object Adventure has received quite a lot of negative reviews during the first days after it was released, and this because of 2 main reasons: on one hand, the game had a lot of bugs of various severity (from typos or bad translations to crashes, achievements unlocking and the impossibility to start the game on some systems); on the other hand, the game featured two achievements that were obtainable only by investing a huge amount of real money (around $200) that attracted the anger of a lot of people, including myself.\n\nHowever, the feedback that the community received from the developers is quite impressive – not only they changed the paid achievements but they also started to fix the major bugs and they are currently working on fixing the minor issues too, and all this in a very short period of time.\n\nThe game itself is not entirely bad, it’s quite repetitive but at the same time it was designed to hook you up, just like the standard smartphone/Facebook games. The fact that you have a limit to the actions you can do in one play session might or might not make you revisit the game next day, to progress some more.\n\nThe gameplay consists mainly in solving hidden object scenes that award some items used to complete the quests or collections or unlock additional bonuses. The fact that you have a most 15 locations (depending on your level, 1 - 15) that you visit over and over again adds to the monotony of the game – but on the bright side, after you solve 3-4 times the same hidden object scene, you learn exactly where all the objects are which makes it much easier afterwards.\n\nAdditionally, you can receive some chests from killing mobs, but unlocking them proves to be a real challenge – the puzzles are timed and most often of high difficulty.\n\nFor those that want to 1-click solve a chest puzzle or a hidden object scene, there is an in-game shop from which they can buy items in exchange for real money. The shop also provides all the objects needed for unlocking new locations or completing the collections. However, in comparison with most of the other pay-to-win games, all these items can be acquired also by playing the game, without spending a cent of real money, but of course these drop in small amounts so one is expected to invest a lot of patience and time to finish this game.\n\nThe objects in the hidden object scenes and the whole artwork is designed in the style of Artifex Mundi games, meaning that overall the artwork is nice and with vibrant colors; the objects are quite visible but at the same time hidden strategically so that they blend perfectly into the background, making them harder to be spotted, which is by definition one of the characteristics of this genre.\n\nAt the moment of writing this review, I think that the biggest complaint from the community remains the long time to achieve 100% - in order to do that one needs to revisit every location a few hundred times and all of this require energy; the energy pool is quite small and limited, allowing you to play only 4-5 hidden object scenes in a single play session - this will probably make people loose interest in the game quite quickly since they will not be able to enjoy the game for more than 10 minutes at once. Hopefully, the game parameters will be adjusted in the future.\n\nI decided to give this game a positive review, not only because it is an enjoyable experience (despite the long grind for 100% achievements) but also because of the constructive attitude from the developers, that are actively working on improving our gaming experience.\n\nMore reviews on the Lilly's Corner Curator page","October 11, 2015","true","62.6"," 81 of 93 people (87%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","87","81","93","0","6"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/recommended/392950/","vicrabb","Vic=HKC=","http://steamcommunity.com/id/vicrabb/","1793 products in account","Lost Lands: A Hidden Object Adventure is based on the universe of Lost Lands, a hidden object adventure series set in another dimension or I suppose so because the games are done by the same people, with the same title. However, here, you take in your hands the destiny of the Elven Nation, crashed on a lost island, rebuilding their civilization and ready to set sail elsewhere if only a magical storm wasn't preventing them to do so.\n\nThis is the first free-to-play released by Five-BN. The second one, Lost Lands: Mahjong, shares the same story, the same quests and the same mechanics. It means that apart the core gameplay (hidden objects - mahjong), nothing changed when the second was released. I've played Mahjong first because I love the solitaire version of this game and A Hidden Object Adventure came after. It also means that the majority of this review will be identical to the one I did for Mahjong.\n\nThe gameplay itself is to find objects in different locations: a list of words, a list of shapes, with also a cycle of day and night as some quests required a "night", in other words, the scene will be only partially visible, as if you were carrying a torch. Generally, the scenes can be done easily, even if objects are changing places. It's pretty rare to be out of time.\n\nQuests, while needing explorations for anything (weapons, tools, ressources, etc..), can also involve "fights" with enemies, repairing buildings or using tools. Also, the more you're earning experience, the more you're leveling up and the more you're unlocking. There are also chests you can open, with various minigames (and not always easy). Everything is timed and the explorations, as the chests, cost energy.\n\nAnd that's bothering me, the energy regenerating slowly unless you buy some potions with the crystals you're earning. Crystals are pretty rare but there is the easy way: spent real money to acquire them (or to acquire more golds). Gold is mainly used for weapons for example. Here's an idea for the cost: 10 crystals = 0.88 euros - I've checked the next price and it's already nearing 10 euros).\n\nI don't mind having quests to do and I don't mind the level up system to access new locations. Even the shop isn't really bothering, as far as you can use the gold you're earning. However, preventing me to play a game because of a decreased energy on Steam, that's something I can't imagine. For me, that kind of gameplay is reminding me of my Facebook games time. Weirdly enough, it would have been on Facebook, I would have find it normal. Here, on Steam, I'm not at ease with the concept. Ubisoft released games about CSI and Assassin's Creed on Facebook, yet, the main series were totally different.\n\nYou'll probably find it weird that I'm bothered by the Facebook-like when the game is a free-to-play and that the concept of the energy is also there to push you to buy some (the game is also released on Android and iOS devices). But that's my feeling. Many people will feel that they're trapped and will want to advance. However, I tend to use a simple thought to avoid spending money: there is no rush. You're there for fun (I'm not reading the story though).\n\nAs for the rest, the graphics are acceptable and pleasant, the soundtrack being the same. If you played any other Lost Lands, you'll be in an familiar setting.\n\nAs I love hidden objects, I can overcome easily the energy bar and the game is still enjoyable. It's free basically, so try it but DON'T FALL INTO THE "NEED ENERGY" TRAP. If there are indeed micro-transactions, don't fall in that pit of addiction. You don't need to go forward immediately. Just quit the game and come back later. It's the best way to play these kind of games, because after all, you're not going to be attacked by another player, your quests aren't timed and besides, why would you rush?\n\nLast for all, why did I thumb up both games when only the gameplay changed? I'm enjoying them, they're free and besides, it's not like I'm wasting my money here...","April 12","true","44.6"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","22","23","0","1"

Biggest Steam community complaint is microtransactions that NEVER, EVER need to be done, unless overly impatient or have money to burn.  This game reminds me of Found and Awakenings mixed together, using the best elements of both of these Big Fish free to play games.  I played both of those for about a year before my computer's memory got wiped and I lost both, and I NEVER EVER spent any money.\n\nSecond biggest Steam community complaint: TIME.  This is a long term game and not meant to be played in just a few hours, maybe a few months, but not hours.  It is also meant to be played a little at a time, not all at once. (Basically playable only until the energy runs out or gets too low.  Then the gamer goes away for several hours while energy recharges.) This is a coffee break or lunch break game.\n\nThe most important thing a gamer of this type of game needs to remember is not to waste their gems or their hints.  Both are hard to come by and need to be left alone to accumulate.  Again unless overly impatient do not buy gems or spend them, just let them accumulate.  As a matter of fact let EVERYTHING accumulate chests, food, items, EVERYTHING because eventually the gamer will need a quantity.","October 5, 2015","true","136.3"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","22","27","0","8"

This one, despite its supposed price tag will definitely cost you AT LEAST that in order to play it at any sort of clip which would be any fun at all.

(Seriously? What is this Facebook?)\n- Bugs that instead of being fixed just included a work around in the changelog. (Really you want me to do bad on purpose to slow the game progress even further, not just once but repeatedly?)\n- Energy costs to explore levels rises disproportionably to the rate your energy rises so you can play less the further into the game you progress\n- Puzzle variation, Each zone only has 3 places max that each object is placed, so when exploring the same zone over and over as required by the game the objects will always be in the same place.\n- Repetitive I don't want to explore the same screen 50+ times if not only do the objects only exist in 3 places but it's always the same objects.\n- Level Entry Item cost. Not only do levels require energy to enter many levels require multiple items (Example: Coal) to enter, so to get into said level you need 50 Energy, but oh wait you also need 2 coal go farm this other level for 50 energy each time twice and hope to get a coal each time.\n- Game originally introduced with steam achievements you actually had to pay real money to get (not a small amount either.) Those have since been removed but all achievements still are not attainable unless you are willing to do bad at each puzzle over 50 times, with the energy system this is ridiculous.\n- Game pace, I don't want to be playing this weeks from now let alone months or years from now. I want to beat it and move on, Current design will take months if not years to complete playing 10 minutes at a time twice a day.\n\nPro and Con:\n- Music, this could be considered a pro because it's relaxing, but there is no variation. Do you really want to listen to this same music for the years it takes you to complete this?\n\nOverall score: 4/10 I am basing this score only in comparison to other hidden object games, and honestly it's only that high because of the amazing artwork. If you can't a non energy based hidden object game or like playing the same facebook game for years try this. If not just buy a better hidden object game.\n","October 6, 2015","false","25.1"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","85","17","20","2","0"

It far exceeds expectation.\n\nI just the game partially based on this: ooo looks great, music is great, it plays on a toaster and has easy achievements..woot - then I play it....\n\nThis game is clearly modeled after casual social media games. Everything you do requires either energy, or certain object acquired through playing certain hidden object levels, which, yep - require energy.\n\nEnergy: this fills up automatically - at 1 energy per 2 minutes. There are spots you can build up to reduce this time, bridge mainly, but they are costly and only take away 30 seconds totally. If you are lucky to get a talisman that halves that, then it could be bearable, but only if it was the norm, and not just a 24 hr drop.\n\nThe game map is made up of these little homes/towns that, when you click on them, you can do your hidden object levels. But each on cost a certain amount of energy, and as you progress the levels require more and more energy.\n\nAchievements: Now this is funny. Some achievements don't work, aka aren't in sync. You will see the majority of all the achievements are made of a statistic out of 5. 5/5 = achievement done. Seems great, right? For any given level, to get 5/5 you really have to complete it 150 times. For monster deaths, 5/5 =200 times.\n\n150 repeats x 30 energy cost ( assuming all the levels have been "leveled up" to rank 5, then that will be the least amount of energy required, some are 70 energy)  = 4500 total energy for the lowest costing level.\n\n4500 energy x 90 seconds ( recharge time for 1 energy) = 405,000 total seconds for the lowest costing level = 6750 minutes = 112.5 hours of time.  Just let that sink in for a second. Yeah. Compound on that fact when some of the levels are 70/75 energy each.\n\nOn top of that the achievements are faulty for me, showing me that i have 5/5 but on steam it shows a perpetual 4/5:\nexaminer\nexplorer\nexperienced\ntrader\nfan of chests\nrich man\n\nNow many of the levels and monster defeats are calculated correctly, but if you haven't started this game already, then it's really not worth all the time and effort and the huge drop in your achievement percentage (if you are a steam completionist/achievement hunter).\n\nIf you are like me, who started this game when it first came out, I would use some developer tools/memory tools and just give yourself 99999 energy and money. Personally for me I have to see the game through, and I will probably have to decompile and recompile certain aspects of the game - just to get my achievements, which are still stuck at lvl 4 despite being completed for weeks now.\n\nIf the developers could fix these issues the game would be great, even now the graphics and music are still amazing enough to make it almost bearable. Almost, but not quite.","November 21, 2015","false","73.2"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","14","18","0","2"

Like all energy based games, patiences is the key.  Following are a few tips that may be usefull :\n\nCash Items\nIf you want to spend money on it (wich is fine, devs gotta live, right?), I'd recommend the hint giving item so you learn every object location in every stage. There seem to be about two image placement type per location.  Playing the game this way will help you build your memory, and speed up your process.  Avoid spending money on energy as it replenish over time and at level-up.  Your energy also increase by 10 at each level-up.  There are a few structures that act as free level-up, or that decrease the energy cooldown.\n(edit : my bad, more then two item placement layout, but those come later when you "level-up" a location.  the number is still fixed so initial comment still hold.)\n(edit : when I mean speed up you process, I mean it... actual locations take a few tens of seconds at most when you get around to it)\n\nPlay regularly, but briefly\nPlay this three times a day (morning, lunch and evening), or more if you have the time, then switch to something else while your energy build back up. There are also structures you may repair that will yield various bonus (experience, energy, building materials, chest, etc) after a specific amount of time.\n\nBe smart about leveling-up\nLeveling up fully refill your energy (anyone is getting the MAA feeling yet?).  It may be good to delay (waiting on quest rewards) or speed up (kill a few mobs) your leveling depending on your remaining energy and/or time left to play.\n\nDid someone say puzzle?\nOne of the best part of the game are the chests. They also need a small amout of energy to use, but unlike location, the cost does not increase with continuous success. They will contain various type of loot depending on the type.  The puzzles (mini-game) involved in opening them are fun and all involve spatial cognition, such as : linking dots of various color without crossing them, moving stones to let something through, linking gems with a beam of light, etc.  They are somewhat easy, but made more challenging by the time limit you have.\n\nLoot\nIf you understand the basics of the game, including leveling up locations (they will give one additional drop per level, up to +5 from the basic 1... at least that's my guess for now), you'll find it's not that grindy of a game.  Use the structures and log in reapedly briefly (as stated above) to maximize your profit.\n\nA word on achievement\nYes, they seem to be more difficult to get then it's Mahjong counterpart.  But would you rather have 100% of easy achievements (that everyone have)?  Or a few rares ones?","April 30","true","29.6"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Energy and microtransaction items being pretty much required ends up being a frustration. Coins being your main currency for most things, but all the energy items and other "boosters" requiring gems, for which your only reliable source is exchanging real money.\n- Annoying in-game pop-up style ads advertising limited-time "deals" on cash shop items get ludicrous. I'd been playing on and off for less than a day, and had a good half dozen of them on screen. You can't dismiss them, only wait for the timer to run down.\n- The story is pretty weak, generic fantasy fare. I really couldn't bring myself to care about what was going on.\n- Characters are all generic fantasy stereotypes. Elves are all stuck-up and condescending, Humans are greedy, etc.\n- The intro cutscene would be much better off being a one-time thing when you first start, rather than playing every time you load up the game, which, due to having to wait for energy regen, is likely to be several times a day depending on how you play. And, due to the weak story, I didn't care the first time.\n- No way to choose your scene mode, which is frustrating when you're given a quest to play a scene in a specific mode (I.E. Night mode).\n- Achievements are ridiculous. You have to complete the top tier of the game's in-game achievement system for it to count towards your Steam achievements. As mentioned, some of those require spending hundreds of real dollars to complete.\n\nOverall, this could be good, but it's hindered by the usual port-from-mobile BS. I'd rather pay $5-10 and remove the cash shop garbage in favour of using the in-game currency (coins) for everything.","September 26, 2015","false","3.4"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","6","8","0","0"

The graphics are very lovely; the puzzles are appropriately difficult when needed, very fun, and there is a lot to do in this game. Truthfully, though, there is too much. Too much to do. Too much necessary to unlock achievements and new areas. Too much use of energy to perform tasks. Granted, I haven't done much in the game at this point but I feel like I am limited by not paying to increase my ability to play longer. Given the content I feel I could invest quite a bit of my time in larger chunks, but that pesky energy reserve dwindles fast. Too fast to get anything done for more than a handful of minutes at a time. Especially at low levels.\n\nThis is frustrating, because I love, dearly, hidden object games. I understand that this is a free game and that money coming in for the developers efforts is from paying real money for ingame items. I get that. I've played many mobile games with this feature, without ever paying for items due to my patience with them and limited time to access them. However, I think this game could have benefited from a fixed base selling price for revenue, and let the game unlock and develop at its own pace per the player's usage, with additional payments being a luxury or to enhance gameplay, not advance it. I also feel that because there is a crippling limit when not paying for playability that the achievements take far longer than necessary to complete. If the game was more open and already paid for, then working toward each achievement would feel more like an acomplishment than a burden.\n\nI may change my mind later on, giving it more time to develop, before I settle either way definitely. For now though, I find more annoyances and cons than fun to recommend to others. There are some great ideas and an interesting set up here, just executed a little too mobile phone-like for the value that Steam usually carries.","January 5","false","2.7"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

And while that's freakin' weird for a hidden object game, the shop itself seems reasonably priced (as far as these things go). Packages of currency ranging from $1 to $20.  Skip to 3:30 in this video for the cash shop info: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66TLki6J83w&feature=youtu.be\n\nThe graphics are actually quite lovely- they animations of the hair and faces of the characters is top-notch. The music and sounds are calm, relaxing, and fit the atmosphere. The menus and text do look a little plain or 'cheap', but that's a minor issue for me. The game attempts to put a serious RPG skin over the hidden object gameplay, and it succeeds. It reminds me a LOT of 'Puzzle Quest' in that regard.\n\nIf you're a fan of the hidden object genre (I'm not, really), and don't mind the slightly unnerving presence of a cash shop and energy system, I see no reason to not suggest checking this game out. We'll have to see long-term how the energy system works out, though.

Graphically the game is nice, with a good art style and the music is not noteworthy but doesn't get int he way either. The chief problem is the dreadful amount of waiting you have to do, due to the energy system holdovers form it being a phone game.\n\nOverall, it's not a bad game... for the short bursts you can enjoy it in.\n\n(Formerly you were required to spend many hundreds of dollars of real money to get all the achievements, but please note that as of 9/30/2015) this is no longer true.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadstanley/recommended/392950/","deadstanley","DeadStanley","http://steamcommunity.com/id/deadstanley/","142 products in account",""Lost Lands" is a fun and addictive hidden-object game that offers a much longer gaming experience than traditional hidden-object games do. The story isn't necessarily compelling, but for me that wasn't an issue as the enjoyment I got out of this game was found in the various activities which were made available.\n\nBefore continuing, it needs to be stated that this is a free-to-play game with optional paid services. It follows the same formula that many Facebook games do, which is that you have only limited play-time available to you before you need to let the game "recharge" your access to it. This is represented in "Lost Lands" as energy and almost any action you perform will consume it. Instead of waiting for it to recharge naturally, you can opt to use premium currency to in turn purchase in-game items which will return energy to you.\n\nSo that opens the door for two types of real-money purchases that you can make. The first is that you can purchase the premium currency under a multi-tier pricing model. The second is that after you gain an experience level you are rewarded with the option of purchasing a deeply discounted set of items for real-money, which most of the time will include the premium currency. Of them the second option seemed to be the better value based on my play style.\n\nFrom the start of the game, NPCs will be appearing to present you with quests. These quests come in the form of exploring hidden-object scenes, solving puzzle chests, completing item collections, killing roaming monsters, or repairing the Lost Lands. All of these actions will grant you with items that will be recycled into completing more of the same activities. Additionally you will be earning experience points and gaining levels. Gaining levels will instantly recharge your energy meter as well as permanently extend it. Higher levels will also unlock gated hidden-object scenes.\n\nQuesting will be the mechanism used to drive you through the core of the game -- 15 unique hidden-object scenes. Each scene has the potential to be leveled up as well, and upon doing so will basically unlock a new configuration of hidden-objects within it. This will add to the variety and keep you on your toes.\n\nHaving played through the majority of the game, I've never come across a situation where I was forced to purchase premium currency to progress. While I did spend some money, it was never necessary to do so. Everything the game has to offer can be reasonably obtained by playing normally with the recharge meter.","December 23, 2015","true","113.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Also there are various other puzzles when you open treasure chests which are also fun.\n\nIt should be noted however that there is a fault in the game where you can not acess one location, the floating isles, without a Griffin, the griffin is in another location which is locked until you gain acess to the floating isles. The only way to get past this is by buying into one or other location with crystals, which you don't get many of. This may end up forcing you to buy crystals and so forced to spend money on a "free" game.  To get around this you simply need to make sure that you don't spend too many of the crystals that you get when you go up a level, you get 5 each time and you need 20 to acess a locked level without the requirements. I understand that a similar thing happens a little later so you will need 20 for when you hit about level 18 and then another 20 when you reach level 21\n\nIt should be easily do-able but but when I tried to restart the game from the begining with this in mind I could see no option whatsoever to do this, I even tried to delete the local content and download the game again but I was still stuck in the same place","October 12, 2015","false","20.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mickmane/recommended/392950/","Mickmane","Mickmane","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mickmane/","397 products in account","Oddly compelling Hidden Object game.\n\nLevel 10, so far it went well for me without using real money to buy in-game stuff. For anyone like me, worried that they'd accidentally buy something; Steam overlay pops up wanting you to confirm the purchase, with a convenient cancel button. Works well for me too. I will probably buy something to support the developer when I'm done with the game (though not more than I'd pay for any other HO game). He deserves some money for the care put into it. And it's fun.\n\nThe energy needed to play the scenes recharges at a good rate, and exceeds max while sleeping. Plus, levelling up refills to max (sadly not more if you already have max or more energy).\n\nThere are various locations, more and more unlocking as you progress. They are re-used, but as you progress the items to be found get more and more, only a handful to find at a time that are renewed as you find them. I don't think random clicking would get anyone anywhere. On the other hand, objects often enough have the same locations (I have not figured out yet what has the placement change - it's a surprise when they do), so some are easily found if you remember where they are. I do like the way the game does these. (Btw, each scene has a limited time. Not being able to evade that would seriously spoil my fun.)\n\nThe graphics are very nice, much care has been taken to create the locations and the map, and put the items to be found into sensible spots.\n\nSo far I've seen 3 different modes for hidden object finding: by words, by silhouettes, and by words or silhouettes with only small part of the scene visible (a circle you can move around). Which you get seems to be random (with the quests to do at night - the small-part-only-visible version - it might take several attempts to get that mode).\n\nThere are also minigames/puzzles for opening chests with useful stuff. I rather like that (though would enjoy that more without timer).\n\nThere is even a point to rummaging around locations for random junk, though the actual hidden objects and the things you're digging out of the locations story-wise don't match.\n\nThere's also monsters to beat, special items to put together, and buildings to be repaired, for which you have to find (in the HO locations), or purchase (with in-game gold or gems that you earn by playing) different things. Another nice way to add different activities. Plus, you collect stuff that adds various bonuses, from faster energy recharging to getting more xp from quests. And there are enough free hint/solve items dropped (at least for me - I prefer not to use them if I can help it at all).\n\nThe quests you get for progression and unlocking more locations have that 'just one more' effect on me. Maybe for some people it would be hard to resist buying stuff with real money to continue rather than waiting a bit. Only you know how good a grip you have on your wallet. :)","September 25, 2015","true","253.6"," 11 of 24 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","11","24","0","1"

I'm a little sorry that it has this many negative reviews, because it's a game that is chill to just take 10 minutes off, and do something that is not very taxing or adrenalinerushing.\n\nPeople who are looking to play this game from scratch need to look at it in either of two ways.\n1. A game that I will spend a ridiculous amount of money on - like really - an obscene amount of money on - to complete it in the fastest way possible.\n2. Make it a part of my daily routine for 10-20 minutes every day, and make it a slower progress.\n\nFor acheivement hunters: This game will take a while to complete. Not in terms of playtime, because the investment is not really that much, but in terms of real time, where you will daily log on to play this for a short interval.\n\nAs of now I have logged into this game daily for 3 months with only 40 hours play as of writing this review. I only have 8% of the acheivements, since they are logged in a wierd way. You proceed in stages, which are tracked in the game's internal acheievement system, so it's not like it will then take me another 27 months to get all the 100% acheivements, but it will definitely take some time, if I want to do it without spending any actual, human money on it.\n\nI have gathered that initially there were quite a few problems regarding acheivements and typoes in the chat that gave the game a rather unprofessional appearance. But this is one of those games where the devs are fixing errors reported by the community.\n(For example there is an acheivement that requires for you to spend gems, which are bought with real money. The community didn't like that you had to pay to get acheivements. In response, the game now awards a small amount of gems every 5 consecutive days logged in, and upon levelling up, which makes the acheivement possible without actually spending any money)\n\nThis is a good game that you do not just complete overnight. You will need patience and persistence. If you're up for a challenge, do take up the game.","December 17, 2015","true","42.8"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

The "free to play" model kills any chance of the game ever being good. You run out of energy very quickly and you only get 1 back every 2-3 minutes or so. It takes 15 energy to explore an area and the exploration only takes about a minute or two. So for every half hour or so, you can play for 2 minutes. Or you could spend real money to buy the potions to continue playing.\n\nThe gameplay is sort of boring. It's basically one of those games where you try to find the objects on the page. You click the objects and when you get them all, it ends the level. The "combat" with monsters ins't combat. You juts buy the item needed to defeat it, then click it to defeat it. There's no chance to fail against monsters. You either have the item to beat it or you don't.\n\nThe graphics are nice. I liked the look of the map and the characters.\n\nOverall, poor gameplay mixed with some bad free to play mechanics makes for a pretty bad game. I wouldn't suggest anyone play this unless you really like the wait to play or pay to play model.","October 9, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Lost Lands attempts to minimise this by adding several features:\n\n*upgradable structures\n*harvestable resources\n*puzzle boxes\n*enemies which drop materials and collection items.\n\nThere is also an ongoing storyline in which you, as an ancient elf king, must befriend several races as you try to restore your race's former glory.\n\nOf course, as an ongoing hidden object game, you will find yourself level grinding during some quests, but that can't be helped in this genre.

It is nice that sometimes the objects change place or you get different items to look for as the quests require you to search the same area over and over again.\n\nCons:\n-It's free to play so enter the micro-transactions! It would be nicer to just pay for a game and getting to enjoy it.\n-every hidden object scene costs "energy" (at least 20). Considering it takes a whopping 5 hours to restore 100 energy you are initially given you won't be playing this game for that long per session.\n-it even costs energy to open a chest, which is an actual reward after a hidden object scene!\n-quests usually require you to collect items you get as rewards but you don't always get your item or you only get 1 while your quest requires 5. Imagine a quest that requires you to get 5x "nails", 5x "wooden board", 3x "rope". Your quest will take days.\n-There is no other thing to do here than hidden object scenes (oh and waiting offcourse)\n","March 15","false","166.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The puzzles have become a bit repeatitive as you can only access hidden object areas based on you'er current level.   Even though there is gold coins in the game, the real currency is diamonds, which Steam and Five-bn games are more than willing to sell you for real US $.  I haven't bought any yet, but I'm not finished with this game yet either...so...\nOther than that, one aspect I think I saw others criticize,but I really kinda liked, was the energy meter.  if you don't have enough energy points you can play an area,  or open a chest, ECT, ECT.  So after you play out all your energy points you have to stop and let the energy build back up or use items that regenerate energy that you find as treasure (also available for real $ in the store).  What ended up happening was I would use my energy up and then I'd play something else.  It was great for 5 minutes here and 10 minutes there!  I can see why others would hate that part, but it worked well for me as my game time grows more and more limited as my baby son grows bigger and bigger.","February 20","true","38.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Can't play for long, though, because energy to explore locations is used up too fast. Only one major complaint: Once you unlock the Potions location, which dispenses a potion every 12 hrs or so, 9 out of 10 potions are the type that you can't use to boost your energy.  What is up with that?  Very misleading. Also, if you're just logging in after being away for several hours, and your energy is back to being full, don't click on your Energy dispensing location, which dispenses 10 energy every hour. When your energy is already full, this does not add 10 to your total. It's wasted. The board and locations are vivid and colorful, the objects are fairly easy to find once you've played that location a few times, though it does rotate through 5 or 6 different object placements scenarios.  Perform tasks and make collections for rewards.  A nice way to pass the time without undue stress.

The puzzles have become a bit repeatitive as you can only access hidden object areas based on you'er current level.   Even though there is gold coins in the game, the real currency is diamonds, which Steam and Five-bn games are more than willing to sell you for real US $.  I haven't bought any yet, but I'm not finished with this game yet either...so...\nOther than that, one aspect I think I saw others criticize,but I really kinda liked, was the energy meter.  if you don't have enough energy points you can play an area,  or open a chest, ECT, ECT.  So after you play out all your energy points you have to stop and let the energy build back up or use items that regenerate energy that you find as treasure (also available for real $ in the store).  What ended up happening was I would use my energy up and then I'd play something else.  It was great for 5 minutes here and 10 minutes there!  I can see why others would hate that part, but it worked well for me as my game time grows more and more limited as my baby son grows bigger and bigger.","February 20","true","38.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The story is actually pretty interesting, and there are a lot of unique elements to the world it is set in. HOG and puzzle game play is nicely done, and they change the placement of items often enough to ensure playing at the same location many times does not feel stale.\n\nThat said, I am never enthusiastic about these kinds of energy based games. You spend 9/10ths of your time waiting for your energy bar to fill up, and even with level up increases, I still only get enough energy to play 5 (very short) rounds before I have to wait again.  This is immersion breaking, and frustrating. I would happily play a purchasable version of this game to bypass that painful mechanic, but as it stands, the only way to avoid constant waiting to continue is through micropurchases, which falls into the trap of feeling extorting. This is the kind of flaw that gives the F2P genre a bad name.\n\nI'm giving this a 'recommend' because it is, overall, a well made game. But I am very unsure how long I will be playing it due to the frustration of the waiting game. And I'd be much quicker to support the makers, monetarily, if it didn't feel like the game style penalizes you if you don't. So its a 'recommend' but with major asterisks.","February 13","true","385.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The energy bar is small and most game sessions you will only get 4 or 5 HOG scenes per play session consisting of about 10 to 20 minutes. However, part of the jackpot of some of your victories is a puzzle chest (about 8 varieties), and very little energy is needed to play those chests. Thus you can usually always end a play session playing a couple puzzle chest extending your play time. The chest themselves are for the most part challenging.\n\nAs far as the HOG scenes, the hidden objects are nicely illustrated and all but a couple are named correctly. (flute is misnamed and one object gets a name change 2/3 of the way thorugh, and one oject takes advantage of synonyms), interestingly, since this extended play game involves going to all the HOG scenes (about 15) multiple times it eventually morphs from a  Hidden object game to a memory game.  This is the only HOG I have ever played where I did not mind the timer clock. Eventually it became fun for me to beat the clock at the first stage, trying to remember all the hidden spaces. My guess is that an object will have about four hidey holes within an HOG scene. So its never a matter of replaying an HOG scene and going to the last hidey hole.\n\nThe music is excellent, the graphics are great, but the story telling is lame. The way they tried to tell the story did not work at all for me. It bascially felt like they tagged on a story after they created the game world. The story was totally uninvolving and I ususally just clicked through the text.\n\nOTOH, the game achievments and game collections drove me to put dozens and dozens  of hours into this game. If you are a completionist, this game will drive you like no other HOG. However, the designers negleted to put in about 4 game pieces so it is impossible to get 100 % on the game collection part.\n\nI got a lot of hours and enjoyment out of this game and bought something for 2 bucks just as a nod to support the developers.  I hope they build on this game and do another.","January 27","true","84.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's actually NOT pay-to-play if you don't mind waiting, which is my case. There is absolutely nothing in the game that cannot be gained unless you pay money. Everything is accessible.\n\nIn my case, I play this game about 10-15 minutes a day. That's all I need to spend all my energy, have a little fun, complete a quest or two, and then that's it. I come back the following day, my energy is full, I spend it, open a few chests, and close the game again. And so on.\n\nPersonally, I have absolutely no problem with this type of games, especially if it's not pay-to-win. It doesn't matter if others pay for gems and you don't, because it's not putting them above you, making them stronger than you, or anything. It's a single player game. You go to your pace, and that's it. I don't care if some people has finished the game 15 times faster than I did because they paid real money. I like this game, and I don't mind waiting for energy; I go and play something else once I'm done with my daily energy and that's it.\n\nPlus, and this it important: every time you log in daily (whether you spend all your energy or just log in), you progress in the daily rewards table, and that table gives you 6 gems every 6 days. So stop complaining about real money, you CAN get gems just by logging in. You can get all locations, all items, all achievements for FREE. You just have to play 10-15 minutes a day until you get there.\n\nIf you like hidden objects games and don't mind the wait, then this game is very well done, and I plan on getting another from this series once I'm done with this one. It's free to play, so how about you just get it, try it, and judge for yourself?","February 8","true","69.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Can't play for long, though, because energy to explore locations is used up too fast. Only one major complaint: Once you unlock the Potions location, which dispenses a potion every 12 hrs or so, 9 out of 10 potions are the type that you can't use to boost your energy.  What is up with that?  Very misleading. Also, if you're just logging in after being away for several hours, and your energy is back to being full, don't click on your Energy dispensing location, which dispenses 10 energy every hour. When your energy is already full, this does not add 10 to your total. It's wasted. The board and locations are vivid and colorful, the objects are fairly easy to find once you've played that location a few times, though it does rotate through 5 or 6 different object placements scenarios.  Perform tasks and make collections for rewards.  A nice way to pass the time without undue stress.

The thing I don't like is that you are limited by how much energy you have, which is slow to return. I play once a day and have unlocked all of the locations, but have not run out of missions yet. Some reviews say that you have to "pay for diamonds to complete", I suppose this is true if you don't want to be patient. I have not put any money toward this game and enjoyed myself, although I do enjoy Hidden Object Games (HOG).\n\nYou have to play through each "area" quite a lot, so sometimes they change the positions of the objects, so that it nice.

I enjoy the variety of hidden object and mini games.  The artwork is nice and the HOG are nicely blended to the backgrounds without being impossible.  I agree with other reviews about the limited energy being annoying, but feel if we could trade in some of the building objects for energy it would help fix that issue.  I also think we should be able to trade in some access tools for others.  Also, if things in the store cost x number of gems OR y amount of coins would be nice.\n\nIf there were more of these games on STEAM, then we could rotate through them until our energy regens....","February 8","true","114.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I enjoy it when I want to relax for a few minutes. The graphics are not bad. I turn off the music in most games I play. What I have heard of the music in this game is relaxing enough. I don't pay-to-play for games like this. The small amount of "energy" available means that my playtime is short.\n\nThe not so great\nThe spelling and grammar need to be edited by a native English speaker. Especially a few words are outright wrong. For instance, they use the picture of a clarinet but call it a flute? There is too much of the same thing to do over and over in the end.

The story is actually pretty interesting, and there are a lot of unique elements to the world it is set in. HOG and puzzle game play is nicely done, and they change the placement of items often enough to ensure playing at the same location many times does not feel stale.\n\nThat said, I am never enthusiastic about these kinds of energy based games. You spend 9/10ths of your time waiting for your energy bar to fill up, and even with level up increases, I still only get enough energy to play 5 (very short) rounds before I have to wait again.  This is immersion breaking, and frustrating. I would happily play a purchasable version of this game to bypass that painful mechanic, but as it stands, the only way to avoid constant waiting to continue is through micropurchases, which falls into the trap of feeling extorting. This is the kind of flaw that gives the F2P genre a bad name.\n\nI'm giving this a 'recommend' because it is, overall, a well made game. But I am very unsure how long I will be playing it due to the frustration of the waiting game. And I'd be much quicker to support the makers, monetarily, if it didn't feel like the game style penalizes you if you don't. So its a 'recommend' but with major asterisks.","February 13","true","385.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

F2P, single player, point-n-click game with beautiful artwork, hidden item quests (built in timer) but you visit the same locations so memory helps speed up the search, puzzles and built in store ($ required), though very doable, as far as I understand how this game works, with out using purchased items.

Lost Lands attempts to minimise this by adding several features:\n\n*upgradable structures\n*harvestable resources\n*puzzle boxes\n*enemies which drop materials and collection items.\n\nThere is also an ongoing storyline in which you, as an ancient elf king, must befriend several races as you try to restore your race's former glory.\n\nOf course, as an ongoing hidden object game, you will find yourself level grinding during some quests, but that can't be helped in this genre. Overall, it is an excellent game with an interesting cast of characters and enough variety to justify coming back frequently.\n\nRating: 8/10 for its genre, 6/10 in general","March 11","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I dont know who would apriciate a counter above his or hers  head while he or she is tryng to play somthing. The game is very good -especially the option to reproduce gems and gold by quests suprised me pleasantly -only to disapoint me even more when i hit the paywall of it. What i really dont like is it takes real money to be able to participate in the game and progress normaly in it that is a huge downfall for this game, there is the option to wait and all but that takes ages (to make you pay). A very well made game and i hope it will get a better gameplay concept then actual paying for another step or time in the game. But still there is alot of effort putten into it and the makers are obviously looking for a way to earn their invested money back and profit at the same time-which is normal.- But basing the whole gameplay on that is rather to say the least anyoing to players that are actually interested in this game, and undermines the real value or enjoyment of the artstile by monetasing it.  But the game is fun and interesting and very well made and chalenging. However i would say No thank you- to this.\n\n;-}","March 11","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","1"

Great graphics - without being too much - very easy to navigate, even with a trackpad on a laptop rather than a mouse and desktop, and I really like that there are some different characters that you interact with. Extra bonus that all of the bad guys are freely wondering on the map in the background and you can click on each one for more info. You get enough rewards ect from winning challenges that I don't feel the need to make in-game perchases. Definatly recommend for anywho who likes pretty, relatively simple puzzel games, especially with elves!

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dajjer/recommended/392950/","Dajjer","Dajjer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Dajjer/","717 products in account","Highly recommended but be aware of what you are getting.\n\nThe game is designed like a pay to win game but you can actually play the full game without spending a dime.  The energy bar is small and most game sessions you will only get 4 or 5 HOG scenes per play session consisting of about 10 to 20 minutes. However, part of the jackpot of some of your victories is a puzzle chest (about 8 varieties), and very little energy is needed to play those chests. Thus you can usually always end a play session playing a couple puzzle chest extending your play time. The chest themselves are for the most part challenging.\n\nAs far as the HOG scenes, the hidden objects are nicely illustrated and all but a couple are named correctly. (flute is misnamed and one object gets a name change 2/3 of the way thorugh, and one oject takes advantage of synonyms), interestingly, since this extended play game involves going to all the HOG scenes (about 15) multiple times it eventually morphs from a  Hidden object game to a memory game.  This is the only HOG I have ever played where I did not mind the timer clock. Eventually it became fun for me to beat the clock at the first stage, trying to remember all the hidden spaces. My guess is that an object will have about four hidey holes within an HOG scene. So its never a matter of replaying an HOG scene and going to the last hidey hole.\n\nThe music is excellent, the graphics are great, but the story telling is lame. The way they tried to tell the story did not work at all for me. It bascially felt like they tagged on a story after they created the game world. The story was totally uninvolving and I ususally just clicked through the text.\n\nOTOH, the game achievments and game collections drove me to put dozens and dozens  of hours into this game. If you are a completionist, this game will drive you like no other HOG. However, the designers negleted to put in about 4 game pieces so it is impossible to get 100 % on the game collection part.\n\nI got a lot of hours and enjoyment out of this game and bought something for 2 bucks just as a nod to support the developers.  I hope they build on this game and do another.","January 27","true","84.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you are one of those people who like hidden object games, the only drawback is the energy system.  When you run out of energy, you need to either buy more (with real money) or wait until it refills on it's own, which takes a while.  Overall , I'd say its pretty good for a free game.","February 11","true","151.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And just when searching the same old areas becomes easy, there's a challenging puzzle to solve! I like that there's some thought/strategy involved with that.\n\nThe graphics are pretty nice and I like the music (turned down).

I understand the point of having achievements (thus the 3 stars being on a time limit), but I highly disagree with the player losing completely once the time goes down.  It encourages random clicking along the screen, while making it near impossible for players to look around and also enjoy the art and environment your artsists and designers so lovingly created.\n\nCertain people will always have trouble finding specific objects, until they have begun to recognize and memorize how the objects look.  However, this method greatly punishes new players of this game or genre, while inducing panic in players that might enjoy spending as much time as they like.  I like the art, and the story, and the somewhat integration of resource management, but you don't let all player types play the game as they want.  You don't let players take their time in a game that challenges the mind.  If you did that, you would gain even more fans of this game.","April 20","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Still, it's not bad or broken by any means, and while it offers microtransactions they're hardly necessary to play the game. So if you're just looking to slay some time and have grown bored of Solitare, try this out. It's not like you have anything to lose.\n\nAlso, I noticed that there's another game similar to this, only you play mahjong instead of looking for hiden objects. And apart from the gameplay, it's practically identical to this one; it's got the same graphics, the same story, and the same collection system, only you play mahjong instead... I can't really fault anyone here though, it's a free-to-play franchise, and the similarities don't take away from the actual gameplay. I just felt I needed to point it out. *shrug*","May 20","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
