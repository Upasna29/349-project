"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aiggate/recommended/386930/","Aiggate","Aiggate","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Aiggate/","218 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nFor an early access game that just came out Dragonflight isn't too shabby. There isn't much in the game right now, but with the whole early access thing and the release being yesterday (at the time of writing this) that's to be expected.\n\nFor those of you who prefer to see the game you can watch the first level, which doubles as the tutorial, and a bit of lore as well. Otherwise skip down a bit and I'll try and give a bit of a Pros and Cons comparison.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wTZNM8TON0Q\n\nPros:\n-Looks: The game doesn't look half bad. Flying over one of the lakes in game looks especially great in my opinion. I've seen a number of games that have been out for much longer, early access and finished, that look worse than this. While there aren't many assests in the game, what has made it in looks quite nice in my opinion.\n-Controls: They actually seem to be well done when they work right as well as being something you can adjust easily (That being the sensitivity of the controls. As of now you can't actually rebind any of the keys), though they can be a bit wonky. I mainly use the mouse and keyboard though, so you may have better results if you use a game controller instead.\n- Story: Again, there isn't much here, but what is in gives you a decent understanding of the game world. Obviously this is something that will be worked on as the development continues, but it's nice that the devs gave us a bit to start out with instead of just some random levels.\n-Options: The game actually lets you choose some settings. Not too much yet, but the ability to change sensitivity is honestly a godsend when the controls start to act up.\n-Controller support: While I haven't used a game controller with this game yet, it does come fully supported. From some of what I've seen others do it's probably a more stable option as well. The mouse and keyboard, which do work fine, are probably going to need some fine tuning in the settings menu if you choose to play with them.\n-VR support: I don't have any type of VR headset to use so I can't say how well it works, but the option is there if you have the means and urge to test it out. A bit of a warning though, with how diving around and the flight mechanics work, you may want to pass on this if you get motion sick easily.\n-You're a dragon: I'm not really sure I have to say much here. You get to play around, fly, fight, and destroy things as a dragon. Even with the unfinished state this is a better dragon game then many others I've played before.\n\nCons:\n-Not much in the game: For those of you who just want to play and don't care much about the development. Right now the game has two levels, one being a tutorial and the other being an actual castle assault. Neither of them take much time. Now this will change as the game is worked on, and you really shouldn't expect too much from an Early Access game on this front, but for those who just want a game to run around in then you may want to wait a bit.\n-Sounds: As of now some of the sounds are much louder than any of the others. The opening menu, for example, has the dragon do a roar or two that's obnoxiously loud if you've got headphones on. Anyone planning on recording themselves play will need to equalize the sounds after recording if they want commentary as well.\n-Collisions: Defintely one of the more frustrating things right now. If your controls freak out for a second, or you have the bad luck to run into something (Or you got close enough and the game thinks you ran into something) then it might just kill you. In the game you take damage whenever you run into something. This wouldn't be too bad, except that the game tends to start flipping out when you do. Sometimes you can get lucky and it'll work itself out, other times you're probably just gonna die. Not the worst issue I've seen in an early access game, but still definitely a frustrating one.\n-Dragon combat: In the second level you have the option of fighting other dragons in the air. It may be easier with the joystick, but as of now it seems to need some fine tuning. It's still fairly enjoyable and not impossible by any stretch of the imagination, but some of the control kinks become a bit more obvious when you're trying to chase after another dragon or get them back in your sights.\n-Aiming: As of now it can be difficult to actually see where you're aiming when you attack something. When using your sustained breath attack it's not as bad as you can move it around to get an idea. However using your ranged attack can take a bit of practice before you can start reliably hitting anything, but more than likely you'll still just be hitting the general area you were aiming for rather than any actual spot.\n\nOverall I do recommend the game if you're okay with following the development process. The bits I've played I've enjoyed quite a bit and I'm definitely looking forward to any updates in the future. However, if you're hesitant to spend $15.99 USD on the game that's still got little in the way of things you can do I'd recommend following it or putting it on a wishlist to find easier. Wait for a few more updates or the game to go on sale and I'm sure you'll enjoy the game just as much as I do now.","September 1, 2015","true","2.2"," 34 of 38 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","34","38","0","0"

There are only a handful of other games that try to create a full-fledged dragon RPG (including destructible environment).\n\nSadly, though, this game... is not amazing. It has very flighty controls (pun intended), for one. I definitely recommend trying it with a controller of some sort, as when I tried the mouse controls, I ended up somehow wedged in a rock upside-down. I also got ever-so-slightly sick from the flipping, and I'm not even prone to that kind of thing! Anyway, just use a controller.\n\nThe graphics are decent, so nothing too horrific about that, except for the fact that you can't customize your dragon at all (insert sad face here).\n\nMy game also ended up crashed during the first "cutscene". The cutscenes consist of text and pictures, which, if done correctly, could be great, but in this case, I could never find out because the game kept crashing.\n\nI woud definitely recommend waiting a bit longer for changes to some things. It's a great concept, but requires a lot of time and resources to execute correctly and well. It IS definitely better than SOME triple A games though. And that's a genuine compliment.","January 28","false","0.2"," 24 of 35 people (69%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","69","24","35","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/melancholyrose/recommended/386930/","melancholyrose","Mel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/melancholyrose/","77 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nDragons? **** Yeah!\nOverviewI first reviewed this game when it was released in August of 2015 after having a blast with flying around and frying enemies. Over time, however... I feel somewhat disillusioned by the game. Not because it isn't a great concept and a great chance at a cool-as-hell game... but because nothing has been happening with it at all. In three months, I'll have owned this game for a year. A year with no real updates. I'm honestly a little let down.\n\nThe Positives1) The graphics are gorgeous. The animation of the wyvern... sorry, "dragon"... is very graceful. Much like you'd imagine a beast of the skies to appear. The way it glides and sails and flaps, it all makes the game very immersive and makes you feel like you ARE the dragon.\n\n2) The fire bombs used to blow stuff up is like a medicinal treatment to stress. When I play this game now, it's usually to release some tension, because destroying a huge hulk of a building with flames is so satisfying. Even more satisying is the huge "booooom!" sound effects when they crumble apart. You really feel like an unstoppable force.\n\n3) The fact that a fun little "blow stuff up" game has a story. Yeah, right now it's barely developed at all, but it does have one, and I'm curious to see how far it goes. And the fact that you take orders from this old wizard is pretty BA.\n\n4) The dragon's design, at least at this stage, is awesome.\n\nThe Negatives1) Those flight controls. I'm sorry, but they're god awful. I can't get over just how sickening they are to me. I can't play this game without crashing into rocks or the ground a few times each session, and when I do, the dragon gets spun upside down, and I become very disoriented. I can't figure out if I'm facing the sky, the ground, my own ♥♥♥... it's impossible. I'll actually become dizzy, and each playthrough session of Dragonflight, I feel nauseous and can no longer play. This is a huge setback for me, enough to where I don't want to play the game at all. Just thinking about all of that spinning and flipping is making me feel sick right now.\n\nIt's as though the devs made the game with controllers and VR in mind, but not those of us who use keyboards and mice for most of our games. Some have reported that controllers are better. Why should that be?\n\n2) There have been no developments in the near year I've owned this game. As I mentioned before, nothing has happened. They released some "god mode" version of the only available non-tutorial level, and that's it. This has kind of bothered me a little, since I had been looking forward to this game for so long, and paid for its early access. In close to a year... nothing. I want more dragons, more levels, more blowing stuff up. Oh, and I want the controls to not be a pile of garbage, if that's possible.\n\nBecause this game has been in early access for so long with no developments, I've sort of lost interest in playing it, because who wants to play the same level a million times? Not I.\n\n3) So... I'm supposed to destroy this huge castle thing to collect this dragon bone item. Gotcha. Okay, why is that so difficult? No one likes to admit that they failed. No one likes to admit that they're "the loser" of the group. But here, I fear no backlash when I say with honesty: I can't beat the Breaking the Covenant level. I've watched videos, I've read tutorials, I've tried as hard as I possibly can. Sometimes breaking that castle is easy... and other times it's almost impossible. I can't really say what I'm doing wrong, because I don't know. Maybe this can be related to a glitch, or a design flaw, or just that I really can't play this game without help, but it is a GIANT pain in the ♥♥♥ to complete the very first goal of the game that isn't a tutorial. I get that this is early access and there are flaws, but the game isn't very enjoyable to me anymore. As I said before, it's used only as stress relief when I want to blow things up as a massive flying lizard.\n\nFinal ThoughtsDragonflight has immense potential, I will give it that. It's a million times more playable than Red Letter Game's PoS title "Dragon: The Game", and that game's been out for almost three years. But there are other games out there that feature dragons that have much more content, and consistent content at that. Still, if you're a dragon-lover, I do actually recommend you check this out... as long as you don't get motion sickness. Then consider it high-risk.","September 6, 2015","true","3.1"," 12 of 15 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","12","15","0","0"

The flying is amazingly good, the animations are fluid, what little landscape there is looks nice, the in-game HUD is very nice and out of the way, while still conveying information. That being said though, there's only one actual level, one tutorial and a free-flight mode available in the beta, and I'm worried this game will be stuck in Early Access Purgatory forever unless they start adding a bit more to it.\n\nThey don't need to add much, there's no need for items and inventories and things like that, even just a couple of new chapters will be enough for now to keep the angry hordes satisfied.","April 5","true","6.1"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Overall, this game is pretty decent so far considering it's still in early access.\n\nIf you like the idea of flying around as a dragon firing at castles and other dragons to mess around, then I recommend you buy this game, if you are more for the content in the game(Quests/Chapters, etc.) then you might want to wait to see if they add more before buying(Check back once it's out of early access and see if they have added anything new).

Using a game controller, getting the dragon to fly straight is a bit easier.\n\nHowever, considering the game is focusing on flying as a dragon, sensitive controls are not a problem as they are technically part of the gameplay itself. I would only add that a reticle (even if optional) would be a nice addition, particularly when using the charged ranged attack.\n\nRegarding graphics, they are very smooth and visual quality as well as lighting are very good for an early-access game. No doubt later updates will come with even improved graphics. The game runs perfectly on my machine (Core i5, 4GB RAM, nVidia GeForce GTX 950M). There can be occasional frame rate drop in foggy areas, but I suppose it's because the game still comes with default settings (no video options menu), considering the development stage.\n\nThere are still some interaction issues, for instance, when hitting the ground or a wall, or when flying into other dragons as those collisions/interactions still lack some realism (again, since the game is still in an early stage, such things are expected, so, not really issues).\n\nNow, I'm really looking forward to seeing what's planned next about the storyline. There's really much potential here for a game combining a good background and nice gameplay mechanics!\nThe current version is very short and consists mostly in an introduction to the game, but again, one may expect increasing life duration with future releases.","May 11","true","1.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

So keep in mind that some cases wont be the same in the final build. I just play the game as anyone would without knowing what features it has, so i am terribly sorry if i missed some of them.\n\n\n\nThe story(i am sorry if i have this wrong):\n\nThe story is quite original for a dragon game at least, I only found it a little bit confusing but thats just my opinion. I wont go into details but its about gods that create a dragon and the dragon begins to attack the gods but the gods cant undo the dragon so they fought back together. In the playable chapters you will see that also demon-dragons(i think they are named Balqons) will come from the undergounds and an mage summons a dragon(you) to retrieve special bones(forgot name) from a big castle before the demon-dragons do\n\n\nThe Gameplay\n\nIt was really hard to get used to the conrtols at first but thanks to the great turtorial i could handle it. But still, the dragon was sometimes hard to control and in chapter 2 while fighting dragons, i never knew if i was going up or down. It is really hard to chase enemy dragons because they can also make sudden movements. Sometimes i even dont know where they are anymore until i see them breath random fire in the distance. Castles can also be a problem because the arrows deal allot of damage to you. You can take them out by destroying the tower and i hope they will add humans on the towers just to give it some more realism however taking out castles is really hard. You cant almost come trough the arrow rain without making weird movements. Other than that it actually does give you a feeling of being a dragon. The movements of the dragons are beautifully done and the sounds to. The fire does look great and it is fun to fly around. Also are the castles fully destructable.\n\n\nGraphics:\n\nGround, castles and dragons all look really detailed. That it also one of the main reasons flying as the dragon is fun.\n\n\nOptimized?:\n\nYes. I dind see lag or a sudden frame drop, evrything runs smooth as it should.\n\n\nGame breaking bugs?:\n\nThe only ''bug'' i saw was clipping trough buildings/mountains/ground when you die or fly straight into it. But thats probarly one of the main things that is going to be fixed. oh and that you can still breath fire when you are dead.\n\n\nWorth a buy?\n\nI have great hopes for this game. The developers are open to critism and love feedback. The game is just released and it already looks promissing.

I absolutely love that game, especially parts where I had to fly on the back of my dragon, Arokh. It was simply awesome. Drakan had the best dragon flying mechanics.\n\nUntil now.\n\nWhen I first entered the Dragonflight world, I crashed into a mountain with no ability to move. Next attempt was even worse: I was flying like a drunk bumblebee, swinging from side to side and crashing into objects. It took a bit of practise and changing mouse sensitivity, but finally flying as a fearsome dragon started to give me the satisfaction. And there was a lot of it. There still is. I absolutely love flying in this game.\n\nFor now, it's just a tutorial and one (pretty hard) level, but even if it stays that way, I'm going to love Dragonflight. But devs, don't get lazy.

You can indeed fly and fight with other dragons, and destroy a castle - and that is where the playable game stops and we hope the develpers continue to deliver (which they are so far).\n\nFor Occulus Rift owners, the experience is amazing, and hopefully will get better as the game progresses.  There is still work to be done the physics etc - but the is pre-alpha so no surprises there.  There are only two levels, one that just allows you to fly, and the other to fly and fight.\n\nIf the developers continue on their current trajectory, and deliver what they have planned, this game will be a hit.","September 26, 2015","true","1.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But from what I've seen it is definitely worth your buy. The Lore seems to be building up to an interesting story, and it captures the awesome feeling of being a giant fire-breathing dragon pretty well. I made sure to buy it early despite lack of features because I know this will turn out well and want to support the developers. I haven't played it too long, but I'd like to share my thoughts on the mechanics of the game itself. I'm on a Mac, not using VR, and my controls are keyboard and mouse.\n\nWhat I'd like to see as core gameplay improvements:\n-Slightly more responsive controls for up/down turning with the mouse. It feels a bit slow even with high sensitivity.\n-Sound for basic firebreathing sometimes doesn't turn on properly, or turns on late.\n-An optional, minimal, and fittingly designed targetting crosshair or some other system of aim assistance for the long-range attacks. It was hard to guess where my shots would land, and some although I did pick it up, it still seemed a bit difficult.\n-A wider variety of mechanics for the game. Having the same two attacks, and maybe some melee attacks, for the entire game would be fairly dull, even with an interesting story.\nI might add more to my review as this game improves. Feedback is important and I want to do all I can to help.\n\nOverall, I see a lot of potential for this. The feeling of swooping down and burning things was amazing. And during the first siege, dodging arrows and flying up to blow up a castle, I felt exhilarated. I felt like I was in Dragonheart, as the dragon. Amazing.\n\nI actually met and talked to one of the developers, Michael Conelly, at a VFX presentation yesterday. He's a very nice person and I was very inspired by his story. He certainly gave me some tips that will last throughout my search for a career. On a personal note, I hope you guys do well in developing this game. Good luck!","November 15, 2015","true","1.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For an early access game, this has great graphics, awsome lore, and makes you almost feel like you are the dragon.\n\nHowever these are my issues:\n1. The dragon's colors seem quite bland, its all just a green-grey.\n2. The Balcons can lock me into a descending fight, in which i can do nothing but my firebreath which seems to do nothing.\n3. While the flying animation is excellent, its hard to control. I have mine on the lowest sensitivity but it's still difficult.\n\nHere are some recommendations:\n1. Instead of having a set color for the good dragon, allow the players to dye the dragon as they wish\n2. If you add new "breeds" of dragons, then try adding an unique ability for each, or something of that sort.\n3. Please allow the ability to land! It frustrates me everytime i touch the earth to have continuous damage dealt to me.\n\nThank you for taking time to read this, and please consider these suggestions.","May 28","true","3.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ITInsane/recommended/386930/","ITInsane","Insane-Randomness","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ITInsane/","31 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nThis will be my first ever review on steam.  Keep that in mind.\n\nI love dragons.  Also keep that in mind.\n\nI just bought this game today, and have only played it for around 30 minutes.  That is enough to get through the tutorial and play the first actual mission.  Do not expect to be the unstoppable hell machine that a dragon should be.  There are other enemy dragons, and there are many flaming arrows and exploding catapult charges.  As it is right now, this game could do with two actual things.  A difficulty modifier, and a free flight mode.  Please put a free flight mode in.\n\nEven more so though, this game has the incredible potential to be the most epic thing to come out of steam.  As it is right now, I would call it a playable demo that you have to pay full price for.  It takes thirty minutes to play the game through it's entirety right now.  Therefore if you don't like it, you can get a refund.\n\nControls are iffy, but if you use a gamepad (don't use the mouse and keyboard), then it is most excellent.  The difficulty comes in aiming your fire breath attacks.  We could really do with ye-olde crosshair.  The joystick, with the sensitivity turned up after you get the hang of the tutorial, is truely joyous to use.  Before you know it you'll be doing swooping flame spewing straffing runs on citadels.\n\nGraphics as is right now are ACCEPTABLE.  We could also really use a fog reduction at higher altitude, so as to see the ground.  However, there were times soaring over lakes that I thought, "Actually this game is rather beautiful.  Sometimes."\n\nThe real problems comes in the difficulty.  On the second mission, it is an almost necessity to have the sensitivity turned up for dragon-on-dragon combat.  It also aids air-to-ground combat.  You have to learn to use your mobility to evade the majority of attacks.  For a first actual combat level, I feel it's a bit too intense and large scale to work.  There are far too many enemies, all of which take several successful attacks to take down.  The ranged attack might even need a homing buff to be able to use effectively in the air.\n\nAs a pre-alpha game, for me, this is so worth it.  I'm a bit nervous about the eventual dirrection this game will take, as I think it would be far better as an open-world RPG a-la Skyrim, but with a much much bigger game world.  I'd like to see factions and multiple cities, and the ability to take part in seiges with multiple dragons and armies of humans on either side and...\n\nYeah.  I'd pay a million dollars for that game.  I'd give my car, my job, just to have that game.  I just don't think, with such a great premise, that just making chapters is a good direction.  With that, all it is is combat combat combat.  And after the 10th level or so, it gets a little old.\n\nI'd recommend this game for anyone who loves dragons anywhere close to what I do.  I'd also recommend it for those of you who love flying, or for those of you who love a great idea in the making.  For those of you who want value for your money, perhaps wait till it comes out of early access.\n\nAll in all a very well polished little piece of epicness for 17$.","March 19","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fighting is also an issue, and it is unclear to me where the intended aim is for the fireballs and fire breath.
