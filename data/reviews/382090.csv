A new horror game...made on the Unity engine...which is not only really good, but really, really SCARY!  I, for one, am gobsmacked.  Great graphics, INCREDIBLE sound...though I'm not 100% sold on the rogue-like or permadeath elements, especially with a 50/50 chance of returning to THE START OF THE GAME if you just happen to choose the "wrong door" in Limbo-land after you "die"; and the fact that you'll sometimes spawn right near the power switch to the Exit elevator, and other times several MILES away...sigh.  But it still works...mostly...\n\nSo okay, there's isn't that much "story" per se - though the "recurring nightmares" premise is always a nice one - but it's pretty clear on the whole that this game is pig-headedly dedicated to the cause of SPOOKING THE LIVING ♥♥♥♥ out of you, and that surely can't be a bad thing for the "horror" genre.  An almost relentlessly oppressive atmosphere, genuinely effective jump-scares, tension aplenty...this game, if nothing else, certainly has all of those.  It also has quite a bit of repetition...especially if you keep dying (and somehow living, in spite of the aforementioned door thing), and have to keep redoing levels over and over again (procedural generation be damned, it's still much of a muchness to me).  But even if you don't have the patience to ever "beat" the game, you can be confident that even a few aimless hours spent exploring THESE dungeons will surely put the slick into your slacks.\n\nSure, it all does seem a tad tawdry and b-grade around the edges, even with the rather spiffy production values, but you can rest assured that it's mostly in a GOOD way.  We horror fans are beggars at best, so how choosy do you wanna be?  Nine bucks isn't asking much for a full colonic irrigation, is it now?  And it's not like there isn't a significant sale on Steam every four to six days anyway, right?  Buy it, and support some dev with a stupidly cute name and sickeningly adorable avatar in their noble pursuit to give us all the heeby-jeebies.  With a bit of luck they might even make a Dungeon Nightmares 3 and give us a NON-ROGUE, NON-PERMADEATH game which doesn't lower itself to throwing insanely cheap deaths at you by the last couple of levels.\n\nYeah, right...keep dreamin', RJ...\n\nVerdict: 9/10.","December 7, 2015","true","3.1"," 28 of 31 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","28","31","8","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/logankagato/recommended/382090/","logankagato","Kagato","http://steamcommunity.com/id/logankagato/","31 products in account","This is the scariest game I have ever played.I've played Silent Hill, Fatal Frame, Resident Evil, Amnesia, and several other horror games. I am a Horror game junkie, and this game blew me away with it's scares. It provides a perfect blend of subtle terror, atmosphere, clever jumpscares and lurking scares, and brilliant sound design and visual design. This is some P.T.-level horror.\n\nHowever, the gameplay is not perfect. I feel the game suffers from being a little too dark with not enough candles. You can strike a quick light to see your way (which can also provide some great hallucination scares) or simply use your map. It just gets difficult when trying to spot a chest, newspaper, or power switch,\n\nThe omly true frustrating moments in the gameplay are the time-restricted floors (10 minutes is very unforgiving and relies heavily on luck) as well as the permadeath mechanic. I managed to somehow, some way, cheat death 7 times before succumbing to Permadeath, but it is a very terrible feeling to reach so far into the game, which is decently long at around 7 hours on average, only to lose everything and start over at the beginning based on essentially a coin-flip 50/50 chance of continuing or game over.\n\nThe good news is, there are no cheap deaths except during the final two dungeons. I found myself killed twice by something that I didn't even see without warning, but it may have been my own fault because up until that point, no death was cheap or instant.\n\nMinor personal gripes from me are towards the Hotel area itself. There was one moment that absolutely terrified me regarding the lights. However, this didn't last and would have made for some absolutely fantastic horror in the otherwise 'safe' environment. More of that would have been great, but sadly there wasn't much after that other than a few sounds here or there.\n\nOverall, as a horror game, this is one of the scariest ones out there and for me to fully fear going anywhere or doing anything in this game because I'm afraid of what's hiding in the darkness is truly an amazing feat to do. I'd say just rebalance and clean up the actual gameplay a little bit and you've got a real winner. I hope to see a Dungeon Nightmares 3. I will most certainly LP that one too!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxVXR3n1woE","October 19, 2015","true","5.9"," 17 of 21 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","17","21","0","0"

When launching the game from steam, the game always crashes. What I did to fix this, is find the game in the folder and run as admin. So, go to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Dungeon Nightmares II - The Memory. Right click, run as admin, and now you can play the game!! However, playing this way doesn't log hours in steam!!!\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dCY_e8K6GJA&list=PLKMxTuqznyPMEEl1TkR0hTuGwklyApuvO&index=1\n\nNow to the actually game. I've put in more than .2 hours, but as I said, steam doesn't log the hours currently. But the game is great so far. The atmosphere is tense, and the jump scares are plenty. If you enjoyed the game vanish, you'll definitely enjoy this! Many horror games struggle with jump scares, sometimes they're poorly executed, or there's just too many of them. But this game does a perfect job of balancing them, and building an environment that's terrifying even without the jump scares. The permadeath is horrible though, it doesn't add to the scare factor as much as it adds to pure annoyance. Having some sort of checkpoint system would be nice.

Sounds scary enough? Yep, I also shake everytime I see the logo at the start. Apart from that it's a decent randomized story about a woman who suddenly got lost in a nightmarish maze of copy-paste elements and merciless triggers under her hotel. She probably woke up from a bad dream in her room and decided to go check in the basement for the continuation.. or vice versa. Anyway, she's trapped in that empty old building with rusty elevators, clanging chains and pixellated cobwebs. There we also 100% encounter missing girl's portraits, used torture instruments, sceleton parts, mouldy books etc. She can't run or duck, but she can light the unnecessary candles if you find some and interact with objects. The game's not bad, the random architecture, strange letters and realistic sound effects keep the intrigue alive. Remember, you totally don't have to feel scared until the trigger works, but certainly no one shall stop you if you want to! Also, to shut a screamer up I just shout some obscene words at the monitor twice as loud, this helps a lot! Have fun!\n\nЕще один ужас от первого лица на двигле Единство. Звучит достаточно страшно? Я тоже трясусь каждый раз, как вижу этот логотип при запуске. В остальном это неплохая случайно генерируемая история про женщину, которая внезапно потерялась в жутком лабиринте размноженных под копирку элементов и беспощадных спусковых крючков под ее гостиницей. Она, видимо, проснулась от дурного сна в своей комнате и решила сходить проверить в подвале насчет продолжения... или наоборот. В любом случае, она поймана в этом пустом старом здании с ржавыми лифтами, звенящими цепями и пикселизованными паутинами. Также мы стопудово встретим портреты пропавшей девочки, б/у пыточный инструментарий, части скелетов, плесневелые книжки и пр. Она не может бегать и приседать, но умеет зажигать бесполезные свечи, если удастся их найти, и взаимодействовать с объектами. Игра не плоха, случайная архитектура, странные письма и реалистичные звуки поддерживают интригу. Только помните, что совсем не обязательно бояться, пока не сработает спусковой механизм, но если хотите, то никто не собирается мешать! Также, чтобы заткнуть крикуна, я просто матерюсь в экран вдвое громче него, это здорово помогает!

It is due to the fact that this game is not script heavy making every moment a constant suspension. Also, the graphic and atmosphere are perfect.

I still recommend this game since it's a good horror game if you enjoy jump scares, which some will bash out of the wall and kill you.\n\nPros:\n*Creepy atmosphere - voices whispering, odd sounds, and the shaking of the screen kept me on my seat.\n*Actual enemies - There are actual enemies that WILL bash through a wall to chase you down. Run!\n*The randomization of the dungeon - helps when you get stuck and keeps things interesting to explore a new maze.\n\nCons:\n*Repetitive - explore new maze to find a new key to a new hotel room. It gets old after a while to the edge of boring.\n*glitches - I found one glitch where if I alt-tab out it will exit my game where I will have to reboot it up again.\n*No pause? - not sure if this is a glitch or just me, but when I tried pressing start the background jumpscares continued.\n\nThat's my opinion so far of this game, and I'll probably add more when I do more playing. It's a decent game, not the best out there, but decent nonetheless.","December 22, 2015","true","4.0"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","7","7","2","0"

There are a few cheap deaths that are not really foreseeable, yet you may find your way through most of the game only to die to something you couldn't see coming in the final night. Then you have to pass a coin flip to have your progress save, so you don't have to redo all the prior nights. Needless to say, repeating segments you have already done, encountering the same scares and sounds multiple times due to a cheap death, glitched of gimmicky, causes all the horror to go right out the window.\n\nOn the topic of glitching, the game is rather buggy. Half a dozen+ times I had to repeat the floor I was on because I fell through the ground. This wouldn't be a huge problem if it wasn't for the fact that later nights become windy labyrinths with extreme amounts of backtracking involved.\n\nIf you want a terrifying experience, well, none will be more terrifying the first time you go through it than Dungeon Nightmares II. However, should you find yourself towards the end of the game, only to die to some cheap "gotchya" kill that you can't really foresee, you may be understandably annoyed as I was. And then on replaying the game, may find it to be less enticing or interesting, and more just an exercise in futility. If you're ok with that, then this is your game. But if you are not interested in a horror experience that will go from terrifying to grueling as the time goes on, than you may want to take your money elsewhere.","January 13","false","4.9"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","8","11","0","0"

I also try to see the product for what it is rather than what would make the game better (the - "what-ifs") as those comments should be left in the feedback section of any forum.\n\nSimply put - I Won't take 1 point off my review on a product just because it is missing; say for example graphics bug, or in this game for instance you only get very few candles that don't last too long).. These things don't affect my review on games because the game developers can fix these things when customers give feedback and suggestions..\n\nSo I will be doing my review based on 1 simple criteria. Rating the game for "What it is" rather than "what it could or should be".\n\nOn to the review-rating....\n\nI first played this game on Android "Dungeon Nightmares" and i was blown away by the pretty much everything.\n\nThe detail, the suspense, sound effects etc..\n\nThen i came across Dungeon Nightmare II : The Memory on PC -Steam- and thought to myself, "I MUST HAVE THIS GAME, IT HAS TO BE GOOD".\n\nSo without any hesitation at all I purchased this game on steam and Immediately started to play it briefly. Mainly just to test out the gameplay, graphics, and the whole Suspense and build-up for random screen flashes and things running toward you and disappearing..\n\nI'll tell you one thing for certain, I was not disappointed and I was glad i made the choice to purchase this game..\n\nI like the fact you can find hidden walls and break them down, I love the extreme amount of detail that has gone in to making everything look realistic. The more realistic it looks, the more intense everything feels. ( I love to play these games in the dark, with the sound up) ***BIG GRIN**.\n\nThis game gave me constant goosebumps which is another sign of the awesome intense feel of the game.\n\nI don't like to spoil the game for other people so i leave my reviews of games to a minimum amount of spoilers (if any) but try to be informative and detailed about the game's quality as it is..\n\nAnd if you're crazy about the Horror genre like i am and love those intense and immersive games that can potentionally make you jump out of your seat, then i HIGHLY recommend this game to you.\n\nRating 9.0/10\n\nA brilliant & uniquely immersive and intense game..","October 15, 2015","true","1.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

However, I try to find the ones that stand out and are worth a gamers time. This is one. This little gem is tucked away, hidden deep within Steam. It has less than 50 reviews at this time, which for Steam is pretty low for a game that has been out for several months. This game deserves your attention. It has 100% procedurally-generated maps, an AI that appears to be really good and learns from your behaviors and evolves, Permadeath, a fantastically creepy atmosphere and of course, that combat-free gameplay that leaves you feeling SO helpless against your struggles! This game even has some controller support. I really liked the atmosphere of this one a lot. It was easy to get lost once you turned the lights off and threw the headphones on. It relies much more on the atmosphere then it does actual "jump scares' and the tediousness of the randomized dungeons add to your despair. Do not miss this hidden gem on Steam. You can grab it for $9 ($4.50 during the Sale!!!) and it is totally worth it. 4/5 and glad I found this one.\n\nHappy Gaming!","December 27, 2015","true","0.9"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's just your statistic.\nThere is a mouse senstivity.\n\nAbout the game.\nYou are lurking around the dungeon to find some clues and collect them before you are able to leave a dungeon.\nThen you are waking up at the hotel and from there you basically start the new dungeon again. The game is randomized with perma-deaths. Game is extremely dark and it's very difficult to see. However you have a map so you will not get lost and you know which locations are still unrevealed. The only thing what i didnt like about the game is the ammount of jumpscares. Which are random even too. The game has traps, lores and alot of loud sound. Which you can only turn lower at your speaker volume. The only thing what you have is a spark of light and sometimes candles.\n\nHas lame Jumpscares.\nAtmosphere is okay.\nToo dark.\nRandomized.\nHas some kind of a story.\n\nOther things.\nI don't really like jumpscares.. Using jumpscares into a game is the cheapest thing to call it a "horror" genre.\n\nDeveloper has thumps this review down which is decreasing the score points to 3.\n\n-------------------\n\nI Give this game a 3/10","April 19","false","6.2"," 7 of 13 people (54%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","54","7","13","2","0"

My old pal Charlie the Skeleton is up to his old tricks too, chasing us when we don't pay him enough attention.\n\nAnyways I highly recommend this game to any horror fan out there......what are you waiting for? go get it :)\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frM0CoQ-f_Q","September 14, 2015","true","2.1"," 23 of 57 people (40%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","40","23","57","6","4"

Virtually unplayable.\n\nTo simplify why you shouldn't play this game:\n\n1. The game is very laggy at the "fastest" setting with no way to improve responsiveness that you can feel in the game.\n2. The graphics quality from the highest setting to the lowest is virtually the same, and at best the game looks like a mid-tier title from 15 to 20 years ago. That's not an exaggeration, nor is there anything retro about the design. The graphics are just horrible.\n3. Bad graphics and slow responsiveness are combined with picking up small items that require you to stand at the exact place and click the exact pixel unlike interacting with other items.\n4. The level design is awful and very cramped. Desks and bookshelves are so proportionally huge that they almost block every hallway. I understand strange things can happen in survival horror games, but out of proportion items that prohibit a player from walking to point A to point B are a hallmark of bad level design.\n5. The audio is absolutely awful. The soundtrack is the cliched heartbeat, and the sound of your footsteps is quickly annoying. The sound of your feet will awkwardly cut in with that low-quality-at-a-higher-volume static, and it's just a 3 second loop. You don't hear your footsteps; you hear an old sound file from the 90's of footsteps.\n\nThis really feels like a poorly designed game from the late 90's. The level design is horrible, the audio is horrible, the graphics are horrible, and the controls are horrible. This is the first time on Steam where I have felt scammed buying a game. It feels like someone took a budget title they found at the dollar store back  in the 90's and repackaged it with the help of the Unity game design suite. You wouldn't play this game for free, let alone pay for it. I really feel ripped off.\n\nIf you want to struggle trying to walk down hallways because the furniture is too big just to struggle picking up a candle while muting the low quality sound loops of heartbeats and footsteps, this is the game for you. Otherwise, don't make the mistake I made and get scammed looking for something new in the survival horror genre.","September 29, 2015","false","0.2"," 8 of 33 people (24%) found this review helpful","24","8","33","0","0"

The only functions that work are the view functions and the "c" key.  I am unable to move my character off the platform using the "w,a,s,d" keys.  I have even adjusted the key assignments in"input" prior to running the game.  Please help, this is very frustrating.","September 19, 2015","true","3.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
