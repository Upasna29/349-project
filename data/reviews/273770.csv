Nothing is laid out with menus, its all places and locations. You have a university, office plaza, media plaza and your home (which seems pointless). In these locations they are like city streets, you need to scroll your mouse left and right and click on doors. One click will have your player character enter, two clicks will automatically enter. When inside a building, you see a room and need to find what you want to do. It makes the controls needlessly cumbersome. To see how many copies you have in stock, you need to go across town. To see your finances, you need to go back across town. It is crazy.\n\nThe game is very click base as if it could be a mobile game, you won't find hot keys or even menus. Right mouse clicking exits you out of an area. Stats and charts need to be found in rooms and areas. Even then, there's no depth. There is no way to see how well games are selling, you just need to hope they sell well that month at the price you've set. You can visit a university magazine stand to find out the most popular games and genres for $4 each time. You can visit a game store in the media plaza to see where your games rank. You can visit an advertising executive to publicize your games, your company and see how you stack compared to the two other companies you're competing against. You can even visit a banker, take out a loan, buy and sell stocks of your company and the other three. Those are nice features, but when you visit the banker and executive, you need to talk with them. Click something to say and listen for them to say it before you can continue. If you dare click on something else it could cause a glitch that will loop the speech if not crash a menu 10 seconds later. It is stunning.\n\nWhen you play, there is no hand holding. I needed to figure out to visit my office, create a game engine (or license one), then click and drag the 'print out' into my inventory. Then go next door to the development office? Once there, I need to click and drag the 'print out' into the project list. After that, since I had no employees, I had to go to the university and figure out that I needed to click a bulletin board in order to find employees. The hiring system is nice, it shows you the quality in stars, and their tempo to complete the job. You hire programmers, artists and composers. Some you can hire and others that are independent. So they can get better jobs and come back to you when you need them most, but they don't get paid when they're not working. Then its back to the development studio with my employees. I need to click the project, then assign programmers to the engine and click start project.\n\nAfter you wait a few in game days, weeks or months, its time to take that game engine project, click and drag it back into your inventory, then go next door to your office and make a new game after clicking and dragging the engine into the proper position. Creating a new game project is easy. You'll get to chose things like what languages and what platforms. By platforms I mean, PC, arcade and console. There are no specific consoles. Just those three. Then when that is all 'printed out,' its back over to next door to click and drag the 'print out' from my inventory into the project window. Once there, I need to click on the project, then sift through my employees to assign programmers, artists and composers. The more people I have working, the faster they'll get done. The higher quality they are, the better the game.\n\nFrom there, you don't just release the game. Once you click and drag the finished project into your inventory of course. Its off to the manufacturing facility where you click on the design table to include everything that will come with your game. By design, I mean pack the box with stuff and raise the manufacturing cost. Shirts, buttons, stickers, black and white instruction manuals, color instructions, an insert. Its all up to you! With some click and dragging. With that done you'll visit the manufacturing machine that will churn out the copies of your game. The more copies, the cheaper they become to manufacture. Click and drag the finished product into the machine. Then start manufacturing! After a few game days, all of the copies will arrive.\n\nDo they just sell themselves? Nope. Time to find a publisher! So you need to visit a publisher's office and select a publishing deal from books on the wall. They all have minimum quality ratings, so your 45% quality game can't be published with a 53% quality deal. There is a punishment for failing to release the game by the allowed time and for your trouble of making a game, you'll get 6% of the profits depending on the deal. Some deals are far better than others.\n\nAfter that, its back to the factory that has your copies. You need to click on the pallet with the finished copies and click and drag your publishing deal from your inventory into the game's slot and flip the checkmark switch to officially release it! Wasn't that easy? No hand holding at all!\n\nOf course 5 hours into the game, I finally discovered the tutorial was in the campaign, but wasn't marked as a 'tutorial.' I thought it was just another scenario in the campaign. The tutorial explains what to do, but it gets caught on itself and could explain things better, such as flipping through a gaming magazine had me clicking all over before I figured out to click a game title. The voice over will talk over other voice overs. Not just that, but if you go to a different location than you should be in, the tutorial narration will tell you what to do as if you're in the correct place, instead of saying no this is the office, go to the university.\n\nAs soon as you get the hang of the 1,000 step process, it becomes an insane juggle of going between locations since there is no menu. Waiting to pan the street to the right or left. Waiting for your character to walk to the building before you realize double clicking enters the door instantly. Even though there's a game speed, that doesn't speed up the character. It doesn't speed up every time I need to hear 'I would like a bank loan,' then hear the banker's rebuttal.\n\nThere are visual errors here like text not disappearing when the dialog boxes do. Text overlapping out of windows. Sometimes the ticker PDA doesn't show anything when it should have a message. The PDA (ticker) is nice, it pops up useless information like you need to pay $3,000 for golf clubs or you're having a bad hair day. Its all random things that might as well be Chance cards from Monopoly. The PDA pop up changes the game from fast to slow, which is good, but the problem is that a lot of what the PDA shows is useless moments to make you laugh. You didn't sleep well, because your bed broke. Stealing MP3s is bad. Visit the gametycoon website. Your employees will get sick and will be unable to work for 12 days.\n\nThe only way to get a game over is if you go into debt for more than 90 days. You can get loans and sell stock to stay a float, but even on normal, it seems difficult. Your games only make money at the start of every month. You have full control over the price of your games at the factory, but to put publicity into the games, you need to go to a different area down the street.\n\nThe game itself is difficult even on normal. Luckily there is an easy mode. To top everything off, it has crashed or permafroze a few times, so you'll need to keep saving frequently, since there is no auto save feature. With all of that being said, there are some interesting elements in the game, but the juggle and struggle of going location to location over and over again is unfun and begging people to not play it. If only there was a menu and no traveling. The time it takes to hear people talk is just too long with no way to skip it.","October 28, 2014","false","5.9"," 262 of 269 people (97%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","97","262","269","9","0"

Upon starting the game, you are given a choice of three avatars to choose from, with no customisation whatsoever. After this sequence, and some terrible wooden voice-acting, you are whisked away to a street where you are told to make your avatar walk painfully slowly to your office. And no, there is no way to speed this up.\n\nThe game tells you to create a game engine, then gives you almost no advice on how to do so, which leads to lot of trial-and-error clicking in the laughably rough looking interface which looks like something knocked together in 30 seconds on Photoshop. You are then told to walk down the street to the bank, where you borrow money (ask for whatever you like, and the clerk simply hands it over), and then it's off to the "university" to hire some staff (in reality just a hanging noticeboard where you click on people's names). Returning to your office, you click once more through the interface to assign your newly hired staff to work on your engine project. You then wait...and wait...and wait. Turns out that there's no way to speed this up, and there's nothing else to do but stare at the inside of your blocky 3D office.\n\nAt this point, I turned the game off, so I don't know if your hardworking crew eer do finish working on that engine in order for you to start working on your game proper. The final irony is that a game supposedly all about making your own games is a terrible game in itself with no thought for it's audience. Who were they aiming for with this game? Game makers themselves? Masochists? Poor saps not realising that they'd bought the wrong game with a similar sounding title and not realising it until it was too late?\n\nOn top of its aforementioned problems, there are other glaring flaws; screens untranslated from their original German, and some garbled English phrases that look like they've been through the wringer that is Google Translate. It feels like a game that not only isn't finished, but that's been slapped together with little care or thought, leaving an absolute travesty of a game that should not have been released.\n\nI don't normally write reviews, but this one inspired me to do so. I got the game for free, and actually earned money by selling the steam cards I got for playing it, and I still feel ripped off. Do not pay any money for this "game".","January 21, 2015","false","1.7"," 140 of 150 people (93%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","93","140","150","12","5"

For instance walking my character to one office to print a design for an engine, then going to the production office to place the design on the project board could have been just one click of a button.\n\nThere is no way to skip to the end of a project while it is in production and the player is forced to sit and watch a clock at it ticks away.\n\nI never judge a game based on graphics or sound, unless of course one of these features does not work properly. During the tutorial a man's voice tells you what to do, but even when you are doing what he is telling you to do he repeats what he said. This does not stop his previous sound file, but instead doubles over it and explodes your ears if you are using headphones. Also while in the game manufacturing place the mans voice is completely drowned out by annoyingly loud industrial sounds. I'm fairly certain there is only one voice actor that does the voice of every single character.\n\nThis is not an exaggeration; this game seriously gave me a headache five minutes into it.","October 29, 2014","false","2.3"," 87 of 87 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","87","87","4","0"

There are some really basic "generic flaws" and then there are the "content flaws".\nFor the generic flaws the controls are pretty counter-intuitive (Escape always takes you to the main meny, right mouse click escapes from the screen), there is no pause option! For me pause is an important option, I mean even if it wasn't....\nThe contrast in sounds is horrible, when playing the tutorial you will barely be able to hear the person explain the game due to the background sounds (also the voiceacting is just horrible, I would have rather had no voiceacting at all), besides that the tutorial is just horrendous and not user friendly at all. Also, every notification slows your game down, so when it feels the need to tell me kids threw stuff at my house or that my competitors made a new game it slows my game down again, this is really tedious as the messages are irrelevant to me!\n\nNow the obvious lackluster, depth, there is nothing to be gained here, you can't train your people, you can't invest in anything. The only thing you do is wait and watch the boards while you again click on a "genre & language(s)" to create the concept for you new game. As time progresses you get new technology available but not through any effort of yourself.\nThen there is another thing, I need to take a publisher contract to push my games to stores, but for some weird reason I have to print my own discs and keep track of that stock! That is NOT gamedevelopment, that is what the publishers are supposed to do for me.\n\nThere is another game like this available on Steam which just blows this title away, I was dumb enough to think this was the sequel, save your money, buy the other title!","February 12, 2014","false","2.5"," 77 of 80 people (96%) found this review helpful","96","77","80","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodravensid/recommended/273770/","bloodravensid","Blood Ravens - AWAY","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bloodravensid/","926 products in account","Gameplay PremiseThe premise of the gameplay is simple. To be the best game tycoon. This is a simulator game, so some semblance to the facts are expected.\n\nTutorialThe tutorial is spoken, there is no subtitle, and there is no explanation on what should be done. For example : You are told to borrow $100k from the bank, but you are not told where the bank is and how to even sign the paper. You are told to manage your developer, and you are not told where is your developer office (turns out, the development office is separate from your personal office). In short, the tutorial is not helpful at all.\n\nThe UIThe UI is very bad. There is no tooltips at all. If you hover over something, there won't be any explanation. As UI is related to how information is given out to you, this game is also very bad at that. To access your game quality, you have to go to a certain object. To access your sales number, you have to click on some paper on your table. To access your financial report, you have to click on another paper on your table. There is no collated financial reports, no collated engine/game reports. Some reports have to be accessed outside your personal office, which you must travel to other place just to get a piece of report.\n\nThe notion of personal office looks like Airline Tycoon Deluxe, which are a great game. In Airline Tycoon, there are tooltips so that we know what we are going to click. To access the incoming message, just click on the paper organizer in your office. To access your plane facilities, click on the plane model. To access the fuel price and setting, click on the fuel painting on the wall. To access your route, click on the globe. To access your financial report, just a click away. This is very different with Game Tycoon 1.5.\n\nGame Tycoon 1.5 fails to present the information needed with a good manner, information is fragmented. For tycoon games failure to present information is very bad, as those information are the key to success in these kind of games.\n\nThe GameplayThe gameplay is horrid.\n\nThere are no clear explanation.\nWhat is the differences between Keyboard controller and Joystick? Japanese language and English language? No explanation at all.\n\nThe game is too complex.\nNot complex in a good manner. To build a game, you have to create an engine. During the creation of engine, you have to enter the features (like Game Dev Tycoon) though it's unclear which features is better than the others. During the creation of engine you are also able to set how many developers are going to develop the engine. Next, you have to print it and it is stored at your inventory. After that, you have to go to the university, and grab some developers.\n\nAfter that, you have to go to the developers office (beside your office, they have darts targeting your character) and assign programmers to the project. No problem on this part.\nAfter that, you develop the game, same thing, you have the game "cassette" on your inventory. Then, you have to go to design factory to define how much gimmicks you wanted. Then you go to factory to print out your product. Then to licensing to find a publisher. Then to factory again to sell the game.\n\nThe process is believable, but presented in such clunky manner that you will be confused in no time. While a good game will present all of those above steps in a UI that have drop-down menus, this game is not. As outlined above, because information is too fragmented. For example : After printing out your product, you go to publisher. The publisher demands your game have a specific rating. If you have printed your game, you can't know the rating anymore, the rating is known only after the game is developed. These kind of thing is very bad, information should be able to be accessed at all times!\n\nNo feedback\nWhile the Game Dev Tycoon provides feedback to the player by giving out review scores, this game did not give any. Review scores are important to give us facts how good is our product. But no dice, no feedback, no nothing. In tycoon games it is important to have feedback. For example, if we are told that our sales drop in such areas, we should know the cause. Bad product? Bad pricing? Bad sales? We must have information. This game lacks those, so the players could not make informed decisions to make something.\n\nBad Game Structure\nNo menus. Simply horrid. You can't access functions inside the game, you have to go out to main menu to get that. You can't go to settings, you have to go to main menu to access settings. Not to mention that the game will drop to desktop for a few second if you go to main menu. That is simply unacceptable.\n\nLook and FeelSimply lacking. The game has some quality in drawing, but very lacking in other aspects. The music is bad.\n\nFinal VerdictI got this game from a bundle, so it is not a bad loss to me.\nSTAY AWAY FROM THIS GAME.\nI think this game is the Big Rigs of tycoon genre.\n","February 1, 2015","false","3.1"," 64 of 66 people (97%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","97","64","66","2","0"

Scratches bottom... goes to make coffee.  This is a list of things you should do before buying this game.\n\nBasically the game concept has the correct idea, the implementation and system they have gone through is daft.\n\nI hire people who can produce a low quality of work, for cheap.  The publishers demand a Top quality game (88% rating) and will charge me 90,000 if I fail to produce the game in 2 months!! seriously, are they deluded?  this game has probably been in production for more than two months.\n\nThe game engines you can rent (single game production only) are 10k +  you are lucky to make that much money on a produced game.\nTo produce a game engine...  DO NOT MAKE A CHEAP GAME ENGINE EVER.  Go straight to building the best engine you can, with every feature.  if you don't it's a waste of time and money.\n\nWhen you hire people... pay attention to their Quality only.  if it takes them 10 months to make a super good game... Then thats better than a low quality game produced in 10 days. Publisher contracts run out.  Pay attention to how long you have to fill the contract. (making the contract and producing the game they want does not say the game will even sell...)\n\nBasically this game gives you massive overheads of a full sized game company, with the technical production skills of a guy in a garage producing a game for a publisher.  (games of the 80's were not made in big offices with big budgets).\n\nThe game needs a scaling system from start to finish, 0-30% ratings on games for the start and 88%+ in the finish when you have good staff.","February 13, 2014","false","8.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","2"

Even if it did, due to bugs in the game it's impossible to create a successful business from it.\nFor instance, if you create and publish a game and sell every copy of that game that you can create at an enormous profit, you don't actually get a penny of it.\nEssentially, the ONLY income you can get in the game is to take out a loan from the bank. And when you run low on funds you have to take out another loan and another and another and another. This makes it rather broken from a business sim perspective.\nAdditional issues include not being able to publish a game unless the randomly generated publishing contracts fulfill the merits of a game. So you can create a game and not be able to publish it for months and months. Not that it matters since you can't earn off it anyway.\n\nBasically, this is NOT Game Dev Tycoon, which is what you probably wanted to buy but the title of this tricked you into looking here. If you haven't paid a penny for it already, DON'T!

It's just not anywhere near finished and if it is well then they developers need to recheck their definition of finished.\n\nInitially I thought this might be a "sequal" to the very impressive Game Dev Tycoon, but when I noticed the publisher was different I figured that it wasn't. But it still went on my wishlist. Anyway a friend bought it for me and now I just feel like I owe him that money back.\n\nI guess I'll just reiterate what everyone else has said about this game.\n\nThe "controls" are weird. Right click takes you back a screen, escape sends you to the main menu, everything is click and drag, no really clean selection system.\n\nThe voice acting was ok, when I could hear it over the background noises. The tutorial was completely a waste since I couldn't hear the narrator over most of the background noises.\n\nA lot of the UI was really unresponsive forcing me to have to leave screens and re-enter them just for it to realize I modified an option.\n\nSo while I applaud the attempt at making a more "in-depth" GameDev sim, by including more options for publishing, a few different locations, and trying to make it feel more like a business. Please focus on making sure the game is fairly playable before releasing it.\n\nI've seen flash games on the web that have mostly the same design, but not nearly as many of the problems.\n\nAdded: I went back and watched their "trailer" on steam and honestly it even looks like the person who was demoing it had no idea what to do. Also I ran into at least 1 menu still in German?, which happened to be the "publishing" menu. That made it pretty damn hard to figure out if I was trashing my newly minted game or sending it to the public.","February 16, 2014","false","0.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It seemed like a cool game at first, but I was disquieted by the lack of an options menu. "Perhaps I am but drunk?" I thought to myself. Later after trying to play through the tutorial I happened to hit escape in an attempt to go up a layer ----- Exit to main menu ---- No save ---- "What? That seems... Poorly thought out... Let me try again". I tried again two days later and the same thing happened. There may be a good game hidden here under the layers of poor game design and bad UI choices, but I haven't found it.

Unfortunately, there are no moments of fun to be found.\n\nFirst of all, the name is not a good representation of the game. The "game design" parts are basically nonexistent and it's mostly about walking from one screen to the other, so the UI has nothing to do with tycoon-type games. Instead, you are putting engines and games you've forced students to produce into your inventory, so you can print them up and hope it works. The rating system is almost impossible to spot the first time around, and it has no depth what so ever once you do.\n\nAlso, there are no subtitles. Yes, you heard me; no subtitles. This may not sound too bad, but then again you haven't experienced what I have. I had to listen to one of the tutorial missions' same line 15 times (because, if you are not doing what you're told - like entering one of the many indistinguishable buildings - the tutorial voice will repeat the same command in 10 second intervals). Why? Well, the terribly EQ'd voice had already nagged me into going to a warehouse, where a printing machine is a part of the background sound template. It was impossible to hear anything the tutorial said - and, to top it off, this is the same source in the customizable mixer in the option menu.\n\nShort story: this game is terrible across the board. The techincal aspects are horrible, the UI doesn't work, the graphics are below average... I could go on. Take it from someone who spent their money on this thing: don't make the same mistake.","March 14, 2014","false","0.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And let's not talk about the sound issues. In the factory, for example, the machinery sounds drown out the tutorial. Okay, great. At least going to the save menu and back gets rid of the sounds for you. Oh, and the voices are bundled in with general sounds so there's no easy 'turn down sounds to hear voices' option either.\n\nA lot more work is necessary before this is a game worth playing.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liwolfbyte/recommended/273770/","liwolfbyte","Liwolfbyte","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liwolfbyte/","92 products in account","Having knocked up a couple of hours, I think I'd share some information and feedback about this game. In part, to counter many of the negative reviews that don't give the game the credit it deserves, but also to give an honest perspective.\n\nTo start with, let me say that it doesn't necessarily deserve the negative feedback that it's getting. The problem here, that I see, is that some are experiencing issues with the game and the software tutorial itself doesn't give a whole lot of help to resolve it. That said, there are some issues that deserve mentioning and some interesting features that also deserve a few words.\n\nGraphically, the game is pretty nice and certainly well laid out. There are different areas to head to for specific intentions and it works well. The controls are well thought out and it's effortless to shift between each area. Use of the right mouse button to transition between areas is an boon - since many of this sort of game neglect the use of said button. The music, too, isn't too annoying and blends nicely in the background, with an easy to find method of turning it off and on. It's smooth and not too demanding on modern systems (meaning pretty much any system from the last 5-8 years) but that's to be expected in an older title.\n\nThe game itself seems to borrow some ideas from other games, which isn't unheard of. There's a few places where I immediately thought of Airline Tycoon/AT: First class. Again, not a bad thing but hardly innovative either. There's lots of clickables in the world, though there's no real explaination of what they do, if anything and I did notice on the official forums/website for the game that there's very limited support for English speaking individuals, whereas there's a wealth of support for German speakers. Hardly the end of the world, but considering the planet is more English speaking than German, maybe something to look at down the line.\n\nOn to the negatives.\n\nTo start with, I have to make mention of the lack of subtitles. Many of the spoken lines can be hard to hear through any form of background music, be it ingame or otherwise and with no means to read that spoken word, rather than listen to it, it's a little annoying.\n\nAlso, the method the game uses to publish your titles. You have to have a contract with a publisher - there's no method of self-publishing (at least, not as far as I got - which was into the early 90s) and promotion of your titles doesn't really seem to fit. This is one of the game-killers for me. I can earn money - make some top notch games but without a method of publishing, I'm limited to the contracts on offer and that, to me, makes little sense. If you're sitting on a few million and you have the means to buy a publishing company, you would if it was financially viable.\n\nAlso, there's a lack of polishing to this game and, again, I recognise that the game is ancient in PC gaming standards ( 8 years or so). Nevertheless, a little extra work could have made the game more enjoyable. There's a great start here, but it needs more, especially as the tycoon market seems to be pickiing up again and competition is starting to hit the shelves again (Game Dev Tycoon immediately comes to mind).\n\nSpeaking of which. Another of the features this game is really missing is R+D and this is something that goes right back to the dawn of computer gaming. Without R+D, there would be no innovation, nothing to set the big companies aside from the little. Also, when you take over a competitor, it would be nice if you could keep the name and use it for, say, publishing or research or whatever else your mind fancies, rather than the name disappearing. There's little to stop you from taking over and becoming an umberella company that publishes games from your child-companies.\n\nThe game, on the whole, is good, though it has little replay value because it ends up being a chore to rinse, lather, repeat. Adding more staff options would help and delegating some of the more mundane tasks to AI workers would allow you to manage the areas you want to, without having to keep doing the same thing over and over.\n\nAll in all, if you're looking for a distraction and want a few hours of game play here and there, it's worth the investment. It's the sort of game I, personally, would keep going back to while deciding what main project I want to start (Mount fo Blade, Tropico 4, whatever) and it has some value there. However, if you want something more meaningful, either look at Game Dev Tycoon (also an indie title and a demo is available) or wait and see what happens with Game Tycoon 2.","April 21, 2014","true","6.5"," 25 of 85 people (29%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","29","25","85","6","2"

Yes, you get to create games and sell them on a market, but I look at it alittle different. At first I found it alittle frustrating trying to figure the game out, why it was so difficult to make any money and lose over and over so quickly even on EASY. This is probably the main reason most people rage and troll the game, not every game is intended for young children with little to no attention span. Now with that elephant out of the room...  The word tycoon, makes me think of business, to rule over all competitors like the a particular board game that just makes everyone mad at each other at the end of the game LOL. So basicly I am saying this game, true to its name is, to at least me, saying that it is a Company trying to be the best business out there..and for those of you that really understand how business works, lets just say it really doesn't matter what you are selling, what it is really about is profit and the benifits you can buy with it once you make more and more of it. I would recommend this game more for mature, oldskewl gamer types. Sometimes its not about the graphics or the gameplay..sometimes its about figuring out how to not be a noob, intil one day you look back and laugh at yourself with great achivement and humility, because you overcame so many of your mistakes. That to me is a real game, pff you kids today are so spoiled with your save points every 10 feet..there used to be a time where one tiny tiny mistake made you completely restart hours and hours of progress.\n\nANYWAY LOL...a few hints for those of you that read all this ribble-rabble. *****HINTS****get a max loan..make any game quick and cheap doesnt matter just get it out into the market and advertise your image alittle. doing this will raise your stock % from a crap share to a few dollars, trust me its a HUGE difference if you have say 1000000 shares... just saying any way once you get like 2-6$ a share sell it all and get a few million in the bank, pay back your loan and SHAZAM! you have just earnd better credit, dont worry you can just make a "erotic game" genre to lower your image a.k.a your stock value and just rebuy it at .01 a share just after you sold all of it for 5$ a share LOL and you can rebuild it again and again, trust me this game is uber fun and easy once you get the hang of it, so trolls, go play cod or something and leave the indie games to the professionals :P THANKS FOR READING IF YOU DID,KUZURNOTA-L7WEINER ;D","April 23, 2014","true","4.5"," 16 of 69 people (23%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","23","16","69","3","1"

In full-screen mode, whenever you change windows, the game blinks to the desktop to show you a loading bar, then goes back into the game with the new menu.  There is no useful information in the game, tutorial or otherwise, to get you started.  The audio always works fine, but sometimes the voices seem to work, while other times they don't.  However, if you take the time to watch someone who has learned this game play it on Youtube, I think you will enjoy this game for a while.\n\nI watched someone else play, was reminded instantly of MAD TV (an old German DOS game where you run a television station in a similar fashion), then bought the game in a bundle.  It is similar to MAD TV in a few ways.  You run your character around various places to draft ideas for games, hire workers (programmers, artists, composers), buy engines until you can afford to make your own, produce the game, then get a publishing contract, and finally ship the game to stores.  There's even a store you can enter to check the top 10 selling video games, until your game stops making money, where you then can try to sell it or throw it away.  There's an auction to get license for real movies and other popular brands (I had a spoof of Indiana Jones that sold well, but also cost me a lot).  There is enough going on in this game at any given point to where you get in this loop of design, produce, sell, and it might take you a restart or two, but with a little trial and error, you can be successful.\n\nOverall, this game is definitely a lower budget title, and it shows.  I would've liked to see a bit more, such as gaming conventions like in Game Dev Tycoon, or even awards that your game could win from reviewers.  But like MAD TV, once you learn the ropes of the game, and finally avoid going bankrupt on your budgets, it's a pretty solid simulator.  Nothing special, but it's definitely entertaining for a couple of hours at least.","March 26, 2015","true","4.5"," 0 of 34 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","34","0","0"

As the years pass your options increase for building a better engine. I like the genre choices for making a game and from 2006 the graphics are alright.\n\nI like how you have to buy magazines to see trends and reviews for your games and that the quality of your team really plays an impact on the games. I also like how publishers want a certain level of quality for a game and give you a time span (Personally I just make a game then wait for a good publisher).\n\nThe Bad: Trying to do that tutorial was a chore as you have to wait until he finishes talking to do what he says albiet you have to guess as it never shows you what any of the features are just assumes you know. At times especially in the printing room I couldn't hear him and there are no subtitles.\n\nAs this is an older game I'm gonna be more lenient but still add here that I have no idea if you can train you employee's or not (I oouldn't find anything) but hiring good employee's is expensive so you have to start off making terrible games.\n\nThis game has really long waits of doing nothing but the worst part is when you speed the game up the if you get a message on the PDA it goes back to slow. This is annoying when most of the PDA messages are either a joke or you got money. I'm fine with telling me the stock of a game is low or I lost money for some reason but anything else it should keep it sped up.\n\nOn that note I hate how at the end of the year you are transported back to your office.\n\n\nOverall: My overall rating is a 5/10 it's far from the worst game ever as I've played both Game Dev Story, Game Dev Tycoon and Gamebiz 3. For it's price range it's ok I don't feel cheated. I give it a recommendation but only if you like the genre.","February 13, 2014","true","2.7"," 14 of 94 people (15%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","15","14","94","2","4"

Let me elaborate:\n\nIt's not Game Dev Tycoon, which (to my knowledge) is the newest of game developer simulation games, and they aren't that similar either. Sure they share a theme, but the gameplay is different. In Game Tycoon, you can acquire licenses, you have to print the games yourself, choose what goodies to include in the packaging, advertise your games, see the reviews (they have pics too, though there should be more variables among them) and all that.\n\nThe graphics are cartoony and do their job, and there is voice acting (few lines here and there, nothing major). Music is a bit repetitive, but then again it's a simulation game aimed for niche market.\n\nThe only major problem I have is that it tends to crash on my system, and when it does it deletes my saves. I am not certain if this is a common problem, or just my machine.\n\nI like this game and do not regret getting it.","February 14, 2014","true","8.6"," 15 of 98 people (15%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","15","15","98","3","0"

I mean yeah, GDT looks better and has streamlined flash-level graphics, but it's also simpler. GT 1.5 seems to be more detail oriented and gives, what I assume,  a more plausble notion of realism to the type of industry this game imitates(i.e. traveling around, the hiring factor, bank loans, etc.).\n\nAlso, honestly, the people up in arms this being a copy of GDT or Game Dev Story need to try coming up with lives and then coming up with their own Game Development Sim and try to make something complete opposite of what's already been done.

I love the idea of game studio simulation games and I really wanted to like this one. I read the mostly negative reviews and I avoided this one for a while, then I picked up a bundle of games and this one was part of it.\n\nMy biggest complaint is that it seems unfinished. It's glitchy, it's not intuitive, and even on easy it's hard as heck to get anywhere with it. The tutorial is ok but has a bad habit of repeating what it says. If you have the music turned on forget it, you won't even be able to understand what the character is saying.\n\nThe game itself is a great concept but I couldn't figure out how to make a profit much less make a "quality" game.\nDuring my short time with the game I had to start over about 6 times on the TUTORIAL alone!\n\nNo, sadly, I cannot recommend this game. I think this will be the first game I actually HIDE in my library. I really hoped the reviews were wrong but they are spot on and if you are even thinking of buying this game, read them and HEED THEM!\n\nI hope if I do eventually get to the point of making or releasing anything game related that I do a better job than this.

While Sunlight Games certainly had the opportunity to capitalize on the growth of interest in the genre in more recent years and fix the game, playing Game Tycoon 1.5 is a frustrating experience and one has to wonder why Sunlight Games did not simply start from scratch.\n\nThe visual aspects of the game fluctuate between "passable for a low-budget PC game developed a decade ago" and downright laughable. In some parts of the game, text is pre-rendered as graphics. In other parts of the game, text consists of blue Times New Roman on a white screen. Think hyperlinks on the most basic webpages out of the early 2000s. The music is similar; some is passable, but some borders on the absurd. One track of the game is a six-second loop, but it doesn't loop properly. There is a delay between each loop, breaking any possible sense of immersion. It's like a bad Vine.\n\nThe functionality is, of course, entirely broken. A tooltip will demand that you name your engine even after a name is provided. Buttons and boxes will not work, and progressing in the game requires a lot of rebooting, backing out of menu and, perhaps for some, copious amounts of praying. Easily, however, the worst aspect of this game is its ridiculous mechanics. There are many different actions that the player may take to fund or advertise their game, develop it, recruit staff and so on, more, than one might even expect from a low-budget game. Unfortunately, most time spent in this game will consist of your character walking between the advertising agencies, the university, the bank and so on because yes, that is how this game is played. You do not navigate menus, you walk slowly in a psuedo-3D world in order to get to where you need to go. It is tedious and, miraculously, it manages to be worse than any escort mission because it serves zero purpose.\n\nI know of four games in the game-building genre and this, as a game that isn't even in early access, is by far the worst. Your other options include Game Dev Tycoon and Mad Games Tycoon on the PC and Game Dev Story (personal favorite) on mobile devices. All of these games look, sound and play better than Game Tycoon 1.5, and you would be far better off to save yourself from the circle of hell that is Game Tycoon 1.5. Even if you get it in a bundle, don’t bother. It lacks any redeeming quality and ought to have been forgotten a decade ago.","June 19, 2015","false","0.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
