Unfortunately this game feels like a direct mobile phone port, with no pc features at all. You don't have keys for missiles, enemies can engage on you while docked, no possibility to set the auto target AI to focus on closest/largest/smallest target, and tons of other bugs/missing features that make the experience not worth the time and money.\n\nYou will be always focused by pirates, although you are in a little ship and your friendlies fire/fly close to the pirates. That doesnt matter, the entire pirate feet focuses you and only you. This game is a boring mining grind, then, you can tank your hip up like crazy and just afk destroy entire fleets. No middle ground. ALSO REALLY FUNNY! You cannot escape enemy fleets.... they follow you at the same speed until you're dead... real fun...\n\nI tried to like it but this in no way a PC game. If it is a port from mobile, it's a pretty bad one. If it is a game developed for PC, then it's awful. I DO NOT recommend.\n\nFor 3-4 euros just pick SPACE RANGERS HD or SPACE PIRATES AND ZOMBIES or STARPOINT GEMINI 2 (the 2 pls, 1 is  bad). These game are hell of fun,(I have them all)  complex and revarding. And every sale they are just a couple euros. Just avoid this game.","January 5, 2015","false","6.7"," 73 of 89 people (82%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","82","73","89","6","12"

If you were looking for somewhat of a successor to a game like Escape Velocity (like I was, god I love that series), then keep looking.\n\nPros:\n-The story isn't bad, and the text messages provide good perspective\n-There's a sort of cutesy anime charm to the game\n-Music is alright (but may wear on you)\n-Price  is right\n\nCons:\n-Point and click to go...

Like people talking about the Iowa vs. The Yamato kind of clevar.\n\nThe Bad\n-you tend to have to grind a lot at the beginning. Early on you basically need to find a safe route to either mine or trade until you can get some decent gear.\n-no real faction choice to my understanding. I had a chance to join the pirates for a moment there but no real choice.\n-the police in this game are insane: I am smuggling drugs and there are 6 ships right behind me destroying ships (potentially murdering people) for money and suddenly I am public enemy number 1? what this hell is in these drugs!?!\n-almost no customization: you have almost no choice to upgrade your ship in specialized ways. You can chose to make your missiles hit harder or your beams hit harder and that’s about it.\n-there is no choice to stand down your weapons or surrender. I am playing a smuggler not a murderer. I don't want to have a shootout with the cops until I can leave the system. I would rather stand down my own weapons and divert power to shields or speed to get away.\n-space stations don't care about pirates or smugglers? Here I am being shot at by pirates I dock at a station and they just let them blow me up? By the same token I am running from the police because they spot me with drugs but the station just lets me dock? I can't fathom a universe where the ships have weapons but the space stations don't who is asleep at the switch?\n\n\nThings I Would Change\n-Give the ships 2 to 5 modification modals and add more than just missile power and beam power to it. It could have the weapon boosts but also extra storage adding an extra 4 slots, a temporary cloak costing power (preferably called a Fader :) ), extra shields, shield mods that increase effectiveness against beams or ballistic respectively, crew pods for extra crew (see below)\n-more detailed mining add a scanner to increase the chances of getting certain resources over others.\n-more weapon types please. We have an EMP that jams weapons can we have one that stalls engines? Maybe mine layers, how about a machine gun stile gun that fires smaller weaker beads of energy fires faster but hurts less maybe a tractor beam that slows and eventually stops ships to force a boarding rather than destroying ships.\n-crew customization. Give each ship a crew capacity 2 to 6 each crew man can do different jobs on the ship such as work the engines, weapons, and shield to make the work better, the ability to navigate and increase maneuverability, or simply board/ repel boarders.\n-random mission offers. Passing ships give me all sorts of messages (including quite often the cops telling me how to break the law and expunge my criminal record lol) I think it would be cool if ships randomly offered me a job to protect them or deliver something or even kill someone.\n-gear/ships you can't buy. I would love to have experimental gear you have to find and earn rather than buy.\n-buy hanger space. I have built up my bad ♥♥♥ ship just the way I like it. Now what? Story missions? Personally I would like to buy a hanger slot and start building up another ship. It would also be more realistic to me than them just handing me a new ship every time I blow one up.\n-radar mini map. Down in the corner a tiny map that shows what ships are in the area upgrades and or crewmen could tag patrol ships or pirates or both.\n\nAll and all\nall and all this game is fun! It could be more fun but it is fun, but at the end of the day I am happy with what I spent on it. I know the developer is working on a sequel so I hope they read this and take these suggestions to heart, but right now the game is fun and worth more than I spent on it.","January 8, 2015","true","21.7"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","4"

You start with a ship that is as tough as wet tissue paper, and every ship after the fact is just a slightly higher grade of wet paper that costs more in time and effort than they really should.\n\nCombat lacks any degree of finesse or preciseness; you click on a vague area of space and your ship just putters along without giving you any means of making sudden course corrections to avoid fire. Combat is something to be avoided... if you can manage it. Be sure to always pack an EMP, because there's no other way to outrun your enemies. Of course, if you don't have one, expect to have your ship destroyed, lose whatever secondary weapons you do have, all of your missiles and get stuck back in the starter ship, losing whatever modules it can't equip.\n\nMy only regret is that it took me too long to finally get around to playing this, because I cannot get a refund. Don't make the same mistake I did; avoid at all costs and find a better, much more fun space sim that doesn't go out of its way to punish you for daring to try and play it as anything more than a trading/mining sim where combat is something you should never try, because all your ships and options suck.","January 27","false","1.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It takes all the things that make the 2D action/shooter genre great, and condenses them into a simple yet crazy fun experience. You can make your fortune as a miner, trader or even a pirate (Be warned, betraying everyone doesn't end well :P), but cracking on with the story was the most fun for me. Took me around 30 hours to beat it, which considering the price, is a bargain...\n\nDont let the simple nature of this game fool you, it becomes very challenging as you progress. Early game is all about earning credits and upgrading your ship. Late game is much more about tactical piloting and loadout (and spamming the X key). Some battles might seem too difficult, but keep at it. Theres nothing more satisfying than battling through a dozen battleships with a lone frigate.\n\nThough this game might not be for everyone, if you're into retro style 2D space shooters with simple mechanics, and are willing to rise up to the challenge of restoring peace to the universe (or not), then pick it up and give it a go. I did and I thoroughly enjoyed it.\n\nNow to uncover the myth of the nude key combo...","January 9, 2015","true","30.2"," 6 of 8 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","6","8","0","0"

Its grindy but very open world. The combat is still mixed in my mind. Insta killed or insta win happens a lot more then I would like. Mostly because shields only last for 2 seconds or less and take 5 or 9 seconds to recover. So battles are very fast.\n\nI played a early version of this game and some things have changed. The reward for killing and other missions has been raised so you can make some money off of doing them. However buying and selling is still a good way to make money.\n\nThe graphics look nice and the game is easy to play. The game can be grindy. The developer is a nice guy. I might try a new game to see if some things were changed from the early build I played.\n\nI still hate the insurance thing. To me it makes little to no sense. Its like buying a new car having it totaled and then not having enough cash to buy the add ons it originally had. Its still a pet peeve of mine on this game. Whatever you died with you should get back. Now since I got insta killed by 5 ships in a friendly sector no less I have to rebuy the Miner add on. Ugh.\n\nThe insta killing thing is a pet peeve of mine on games and sadly this game has a lot of it. The players shields should last twice as long as they do now. I want to like this game but it makes it hard.\n\nSo good graphics, open world. Insta kills is a constant threat and getting killed results in a loss of add ons for your ship. I wouldnt mind seeing some sort of handicap system in place on this game. Something that allows the player some leeway instead of just one difficulty setting.  Perhaps a Ultra Hard mode, a Hard mode( I think this is the standard difficulty for this game.) a medium mode and a I can win mode. Mostly just change up the shield strength so that they would last longer on the Easy mode. Say around 5 to 9 seconds with a 4 second cooldown. Just my thoughts.\n\nI would like to see the game become more casual friendly. Right now its a little to much on what feels like the Elite players only group.","February 8, 2015","true","0.7"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","2"

A few missiles and you are blown out of the sky.\n\nSo instead I decided to make a fortune before attempting combat; I traded with the start ship for hours without buying shields or weapons, just bought and traded goods and saved up enough for the 2nd ship with all weapon, shield and defensive options of mk 1 and it went quite well for some time that was until my ship got blown up. Instead of continuing with the ship, weapons and shields I currently had spendt hours acquiring I was reverted into the first ship, i still had the upgrades the ship could handle but lost the second missile launcher. I got about 2/3 of the cost of the ship back, and forced to start all over again selling food and fuel rods to various stations.\n\nIn short the game is not fun when the combat part is so cruel towards the player; you cannot leave the white sectors with the first ship because a single missile from a Pirate Frigate will blow your shield to hell, and when you face 2 of those and 2 fighters you have no hope as they in total unload not 1 but 8 such missiles.\n\nI did not bother attempting to play further into the game; it is simply to unforgiving to deaths and without a save/load function aside from continue your game it isnt a way to prevent the silly deaths. I might just be to impaitent to get to the story and missing out on a great Space sandbox game but I doubt it. The story cannot compansate for any of the messy combat in the game so If you decide to try this game make sure you are a sucker for punishment, otherwise it will be boring.","January 4, 2015","false","1.3"," 11 of 31 people (35%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","35","11","31","2","3"

You need money to buy expensive ships and weapons to do story missions, but the only way to get it reliably is by mining asteroids and trading, which have about the same degree of complexity and player's involvement as Cookie Clicker. Now, do it again, again, and again for several hours. You can also grind the same 5 mercenary missions over, and over, and over again, or just fly around and shoot other ships, but that will be just as much of an underwhelming and repetitive chore. Also, if your ship does get taken down (usually by a group of pirates suddenly appearing out of nowhere and catching you unawares, sleepy or AFK after several minutes of flying through empty Space with nothing happening), you'll lose some of your precious equipment.\n\nStar Nomad is not atrocious, and could be an OK distraction if you're listening to music, or thinking about something, but that's about it it.\n\nIt is also true that the game harkens back to other space sims like Elite and Star Control, but it has so little variety, and the combat system is so simplistic that it fails to keep one's attention for any significant period of time. (the realisation that you've got nothing else to do in the game happened in Elite as well, mind you, but it came much, much later than here). Bland writing, lame, sometimes sexual, jokes and no memorable characters does not help the case, either.\n\nSexy (if not sexist) art tho.","January 2","false","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
