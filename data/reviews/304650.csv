When their mutiny failed, I sailed them back to London. Once home was in sight, and they gathered at the rails to sing praise, I promptly turned the ship around and sailed it in a circle. And then another circle, this one wider. Then, a third circle, this one smaller.\n\nNo one commits mutiny on my vessel.\n\nTime moved swiftly as the circles continued. My crew only had a faint understanding of what punishments were in store for them as I spent the night in my cabin, fornicating with our surgeon. Around and around and around we sailed.\n\nIt soon dawned on them what was happening when the nightmares came, when the food and supplies began running low. Once the food was gone, the madness came quick; the frightened tears, quicker. One member wanted to kill herself, but I wouldn't allow it. Another begged me to stop the endless circles, so I sailed them faster, sloppier. Once, I sailed close to a zee-beast. It swam away, wanting no part in the theatre of suffering I was producing. An entire meal, the crew's last hope of staving off death by starvation, had gone. Only the circles remained.\n\nIf they wanted to live, they had to eat. Keeping their humanity was no longer an option. They knew what little choice they had, and what little they could do to control it. Out of food, cannibalism quickly took hold on the decks. Crew members butchered and ate each other after yet another failed mutiny. And back in my cabin, all I could do was muse with my sultry lady in lilac, the crewmembers' wails of grief a very, very potent aphrodisiac for more fornication.\n\nWe sailed, ate, sailed again. The rhythm never broke. A circle without end.\n\nSoon I took part in the feasting of a brazen zailor who tried to shoot me and failed spectacularly in doing so. The few remaining crew and I ate him and we said nothing of the incident. They knew better. The silence was terrible for them, and it pleased me. Nearby, a cargo vessel sailed past us without pause. You could almost smell the bounty of food and fuel aboard it. They never knew what we were doing, or what we've become, circling without end. Then, they were gone, and my remaining crew came undone.\n\nI shot a crewman who attempted to abandon ship, and I tossed his body overboard. I did nothing as another member leapt overboard soon after, only to be swallowed by the waves, screaming about Salt's curse being set upon us. I dined with the lady in lilac again as the second to last crewman wept and succumbed in his sleep to nightmares, alone and misbegotten.\n\nI believe his corpse is still decomposing in its spot, somewhere in the dark in the lowest corner of my vessel, the Unsinkable II. He shall remain there as a souvenir until I see fit.\n\nFinally, when it was just me and one broken crew member left, I turned the ship portside and set us off. Time to stop the circles; home was near, just at the edge of the screen. I paid a hefty fee for a tow and returned to port, to my zeeside mansion, where I slept like a baby that evening.\n\nLondon was oblivious. Or unmoved.\n\nTomorrow, thirteen new crew members await orders to set sail. They haven't the foggiest of what to expect.\n\nNo one commits mutiny on my vessel.\n\n10/10","February 7, 2015","true","43.9"," 4,415 of 4,614 people (96%) found this review helpful 3,564 people found this review funny","96","415","4","564","154"

We haven't seen coast in nearly two weeks now, and the men are growing restless... what men I have left. Three have bailed ship since we left port. In vain we tried to retrieve them, further depleting our fuel. My one officer, a shifty surgeon, keeps his many secrets to himself. My mascot, a sickly ferret, just rolls his eyes at me. Great crabs circle menacingly and pirates grow bolder. And the reefs, like ghoulish skulls... they stare from great and empty sockets from the dark and swirling abyss, yawning their maws invitingly. “Come now captain,” they seem to grumble, “come now and sleep.” It is sorely tempting. The rum is getting to my head. I'll sleep now, I think.\n\n“Sunless Sea” is essentially Early Access H.P. Lovecraft. You're presented with a rich alternative universe: Victorian London has sunk beneath the waves and the steampunk denizens of this new world set sail, seeking treasure and purpose only to find madness and horror. It's an RPG through and through, a classic one at that. You'll select your captain's silhouette, title, and backstory (OR MYSTERIOUS LACK OF A BACKSTORY) and set sail. Random events will occur at sea with chance outcomes. Do you take a risky action in the hopes of some gain, or do you play it safe? The combat is turn-based/tactical but... happening in real time? You can pause and choose your actions FTL-style or just go off the handle, selecting maneuvers, firing weapons, and illuminating your targets in the dark and treacherous waters. You'll travel to distant ports, selling souls for more fuel and supplies, upgrading your ship, and hiring new crew, all the while unraveling the secrets this strange world holds. And when you expire (or sleep that long and fitful sleep) you can carry discoveries or important crew to your next game.\n\nIt's very rewarding to explore, and the devs promise even further expansion. Landmarks will appear on your map and your journal will fill up quickly as you drift further and further out to sea... but always keep an eye on your supplies, fuel, hull health, and crew terror levels. It would be foolhardy to stray so far from home only to find yourself crazed, eating your crew as madness envelopes you like a malevolent blanket. Or a giant ♥♥♥♥ crab decides to slice your little ship in half, whatever comes to turn first (edit: there are no giant ♥♥♥♥ crabs, unfortunately. I use ♥♥♥♥ as a descriptor. Sorry!).\n\n\nThis is a fun game. A twisted romp through Cthulhu's sunken playground. Like with all Early Access stuff, you can wait if you're hesitant. But the developers have crafted a deep and fascinating game here and promise to update consistently. You can visit their website and see what they've done so far to help you make your decision.\n\nIf you're a fan of FTL, of Lovecraft, classic RPG elements, and roguelikes, then you'll enjoy “Sunless Sea.”\n\nNow sleep. You've earned it.","July 1, 2014","true","9.8"," 1,269 of 1,364 people (93%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","93","269","1","3","30"

None but I were alive on that ship. I sunk into the depths for the second time. That is when I swore that I would have my vengeance. I was no longer Promthelius - a dapper chap of Fallen London.\nI was Ahab - and this game; my great white whale.\n\nI started from scrap. I had nothing but a ship and a gun. I started trading Sphinxstones. I brought them to London for a nominal fee. It was not living, but surviving. Pirates swarmed my trade-route. I tried to avoid them for a time, but my ship would not take me further with the holes in it's hull. It slowed to a crawl, and five Pirate-ships sank me with an impressive display of teamwork for a bunch of thieves. I heard the laughter as I sank into those obsidian depths below. Was this how it ended? Was this how Ahab would be remembered?\n\nNo.\n\nI would not succumb there. I was Ahab. I was the reckoning of Promthelius. I was two generations of seething disdain for this world, and all that inhabited it.\n\nI started again. I threw caution to the wind, and traded wildly. With naught but two hundered echoes and two barrels of fuel, I found the Salt Lions. I once more started trading in sphinxstones.\nPirates swarmed, but I mostly avoided them. They laughted, jeering and taunting me. Was I a Coward? Perhaps.\n\nI traded sphinxstones until the Salt Lions ran out. And thus began one year of sunshine. I traded empty boxes of mirrors in the city of Khan's Shadow, and captured the sunshine from the Neath in droves as I emerged there from the Cumaean canal. Three boxes turned into six. Six turned into sixteen. I bought a new ship - a trading vessel with one hundered and twenty units of cargo-space. My Empire of sunshine on that opaque expanse.\n\nMy plan was not without fault. Pirates tried and failed to sink me. I faced much danger upon those waters. Men and women so uncouth and guileful that they should like to rob me were swarming those waters. But with purpose, I sank or avoided all that followed.\n\nIn the end, ninety boxes of sunshine at each time was delivered to the Isle of Cats. I netted tidy sums of money. The Isle of Cats was a sun upon my obsidian empire. But the age of sun could not last. My last run ended in roaring success. Sixty thousand echoes filled my vault.\n\nOnce back in London, I had only one purpose.\nWith my money, I bought an Eschatologue-class Dreadnaught, and all the battle-gear that Fallen London had to offer.\nIt was expensive, but vengeance is a dish best served with overwhelming firepower.\n\nAnd through my cannons, upon the deck of that Dreadnaught, my justice had finally come. I ended the reign of Pirates in a single day. Unfinished revolutionaries, Pirate Steamers, Republic Dreadnaughts and Glorious Dreadnaughts. It made no difference. All were sunk. All plunged to the depths under the sound of my cannons. Some say that they can still hear me laughing. There are no Pirates upon these waters, Friends. Only death.\n\nI am Ahab. And I have taken my great white whale. My vengeance is complete.","February 12, 2015","true","25.7"," 1,019 of 1,097 people (93%) found this review helpful 578 people found this review funny","93","019","1","578","26"

While I love the concept behind Sunless Sea a lot, and it definitely nails it when it comes to tone and atmosphere, but the game itself has some fundamental flaws that erode its fun factor a lot.\n\nThe good: Graphically, it is a rather beautiful game, depicting its underground sea in an almost painterly way.  It captures the rich, dark, almost Lovecraftian tone of it's world perfectly; and the artwork it uses to represent the characters and creatures populating that world are great too.  It's writing its fantastic, fo rthe most part, and make me wish there was a straightup novel I could buy that would let me dive more deeply into its mythos.  The gameplay itself is a rather simple top-down view of your ship, but it is effective, fun, and evocative of older sailing titles from the 90's like Sid Meyer's Pirates.\n\nThe bad: The game is designed around perma-death, and while that is actually a feature that drew me to the title in the first place, it doesn't really work here.  You are going to die... a lot... and unless you managed to advance to the point in the game where you can pass things along to an heir, which is NOT an easy task, that means you have to start all over again.  By the fifth or sixth attempt, it grows really repetitive to have to re-find the same officers, have the same conversations, re-encounter at the same obstacles at the same ports, and re-read the same blocks of text (no matter how brilliantly written).  In the end, after my ninth captain went down with his beautiful customized ship, I just didn't have it in me to start in a crappy little boat all over again.\n\nThe bottom line: I'm still recommending you buy this game, if you can get it on sale, so that you can experience the good stuff it does have to offer... but be aware that it does have some flaws that will become increasingly hard to overlook.  3 out of 5.","September 16, 2015","true","17.9"," 422 of 454 people (93%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","93","422","454","13","7"

Failbetter Game's previous effort, Fallen London (which this game shares the same universe with) has grown massively over time, and so has Sunless Sea. But right now shortly after release, Sunless Sea is a bit sparse. And it's got a lot of issues that need resolving.\n\nThe first big issue is the combat, which is very basic at the moment. It works, and it's exciting and dangerous at first, but once you play for a while it becomes very dull and simple save for a few specific "boss" monsters, and even then it's just simple and dangerous. A lot of new AI and balancing is going to be needed before it gets interesting.\n\nAnother big issue is size and speed. Your starter ship is almost unbearably slow and at first the world seems vast, but once you get past the (HUGE) initial difficulty wall, upgrading to better ships and engines with a fully explored map reveals that the world actually isn't all that large. More a lake than a sea. Honestly, the game would be better served if the map size were scaled up 15% and all of the engines moved about 10% faster than they currently do. Then at least you'd feel like you were moving, and the world would feel a appropriately large.\n\nThe next (and really the biggest) issue is replayability. The game offers a lot of good story content in it, and this content is fixed. However the world is intentionally very harsh and you're bound to die a lot early on thanks to that big initial difficulty wall. These two facts result in a major problem where the narrative content ends up directly at odds with the death and respawn "legacy" mechanics.\n\nNamely: you're going to end up re-reading (more likely skipping through) lots of stuff you've already read before. Finding out about a character's past or an island's secret is really cool the first time, finding out about it the fifth time? No so much. There is currently no mechanic - and certainly not enough content - in place so that the different lives you start encounter notably different story experiences in the game, which would be the obvious solution to this problem.\n\nHowever, looking at how Fallen London has grown, and some of the systems already in place in Sunless Sea, I feel it's safe to assume that as time goes on more stories and content are going to continually get added in. There's already a pretty big expansion planned, and been a steady drip of new stories over the last month. They even just added a new alternate method to end your current game, so it's not like these are minor updates.\n\nEssentially, what you're likely to not realize (I certainly didn't) when buying Sunless Sea is that this is more a single player MMO that's half Naval Elite/Sid Meier's Pirates and half Victorian/Lovecraftian Adventure gaming. Knowing that is probably more key to whether or not you should purchase it than anything.\n\nThis game is currently strong, but threadbare after you spend some time with it. In a few months? I'm guessing it's going to feel much fuller and robust. In a year? It might actually live up to the immense potential it has.\n\nTake that as you will, and certainly, if you're not the type to trust that a game will reach it's full potential in time or don't like that development model, hold off. But I'd encourage you to check back later when it's gotten a bunch of new content.\n\nFor myself, I've found more than enough so far to justify the purchase, and have enjoyed the vast majority of my time with the game. The promise of more to come is just a bonus.","February 22, 2015","true","112.2"," 225 of 234 people (96%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","96","225","234","4","0"

It's almost more of an immensely well-written and beautifully-illustrated Choose Your Own Adventure novel than it is a traditional action game. There are definitely a lot of game elements, but the real draw is the writing and the artwork.\n\nI haven't played many other similar games but it reminds me a lot of Darklands, actually, at least in that you're traveling over a great big area dotted with ports, and the story happens mostly through illustrated text blocks in those ports.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, you sail (well, steam) your little boat around and you can upgrade it with better engines, guns,etc., or upgrade to even fancier boats once you're zee-rich. There are lots of sea-monsters that travel at varying speeds and in specific areas and so you have to either fight them (using a combat interface with various timed attacks and dodges in a queue) or evade them by clever sailing (loop around them, angle so you go past them, outrun them if you have a fancy engine). You can make money by running missions and trading between ports and capturing pirate ships and selling off the exotic oddities you find in the gullets of slain sea-beasts.\n\nOn top of that, there's a light/dark/terror mechanic; shores are illuminated and there are lighthouses and lantern-buoys scattered around, but most of the sea is dark. When you're out in the dark your Terror rises, when you're in lit areas it doesn't. As your terror rises bad things start happening and at 100 Terror your crew mutinies and you have to pass a stat check or lose the game. You can lower Terror in towns with various options, but not (generally) while at sea. Net result is that travel is largely about scuttering from lighted point to lighted point and sticking close to shore, and minimizing long plunges into the dark (though such are necessary from time to time).\n\nThe game is a bit sedate to play -- you can pause to think at any time -- and they're still implementing a lot of the planned content and tweaking the balance. There's enough implemented that it's very much worth playing, though.\n\nThe real strength of the game is the writing and the artwork and the atmosphere; it's powerfully evocative, amusing and intriguing and chilling by turns, and just a pleasure to play.  It's definitely not an action game, but it's an experience worth having.\n\nedit: I should mention that I've mostly played the Humble Bundle version as until recently they hadn't fully set up patching through Steam.

Yes, the writing is pretty good and yes the stories are interesting. The problem is that they are only good and interesting the first time you read them. The true horror of this world hit me on my third captain when I realized that nothing was ever going to change. You come to realize that everything is always the same, and nothing varies. Get port reports for the Admiralty, with the same cute flavor-text repeated ad-nauseum. Go ashore to repeat one of the exact same 1-3 random events every time. Go to sea and realize that the exact same monsters will continuously appear in the the exact same positions forever. Recruit the same paltry handful of officers, with the exact same stories, resolved the exact same way every time. And then you can go the really stand-out islands with in-depth stories and mysteries, only to again realize that these are played out in five minutes through random-chance screen-prompts with maybe two or three alternate paths. In about 30 hours (as of this writing) I really feel like I've seen pretty much every single thing it has to offer. And this is simply unforgivable for a game that sells itself on the fact that you will die.\n\nBased on that, I expected that characters would change and cycle. That only a few officers would be available to any one captain. That entire islands would disappear from the zee, and whole new ones would appear. That Fallen London would be teeming with traders, demons, nobles, thieves, naval officers, etc who would constantly change out and be replaced. That the trade goods and prices would change and your new captain would be forced to again explore and seek out the best suppliers and the best buyers. Areas you previously considered "safe" would now be home to vicious beasts. Basically, that playing as a new captain would feel rewarding and new. That's the sad part. It isn't. Nothing ever changes. Considering that the game is basically all text and random chance prompts, there should have been hundreds, if not thousands of stories and events that you could potentially see. There's really no excuse for how utterly static the world is.\n\nThat might be something you could ignore (though not forgive) if the game was fun to play, but it's not. Trading is so utterly pointless I don't understand why they even bothered adding items to the game. You will never be able to make more than three Echo per commodity, and you'll inevitably have to spend that profit plus an additional markup to replace the food and fuel you used to trade those goods in the first place. Exploration is a complete crapshoot because more often than not finding something valuable will require you to pass a skill check and you will never have enough skill points to have even a decent chance. When it comes to fighting monsters, just get to the edge of them, flip the boat in reverse, and then keep blasting the engines as you shoot them. You'll basically never be hit again.\n\nI will say, just like everyone else, that the music is excellent and the atmosphere was very intriguing while it lasted. That is not enough. If you still find yourself interested, then please play the browser game instead. It's free, and it has a lot more content than you will find here.","February 9, 2015","false","33.3"," 1,258 of 1,499 people (84%) found this review helpful 49 people found this review funny","84","258","1","49","46"

Maybe it's the present patch, but it seems you can't trade anything with anyone. The only port I've found (Venderbight) that accepts goods in it's "shop" (all the others I have found just sell supplies and fuel for your ship and are not interested in trade goods) offer for the two goods you can sell either a paltry profit of two bucks, or 'Echos' or a loss of about 7 Echoes? At the moment, trade just doesn't seem worth it at all. Like, at all.\nEven if you were to take a load of goods to Venderbight, you are coming back to London empty as there are no trade goods to buy. What the sense make?!\n\nSo the only other way of making money is doing survey missions (or hovering around the starting area capturing pirate ships for prize money), which is fine but often you'll find your profit margain getting wiped out by having to replace your fuel and crew used in the journey, as well as 'carousing' back at port.\n\nIn essence, it seems almost impossible to get any amount of money. Some two hours in and I'm still struggling to get more than a few hundred Echoes, with dreams of buying upgrades or a new boat a very, very long way off.\nI appreciate it defeats the challenge if they just give you a pot of gold easily, but at the moment it's far too difficult and the grind for cash is painfully slow and not enjoyable - given the limited amount of ways you can make money.\n\n2) Terror. What an excellent idea, as you sail the black ocean, darkness all around you, only the chug of the engine and the weak bloom of your headlamp lighting the way - the miasma of fear and paranoia starts to grip your crews minds... Bells in the distance.. Giant, squid eyes watching you from beneath the waves...\nAgain, all good stuff. The more terror you accure, the stranger things occur and eventually you go mad. However, given that you start at 0 and within the space of one trip (within the starting area where the terror affect is less) go up to about 50+ out of a 100! That's a big steep isn't it?! I thought these were hardened sea hands, not yellow bellied land-lubbers?!\n\nThe best way of avoiding a terror increase is planning your route so you sail through area light by bouys or remain very close to shore. Makes sense. But sometimes you have to find yourself sailing for about ten seconds in a dark area or drift a smidgen away from shore and your terror ROCKETS, I mean, it just flies up at a rate of knots!\nCalm down lads, the shore is still on screen but.. - oh? Apparently that's not close enough. Even when a light ship or a bouy or land is clearly but a stone's throw from your ship your sailors still flip the f*ck out unless you are about a gnats testicle away before they calm down.\nHaving your own ships lights on doesn't seem to affect this very much, your terror goes up super fast regardless.\n\nAnd the only ways to reduce terror are FANTASICALLY expensive. The 'best' way to reduce terror to a managble level is to return to London, where your terror is reset to 50 automatically (but you start to get nightmares), but to reduce it further you have to 'carouse' either in London or elsewhere. This costs between 40-20 echoes depending on where you are and reduces your terror from 1-5 points. Is that all?? That hardly seems cost effective given within a matter of SECONDS after leaving port you can accure those points back up again.\n\nAt the moment, you gain Terror far, far too quickly and it is much too difficult and expensive to reduce it.\n\n3) Combat. Oh man, can you imagne! Sailing your steamer straight towards a giant Angler Crab or Lifeberg, screaming blood and thunder to your terrified crew as they struggle to bring their harpoons and deckguns to bear, shining your ships lamp straight into the beasts unblinking eye!!!!\nExciting stuff, except none of that happens here.\n\nCombat for me so far, consists of trying to run away from an enemy I have no chance of beating (anything outside of the starting area, I am not kidding) as I have nowhere near enough money to buy better ships or equipment, fleeing into the nearest port, then having to leave port and being killed instantly by the monster who is still waiting for me. Game over.\n\nThe combat system consists of you or your opponent sailing into the other, where upon you are offerend the choice of fight or flight (or human  sacrifice, neat!) and then combat consists of a picture of you, a picture of the enemy and an 'illumination' bar for each. You want to raise their bar as much as possible, whilst keeping your own bar low. Once it's high enough, you press the 'shoot' action and then hopefully they die.\nBut normally they don't and kill you instantly. The amount of enemies that can kill you in one hit is daft.\nThere's no dodging, no position, no tactics, no *skill*. Just press the 'flare' button twice, press the 'evade' button a few times, then press the 'salvo' button. And then repeat as necessary. Again, it's not... Fun.\nThere is an option to 'study' your foe in the midst of combat, but this has to be done several times and leaves you open to being annihilated.\nAgainst the easier enemies, combat is a chore. Crabs, bats (who seem to swarm near Venderbight), starting pirates can all be mostly be killed in three actions which equates to 30-40 seconds of your life you'll never see again. It's not engaging, as someone who has played many a sailing combat game over the years, it's uninspired and not enjoyable. FTL did a similar system much better.\n\n4) Death. It's a hard game, it's a slow game, it's a game with what appears to be a great deal in it. But as such, death comes fast and furious.\nAfter 2-3 hours of not managing to get much of anywhere, I was still mighty ♥♥♥♥♥♥ when my ship glitched aground and then.. Game over. Which is fine, I mean it's a roguelike and it's not meant to be easy... But when it takes you HOURS to get much of anywhere from the start and you can die so easily by hook or by crook, it's maddening to see all that hard work thrown away.\nIt's almost like having to do a lap of the Binding of Isaac, without any items - and at the end of the lap you get *one* item for the next lap. But as soon as you die, that's it. Whilst some masochists would love such a challenege, Joe Muggins here thinks that doesn't sound like fun.\n\nThe 'merciful' mode helps with regards to this, as you can save on the fly. But you can either play it safe and live a long but dull life, or try the dangerous game and die fairly rapidly and see all your hard, slow, progress of upping your skills and saving your money go to waste.\nAt least when you die you can save a skill for your next character.\n\n5) Conclusion.\nSunless Sea is a fantastic idea for a fantastic game. However, IN THIS CURRENT VERSION it is not especially enjoyable to play IMHO.\nIf it does tickle your nautical fancy, my advise would be to wait until full release, as this may leave you with a sour, salty taste in your mouth.","July 3, 2014","false","15.2"," 785 of 969 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","785","969","0","53"

Lovecraft's Pirates!, don't. Turn right around and go play Pirates! or Sea Dogs or something free-form and piratey. If instead you want a mysterious, story-rich world to explore and never fully master, keep reading. Much like the people and creatures you'll meet in this game, Sunless Sea is not at all what it seems.\n\nThe game sets you up as a zee captain in the unique and storied Fallen London setting, a Victorian-era underground sea full of cosmic horrors. In creating your character you choose a background and a goal, and then prepare for your first journey. Every port is presented as a series of journal pages, with you choosing actions based on the resources and stats available to you. Everything is abstracted as cards, from cargo to terror to snippets of news, which makes it clear to see what you need to access or complete a story, but hard to tell what is actually valuable before you find a use for it. It's a strange system held up by the quality of the writing, which never becomes tiresome in its quirky melancholy and ominous reveals.\n\nBetween ports you sail the sunless seas in real time from a bird-eye view. Your ship has three major resources to manage during voyages. Fuel powers your engines and your deck lights, supplies feed your crew, and terror measures how stable your crew actually is. There's a lot of interplay between these resources that will affect how you sail, which livens up the trips. Running your deck lights burns almost three times more fuel, but sailing in the dark ramps up your terror faster. You can sail past natural lights and coastlines instead, but your crew will be consuming supplies at a constant rate, making long trips costly.\n\nOdds are that mismanaging one of these resources is going to be what kills you, because you burn through fuel at an alarming rate, and terror mounts quickly and is hard to reduce unless you know the game well. It'll be that or one of the sea's monstrous inhabitants, which are almost all more than a match for your sad little starter ship. And when you die, you lose pretty much all of your progress. There's an heir system where you can pass on one item or a bit of money, and once you start an estate you can create a will to pass on more resources. As far as stories and quests go, however, it's back to the beginning, and this is where the game starts to really come apart.\n\nAt some point playing Sunless Sea, you're going to realize you're not really making any progress. You're learning the systems and uncovering stories and accumulating... things, but every time you die, and you WILL die, most of that gets wiped out. You can do things faster on the next captain, but the goals in the game are so long-term and require so much work that they come to appear almost impossible. It might be that you need seven of something from the opposite side of the world that you can only get once per trip, or you need one of something that you had and then lost and have no idea how to get again. And the sailing is so slow and the resources so strained, that soon the oppressive and mysterious atmosphere will turn to tedium.\n\nYou're not going to beat Sunless Sea, I'd wager, and frustration or boredom will claim you far before that's even a possibility. So why do I recommend it? Because despite all that, I keep coming back to it. Part of me still wants to puzzle out the stories, find new ports, and maybe someday mark down a victory, even if it takes liberal use of the wiki to do it. The stories don't get old, and a dozen hours in there are still more to discover. As long as you understand that you're getting a nigh-endless choose your own adventure book where you sail (and very possibly die) instead of turning pages, there's a good chance you'll get your money's worth.","December 11, 2015","true","12.1"," 200 of 226 people (88%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","88","200","226","5","0"

I honestly can't praise the game enough. Why is that?\n\nThe writing is sublime. The atmosphere, sound and setting all incredible and haunting in equal measure. In navigating the lonely, dark seas, one can't help but be completely immersed. Whether you are ferrying bandaged Tomb Colonists to distant islands, or sneaking mysterious fungi into remote outposts, you'll be having a terror-tinged blast.\n\nFuel and supplies will run low. Huge, ferocious creatures will stalk you through the dark. Terror will slowly creep in. The game is difficult, perhaps even a little too daunting at first, as some have found. But just diving into it, venturing as far as you dare and exploring the remarkable amount of content on offer will see you reap the rewards. Both in monetary gain in-game and satisfaction out-of-game.\n\nThe development during Early Access ironed out the majority of the last remaining kinks, and has left the game in a fantastic place. If you appreciate a wonderful atmosphere and truly original writing, and have the urge to explore the wonders of a unique underground ocean, definitely check out Sunless Sea.","February 6, 2015","true","82.8"," 155 of 181 people (86%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","86","155","181","8","3"

The idea of trawling a black, underground ocean is compelling and fascinating. But I can't recommend it. Why?\n\nThe actual gameplay is boring, repetitive, and simple. You will be doing the same routes repeatedly for tiny profit margins for hours until you can afford the most minor of upgrades. I have to impress the hours part. Unless you look at the wiki for money exploits, you will spend literally hours trawling back and forth in a very slow ship. You won't be in a ton of danger unless you didn't buy enough food or fuel.\n\nIn short, if you've been tempted in by comparisons to FTL, turn around now. This game is not a fast paced roguelike ship sim like FTL. If I had to compare it to any game, I'd probably pick Ambrosia's Escape Velocity (1996), which had a similar slow burn price for entry.\n\nAnyway, if you heard all that and you still want in: welcome to the club, it's moody and interesting. I just feel like players entering this game are being done a disservice by comparisons to other roguelikes, like FTL, when it is nothing of the sort.","February 12, 2015","false","39.4"," 215 of 265 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","215","265","4","8"

I've done sort of headings in caps, to guide you through. It's thematic.\n\nNOT A ROGUE-LIKE\n\nFirst up, let me say: I think terming it a rogue-like is misleading. "Rogue-like" (to me) implies a game with randomness and a subsequent emphasis on improvisation at its core, whereas SS is really about storytelling and (perhaps most of all) atmosphere. I love rogue-likes (Spelunky and FTL, for instance, are tops), but that's not really what this is. AFAIK, the only randomness is the placement of the islands. Also, I think if anyone ever creates a good random story generator they will become insanely rich.\n\nREALLY WHAT THIS IS\n\nI'd say SS is really a throwback to games like Elite or, more closely, something like (fire up Google) Star Saga--games all about exploration and what-happens-when-I-do-this. It's basically a great world and story on drip-feed, whereby the text-based interactions (and, dare I say, the real fun and excitement) are spread out by the forced need to sail the sea (sorry, Zee) and get the resources necessary to progress.\n\nBUT I DO LIKE THE ZEE\n\nHaving said that, I'm more than happy to be forced to sail the sea. The graphics and the (especially excellent) soundtrack create a cracking atmosphere, and I find myself getting sucked in to the sense of romance and horror, of threat and adventure, even though after my initial explorations I'm basically just pointing my ship at the next port and sitting back as it chugs slowly along.\n\nHOWEVER...\n\nHowever, this is where I foresee some people getting frustrated. There's not much "game" to the sailing, not really. Combat is basic, and usually unnecessary. All the enemies I've encountered can be trivially avoided, and going from port to port is, as I mentioned, quite slow (although you can upgrade engines/change ships eventually). But having said that, I really enjoy planning out my routes--working out where to restock on fuel/supplies, thinking how I'll manage terror and cargo space--it really adds to the sense of being a true Zailor.\n\nVERDICT\n\nLike I said at the top, it's great. But it's not a challenging game. People complaining about grinding are doing it wrong, IMHO. Go, strike out, explore the darkness! Take some risky decisions! I did, and look at me now.\n\nFOR THE RECORD\n\nSo you know: I'm on my second captain; I have uncovered basically the entire map; I am still in the starting ship with its starting engines.","February 6, 2015","true","37.5"," 109 of 120 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","109","120","3","9"

I bought it a month or so ago when it had much less content and was much easier and I couldn't put it down. I would prattle on to my friends about Compulsion (the ridiculous engine that eats fuel and makes you speed across the zee), the rejected marriage proposal I made to the Deviless (she thought I was joking! I gave her my soul, even!), the Pull of Nuncio, the Principles or Coral, the best way to get Searing Enigmas, the mysteries of Station III, the riddle of Visage, the frustration of dealing with the Khanate...\n\nI would stay up late reading excerpts of the amazing prose to my boyfriend and both of us were absolutely rapt with attention and immersion into the world of Fallen London. Watching the stories connect with each other and the gating system of content (Something Awaits You means you must spend some time at zee before unlocking more stories or events) keeping me on the edge of my seat...\n\nThis game has consumed my life and my attention. I love the concept and mechanics offered by using information as inventory items. I love opening the game to see the "New Stories Available!" button lit up and being excited for more of the amazing artwork and prose being available.\n\nIn the past while, the game has been being balanced as it prepares for release. It's made the game MUCH harder. Things I took for granted in the past: "I can take out this 210-point-hull with torpedos and crazy weapons with my 75-hull one-gun starter ship, no problem!" or "a risky challenge? ah, whatever, it's just crew/hull/terror/supplies/fuel!" or "my engines only explode SOME of the time..." or "psch, curses? whaaaatever" are now HOLY CRAP BAD. Needless to say, I've restarted the game a few times lately as the reality of the harshness of the zee has dawned on me.\n\nBasically, if you have an appreciation for story, this game is (name an addictive substance). If you're like me, you'll lose yourself in it and you'll love every minute of it and you'll chortle whenever someone talks about wells and you'll wake up in the morning, look at the sun, and have a voice in the back of your head saying "REJECT THE DAWN MACHINE."\n\nIf you're like me, you'll love it so much you'll want to create a d20 campaign based on the universe, you'll want to get a tattoo of a letter of the Correspondance (Don't do this. Seriously. Bad things will happen.). You'll have dreams about the Sundered Sea (the wicket calls), of finally completing the Neathbow or of what lies north. You'll spend time explaining the impossible colours of the Neath as you use words like gant and viric in daily conversation. You'll talk about Maybe's Daughter or the Brisk Campaigner or the Haunted Doctor or even Phoebe and speak of the conversations you've had with each of them over dinner, because you know what brought them to zee and you want to help them even if it means losing them in the process.\n\nSo, yes, highly recommended. Lose yourself in this game. The world is amazing. I've never been so proud to have spent so much time with a game.","January 25, 2015","true","111.0"," 132 of 153 people (86%) found this review helpful 18 people found this review funny","86","132","153","18","1"

It packs a great amount of literary content (and I do mean by "literary" given how many words this has), solid worldbuilding and the constant feeling of "there is much more in the background", thanks to how the lore is revealed to you: snippets, fragments and bits that by themselves may seem quirky, odd or totally alien, but as you go around and learn, a bigger picture starts to form. Exploring the mysteries of the Neath and the Unterzee while avoiding whatever unknown terror of the depths, the dread of hunger, the lack of critical fuel or even the very wrath of strange gods is atmospheric , to say the least.\n\nIf only this was an interactive fiction, though.\n\nSunless Sea, however, is a game. While story and ambience are clearly paramount in this, the "game" part is, well, not good enough. Since you need to engage with the game in order to explore the story, it suffers due to bad gameplay: once the novelty is gone, you will be instinctively drawn to keep your beaten old steamer around the familiar routes of Fallen London and try to grind some measure of resources to make sure you can survive your next journeys. Sunless Sea makes very clear, from the beginning, that it wants you to take chances and explore - but when you have lost a few captains and you are generally aware of how things work, you realize how woefully lacking is the earliest part of the game and how much of a slog it is to make a modicum of improvement.\n\n(This doesn't get any better even after that.)\n\nWhich brings to the problem. The game's economy is focused on the three critical resources: hunger, fuel and terror. Managing all three may seem like a juggler's act, but a few tries here and there will give you the hang of things. Echoes, the currency proper, is the solution to the balancing act. You can afford a better engine, which makes journeys faster; better weapons, which makes you able to fight whatever the zee throws at you; a better ship, which makes everything more useful. Because of that, players quickly realize that they need cash early on to overcome the slog.\n\nAnd, of course, you start to grind. Because you are grinding, you are not exploring. Because you are not exploring, the game loses its charm and effect FAST. But you need to cash in order to explore without being an awful drag. Of course, given how things work and the very orientation Failbetter wants for Sunless Sea, they quickly took care of the means to make money that were seen as "gamey" (see "The Sunlight Trade" if you are curious).\n\nSunless Sea is very original and has a lot of entertaining stuff, packed to the brim with lore of their setting (which comes from Fallen London) and the siren's call of a big, unknown Unterzee beckons and dares you to explore all of it. However, the sluggish, dragging-by-its-feet gameplay, an extremely repetitive early game (again: once the novelty wears off) that quickly becomes plain boring and a lack of alternative means to allow its players to just succeed  means that is not for everyone.","March 5, 2015","false","54.1"," 186 of 233 people (80%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","80","186","233","5","1"

Some things that previous captains had (crew, weapons, money) can be left to new captains and for many, it’s getting your head around the idea that death isn’t going to be the end of it for the game, but a new beginning.\n\nWhat I love about this game is the mass of narrative within it, the different stories (of which there are hundreds) and the ways in which you can travel this world for days (literally) without losing interest in searching and finding new things, I've got more than 200 hours on this and I'm still finding things that I've never seen before, and I expect that I'll still be finding them 200 more hours from now.\n\nI’ve been playing this since before it hit steam, and so my perspective isn’t that of a person who’s just picked the game up, and while the initial difficulty will put many off the game, persevere, because the rich and detailed content that’s in the game will only become apparent when you’ve given it some time, and the things you learn from the other captains that have perished before you will stand you in good stead when it comes to starting again.  When you know where to find Lorn Flukes and Mount Nomad, when seven colours aren’t just myths to you, and when the Principles of Coral have yielded to you, then and only then will you see the promise of the game.\n\nAnd if you need a hand with anything, come to the forums, I’m Rocket Heeled Jack, dead many times and always back for more...\n","February 6, 2015","true","322.5"," 76 of 84 people (90%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","90","76","84","8","0"

Through the writing alone, it drew me into its world and ate me whole.\n\nThe problem is, that's all it has. Combat is rudimentary, even at advanced stages of play, and never really changes, and the economic system is an economist's worst nightmare.\n\nThe standard unit of currency is the Echo, but it's almost never actually used ;some items are bought for entirely different items, most items are only sold and never bought, and many items can only be acquired in one location. You'd think that having such a small supply pool would make for great profits, no? Actually, no. You generally make something like a 10% profit on any particular commodity; that's BEFORE you account for fuel costs, supply costs, the cost of keeping Terror down, and the chance you'll get randomly attacked by a Lifeberg or have a stalagtite fall on your ship or any number of other terrible things that can happen purely at random.\n\nBut there you go; you've made a dozen trading trips, accumulated a tidy thousand echoes; you can now afford a 20% increase in engine power and a weapon that does 4 extra damage. Congratulations, for all your effort, you've achieved nothing.\n\nNot even the quests you can get are particularly effective, as they tend to reward you in strange, symbolic ways, or with stat increases that help you succeed at further quests that give further stat increases; I kid you not, one sequence of quests is simply a check against a stat, a roll of a die, and if you win, it increases that stat and gives you a few echoes. Then you do it again, with a slightly higher skill requirement (handily provided by the last quest!)\n\nBut none of the quests are good for the progression of your character; the best quest will maybe give you 500 echoes, after you sell off all the strange and bizarre items it rewards you with - of course, after you pay for the fuel, supplies, and crew that you've lost finishing that quest, you'll be lucky to come out in the black at all.\n\nThis ultimately results in a game with a massive quantity of theoretical content, with more advanced ships, equipment, and weapons, but with almost no way to actually get them. Even worse, there is almost no reward *for* getting them, other than the ability to do the same things you've already been doing to get them in the first place slightly better. For example, there is an enemy called a Lifeberg. It is fast, deadly, and has a large pool of health, and when killed, rewards the player with upwards of 300e of supplies and fuel. In order to kill it, you need roughly 20000e of equipment.

The first time across, it's beautiful. The 8th time across, you see something you never saw before. But by the 50th time across, you just look forwards to the 500 pages ahead in despair.","October 30, 2015","false","65.2"," 175 of 230 people (76%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","76","175","230","10","8"

I want to, but I can't.\n\nSunless Sea is a very original and interesting game with a unique setting. In it, you choose who you are from a select few backgrounds and victory conditions, then you embark into the titular sea to explore and achieve whatever goal you set for yourself. Think FTL, but instead of jumping from event to event you actually steer your ship there and can sail around the map at your leisure.\n\nAll of this sounds good on paper, until you have to start managing your resources most of which cost money. the early game will see experienced players shooting back and forth between the main hub (London) and various select locations that can be farmed for money. Money will get you new ships and improvements like any other game, but the problem comes when this money farming grind starts to spill over into the mid game and even the end game. next thing you know ten hours have gone by and your still running sunlit mirror boxes back and forth for cash because your nice new ship consumes more fuel and supply. Only on occasion do you find the time to explore other parts of the map or continue a story line for one of your officers.\n\nAnd then, when on your 20th journey to the money farm, you die. Why? No idea, because after 20 times you stop actually reading the text for the event.\n\nSunless Sea is a game I want to recommend, but the grind is pushing past the level of most japanese games. What I can say is that it's a game that needs a sequel, because there's a lot of great stuff going for it, and even more stuff that needs improvement.\n\nEDIT (adding comments from below)\n\nHey guys, thanks for the comments, but I do know about port reports and exploration. In fact I definitely enjoyed the game a lot more after just going into the save file's code and giving myself all the money (I cheated, sorry).\n\nAfter doing that I was free to enjoy the stories and encounters and fill out my entire map. And I will admit I enjoyed the game a lot more then, after a few more hours I just got bored of having to travel through the sea, remember which ports have what, and so on.\n\nI'm afraid the game is just not for me. But thank you for the suggestions\n\nMaybe if steam had more than just its current binary scoring system I would consider something closer to a neutral score. But, since I'm forced to choose, "not recommended" is closer to how I feel.","September 1, 2015","false","21.3"," 572 of 827 people (69%) found this review helpful 25 people found this review funny","69","572","827","25","19"

I love love love this game. Imagine a Victorian Steampunk world with a heavy dose of Lovecraftian goodness and a Choose Your Own Adventure style of playing, and you get SUNLESS SEA!\nFirst the positives. There is absolutely tons of material. Readers will love this game because there are so many stories and it would be impossible to cover them all with one captain. You give your captain a history and profession, and depending on what you choose will determine your crew and your stats. You then head out into the black sea to explore and discover. You can either choose to find your father's bones, amass a lot of sea stories for a book, or retire wealthy in your seaside mansion. While you are pursuing your goals, there is also your crew members. Like in Mass Effect, they have interesting side missions and also help boost your stats. There is also the romance option. The music in this game is very original and is enjoyable to listen to as you play.\nNow for the potential negatives (for me this game is almost perfect). This game is not for everyone, and I would be lying if I said that I didn't see how other people couldn't adore this game as much as I do. First of all, don't play this when you are tired. Since you have to read everything, you need to be awake and alert, or the game can come off as boring. Also, there are no cut scenes, voice overs, or AAA graphics. If any of these things turn you off, do not invest in this game. You will die A LOT. But that is okay because you are supposed to. With each captain you learn more about the harsh world you are playing in and your strategy improves. However, many will probably not like having to die a lot to achieve headway.\nFor me, this game is highly enjoyable. It may not be for everyone, but for those who love stories and a steam punk Victorian setting, it is a gem. If you are wondering whether this game is for you, check out the game Fallen London done by Failbetter Games. It is free and it gives one a good idea of the gameplay storywise. I look forward to many many more hours of exploration and new stories.","May 28, 2015","true","100.6"," 61 of 66 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","61","66","0","3"

I refused to buy it until it was finished and for once, a game that has been in early access for quite some time, delivers.\n\nRight off the bat, to give you a good idea of what the game is about, lets talk about pros, cons, and what you'll be doing during the game.\n\nThe Game\nYou make a small Background for your character, a "Zailor" in the wide and sinister underground vault known as the "unterzee". You hometown is Fallen London, the only safe-ish port to which you will periodically return to manage your posessions, trade, rest and recover your mental sanity.\nThe game itself consists in going around on your boat, with your officials and crew, facing the countless dangers of the pitch black unterzee, establishing relationships, managing fuel and food, trading, fighting monsters and doing quests (often very creepy stuff), all trying not to get mad and start murdering (or eating) people.\n\nPROS\n-Fantastic, sinister and immersive setting\n-Lengthy and detailed writing with lots of plots and mysteries\n-Challenging. You have to earn secrets, rewards, discoveries through risks and strategy.\n-Good longevity\n-Really really unforgiving. In the age of super simplified games, with bright luminous arrows pointing in the direction you have to go, the old "you're on your own" is a breath of fresh air.\n\nCONS (but not really)\n-Very time consuming. It is not a bad thing, strictly speaking, but you usually tend to get carried away... time flies.\n-It necessarely requires a good amount of trial and error, meaning that at the beginning of the game you inevitably fail a lot of challenges, find yourself invery bad situations before you realize it and so on.\n\nGive it a try if you like roguelike games, Lovecraft, and reading.\n\n8.5/10","February 9, 2015","true","100.2"," 68 of 79 people (86%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","86","68","79","2","0"

Playing this game is crafting your character's story at each step you take. It reminds me of Heroes of Might and Magic where a decision could be the difference between failure and success. Despite the outcome, the story never stops being written. It also has some Don't Starve in it. It's rather difficult to remain alive and upgrading your ship while exploring the sea. Yes, ship, you will be navigating 90% of the time looking for secrets and ways to improve your skills/crew/ship and preventing terror that drives you mad. It's a solid adventure, looking forward to the updates.\n\nPros\n- it's damn challenging\n- play it your own way, become the captain of your choice\n- the graphics give you this hand painted feeling\n- there's just so many stories, riddles and secrets, I always find myself intrigued about everything\n\nCons\n- the gazetteer (journal) is a mess, I get myself lost in it, there must be a better way to point out the active "missions"\n- although I understand the game encourages you to just explore, I would like some more specific goals with more currency rewards, I struggled a lot to keep myself up","June 30, 2014","true","0.7"," 165 of 227 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","165","227","0","16"

Combat is very basic and rare in the game. The game relies more around discovery and resource management, which is initially fun, but then you die. Once you die only a bit of progress from your previous game carries over. This results in a repetitive feel after your first life at zee. The zee is truely gorgeous, but loses its excitement after rediscovering the same islands and ports every playthrough.  It all turns in to a big grind after a while. If you want a better ship expect to wait hours sometimes days. This aspect of the game then conflicts with the lore. It takes me several generations to afford anything cool, and by that point I have read the same stories several times and am just mindlessly clicking most of the time.","October 23, 2015","false","11.4"," 217 of 318 people (68%) found this review helpful 9 people found this review funny","68","217","318","9","1"

Despite my best efforts -- spinning tales of comfort for my zailors, brazenly defying Nightmares, even initiating an affair with my engineer -- I'd managed to let my Terror get all the way to 100%. The achievement pops up; "Lose Your Mind". This doesn't bode well, but I'm a mere ship's length away from home port, and docking will reduce terror to 50%; a much more manageable level. Surely I can hold out just a little--\n\nI'm instantly presented with a choice between murdering my entire crew (with 12% chance of success), or attempting to win them over (9%). Failing either one, I was told, would end my game. I did the only thing I could do, and somehow managed to kill everyone aboard, save two. We made harbor and, with a fresh batch of new faces, set out to zee once more.\n\nTime passes.\n\nAn adventurer whom we've been running jobs for finally announces that he has all of the supplies he needs to make his final journey and I, having proven my capability, am his first choice of transport. There's just one problem...my trusty ship lacks the capacity to hold his cargo with room for food and fuel. We're going to need a bigger boat.\n\nI buy a bigger boat and hire on twice again as many zailors as I already have. We load up and set sail, but not before I accept just one more smuggling job from my "friend" with the bad eye and the concealed knife. Corsair's Forest? I've been there a dozen times; consider it done.\n\nIt's not until we're two days out that I realize my new ship has half the speed of my old one, and my triple-size crew are a hungry bunch. We're running low on supplies before we've even reached our initial destination, but we make the drop and start to head home.\n\nThen the realization strikes. If we dock in London now, before finishing that smuggling job, I'll have to cough up the fee plus a hefty chunk of interest, not to mention lose a valuable connection...but the nearest trading port is in the opposite direction.\n\nIt took every scrap of food we had, but we managed to reach Mount Palmerston without resorting to cannibalism...again. We traded with the devils for supplies and loaded up on coke freshly dug from Hell. On our way home we made port at Pigmote isle, where a civilization of guinea pigs threw a banquet in our honor -- their returning saviors, though this time we were the ones in need of saving.\n\nAfter a harrowing encounter with a manic Jillyfleur brought hull integrity to 1%, and a misbehaving Clay Man took five lives before we subdued him, we were desperate for rest and repair. An ill-fortuned shore leave on Gaidur's Mourn pushed Terror to worrying levels, but we had our package. As we pulled out of the port, a straggling pirate ship fired one last shot across our bow -- but the shell missed by an arm's length and we were homeward bound. Two days later, limping into port with a skeleton crew, I breathed a sigh of relief that I'd narrowly escaped losing my mind for the second time in the space of a week. My sweetheart and child welcome me home. I say nothing of the suicides -- surely they were suicides? -- that only I had been privy to. I pass on an uncanny artifact to my son; someday he, too, will be a zee captain, with enough cares of his own. No need to trouble him with details.\n\nMy friend has another job for me, and the Admiralty has need of news from the outlying colonies. I take a loss on a purchase of a smaller ship, name her after the one I'd traded to begin with. Eighth of my house and 211 days at zee, I sail on.","May 2, 2015","true","94.8"," 50 of 57 people (88%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","88","50","57","8","0"

Eat your crew,” but my ship captain gave birth at zee and she didn’t eat her crew. Yet. Or her baby, in case you were wondering. She safely deposited it back in her home base of Fallen London, just to be sure. Her sweetheart probably watches over it while she’s off zailing across the Unterzee. …Probably.\n\nThere’s a lot more to Sunless Sea than popping out babies on your ship. That only happened once, I swear. There are giant crabs, giant jellyfish, giant sharks, giant eels, giant eyeballs, giant pirate ships—all of which are very eager to kill you or at the very least bust up your ship. Leading your ship to sink…and killing you. Okay, maybe I was right the first time.\n\nThere are also a lot of words. Lovely words. Unsettling words. Downright horrifying words. Your ship’s officers have their own stories that you can slowly unravel (or you can ignore them completely, which may not be the best idea), as do the islands you can explore. Many of the islands have their own factions, and currying favor with the residents can lead to benefits for your captain as well as story tidbits. You can also romance some of your officers, if that’s your thing. Hey, when your fuel and supplies are low and it’s even darker than usual and you’re really far away from home, sometimes things just happen, okay?\n\nSunless Sea is a game that revolves primarily around exploration rather than trading and combat, though those are part of the game as well. Trading and fighting are rarely the most efficient way to make Echoes (the game’s currency), but venturing far from Fallen London and satisfying your curiosity will often be rewarded. Or you’ll die. Repeatedly.\n\nExperiencing the beginning of the game as a new ship captain is rough and it may feel frustrating at first, or even like a grind with very little payoff. You will die, possibly in quick succession. There’s permadeath in Sunless Sea, though you can continue your legacy through a Scion if you upgrade your lodgings to at least a townhouse and procure a child somehow—and give it weird stuff until it wants to go off to zee. No amiibos or iPads for your bundle of joy, at least if you want it to grow up to be a proper zeefaring captain like you.\n\nHowever, if you want to stave off death a bit longer and you’re just learning the ropes, you CAN enable manual saves, which makes things considerably easier. Not easy—there is no “easy” in the Unterzee—but it might help you find your zee legs at first.\n\nThe game itself is beautiful, especially when you look at all the detail in the 2D islands up close or glide through the darkness and notice the waves crash, snow fall, and all sorts of things glow. The music can’t be praised enough, and does a lot to add to the hauntingly beautiful atmosphere (you’ll probably see this word come up in a lot of reviews) of the game. There’s a reason so many people are clamoring for the soundtrack.\n\nThere’s a free browser game called Fallen London if you want to get a better idea of what the writing and setting are like before buying Sunless Sea, and you can get some bonuses when started a new captain if you’ve played the browser game first and link your accounts.\n\nIf you like reading and dying, I’d highly recommend Sunless Sea—or even if you only enjoy one of those things.\n","February 8, 2015","true","27.3"," 49 of 56 people (88%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","88","49","56","16","8"

Hell is close, immortality is cheap and the screaming has largely stopped...\n\nIf you'd like to explore this wonderfully gothic setting before taking the plunge into the Sunless Sea, then you can, for FREE!\n\nFallen London, the literary RPG and pre-curser to Sunless Sea, is a free (and also very excellent) browser game where every choice has a consequence.\n\nSet in this same Victorian Gothic world, Sunless Sea gives you the chance to explore beyond the boundaries of Fallen London and out into the dark and forbidding Unterzee.\n\n\nShallow Waters\n\nWhen you first fire up the game, you'll find yourself at the "Captain Creation Screen" although don't go expected a crunchy RPG level of stats and traits here. This is a bare bones affair and one which you can skip completely if you like (although this will also be reflected in your game experience...).\n\nAfter quickly creating a Captain with the briefest of bespoke back story, you’ll buy your provisions, recruit your crew, wave goodbye the glowing port lights and set sail into the depths of darkness.\nHere you’ll find treasures to satiate the sole and terrors to drive a man to despair, here you’ll find death.\n\nBut before death takes you, you’re going to be in for an interesting ride.\n\n\nCaptain Birds-Eye\n\nThe game itself takes place from a bird’s eye view of the map, you’ll sail your ship out into the unknown where you’ll discover foul monsters, foreboding islands and forbidden ports.\n\nWhen you encounter a Zee Monster you'll could well end up in a battle to the death, but this isn't nearly as exciting as it sounds.\nThe combat mechanics are certainly the weakest part of the game, you'll fire at the monster, wait for the guns to reload and fire again, over and over until one of you is dead.\nYou can upgrade your guns in port to add a little more depth but it's still an extremely simple and lack lustre affair.\n\n\nDon't Forget To Pack\n\nThere's also some simple but vital resource mechanics at play here.\n\nYou’ll need to worry about fuel and food supplies when you leave the safety of London, run out of fuel and your ship will be stranded, floating in the darkness until madness finally takes hold... maybe.\n\nRun out of food and you and your crew will starve, although there is meat on the crews bones, it’d be selfish to let it go to waste when it could sustain others...\n\n\nRemember to Write\n\nBeyond this basic resource management aspect, this experience is all about narrative and what wonderfully written and atmospheric narrative it is too.\n\nEach Island and port reveals its own secrets, its own story fragments and its own harrowing decisions to make. Each and every one of those decisions will impact what comes next.\n\nYou might get to recruit a new officer  for your crew, who’ll likely have their own back story and agenda; you might end up dining with some mysterious sisters or bargaining for your very soul.\n\nThe quality of writing here is superb, but be warned, you’re going to be doing a lot of reading in this game.\n\n\n1000 Words Paint A Wonderful Picture\n\nAll aspects of the story are delivered to you in constant blocks of narrative. You should approach this title as more interactive novel than game. If the sound of all that reading puts you off then this probably isn’t the game for you, but you will be passing up on a rough gem.\n\n\nDon't  Fear The Reaper\n\nAs a rogue like title, no matter how cautious you are, your first captain will die.\n\nThen you will find yourself back in Fallen London creating your second captain, again with his ambitions and background story and maybe he’ll even have benefited in some way from your first captains adventures.\n\n\nThe Zame but Different\n\nYou’ll set sail across the unterzee again.\n\nAs you move out, you might feel disheartened that you’ve lost nearly everything and you have to experience the same story elements again, but you’ll soon discover that the island you’d set sail for, the one that Captain number one had discovered is no longer there, just empty “zee” awaits you.\n\n\nCruel Zee\n\nDid you bring enough fuel to get back to port from here? You could push on and try to find another island, maybe you could turn back to London.... you need fuel to keep your ship light burning too, maybe you could stretch out your reserves by turning it off.... it’s so dark out there though.... the crews terror levels are rising... Could you risk insanity in the darkness?\n\n\nThe Calling of the Zee\n\nAs a rogue like title, no matter how cautious you are, your second captain will die and you will find yourself back in Fallen London....\n\nYou get the idea, each time you start fresh with a new captain the world shifts around you, you can’t expect Islands to be found where your previous captain left them.\n\n\nDifferent Tides\n\nWhilst it’s true that the core elements of the narrative will remain the same, each decision you make will have an impact on what will follow.\nChoosing a different narrative branch will give you a different perspective on fragment of the tale you’ve previously played through help keeping things fresh and adding further depth to the experience.\n\n\nFresh Waters\n\nThere’s a lot to explore out there too, you’re not going to run out of content too quickly, that’s not to say that there won’t come a time when you’ve experienced everything sunless sea has to offer, but that’s true of all games and in sunless seas case new content is still being added, so even if you think you’ve  ....

I have died to shipwrecks  by hitting land, from monsters, pushing the engine and causing fires, ran out of food and ate my crew, ran out of fuel and got attacked by other ships, lost crew members due to terror and other events that unfold  as a result of my negligence. Whenever you do die however you are able to bring one thing with you on restart, your map, who you were, or your skills. are to name a few\n\nOverall I thought the choices was really interesting in certain situation , the feeling of accomplishment of making your first few echos which is the game's currency,  and the challenge of surviving and progressing the story.\nThis game isn't everyones cup of tea remember, it is a heavily text game so expect much reading with whatever you do from choices to combat to everything else basically, I can't recommend this game for people that are impatient with reading and it is very good if you do take the time to read. You'll have to anyways\n\nAnyways long story short\n\nPros\n+ Dark Themed game with good music\n+ Fun gameplay of choices that will affect you and your crew\n+ Beautiful artwork\n+ Phenominal writing\n+ Choices you can make\n+ Fantastic story that will leave you thinking. Very dark\n+ Combat redone to be better than what it was in alpha, before it was a light turn mechanic that look card based, now you actually press button and shoot at the enemies in ze sea.\n+ If you are a fan of Fallen London you will love this game.\n\ncons-  HEAVILY TEXT BASED GAME, if you don't enjoy reading you will hate this game\n- This game can be a challenge for some, and not a cup of tea for everyone\n- Jokes can be a bit sophisticated for some people to understand. You either get it or you don't\n- Game content consists mostly of text and isn't too much on the gameplay itself. The gameplay is flipping through the text to decide your choices etc.","February 7, 2015","true","2.8"," 65 of 83 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","65","83","3","5"

If you meet the following critera, I believe so.\n\n-You love reading. The writing in this game paints an otherworldy abyss where life still finds a way. Your choices are impactful on the world. Exploring the evolving enigma of the Sunless Sea is an unmatched experience.\n\n-You enjoy survival. Fuel, supplies, crew, and terror. These are your diminishing resources. When you set out on a voyage, preparation is key. The Sunless Sea will tax you at every turn. Your crew will go mad with terror, be devoured by monstrosities, and otherwise claimed by the unknown.  Fuel burns quickly, even moreso with your bow lamp blazing away, fending off the terror inducing abyss. Supplies dwindle, Canabalism is an option, but not a welcome one.

In this, it means you spent 10 minutes going in one direction, cruising by (beautiful) empty landmarks, running out a fuel and simply sitting there until you quit.\n\nIf you try to play more cautious - not go out too far, prepare before taking on challenges - you'll find yourself in a trading simulator. Go to A, buy 10 of Item, go to B, sell them and return to A, or save scumming to reload the pirate you have an 80% chance to actually get loot from. It literally takes hours of the same tedious gameplay before you can get even the first set of marginal upgrades (crew officers).\n\nIt takes forever to get anywhere - both in-game travel, and player progression.

On one hand it’s one of the best written interactive experiences you can find, but on the other hand it’s also on of the most slow and tedious ones where most of the game mechanics are actually artificial padding in disguise.\n\nIn the almost 40 hours I’ve invested in the game I’ve not even come close to finishing all the quests and usually that would be a great show of a rich game. But with Sunless Sea most of those hours are spent empty, slowly traveling to and forth, collecting the required pieces to progress the story. It also doesn’t help that the economics system is as convoluted as the traveling, making the trading almost impossibly slow to progress from.\nThat’s not time well spent in my opinion and I very much would have wanted a much denser experience.\n\nIt’s also a very rich game world that completely lacks any overview to make sense of it as you progress through the narratives. The journal that is kept is so minimal that each occurrence is only given a few sentences each, making it impossible to keep track of what you are doing or what you should do next without writing it all down.\n\nI would recommend it to anyone willing to take comprehensive notes by pen and paper, as well as having an oversight with huge amounts of time spent transiting between the different story points.\nThe writing and the lore is of such excellent quality that it could almost be forgiven but for most players the artificial padding will be to much to overlook.","January 27","false","37.1"," 64 of 88 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","64","88","2","2"

To win, you need to advance within the story, a text-heavy adventure where you have five stats (iron, veils, mirrors, pages, and hearts) that dictate your chance of success during story events. There is a main objective based on your choices during character creation, but there is a HUGE story progression. And I mean HUGE. Certain events will trigger future events which will close off certain story branches and open others while different characters, cargo, skill levels, etc will open up or close off story branches. There's lots of room for replay here as long as you don't decide to google answers for optimized playthrough.\n\nThe story itself reminds me much of Lovecraftian horror. I've encountered quite a few events that read just like Lovecraft fiction, building up suspense followed by something quite strange (usually something monstrous). Like a proper horror (and especially so in Lovecraft), you're often left without a full explanation, allowing your brain to struggle to fill in gaps.\n\nThere's a lot of moral choice here, too. Due to how hard it can be for an inexperienced player to make profit, these choices oft-times fall in the category of sacrificing something valuable for money, while at the same time, ensuring you feel a bit of remorse for certain questionable choices. The game does an excellent job of ensuring that even the most amoral players will still feel the sting of immoral choices and yet deliver proper incentive for taking the moral high ground.\n\nThe Zee: The Unterzee (or the undersea), to be precise. Sailing dark waters has never been more terrifying. Your money and your hold space make certain that you are afraid to wander too far from home. And the game mechanics make certain you need to wander too far from home to succeed. There's a constant feeling of anxiety and dread. Do I have enough fuel? Do I have enough supplies? If I take on this cargo, will I have enough fuel and supplies to make it home? Is my crew so terrified that I need to worry about mutiny?\n\nYour major aspects when out to zee are your fuel, supplies, and terror. Running with your lights on helps reduce the increase of terror, but eats up fuel. You can go full power to sail faster should your terror be running high or supplies running low, but there's a chance you might damage your ship or lose crew members. Many random events happen out at zee to influence these factors. And as your terror rises, these events often become more menacing. Supplies keep your crew fed, but are also useful for trading in many places.\n\nI've spent many trips barely limping back to London intact and the experience has been amazing. Unlike many games that use proper risk vs reward systems, Sunless Sea ups the ante. Not only do you have to take risks, but you must learn how to plan those risks. This, of course, means you will die quite a bit during the learning phase, but you will get a few captains that you really learn a lot with. Then they die.\n\nThere's also the matter of the map. Technically, it's procedurally generated. The western shore is always the same, ensuring you have at least the base ability to get a foothold started in the game. Many places are generated in certain relative areas, as well. Other than that, the placement of the locations throughout the sea is randomized, which will keep the fog of war interesting in future playthroughs as well as ensuring you won't be able to memorize the map for the best possible routes.\n\nFinally, there's combat. Combat involves your ship and a rather small collection of mobs - either sea monsters (giant angler crabs, giant morays, bat swarms, etc) or enemy ships (usually various pirate ships). The combat isn't really exciting, but it does throw a hazard into the game which you can sometimes use to your advantage. Mainly, it serves as an extra tension-driver that you will want to avoid - especially early on. With resources often stretched thin, I found myself making some hard decisions about whether to engage an enemy or avoid an enemy. In any case, it works well with the game design.\n\nI highly recommend this game if you don't mind text heavy games. There's enough non-text exploration and adventuring involved to make the large amount of text interesting. In fact, I often find that after a harrowing sojourn, I welcome plenty of text to read while I collect myself.\n\n","February 5, 2015","true","2.3"," 37 of 44 people (84%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","84","37","44","2","0"

Eventually, as you explore the 'Zee', you'll discover that there are certain safe routes between the islands and you can start charting milk runs that will run you through 12+ ports, gathering smatterings of resources here and there until you get home and add another little pile to your fortune.\n\nEach of the ports your ship checks in at  has its own little stories, adventures and chance encounters. The writing in the game, while somewhat overwrought at times, is solid and while there is a constant temptation to just skim things and hit 'continue', I usually didn't do that.\n\nBut the problem is that so much of the game is locked behind obscure requirements that are quite literally impossible to figure out without a trip to the game's wiki. I spent an absolutely horrific amount of resources trying to finish my gunner's side mission. The last step is to go to a place called Station III and talk to a guy working there, but Station III is locked and will remain locked until I bring some kind of copper box to them. Where do I get this box? I don't know! And I have no way of finding this out besides Google.\n\nOn another occasion, I found a shipwreck that I could explore by bringing special 'Foxfire candles' inside. My next trip to London, I bought some of those and went to the ship and found... nothing (the candles were still used). Confused, I gave up and looked up the wreck on the wiki and found out that it's apparently impossible to find anything inside there until you trigger a quest in another town.\n\nSo it's weird, convulted and a fair chunk of it is sailing through empty seas avoiding fights. I'm thus tempted to give this a 'No' recommendation, but I suppose the writing is strong enough to tip it over the edge.\n\nStill, consider this about the most lukewarm recommendation a game could ever receive.","March 8, 2015","true","20.9"," 30 of 34 people (88%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","88","30","34","3","0"

It's atmospheric and intriguing in the beginning, great music, interesting islands to visit, but most of the time you just spend cruising around doing nothing. This is still fun for the first ten hours or so, until it starts getting tedious.\n\nThe game urges you to explore, yet in practice it just penalizes you for curiosity. You're exploring a new region and you want to go visit this island, then that island and then the next one. You try to make sure you have enough fuel and supplies to get back to London, the home port, and usually it works out. However, sometimes you just don't find islands to sell you more fuel, or you run out of money to buy them. And then you die. Although you can inherit something useful from the previous captain, starting again as a new character in practice means all of the progress you made is lost. That's the name of the game in rogue-lites, I know, but in Sunless Sea the Core Gameplay Loop is that you just sail the empty sea, which is extremely boring until the novelty wears off. I just want a fast forward button in this game.\n\nDying and having to start again in Sunless Sea does not mean that get to try another type of playstyle, although there are a few different "classes", but the differences are very minor. No matter what kind of character you have, you always do the same things. Nor does dying present a new challenge to overcome, it just means you have to do more sailing. The core gameplay is very easy, the difficulty in the game comes solely from the fact that sailing back and forth between London and other islands is boring. You want to explore and take risks, which will only cause difficulties. I guess this is a profound statement on the nature of man or something, but it just doesn't make for fun gameplay.\n\nThe best way to play would be to plan the route you're gonna take from London and back in advance, and do not deviate from it. It probably assures you will be safe, but this is boring. Exploring is fun, but if you want to complete the game you should avoid long expeditions. So either you have fun and you die, or you're bored to death by playing it smart. But I have a third option, find some other game in my Steam collection to play.\n\nIt would be nice to be able to record what items are sold at a certain port as well. I don't feel like using actual pen and paper to do it. And resorting to using a wiki is sort of lame.\n\nThe combat system is very simple and not fun either, but I think it's only a minor flaw, since the best bits of Sunless Sea are exploration and the atmosphere. The combat doesn't matter that much.\n\nBonus points for Lipiäinen Point though.","March 5","false","16.4"," 31 of 36 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","31","36","0","0"

The choice of muted greens and grays works to make the rays of lights (whether cast by your ship or emitted from various lighthouses) pop. Cruising in the dark of the Sunless Sea builds a sense of dread and mystery which is appropriate to the theme of the game.\n\nFurthermore, the music, while infrequent, punctuates the mood and builds tension. The spare sound effects, the lapping of the water and the distant ringing of buoys create a soundscape on which your journey unfolds.\n\nMuch of the game takes place in a text window that is inexplicably tiny and stuck to the bottom of the screen. The prose comes in relatively short and disgestible tid-bits, so while much of the game is reading the stories you come across in your voyage, I didn't feel overwhelmed with a wall (or in this case a yard sign) of text at any point.\n\nThe stories themselves are full of mishmashed details and themes, making them far more colorful and dynamic than the graphics of the Sea itself. To me, the highpoint of the game was in unravelling these stories, bringing in various objects discovered along the way to open up new options. Leaving port and returning after a brief delay will advance the stories, so in this way, one can plan a route to satisfy different story requirements and continue to push back the fog of unexplored areas.\n\nThe game describes itself as a Rogue-like, which is partly true, in that some of the islands appear in different locations on each playthrough and there are some that may not be present at all. However, the area around London (the starting port) is always the same and this expanse of sameness can make the Rogue-like description seem like a fib. Death is easy when first learning the game, as it is in many Rogue-likes, so sailing through the same staring area again and again becomes tedious.\n\nThis leads to the first of my two major objections to the game, each shortcoming reinforcing the other.\n\n1) Travel is at a decidedly deliberate pace. While this initially worked to make me savor exploration, as well as building a sense of anticipation or dread as I advanced through a game, the thought of sailing past the same islands that I'd already been to several times in hopes of discovering something new seemed more like a chore and less like fun.\n\nBefore I stopped playing the game altogether, I'd plan out a route and make a loop, visiting some familiar places for resources or to advance a story and (hopefully) uncovering something new on the map. When I'd first began playing, I'd make three or four of these voyages before logging off (Assuming I didn't die). But the thought of just sitting for several minutes at a time, waiting for something to happen made me think I'd be better served quitting and loading up something faster paced after a few play sessions like this.\n\nUntil you've figured out combat (my second objection), it is very easy to wind up dead and have to restart and travel laboriously through regions that are largely unchanged from one game to the next. This makes for far too much travel time for my taste.\n\n2) Combat is horrible.\n\nOkay, I'll write a little more on this.\n\nThe various monsters and pirate ships are imaginatively and effectively rendered in the game. Many of them, however, have a ridiculous number of hit points compared to the damage of any weapon that you will acquire before half the map is explored. That's a lot of traveling and, hence, a lot of game time.\n\nTo make things worse, the sound effects of the cannons are repetitious and obnoxious. When you're fighting a Lifeberg (an enemy that is easily encountered on your first voyage) that has 400 hit points and you're doing 15-20 every shot... not only does the same cannon fire sound grate on the ears, but the combat itself becomes a grind.\n\nWhile there are a very few enemies that seem to be balanced around your starting equipment, it is easy to run into foes that are far stronger. When you add in the very slow rate of resource accrual, it's not hard to wind up behind the firepower curve. When first playing, this can result in many deaths, which equal restarts, which means more tediously slow sailing through regions you know by heart.\n\nOf course, you can avoid most of the fights, but giving foes wide, languid births results in, wait-for-it, even more monotonous, paint-drying travel.\n\nThe foes do, however, break into two types, ones that fires cannon blasts and the other being monsters that simply charge at you. Both of these types can be easily defeated by simply getting right behind them and staying there, shooting and shooting and shooting and... well, you get the point.\n\nSome may describe this sticking to the rear of foes as strategy, but this works with just about everything, is boring and feels like an exploit. However, when stuck with limited resources (food and fuel) and poor weapons, this may be the only choice available.\n\nI really wanted to like Sunless Sea. I hung in because I liked the imaginatively written stories, the murky graphics and the moody sounds, but the molasses slow travel and the totally broken combat forced me to abandon ship. Maybe if this game had spent a little more time in drydock, having it's combat system scrapped altogether or entirely rebuilt and travel sped up above senior citizen meandering, then I'd probably be playing the thing rather than writing this disappointed review.","March 11, 2015","false","18.9"," 48 of 65 people (74%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","74","48","65","0","0"

Play it too.\nIn Sunless Sea, you are the Captain of a ship in a Lovecraftian unter-Zee, a sunless sea beneath the earth.

You are exploring, as the map randomizes (unless you carry over a Zee chart from a previous career) to master things.\n\nCombat is real time and a balance of trying to evade while keeping your enemy in your sights, leading to graceful figure 8's or not so frantic retreats as a giant living iceberg tries to ram you.\n\nAnd it all works, from the delicious writing to the wicked sense of humor permeating it all!","February 6, 2015","true","227.9"," 30 of 35 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","30","35","0","0"

It is incredibly difficult at the beginning without resources, knowledge or cash (or real ways of making cash). The mid-game becomes incredibly easy when you know your trade routes and have learned how to avoid enemies or flee from them reliably. Then, things become incredibly difficult again because the bigger ships require you to relearn everything about fuel and supply consumation.\n\nThe middle-game has a boring challenge-level. But by Salt and by Stone, exploring the wonderful unique vistas and brilliantly crafted islands is simply glorious.\n\nFrom learning the roles of Masks on Visage to finding out where all the postmen of London disappeared to (and where the lost letters and parcels ended up), from visiting the Uttershroom (a semi-sentient fungi colony settled by a few humans) or the majestic court of the King of the Drownies, the setting is a fantastic mix of Victorian Steampunk, a heavy dose of Lovecraft and a very unique and poetic humour.\n\nIt is also the most subversive game. I set out as a good-aligned adventurer in search of riches and love and is now a cannibal arsonist smuggler in a fierce battle over his soul with an entire kingdom made up from monkeys. Apes, actually, but don't call them that.\n\n\nI fear the replay value is not as good as it could be, as there are very few genuinely branching storylines, but what there is is enough content by far to spend quite a long time exploring. My current captain has survived for roughly 20 hours of in-game time now, and I feel like at best I've discovered half of the lore and a quarter of all the secrets, and am not even getting close to fulfilling my Captain's desire of wealth and fortune.\n\n\nI wish ships had more cargo. I wish the officers you hire had more personality and would interact with each other. I wish storylines were more branching. But most of all, I wish to spend a lot more time zailing the Unterzee.\n","February 14, 2015","true","26.1"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","27","30","2","0"

It's what you come here for. Everything from the short snippets of the daily life aboard your Zee-steamer that show up in your logbook, to the stories you find on the Unterzee's numerous islands, is insanely well written. This a world with depth (pun intended), novelty and beautifully realised characters and locales. The gameplay itself, at least outside of combat, moves at a steady and relaxed pace, but the undercurrent of tension is always present. At any time, you have five resources to manage: Your hull (ship's health), fuel, supplies, crew and terror. Lose too many crewmen, or see everyone on your ship go mad with terror, and it's usually the end of your journey. But the game encourages you to take risk. Playing it safe staying in home waters, where the towns are sane and the worst you'll find can be taken out with three cannon shots, will soon leave you starved for the resources you need to survive at sea. No, the game demands you venture forth, into darkness and danger, into tension, risk and reward. When you inevitably die, it's not the end, though. Depending on your preparations, you're able to pass variable amounts of your skills and resources on to your successor, and then the game starts again, a new captain setting out from Fallen London, onto the deep, dark sea.\nEverything about this game is thought through, and if you don't mind reading and playing a slower-paced game, you'll find a bounty of brilliant words and spine chilling tension in Sunless Sea.","February 26, 2015","true","74.4"," 27 of 30 people (90%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","90","27","30","0","0"

It's basically a roguelike.  howEVER.  Sailing from port to port takes an incredibly long time.  The sea is almost empty of things to interact with, which is good because they are mostly punishingly overpowered, but bad because if you actually want combat, it can take 20 minutes to find some.  You can spend an entire day playing this game, and have not advanced yourself enough to have moved up from the baseline boat you start with.\n\nThe game is set such that there is almost no value in trading early on.  Seriously.  Your inital boat has a hold capacity of 40.  One item that you can buy, wine, costs $21  The most it can be sold for normally is $23.  That's $80 per run, when a new ship costs 2000.  You will also need to pay for fuel and food, which runs to about $30.  Also that fuel and food needs to be stored on your boat, further cutting into profits.\n\nOk fine.  We've all played these sailing games before, what about combat, can you make money doing that?  Sure.  After a bunch of trial and error, you will find that there are two boats (The pirate destroyer and the crack pirate destroyer) that are both weak enough to be destroyed by a new player, and reliably have food and fuel to make up for the 5 minutes you spend chasing their tails, as well as some cargo.  The rest?  Well there's a crab that can be killed for 1xp (takes about 200 for a new 'level') or a free, non-transportable meal.  Your crew just ate?  Well, that xp is the best you can hope for.  Bats can be killed for a transportable meal, to be eaten when you, you know, need it.  That's worth about $20, actually a lot of money considering how much you are scraping early on.  Other sea monsters you will find are much too hard to fight. Other pirates have either nothing, or are so high level that instead of food and fuel, you get bolts of silk.  Which can be resold at an eye-watering discount for less than the food and fuel found on a destroyer.\n\nExploring?  Each port you visit will net you a usually small amount of money, and one fuel when you give a report to the admiralty on returning in London.  Generally getting from one port to another requires more than one fuel.  Additionally, the money you make will go to supplies.  So exploring is almost always a net negative.\n\nSo basically your only hope is missions.  There is one character who will send you on fetch quests, basically trading, but with an actually worth-your-time profit margin.  Then there is the mob smuggler, who will give you missions than can lead to instakills, since he sends you out to sea with contraband to a place you may not know how to find.  If you can't find it on the supplies you packed, and return to London you'll have it confiscated (there's equipment for smugglers, but it doesn't fit on the initial boat, and you WILL NOT have a better one at this point in the game).\n\nAnd hey, I get it, resources can be scarce.  There's tons of games like that, from the first Resident Evil to Don't Starve.  But this game plays out so damn SLOWLY.  You boat barely moves in the water, and everything is so far away.  Getting a few hundred dollars together to buy a new gun for your boat can take, and I am in no way exaggerating, HOURS.\n\nIf there were twice the monsters, at half the danger, and the boat moved twice as fast, this would be an amazing game.  As it is, I spent a few days on it, always with the promise that if I stuck out the lame slow start, I'd get to the good stuff.  My hold would get big enough to start trading, my weapons would get good enough to start fighting.  Instead all that ever happens is you slowly burn all your fuel and food, occasionally doing a fetch quest to inject a little more cash into your operation, but always dwindling, until you die.  I die a lot in Super Meat Boy, but that game doesn't make me play three hours for the privilege.\n\nBasically this game smacks of an unfinished alpha, that is somehow inexplicably considered finished.  The early game seems wildly unbalanced, the pace of the game is super slow, and there's not enough things to do and interact with, especially since interacting with things usually involves money you don't have (either pure cost, fuel, food, crewmen that need replacing or hull repairs)","December 12, 2015","false","27.9"," 55 of 79 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","55","79","3","2"

As I enjoyed Fallen London I had really high expectations.\n\nUnfortunately I just do not think there is an actual game here. There is a lot of great and really funny content and while I enjoyed the stories and the dialogue which I did manage to encounter the majority of the content is locked behind what is actually very poor gameplay.  All the game actually entails is sailing, really, really slowly between ports with the occasional equally boring "sea-combat" thrown in.\n\nAt the moment the gameplay feels like it was added an afterthought to "gate" the access to the actual content, the same way Fallen London has a number of actions which regenerate over time. Or it becomes fun a lot later.\n\nI am trying to come up with some constructive advice on how to make this actually fun and the only thing I can come up with is making this more of a horror game, and less rogue-like.\n* increasing the difficulty of the fights to make the sea-monsters or pirates scarier to encounter\n* making the sea monsters more aggressive\n* decreasing the sight range and adding sonar\n\nTraversing the zee could then be about sneaking quietly between ports, putting lights out and listening for the sonar pings. etc. Terror feels shouldn't solely be a resource that you handle in game but something the player gets involved with.\n\nThis game aims to trivialise dying when what it should be doing is creating a sense of attachment to each individual captain.\n\nGaaargh, I've never written any reviews but I find this game so infruriating. /rantOver\n","February 2, 2015","false","5.7"," 43 of 59 people (73%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","73","43","59","2","0"

Where to start.\n\nSince on the whole I adore this game, I'll start with my problems with it, to be absolutely fair.\n\nMy biggest, most serious issue is that the game is INCREDIBLY GRINDY. Incredibly grindy, and you can die very easily and lose all that progress. I understand that a small ship wouldn't reasonably do very good business trying to transport goods, but for god's sake, I should be able to make more than a $1 profit on anything I buy to sell (if that!). Either that, or you should have the option to pass on your ship to your progeny, and they can keep the money they would otherwise spend on that ship. As for how easy it is to die; once an enemy has you up to nearly full visibility, it's nearly impossible to get back down to a level where you can safely attack. From there it's just a matter of time before it tears your crew apart.\n\nThe other issue I take is that you can run out of fuel close to a port but not docked in it and have to lose the game that way. Surely, you could hire someone to come tow your ship (and if you're out of money, THEN you're dead). Perhaps only certain ports can tow ships. Something. Perhaps you could abandon ship into a small rowing vessal, attempt to get to port, and then from there perhaps have to owe somebody something. The most frustrating defeats I've suffered have been floating uselessly while touching shore. Very. Frustrating.\n\nI would also add that this game is rather poorly tutorialized. It tells you what you need, but it won't give you any real tips or guidance about the safest way to navigate the zee, given that you only have so much fuel and so much food. An early run isn't going to last very long because it's nearly impossible to know just where you need to go and when, and then any grinding done is lost.\n\nHowever, I only say these things because I love the game, and I wouldn't want to give someone any false hopes. God knows the zee would only crush them.\n\nIf you're not scared off yet, though, there is a sort of ruthlessness to the game that makes me want to beat it into submission. Coupled with a haunting atmosphere and horrors that are very effective at knowing the line between "unnerving" and "over-the-top-cheesy", Sunless Sea is genuinely a game that intimidates me. I get chills when I have to leave port, since there is a very deep uncertainty that I'll ever be returning.  The art is incredible, the music is catchy (and at times gives me the same fright I get at the Sonic drowning music), and the writing is well worth crossing the seven seas for.\n\nLong story short, if you bore easily but are very into Lovecraftian horror, wait for a sale. If you're willing to put in long, hard, heartbreaking hours for a game that will sometimes honor you with a very delicious crumb from time to time, welcome aboard.","October 15, 2014","true","156.5"," 30 of 37 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","30","37","0","0"

It has lovely influences, and on rare occasion, lovely player-driven moments. I just wish it would focus on that. Instead, I suggest you keep a show or book handy during most of your playtime, and you should definitely abuse manual saves. I realized this far too late.\n\nThe writing is better than average for a videogame, but you shouldn't play this game for the writing. You'll spend most of your time watching a ship move at a glacial pace across the map on a leg of one of your necessary trade routes. Without money, you are very much at sea, and that will end poorly. So you'll grind. You'll find your preferred trade route, and move goods from one port to the next for a profit that might be grand in the real world, but isn't here.\n\nAs an additional note, the best stories come from making poor decisions. This makes sense to some degree (danger and insanity tend to make things a bit more thrilling), but suffering through these options often means you're already set for death.

Unfortunately, it's almost impossible to enjoy the progress to keep your ship and crew alive in the sunless economy. Because everything you need are so expensive, and you can only pay them via some few profitable lines terminated at London, your journey would become an endless London-to-somewhere routine and only at few times you can forget them and sail up to other exciting unexplored islands, as a real captions would do. This intolerable fact was discovered when I suddenly found that I spent hours in game to hunt bat swarms repeatedly, because it provides the cheapest supplies and the way to comfort crews' terrors. Trust me, it's suck to see your great journey become a journey of a bat killer, who acts like the poorest bagger to appreciate every coins given by the game system, which performs no economy mechanism but to sell expensive goods to players.\n\nAnother problem is you can only keep relations with NPCs during the story lines are opened. After that, they disappeared. You would find that after completing your jobs to convoy them from islands to islands, and enjoy the interactions with them, they would be vaporized at the final stop. Nothing continues the stories while they're actually too short for a game whom should beat other brainless 3D engine demos with great stories, and soon you're wasting your time on the supply and fuel problems again.\n\nAnd the officers: while they should be your best friends who would accompany you till the end of game, they're actually only portraits. Yes, you can 'speak to them with secrets' to gain some skill upgrading, and try to waste your most precious supply to talk with them. However, they would only give you the standard NPC answers, almost like the famous arrow-in-the-knee. The boring bill-paying routines make things worse, since that means you can almost find no chances to discovery their stories when you need to travel from London to London to sell whatever profitable and report ports to the administration to earn the money. As a result, they're aboard with silence, keep silent, and also die silently with your crew and the whole ship, when you earn no enough money to reduce terrors or pay bills for fuels and supplies. They are nothing like your truly friends in Baldur's Gate or Planescape: Torment, which let you enjoy the game with NPCs' most tiny requests, lies, emotions, choices, stories and their deaths and lives.\n\nFinally, the terrors: I think it's a really terrible thing in the game. Because you would find it's the most expensive goods to buy and the supply is even fewer than others. You can basically reduce your 1 terror with 10+ Echos, but it's so easy to be stockpiled when you're sailing on the zee. It increases rapidly while you leave shore far enough, and would stop increasing while you sail along with coasts. However, it never reduces even when you anchoring in the brightest port, unless you spend *lots of* money to buy drinks at the local taverns, if they exists. Only London provide you to reduce terrors to 50 every times you stop at the port. However, it would add your Nightmare's Strength with no cure. This basically tell you your next travel may explode because the terror would burst with the event to confront the nightmare.\n\nSo, what would you get with your $18.99? A game should become the next Fallout with the rich stories and characters, screws up with the terrible economy system and the pale NPCs and events. As an early access game I think it exposed some fatal defects that should be fixed as soon as possible, or it would be a sunk ship under the sunless zee.","August 3, 2014","false","31.2"," 41 of 56 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","41","56","0","0"

Talking rodents, the undead, a lot of bats and giant sea monsters make it a constant adventure. At current review (9/27) the new real-time on-map combat system has not been implemented yet, but that should take the gameplay to a different level.\n\nCurrently the combat system takes place in a new window where you enter in 'strategies', four at a time, with specific cool downs on each. The 'visibility' system is really slick though, where you do damage based on how illuminated your enemy is compared to your own (firing flares, carefully observing, etc.), and I hope it is implemented in a similar way with the real time system.\n\nExploration is genuinely fun and rewarding, as navigating around the various entities that occupy the Zee and finding new islands seems to play a significant part in the overall experience. Managing Terror (morale), supplies, fuel, cargo, your crew, Officers (and their skills), ship equipment, and new hulls all add different gameplay strategies. Trade is a major way to improve your Echo (currency) wallet, and it really pays off to ship different cargo to very distant locations.\n\nYou will die. You will die a lot. But that's just part of the game. You can preserve different things on death, but it helps to think that the end is nigh every time you leave Fallen London. You'll have a much more enjoyable time.","September 27, 2014","true","15.7"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","28","34","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smiledozer/recommended/304650/","Smiledozer","*IC* Smiledozer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Smiledozer/","484 products in account","Sunless Sea is a Lovecraftian epic. It is poetry in motion. It is...difficult to explain.\n\nWith an eerie backdrop of an underground sea, mysterious sea monsters, pirates, and ominous signs of a growing evil, Sunless Sea drags you in and drops you down into the depths of a beautiful yet disturbing world. All this is put to a backdrop of a great soundtrack which haunts your waking dreams. Ever since the full release of this game it has haunted me. It is not a horror-themed gamed, rather it is simply a disturbing tale. The story itself echoes that of Joseph Conrad's 'Heart of Darkness' and ironically the devs put a quote from the writer in the opening loading sequence.\n\nThe game itself involves a lot of reading, and so if you aren't a fan of reading, you might consider watching a broadcast first. But the lore and mythos behind this gem of a game is the best part. It is considered the sequel to the online text-based game Fallen London. What is the story of the main character? What does he want? What will he do to get what he wants?....Well that's up to you. This game is one of my personal favorites, which I ended up following from it's Early Access Opening to it's Official Launch. It is oddly addicting and hard to describe. But Lovecraftian sums it all up in a nice package with a bow on top.\n\nPros:\n- One of the most original stories that I have ever seen in a video game. It is mostly text-based, but this adds to the spookiness, as you're left with your own imagination to picture the things you've seen in the Neath.\n- Map randomization at the beginning of every new Character play through ensures interesting replay value.\n- Beautiful, Indie style graphics that mezmorize at some points\n- A Challenge. It is difficult, but the more you die, the more you progress.\n- Amazing soundtrack that adds to the tension and feeling of naval exploration.\n- Interesting and highly original characters.\n- Interesting fighitng system (It has changing several times since its inception)\n- "Merciful Mode" allows for an easier play, allowing the player to save manually. When you first start a new game, "Merciful Mode" will be turned off. This makes a nice, difficult game for those of you who think they can hack it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    mmmmm\n- Choose your fate...everything you do, results in something else, good or evil.\n\nCons:\n- The ship you use in the beginning drags along a bit. Until your first upgrades, it is very slow and therefore makes the game seem slow.\n- Your character tends to die often, forcing you to repeat your predecessor's actions (Unless you can grant a will)\n- There isn't a soundtrack that comes with it. I really like the OST.\n- The Dawn Machine.\n\nVerdict?\n\n8/10 - Sunless Sea is an incredible experience. If you enjoy reading, especially Lovecraft, Poe, Barker, or anything of the horror-suspence genre, you will love this game. The obsurdity, terror, and tension you will feel in this game is pretty incredible. You will also be forced to make dozens of decisions which will affect your game and character. Think on it before you buy. Do you like to read? Yes? Buy. No? Probably not your cup of tea. I also highly recommend to those who are open minded about video games.","February 20, 2015","true","291.7"," 29 of 36 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","29","36","4","1"

It is a world filled with horror, if that is what you take with you. It is a realm filled with wonder and beauty, if such is the domain of the mind. Sailing on the wide black zee can be tranquil or terrifying.

Grinding seems to be the only way to keep up with fuel needs and it takes all of the fun out of exploring because it is punishing to your supplies. Your terror meter ( or at least mine) is constantly headed towards full and trying to manage it will just destroy what lil stock you have in your fuel resources. If there is a tipping point due to upgrades where there is a bit more leeway in the survival aspect, I never made it there. I either was bored to tears from going back and forth to the same locations or biteing my nails wondering if I would even make it home and if I did I get rewarded 30 some odd echoes barely enough to restart a grind session.  Possible suggestion larger fuel guage, slight increase in currency exchange and adjust the terror aspect. As much as I want a suspense filled, difficult game, when I die I want to feel the urge to dive back in! Some more reward from the time I just spent running head long to my ineviatable end would also be more reassuring. This creates the hope of that 1 out of 5 runs where you finally really crush it, get some epic upgrades and then tragically die to some totally unforseen sea monster leaving you mad but proud you died an adventures life. Sunless Sea just never allowed me to get there, now either I'm an epic fail at adventuring or there still needs to be some adjustments. However,this game still might be for some people and it has a lot of promise but in the end in this state it leaves me wanting.","January 15, 2015","false","10.0"," 70 of 109 people (64%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","64","70","109","6","0"

The sense of discovery, especially on your first few voyages, is unparalleled.\n\nThis all led me, in the first 40 or so hours of playing, to think Sunless Sea might be one of my favorite games ever.\n\nBut I gradually started realizing I wasn't actually getting anywhere in the game, and that I wasn't GOING TO get anywhere in the game unless I kept grinding, AND GRINDING, AND GRINDING, AND GRINDING, AND GRINDING...............\n\nI like hard games.

You will probably find yourself revolving around, trying to figure out wth are you suppose to do, scrounging for fuel and supplies. However, once you've reached a certain point in game, when you actually know what to do, the real game starts. I honestly can't remember when was the last time I've spent 5 hours in a single game session.  I even started making my own notes about where I can buy specific wares, at which port. I do realise tho, that there are easier ways to do this, but where's the fun in that?\nNevertheless, its a cruel world out there. The game expects you to die. I mean literally, it wants you dead, and you know its true when you realise that most of the achievements refers to dying. There are various ways to die in this game, it can be an awfull contingency that can jeopardize the whole game, or some creature that will one-shot you from a distance. If you thought dying in dark souls is the worst thing that can happen, you are clearly a landlubber. In here, you can easily lose hours of gameplay in a single slip up, which forces you to stay sharp the whole time. Of course there are ways to ease your death with heritage system and stuff like that, but you will always suffer some loss.\nOverall, I highly recommend this game for everyone who digs that kind of climate, or just seek for a well-written rpg.","May 9","true","32.0"," 16 of 16 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","16","16","0","0"

Game is hard and unforgiving as it is, lengthening the distance to London, your home port, would make it even harder. Maybe if combat would be more profitable/complex, it wouldn't feel so tedious, which leads to my next point.\n- Combat is really simple:\nIt comes down to pressing a button whenever your weapon is ready to attack, or a bit earlier for a faster shot with a slight miss chance, kiting sea creatures, and staying behind enemy ships. Furthermore, early through mid game engaging in combat is not worth the fuel, resources and risk involved given how little profit you can get, and is really only usefull to reduce your crew's terror while at sea.\n-Earning echoes(in game currency) is slow:\nI see a lot of people complaining about the grinding. I must say, you're doing it wrong. Most quests don't yield a single echo, instead, they usually pay you with merchandise, which you can sell, trade, or use for further quests. This is were it gets controversial. If you sell these quest/special items, you can earn a really quick buck, usually enough to get a really good ship relatively fast. However, if you want the best ship, this is really not enough, and the grinding game starts, usually with trade routes, and given that merchandise value does not fluctuate with time, or even between playthroughs, they are always the same routes, which gives the "grindy" feeling.\n-Reading the game story is slow.\nAnd its really what makes the whole exploration thing worthwhile, its amazingly well written, and really pushed me to try and find every story in the game. However, after 66 hours, I think I've found most (so technically, feels like I have finished it), and given the earlier points I wrote, it gets boring, but every single-player game does after a finite amount of time after you finish it, eh. :v\nTl,dr: Buy game if you're patient and  like: -> reading <-, so if you just skipped to tldr because you're impatient or lazy, its probably not a game for you, lol.\n","November 29, 2015","true","76.3"," 25 of 32 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","25","32","0","0"

Sadly, it was not enough for me.\n\nBecause everything else is massively tedious. The combat is really weak, a matter of gaming the terrible AI (enemy ships can't fire behind them, and they don't know how to go into reverse...just get behind them and blast away) and not much else. If you want to get anything done the game expects you to grind like crazy, because every quest seems to use large amounts of rare items.\n\nAnd finally, although the writing IS excellent, it suffers from a bizarre flaw: let's say you built up your relationship with a certain officer enough to steal the secrets of the Masters of the Bazaar themselves, and you used this forbidden knowledge to build an arcane engine. Later you retire. The next captain will be offered the opportunity to do the exact same things!

If you brought Edgar Allen Poe forward in time, cheered him up a bit, and taught him how to make videogames, and he had somehow become British and acquired a deadpan sense of humor, you'd get this game. I've been part of the backer beta, and I've loved it. Just be aware of what you're getting into:\nA living novel. This is not a magazine or Twitter, something you read for 15 minutes and toss aside. You create your hero and then send him/her/it through a novel. And then you send that protagonist's heir, and the heir's heir. The locations, dangers, and other characters stay the same (though shifting in place & time), but the story adapts to your hero's decisions and skills. Even if you played a "perfect" game, you would see only a fraction of the 250,000 words.\nA survival adventure, not a trading simulator or combat game. You're going to spend your first captains' lives figuring out how to deal with the uncertainties of the sea in a fragile ship with limited space for fuel, food, and cargo. Don't waste your time trying to trade your way to wealth or attacking even medium-level enemies. Sneak your way from port to port, expand your map, accept some quests, and bring back reports and intelligence to the powers in Fallen London.\nAn (a)morality simulator. Once you've acquired a better gun, engine, and ship, and you've hired a slate of officers, you can stop worrying about moment-to-moment survival. That's when your stated goal, to secure your own posterity (through wealth or adventure or finding your father), starts competing with your hero's moral sense. There is an island with bees that make the most delicious honey from the minds of innocent victims. You can make so much money if you just kidnap a random stranger, and perhaps sacrifice a couple of crew ... and moreover, if you don't, you cut yourself off from quite a bit of content. Maybe your street urchin heroine will sail away at the first hint of human cost ... and maybe her son, the fallen priest, will give into his curiosity. There are dozens of decisions, large and small, and so many stories that emerge from them; and your character can gradually influence the fates of factions and nations.\nA community. I submitted a lot of bugs to Sunless Sea during the beta, some of them more opinion than bug, and every one of them was addressed. In the course of Early Access, the makers completely redesigned a near-complete feature of the game (the combat) from scratch, because their players told them it had to change. They've added sooo much content, especially over the past few weeks, and there is still major content coming. The forums are very active, and the main dev often responds directly to questions and suggestions. The game is also a companion piece to their free browser game, Fallen London: same lore and voice, very different narrative and mechanics. There's just so much depth here.\n\nTo sum up, be ready for a very different game. Look beyond min/maxing and super-strategizing to win. Don't beat the game -- play your captain, and read the novel, and you should have a wonderful time.","February 8, 2015","true","215.6"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","83","19","23","4","1"

This was not one of them. It had to die, if indeed it could be said to be living. It was a sacrifice not of its own choosing, but of something vast and compelling that had chosen for it. Had chosen for me. There were things I needed. Things I needed to know. Colours of memory and secrets that burn.\n\nFar from my birth on the street I rested in my manse, contemplating a life of luxury, filled with light. No longer fearing each time we turned from the shore that we would be swallowed whole by the dark. No more red feasts. No more nights haunted by The Eye. No more hard choices. No more regrets.\n\nFrom the frozen temple of Whither to the weeping stones of the Salt Lions I traveled. Laden down with the great treasures of the Tomb Colony of Venderbight and multi-hued scintillack from the Principles, the ship sped through the calm waters of the Unterzee. Above the deck, the enormous heart of something old and vicious and clever, dripping irrigo blood through the netting that held it. A king's ransom, gathered at great risk and expense from all corners of the Neath. The price agreed upon for the life of a nightmare. A thing. A friend.\n\nThere are mistakes that cannot be undone.

Not only is it difficult to explore the Unterzee and learn it's secrets, it's hard enough as it is to merely survive and get by with your meager funds. In addition, the story developed as you play is both captivating and intriguing, with an overall sense of despair, cruelty and terror. If you enjoy games of unforgiving and relentless challenge and or deep, mysterious storyline, Sunless Sea is perfect for you. 10/10 it's only going to get better as the updates are released.","December 24, 2014","true","58.9"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","17","20","0","0"

It is full of dark, beautiful, sometimes funny, sometimes disturbing prose. Sailing on the zee, the underground sea where the game takes place, is a dark, beautiful, lonely, and sometimes dangerous experience.\n\nThe tone of this game reminds me a bit of the Welcome to Night Vale podcast. The game consists of a library of small stories. Some are filled with terror, some with humor, and many are a mixture of the two.\n\nThe stories advance when you are in various ports. It can be a bit hard to keep track of where you’re at in various storylines and it’s not always clear what will happen if you select an action. However, the former seems appropriate for a game base around exploring various storylines instead of one single overarching story. The latter is probably appropriate for a game where terror lurks around every corner.\n\nExpect to die, probably in a terrible way. Your next game will probably go better. There’s more to do than any one zee captain can manage, and a new life will let you explore a different path. Do you want to be a monster hunter? A spy? A smuggler? There are a few different paths you can take.\n\nIf you are looking for a game based around trading resources, or where the focus is on strategic zee warfare, or where you don’t have to read a lot, this game probably isn’t for you. This is a game about storytelling and exploration and it is lovely.","February 6, 2015","true","203.5"," 17 of 20 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","17","20","0","0"

On 14.2% people get an Ironclad Will, which is pretty much necessary to survival (no one with any equipment would go without one) and is cheap to boot. Only 19.6% get 10 Admiralty Favour (i.e. visited 10 ports). 14.1% discovered the Dawn Sun Machine (which is directly south of Fallen London at the bottom of the map). 0.9% have completed the game.\n\nSo what we see is tons of people abandoning the game despite the many positive things in its favor and virtually no one completing it.\n\nThe game does a great job of being an atmospheric exploration and story-driven game with a smidgin of combat (which is almost always avoidable). The creepy setting of Fallen London is fantastic and the many storylets start out as intriguing.\n\nBut it just does too many things wrong to provide enough fun for most gamers.\n\n- It feels overly difficult to earn money for upgrades. The first likely ship upgrade costs $3,000 and when you struggle to break stay above a few hundred, that seems impossibly far away.\n- Paradoxically, there's not much reason (other than cargo space) to upgrade  your ship. You can carry better guns and more crew but....you can avoid fighting everything in the game so those upgrades are sometimes hard to justify.\n- You are extremely limited on cargo space unless you upgrade to the $7,000 merchant ship. Sailing around the Zee often means you stock up on 15+ fuel and 10+ food, so 30 of your 40 cargo spots are gone right there. Many random quests require bits and bobs (5 coffee here, 3 wines there, 2 candles here) but you're loathe to carry them around "just because". Which means extra sailing back and forth across the Zee to micro-optimise your cargo.\n- Sailing around the Zee becomes tedious after a while once you've explored it a fair amount and are trying to complete quests. I often had the window open in the background while I surfed the web, waiting to get somewhere.\n- Leveling up feels extremely slow -- even after 10+ hours of play my stats are so low that the vast majority of challenges have a less than 50% chance of success.\n- The rogue-like death mechanic sort of but doesn't quite work because the stories aren't interesting enough to replay/re-read. You'll find yourself speeding through them with subsequent captains just to get the loot.\n\nWhen I look at those, the common thread is that the pacing feels off. The ship upgrades don't feel well paced. The stat upgrades don't feel well paced. The quests don't feel well paced, where you often need to sail around quite a lot for meager rewards. The overall world exploration doesn't feel well paced to the plot/quests. You'll have explored the entire map before you've made any substantial progress toward your main quest.\n\nAfter fifteen hours of play I just don't feel like I've got enough from the game other than cool atmospherics.","February 8","false","18.1"," 22 of 29 people (76%) found this review helpful","76","22","29","0","0"

I bought it in Early Access back in July and find myself still coming back to it and spending HOURS wandering the dark Unterzee... Every trip I make, every route I try, it never feels as though I am simply following a predetermined plotline, but rather constructing my own adventure as I see fit (There are endgame Ambitions, if you wish, but you don't HAVE to follow them). And more than that, I am never simply going to 'zee to sell goods or kill monsters in a monotonous grind. New threads of storyline are constantly streaming over the decks of my ship, setting me out into the world to discover the impossible colors of the Neath, establish a secret spy network in a rival nation's ports, negotiate an exchange between the factions of Hell itself. No voyage is ever boring.\n\nBeyond the stories (of which there are so, SO many), the artwork and atmosphere of Sunless Sea are simply incredible. The first time you cruise past some of the more elaborately detailed islands (I'm looking at you, Frostfound and Kingeater's Castle) you may very well cry. Well, maybe not cry, but you should be impressed. The first time you accidentally zail over that enormous Eye (yes, the one in the trailer), you may very well do something undignified, especially if you happen to be playing in the dark with the music turned up while wearing headphones (not that I did that, of course, but DAMN that was surprising...)\n\nTo summarize: This game is hard. HARD. When first starting out, the most basic elements of managing Fuel, Supplies, and Terror will be nearly more than you can handle. But, after you've accidentally drowned, starved, or mutinied a few good Captains to death, these will become easier. Then the challenge becomes leaving the comforting shores of London and zailing East into the great unknown, where large monsters and angry pirates will try very hard to kill you some more. But that's where the fun lies; in exploring the wide, dark Unterzee and discovering the stories therein. You will make hard choices. You will learn strange things. You will discover magnificent locations. If you enjoy dark humor, strange lore, and immersive RPG exploration, this is a game for you.\n\nLose your mind. Eat your crew.

It is a really great setting, great visuals, and a really unique neat idea, which is all window dressing to a what amounts to bad, clunky gameplay. I saw the game as an exploring game, with some combat, resource management, trading and basic RPG elements thrown in, like Lovecraft does Pirates. Instead it just ends up being a frustrating confusing incoherent mess. None of the parts really work. Combat is awkward, which is unfortunate, because you get in it A LOT, or are spending all your time avoiding it, which wastes so many resources, which would not be a problem if there were other ways to get them, but you are out of supplies and fuel often before you are out of the first area of the setting. Trade is nonexistent, or rare, and exploration would seem great, but I am so busying JUST TRYING TO GET TO THE NEXT ISLAND, that I can't really enjoy it. Perhaps there is some underlying strategy I am missing, but if there is, it would have to be very convuluted and elusive. I know it is heading towards its final release, but I can't see the developers addressing the clunky gameplay by February. Even after purchasing its early release and funding its kickstarter, I will have to pass on this one.","January 20, 2015","false","15.5"," 31 of 46 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","31","46","0","0"

The opportunities for trade tend to offer very little return on investment, the combat is slow and predictable with little rewards, the quests that do offer some cash tend to randomly become unavailable and even putting the fastest engine on your ship still progresses you at a snails pace.

It's unique, creative, and unafraid to push boundries. The only potentially negative point I've found is that the pacing is a bit slow. It takes a good while to build up enough to really get out there and explore. Don't get me wrong, you can explore right away but it's highly unlikely you'll make it back to port if venturing out unprepared.\n\nThe game centers around being a zee captain in a vast, dark, underground sea. You travel from port to port trying to make money and (possibly) completing whatever destiny you chose at the beginning. The suspense comes while trying to balance resupply options for fuel and food (to avoid cannabalism), keeping your crew's terror level to a minimum (to prevent mutiny), and avoiding pirates and zee creatures.\n\nSunless Sea is chock full of bizzare story lines, puzzles, and unusual characters in what I could best describe as being a schizophrenic's nightmare.

Though I have barely scratched the surface of it as its pace is deliberate, what you are looking at is essentially an interactive choose-your-own-adventure.  Wait, don't go!  This isn't a bad thing at all and you may wish to stick around to see why.\n\nFirst off, if you are familiar with the browser game, Fallen London, then you will feel right at home; otherwise, if you're on the fence, I would recommend you go sign up and play a little bit of it to get a good idea of what Sunless Sea has in store for you (and it's worth it because it's free).  Essentially, Sunless Sea shares a lot with the mechanics of Fallen London - that is to say that you will spend most of your time going to places and doing interesting things - but the main difference is that you now have a little ship and must sail the darkness of the unterzee.  Unter-whatnow?\n\nThe short of it is that at some point in time, London fell underground, among a few other cities, and is now surrounded by a vast subterranean saltwater abyss known as the unterzee, home of zee-monsters, tomb-colonists, and a whole other slew of Lovecraftian nightmares.  Unlike Fallen London, which mostly keeps your feet planted on the ground, Sunless Sea puts you in the role of a Zee Captain (one of many - this is a roguelike, after all), charged with exploring the darkness and discovering all of its secrets.  Well, small correction there - you can actually select your current captain's ambition, which doesn't necessarily mean "explore everything".\n\nThroughout the game, you will make your way from place to place, discovering ports, creatures, horrors, and whatever else, all told through wonderfully-crafted prose.  The basic nature of it is that in each location, you will be able to start 'stories' or 'storylets' that play out like a choose-your-own-adventure, but not all are self-contained.  Often, by completing certain story sections, you will gain 'traits' that can describe anything from basic supplies to fragments of information.  You'll need these to earn money and other traits that will help you along with other stories you discover, but precious fuel and food is always short in supply and pricey to boot.  You need these, of course, to manage your ship which is your main means of transportation and also your only avatar, but fear not - it has cannons!\n\nMarking this game away from Fallen London proper is the exploration component in which you actively sail and manage your ship and crew, fighting off dangers and discovering new places and things.  While the browser game has the benefit of always-updated and changing content, there is more than enough buried in Sunless Sea to keep you occupied until the next expansion pack.  That being said, the game moves at a deliberate and relaxed pace, but make no mistake that this is a simple walk in the park - tension exists in the form of hostile things, and the further away you sail from London, the more dangerous it gets.\n\nAs such, there is a bit of a grind element to the game, but it is a rogue-like, after all, in the sense that if your captain dies, he or she isn't coming back.  However, there is the saving grace that should you survive long enough to author a will, you can pass a lot off (including the map you've explored) to the next captain.  But, of course, you still have to grind that new guy up just like you did the last one, so repetitiveness will inevitably sink in without someone constantly writing new stuff behind the scenes.\n\nThat being said, if you really enjoy discovery and have an active imagination, then this game will delight you, especially if you have any inclination towards Lovecraftian-style writing.  The world of Sunless Sea and indeed Fallen London is not a rose-tinted one; it is grim, foreboding, yet darkly humorous and whimsical at the same time.\n\nYou won't hear a single word spoken in this one - it's all text driven, accompanied by haunting tunes and the constant hum of your ship engines chugging away at the black below, but if you let yourself sink into this world, you'll come to love it just like its parent game.","February 10, 2015","true","8.2"," 15 of 18 people (83%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","83","15","18","0","0"

You are one of a legacy of captains doomed with wanderlust to sail the underground sea, er... zee, in an effort to find your father's bones, or too become rich, or to amass a collection of artifacts. These goals get you started, but the real meat of the game comes with the writing and scenarios you encounter at each and every port.  The underground sea is home to a collection of civilizations carved out of the bones of previous civilizations, where you may encounter talking rats at war with regal guinea pigs, or the tomb colonists of Vederbight who have died but not stopped walking or talking.\nThe game itself is beautiful and well paced. The tension comes in the cat and mouse way that combat takes form. If you can keep the enemy (ship, crab, thing, etc...) in your sights, and you can keep them illuminated, then you can take aim and fire.  If you turn your lights off, you can effectively avoid an enemy, but at the cost of rising terror.\n\nTerror.  The terror mechanic is interesting. The farther from home waters you go, the farther from the shore you are, you gain terror.  Too much terror and your crew may rebel, or worse.  This introduces a risk/reward factor that keeps you safe if you stay in lighted areas or near the shore, but this will almost always cost you in fuel and supplies.  There is an elegant balance to the resources you have that finds you making hard decisions.  Do I pare down my crew to use fewer supplies on long journeys, allowing me to add more fuel and cargo?\n\nThe quasi-randomized map adds to the intrigue.  I say "quasi randomized" because certain landmarks and ports will always be in the same relative areas, but not in the same locations when one captain dies and another takes to the sea (unless you bequeath them your zee-chart, that is).\n\nWith it's spectacular writing, beautiful design and elegant mechanics, this is an early contender for my game of the year.\n\nNow, hopefully the soundtrack goes on sale soon.","February 6, 2015","true","37.1"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Look: the lights of home fade into the darkness.\n\nThe darkness encloses you in infinite possibilities. Some slumber beneath the water. Some, more worryingly, wake. But the ship sails on.\n\nSunless Sea isn't quite about exploration, nor is it entirely about combat. It seems to be about a certain mood--something wistful, melancholy, and beautiful all at once. There are wonders out here, yes, but the warmth of home is far away. It's one of the most atmospheric games I've ever played, and can in the space of a few hours be horrifying, beautiful, heartbreaking, and surprisingly funny.\n\nIt's also immensely difficult. You will die. A lot. And though you can carry over certain things between characters with a Legacies (you get at least one, and can earn more), it's still possible to LOSE a legacy. But these deaths give the game a lot more weight. You find yourself connecting with your characters and your randomized world more, and you can pick different choices in a second--or third--or fourth--playthrough.\n\nWhile the game is a lot more balanced in favor of the player than it was a few months ago (thank God), be aware that it'll still probably be tweaked a bit more over the course of 2015.\n\nTL;DR: get the thing. Also, stock up on food and fuel. Being alone at sea in a ship that can't move, with a crew that can't eat...well, goodness. You would be in quite the pickle, wouldn't you?

As a lot of other players have stated the writing is fantastic, I've played 20 hours of this game in the last several days. But I think to get the rest of the stories in the game I'm just going to watch a Let's Play while I play something more fun.\n\nThe minute-to-minute play is just so boring, most of your time is spent going in between islands not doing anything. In a story-driven game it is just unbearable to have to grind money to be able to actually progress in items and ships. In twenty hours of gameplay (in merciful mode after dieing twice) I have only upgraded my ship to the Corvette and gotten a few upgrades. Most of my time is spent traveling in between ports and unlocking the different little stories piece by piece until I get too burned out by the travel time to continue.\n\nThe combat is terrible, the rogue-like aspects are poorly thoughtout. I feel like this game should have 2 completely seperate modes. A Story Mode, where the rogue-like elements are cut out and it's much easier to progress in ship and upgrades and you can just relax and enjoy the stories as you go. And then a Rogue-like mode, where they add all of the randomization of islands, cut out the story completely except for random events, and add more enemies to fight with perhaps some form of strategy to the combats instead of just trading hits until someone dies.\n\nIn spite of the tremendous writing, I just can't recommend this game. I think the gameplay is just too boring, and worse, it takes too long to grind any kind of money so the boring gameplay is even more obvious because you have to do too much of it to get the awesome writing. Makes me really sad because I wanted to love this game. Revamp the combat system entirely please and tone down on the grind and this game could be expanded on like forever...\n\n","February 26","false","46.1"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

Early on I watched some lets play (about 6 months before release) and this game looked cool from those videos.  Then it came out and I got to play it for myself.\n\nMy impressions from the videos is that the game took place in an undersea area where spooky things happened.  You were a trader / adventuer.   You would explore for goood trade routes and ocassionaly do certain kinds of quests.\n\nThe reality is quite different.\n1.  You do not really trade.  You are not finding good prices in one port and finding a destination port to sell things for profit.  In fact making money in this game is incredibly hard (any decent amount).   Basically there are a few repetable quests that can make you a fair chunk of change.  These get boring and tedious as you spend so much of your time doing nothing but slowly saling around.  Even this might be OK, except that these repetable quests dry up after a few runs.  I have found 3 of them and all three of them go away after several runs.\n\n2.  The questing is somewhat abitrary on what quests you get and even then, there is very little information given.  For example, someone wants a certain kind of object.  Where you would aquire such an object is NOT given, nor is any kind of reward information.  You may end up doing a quest like this, and get a trivial reward that is totally not worth the effort.\n\nBaiscally this game is a long, dull, grind to get anything done.  Even if you decide to take up piracy, which is at least somewhat interesting, the rewards are random and 95% complete junk.  You take out some other ship, take some damage which is expensive to repair and for your effort you get a single bottle of wine (which isn't worth jack).\n\nAgain, I am completly stumped as to why people actually like this game.","February 8, 2015","false","12.0"," 76 of 134 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","76","134","3","0"

In about 2 hours of playing I've racked up about a dozen restarts, and I don't think I've had a single game last more than about fifteen minutes.  You'll constantly encounter enemies which can effortlessly outmanouver, outshoot, and outrun you, while your ship wallows through the turns like a pregnant water buffalo and your deck gun seems to be incapable of hitting anything outside of point blank range.\n\nWhich would be fine, if there were ways to avoid combat, or if there were some reward for being victorious.  Except there isn't; the combat stands firmly between you and the rest of the game.\n\nThere are enemies that make hamburger out of you every single direction you go from the starting location, and even if you get lucky and beat one of the bad guys, they respawn every time you hit port, and the minor salvage you get from them doesn't even remotely make up for the cost in fuel, supplies, and repairs in fighting them.  Turning off the deck lamp, while supposedly making you less visible, doesn't have any noticeable effect, and even starting with the 'stealth' background, turning off the lamp, and kicking on the engine-damaging overstoking isn't enough to get you past any of the enemies with any degree of reliability. Avoiding them doesn't work, going toe-to-toe doesn't work, trying to kite them has about a 50% chance of winning the fight, but you almost always take at least one hit and don't have the money to fully repair, meaning you're basically hosed on the next fight (which you'll have to deal with, because of the respawning).\n\nI want to believe that there's a great story and fun experience in there somewhere, and I'd really love to be able to rate this game based on those instead of the horrible combat and terrible ship handling, unfortunately, the combat is incredibly frustrating, prohibitively difficult, absolutely unavoidable, and is currently standing between me and the rest of the game.  More or less every game so far has involved me watching the ship trundle slowly through the ocean for a few minutes, until it gets ripped apart by the first, or sometims the second (or, on a single memorable occasion, the third) enemy unit I run into.\n\nIn its current state, not at all recommended.

For some reason, some of Terarria's 0.05% drop rate items felt LESS like a grind that getting Echoes here, and that was because the core game was still fun to play. Eventually you'll end up with ships with an Aft weapon and Forward weapon but by the time you get there to enjoy variety, you can kill anything in the game with a Deck gun you purchased 20 minutes in the game and the starting ship. A final note on the gameplay, the game doesn't tell you this, but selling pretty much anything is a mistake. Minus stories which you can sell if they go over say 10 to the University, you should be keeping everything else you stumble upon, even to the risk of overflowing your cargo, since you'll need it for some quest at some time and getting that item back will be a HUGE hassle. Secrets/Skill points also apply for that since you can trade them in for unique items at a certain spot.\n\nEither way, all in all, if you can get Sunless Sea for anything under 10E, pick it up and spend a weekend with it, it's not a bad experience, just don't expect to be kept drawn in too much.\n\nPS: For a game that also has rogue-like passing-down/legacy mechanics, you really lost a ♥♥♥♥ tonne of things upon dying to the point of wondering why it's even really there, one of the most expensive things you can never get back is your ship. Setting yourself up for the next character takes more time and effort that just keeping your current character alive and properly fitted.\n\nPS2: Speaking of rogue-like, for a game with so much unique content and poor core gameplay, i don't know why anyone would play a legacy of multiple characters with this. You'd be doing pretty much the same things, with a slightly-randomised map, nailing down the first three hours to doing the same things anyway until you get your actual sea-legs and can afford trips and events which you have already mostly seen anyway and know in which order to do to be MAX EFFICIENT.","May 15","true","5.9"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

[Jul. 4th]\n\n===This is actually a NEUTRAL review (5/10)===\n\nHaving been spending few hours into this game, I can say Sunless Sea promises a lot of potential.\nThe concept is intriguing, who doesn't like the deep dark sea to discover. The sea somehow resembles the space, like all space adventure u can think of, the sea is vast, dangerous and lonely. You have a goal to fulfill, and it is up to u to decide how u wanna "win" this.\nSome mechanics are quite interesting. Having high Terror leads to nightmares and losing zailors and officers. Combat system is easy to learn and control and so on.\n\nBUT (always a but) the game still needs a lot of twitching and balancing.\n- UI is too scrambled and messy, I spent like an hour or so to get fully familiarized with the UI\n- Lack of Tutorials and guides, the journal is a mess like UI, sometimes you are not even sure wut to do.\n- If u've played Fallen London before, u would notice most icons and thumbnails in Sunless Sea are like the ones in Fallen London, which is bad cuz the definition for those pictures are too foggy to be presented in a PC game. Sunless Sea should not remind player this is actually a brower game or ported mobile game (But sadly, as for now, Sunless Sea is totally a browser game to me, like Fallen London\n- Button not working, namely Toggle [L]ight button, u can only press [L] for light toggle, the button on the screen does not work\n- Economic balance is bad... I'm not going deep on this topic.\n- Repetitive content, yeah i know it's still in EA, but still, basically wut u r doing is going from port to port, handing in reports and fighting sea creatures and pirates. Like I said the economic balance is bad, so u can hardly earn anything from trading.\n\nSo for now, my advice is: Wait for it to go ready and see wut happens then, I cannot recommend this to most gamers in its present standings.","July 3, 2014","false","7.7"," 24 of 38 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","24","38","0","1"

It's long, tedious, and drawn out, maddeningly so. In fact, I'll say it now, be prepared to spend hours doing little more than watching your ship crawl, painfully so, across the map to get from point a to b, with no distractions in between. I actually pulled out my gamboy and started playing paperboy while sailing around. That being said tho, I do consider it a decent game, just be prepared to waste a good 20-40 hours of your life learning how to play it properly.\n\nThe object of the game is basicly to live out a life and achieve the personal objectives of your character then die, and repeat. Every time you do so maps are randomized leaving to explore and find the same old ♥♥♥♥ all over again, and possibly, most likely, die in the process. Either due a lack of resources while out at sea, or random occurances which affect your recources and cripple you, and while there is combat, it's nearly impossible to kill anything without upgrading your ship drastically. The big issue with it is, sadly, a lack of resources.\n\nDid I mention this is a resource managment game? So much so that earning money is an extremely difficult and tedious process. Any money which is earned is then spent on fuel and supplies. There are upgrades, better ships, weapons, and other crap of which I shall label "gear", but generally speaking these things are so expensive, and so much of your money is, spent isn't the word I want to use here, exhausted, a very accurate word in this case, on supplies, that it's nearly impossible to scrounge up enough for a better ship. In fact, after doing some digging in this game's steam forums I've found out that the developers have taken it upon themselves to nerf any and all forms of semi-lucrative actions to the ground. That being said, the game does seem to be designed to be beaten in the starter ship, with starter gear. So, there's that I suppose.\n\nI will say the game has a decent story, what little I've seen of it, and an interesting, immersive, and rather charming world. That being said tho, it's eaten over 30 hours of my life, and I've gotten no where with it. So, it was fun while it lasted but, I can tell you that charm can only go so far, and I rather regret the time, energy, and money I put into this game.","June 3, 2015","false","39.2"," 25 of 40 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","25","40","0","0"

The atmosphere is great, the stories superb, the music is wonderful. As most have pointed when you die you get to choose some form of legacy to leave behind, which is nice and helps with quests sometimes like say.. die right before finishin? Leave your next captain a map so you know where and where not to zail next game.\n\nThough I must admit, this game does go without hope sometimes. I once ran out of fuel and decided to wait to see if a friendly ship would pass by and give me a bit of fuel. Nope. Crew started starving, then a kraken of sorts came by. Suprisingly the crew ate me before the kraken could destroy us.\n\nmy only complaint thus far?

I didn't play Fallen London, which a lot of the content in this game is drawn from I hear, jumping straight into Failbetter's surreal universe with Sunless Sea.\n\nSurreal being the operative word. A mix of a subterranean steampunk tech and 19th century sailing culture with a little utter madness thrown in.\n\nThe artwork is beautiful and the writing exceptional. Failbetter have clearly worked very hard at this, as evidenced by the number of iterations the game went through before it was released, and I can't imagine them stopping here simply because they've hit a 'final' release. Each version has built on what they had before to the point that a game with serious clout has been the outcome.\n\nYou'll sail around, constantly terrified that your crew will do something stupid, or simply go nuts. You'll fight bizarre underground monsters and other ships. You'll meet people who could've come straight out of a Gaiman or Lovecraft story, and they'll... Do stuff... That might even help you out. You'll see the kind of overabundance of the letter Z you've only dreamed of before this. You'll also probably rage-quit a couple of times, but I wouldn't let that get in the way ;)\n\nIf you like slightly crazy, punishingly difficult games with (ostensible) permadeath and all the other lovely mores of modern gaming, you can't go far wrong with this one. The culmination of what's been created here stands above the rest, anyway, in my opinion.\n\nBuy it; it's a lot of fun.

I want to feel drawn in to a game; I want to feel like I'm living a story, with countless possiblities spread out before me. I want to act and react to the game with my gut, pulled in to its world by the writing and music and life of it. This holds for any type of game for me, be it RPG or FPS or RTS. I don't care what it is, I just want to truly feel a part of it, and to actually care about what's going on with my characters/game world/what-have-you.\n\nSunless Sea delivers. I knew I wanted it from the first five minutes of watching an LP of the game, and I have not been let down. This isn't a game for an impatent player. If you jump from thing to thing without reading the story or listening to the ambient sounds -- without letting yourself really soak up the game -- you're bound to lose interest fairly quick, to be fair. However, if you like to be immersed and take your time, and really allow yourself to feel... Well, I can't recommend this game enough. It's... Creepy? Unusual? Atmospheric? Thought-provoking?

You might anticipate a fight but no, all that happens is a crewman steps forward, completly unafraid of it for some reason and it gently grabs him and pulls him beneath the waves without so much as a sound or an ounce of struggle from the crewman.\n\nAnd its never mention again. In the world of the sunless sea, this sort of stuff just... happens. And it will creep you the hell out. This game really really gets the concept of sublety and atmosphere.\n\nWhat it doesnt quite get is the actual game part. The learning curve is so steep its a cliff, home to many murderous bats who do significant damage that cant be repaired cost effectively and will end your journey often and in unsatisfying ways that feel cheap and hard to combat.\n\nThe game is somewhat unintuitive and suffers from poor progression of skills and upgrades. Heck for that matter you'll often find that the rewards from completing a mission dont even go halfway to covering the costs you acrued in repairs, fuel and supplies.\n\nIf this were a novel I imagine it would be one of my favourites.

I bought this game thinking it would be a nice twist on trade and exploration games. I understand the developers have focused on exploration over trading and that is fine. However the game feels like a grind, and it shouldn't. This is a paid game, not the free Fallen London (which I have also played). I know the game is still in development, but if the game is half as grindy as it is now it will still be a major problem. While I love the lore and think this game has a lot of potential, I must give it a thumbs down unless they fix the trading and grinding. Making it so difficult that players must stick to certain trade routes just to make a little profit hinders the exploration aspect. When I feel this game will not be another grind  like Fallen London (I understand why FL is a grind) I will give it a thumbs up. Until then, I must give it a thumbs down.

Interesting in concept but flawed in execution.\n\nThe original combat mechanics were slow turn-based and kinda dull. Since the update combat is real time against cheating enemy AI (so best avoided although that isn't possible)  The severe resource shortage will have you grinding for hours or failing, probably both. Fortunately the devs continue to update and support the game, unfortunately there is a long way to go before Sunless Sea feels fun to play.","November 6, 2014","false","2.7"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","17","26","0","0"

The cost for resources are too high, compared to rewards, that you either luck out on map RNG and have the few high reward islands near the capital, at which you can get enough money to have some fun...or the map is such that the capital is in the middle of nowhere causing you to slowly bleed resources until you will not have enough to leave port.\n\nThe devs say up front that your character is supposed to die over and over, but still, it seems too strict. While interesting, I would not recommend this for someone wanting to have fun.","December 8, 2015","false","13.6"," 17 of 26 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","17","26","0","3"

However several bad designs deform the shiny points of this interactive novel: Unbalanced danger-reward proportion, only one battle approach and limited enemy varieties leave combat mechanic abysmally. Subsequent playthroughs aren’t compelling due to inconsequential decision results of scripted text-based interactions. HUD fails to convey essential data such as targets, rewards and methodologies because of utilizing tiny textual style which naturally has blurry impact, thus players fumble to organize in un-instinctual game. Besides sanity system isn’t indicated visually clear or clarified in User Interface. Unsustainable economic model is comprised of hunger, sanity and fuel which exhaust most resources needed to advance progression. Even though exploration is the only approach to experience storyline and achieve winning conditions of the game, players are wrongly encouraged by game economic to repeat same Fed Ex Quest using a glacial pace sprite across uneventful ocean and grinding a monotonous and time consuming trade which profits a mere pittance in order to continue exploration. Consequently the splendid writing and astonishing world setting are simply covered underneath a slow-pace grinding system because potential pitfalls is excessively overwhelming of the objective. What’s more, permanent death becomes a drag of progression system due to the fact that Sunless Sea doesn't have enough new content or gameplay to maintain a long chain of different playthroughs with a glacial slow game pace.","February 16","false","1.1"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","0"

The notion of a wanderer, nomad or a vagabond relies on the notion of cheap travelling expenses. If you burn stashes of bank notes in your steam engine, it feels like an artificially imposed, unfun "difficulty".\n\nI always judge the games on how enjoyable is the core activity you spend most time doing. That's why I did not finish might and magic games, because I find the combat boring and repetitive. On the other hand, I enjoyed games like Dark Souls, GTA or Red Dead Redemption, because the driving/riding/combat is good enough on its own.\n\nHere the game fails badly - chugging slowly over the empty see only to read another short torso of text just does not feel enjoyable enough.

In a world where nightmares exist, and devils roam freely. Where the dead do not lie down, and icebergs are alive.\n\nSunless Sea is a brilliant game based on Fallen London's Universe of the Neath. The Neath is a dark, dreary place, where many things are not what they seem. And far too many are exactly what they seem. You play the role of a captain zailing the zea. To where? Well, that's up to you, good sir. The Neath is out for your exploration, and theres little to stop you...\n\nWell except for the living icebergs... Or the zea monsters.... Or that angry swarm of bats flying right towards you...\n\nThis game is about telling a story, and exploring a strange world that is very similar to our own. It has much to offer, from trading souls (don't ask where they come from) to dealing with the locals. Strange events occur, and nightmares are quite frightening. For the Neath is a dark place. A real dark place. Light is your friend. A precious friend.\n\nSadly, no game is without fault. But this one is mearly a minor one. For the developers are slowly adding more into the game, which means that not all things are stable. Not all the routes are open yet, and theres much that you'll want to see.\n\nSo go out there into that ztrange ztrange zea.

It's unforgiving on your time.  It takes AGES to sail from place to place, and by the time you get to the next destination in whatever sub-plot you are pursuing you find that you need some other piece of ridiculous treasure or gear that you have never heard of that will take another half-hour of your time on top of the mandatory sail back to london that takes for ♥♥♥♥ing ever.\n\nBut wait, while you sail you can fight sea monsters and ♥♥♥♥ right?  Sure, if you like an incredibly boring combat system with absolutely no variation.  The gear and gadgets that are meant to spice it up are ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS.  I would test them out only to find that trying to get them to work was more dangerous than just slowly sailing backwards kiting whatever monster crab/shark/eel (and thats like 90% of the enemies right there) was trying to headbutt my ship.\n\nAnd the writing for the game (an attribute that is meant to carry a great deal of the game) just goes strait up its own ♥♥♥ with how pretentious and mysterious it gets.  The entire narrative can be summed up in the following, "This world is so goddam mysterious that not even we know what the ♥♥♥♥ is going on nor are we going to make the slightest effort to elaborate because we are too ♥♥♥♥ing busy jacking off to our own over the top needlessly overcomplicated writing".  There is just way too much ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t going on at one time in the story for you to ever feel properly invested or grounded in any way. "Yeah dude bats like showed up and kidnapped london (or something whatever man), theres like devils and ♥♥♥♥, apparently people don't die down here they just decay and wrap themselves in bandages (except when they do die), and the only explanation for any of this ♥♥♥♥ is that the main character you are playing is stark raving mad because around every corner is another contradiction".\n\nI can't give you the countless examples of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t I've encountered, but i can tell you that the interesting if not pompous narrative combined with the rogue-lite gameplay and progression system DID NOT COME CLOSE to overpowering what an incredible waste of time this was.

With the occasional hinderance.\n\nSummary negatives: Bugs, a lack of a smooth in-game report feature and imbalances in game can wear and tear on some people. But the game developers seem to be hunting these down with fervor!\n\nAlso, for any new player who feels they're being broken down and dismayed - I suggest a look at the guide written here on steam, even though it contains a few spoilers, the suggestions are solid and enlightening - Or at least they felt that way to me!\n\n\n\nFor a bit more lengthy read, continue below:\n\nThe game offers the most for the people willing to submerge their minds fully into the zee, fueling the little strips of flavor text and embarking on great journeys - But I'm admittedly amongst the kind who simply enjoy exploration and the 'old school' touch. This game has a heap of text for a tutorial, it doesn't explain all of it and it does not point out that you're going to be in a mighty big heap of trouble if you dare challenge everything you encounter. It makes for an interesting patient-play where you want to find ways to dodge the enemies lurking in the zee, finding new places or try and guesstimate on gut feeling when you might be able to break them. Hint - It takes a long time, thus the note for patience.\n\nThe atmosphere is as rich as the trailer promises and I have in, just under 20 hours, explored about 1/3rd to 1/2 of the current avaliable content, not counting the more expensive ships. The 20 Euro cost is, in my opinion, given a solid base - The game is undergoing active development, the developers have experience that makes me belive in that they have good insight into their costs and what is required to make this game happen, in full, so to speak.\n\nAn example of the ongoing bugs:  I've just spent 4-7 hours doing a somewhat risky, but repeatable trade for decent profit, earning a grand total of 7200 before trading to the big cargo ship with boyishly gleaming eyes. And that is when I find out that the limit for 'Max 10 crew' does not update, even with bigger ships. This can be bypassed by going out, hunting pirates, sending crew back with them and then recruiting a new crew up to the 10 max. Rinse and repeat until you got a full compliment waiting in Fallen London, so fret not!\n\nFrom what I've seen of the developers behind this, they're working hard to implement a LOT more content, have a good insight into what expenses they'll need to cover and make solid, steady progress where they update on a monthly basis.\n\n\nPro's:\n*Engaged developer crew  - They've got my vote of confidence in making this game happen.\n\n*Great atmosphere - I played long into the night and the shadows glimpsed back at me afterwards.\n\n*Entertaining events and humor - A mix of optimism and dire straits without getting silly.\n\n*As rewarding as it is grisly and tough - Nothing like winning after being beat down and bruised!\n\n*No gamebreaking bugs - Everything I have encountered can be circumvented easily.\n\n*Old school steep learning curve - Not for everyone, but I and other old gamers love this feeling!\n\n*Intuitive UI - It is not hard to figure out game elements simply by going ahead and trying.\n\nCon's:\n*Very grisly and tough - Not everyone likes being beaten into the ground trying to learn.\n\n*Imbalances - Inconsistences fighting some monsters can be frustrating.\n\n*Place holders can be seen early - If you sail 'wrong' you might feel the world ends swiftly.\n\n*Unintuitive tutorial - Old school textblock with little insight into parametres and game UI overview.\n\n*Moneymaking - One of the biggest complaints people have, so I'm adding this.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Moleculor/recommended/304650/","Moleculor","Moleculor","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Moleculor/","540 products in account","The world of Sunless Sea is an intriguing one. It's a slightly whimsical twist on an ocean-themed Lovecraftian-esque horror.\n\nThe problem with this is that absent incredible graphics, it takes very high quality writing (and a lot of it) to pull off a world such as this.\n\nThe writing that is present in Sunless Sea? Is good. Not stellar, but pretty good. They manage to squeeze a lot of subtle themes and a 'feeling' of the place in to a few short sentences.\n\nSo what's my objection? Why do I say I don't recommend buying the game?\n\nEven though the writing is the game's 'strong' point, the point it sells itself on, the writing is merely good.\nWhat is written is good, but there isn't enough of it and it doesn't always work perfectly. As an example (mild spoiler for an early game location), there's a mansion/house on an island with three sisters inside. If you do a thing or two in the wrong order upon discovering this house, the game mentions that you are aquainted with the sisters, but 'things have changed'... despite not having known what things were previously, giving no context for what has 'changed'. Even if you do things in the 'correct' order, nothing actually changes. The writing associated with the sisters, the mansion, their stories? It's always identical to how it was when you first met them.\n\nThen, suddenly one day, everything changes (long, long after the game suggested things were changed). Without warning. So 'things have changed' for eight identical interactions, and then suddenly once everything seems routine, things are different. It turns out that your character (or the game interface?) psychically intuits 'changes' in the world without those changes being evident in the writing presented.\n\nSimilarly there's another 'quest chain' that seems merely capitalist in nature. 'Take this stuff over here and we'll pay you'. Every time you do it, it's exactly and perfectly identical, meaning that if you're here for the story or writing, it doesn't seem like there's any story or writing to be had at that location. The game interface, however, suggests the quest has further stages to it, without that implication being present in the writing.\n\nIf the location in question is positioned out of the way (the map is semi-random), you then have no reason to visit the location frequently, other than to grind out money MMO-style. Then, suddenly one day without explanation, the quest changes. No reason for it changing, no explanation for why the government (the government is involved) has ceased doing things the way they always have, just... things are suddenly different. When you follow that particular quest to its end? The end is abrupt, without explanation, and seemingly pointless ("here's some money, go away").\n\nIf things are changing, if events are progressing, you'd expect the writing to reflect that. The writing does not, leaving a lingering feeling of narrative whiplash behind as the abrupt and inexplicable changes in the world happen seemingly at the roll of random dice, while the game's design expects you to realize that progression is occuring within this narrative arc based on UI tooltips rather than engaging and varied writing.\n\nThe pacing is atrocious.\nCombat-related upgrades, short of a few early-game purchases, are entirely out of reach for any but the most experienced players, and most players can not obtain the experience necessary to become rich enough to purchase those items without winning combat reliably. A near-Catch-22. (The answer to this is avoid combat entirely, or exploit the AI. More on that later.)\n\nThe writing is sparsely available. Almost all of it is relegated to far-flung ports of call, so experiencing more story or more writing (the 'strong' point of the game, and likely the reason you bought it) requires mind-numbingly boring journeys across a nearly-empty 'zee'. Vast amounts of the game involve sitting motionless at your computer, staring at your ship as it moves in a straight line from one port to the next. You occasionally might want to fiddle with the lights or might need to steer to avoid a rock or monster, but generally you'll spend easily more than half of your game staring at a boat, rather than reading.\n\nThis sparcity of writing wouldn't be a problem if each port-visit brought new content, a new thing to read, something worth the time you spent 'zailing', but more often than not you'll only see the same content the last time you visited. That several-minute voyage you just made? Well, it ended in a visit to a place you've already seen, with writing you've already seen. Congrats! It's like you're re-reading the same chapter of a book over and over again. Fun, right?\n\nThe combat is abyssmal.\nAs mentioned previously, combat upgrades are not readily available even to a character that has played for a significant time. There are a very small number of upgrades you can purchase without replacing your boat, and replacing your boat itself is prohibitively expensive. At the time of this review, I've played two captains (the first lived four hours of in-game time, the second 15-16). I never even came remotely close to being able to afford a new ship hull, limiting both my upgrade options (hulls have an unlisted, unexplained maximum speed regardless of engine power, and the starter ship can only outfit one category of weapons out of three categories).\n\nThis wouldn't be a problem if combat was something you had to actively seek out, but frequently you have to actively avoid combat encounters, and you'll end up needing to do that (or exploit the very bad AI) in 80% of the areas you'll be visiting.\n\nYes, you read that right. I ended up exploring very nearly all of the available map with my second captain, and short of areas very close to Fallen London, I'd always have to avoid combat. Nearly everything outclassed me. As an example, the starter ship has 75HP. Enemies you may come across while still exploring and learning the map could have 600 or even 1000HP.\n\nIn my most recent case, my fairly successful second captain, which had managed to survive and explore for 15+ hours, had his ship sunk in a combat encounter that lasted less than five seconds. From my perspective? It was a combat encounter that only occurred because this hulking behemoth (that I couldn't really see) of an enemy just happened to brush against the top edge of my visible screen. Before I even realized I was being shot at, I was under half-health. A second or two later, I was dead, and 15+ hours of exploration and work was gone.\n\nThe game was asking me to explore and 'zail' in to areas where doing something that isn't even obviously a 'mistake' could end up with you dead before you even realize you're in danger.\n\nWorse yet, many of the quests in the game require you to engage in combat (without explaining that combat is where to get the required items). You'd think that a game that prides itself on its writing would have something in writing explaining that 'fishing' in the game is done with your guns. If you want to read the narrative, the whole point of buying the game? You have to engage in near-suicidal acts (combat in the starter ship)that are made only survivable by exploiting the very weak AI. Survival in combat is a matter of rushing the enemy and kissing your boat to it. The AI gets confused, spazzes out, and tries to move away from you. So long as you hug the enemy, it can't fight back. This is true for all animals, and also true for the other ships in the game so long as you hug those ships' backsides.\n\nThe 'proper' way to play is counter-intuitive.\nMy most 'successful' outings were the ones where I risked running out of fuel before reaching a place where fuel was affordable or even sold. I'd expand more, but apparently there's a character limit. I'll work on paring down this review to squeeze more in later.","February 16, 2015","false","19.6"," 68 of 124 people (55%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","55","68","124","2","3"

It looks fairly limited?  Well on the back of some really high octane/adrenaline fuelled games I've been playing of late - I have to say what a breath of fresh air this game is. Its at the polar opposite end of the spectrum, this game is one of the most relaxing and chilled out experiences I have experienced in 20 years of gaming.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkIjlx9GUGg\n\nThe game sees you navigating a small cargo ship through the murky waters of the zee (formerly the sea before it sunk beneath the world itself) and it gently works its way into your mind with its beautifully written stories, its wonderfully designed art work and its incredibly unique sense of atmosphere and mystery.\n\nIts based around resource management with some pretty basic combat at its core, and while the combat is quite linear I honestly don't feel it detracts too much from the game. You have a crew of zailors and officers who are subjected to fear, terror, hunger and all sorts of nastiness. Terror especially can play havoc with your crew, the longer you spend out at zee the higher it goes and this increases at a variety of rates depending on how perilous the surroundings seem to be. However the absolute backbone of this game comes within its writing, each port will have stories, news, pieces of information and points of interest - some of which is just for entertainment purposes, but others actually drive the game / quest forward for you. There are endless opportunities to be had in this game, the majority of the map is randomly generated and every single play through is different.\n\nCheck out the video if you want a flavour of what I'm talking about.","February 22, 2015","true","31.7"," 10 of 14 people (71%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","71","10","14","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/dateryu/recommended/304650/","dateryu","dateryu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/dateryu/","264 products in account","TL;DR This game has some great ideas, but the implementation is very flawed. Do yourself a favor and play in merciful mode unless you want to die because of bad game and UI design, losing days of progress. This is made even worse by this being a heavily text based game with a rigid quest system, so dying means just having to read the same text again and redo everything you already did.\n\nHere's a detailed example of what I mean by bad design. You die if you get three wounds. That's pretty fast considering how easy it can be to get wounded and how other things that can kill you will only do so at much higher levels. But the main UI doesn't show you your "wounds" number. Instead you are expected to go to the management menu, called the "gazetter", then go to the "journal" tab, then find the "menaces" section so you can find out how wounded you are. Thats bad enough in that you'll neglect to do all that and do something that kills you. But there are times when you have the option of doing something that can wound you, and the game doesn't let you go to the "journal" tab. So expect to die a few times because of that.\n\nAlso there was the time I went to the surface to get a shipment of supplies for cheap prices, and the game made me buy each unit of supplies individualy. This may not sound like much but I bought 70 units and each supply bought required scrolling to the "buy" storylet, clicking the button, then clicking ok, then scrolling again etc.\n\nStuff like this is pretty easy to fix and would improve the game, but as I said the main concept is very flawed.","February 10","false","13.4"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

In fact, that's the huge draw here.\nThe lore is great. Simply fantastic.\n\nAt first it seems a bit silly. But then you read, and visit other places, talk to people... and it all kinda adds up to an interesting and perhaps dark (but humorous) world that draws you in making you want to find out more. I've spent most of my time reading in ports/towns seeing what each is about through my actions like making a port report which upon handing in gets you (usually) a fuel and some echos (money), or engaging in some of whatever the town is known for. I feel bad I can't adequately describe the tone of the game, so I'll have to say I enjoy the writing. It's very well written, it's orignal, and uses words I really must look up.\n\nThe rest of my time is spent sailing from one place to another, exploring to find new places, and usually trying to avoid battles. Repairing your ship is expensive, so you'll usually want to avoid taking on most other ships or monsters you come across. Battles are definitely not the focus of this game and the progession, or lack thereof, of your ship and its parts (engines, weapons, different ships) is the weakest part of the game.\n\nThere are other ships to buy, but they all seem worse than your starting ship and/or are vastly too expensive to buy. Weapons have 3 places you can equip them, Deck, Forward, and Aft, but the starting ship may only equip a Deck weapon of which there are only a few and they aren't really that big of an upgrade for their high price. Engines as well are expensive, and some do have a big upgrade to speed, but it again seems disproportionate to the price.\n\nMost of my echos (money) go toward "supplies" (a specific item used as food mainly, but you may also use them to repair your ship a handfull of points out of town if you have above 50% hull left) and "fuel" to keep going. Perhaps it's just that I don't know how to abuse the game yet. Buying the "Elegant Townhouse" for 1,000 echos allows you to make a will for 200 echos passing along your house and later, I'm told, some other usefull items I haven't gained.\n\nUpon retiring (you can do this after buying the house if you want) or dying I've been choosing the carry-over option of passing my captains chart to the next one so I know where everything is still and so the map doesn't semi-randomize. Other options include passing an officer, a weapon, half your echos, and another one I forget at the moment. You always choose between one of those five things to pass along to the next captain even if you don't have the house or will. (I'm pretty sure this is true since one of my captains didn't have a will yet and died but I still got to choose)\n\nI also have some gripes with the journal being difficult to find what you're supposed to do for a quest if it even has anything in there about what you're supposed to do. I'm either going to have to grab a pencil and paper and write stuff down or just deal with being confused and not finishing quests and missing opportunities to gather what I need when I'm someplace that has it.\n\nI've written more about the negatives than the positive, and I have a few other small gripes not written, but I definitely do recommend this game based on its great strength in story and the feeling of apprehension when you leave a port and start travelling, wondering what you'll discover next and if you'll have enough fuel and supplies to make it back to Fallen London. If you enjoy reading and becoming drawn into a world, this game will have you for hours through different captains wanting to see the various choices/events to do further.\n\nI bought this for just under $13 (a -33% off sale) and I feel that's exactly the right price for me.","November 1, 2015","true","22.3"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

At present the game is INCREDIBLY grindy, unforgiving, and a little bit punishing which is always a nuisance.\nNow I'd say this is a roguelike or lite or whatever you want to call it but it really can't be called that because the only thing that's randomized really are the events and the enemies and the latter is in ever rpg ever so yeah, not to mention you can send something to your next character if your current one dies. The Map is static at the moment and the risk reward balance is HEAVILY skewed so that anything risky is barely rewarding and the combat is kind of slow and gets a bit dull when you have to inevitably grind. Making Echo (money) in this game is really tough, I mean Really tough, you can either go the safe but excruitatingly slow economic cargo running route but the pay off is slow and it probably takes about an hour if nothing goes wrong to make enough for a low level upgrade. If you want to fight pirates or monsters... they pay off is worse and much more risky. Something else that actually really bothered me is the lack of explanation in the explanation of how things work and what events will do, the wording is tricky and if you haven't seen an event before you may think you're getting something out of it when its taking something from you instead, you quickly get used to it though.\n\nHaving said all this I did enjoy some of my time playing like I said before but it just wasn't enough of the time I played or enough satisfaction for me to really recommend the game at the current price and state (maybe 50% off or when they address some issues). Those things aside it runs smooth and I didn't encounter a single bug, although plenty of content was missing to be patched in later. 6/10","July 5, 2014","false","5.8"," 13 of 20 people (65%) found this review helpful","65","13","20","0","0"

It's nerve-wracking to conduct business on a variety of fronts, hope for a good roll of the die, and still barely make a profit to adventure forward.  The grind is rough, but if balanced a little bit more, it'll feel about right.\n\n* There have been some noticable typos; such as a job requires 3 crew-men and only 2 are needed.  I'm sure these will pop up every now and then.\n* I haven't bought a new ship yet, but I find it frustrating that other ships and creatures can turn on a dime very quickly, whereas I still have to make a round around an island before making a 180 (I know there is a reverse, that's not the point).\n* I think a nice addition would be a flare gun to send a signal for a tugboat that brings you back to port in case you run out of fuel just feet before docking.  I could have got an oar out and paddled instead of needing to restart.\n* The combat system flows well, but when two enemies are in range, I can't target the other.","November 1, 2014","true","20.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

There are regular updates and a good roadmap, so i expect this review will be out-of-date in a few months.\n\nIt tries hard to feel like FTL, with back-and-forth ship combat and detailed storytelling. It has a good variety of things to do in the little docks and places you'll find, and certainly looks and feels the way the authors intended - whimsical and yet dark. There are a good amount of things to manage, from food to fuel to fragments of knowledge (which you can trade for money). It feels like it's going in  the right direction.\n\nUnfortunately, it's just not there yet. Your ship is unbearably slow (unless you want to risk a fire by going a normal speed), the enemies monotonous and tiresome (how many rewardless giant crabs and bat swarms am i going to have to fight?), and there doesn't feel like there's a point to combat. Unless you take on a pirate ship, you gain nothing from it. A game should make efforts to provide you with incentives for your actions, not just insert filler to keep you occupied while you wonder why you're playing.\n\nWorse, the map is static, and everything is spread far apart. Go too far to the north? Welcome to the lifebergs which oneshot you with zero illumination. Braving the south? Cool, but watch out for buoys which instantly destroy your ship (and bug out your sound) if you touch them.\n\nNormally I'm cool with dying, but with this game, it just feels like a chore. There's nothing random about the game,  so you wind up just replaying everything you already did, then trying to find something new to do. This style of gameplay only works if you're allowed to game the save/load features, but with permadeath it's pointless. There's a "merciful mode" which allows you to save/load at will, but it still autosaves when you die - meaning that it's still permadeath.\n\nAgain, I like what it's going for; keep an eye on this one. But don't buy it until they address the monotony and pointlessness.","July 4, 2014","false","1.1"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

The glitches.\n\nThere are so many interface glitches, basic ones, that I'm surprised haven't been fixed.\n\nMore than 4 times over 4 hours, I've had tooltips and menus stuck on-screen. I just chose to defer choosing my origin until later, only to have the menu glitch out when picking my portrait. I had to manually save (which removes/stops the 'Unmerciful' run where you rely on autosave), just so I could exit and reload to clear the glitch.\n\nNothing completely gamebreaking yet, but I'm honestly surprised it hasn't been bugfixed still.\n\nThere are also some clunky interface/UI choices. For example, when you die you can pick a legacy. One legacy is pre-checked for you. I tried picking the others but they were greyed out and wouldn't be checked. So I thought I just had to unlock those later.\n\nTurns out no, you have to first click to uncheck the pre-checked legacy, then click another. Nothing on the interface indicates this. In fact, it would have been better to not pre-check anything for the player at all in that case, and let us choose one straight away.\n\nAlso despite there being a tutorial book for players, there's no way to simply get a page of definitions from the System Menu, and I have no idea why. For example, the impact of Crew on Supplies, if any? There's no explanation either way.\n\nStuff like is annoying and clunky, but you can get pass it. It's obvious the most effort and talent was spent on the story and world-building, and it is excellent.\n\nHowever, I hope that since they have a DLC coming up, that the developers would put more effort into basic bugfixing and testing. A screw-up from the interface at no fault to the player can screw with their game, especially if they want to do an Unmerciful run, but have no choice but to manually save and destroys that run.","February 28","true","13.1"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","1"

It weaves a haunting Lovecraftian tale as you discover and collect mysteries, secrets and terrors. Punctuated by both eerie beautiful music and a stylized post-apocalyptic design, this game already delivers on multiple levels and oozes with both raw potential as well as already realized excellence.\n\nWhile there is the usual underlying drive to garner resources and improve your equipment, crew and ship, the focus is on the stories you find. These tales are both worth money to various parties back in Fallen London as well as all to the essence of the game experience itself as they are exceptionally well-written and paint the horrific, disturbing and intriguing picture of the world. As you sail the dark underground sea you amass a Terror rating which drives the stories available in the ports that you discover as well as the strange challenges you face at sea as your Terror grows. You will perish often (especially early on) as you find the rhythm of exploration, purchasing of fuel/supplies and returning to Fallen London to barter your tales and experience for money. Even dying does not feel like a true loss as you get to pass something on to your successor (your sea charts, an officer, or a skill).\n\nFew games evoke ambience and emotion as well as Sunless Sea.

You can play either on Invictus Mode (only Autosaves) or on Mercy Mode (Saves at port), but the game’s Legacy System allows you to restart your game with something from your old captain so that death is never the end. The game is a sound rpg, and it has a fresh take on morality – allowing you to decide how ruthless you are in pursuit of your objectives. The locals are distinct and at times bizarre, but every island has its own charm. There is no overarching story, instead you deal with challenges and decide the fate of underground nations even as you try and make ends meet. I would elaborate but it’s better if you have a chance to find out for yourself.\n\nThe game is less than $20, and for that you get a thought-provoking game with excellent stories, good gameplay and a decent replay value.\n\nI put it at 4.5/5 – a good game for students to play between study sessions.\n","February 5, 2015","true","120.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","9","13","0","0"

You sail your ship between ports and explore dialogue trees at each port. There is some random variation in the map and story each game but not a lot, making this more like a scripted RPG than a roguelike. Death is permanent but you have the option of retaining a single item and attribute between replays.\n\nThe ship moves slowly making travel times tedius. I'd suggest installing CheatEngine or some other tool that will let you play the game in fast-forward when travelling between ports since the travel time isn't particularly interesting. This will remedy the most-often-cited complaint about the game.\n\nThe other common complaint is the user interface which is occasionally quite poor.

The gameplay consists of two distinct phases - sailing and being at port. When sailing (apart from random events) the game is a top-down exploration game. You move from port to port expending fuel and supplies, exploring and facing sea monsters. In port the game is entirely text based - with decisions being made through multiple dialogue choices. This may seem a strange design decision, but the writing is very well done and the text paints a vibrant setting of the world that might otherwise be lost.\n\nPros\n- Brilliant writing (evokes everything from terror to humor expertly)\n- Unique and well-developed world\n- Sense of constant dread in the form of resource attrition and threats of the zee\n- Replayability from multiple options and outcomes of quests\n- A stat system with both a % chance to complete challenges, and ship combat performance based on your stats\n- Real consequences to actions - your decisions (or lack thereof) may come back to please/haunt you later\n- A friendly development team that delivers on promises and releases content regularly\n\nCons\n- Unlike most sailing games, standard trading of goods from city to city is not very profitable (at this point in development)\n- Fairly linear progression of ship upgrades - Engine 1 is flat out better than engine 2 (once again, this may change later in development)\n- A very long grind to get the best ship (after 40 hours of play and 4 captains I have yet to make half the money I need for the best ship, let alone the best guns, engines, etc.)\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThis game is well worth 20 dollars and is in no way a risk to purchase in early access, as the developers are delivering on content consistently and in a very calculated manner. I have had a great deal of fun with this game and am not anywhere near done playing it. However, if you are still on the fence about purchasing the game I would strongly advise you to check out Fallen London. It is a browser-based game by the same developers, with the same writing style and challenge style that you will see in Sunless Sea. It is entirely free, and is a great way to see if you will like the way the port portion of Sunless Sea will play.\n\nGood luck, and happy zailing!\n","January 26, 2015","true","62.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Your enemies are everything around you, even your own mind. Terror builds while in the darkness, while in the light of towns and bouys (spelling?) your terror stops. Battlke sea creatures and pirates, ferry the dead, even deal in souls. All of this can be done on the Sunless Seas!\n\nPros:\nMusic - Well done and easily matches the tone of the game. Fell in love with it right away.\nContent - Thought not a high amount of ports things changes from time to time, so going back to a place youve been to may wield unexpected results.\nTwisted Atmosphere - If it was only pirates Id have passed it up. Deep ones and dark creatures make this story a very interesting one.\nDeath - When you die, its game over like in any rogue like game, there is perma death though this is turned off in the merciful mode allowing you to save. However you can pass one of your Map, officers or skills to the next generation. I always recommend the map as its very useful.\n\nCons:\nText Based Game - Not for everyone, I didnt mind it as enjoy reading and usually read lore and such in MMO's but it is not for everyone.\nMoney - Making money in this game is a slow paced process, though easy, it can be long.","November 1, 2014","true","32.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

I mean, who wouldn't want to buy a game where the premise behind it is 'London has been stolen by bats'?\n\nSince buying it though, I have come to appreciate what a brilliant game this actually is. London now rests on the edge of a vast, underground sea, the unterzee, and you are the Captain of a sailing vessel. What your ultimate goal is, be it gathering wealth, fame, or hunting for your father's lost bones, it is your place to sail the unterzee, exploring weird and exotic places, trading unusual and rare objects, or even carry coffee to the surface.\n\nThere are quite a few different factions, all of them clamouring for control over some aspect of the zee, whether it is the anarchists vs the admirality in London, or the Wildweald Court in the Empire of Hands, the brothers at the Chapel of Light, or the sisters at Abbey Point. All have their own agenda, and it is up to you if you assist them, hinder them, or stop them completely.\n\nAdd to all of this a dark, yet quirky sense of humour, solid gameplay that is easy to get the hang of, but difficult to master, and an eerie soundtrack, and you have a very fun game that will keep you guessing.","April 29, 2015","true","161.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It can be hard to start over with a new captain after putting so much effort into upgrading or new ships, and I can see it growing stale once you've gone through a lot of stories a number of times, but it's still fresh for me when I start over (and I've done it fairly often because I make the worst decisions. I should never be allowed to navigate a ship.

There is alot to like that will hopefully come to fruition in the future. Certainly the world is something any Jules Verne/Joseph Konrad fan will adore and I think the writing and storytelling is in the 99 percentile of any game I've played. The gameplay sadly, falls far below what is acceptable. The placeholder islands and enemies just put too much uncertainty in this for it to be fun and satisfying or either or.\n\nTo put it in perspective, I've played this game a ton hoping for it to get better because I took the wrong path a la Dark Souls, but it is always just the same grind so far, the three sisters, the tomb folks and then meander around the sea doing the same thing I did last time. Maybe take a little too much risk for much reward, and then in the end die in very boring sea battle or to madness. It's not the dying that bothers me. It's the very boring rebirth.\n\nI personally am not so sad I dropped almost $20 Canadian on this, but I am more altruitic than most.

Managing to be Lovecraftian and Steampunk inspired without falling into the pratfalls of either genre, Sea offers hours upon hours of gameplay to the point where it could be considered slog uphill for players who want faster progression. If you do however have the time to put into Sunless Sea you'll see how every pinched penny can offer you (and your character's legacy, as when you die you can continue as a related family member of your own creation)  upgrades to your ship, home and general life experiences in Fallen London that'll make your head spin.\n\nWhile not a game for everyone it does hold true to it's roots as a text-based adventure game.

Basicly one just steers a steamship around a bunch of islands on a 2D map, which sounds hugely boring. The occasional fights are either very easy, or very very hard, and the akwardness of the combat system doesn't help out when the shooting starts.\n\nHowever. The epic athmosphere, constant management of resources, sence of discovery, beautiful 2D art and the sheer Terror of never being quite sure one is going to make it back to port (or be able to afford to leave out again!) create gameplay that is hugely addictive.\n\nOfcourse, after the journey comes the destination, and here's where Sunless Sea really shines. The numerous islands and other locations all offer their own very well written text-based adventures. The adventures also often span several locations, forcing the players crew of mariners to those desperate journeys to find unknown destinations.

It brings solid exploration and trading mechanics familiar to the genre, as well as a pretty innovative combat system.\n\nWhat sets this game apart, though, is its story, atmosphere, and setting. By turns tantalizingly curious, deeply melancholy, bizarrely hilarious, and hauntingly lonely, it encompasses an entire underground world with its own history and life. You can pay homage to the gods of the sea, or spit in their eye and weather the consequences. You can settle disputes between warring factions of an aristocracy of gueinea pigs and a technocracy of rats. You can trade honey that transports you to dreams, discover what lurks on the far side of the mirror, and, of course, explore the reaches of an endless, sunless sea.\n\nThe writing is a cut above anything else I have encountered. Delivered in medium length 'storylets,' the text doesn't simply tell a story, it brings to life a warped reflection of Victorian exploration. Failbetter has managed to escape the trap of a wall of text that feels like a chore to read without the slightest hint of dumbing it down for the sake of expediency. The language is rich, deep, and expansive, and delivered in such a way that I'm always left wanting just another story in the next port. And the writing is so good that I am always tempted to make rash decision just to find out what horrible end Failbetter has devised for my captain.\n\nOh, and the music is awesome. It sets the mood perfectly. I'm not much of music guy, but I really like what they've done here.\n\nI cannot recommend this game enough. For anyone interested in exploring a new, twistedly vibrant world devised by some truly brilliant minds, pick this up, turn the lights down, and let yourself be carried away to the world of the Sunless Sea.","February 3, 2015","true","34.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

So many ways to lose, but as every Dwarf knows, losing is fun! Make no mistake, this game is hard and only repeated deaths will lead the way to greater success. It's harsh in so far as you have to make the mistakes to learn to avoid them, as in games like FTL, but it lacks the randomness of FTL to make it more palateable in subsequent attempts. I cautiously recommend this game because of its sly prose, spooky soundtrack and constant feeling of peril.","February 7, 2015","true","35.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

There was no point to the game. Nothing was finished and their was no point in travelling around the map, and your only options were to wander pointlessly until you died. So I walked away for a time. But I have recently gone back and played the finished product and I can honestly say that I fell in love with the game. Sure the story needs some polish and I would appreciate more options when it came to some of the locations, but the joy of the game is discovery. This is not a game for those who want to sick close to London and play it safe. As you travel farther and farther out you discover more lucritive oppertunites, and more interesting storylines( fun fact: you can sail to the edges of the map, witch turned out to be some of the best/worst decisions I ever made). Also: Don't be afraid to die. Death is only a temporary burden, and lets you start off with some of your old goods allowing you a slightly easier time, each time you restart. So don't worry about dying! Thats half the fun! Now get out and start sailing!\n\nOverall Opinion: 9/10\n\n-Needs more story.

Basicly one just steers a steamship around a bunch of islands on a 2D map, which sounds hugely boring. The occasional fights are either very easy, or very very hard, and the akwardness of the combat system doesn't help out when the shooting starts.\n\nHowever. The epic athmosphere, constant management of resources, sence of discovery, beautiful 2D art and the sheer Terror of never being quite sure one is going to make it back to port (or be able to afford to leave out again!) create gameplay that is hugely addictive.\n\nOfcourse, after the journey comes the destination, and here's where Sunless Sea really shines. The numerous islands and other locations all offer their own very well written text-based adventures. The adventures also often span several locations, forcing the players crew of mariners to those desperate journeys to find unknown destinations. (Or to eat each other!)\n\nThese two gameplay elements also combine in fresh and very interesting fantasy realm. Everything is sort of familiar, but also sort of mixed up, and nothing is really explained, leaving the player to puzzle out the lore of the world from random parts of text.\n\nThe steam gameplay counter claims I've played the game 20 hours, however it seems to me I've only managed to dabble in the mystery of Sunless Sea.

There was a war with Hell, which London lost and even though Londoners can go to the surface, they quickly get sick and nobody believes their stories. You play the captain of a steam ship in "The Zee".\n\nYou'll travel from port to port, trying to figure out the world, learning (and creating) stories both terrifying and unbelivable, battling giant golden crabs and demonic jellyfish, and so much more.\n\nThe gameplay is an excellent balance between resource management, keeping your sanity in check, traditional RPG 'checks' and naval combat.\nWhat's interesting about the gameplay is that you have many lose conditions, but you actually chose your win condition in the first few minutes of the game. This makes for a really fun dynamic with a lot of replayability and as you die, you can create more and more characters, eventually leading up to creating your own empire.\n\nDespite that it would be a perfect candidate for such, there are no 'rouge-like elements' in this game. No matter how many times you restart, the locations, quests, and loot will be the same. However, there is some randomization because you have to make a luck rolls, morality rolls, deception rolls, and more.

Even though I'm not a huge fan of these types of games I was pleasantly surprised. The stories and ambitions are fun and very well-written, the world of the Unterzee is beautifully crafted and the mechanics are easy to get into.\n\nThe game tells you that your first captain will, without a shadow of a doubt, die a pitiful death while at Zee, and it's right. Dying is the easiest thing in this game, even if you might not think so at first.\n\nAnd that is also a bit of the problem. While the stories intrigue and the characters enchant, you will inevitably have to go through them over and over again as captain after captain perishes when faced with a giant, tentacle-wielding iceberg laughing at you while you die. Because it takes ages to forge a legacy that will not reset the world completely, so after a few dozen deaths you get tired of visiting the three sisters and investigate the mists.\n\nSo while I can definitely recommend the game just for the story and atmosphere, I can't recommend to buy it at full price. I, personally, will wait until it's for sale, because with how much you have to repeat in this game story-wise, I can't spend almost 20 euros on it.","February 29","true","3.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

The world of the unterzee is as vast as it is confusing, you won't find all of it's secrets in one run in fact you'll be surprised to find out anything before your first captain is with the drownies at the bottom of the unterzee or in the belly of a zee beast but that's ok, this game is made to be enjoyed through several deaths.\n\nLets start out simple, the graphics are great for what this is. You're playing a 2D overhead exploring game, don't expect crytech graphics with frostbite action but expect beautiful terrifying buildings, lost islands that will invade your dreams or give you nightmares. Simple beauty is what i'm trying to say here, in my library of tripple A games with "real life graphics" this is one of the most beautiful because the images stick, when you see Irem or the Sea of Statues you don't easily forget them, they're all as different as can be yet all as haunting as the game implies.\n\nCombat is simple in Sunless Sea and expet to get into a fight often, you keep the enemy in sight of your guns and let them charge while staying out of their range and try to sink them and take their cargo or flesh depending on what you killed. There are skills that help with combat by making you hit harder or make you harder to see but that's not something i'll go over th game does it well enough on it's own. One important thing i need to stress is not to get cocky, from the very start you can run into enemies that will sink you faster than the titanic, learn what is where and when to run.\n\nNow my favorite part of Sunless Sea is the story, you need to find it. You are free to make whatever destiny you want, run between ports grabbing things for people or taking reports for the admiralty, sink ships or monsters and become the most powerful thing on the unterzee. There are several ways to win the game but none of them come easy, explore and make your own destiny in the unterzee or find the fastest way to retire you'll have fun either way and uncover things that might make you change course.\n\nOne thing i want to note about the game is that when your captain's run is over, win lose or draw, you can make a new one that can get special boosts depending on your last captain's choices. For example if you made a will your next character will start off with more choices over your items, if you made some heirlooms you'll get more money for your next captain, you can even find things in the game Fallen London for your next captain.\n\nSunless Sea is a great game, it's as long as you want to make it but terrifying all the way to the end, not in a horror game type of way though don't expect any jumpscares unless you happen to stumble upon the eye. At the time i'm writing this Sunless Sea has only been on full release for a short time and there are some things it needs like more stories to fill in spots and some more items to strive for but overall i give it a 9/10, great game just in need of polish.","February 27, 2015","true","28.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I both love it, and hate it. It's full of a rich story, which, when augmented with the free browser game "Fallen London" thats made by the same team, is even deeper, but the gameplay itself has some issues.\n\nFirstly, as others have aptly noted, the combat system is more or less just plain meh. Its frustratingly difficult in the beginning and later on is just rote method of blasting enemies. Secondly, while it can be fun to roam around and discover things for yourself, the game can become tedious with all the running around trying to figure out what particular item you need when. Thirdly, it drags. Not just when it comes to item acquisition, the game just gets boring. I put 30 hours into it, more or less loving it, and then finally, after I dabbled in the sunlight trade ( look on the guides for more info on THAT ), I just got BORED. The game had mostly lost its charm. It seemed as if it was either too hard to get money through regular methods, or too easy with the sunlight trade ( I do believe they've nerfed the sunlight trade in the latest update, but I haven't look into it- so don't go by that assessment entirely ).\n\nThe point is that its a slow game with a really rich story. You'll find yourself slogging across the Unterzee questioning your sanity for even playing the game anymore, but still enjoying the immersion. And also, when you DO discover that item you've been needing for hours, its absolutely wonderful!\n\nLastly, the game is a roguelike, you can turn on manual saving, but the default setting is rogue. You die and lose a ton of your gains.\n\nBottom line: I'm on the fence. If you can get it on sale then go ahead for sure, full price.... idk. I'm not saying not to, but I can't guarantee you'll like it.","February 27, 2015","true","46.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Otherwise, have fun grinding for several days before you have even the meager beginnings to start doing anything, and once you try to do anything, have fun barely having a 50% chance of success on anything you do.\n\nOnce edited, it's more enjoyable, because you can actually make decisions and expect them to succeed, and you skip all the interminable grinding. Or most of it, anyway.\n\nBecause even once you've got ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s of money, a solid ship, the stats needed to act on stuff and a cargo hold full of various items for quests... you still need pure random chance to actually trigger the events when you hit a port and poke around. Don't get the event? Have fun going sailing again for another, interminable while until you get the alert that says you can take another shot at it.\n\nAnd if you WEREN'T cheating your way to money, you'd have to do grinding in between each attempt in order to stay topped up on fuel, supplies and hull-repair.\n\nThe writing isn't fundamentally bad, but too often it tries to be prose rather than informative.\n\nThere's also the fighting is also pretty bad, since it basically consists entirely of just backpedalling while hurling salvos into enemies. There is literally no more tactics or skill to it and whether you win or not is completely down to stats and two or three consumables you can use to up your odds. Since the game has forwards and back-mounted weapons, rather than broadsides, there isn't even any space for basic naval stuff like crossing the T.","July 19, 2015","false","22.1"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

Seeing mysterious, leviathan shapes lurking below the waves ..\n\nThat's my only gripe.\n\nOtherwise, the game is innovative, unique, gripping and fun.  I give it 8.5 / 10 bronze jabberoos.\n\nIt has it's own identity, interesting art style and character, and every time you take your boat out on the zee, you feel a little bit tense, like you are genuinely exploring a dark Lovecraftian underworld.\n\nMy first sailor was a poet, drawn to the zee like a moth to the flame, I named him Gregorius P. Clutterbuck, and he was known for his tussled hair above his otherwise immaculate cravat.  (May he rest in peace).\n\nHis son, learning of his father's doomed venture into the underworld, felt the same magnetic pull.  His name was Willoughby G. Clutterbuck.  (May he rest in peace).\n\nHis teenage son, upon reaching his majority, learned of the doomed and insane fate of his predecessors by reading his father's diary, and interrogating the navigator, lone survivor of an ill-fated expedition into unknown waters.  He firmly refuted their insanity, and tried to live a conventional life .. but the pull of the zee was too strong.  At last surrendering to the wild compulsion, he has sold all his assets, including the family home, and outfitted a crude steam vessel, heading for the zee.  Unlike his father and his father's father, he does not wish to write a poetic epic about the zee, he simply wishes to find their bones and bring them back to London for a good, Christian burial.\n\nPerhaps he (Clarence W. Clutterbuck) will survive his quest, and live long enough to have something his fathers never did .... grey hair.  (Hair that turns white due to forbidden knowledge and laying eyes on gibbering horrors from the other side .. that doesn't count).","February 8, 2015","true","12.5"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","71","5","7","6","0"

The writing is professional and consistent; it establishes a distinct atmosphere, often with a limited yet well-phrased selection of prose.  I would recommend this game to anyone who has even a passing interest in the works of H.P. Lovecraft or more contemporary authors like China Mieville.\n\nHowever, the recommendation comes with some qualifications.  First, the pace of this game is slow and gradual.  Your initial steam ship putters along the Unterzee, and you can expect some voyages to last twenty minutes to an hour between leaving Fallen London and returning.  (Assuming you return at all.)  Ship and engine upgrades noticeably improve your speed, but not terribly so.\n\nSecond, this is not a trading game or privateering game comparable to Sid Meier's Pirates or other examples of that genre.  If you try to bulk buy and sell goods, you will make a marginal profit, if at all.  You can turn a profit looting zea monsters and pirates, but it's often a small and incidental gain.  If you try to grind your way to a better ship and upgrades with buy/sell trade routes, you will be frustrated.  Do not do this.\n\nI have found that it's fairly easy to make Echoes (the game's currency), particularly once you've gotten some experience under your belt.  To that end, here is a few tips to new Captains, to make their voyages in the Unterzee more enjoyable.\n\n1)  This game rewards dying, so take risks and explore.  Succeeding captains will be able to select from 'legacy' options, allowing you to inherit some of the progress of your poor, ill-fated initial captains.  Some unique options actually open up only AFTER a captain has died in your legacy.\n\n2) The majority of profitable opportunities, particularly in the early game, comes from story dialogue and missions.  Pick up trade opportunities and strange cargo, and don't be afraid to sail off the edge of your explored map to look for new ports.  Eventually, you'll find some significant money-making options that don't necessarily require active missions.\n\n3)  Compile a port report at every port you visit.  Pass by ports en route to your destination even if you don't have to.  The admiralty is an excellent source of 'living expenses' and fuel, every time you return to London.  Selling intelligence is a major source of income in this game.  Make sure to always ask the Admiral for special requests.\n\n4)  Similarly, don't be afraid to multi-task.  If someone is paying you a couple hundred echoes to carry them to a port on the far end of the map, look at your chart for opportunities along the way.  Visit as many ports as you can, explore, compile reports, and pick up / cash in requests en route.\n\n5) Be aware of the 'Something awaits you in port' icon on the lower left, near the text log of events.  It resembles a lit street lamp.  Essentially, there are actions you can take in every port (London included) that can only be done once per game day.  This is to prevent spamming some profitable exploration/visit options.  Whenever you see that icon pop up, see if you can drop by a nearby port to take advantage.  Also, if you're confused as to why an option isn't appearing, it's usually because that icon isn't there.\n\n\nThe short of it is that this is a sailing adventure game where the usual margin-trading and privateering strategies do not apply.  The story and atmosphere features heavily in one's enjoyment of it.  If you're unwilling or ill-inclined to embrace the game's gradual unfolding and read all the (sometimes voluminous) text that comes before you, then you're unlikely to enjoy Sunless Sea.  But if you're willing to plunge into the deep, take risks, and embrace the immersion and atmosphere of the narrative, then you'll have a good time in the Unterzee.","February 14, 2015","true","40.1"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","1"

While it is true that I have not explored the mid game or late game content of this game (which is also why I did not write anything about them, this '4 hours on record' also says the game (at its current state) has discouraged me enough to stop investing time on it after 4 hours. Mostly because of the slow game pace (feeling of making no progress).\n\nDisclaimer: This is a neutral review, not saying the game is bad or anything WHEN IT COMPLETES. It has potential, ok? (Gosh, I hate this word... 'potential'). But yea, for new players; if you are looking to enjoy a good game and pay $17.09 or $18.99 for it ... you might want to check out this and other 'negative reviews' first.\n\nBefore we go on, keep in mind this game is charging us $18.99 ... i bought it for $17.09, but still, expensive.\nEspecially when you compare it with Faster than Light (FTL) (10$ full price... constantly on 50% off discount coz it's an 'old game' now), which I will constantly compare this game with.\n\nWhy would I compare this game with FTL?\nBoth games are text based exploring RPG genre. At least 3 categories fit, why not?\n\nLet's talk about what I like about Sunless Sea first.\n1. Exploring element\n\nYou get to sail/zail, and you have full control over your sailing/zailing; something I like a lot (this beats FTL, coz FTL is one direction and multiple choice, that's all the exploring you get).\nThe course plotting from player, despite being provided with full freedom, is balanced by the need to estimate/calculate risk that one may encounter during the zail (strong monsters and gaining 'terror' ... a game mechancis that makes bad things happen to you if it gets too high). This creates a reasonable difficulty scaling environment for the players whlie not taking away any of the freedom of control from us.\n\n2. Fascinating World Settings (Dark and dangerous atmosphere, fitting the title 'Sunless Sea' perfectly)\n\nI personally enjoyed reading the text/plot a lot, even tho English is not my first language. Good read really, and helps immersion much. I don't think not knowing the plots (from another game with same world settings) before will create problem to new players. Since i'm one myself.\n\n3. Game's art and music has done right, helps players' immersion.\n\nEven tho I don't think they're consistent enough. As in, sometimes they show, sometimes they don't. Gets dull when there's no music (even background noise, please.) This I have to bring up FTL. The game always have music, different music for different scenario, all of them well made too. (Just my 2 cents on this, if you care less about music then just go ahead and appreciate the colourful arts).\n\n\nWhat I DO NOT LIKE about Sunless Sea*\n\nI'll mention something that many other players/reviews have mentioend first\n\n1. Economy\n\nTrading is broken/incomplete atm, grinding takes forever. This harms the fun player may gain/enjoy from exploring/zailing, also has negative impact on difficulty scaling. I.E Play time increases but you're not moving forward by much. Every now and then you get to spend 500 echo/coins on an upgrade and then you're broke again, with increasing difficulty to earn money. More importantly, getting that single piece of upgrade will not give you obvious edge against foes you previously can't defat/struggle to defeat. Meaning, you're still gonna lose a lot of hp or other resources, which you will have to pay to recover.... and then the bad cycle repeats itself.\n\n2. Gameplay\n\nFTL beats this game on this, hands down. FTL's combat is always engaging, timing and multitask, keeping you busy and planning multiple things all the time. This game seems to want to do the same by providing you with the same 'pause' function between planning, but there's simply no such need to have that function unless the player really wants to take it eassssssssssssyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy (as in, very very casual. No harm to have this function at all of coz.)\n\nSo, what's wrong with the gameplay of this game? To be more specific; combat.\n\n2a. Enemy variety not enough\nOnly 3 enemies for early game, and then a few more 'advanced' enemies... you can tell they're advanced by their looks, but that's all you know;\n\n2b. Not enough info on enemies\nThe game does not provide you with anything to let player know how strong is that thing you're fighting until you engage your enemy in combat.... and if you're unlucky, you die, start over... what's the point to punish players like this I wonder? (Looking at FTL, they provide players with options to gain info and still make the combat fun, engaging and challening. Charging almost double the price, I wonder why aren't the devs doing the same if not similar)\n\n2c. Skill uses resources that hurt the exploring aspect of the game\nYou use fuels to make effective evasive moves. Meaning you're going back to London sooner if you use those moves... yep, that totally makes exploring fun.. not. Alternative/recommendation would be giving abilities starting cooldowns or adding conditions to the ability before they are available in combat (such as illumination level must be high/low enough).\n\n2d. Weapon/attack methods variety not enough (both yourself and enemies, you have basically only 1 damaging method, and before that, you launch 2 flares.... that's basically what you do against EVERYTHING you'd fight in early game... somtimes you launch 3 flares, in another wrod, always the same pattern.... boring. I wonder why couldn't I have a skip button to skip this meaningless combat session an djust.. get the loot already. "Come on, game! You know i'm 100% gonna win and 100% my enemy will not be able to hurt me. Be a bro and don't waste time please!"\n\n3. Exploring....after you died once.\n\nWhen all the islands remain at the same place after you start over, it really feels like a big timesink for nothing when you zail, and totally takes aways the fun of exploring from players. Hell, I won't even need a map anymore. Would be nice if they can at least change the positions of islands a bit and help players to find meaning in exploring... or changes other thigns up a bit, like enemies vareity whatnot (FTL has nebula, hostile sectors and stuff like, effectively providing both level variety an maintaining gameplay/system integrity at the same time... no fun taken away, nothing is compromised).\n\nSo... tl;dr (in conclusion, as in)\n\nFascinating settings and stories, but not everything is completed so don't expect a fulfilling experience.\nGameplay is subpar atm. Strongest gameplay element of Sunless Sea* is exploring, but it's gimped by a broken/imcomplete trading system and BORING, BORING AND UNENGAGING SEA/ZEE ENCOUNTERS. (might as well make me dodge moving cyclones or icebergs, really, that at least tests my zailing skills). O yea I frogot to mention, the ship controling feels pretty neat, that's good... +0.5 points.\n\nSo uh, if you are seriously serious in helping the devs, do go ahead and pay 17.09-18.99 dollars for this, even for this Early Acess version, it has its perks.\nBUT, if you are like me who was looking for a really fun game to play..... game is not completed, so hold your horses, 'no.' You will not get what you're looking for.\n\nLastly, dear devs; even for 17.09, the game really is quite expensive. I wonder if it's because of the plot writing. You'd better beef up the exploring experience or make the combat of the game engaging at least if you don't want your faituful audience throw tomatoes at you.\n\n* = Sunless Sea at its current state (early access)","July 7, 2014","false","5.6"," 8 of 13 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","8","13","0","0"

Despite a lovely theme and fun-enough writing, the game is simply ****interminably SLOW****.  The ship moves at a snail's pace.  This does not support anything -- it's not tactical and it's not really atmosphere building.  It's just poor design.\n\nI really WANT to play the game, but I put in an hour and have a small number of text interactions to show for it.  Not worth it if you value the hours in your day -- not without *serious* redesign. :/  (a charting system, similar to the original Strange Adventures in Infinite Space; with pausing for spontaneously discovered hazards/monsters for instance -- but I don't think this will change at this point sadly).\n\nIt's not helped that combat is intellectually uninteresting.  It's not bad.  It's just forgetable.\nWhich leaves you waiting long periods for a very small number of brief text blurbs that just aren't worth it.  The problem is amplified by the fact that the game rewards you for repeatedly sailing back and forth to London, so you're not even getting a regular stream of new material.

While that doesn't get rid of having to manage everything and trying to figure out how all the ports relate to each other, but it does allow you to experiment and take risks without worrying about losing everything and starting over.\n\nThe game will last you a long time, since there is a lot to learn and you will most likely have to restart the game a few times before you figure out how it all works.\n\nThe game looks and runs great in general, but for some reason it just seems to struggle at max settings even on a very good computer. This is especially odd when the requirements for the game is so low.\n\nIf I were to give the game an update, I don't exactly want to make the game easier, but the amount of time it takes to sail anywhere just seems to take too long, especially earlier on when you have a weak engine. As long as fuel and supply usage was adjusted properly, there shouldn't be any problem in making the game go faster. It probably doesn't help that the game runs at 40 instead of 60 FPS, so in theory getting it to work faster might actually make the gameplay go faster as well.\n\nVideo showing some basic gameplay:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JsRA-LCNGrA\n\nFollow my curator list for future early access game recommendations:\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/curator/6856568-Should-You-Play-This-Game/","February 6, 2015","true","14.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

There is a lot of depth to the stories, and plenty of choices to be made. Many will lead to bad, but amusing results. An example from my most recent death:\n\nI wandered too far away from friendly ports, and ran out of fuel and supplies. Bobbing in the dark my crew grew hungry, ate the vermin on board, and then turned to cannibalism. Finally an angry glowing bob wandered nearby, and I tried to hunt it in the slim chance I could get supplies from its corpse. However, once it was badly wounded it just floated a good distance away, taunting me. Finally, with half my crew having been turned into supper, I abandoned ship for the lifeboats.\n\nBefore this would be the end for my captain, but miraculously I survive and make it to port! I lost all my crew and cargo, but I still have my officers, and a small ship with just enough supplies to make it back to Fallen London. Hoping to turn my fortune around I set off, and soon I reach the relative safety of home waters. Just a little bit more until I'm safe, but a giant crab emerges from the shadows and starts to approach.\n\nMy tiny little ship is about as sturdy as tinfoil, and so as the crab charges I put the engines at full speed to just dodge out of the way. The game has warned me that this might cause my engine to explode, but I've been fortunate thus far and so I figure it's a safe bet. Murphy loves moments like this...\n\nMy engines explode, but I manage to put out the flames quickly and only lose one crew member. That one crew member being my captain. So another unfortunate soul never returns home, and is quickly replaced by my next captain.","February 6, 2015","true","32.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I love the atmosphere of the Unterzee, interacting with the world is fun, and I really enjoy the way each playthrough feels like an entire new adventure with a completely different objective and character. The gameplay requires patience; a lot of it will consist of you sailing/zailing around in an effort to find something. The combat is somewhat iffy. I don't love it, but I don't hate it. It, like the game itself, is difficult and usually dependant on circumstance. In one of my playthroughs, I was low on fuel and trying to just make it to port so I could buy some more fuel, when one of those living icebergs got in my way and chased me until I ran out of fuel, which naturally resulted in my character perishing.  In another playthrough, I rarely encountered something I couldn't handle by hiding or fighting and managed to last much longer than I had before. The game is very challenging and even unfair at times, but that's part of what makes it so enjoyable. Knowing that you could meet your untimely end with a single wrong course of action really manages to keep you on your toes while also being somewhat exhilerating.\n\nWith all that being said, there is one thing I really don't like; the economy. Attaining money/echoes in Sunless Sea is too difficult, in my opinion. You get paid hardly anything for doing most things and the cost of fuel and supplies is outrageous at most ports. Best case scenario is you break even, being able to afford what you need to survive with what you've earned but not gaining any ground. Eventually, you die due to lack of ability to pay for the essentials and spend your last couple minutes watching your fuel and/or supplies dwindle down to zero. I find myself unable to explore for very long or venture too far from London thanks to the insane prices and lack of sufficient income. If the cost of essentials was lowered or the payout of doing things raised, the game would be much more enjoyable. In my opinion, of course. It could be that I'm just awful and haven't completely figured out how to actually gain ground. :P\n\nIn conclusion, I'm really having a good time with Sunless Sea. Adventuring and discovering the world is super great, I just wish I could feel like I'm actually moving up in the world instead of continuing until I eventually run out of money and find myself at sea/zea knowing full well that I have no hope of surviving due to my fatal lack of fuel and/or supplies.\n\nEDIT: After considerable more play time (roughly seven more hours), I would like to state my renewed opinion on Sunless Sea's economy.\n\nThe economy. It's not as difficult or unfair as I said, not even close. I dunno about everyone else, but after I kind of pushed through my phase of not knowing what the hellw as going on or what to do, it all started to make much more sense. I started to get a better grasp on what was happening and how the economy worked. It's not broken or unfair. It may feel that way for the first few hours, but eventually you start to get the gist of it. Sure, it's tough. Getting ahead and making profit is not easy, but the game wouldn't be much of a challenge if it was. So if you're having difficulty, as I was, just persist. If you keep dying, try something new. Don't start every character off doing the exact same thing. And once you round that curve of difficulty, you'll find that that is where the game really starts.\n\nGood luck my fellow/potential zailors!","January 22, 2015","true","30.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Best case scenario is you break even, being able to afford what you need to survive with what you've earned but not gaining any ground. Eventually, you die due to lack of ability to pay for the essentials and spend your last couple minutes watching your fuel and/or supplies dwindle down to zero. I find myself unable to explore for very long or venture too far from London thanks to the insane prices and lack of sufficient income. If the cost of essentials was lowered or the payout of doing things raised, the game would be much more enjoyable. In my opinion, of course. It could be that I'm just awful and haven't completely figured out how to actually gain ground. :P\n\nIn conclusion, I'm really having a good time with Sunless Sea. Adventuring and discovering the world is super great, I just wish I could feel like I'm actually moving up in the world instead of continuing until I eventually run out of money and find myself at sea/zea knowing full well that I have no hope of surviving due to my fatal lack of fuel and/or supplies.\n\nEDIT: After considerable more play time (roughly seven more hours), I would like to state my renewed opinion on Sunless Sea's economy.\n\nThe economy. It's not as difficult or unfair as I said, not even close. I dunno about everyone else, but after I kind of pushed through my phase of not knowing what the hellw as going on or what to do, it all started to make much more sense. I started to get a better grasp on what was happening and how the economy worked. It's not broken or unfair. It may feel that way for the first few hours, but eventually you start to get the gist of it. Sure, it's tough. Getting ahead and making profit is not easy, but the game wouldn't be much of a challenge if it was. So if you're having difficulty, as I was, just persist. If you keep dying, try something new. Don't start every character off doing the exact same thing. And once you round that curve of difficulty, you'll find that that is where the game really starts.\n\nGood luck my fellow/potential zailors!","January 22, 2015","true","30.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Good story. Good intrigue, mystery, and it keeps you playing and it's great overall for its story and atmosphere, but there's a few flaws the developers need to fix before I'de reccomend getting this game:\n\n1. There's not enough money in the game world (not enough from rewards, sales, et cetera), and everything is extremely expensive as a result. Better engines make your ship go faster, but burn up fuel like no tomorrow, so it's not worth it. Even when doing high-rewarding quests, you'll usually only turn a small profit or break even, so getting started is also difficult.\n\n2. Enemies are horribly overpowered. Most ships can one hit kill you, while an iron score of 75 takes three hits to bring them down. Get used to save-scumming. This is probably the biggest issue of the entire game, and probably the easiest to fix, just decrease the absurd damage ratios please.\n\n3. Experience points and levels (or "fragments" and "secrets" as the game calls them) are plentiful at the beginning as you explore, but quickly drop off due to exploration being finite. What inevitably follows is meandering from port to port, looking for challenges to toss a handful of experience points at a time your way. This wouldn't be so bad if the rewards weren't on the small side. Many experience-rewarding challenges require high skills to complete, and how do you get skills? By getting experience, of course! This results in a lot of the game revolving around patiently grinding tiny quests.\n\nThis experience system could be fixed by making experience levels increase your stats by more than just one point at a time, or perhaps rewarding more experience...\n\nI have confidence that the developers can fix this, as they fixed the terror system's rate of increasing. Before Steel, the terror meter used to shoot up at a rate of about one dot every second, meaning even a simple hop from the coast of one island to another could net you a few terror points, and since everything is expensive, reducing terror by way of shore leave or resting at the docks was almost out of the question. Thankfully, this has been resolved by the Steel update. Maybe the next update will fix the above three issues.\n\nOverall, good game, 7.5/10 right now, heavily weighed down by an almost-unsurvivable economy, god-tier bandits, and a dramatic slowdown of progress once you run out of islands to explore.\n\nPS: Don't try sending captured ships home with a skeleton crew. Even if it says it's an 80% chance of success, the odds are more like 50/50%, and the rewards currently aren't high enough to justify the risk.","October 9, 2014","true","152.4"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

You have a rusty old steamer with a small dysfunctional crew. Failure invariably awaits you, while rare small successes will make you question your integrity. Pace is slow by design, and there is no immediate overarching storyline to speak of - though further into the game tiny bits of story will start building up to something larger, like lego blocks.\n\nIf you can tolerate all these things, you may love this game. If you prefer your games to be dynamic, focused and immediately rewarding, stay away.\n\nIf you still decide to purchase it, keep two things in mind about gameplay: don't focus on wholesale trading outside of quests and don't rush to upgrade your ship. Stealthy captains running small errands on their starter ships until almost endgame are going to have a much smoother experience. Also, as others have mentioned, try Fallen London for a sample of Failbetter writing.","August 8, 2015","true","141.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

This game is so artfully made, so eloquent, and with the best unexpected humor, to call it a masterpiece would be a trivial compliment in scale to how fantastic this game truly is. The gameplay is everything I could hope for in a sea (or zee) captaining experience, not to mention with a lore unlike any other, so convoluted and enigmatic, yet more satisfying and wholesome than a chest full of riches. The story and mysterious world surrounding this game are by far the greatest I have ever encountered so far in a game, yet to the initial few playthroughs, hidden. Its one that is initially unseen and unspoken, yet once you find it, its like the Neath itself, unfathomably extensive and mysterious. The only negative aspect I have to say is that the game isnt easy, and I dont mean that as in it's unfair or that I simply cant play well, it's the fact that while youre exploring and learning more and more, you are at a constant struggle to survive. There is no simple farming for money, there are no quick tips to beat difficult enemies, theres not even a constant map over your multiple captains' lifetimes. So if you enjoy a real challenge, a unmatched immersive story, and have a hankering to be a hardened, monster-wrangling, zee-loving gentleman fighting to survive in an industrial revolutionary underground ocean, there is no better game for you than Sunless Sea!","May 15","true","25.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, the feel of the game so far is damn good. Although the game is quite challenging, the feel of the game is great. Given the game is not done yet and there is a fair bit of content missing, their is an interesting balance of stats and characters. The game is stable although it could use higher resolution settings. All in all the game is engaging, entertaining, sometimes a little unerving I am most certainly enjoying the hell out of this game.

For those who like gothic London or steampunk-ish themed games as well as exploration and trading games I would say its a maybe, possibly you should wait for the full release. For those that like action, jump-horror or simulations I cannot recommend this.\nThe game play is slow and atmospheric with you piloting your steam ship around the strange and sometimes alien underzea ( the name of the setting for the game) visiting ports and completing minor missions which are usually (at this stage) simple fetch quests. There are also RPG elements with several stats to raise which can affect the success of your choices as well as combat which takes the form of a slow mini game, almost like a card game.\nThere are however several issues to note.\n-The game is incredibly text heavy, if you're a "picture is worth a thousand words" person you may want to skip it.\n-Combat is quite frankly a little dull. The developer has promised to change it but as it stands it's not a high point.\n-Trading is not particularly satisfying, prices are static and profit margins are generally tiny to the point that it barely covers costs often you will have to resort to a FAQ or forum to work out how to make decent money.\n-Your terror meter fills fast in the open zea (which is classed as anything more than a ship length from shore) to the tune of something like 1 terror point every 1.5 seconds its not insurmountable and it does force you to consider your routes and adds tension still, the rate it fills at plus it's cost to lower can be an annoyance.\n\nAll in all I have enjoyed the game but the number of issues makes it hard to whole heartedly recommend.","July 22, 2014","true","62.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As strange and comically-sinister as it is, it's really easy to buy into it.\n+ Writing is absolutely fantastic and is the heart and soul of the game.\n+ Art is evocative, goes hand-in-hand with the prose style to create the game's unique atmosphere of wonder, whimsy, and dread.\n+ As of the time of this review, new content is being added regularly (new stories), and an expansion is on the way.\n\nMeh:\n\n= While the writing is good, once you've read through certain quest texts, you will probably simply click on your usual option and skip over the text on subsequent playthroughs.\n= It's a reader's game. If you prefer less text in your games, you might want to give this one a miss.\n= You will find items, meet people, and have no idea how they will be relevant. Where do you sell what item? Personally, the trial-and-error nature of it all is an enjoyable part of the experience but it could easily annoy other players.\n\nCons:\n\n- Early game is extremely, painfully repetitive. Since dying is so easy in this game, you have to restart and play the same quests in the same areas many many times.\n- The combat is functional but not at all enjoyable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gallente/recommended/304650/","gallente","wormroom","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gallente/","378 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPre-release update as of 2/4: Played it again to check out what changed since my review. Still Cthulu's Oregon Trail with great writing. Worth your money for the uniqueness of experience alone.\n\nIf you've ever played something like Escape Velocity, you'll feel right at home with Sunless Sea. It combines the neat world-building of Fallen London with a survival-ish roguelike-like. I really like this game, but I'd like anyone who buys it to understand why I like it before they make their decision.\n\nThe gameflow in Sunless Sea is surprisingly natural. All port interactions are menu-based. You'll spend most of your time at sea. Most of your time away from port will be spent managing your fuel, supplies, and terror. The concept behind the game relies on the fact that the sun makes the ocean beautiful, and setting sail into a vast, wet expanse isn't quite as romantic as our concept of the merchant marine.\n\nInstead, you spend most of your time at sea trying to navigate between lit buoys, the shore, and trying to avoid the pitch dark that will freak the heck out of your crew. Exploring new islands and picking up quests earns you cash, new crew members, and the experience that translates into varied rewards.\n\nWhere the game really shines is in cohesiveness. You don't get on a boat in Fallen London because you're a hero. You do it because you're broke, desperate, or stupid. The game's systems support this entirely. Most of the money you'll be getting comes from military commissions looking for news from far-off ports, looting hostile ships, and any number of unique events that can occur at one of the game's many islands.\n\nMy main issue with Fallen London, gating the content by limiting the player's actions, actually translates into something really neat in The Sunless Sea. You can't try every activity a port has to offer in one visit, because being out to sea for a reasonable (a minute, maybe? probably less) amount of time gives you the "Something Awaits You" trait. This trait means that you can do something at the next port. After you've done the thing, you'll only have access to the regular port facilities. My instinct when I play games like this is to only start caring when there's a decision to be made, but making my choices matter means that I engage with the game in a much more active way.\n\nThe writing is great. Nothing else to say about it!\n\nFinally, this game is cool because it's an early access title that will be released. Buying it now gives you a great opportunity to try a limited version of the game out, but the developer's sensical timetable should mean that we'll be getting the full version in October. The game isn't complete yet, but I think the most important thing an early access title can do is launch after it knows exactly what it is.\n\nThis won't be a different game after it's launched, there will just be more cool stuff in it.","July 22, 2014","true","13.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The writing, exquisite. Oh, the things you'll do. Nothing makes you feel a zee-captain quite like eating a chunk of your First Officer's flesh. Or making a sacrifice to the gods of the Zee. Smuggling sunlight to sell at the pirate ports. Trading stories of distant shores and tales of terror. Hunting the beasts that tower over the largest ships.\n\nNow, the main problem with this game is the tedium. Gaining money in this game is a chore, trading between the ports yields very little profit, and the grind is essential and unavoidable. The enemy AI is terrible - it's really easy to abuse it, which in its own twisted way is helpful, considering how often you'll kill things in hopes of a decent drop.\n\nTLDR: Every story in Sunless Sea is thrilling, witty and charming. But the game itself is tedious and slow-paced; if you can cope with that, you will absolutely love it.","February 24, 2015","true","14.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

After the initial tutorial, you are expected to add to what you have been taught and be ready for even more as the game goes on. With an incredible aesthetic that includes a wonderful soundtrack, a fantastically grim art style, and plenty of character in the story, fans of Lovecraft and dark humor may find it compelling. The gameplay has deeper complexities, but on the surface functions simply enough to be understood at a glance. Hotkeys are available and controls are configurable, though the range of actual keys needed is simple enough and will not leave casual players swamped in things to remember. Experienced explorers are rewarded with a map that never stays the same unless you pass your chart down to a successor upon either death or retirement. Retiring offers unique benefits to the next character in which they start with elevated stats, extra money, or extra equipment, potentially a combination of the options if you followed a certain storyline to completion. Making money is not too easy, though with how the economy in the game works, the early gameplay can be tedious, as travel time eats up more time than time spent in ports. However, as you begin to comprehend the mechanics and amass wealth, upgrades don’t make the game very easy, but instead make it possible to survive and go further in the game itself.\n\nUltimately, I recommend the game if for nothing than the story and music alone. The gameplay is solid, if a bit slow paced, and as you grow the understand the mechanics behind the game itself, it opens up further and further for you to enjoy. It has a learning curve that can be brutal on the impatient but given enough time and patience, the game can immerse you in a world of intrigue and curiosity. As this is the sister game to Fallen London, I recommend checking out Fallen London for those curious about the stories in London that don’t make it into Sunless Sea. For those that also enjoy Fallen London, Sunless Sea is a natural extension of the game. Both games unlock content for one another after a certain point and enables interactions between your Sunless Sea and Fallen London character.","February 6, 2015","true","147.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

However, I still haven't seen probably over 50% of the end-game content this game has to offer. Another thing to bare in mind is that at first, it may seem slow-paced, which I couldn't stand the first hour or so playing the game.

We have wandered far from God!) because the next thing I knew I was staring down the grimmest version of a Monopoly opportunity card I've ever seen: a mutiny that, if failed, ends the game, with two choices for quashing it--fighting it out tooth and claw (30% chance to succeed) and administering negotions (18% chance to succeed).\n\nSomehow, I survived the rebellion, only to find that the mutineers had a lot of good reasons to die for what they tried to do. I hadn't brought nearly enough supplies to feed even the three surviving, misguidedly-loyal crew members, and no cash to buy more in any nearby port on this bleak ♥♥♥-end of cavernous ocean. At this point, the recent purchase of my new ship was looking a little more like a sunk cost for a literal sinking. We crawled back west, toward home, without the crew to move at more than half speed, with the light out to conserve engine fuel despite the roaring dark all around, and were soon forced to stoop to the indelicate task of eating one of the crew to keep what little remained of our wits about us.\n\nIt became a matter of judiciously choosing where to port next, either at a port I had intended to visit on the first draft of a long-dead travel itinerary to trade a ship component for supplies, or chance a detour that would guarantee one fuel and one supply item for the crew to eat. I chose the latter, unrepentantly brave as always. We coasted into port on fumes and were greeted by the wharfsmen with a single ration for the crew to split, and we cruised in relative half-starved comfort to the next port and took a sweet $250 for the resold ship component, and my horrifying gamble and only day as a competent ship captain was looking pretty good.\n\nWith restored provisions, we drifted southwest two days, cursing breathily and repeatedly as we desperately steered wide berths around pirates and abyssal crabs, finally chugging into our home port with a fresh salty scent, weeping scars, and ageless nightmares of eyes staring out from the infinite black above, muttering in unpronouncable jargon all the apocryphal horror a gaggle of human craniums could hold before eating a buckshot breakfast.\n\nThe Admirality was swooned with my descriptions of Monkey Island. With the payout, you better ♥♥♥♥ing believe I bought an expensive townhome and wrote a will.","January 2","true","47.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","0"

A very slow, grindy simulator . You start off with a ship, a crew, and a meager sum of money. There are multiple ways of increasing this sum of money, but all of them revolve around sailing from one point on the map to another. Occassionally you must dodge underground sea monsters and insane pirates, but most of the time you'll be watching your fuel and supply gauges slowly tick downwards while the terror creeps up.\n\nSure, you can fight sea monsters, but good luck doing so with the basic ship and weapon, because those barely do squat against even the weakest of monsters. And if you do manage to kill them, the rewards won't pay for the repairs you will need to make for your hull. If you want to fight monsters, or do any of the fun missions in the game, you will need to copious amounts of money. Unfortunately, money is extremely hard to come by, especially at the start when you have no idea what you should be doing.\n\nI don't usually turn to online guides to figure out how to play a game, but for Sunless Sea it's pretty much essential as the game does an exceptionally poor job at telling you what you should be doing. On just about every level, Sunless Sea moves at a glacial pace. In order to make enough money, or raise your stats high enough, in order to accomplish the more fun things the game has to offer, you will need to bide you time and grind.\n\nPort reports and quests will only get you so far, as the main source of income comes buying resources in one port and selling them in another for incremental profit. While there are a few ways of making lots of money in a short period of time, you will be cut off from them after a while, often times with little forewarning.\n\nThe combat itself is nothing to write home about either, and is pretty lackluster. Even with some of the more powerful weapons, fastest engines, or bigger and better boats, it is a pretty bland structure of 'keep the enemy within firing range'.\n\nSo given all these pretty damning statements, why am I giving it my recommendation?\n\nWell, what the game does right, it does phenomenally well. The writing is utterly incredible, painting a tapestry of this world and your place in it with evocative prose. And the world itself equally stunning, suffused with an air of mystery that becomes ever more expansive the more you dig into it. There is truly a sense that everyone you meet, and every where you go, has a deep an intricate backstory that ties into the greater narrative of this strange underwater sea and its equally bizarre denizens. The visuals themselves are simplistic, but tell entire stories through appearance alone. For that reason and that reason alone, I give this game my recommendation.\n\nLike I said at the beginning, this is not a game for everyone. It is boring, repetitive and a grindfest, but its an eloquently written grindfest with excellent worldbuilding. If you don't mind doing a lot of reading, then there is a lot to get out of this game. If not, than this isn't the game for you.","January 23","true","47.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

It's by the same folks—and set in the same world—as Fallen London.\n\nAnd it is the world, more than anything, which makes the game so captivating. With a distinctly Lovecraftian feel, London has fallen underground, and lies on the edge of a dark subterranean sea. You are a ship's captain, and while you can trade in physical goods like coffee and wine, it becomes rapidly apparently that what's most widely valued on the shores of the unterzee are *stories*.\n\nMemories of distant lands, the heart-thumping excitement of a sea-monster rearing from the depths, the memories of having tea with a most civilised devil, a vision of the surface where the sun is said to still shine... all of these can be traded. And while it's never explicitly mentioned in the game, it's clear that they are traded *permanently*.\n\nA secret in the unterzee has a real value, because in sharing that secret with another, you lose the memory of it yourself. It's said there are far-off islands with marketplaces for memories and forgotten tales. And as a captain of a ship upon a dark and terrifying sea, one can fetch a high price for some of the memories of what you have seen...\n\nI cannot stop playing this game, late at night, with the lights dimmed, and a leather bound journal and fountain pen close at hand.","February 27","true","36.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Honestly though, it was the price tag (I believe it was 25€ at some point) what made me doubt that this game is worth the money. And boy, it is.\n\nStorytelling - 10/10\nArtstyle - 9/10\nAudio - 9/10\nGameplay - 8/10\nReplayability - 6/10\n\nNow don't get me wrong, this game is packed with awesome writing and original stories. It's that once you make 20+ characters (which I did at some point), you already know half the stories that will be faced against you. It doesn't make them any less great, but it's like watching the same movie over and over, so after that many characters you probably won't be too eager to start a new one.. However, I still haven't seen probably over 50% of the end-game content this game has to offer. Another thing to bare in mind is that at first, it may seem slow-paced, which I couldn't stand the first hour or so playing the game. After a while I got used to it, and I felt it actually made me think about the direction my crew and I are heading, and embrace the Unterzee even more..

Every location you visit has its own story where you get to choose how things play out, almost like a choose your own adventure novel. The choices you have are based on the resources you collect and your stats. The stories are excellently written and really play out in different ways depending on the choices you make.\n\n+ You also must manage fuel, supplies and fear. Mismanaging any of these resources to a large degree will result in death. Surviving the sea can be a daunting task, between managing resources, avoiding/attacking enemies or making the wrong choice in a story just adds to the danger you face.\n\n+ Collect money to buy new ships, weapons, engines, resources etc.\n\n+ Certain locations are randomized every game\n\n+ You can select your own victory conditions at the beginning of the game.\n\n+ Soundtrack\n\n\nAverage:\n\nThe game is REALLY slow paced and may not be suitable for every gamers tastes. It takes a long time to really gather money and start making progress unless you exploit some of the games mechanics. Ships also travel slowly to build tension but also adds to the tedium of travel.\n\n\nThe Bad:\n\nThe game crashed on me a lot and nothing but a hard reset would fix the problem often causing my save file to become corrupt.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nUnlike other Rogue games this game takes a long time to complete a single play through depending on skill level. The sea is harsh, cruel, and dying is common place, but if you can stick through the bad times you may realize the game is a lot of fun.\n","April 17","true","13.9"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Quick word of warning is that this is not an action game, combat is a "real time card game" when you collide with an enemy and most of your choices are left to luck same as in Fallen London, put these two things together and you have a very difficult time in the world but it also adds atmosphere and pushes the need to survive rather than fight everything you see, making money is fairly difficult until you have situated yourself with the west coastline and memorized the main harbors there. The middle of the map is a cluster of a few different locations that move every time you die so you won't see the same places every time you play or memorize the entire map.\n\nI found the best part of this game for myself was simply sailing east listening to the music enjoying the artwork.\nI found the worst part of this game for myself being that nobody wanted to by my crate of souls and my crew would mutiny seconds before pulling into port and lady-luck telling me there is no comeback in a "25% chance of success" situation which caused me to fail at progressing in any story at all, but perhaps when I learn more about how the game works I will be able to trick it into letting me continue.\n\nReading the road-map I think this game has a lot of potential to become a great sailing game, maybe up there with sid meiers pirates.","July 1, 2014","true","53.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I think development slowed down a little bit, and the combat rework definitely put a kink in things though it was worth the time. I think Sunless Sea might fall a little short of some of its development goals at release but it's still worth the price. It's an enjoyable story-based sea adventure with some decent twitch action, exploration and an interesting world to get into it and find out about, and which holds up to several replays. The pace is fairly sedate so it's a good game to chill out with for an evening.\n\n-------\n\nSet in the bizarre, grim and quirky world of Fallen London, Sunless Sea is a great game for people who like exploration, text adventure-style gameplay, and randomness. Dark and Gothic but with a gentlemanly twist, its art is lavish and its music and sound effects ooze flavor. It's a surprisingly relaxing game to play too, driting through the Zee in the darkness, the waves lapping against your hull. It has roguelike qualities, can be played hard or softcore, and can be fairly punishing.\n\nSunless Sea as a game is a model of what Early Access games should look and play like. Visibly polished gameplay and art, a lack of crippling bugs, instability, crashes, with plenty of room for mechanical tweaks and finding the sweet spot, because the developers are active on their forums and responding to feedback. Constant updates not only fixing bugs and polishing content, but adding new content on a frequent basis.","July 2, 2014","true","84.2"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

There is incredible potential in both the game itself and the game universe.\n\nThere is one, major, glaring flaw, however:\n\nTHE GRIND\n\nFrom very early on in the game, you discover that you need fuel and supplies to continue playing. How do you get fuel and supplies? By Grindng. How often do you Grind? You always Grind. Why? Because if you don't Grind, you don't live.\n\nImagine WoW if your level 90 Paladin could potentially starve to death every few minutes, and needed a constant stream of Lesser Wolf Meat in order to keep playing. Want to go on a raid? Uh, sorry, I can't ....I have to go grind for 30 minutes so my dude doesn't starve to death. That is, in a nutshell, the gameplay of Sunless Sea.\n\nIt's understandable why they did this. The game requies some kind of economy to keep things interesting and to keep you questing. There is a threshold, however, beyond which the GRIND stops being fun and starts to be a chore. Exploring a vast underground gothic hell-planet is fun. Making constant supply runs from port to port just so you can, maybe, one day, buy a level 3 spotlight so that you can possibly, somehow, defeat the Death Crab (or whatever) in between supply runs is.....\n\nWell, it feels more like *work* than an actual game. It feels like real life. Keep working so that you can live.\n\nBut I don't play games to feel like I'm at work. Therein lies the problem.\n\nDevs: please fix your crazy GrindFest so I can give you a good rating.

Even if it means dying a few times.\n\nWhile the naval combat is basic and quite easily exploited, the game really isn't about that. It's about exploring a well-developed, living world that will be shaped by your decisions. Rob Pigmote of its scintilliack? You're locked out for good. Side with the Anarchists? The Admiral goes into hiding. These are fairly tame compared to what awaits you further East.\n\nThe mechanics support this main theme. You level your stats with Secrets which are made by accumulating Fragments, which you gain every time you discover a new island or landmark. Various interactions also provide Secrets, but nothing replaces the rewards reaped from fully exploring the Sunless Sea.\n\nWhile it does have a slow start, this is deliberate and creates an impressively immersive experience. The soundtrack is great, and the art captures the mystery and dread the devs want you to feel. Some reviews point to how it eventually becomes a grind, but that has far more to do with the player than the game. In near 50 hours of gameplay and with all legacy items unlocked, I have yet to run a single grind.\n\nRegular updates mean I've returned multiple times and enjoyed the game once again. The recent Christmastide storyline was a lot of fun. And with the Zubmariner expansion around the bend, they're will be a lot more to explore (AN ENTIRE OTHER SEA!)\n\nRECAP\nThe writing, art, music, and general atmosphere are great.

Wound up with a useless hoard of memories sealed in stone, trying to find a port to drop it off at. Limped back to London and ran out of fuel, wounded myself in a vain attempt to gain the intercession of an old zee-god.\n\nGot a nice shiny diamond instead.\n\nSo I opened my box full of sunshine and perished in glowing cheery happiness.\n\n10/10 would sink beneath the waves again.\n\nTo put a more objective spin on it--this is great for its atmosphere and the surreal world that you get to explore. From there, it's a matter of playstyle (and how completionist you want to be). Will you ever fully explore the game? Probably not, unless you're willing to put 100+ hours into it. If you're not okay with that, then this game may not be for you. I'm not even sure that I'll complete all of the victory conditions.\n\nBut, for me, this game isn't about finishing anything in particular, it's about striking out into the dark, discovering new things, and coming to a fuller appreciation of the weird world. Can it get repetitive? Possibly. I mean, yes, the stories reset when you die. Though if you finish up a storyline on a previous captain, there's nothing that says your next captain has to explore the same island--just gather up a port report and move on. Your new captain has bigger things to do.\n\nIt's a game where you'll keep building larger and larger circles of gameplay, applying your lessons from failure to your future runs, knowing what places you can skip and how far you can afford to cast out beyond London. You'll learn to plan routes so that you can pick up Port Reports on the way out and back, to provide fuel and supplies for future runs. You'll work out the most efficient ways to achieve early objectives, only to be stymied by later ones. You'll stumble into great menaces, and be prepared for them the next time.\n\nAnd if the notion of paying terrible prices in order to achieve things like sailing off of every edge of the map intrigues you, this is your kind of game.","February 17, 2015","true","24.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","5","8","0","0"

I found it had a very steep learning curve but once I learned the ropes I discovered a wonderfully layered world with brilliant stories. I have sunk (heh) 80+ hours of gameplay into the world of Sunless Sea and I'm still learning and still discovering. I'm pursuing a different ambition and able to take the opposite options to what I chose last time around and there are lots of little details that I didn't pick up before. The more time I spend playing, the more I fall in love with it.\n\nThe story and atmosphere are the strongest aspects of the game, in my opinion. Each island has its own unique story, peeled away layer by layer with each visit. Islands which appear innocuous at first have hidden secrets. I felt genuine anxiety watching my fuel and supply gauges continue to drop miles from the nearest friendly port, knowing that having to detour to avoid a single zeebeast could cost me everything. All of your officers have their own motivations for joining you and while it's costly to help them, you gain huge benefits in the long run, as well as more richly flavoured story.\n\nI would consider the combat the weakest point of the game. Unless you need a specific item drop it's almost always safer and more economical to avoid combat altogether. Perhaps this is intentional as it's more realistic, but anyone hoping for a game filled with epic zee-battles with either be disappointed or frequently dead.\n\nNo previous knowledge from Fallen London is required, although I did find myself consulting forums and the wiki to get the background of some stories as information is fed rather piecemeal to give a slow reveal. This does give you motivation to continue returning to islands which don't, at first, appear to have much interesting happening on them.\n\nIt took about 60 hours of gameplay for me to finally succeed in permadeath mode, although others have done it in considerably less. I felt that towards the end I was shying away from dangerous encounters a lot for fear of losing my captain and I think I missed a lot because of that. I'm using manual save now and I feel a lot freer to make mistakes and to take chances, although I don't feel quite the same tension as before.\n\nSpecial shout-out to the soundtrack, which is amazing. It's melancholic and joyful and frightening in all the right ways.

The game should be about exploring the fantastic atmosphere, not scrabbling for fuel to keep yourself running. Instead of being scared of the denizens of the sea, you're scared of a fuel meter. Doesn't live up to the atmosphere, unfortunately. Use a different mechanic to keep London as the  central point - weave it into the quests or similar.","March 9, 2015","false","5.1"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

I would lov to see new events occure on Islands frequently. That would make every visit a bit more memorable and maybe add replay value. This unfortunitly isnt the case with the current build.\n\nIf there is one thing they did correctly, Its the atmosphere. For how small the map is, it's dreary colors and rather soothing music paint an facinating picture. I want to learn more about the world of Fallen Londen and all the islands within its deadly waters. I want to know what life is like in this world. See the pale faced people and hear the echo of horrors deep in the endless darkness.\n\n\nPROs:\nBeautiful and Mysterious world. So delicious it almost makes the game worth buying on it's own.\n\nCONs:\nBoring combat ruins the pace of the game. More content would do Sunless Sea well.\n\n\nIn the end... I think I can recommend this game... BUT wait for it to go on sale. There isn't enough to the game for it to be worth full price. Its an experiance unlike any other game I have played up to this point and YOU should experiance it too!","February 15, 2015","true","14.0"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

Imagine playing an older JRPG for instance, and restarting from the beginning if you happen to die and you see what sort of an issue this is. This is accidentally a better analogue than apparent, if you began thinking that JRPGs aren't particularly difficult.\n\nThis leads to skipping dialogue by default if you happened to die. This means skipping well crafted, and genuinely well written dialogue and somewhat interesting, if very disjointed and directionless story of this game. It's quite clear the writer(s) of this game were given the direction (if any) of "dark gritty steampunkish fantasy world where death really isn't a thing", and not much else. I want to like it, but it's literally an assortment of bits and pieces with little to no connectivity.\n\nThe graphics are... passable. It's almost like there were 2 or more artists, and they just phoned in on a style that neither handled perfectly well. A lot of the art assets, specifically most buildings on land look like programmer graphics or stock assets. I'm personally not partial to the often heavily photoshop filtered drawings neither, albeit occasionally they're very good. The actual location design is, however, varied and interesting, i just don't think it's very well represented by the graphic assets at their disposal.\n\nThis gets me to this games' greatest flaw, gameplay, or the lack of it.\nThe combat and survival: Unless you're completely clueless, or get screwed by the RNG, it's virtually impossible to die. Especially once you get the second ship, which doesn't take long at all if you're not averse to doing a few runs of what amounts to grinding. Pretty much every single ship in the game can barely harm you, because the AI is completely idiotic and as barebones as it gets, so you can just stay behind, at an angle if they have aft turret, and just peg away at them. They did patch the monster AI, but it's still very abusible if you know what you're doing.\n\nActual gameplay:\nDull dull dull. All you do is wait, most of the time you needn't pay any attention. It's one of those games where you basically have to play another game on the side to make it enjoyable. The quests you get are fetch-quests, which sort of makes sense story-wise, but isn't fun. The game doesn't tell you where to get anything most of the time though, which means you'll be staring at the wiki soon, and don't you just love those types of games? The possibly worst thing is that the sea, spelled 'zee' doesn't do anything at all. No waves, no wind, nothing. A pseudorandom pirate there, a pseudorandom monster here. If you want a good way to do long voyages interesting, you should've taken lessons from Uncharted Waters.\n\nTL;DR:\nA story driven atmospheric rogue-lite that ultimately fails to be any of those.\nThe good parts are the writing, and the sounds. The gameplay is, gently put, a bad joke.\n\nIf you're looking for a good ship-based adventure, look elsewhere. I personally recommend Uncharted Waters 2 on the SNES, if you're not up for that, Uncharted Waters Online isn't bad, if a bit impenetrable and dated.\n\nAverage playtime amongst friends and myself: 12.7 hours\nAbove figure removing the highest and lowest: 5.8 hours","June 14, 2015","false","22.4"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

It seriously takes 1/3 of a barrel of fuel just to exit the inner harbour of the starting port.\n\nIt's also definitely not a game about trading, because I swear, half the ports I went to didn't even have shops. Never mind shops that actually had things worth buying or selling.\n\nNaval battles are a frustrating joke, so if the game is about that, it's a really irritating game.\n\nI don't think it's a game about questing, because most of the quests I got wouldn't even tell me where I was supposed to go. "Here, smuggle this contraband for me." "Where?" "Over there. Watch out for port inspections while you have it." "Okay, how do I get there?" "..."\n\nSo what is this game about? This is a game about dying.\n\nThat's it. Go out, die, repeat. Eventually, you will be able to pass on something interesting after you die, like a weapon, or money. Once you're really good at dying, you'll be able to own a house. I mean, not you. You probably won't own a house, or if you do, you won't use it much. Your descendents will own a house, which they will (maybe) improve for whoever is in their will.\n\nActually, once you really figure out how to die, you can start the game with many of these hurdles already surpassed. For example, at the minor cost of only four starting captains, I began the game with a house, an ironclad will, 950 echoes (money, or roughly 9 times the normal starting amount), and the 2nd best gun available at the starting port.\n\nThe best part is that none of these captains ever left the port. I was literally able to accelerate my game by DYING IN THE STARTING PORT. If I wanted, I could have sent my captains off to die in some random corner of the sea (I mean, "go exploring"), at which point I would have had a massive advantage in knowing roughly where the various landmarks are, and what enemies lurk nearby.\n\nI'll probably keep playing it, which is to say I am going to keep killing my captains in the starting port, just to see how much stuff I can start the game with. Although maybe I already am playing the game. I hoenstly don't know.\n\nThe dialogue system is interesting, but the UI is a little messy. Interactions often have unexpected results. "Would you like some tea?" "Yes, I would." "Oh dear, the house is burning down. Unfortunate." "..."\n\nThe atmosphere is phenomenal. Would make a truly fantastic game about trading and exploring.\n\nDefinitely don't recommend, unless you've got a fetish for genealogy.","February 9, 2015","false","22.6"," 26 of 50 people (52%) found this review helpful 28 people found this review funny","52","26","50","28","0"

Lantern-buoys and light-ships are few and far between this far North. Being within sight of land...any land...seems to relax the tension that has been building on the ship. We cross over another abyss and I take care to keep my eyes on the horizon. You learn quickly not to look into such depths. Sometimes...the abyss stares back.\n\nI've supplemented our now meager rations with Zee-Bat jerky. Somewhere between the tomb-colonies and the Whither, we lost another crewmember. It's a shape-shifter, of that much I'm sure. It is among my crew, but all I have are baseless accusations. I can't afford to lose anyone else if I want to maintain our cruising speed. The less time we spend steaming in the dark the better. So all I can allow myself to hope is that the murderer continues to pull its weight.\n\nI dreamt of a wind in the depths, carrying something up. I fear I've spent too much time here. London used to call me home after a long voyage; a beer in a noisy pub, a smile from my love, all helped me forget the terror.

Gameplay is fairly simple -- you are the captain of a ship in the port of Fallen London, which sits on the edge of the Unterzee, a vast lightless ocean. You have to manage four resources: Money (Echoes), Food (supplies), Fuel (fuel), and Terror, all while exploring, making money and eventually retiring from Seafaring life.\n\nThe narratives are very well written and interesting, and there are a variety of overlapping stories. I'd almost describe the game as a survival horror experience, as it never quite feels like you have enough of anything.\n\nThe primary downside of the game is that it's in Early Access, and clearly not finished yet. Currently a lot of ports are not particularly functional (or clearly have the wrong shops and dialog options), but the art is very well done and everything you see is interesting (I always find myself wondering about the story behind the different areas). In addition it's difficult to make money, especially in bulk, when you start. I think these are balance issues that will eventually be resolved, as opposed to serious detractions of the game. If this were a 1.0 release I wouldn't recommend it, but as the game is in Early Access I certainly see the potential and that the 'good' far outweighs the 'bad'.\n\nIf you liked FTL and also like HP Lovecraft, buy this game.

A traveller might also encounter a wide array of peculiar personnages of often questionable and sometimes royal descent from fiery anarchists to solemn clergymen.\n\nThankfully a captain in waiting does not have to face the unknown hazards of the underzee alone. Fallen London attracts haunted and hunted individuals like a corpse draws flies and some of them might be willing to offer their services in exchange for passage or refuge on your vessel. A cautious traveller should keep in mind however, that they may hide obscure mysteries of their own.

Gameplay is fairly simple -- you are the captain of a ship in the port of Fallen London, which sits on the edge of the Unterzee, a vast lightless ocean. You have to manage four resources: Money (Echoes), Food (supplies), Fuel (fuel), and Terror, all while exploring, making money and eventually retiring from Seafaring life.\n\nThe narratives are very well written and interesting, and there are a variety of overlapping stories. I'd almost describe the game as a survival horror experience, as it never quite feels like you have enough of anything.\n\nThe primary downside of the game is that it's in Early Access, and clearly not finished yet. Currently a lot of ports are not particularly functional (or clearly have the wrong shops and dialog options), but the art is very well done and everything you see is interesting (I always find myself wondering about the story behind the different areas). In addition it's difficult to make money, especially in bulk, when you start. I think these are balance issues that will eventually be resolved, as opposed to serious detractions of the game. If this were a 1.0 release I wouldn't recommend it, but as the game is in Early Access I certainly see the potential and that the 'good' far outweighs the 'bad'.\n\nIf you liked FTL and also like HP Lovecraft, buy this game. You will not be disappointed.","October 30, 2014","true","300.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Lantern-buoys and light-ships are few and far between this far North. Being within sight of land...any land...seems to relax the tension that has been building on the ship. We cross over another abyss and I take care to keep my eyes on the horizon. You learn quickly not to look into such depths. Sometimes...the abyss stares back.\n\nI've supplemented our now meager rations with Zee-Bat jerky. Somewhere between the tomb-colonies and the Whither, we lost another crewmember. It's a shape-shifter, of that much I'm sure. It is among my crew, but all I have are baseless accusations. I can't afford to lose anyone else if I want to maintain our cruising speed. The less time we spend steaming in the dark the better. So all I can allow myself to hope is that the murderer continues to pull its weight.\n\nI dreamt of a wind in the depths, carrying something up. I fear I've spent too much time here. London used to call me home after a long voyage; a beer in a noisy pub, a smile from my love, all helped me forget the terror. Too I felt the lure of the zee, promising fortune with the lunatic sigh of the waves breaking on the shore. The dread now calls me too. That pull of the other at the bottom. Too many nightmares.

I've been through a few Captains. Each had a story of their own, each journey touched me and each I will remember. My first died at my own fault: I explored too far, took too many risks and they limped back to Fallen London with hardly any hope of success; no fuel, no supplies, no money; it was over and the Captain and crew were forced to abandon their dreams there in the port of London. Others I lost to battles too ambitious; slain by giant Angler Megalops, or Unfinished Pirates, or Mutiny at the hands of their own crew. Surviving a Mutiny is as terrifying as failing, which I succeeded in once; that Captain was ruthless and cold, and I truly felt the zee punished him as moments after the bloody Mutiny he was ambushed and slain by pirates.\n\nOne Captain, in particular, will go down in zee-stories for years to come. I named him William Meriwether. In the deep darkness of the zee there are many horrors and each trip needs to be planned out carefully. Captain Meriwether found profitable shipments in selling wine and honey, swapping stories with other zailors and getting lucky with the Gods of the zee. I felt such accomplishment when I managed to secure him some lodgings and a Will. From that point onwards the game changed. It was no longer about that one Captain's story; it was about the legacy that he could leave.\n\nWhen I was given the option to Retire it changed how I played. Do I let the Captain retire comfortably now? Or do I risk it and keep exploring? Do I get as much money as I can to secure a better future? The longer you're in the zee the higher the Terror, the higher the risk. Journeys become further wrought with fear, the light becomes your only comfort, ports become untrustworthy and each trip has to pay off. London becomes a shining safe-haven, you let out a sigh of utter relief when you reach home. I did have a moment where I resolved to do one last trip with this Captain and let him have his peaceful retirement; but on that last trip something significantly changed in the story which led me to discover more, explore further, enquire deeper and he instead fell to the zee.\n\nWhat makes "Sunless Sea" so beautifully clever is that you decide it all. You decide how you win, you decide how you make money, you decide which jobs to follow, you decide which monsters to fight.\nThe whole game is paced incredibly well, it gives you time to think about your actions every step of the way. Everything has a circumstance. The combat system highlights this well, as with each fight you queue up your options and you have chance to pause at any time and change those options. You can then choose what you want to do after the fight; will you butcher the creature, or study it?\n\nI'm extremely excited about new updates, and I will say that this game is worth every penny in its current state.\n\nThere are so many stories left to weave on the deep dark zee.\n\n","July 9, 2014","true","26.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Permadeath is optional (and no shame in turning it off at all), first of all.  The randomization is minimal.  With full knowledge of the game, you should basically never die.  Ever.  The main draw of the game of learning about it.  Once you have, it loses much of its luster.  But it will take 30 plus hours, at the least, to get a good grasp of everything going on in the unterzee.  Unfortunately, getting more than one ending will take much longer than this, but at the least there are some branching quest lines that will keep going.  And even if you only achieve one objective...this game is still w focal point of the game is the story.  #2 is managing your resources to explore the unterzee.  #3 (and frankly a distant third) would be economic trading/combat.\n\nPros:\n\n- Best writing I've read in a game since planescape torment.\n- Excellent music\n- Ridiculously oppressive atmosphere\n- Exploration is a good mix of enlightening and frightening\n- Rewarding to learn about the world you are thrust in.

Grinding is absolutely the worst way to play this game.  It is the opposite and perfect antidote for games where you need to optimize your numbers to succeed.  There is something for you no matter what your stats are.  That said, the game doesn't really start until you've managed to buy a townhouse and make a will.  That will cost you around 1200 coins, and is the only way to gain any permanence.  However, grinding is STILL not the best way to make those 1200 coins.  The best way is to take missions, and let your curiosity guide you.  After that you want to make it a priority to get another 200 coins each generation to make another will.\n\nTwo:  It's lovely.  It's hypnotic.  It invaded my dreams.  I've been trying it over the free weekend.  I played it for about ten hours, and I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface.  I am definitely buying it.\n\nThree:  Parts of it can get a little repetitive, due to the fact that all the islands reset when you die and a start a new captain.  Do I really need to go through the whole guinea pig vs. rat war again?  Why can't it restart at the point where the last captain left it?  Despite that, the previous poster is also correct when he says that if you go back to the same island, there can be different options which can lead to very interesting story indeed.\n\nFour:  There are a few bugs.  For example:  I lost one captain because he had to pick up a delivery for a criminal.  When he got to the place where the delivery was supposed to be, it wasn't there.  So when he finally returned to New London, they knifed him.\n\n8/10","January 31","true","32.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The world is very well fleshed out, every island and nation is unique and interesting, some of them are quite silly, some are rather sinister. There is certainly a Lovecraftian element to it. You make a difference in this world, it's only up to you which path you'll choose. Don't expect to see everything on the first run though, some events must be completed before certain time, so if you want to achieve something very specific, you'll need to plan ahead. I've put some hours into it and it feels like I just scraped the surface, I have yet to see the surface, or explore the depths of the "zee", because apparently you can get a submarine. This game is completely stuffed with content.\n\nYou can actually win this game, it's not just the exploration, you have goal, an ambition of your choice, that you'll need to fulfill. Choosing who you were before becoming a captain will make a difference too.\n\nThe exploration is slow at first, but that gets better as you gather money and improve your ship. Staying alive can be tricky especially if you over-extend your cruises, because there is so much you need to keep an eye on- your hull, fuel, food and of course- the terror. There is a permadeath by the way, but you can choose a legacy that will be given to your next captain as a starting bonus. The gameplay is for the most part quite slow as result of the rich storytelling, BUT it can get pretty intense when your terror reaches certain height, I've experienced terror over 90 and survived and I can tell you this- you'll start losing crew pretty quickly. This game understands pacing and atmosphere, which is underlined by an excellent soundtrack.\n\nAnother strenght is the solid graphics style, every part of the "zee" is different, the sea of lilies or sea of coral in particular are sight to behold. The attention to detail is marvelous. There is even an island of spiders. There is quite a lot of teal color everywhere, but that's okay with me, you can always use more teal.\n\nThere is but one weakness, the combat system. You cannot fire at will, your guns have a quite weird cooldown, where you have to basically have the oponent in sights, lose a line of sight (turn away from it for instance) and the cooldown will stop. It's not the best explanation, but this really needs to be experienced to fully understand it. I have a piece of advice for you- don't try to fight everything you see, you'll burn through your fuel and supplies and don't get anywhere. But for the most part you can completely avoid it.\n\nSo, if you like narratively driven games and Lovecraft, you'll love this one.","January 31","true","90.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

If you can get passed those 2 problems then you'll love this natical based, survival game, RPG. As im posting this im still attempting to beat this game for the first time, I'm currently in a campaign that is looking real good to get to that end. But...

I also suggest you DO NOT look up things on the wiki, after about 5 deaths (one being ridiculous) i googled some stuff, and realized just how scripted or random things are.... which kills it (it being the mysteriousness of the game) a little bit,... but I'm playing this game more for the survival challenge than the DND RPG dice rolls.\n\nAnyway, As i said, i do recommend this game if its on sale.

It's one that begs to be explored, and is the primary impetus of the game. Unfortunately, you can only do so very slowly, and if you die, you're going to start almost from nothing. You need a lot of money to explore the world, but the game right out says that the most obvious method of making money (running goods to ports) isn't profitable. You instead need to sell information, or ship unusual cargo, things that can only be found by exploring.\nThe story is the game's primary draw. Deep and dark, there's a fantastic amount of material. I almost feel it would be better told as an old school text based RPG (with art, this game's art is amazing). Do away with the resource management, and you could really plunge into the game's lore; this could very easily have been a game the people obsess over. But 75% of the game is money running, which is a realy tragedy.\nThat all said, do buy the game if you like a good story. One upside of the slow pace: it's a very peaceful game. Don't have many of those in my library, and it's nice to play something quiet every once in a while.","February 2","true","15.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It reminded me of "Sid Meir's Pirates" in concept (overhead naval-based adventure) but had a dark theme and much more fleshed out story.\n\nIt is unforgiving. You'll play for days as a character and slip up somewhere which leaves you perminently dead and several days of lost progress. having to redo every single quest and work your way from barely more than nothing. Even having to re-explore the map because the islands have rearranged themselves - which wouldn't be an issue but exploring is dangerous when you have limited fuel. My first captain lost his fuel and required a lift back to london. It was fairly impossible to come back form that since you lose your ship and all money and are given a literal floating bathtub with too little of a hold to even contain the fuel to go out - much less raid ships or play merchant.\n\nThat's not even counting the more dangerous and interesting threats in the game. Just about everything in the game that moves wants to kill you. And no matter how fast you are they're faster. No matter how hard you hit they hit harder. And most of all: death is final for you.\n\nWhen you run low on crew the game feels as though it can physically grab time itself and crush it like tin foil. The game will suck your very soul out through your impatience with the time the voyage takes. To put this into perspective this is a game that will require you to survive and play for days to complete even if you can move at full steam the whole time. Cut the speed in half and you're dying inside to just make it to some town that you can gather crew from. I even invested in the second-best engines I could find in London and I swear despite the heavy cost I saw no difference at all compared to the starting engines.\n\nIf I'm honest I'm not sure if I recommend playing this game or recommend avoiding this game. It's addictive which works both ways. the steepness of the game feels like a gimmick to trick you into playing over and over - I've never even managed to reach a point where I could upgrade my ship yet (I've upgraded guns and engines, but not actual ships).\n\nI'd give this game a 4/10. It's not a bad game and I'll probably play more of it. but it's a game that drags on. It's more addictive than it is fun. If I could I'd leave this game a nuetral review.

I have spent many hours playing and plan to spend even more. So here we go.\n\nPro's:\n\n+The Music: Although this may not seem like an important factor, it has a big play when it comes to dark games as they need to matain balance between fright and curiousity without getting old or annoying.\n\n+The Lore: This is definately the games strongest point. I loved reading every bit of text when I entered a port. It is well written and pulls you into the game. There are many times when you will happen to go through a process that will have text you have already read (entering a port, talking to a contact, etc.) but I was suprised to notice that this didn't cause me to be bored as new text would show up enough or the rest of the game was entertaining enough to keep me satisfied till the next bit of text showed up.\n\n+The Gameplay: This may seem vague but I assure you I don't mean it to be. The game has a nice balance between planning your next run of ports, steering your vessel, maintaining your crew and sanity, decision making, and the overall power struggles within the game. There is hardly a dull moment.\n\nCon's:\n\n-The Difficulty: This once again sounds vague but it's because it encompasses a few parts. I, personally, like the difficulty but I put this under Con's because it may drive some away from the game. The game naturally has a perma-death feature in place which makes it feel very unforgiving. I see this as a learning experience as well as adding the feeling of vulnerability. If you don't like that, though, you can switch to manual saving in which you can load your game back before you died. Other than that it seems very difficult to prosper. It feels as if there is no real way to make money because you can only make 5-6 profit on an item if you buy it at one port and go all the way back to london and sell it and your supplies cost 30 a pop and don't last very long. I will admit I didn't like this at first, but from what I can tell buying and selling isn't necessarily the intending way of making money, at least not at the beggining. The slow progression of prosper causes you to go around the map plenty of times which sinks you deeper into the game and I feel the progress is finely tuned and perfect. Understand though, that is my opinion and others have theirs.\n\nWell I definately think this game is worth the money. I waiting a long time till is was on sale and honestly I wish I would have bought it sooner. I didn't expect much out of the game and it blew me out of the water... so to speak.","July 26, 2015","true","75.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

And it's amazing to those that don't mind text-heavy games, because the writing is actually great! Compare this game to those 'choose your own adventure' books that we all read as kids and you have yourself a real treat.

Permadeath is optional (and no shame in turning it off at all), first of all.  The randomization is minimal.  With full knowledge of the game, you should basically never die.  Ever.  The main draw of the game of learning about it.  Once you have, it loses much of its luster.  But it will take 30 plus hours, at the least, to get a good grasp of everything going on in the unterzee.  Unfortunately, getting more than one ending will take much longer than this, but at the least there are some branching quest lines that will keep going.  And even if you only achieve one objective...this game is still w focal point of the game is the story.  #2 is managing your resources to explore the unterzee.  #3 (and frankly a distant third) would be economic trading/combat.\n\nPros:\n\n- Best writing I've read in a game since planescape torment.\n- Excellent music\n- Ridiculously oppressive atmosphere\n- Exploration is a good mix of enlightening and frightening\n- Rewarding to learn about the world you are thrust in.  Knowledge is greatly rewarded.\n\nCons:\n\n- Combat is extremely simple and straightforward.\n- Slow as hell.\n- End game becomes a grind without the main draw of story driving the game\n- Future captains involve repetition of known elements of the game.  Not a problem for the first couple, but is another long term con.

Grinding is absolutely the worst way to play this game.  It is the opposite and perfect antidote for games where you need to optimize your numbers to succeed.  There is something for you no matter what your stats are.  That said, the game doesn't really start until you've managed to buy a townhouse and make a will.  That will cost you around 1200 coins, and is the only way to gain any permanence.  However, grinding is STILL not the best way to make those 1200 coins.  The best way is to take missions, and let your curiosity guide you.  After that you want to make it a priority to get another 200 coins each generation to make another will.\n\nTwo:  It's lovely.  It's hypnotic.  It invaded my dreams.  I've been trying it over the free weekend.  I played it for about ten hours, and I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface.  I am definitely buying it.\n\nThree:  Parts of it can get a little repetitive, due to the fact that all the islands reset when you die and a start a new captain.  Do I really need to go through the whole guinea pig vs. rat war again?  Why can't it restart at the point where the last captain left it?  Despite that, the previous poster is also correct when he says that if you go back to the same island, there can be different options which can lead to very interesting story indeed.\n\nFour:  There are a few bugs.  For example:  I lost one captain because he had to pick up a delivery for a criminal.  When he got to the place where the delivery was supposed to be, it wasn't there.  So when he finally returned to New London, they knifed him.\n\n8/10","January 31","true","32.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's very much story driven but trade and exploration is the real goal. There are a few downsides so bear these in mind before you try Sunless Sea:\n\n* The interface is super clumsy and not user friendly. You will need a few hours before you learn what is what and you will need to take notes for most stuff (or rely on wiki, which dims the fun).\n* Luck plays a very big part especially if you insist on playing without saves.\n* Combat is not well designed, not to mention it's not important in the game. You need to avoid enemies almost always.\n\nHowever there's one big upside and it makes your time worthy - the game offers a lot to explore and it's being updated by the devs on a regular basis.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/heartstring/recommended/304650/","heartstring","four guys hatoful surprise","http://steamcommunity.com/id/heartstring/","138 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nSo, I'll talk about the three parts of this game: The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige.\n\nFirst, The Pledge.  This game offers something fairly normal: it's a top-down RPG in an old vein, but in a fairly novel setting.  It is set slightly higher than the camera in Sid Meyer's Pirates!, and the boat's a steamer instead of a masted boat.  Combat is engaged in the same way, through touching boats/sharks/living mountains.  Combat is done like it is in a text-based game, albeit with a nice graphic user interface: you select options, they "warm up" (opposite of cooling down), and then activate.  Your options are to close the distance, illuminate your opponent, flee, or attack.  All in all, if you're familiar with any of the game's claimed influences then you will recognize them here.  You will also see a ton of influence from text-based adventures in the game if you're familiar with them.  The Ship's Log is a nice homage to text-based adventures.\n\nNext, The Turn.  What makes this game special isn't any component in particular, but the way it puts them together.  It builds upon our modern fascinations with Cthonian horror, Steampunk mystique, and adventuristic RPGs.  The world itself is beautiful and broad.  Each area of the game has a distinct flavour to it, and this makes the Underzee beautiful.  I consider this an amazing feat in a game set in a single-tone setting (that is to say under ground).  It's still novel to see bubbling hills, subterranean volcanos, the corpse of a fallen god, and a city-sized fungus.  Everything from watching my little boat steam along to the appearance of a living mountain is beautifully rendered.  Some of the portraits are of a professional quality that leaves a bit to be desired, but I can still appreciate the quantity of work in the time periods required for publication.  Some of them are genuinely inspired, such as the engineer whose eyes are ready to hatch some unknown horrors.\n\nThe Prestige... Everything is put together very well.  I consider myself to be privileged to offer input on a game like this.  It's very fun, life after life.  The complete package itself is worth playing if you can wait for the final product.  Checking their progress via their update page on their progress page is comforting.  Their concept seems unique; your traits are encompassed in Pages, Mirrors, Veils, Iron, and Hearts, which is adequate and tasteful.\n\nPersonally, I would prefer combat in the style of Side Meyer's Pirates! and a complete, suspenseful darkness in the wilds that made things a little more terrifying.  It would also be nice if there was a different starting port each time you played, and I really look forward to more options to start out with.  I think the part I most look forward to is the creation of some sort of merchant system so that money is a bit more obtainable.  Right now the profit margins on the goods you can trade don't even pay for the supplies you expend bringing them to port.  The continuity system is somewhat disappointing that the "Iron-Clad Will" is so out of reach.  One prominent review has pointed out how hard it is to make money right now, and that's true.\n\nAs a final note, the terror mechanism will probably be the most frustrating (to both players and developers).  At the moment terror is simply either too quickly gained or too difficult to lose; it needs to swing one way or another, or maybe add a higher upper limit on it so that a person can fall farther into the depths of madness.\n\nAs it is, it's a relaxing cruise into madness, and the continuity system is most satisfying.  Probably the best memory I have of the game was when Citizen Exile, one of my captains, made his last stand (out of fuel and food) against Mt. Nomad.  He left his mark on the Cthonian Horror and inspired the next captain to sail forth with a hope for future, a heart of gold, and secrets in his pages.\n\ntl;dr:\n\n-Merchant system is in development, not currently workable\n-Terror system can be frustrating\n-Early game is repetitive\n\n+Good homage to everything it claims (text-based games, Lovecraft, Steampunk, pirates)\n+Excellent setting and art; unique in my opinion\n+Good price right now for AMAZING potential final game\n+Your money goes toward the developers' shoes","July 6, 2014","true","32.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I have spent many hours playing and plan to spend even more. So here we go.\n\nPro's:\n\n+The Music: Although this may not seem like an important factor, it has a big play when it comes to dark games as they need to matain balance between fright and curiousity without getting old or annoying.\n\n+The Lore: This is definately the games strongest point. I loved reading every bit of text when I entered a port. It is well written and pulls you into the game. There are many times when you will happen to go through a process that will have text you have already read (entering a port, talking to a contact, etc.) but I was suprised to notice that this didn't cause me to be bored as new text would show up enough or the rest of the game was entertaining enough to keep me satisfied till the next bit of text showed up.\n\n+The Gameplay: This may seem vague but I assure you I don't mean it to be. The game has a nice balance between planning your next run of ports, steering your vessel, maintaining your crew and sanity, decision making, and the overall power struggles within the game. There is hardly a dull moment.\n\nCon's:\n\n-The Difficulty: This once again sounds vague but it's because it encompasses a few parts. I, personally, like the difficulty but I put this under Con's because it may drive some away from the game. The game naturally has a perma-death feature in place which makes it feel very unforgiving. I see this as a learning experience as well as adding the feeling of vulnerability. If you don't like that, though, you can switch to manual saving in which you can load your game back before you died. Other than that it seems very difficult to prosper. It feels as if there is no real way to make money because you can only make 5-6 profit on an item if you buy it at one port and go all the way back to london and sell it and your supplies cost 30 a pop and don't last very long. I will admit I didn't like this at first, but from what I can tell buying and selling isn't necessarily the intending way of making money, at least not at the beggining. The slow progression of prosper causes you to go around the map plenty of times which sinks you deeper into the game and I feel the progress is finely tuned and perfect. Understand though, that is my opinion and others have theirs.\n\nWell I definately think this game is worth the money. I waiting a long time till is was on sale and honestly I wish I would have bought it sooner. I didn't expect much out of the game and it blew me out of the water... so to speak.","July 26, 2015","true","75.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall the game has an amazing world, very rich lore you could play for months and still learn a little something new, perfect atmosphere and great mechanics. However this game suffers from the horrible curse of being so hard to play its not so much fun but more of a challenge.\n\nGood aspects:\n-As I said the world is incredibly well thought out and populated with so many things\n-The mechanics while not completely new are very tailored to this game and fit well\n-Characters feel real and not: Hello I am the Tutorial quest\n-The map and quests/events often change so you wont always get the same results\n\nNow comes the other side of the game the negative. I dont mind a challenging game, FTL is challenging but just fair enough to keep you coming back for more. This game expects you to die and die often. More often than not 2 things will happen. 1. Run out of fuel and then the trouble starts usually leading to the end of the game. 2. the food runs out which leads to the end of the game. This game really had such marvolous potential but the fact of the matter is you only have so much space for fuel and food (not counting cargo if you want to make a profit) and if your a person who likes to explore and investigate a world vs just going from quest to quest you wont get much of a chance here.\n\nBad aspects:\n-you only have so much space for fuel and food so you have to make choices\n- it is REALLY hard to make money in this game\n-when you die all your progress in the game resets (maps, money, treasure)\n-the distance between islands is very long so exploring unknown places means you wont last long in a small boat\n-the game promises to be lovecraftian and filled with horrors, but they arnt easy to find and not nearly as exciting or rewarding as you would think\n-combat sucks unless you have very exspensive equipment\n-unless you have acomplished very hard to do quests, you dont get to keep hardly anything from your last game\n-the game punishes curiosity more than it rewards it\n\nSo here is my advice, if you want a game that takes hours to play, has tons of content and a facinating world this is a great game to buy. However if you want to have FUN or explore it, download Cheat Engine to solve the money problems. It does make the game more enjoyable.","June 29, 2015","true","15.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is not fast paced, it is aimed at people who want to enjoy the exploration of it's giant map, the people that want to read for the majority of their time in game.\n\nFor this reason, Sunless Sea is inevitably love or hate. If you enjoy reading AND difficult resource management and route planning, you will love this game. These are not always things that go together however, so it is definitely not for everyone.\n\nPersonally I love this game. I enjoy the long treks into the sea, I enjoy writing down which items I need, and keeping track of where I can get them. I enjoy running the same trade routes to get the money I need for upgrades and quests. It is an excellent game, with very few flaws.\n\nOutside of the game being very niche, the only other flaws are minor UI bugs; the objectives tab is pretty useless so expect to write things down in order to remember them, many other values are pretty unclear and there is sometimes clipping in item discription when reading rewards/costs of actions.\n\nAll in all, this is a great game for the kind of people it was made for, and will not be for everyone. If you're okay with dying to explore, learning from your mistakes, and taking in a vaste new world; I recommend you buy this game. You will easily get 100 hours of gameplay out of this if you learn the basics, and if you love it you will get even more.","June 28, 2015","true","39.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Got cursed by a sea god, and found my wife and child dead upon returning to port. Jeez, high stakes here. Chased by a living iceberg, fled to a narrow fjord that the iceberg couldn't enter, and spent days chipping away at it with the deck gun until it finally keeled over. Spent dozens of hours on an epic quest to discover my father's bones, long lost at sea, only to discover he wasn't fully human! Fought an ill-considered battle against some behemoth of the deep, which wrecked my boat and killed most of my crew. The journey back to London was a nail-biting epic - fleeing from other mosters at reduced speed, creeping around in the dark, desperately charting course for a temporary haven to buy more fuel and supplies... when I finally made it it felt like a real accomplishment.\n\nThe narratives and atmospherics of this game are just amazing. I am lost to sunless sea...\n\nwhich is not to say it can't be improved! Some of the story lines seem to peter out early, without a satisfying end to what had been a tantalizing opening. Sea combat can feel a bit routine after a while. And the world could be a bit more dynamic, in terms of things changing in reponse to the player's actions. A better interface for making notes and tracking missions would be good - as it stands now, I have to keep a pad of paper next to me to jot things down, remember what's where, and what I was up to last time I played. And a broader selection of useful boats would be nice, together with maybe a warehouse in town.\n\nBut these are all minor concerns.

It really does take a while to get started and the pace really is slow so I understand that some people might be turned off by it. But I stuck with it and allowed myself to get immeresed in all the little stories you start weaving together once you start exploring more and now I can't stop playing.\n\nI'm also not a fan of Rogue-like games in general but since this is more Rogue-lite I find it more forgiving that other games like FTL. I feel like the rogue-like aspect of the game is just enough to keep the tension up during your long travels but not so hard that it feels frustrating. Plus, as long as you live long enough to have a will, it also ensures that you'll be better equipped when you start a new game.\n\nAll in all it's a nice little game that I play if I want something atmospheric and not too intense too play.","May 27","true","66.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

But as someone who really enjoys writing and good storytelling, along with the whole Victorian-era steampunk aesthetic, Sunless Sea quickly became one of my favorite games. At first, the writing might be a little overwhelming to those more accustomed to faster-paced roguelike/survival games, but it's the writing and quests you find yourself immersed in that keep you coming back for more. While the game thrives as an interactive story told over the lifetimes of numerous captains you create and play as (with more chapters and content added post-release regularly for free), it's still decently fun when it comes to combat and exploration. Albeit, your safer bet is on the latter if you intend on making money and surviving early on, but there's nothing wrong with wanting to hunt some of the more dreadful monsters lurking in the deeps.\n\nBe careful though: much like the dastardly Zeebeasties, you'll soon find yourself swallowed up by this game.\n\nSee what I did there?

The writing has all the strange flair of Fallen London, which is both this game's and FL's greatest strength. But I'm the kind of person who dies all the darn time even in regular games that don't assure you right off the bat, like Sunless Sea does, that "dying is normal and part of the game, it's okay", so you can bet I died a whole bunch of times here.\n\nDying is okay, but it can also get frustrating. I don't mind the failure--I mind the repetitive part of the beginning-game, where you have to revisit the same islands in basically the same order, travel the same paths, and read many of the same (admittedly wonderful) text snippets (even if the stories do change sometimes).\n\nPermadeath works better when the world is truly randomized on each new life. Permadeath games should also make you go "DAMN IT. All right, one more round and I'll definitely get it this time..." Unfortunately, I didn't really get that sense here.\n\nDespite all that, Sunless Sea is a beautiful-looking game filled with cool writing. If you're patient and clever, maybe you'll die less often than me and enjoy it more.\n\nP.S. I HIGHLY recommend Fallen London.\n\nRating: 2/55: Loved it; 4: Liked it; 3: It's OK; 2: Didn't like it; 1: Hated it","January 29","false","0.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sunless Sea is a roguelikelike where you play as a captain on the underground sea - or "zea", as the game insists on spelling it.\n\nThe game's in early access currently, and I'd been aware of it for a little while but put off by the price tag. Ultimately, a preview video by Stuff+ convinced me to give it a try.\n\nIn the game, you steer your ship between islands in the sunless sea. You are trying to become wealthy, or gather stories and artefacts to improve your abilities and advance the game's plot. Resources are scarce: you need fuel for your ship and supplies for your crew. And every second out on the open ocean increases the terror meter as you and your crew slowly go mad from fear.\n\nThis means you die quite a lot: eaten by monsters, cast adrift by a lack of fuel, killed by mutineers. When that happens, you can retain some things for your next game - more if you got around to making a will.\n\nOn the islands, you can pursue various stories, which have frequent checks against your (somewhat esoterically named) skills. There's a lot of writing here, which is unsurprising given that this game is an offshoot from the storytelling game Fallen London[fallenlondon.storynexus.com]. Apart from the stories, there is trade, exploration and some (fairly simple) combat.\n\nVerdictSo is it any good? It's quite fun, it's beautiful, the setting is good, the mechanics are solid. My main gripe is that your ship moves very slowly, combat is repetitive, and opportunities for earning cash are thin on the ground, so you spend a lot of time just steering your ships and doing trivial fights on autopilot. One can hope that this can be ameliorated somewhat by the final version, but I worry that this kind of grindy gameplay is intentional.","August 2, 2014","true","157.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Every snippet or rumor you learn as you explore lets you decide how the world and its inhabitants have come to be.

The synopsis of the game is very accurate.  It's a bit heavy on resource management and there is quite a bit of pointless grinding, but it's really fun.  Exploring the sea is challenging, there are always these new shocks and surprises and the game keeps you on your toes.\n\nBut it's a broken game.  It's broken in that the death of your character can occur in random encounters.  You can build up a captain with 30 hours of sailing in between ports, have a nice powerful ship, and then- bam- random street encounter, he's dead, and all that progress is lost.  There's no way to judge the lethality of encounters, especially encounters in ports, before making a decision.  Hence, death and the loss of the character has this whimsical aspect to it.  It's like getting insta-killed by a monster you can't see.  So, a broken game.  I think the designers wanted something with the lethality of "Dark Souls," maybe.  Who knows?  They screwed up.\n\nTo play the game successfully, like with "Dark Souls," requires manipulating the game mechanics themselves.  Specifically, figuring out when the game auto-saves and using that to your advantage.  If you die at sea, alt-f4 the game, closing it, opening it again, and then reload the last autosave.\n\nIt's cheesy.  It's cheap.  It's borderline cheating, but that's how to fix the design flaws.  Once that's done, it's really fun.  So, a B+ game.  Good, but flawed.  With fixable flaws.","June 28, 2015","true","59.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It offers permadeath and is not a roguelike. You start by gathering some supplies for a ship and then sail into the black unknown, map uncharted. The map’s cut into zones that points of interest (PoIs) can randomly spawn in, with the exception of the border PoIs being static. In every playthrough, all PoIs will be available, and thereby nearly all stories that the game has to offer. The stories are both the game’s strongest and weakest points.\n\nPositives\n\nStripped entirely of story, the game would be boring: bring something here, revisit this place when, slowly (very) upgrade your ship. Standard fare. It’s the story that you come and stay for, and it kept me playing far longer than I expected to. The writing is almost always of Excellent quality. The story is fairly plausible within Fallen London’s most-anything-can-happen internal logic. I had no trouble being immersed in the atmosphere.\n\nThe graphics are pretty and the character/quality pictures are drawn well. I’ll never forget a certain moment in my first fight against a certain zee (sea) creature.\n\nThe combat is good. I feel like it could be just a little more, but it doesn’t need to be more. I personally enjoyed hunting zee beasts.\n\nIt feels like a roguelike in the regard that a minor miscalculation can ruin your voyage quickly. I remember a long procession of misery that all stemmed from my inclination to fight a bound-shark when I had low fuel, leaving me at the mercy of the gods, who happened to think sending me to a far-away DEATH ISLAND was a great means of salvation. I got so many Steam “achievements” for that one and I barely made it out alive. Was a good time!\n\nCriticism\n\nThe islands are insular and only very rarely (do they even?) will the stories overlap between PoIs. “I need Scintillack, which you can get at this place.” does not count as two islands interacting with each other. In a way this is good because each island is manageable, but it certainly isn’t plausible and a more dynamic Sunless Sea would have been appreciated. For example, in the case of the Isle of Cats, I took a shipment from a Cat-Woman to London. I then screwed her over by selling it for double. I then returned, beat her up, and made a similar deal with a tiger who I proceeded to do the same thing to, but I never returned. That was early on and I didn’t heard a peep of it for the rest of the game.\n\nThe stories are great -- the first time. On the second playthrough, you can make different choices, but it’s still the same base story you’re playing. This diminishes replay value when the game’s drawing feature is how great the stories are. The saving grace is that I still had a few PoIs to really dig into, and the reality is the stories will less fresh when I play again in two years.\n\nUpgrading your house and to a smaller extent, your boat, are hardly upgrades. You essentially upgrade your house to pay more to sleep in it. With boats, they get heavier and thereby slower, with the first major upgrade only offering a Forward slot for all that trouble. It comes with higher crew requirements and it’s slower, so you’re paying more than just the 3,000 echoes after the fact. Where boats should expand the gameplay or offer an alternative, you really only have access to a merchant-vessel for making (poorly defensible) big trips carrying loads of cargo, but it’s still ponderous and you can only have one ship at a time.\n\nI broke out my mobile phone a little too often during long, boring commutes from island to island. Something should be done when the player hasn’t touched the keyboard for 15+ seconds. Only when I bought the +2,500 engine power engine did it really feel like I was blazing around -- then I upgraded the ship and it got a bit slower, buzzkill. There’s some method of getting a great engine and then going at Full Power, but I never tried it and it’d be noisy as Hell anyway.\n\nFinally, the Supremacy mechanic could be much more fun than it really is. I made London Supreme, so where are our navy boats floating around the zee? Why did the Khan seem to give absolutely no care about it?\n\nOVERALL\n\nBuy the game! It’s really fun! Highly recommended. Support developers who write words. They/we’re the future of the richest gaming experiences.","May 30, 2015","true","54.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

The game is pretty hard on you, and has perma-death normally enabled.   (You can turn it off).  There have been times I have done a cargo run, purchased a bunch of stuff, finished a quest and gotten my quest reward, and then only to have lost money after refitting and repairing my ship\n\n10).  This game takes its time.  It's not some quick and fast game.  You move and fight with enough time to get things working and to prevent issues.\n\n\n\nThat's a pretty odd set of stuff for the game.  And it's a fun game.  The flavor for this game is just outstanding.  Sunless Sea has some of the best writing of any game I've ever played period.\n\n\nAnd Flavor?  It's oozing with it from every single tentacle.  From the squid like humanoids to various eldritch additions to your crew, and yourself, it's good.  In various ports you have people, quests, exploring, allies, enemies, and more.  From stores to upgrade your ship or to purchase new ones, to buying and picking up some stuff for your crew and officers, there's a lot to do.  Make sure to keep your terror levels as low as possible too, by the by...\n\n\nGet ready for a creepy, fun, slow-paced, game that really pushes Roguelike games to the next level in my mind.","January 22","true","48.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

They originally did this in a web game called "Echo Bazaar" (later renamed "Fallen London"), which had a wonderful setting and stories but was crippled by an expensive time currency.\n\nIn Sunless Sea they've ported this setting and storytelling to a "pay once" game, but unfortunately they've replaced the time currency with some equally problematic and distracting mechanics. Whereas Fallen London's storytelling was undermined by having to wait (or pay way too much) for the time currency, Sunless Sea's storytelling is undermined by spending even more time slogging back and forth across empty oceans at a glacial pace, desperately trying to scrape together enough money from a broken trade system that you can afford the next expensive thing you need to advance the story. In 90% of cases, that "expensive thing you need to advance the story" is just enough basic supplies and fuel to reach the next plot checkpoint.\n\nSometimes you fight bad guys in a brainless combat system that involves going toe-to-toe with them until one of you dies, but the rewards for combat are typically much lower than the unavoidable repairs for the combat will cost you.\n\nSo what could be done to fix it? The core problem is pacing, and there are two things that could be done to improve this: fast travel, and the economy.\n\nIf I had the option of "Fast travelling from Port A to Port B is a chancy use of your whatever quality", instead of spending a half hour slogging across an empty ocean I'd slogged across a hundred times before, that would be a big improvement.\n\nI would also suggest fixing the economy so that the player isn't spending the majority of his time trying not to go bankrupt, and could spend more time focusing on the stories.\n\nIf your game's primary goal is storytelling, but there's so much slog between story snippets that your players forget the stories, and if they see the same text so often that they stop reading, then you're not doing yourself any favors.\n\nThis game is very highly-rated in general, so obviously these aspects don't bother other players as much as they bother me, but I think these additions could give the game broader appeal, and also improve the game for those who already love it.","January 31","false","17.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

Every snippet or rumor you learn as you explore lets you decide how the world and its inhabitants have come to be.

Until it does. The game is set in across an underground ocean, where current and tides shift the islands and landmasses around every once in a while. You're the captain of ship amongst many others, in a world of Lovecraftian piracy where smuggled sunlight and spirit-infused honey are contraband goods.\n\nIt's not a game for the wilfully illiterate. If you are annoyed by reading paragraphs upon paragraphs of texts on the sidebars, Sunless Sea probably isn't for you. After all, the game derived from a browser-based game called Fallen Londoni consisting of large swathes of text to go through.\n\nAs you create your character, you also designate your aspiration, which may be retiring rich or perhaps making a great discovery. You're then set with a rickety ship at the Wolfstack Docks in Fallen London. Through trading, piracy and other quests, you're going to make money, improve your ship and recruit a crew.\n\nSunless Sea mainly features a bird's eye view of Unterzee, the abovementioned underground ocean. You navigate these waters and find your way around by deploying a Zeebat, which scans a large circle around your ship, allowing you to explore the map. For what is essentially an animated map, Sunless Sea looks spectacular. The artworks in some of the islands are simply things of sheer beauty to look. Many islands feature some sort of trading post, which you should manipulate, so to speak, and buy cheap to sell dear. When you learn how to manage your fuel and supplies, and remember the price rates in varipus ports, making decent amounts of money becomes manageable.\n\nDuring your voyages, you're accompanied by a crew. These are divided into "named" characters and anonymous crew. Anonymous crew consists of the "brute" force of your ship and they determine the efficiency of your speed and maneuverability. In other words, fewer crew members, the slower you'll sail and turn. Then, there are the named NPCs, which you can recruit and assign to posts such as Chief Engineer, Chef and so on. These characters come with certain benefits and improvements to your ship, not to mention their specific quests and backstories. These quests sometimes lead to further improvement of their traits, which makes them worth following through.\n\nWhile out there in the Unterzee, your Insanity meter will crawl up. Darkness is a major factor in this - if you stray from the buoys dispersed across the Unterzee, the darkness will slowly madden you and your crew. This leads to nightmares, which may exacerbate the situation, and at really high levels, you may end with a mutinee. Of course, these lamp-mounted buoys are not particularly linear in their positions - straight sailing from one to the other will deplete your fuel unduly, while ignoring them altogether will cause undue Insanity. This is one of many micro-management deals in the game.\n\nThe soundtrack of the game is often pleasant and sometimes particularly beautiful. As it doesn't loop often, the sudden introduction of the background music adds to the eerieness and tension, whereas returning to the Wolfstack Docks will almost always be matched with one of the more warmer tracks to emphasise that homecoming feeling.\n\nSunless Sea nevertheless skirts around the niche category. Its long texts, necessary for the its intricate stories, do not speak to all players, neither does the micromanagement of scarce maritime resources promise joy to everybody. Yet, for those who do enjoy such features, as well as those who have liking of Lovecraftian themes, Sunless Sea is a satisfactory title.","November 11, 2015","true","63.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There's a reason I call it Funless Sea.\n\nThe good part is that the developers have crafted a weird, wonderful world populated with interesting stories and artwork. The mood is great. The world is interesting. The stories are kind of cool and occasionally not just a little messed up in the head. The world is the same close to your base but in every game it gets more and more randomized the further you get. That's a wonderful gameplay idea and I give serious props to the devs for creating such a great universe.\n\nUnfortunately, they didn't know what to do with it. People will talk about the decent writing, the dark mood, the truly unique world that was created when they praise this game. What they don't talk about is the gameplay and that's where this falls flat. There is no direction and there are really no aims in this game. You get in a ship and go...wherever. It doesn't really seem to matter. You'll find a rare workable trade route and do nothing but grind it as long as you can because money is hard to come by. You'll visit the same ports over and over getting nothing but port reports for a few echos (dollars) at a time when it takes tens of thousands to get a new ship. The pace of the ship is ponderous (and that's being kind). So underneath this interesting world the game devolves into a slow, dull grind. It's really a shame because even mediocre gameplay mechanics could have gone a long way here.\n\nYes, the pace is supposed to reflect the tension of your slowly deteriorating crew. To some respect it does that. But more often than not my head just wants to hit the keyboard from playing this. My time is more valauble than that. Most of the people I've talked to that have "enjoyed" the game used cheats to boost their gold to get somewhere in this bore-fest. I love good exploration games, but this feels aimless and pointless to me.\n\nNot that I haven't give it a chance. I tried buying it and then returned it under the Steam policy.

The variety in the stories spread across the islands is captivating. Playing Sunless Sea is not dissimilar to getting hooked on a really good book, with the addition of atmospheric music that matches the mood and feel of the game perfectly. Add to this the agonising decision making and the continuous, tempting gambles the game seduces you into (and probably requires) to make progress, and you begin to understand the call of Zee.\n\nIs it a bit grinding? In all honesty, yes, it takes a while to re-reach the same place in the/a story after the death of a Captain. That said, the game would lose a lot of the trepidation that makes it so enthralling if the permadeath had no consequences.\n\nOn a more personal note I am a HUGE fan of the Victorian Gothic styling of the game universe. I don't think this game could have worked as well in any other setting.\n\nOnce again, the writing is brilliant. It captures the essence of weird horror perfectly. It makes the game unique, eerie and powerful. It drew me in more than pretty much any other game ever has.

However I will not purchase the game, because of the lack of humour. The dark setting is really melancholic and after playing for sometime it really starts to get to you. I personally really like the atmosphere, but the lack of humour and light hearted moments really start to eat away the expereince for me. I feel like if they would have added some more interesting characters and humour it would have helped to break the very dark atmosphere in the game at somepoints and provided the game with more balance to make the dark moments feel even darker. Now the game just feels like swimming in the sea of depression with no end. The more I played the less I cared what happens to my character as everything in the game is so dark and I ended up sailing reclessly which really took away the impact from the atmoshpere.\n\nIf I would compare this to Metro games, which I love for the same reasons, this would be like Metro, but  all the visits to the stations would be extremely melancholic with almost no light, no hope, no homour and no life. Even though the visits to the sations played a minor part in Metro games they really gave contrast to the dark tunnels and the dead city. They made you feel safe and happy in between the dark gameplay segments. Now that I think of it, I understand that that the visits to the stations and some of the friendly companions you meet on your journey make the darker tunnels feel darker and make you care for Artyom, humans and the gameworld much more and keep you interested and invested in the game until the end.\n\nHowever I will recommend the game as it is very atmospheric, interesting, unique and has great gameplay. If the lack of humour does not bother you or you intend to play it for a short period at a time it is a great interesting game.","January 31","true","6.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

They originally did this in a web game called "Echo Bazaar" (later renamed "Fallen London"), which had a wonderful setting and stories but was crippled by an expensive time currency.\n\nIn Sunless Sea they've ported this setting and storytelling to a "pay once" game, but unfortunately they've replaced the time currency with some equally problematic and distracting mechanics. Whereas Fallen London's storytelling was undermined by having to wait (or pay way too much) for the time currency, Sunless Sea's storytelling is undermined by spending even more time slogging back and forth across empty oceans at a glacial pace, desperately trying to scrape together enough money from a broken trade system that you can afford the next expensive thing you need to advance the story. In 90% of cases, that "expensive thing you need to advance the story" is just enough basic supplies and fuel to reach the next plot checkpoint.\n\nSometimes you fight bad guys in a brainless combat system that involves going toe-to-toe with them until one of you dies, but the rewards for combat are typically much lower than the unavoidable repairs for the combat will cost you.\n\nSo what could be done to fix it? The core problem is pacing, and there are two things that could be done to improve this: fast travel, and the economy.\n\nIf I had the option of "Fast travelling from Port A to Port B is a chancy use of your whatever quality", instead of spending a half hour slogging across an empty ocean I'd slogged across a hundred times before, that would be a big improvement.\n\nI would also suggest fixing the economy so that the player isn't spending the majority of his time trying not to go bankrupt, and could spend more time focusing on the stories.\n\nIf your game's primary goal is storytelling, but there's so much slog between story snippets that your players forget the stories, and if they see the same text so often that they stop reading, then you're not doing yourself any favors.\n\nThis game is very highly-rated in general, so obviously these aspects don't bother other players as much as they bother me, but I think these additions could give the game broader appeal, and also improve the game for those who already love it.","January 31","false","17.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

I dont see it listed as early access but it obviously is. I have run into a lot of issues which effect the ability to even play the game.\n\nAt the start you choose your characters past but you can opt to skip this and do it at a later point. I choose to do it later one time and when it asked me to choose a name and a portait it would never lock in the choice so i had to close the game and reopen, at which point i saved some of the choices i made but ignored the name and portrait. I have found a lot of issues like this with menu stuff just not resetting.\n\nIf you get into combat with 2 things at once you can only kill the first one then the option to even fire the gun gets locked out  and theres no way to reset it ruining combat. this could easily be fixed by allowing us to enter and exit combat mode at will instead of being locked in combat when a foe is in range.\n\ngame pace is too slow, similar to zelda: the wind waker there is a ton of ocean and not much land so the travel times between them is super long. Though I didnt mind it as much in wind waker that game didnt have the fuel and food limitations.\n\nThere are 2 resources in the game fuel and supplies. Supplies can be used to repair the ship problem with this is that the supplies are also your food so you are wasting food by duct taping it to your ship as a repair? how the hell do you repair a ship with food?\n\ncombat is really lame, an option to fish would be nice. I find that when I am low on supplies theres no crabs around for me to kill for food or i run into 2 of them which means i can kill one then have to absorb damage from the other while trying to get out of combat to fix the game glitches.\n\nI have died 4 times and still have no idea how to pass on things I have gained from the game\n\ndespite being a mouse and keyboard game the mouse is only used for clicking icons and text at ports. I dont see why something like holding down left or right click and moving the mouse couldnt let you steer the ship. you move with wasd or arrow keys. not a huge issue but im just used to having mutiple control methods in my games.

If I had bought this game instead of demoing it, I would have been dissappointed but would have persevered but as it stands now the weekend is over, I am glad I don't feel compelled to continue just to get my money's worth.\n\nHaving played Fallen London, I knew the quality of the writing was going to be impressive but although interesting, almost everything is inconsequential. For a story-driven game, there is very little choice in terms of dialog options and with the permadeath mechanic, you have to read exactly the same lines very playthrough.\n\nAll of that would have been fine however if it wasn't for the excruciatingly slow movement of your ship and the terrible UI, which makes following objectives or trying to anticipate what resources are going to inexplicably deplete from a dialog option really frustrating.\n\nIn fact, these were all the same frustrations I had with Fallen London, so maybe it's not for me after all.","January 31","false","5.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It seems to have gone through some redesign cycles and the gameplay still isn't quite there. The story finds ways to surprise you with deleveling somehow based on "conversation" choices that you can make on land... It seems the economy is locked in, which makes it nearly impossible to participate in early on once your hold is full of "quest items," and not able to sustain you as you travel, without expensive new ships. The available ship designs don't really seem like they were thought through - a result of clear winners and clear losers and the time it takes to save up for these items. This applies to weapons as well and the item economy. The game seems to throw a full page of officers out at you and then mysteriously stop, some leaving without warning during other parts of the story. You have combat/utility and shore/utility options if you remember to change the officers before you take actions.\n\nOn the other hand the story itself and the actions you must take to survive enable you to do just that, but this is not a shipping/market/ports game. There is some combat, and you can grind on monsters to supply yourself as you travel, but combat is mostly by convenience, as searching it out will lead to the loss of your resources creating cost to outweigh your savings very quickly.  The simple and few combat mechanics lack excitement and don't seem to evolve. It is definitely frustrating to have to start over from the beginning after you sink well into the game - apparently I completely missed how to engage the inheritance portion of the story in my 12 hours, which allows you to leave more stuff to your heir when you restart.\n\nThe UI's small fonts/reading pages and lack of voice narration ultimately adding to my unwillingness to recommend or buy this game after the free weekend. A game I need to have a film or music on to play, as the in game entertainment is intermittent. This is like a book that I need my granny glasses to read unfortunately, as the hours melt away and I'm still wondering how I'm supposed to make money with all these stores and commodities. Maybe they're meant to be used later on as expense reduction...\n\nIf you're not here for the fantastic WRITING and the strange(ambitious?) multi-tasking survival/resource/grind dynamic and haunting emptiness... pass.","January 31","false","12.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I DO enjoy it. However, I was lead to believe certain things about this game from the trailer and reviews that have turned out to be very different in reality.\n\n1. It's a difficult game, and you will die. A lot.\nI have yet to die once. Every single death-inducing element - terror, fuel, supplies - is easy enough to manage, even when exploring aggressively. Enemy units can be seen far enough away that it's generally simple to avoid engaging them in battle. I see no need to lose my Invictus charm, because there's no need to bother saving.\n\n2. It's a survival horror game.\nI guess this really kind of ties into my first point. There is no horror, and very little survival element (limited to resource management). At absolutely no point have I encountered suspense, because this factor does not exist. There is zero chance that you're going to encounter something entirely unexpected, and so the player has no fear of this happening.\n\nEverything else I'm fine with. I learned from reading others' reviews that the game is slow paced, that earning money to advance is either difficult, or not intuitive. That it becomes tedious to play. That it's very well written, and has excellent story-driven plots. All this I found to be true, and for what the game is, I still enjoy it. Had it been advertised as such, I would recommend it.\n\nHowever, some fairly important claims are made by the developers, claims that they simply do not deliver on.\n\nI'm also disappointed that the game does not display snippets of text on the screen during events like it does in the trailer, because that would lend an extended air of significance and flair to the written element of the game, which in my opinion, is it's strongest point. However, this did not affect my review.","February 1","false","286.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The pacing of the game is slow, and it is a grueling challenge to advance, especially as you start to run out of completable quests.  Some of the fun comes when having to make hard decisions to progress, and in these moments, the gameplay will briefly flicker with excitement before returning to its routine dullness.  Admittingly, the game hinges more on its story elements than gameplay, so to that effect, the gameplay is enough to service the story.\n\nThe style of the game is excellent for an indie title.  Many of the places hidden in the zee are diverse and appropriately Lovecraftian for those seeking that atmosphere.  Music and sound effects help to reinforce the sensation of being adrift in a hostile and alien world.\n\nThe story, however, is the issue I have with this title.  While the game is well written in regards to having an artistic style, the background and lore of this game do not convey well through the writing.  I often found myself reading paragraph after paragraph of dialogue based around histories, cultures and phenomenons I knew nothing about and for which there is little lore in game to explain.  I imagine that's the appeal of the game; the thrill of being thrust head first into an alien world that has little regard for your understanding or lack thereof.  However, without comprehension, there can be no investment, and I eventually found myself skimming the text of the game to get the gist of what's going on.  In a game all about text driven story, this is disasterous.\n\nNot to say it's all painfully obscure.  There are genuine moments in the writing that get you feeling excited for what's about to come, typically nestled within the more grounded moments of the game.  There just are not enough to hold my interest past a free weekend playthrough.\n\nFor those people already immersed in the lore of Fallen London, this title is a must buy, and will likely appeal to players inclined towards Cthulian games.  For those not willing to take the time to learn and understand this world outside the game, I would recommend other titles.  Planescape Torment, the Witcher franchise and Pillars of Eternity, for instance, do a better job of plunging the player into an alien world while fostering investment.  For those attracted to the Lovecraft style, unforgiving decision driven gameplay and the low price point, Darkest Dungeon is an outstanding substitution.","February 1","false","6.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There's virtually no sense of progression even after hours of gameplay. So where's the hook? I don't know. I never found it.\n\nYou really have to get into the atmosphere and writing to keep playing this boring mess, but I found neither could make up for the tedious and repetitious gameplay. The game mechanics that make up 90% of the game are so universally dull that I'm truly shocked at how well this game is regarded.

Every story I read draws me into their world and I feel like I'm there with the captain.\n+Risk/reward gambling. You can go farther out into the Unterzee for more profits/adventure, but the risk of something going wrong and dying horribly also increases with your distance from London.\n+Everything has lore, and lots of it. If you're not a fan of reading a lot, this game isn't for you.\n+Randomization of events keeps the game interesting as you make your rounds collecting port reports.\n\nCons:\n-Permadeath. With a game this lore heavy, permadeath should not be a thing. You can avoid permadeath by making manual saves, but you'll still lose lots of time every time you die and read/skip the same things over again.\n-The game actively punishes you for going faster. You'll have worse fuel efficiency with stronger engines and you can only do an event once per day (roughly a minute at zee), so quickly hopping from island to island is kind of pointless.\n-The combat is super basic. For ships, stay behind them and shoot them. For monsters, back away and shoot them. That's it.\n\nOverall, I'd give it a 6/10. I loved exploring the world, but once it was explored I had to mine for more stories, killing tons of time in the process. Initial impressions are excellent, but the late game suffers from slow gameplay and the same stories you've heard before.

There's a reason I call it Funless Sea.\n\nThe good part is that the developers have crafted a weird, wonderful world populated with interesting stories and artwork. The mood is great. The world is interesting. The stories are kind of cool and occasionally not just a little messed up in the head. The world is the same close to your base but in every game it gets more and more randomized the further you get. That's a wonderful gameplay idea and I give serious props to the devs for creating such a great universe.\n\nUnfortunately, they didn't know what to do with it. People will talk about the decent writing, the dark mood, the truly unique world that was created when they praise this game. What they don't talk about is the gameplay and that's where this falls flat. There is no direction and there are really no aims in this game. You get in a ship and go...wherever. It doesn't really seem to matter. You'll find a rare workable trade route and do nothing but grind it as long as you can because money is hard to come by. You'll visit the same ports over and over getting nothing but port reports for a few echos (dollars) at a time when it takes tens of thousands to get a new ship. The pace of the ship is ponderous (and that's being kind). So underneath this interesting world the game devolves into a slow, dull grind. It's really a shame because even mediocre gameplay mechanics could have gone a long way here.\n\nYes, the pace is supposed to reflect the tension of your slowly deteriorating crew. To some respect it does that. But more often than not my head just wants to hit the keyboard from playing this. My time is more valauble than that. Most of the people I've talked to that have "enjoyed" the game used cheats to boost their gold to get somewhere in this bore-fest. I love good exploration games, but this feels aimless and pointless to me.\n\nNot that I haven't give it a chance. I tried buying it and then returned it under the Steam policy. I tried again when they had a free weekend and really tried to like this game. But I just can't find the fun in it. Funless Sea - such a great world marred by such boring gameplay.","June 18, 2015","false","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Don Draper","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TheWerepyreKing/","392 products in account","Overall  Recommended to fans of indie games, roguelikes, and even fans of flash games. It really does remind me of flash games where you will improve over time, and calmly go through your tasks in the face of danger. However, it really does have more depth than any flash game.\n\nThe idea of the game is to become an explorer and meet everyone one could meet. One might have different identifiers (essentially boolean characterstics), companions, etc. Money is only a means to this. In my opinion, discovering everything and progressing the story is primary, but I need money to do it, so sometimes I am coerced into going back to Whither for some extra cash for recon.\nThe game relies on fuel and food. Neither are too scarce if you scout for the royal navy a lot. Be careful though.\nWatch like 5 minutes of gameplay, it's pretty straightforward.\n\nPros    Great music; quite surprising\nVery atmospheric, the setting is immersive More like submersive, amirite? with a Dickensian England style, even altering English to accomodate the setting. (Even if it's just replacing "Sea" with "Zee", it still is cool)\nStoryline is intriguing and very mysterious. The multiple choices for each encounter, along with skill checks, ties everything to you and your choices. Nothing is truly unfair and all choices are usually valid.\nDiscovering a new world really is rewarding and fun, with no real annoyances once you discover how to make money. It was awesome to find a culty Church and accidentally become a cannibal for free food; and not punishing when it shouldn't be.\nGreat quest system with lots of different effects, items, etc. centered around exploration for the Admirality.\nCons    Quite difficult to begin with, I actually gave up after two hours but tried again later. Basically you've got to rely on scouting places and important research reports.\nSome people may not like the permadeath (although there is a manual save option) or the game in general. Can't do much about that.\nCombat is essentially "Who is stronger? You or them?", because boats are hard to steer and getting attacked by two enemies sequentially is devestating.\n(Not a real negative) There's a gap between when you have money and when you don't. It could be easy to go too far away if not paying attention.\nThe ship is pretty slow sometimes.","April 15, 2015","true","19.3"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Seriously, souls are literally a tradeable commodity. But anyways, London fell down into this cavern called the "Neath" some time ago, and you happen to be the captain of a ship in the zee. You'll die a lot and sail a lot in the hopes that one day, one of your captains will make it.\n\nThe game's mechanics are pretty simple if not repetitive. You explore in your ship and complete missions, going back and forth between the vast zee and Fallen London peddling goods and services for money. There are three key elements to your survival: fuel, food and terror, which is essentially just sanity. You must also manage your crew, as there are penalties for letting them fall below half your ship's maximum capacity; conversely, having too many crew members can also drain your food very quickly. Combat can be avoided easily, as you are much faster than most enemies and the enemies seem to have a very small aggro range. You can complete the game by finishing one of three goals you establish at the beginning of the game or by a hidden fourth, and you can pass on your wealth to future generations with a will. Events on islands are text-based and make use of probability, so if that isn't your cup of tea, look elsewhere.\n\nYour main goal in this game is money. There are two highly lucrative trade routes in Sunless Sea: coffee and sunlight, both of which will end entirely after you have made a certain amount of runs. This is one of two big issues I have with the game: once these trade routes are gone, it is virtually impossible to establish a consistent source of income through trade. You have to scrape by with whatever you made during those runs because you won't be getting much money that you don't have to spend on supplies or fuel just to survive. I never felt like I was succeeding in the game after reaching this point.\n\nThe second issue I take with the game is the story, which has a lot of problematic similarities to a game like Dark Souls II.  They give you just enough lore and background to make the world seem interesting and grand, but inevitably, it's disappointing and relies too much on its predecessor. In this case, Sunless Sea is the child of an interactive text adventure named Fallen London, and unfortunately, the developers seemed a bit too proud of Fallen London to let it go. Much of the story in Sunless Sea is reliant on concepts developed in Fallen London, so the game's own story is underdeveloped and very unwelcoming to newcomers. The world established is interesting but vague at best, and Sunless Sea cannot stand on its own, which is unfortunate because it is a good game.\n\nOverall? Sunless Sea is a good game. The story is underdeveloped, and the game itself has moments where it is very poorly balanced. Still, it's quirky and fun and good for sinking (ha!) a few hours in the immersive world. I would buy it on sale if it appeals to you because I personally think it's a fun game to play with a lot of good ideas and heart and soul.","June 6, 2015","true","24.6"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","3","5","0","0"

An enormous crab ate one of my crew and proceeded to destroy my ship.  An enormous Albino Moray devoured three of my crew in battle before finally dying. I've made literal deals with a devil. I've battled a horde of guinea pigs. I've explored the darkest caverns of the Unterzee and survived (though I can't say the same for my crew). I've smuggled souls from here to Hell and back. I've battled hideous abominations off Port Cecil.  One of my men stole a lifeboat and rowed off into the darkness because I shot a white bat. I murdered a harbinger of Salt (an Unterzee god) and subsequently was cursed. My lover subsequently died because I was cursed. I survived a mutiny. I fought Clayman pirates and died a horrible death. I've scuttled pirate ships and sold them for scrap.  I sold mushroom wine to Pirate-monks. I fought Lifebergs and killed some, while others I appeased with a sacrifice. I explored the frozen wastes of the northern Unterzee. I took a burned girl in as one of my officers. I got murdered by a giant black cloud of death.\nI've amassed a fortune smuggling and selling mushroom wine. I've also subsequently ♥♥♥♥♥♥ it all away on shore leave.\n\n\nThe lore surrounding the Fallen London universe is very rich and Sunless Sea definitely captures the atmosphere of it.  If any of this sounds like gibberish you should definitely go check out Fallen London (it's a free browser based game) to get some backstory.\n\nTLDR: I highly recommend this game for fans of Fallen London or people looking for a unique setting filled with all kinds of interesting things. Mediocre combat, great atmosphere, interesting occurences, and fun for short play sessions imo.\n\nTIPS: -The terror meter goes up quite quickly at times and can make journeys tedious as you'll have to stop at a port to reduce terror levels.\n-Shore leave is not cheap, so save every echo you get.\n-Try trading with the monks on Godfall or smuggling Clay men from Polythreme for some quick cash.\n-Buy a decent cannon as early as possible, preferably one with harpoons, since they work best for sea monsters.\nIf you're fighting Lifebergs make sure you kill them as quickly as possible. They can one shot your starting boat.

While you explore, you may encounter dangers like giant crabs, corsairs or your own mind, as well as the trouble of running out of supplies/fuel.\nIt is really merciless, unless you play in merciful mode (but who would do that) where you can save manually. The gameplay itself is rather simple, as you mostly drive your boat around on the hunt for new areas and stories, which leads me to the main point of the game: The story and the atmosphere, both supported by the excellent soundtrack and art-style.

You will die early and often, and be forced to repeat the early game again and again. Neither combat nor trading are open to the early game. Allegedly there's a lot of narrative depth that shows up in the mid-to-late game, but as far as I can tell, they've done a great job hiding it.\n\nEven the developer agrees that these are the core problems in the game:\n\nOriginally posted by Developer:Sunless Sea has the punishing early difficulty, permadeath, and some of the randomness of a roguelike. It has the rich story, predictable early-game, slow pace, and flat late-game difficulty arc of a CRPG. We even have a default roguelike permadeath save system and an optional more CRPG-like save system.\n\nThis is the source of very nearly everything that’s wrong with the game. It’s left us with an uneven difficulty curve.\nHere's a link to the postmortem discussion with the developer at Gamasutra, worth reading if you're on the fence:\n\nGamasutra Postmortem of Sunless Sea[gamasutra.com]\n\nTHE COMMUNITY\nOriginally posted by Cornuthaum:SS early game needs to be made easier and more accessible, or all you'll be left with is an echo chamber of veterans who know all the little tricks and -don't spot the issues with the early game because they know how to get around them-.\nUsually with indie games one can count on a vibrant community of players who are eager to help others enjoy the game. This isn't the case with Sunless Sea. Here you've got a small yet vocal group of Kickstarter / Greenlight / Early Access players with chips on their shoulders, who seem rather upset that others may not love the game in which they are so invested.\n\nWhen new players ask for starting advice these are typical responses:\n\nOriginally posted by HVA God Damned Hippopotamus:There is nothing wrong with the game. This is a case of you being bad.\nOriginally posted by Tresixth:poor kids... use your head. try and fail, try again, try something different. dont stop trying. cause its not this game thats a fail. its you...\nSadly, the community has also influenced the game in negative ways.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/recommended/304650/","SexyDemonGoat","Baphomet","http://steamcommunity.com/id/SexyDemonGoat/","314 products in account","Sunless Sea is a naval action-roguelike with a bit of a british folklore spin. You play a sea captain tasked with an arbitrary goal (selected at start) and a small boat and crew. Through exploration and challenges, you are expected to grow as a character and gain additional crew, cargo, and special items. There is a great deal of lore to be found to help explain the universe your character lives in as well as his or her backstory and ties to local people and culture that grow as you interact with them.\n\nSunless Sea takes an interesting approach to handling the whole roguelike mechanic by treating just about everything as an item. Rather than gaining levels, you build secrets from fragments of discovered places and successful challenges, and then spend those secrets on boosting your stats. Additionally, it will be necessary for you to manage the terror stat, which slowly increases whenever you are in dark waters or suffering consequences from failed challenges. Hunger also plays a factor and you will need to keep a healthy amount of supplies handy in order to feed your crew. Lastly you must manage fuel consumption through meticulous navigation and careful use of the oil lamps.\n\nUnfortunately, that’s about where all the good points for this game end. Combat is slow paced and typically the belligerent with the greater firepower or hull strength will win, regardless of piloting skill. The majority of your time will be spent doing tedious errands from point A to point B while desperately trying to conserve fuel, supplies, and mitigating terror. It’s definitely as boring as it sounds and despite all the attempts at creating a humorous or entertaining narrative, the story starts getting repetitive the 3rd or 4th time through.\n\nSimply put, Sunless Sea just wasn’t as fun I thought it was going to be. The premise is interesting: Naval battles in a London-esque setting in a sea “under the sea” fraught with terror and danger. The execution, on the other hand, is incredibly dull and left me wondering what else I could spend my time on. From what I’ve read on forums, the game used to be a lot more fun/playable but a good deal of that has diminished in the light of recent patches. Play at your own risk.","March 27","false","9.7"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","57","4","7","0","2"

This is basically what Sunless Sea gameplay looks like. In theory it's about sailing a boat over titular sea filled with dangerous monsters, wondrous islands and terrors beyond comprehension, discovering gorgeous new places and desperately trying to stay alive in face of adversity. In practice... it's about waiting until you reach destination where you can read a page or two and make one choice before waiting again.\nSummary: boring in default state, but can be modded into a very good game.\n\nThe good.\n\nWriting and World.\n\nWriting is excellent and world has very rich lore. Creators had a lot of incredible ideas, and with help of vast vocabulary, executed them very well. Being non-native speaker, despite my demonstrably good grasp of English I had to reach for help of dictionaries very often (this is NOT a complaint, it's a testament to writer's knowledge of English and it's less often used vocabulary). Graphics are great, illustrations presented along encounters are nice if a bit arbitrary, nonetheless they go well with descriptions which range from vividly gruesome to laconically terrifying and sea (referred to as zee) itself is as good as 2D sprites can get. How good 2D sprites can get depends a bit on your mileage, for me lack of 3rd dimension doesn't detract at all.\n\nFrom worldbuilding and artistic standpoint, it's definitely a 10/10.\n\nUnfortunately as far as advantages go, that's it.\n\nThe bad.\n\nCombat.\n\nCombat is terribly executed - it's either impossible to win because you don't have right gear/stats to beat this enemy, or you have right gear and just do the same thing over and over to blast enemy without risk (hint: kiting).\n\nTravel.\n\nTravel is slow. Mind-numbingly slow, and as you progress to more powerful engines, it gets only marginally better. Authors claim it's for atmosphere of terror. Except that despite being slow as snail, even the most basic engine can eventually outrun every enemy, so there's literally no danger in combat. Only danger in travel comes from depleting resources (fuel, food and sanity) and random events that occur close to never. Sure, reaching London on last half of a barrel of fuel was a great relief, but that single moment came after trip that took hour or so of transit alone out of which only last minute held any tension at all. Definitely not worth it. It's as if Jagged Alliance 2 devs decided to make everything turn-based instead of engaging TB only in combat and letting players explore locations in real time otherwise (when there are enemies in location, JA2 is RT until you stumble upon them, or until they stumble upon you, then it goes into TB until 2 turns go without any combat or all enemies are killed), JA2 would be pretty much unplayable. Similarly, SS should have had *2 or *3, perhaps even *4 time settings that would automatically disengage as soon as enemy appears on screen or your resources run below certain threshold. Watching boat zail (in-game term) the zee for hours is not fun and heavily discourages exploration.\n\nUgh, I don't know. It doesn't crash inexplicably, controls are responsive, collision detection is fine. 3/10?\n\nThe Ugly.\n\nCurrency and economic balance.\nYour ship needs fuel, your zailors need supplies, if you run out of either, it's game over. If you spend too long in the zee and run out of sanity, it's game over. If you run out of cash to buy supplies it's effectively game over. There's nothing inherently wrong in above, "imbalance", now that's what IS wrong. Fuel/Supplies consumption is high and starting boat has very small cargo hold, this means that trade is extremely hard hard or often impossible. Round trip to other edge of map with basic boat, engine and skeleton crew takes full hold worth of supplies, unless you get lucky with map generation, you are not going anywhere in early game. Trade routes available near your (fixed)starting location/(forced)base of operations don't even net enough to cover expenses (with basic cargo hold size). So what are you supposed to do? Explore because admiralty pays echos (cash) and fuel for reports from other ports. Problem is, they pay so little it doesn't even cover expenses. Trying to combine trade with admiralty payouts may net you double digit profit. You need 7000 for boat with bigger cargo hold.\n\nLiterally your only option to progress in game is to risk everything, fill your your cargo hold with enough food and fuel for a one way trip to edge of map and venture forth, not even thinking about turning back until you reach 2/3 of map, at which point your starting supplies aren't enough to get back. Unless you got lucky and found some supplies, cash, valuable cargo AND place with cheap fuel along the way, you are screwed. That doesn't actually sound bad, does it? Well, what DOES sound bad is the following: if you lucked out and came back, your loot and admiralty payouts may net you as much as 500 echoes after expenses. After an hour or longer trip out of which 55 minutes were spent watching zee go by, and only 5 reading about thrilling encounters. Oh, and by the way, you don't start with enough cash/resources for trip like that, you need to figure something out, sorry.\n\nNow you need to do that 20 more times to upgrade and equip your ship. If you die, you start over. If you pick wrong choice in event, you start over. If you misjudge your supplies, you start over. If you lose RGN roll, you start over. If you start over, map is re-generated slightly, but contains all the same locations so unless you progress further than in previous life, you won't see anything new. A bit of your stats or cash carry over from prior life to next one, and there are ways to set up your next Capitan with tiny bit of starting budget, but we are talking about doing exact same thing for 10 hours just to die so you can do exact same thing for 10 hours in next life until, perhaps, after hundreds of hours you eventually get to endgame content. If you play like that you are going to see one, maybe 2 new things in each new in-game life!\n\n\nAll in all, tagline of this game is:\nLose your mind. Eat your crew. Die.\nIt should be:\nLose your mind. Of boredom. Eat your crew. Of boredom. Die. Of boredom.\n\n1/10 for balance.\n\n\nThe Good. (Again?)\nThat doesn't mean that game is NOT salvageable.\nEditing either saves or game files to diminish time wasting parts turns Sunless Sea into very interesting experience, and a game definitely worth playing. Exact changes depend on preference, most fair way is to change game constants so that everything runs faster (ships and combat but also fuel/food/sanity depletion) and occasionally edit save to double/triple profit from last trip.\n\nLuckily, saves and relevant game files are (mostly) human readable and don't use even simplest measures (like checksums) to detect meddling so pretty much anyone can quickly tweak them, hence title of my review. I, however, refuse to give thumb up to game that needs to have it's internals meddled with to be playable, despite the fact that I liked it a lot AFTER tweaking. Just no.\n\nCombat unfortunately is a smouldering wreck that can't be made fun so easily. Way too much modding required.\n\nSummary.\nNo recommendation and my personal score of 4/10 for default state.\n"*4" button, small increase in admiralty payouts and intermediate boat with 70 cargo for 3k echos and this would have been a positive review with personal score of 8/10. As they say: close but no cookie.\n\nIrony of my review being as boring as unmodded game is NOT lost on me.","February 4","false","71.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","5","9","0","0"

It's like reading the same (unconnected) chapters of a book over and over, while having to wait hours to get to a new part of the book.\n\nThe game may seem much better and bigger on the first glance (probably the reason for the good critic ratings), but a few hours in, you'll notice that the senseless grinding never stops and the gameplay doesn't get any better, but much worse due to the repetition and lack of progression (ingame prices are just way too high to get any better equipment in less than 6-10 hours of grinding).\n\nThe game is a dull grind without proper gameplay except waiting for your incredibly slow ship to get anywhere. While the story texts may be new and pretty the first time you see them... that's about it. The events and stories will repeat the same way over and over. The game has a heritage system and runs on 'ironman' on standard, but at the same time a dreadfully slow progression that conflicts with these systems. Combat isn't fun (mostly because you're ridicilously outgunned in 80%+ of the fights), reading the same passages over and over again (especially if you dared to die!) isn't either, and idlely waiting 5-10 mins+ for the next tiny tidbit of writing just doesn't make the game worth playing. And don't forget that after 6-10h+ of grinding, you may end up getting insta-killed by some scripted event, because you dared to 'explore the zee' and tried to obtain an item from one of the low level quests.

There is still some grinding involved in order to get enough echo's for larger ships and upgrades but all in all it isn't too bad. Terror is more manageable now. Still a few bugs here and there but nothing totally game breaking. Randomly generated maps have been instated, and there's a lot more story content since my original review. Game has a much better combat system now with it being live action, more enemies both creature wise and other pirate ship wise. The story content is great, and the artwork even though it's a 2d game looks great the environmental animations bring the world to life, although I  would like to see more added. Over all game play has improved greatly. Can't wait to see and play this game in the final form.\n/Update\n\n\nThis game has the potential to be a great game, as long as the DEV continue to update and add more content on a regular basis.\n\nThere is a lot of room for improvement as far as the Economy of the game is concerned, Trade goods pricing need to be balanced better, so you can actually make a little $ transporting goods from one place to another. With the current prices it's one hell of a grind to make enough echoes for upgrades and supplies so you can continue to play.\n\nTerror also needs a bit of work, in my opinion. There needs to be better ways of combating terror when at sea, or at the very least, the methods that are in place currently to combat terror need to be changed so they actually help to reduce it by a more significant amount instead of only removing 1-5 points of terror at a time. Also for as fast as Terror builds up and increases when out at sea, I think by returning home to Fallen London, terror levels should be reduced more than to just the 50 level, or at least add the chance for it to be reduced further than just 50, perhaps a chance for it to be reduced to 25 or even a slight chance of being reset to 0. Getting your terror level reduced to 50 doesn't allow much room for longer journeys especially early on in the game when you don't have the echoes to purchase upgrades that can help with speed, therefore causing less terror to build up.\n\nAll in all, like I said above this game has huge potential, It's an enjoyable game to play as is, but definitely needs balance changes made in the economy to allow less of a grind when starting a new career.\n\nVery high potential in current standings to be a great game upon the completion of the early access stage but It is still an Early Access Game that needs and will hopefully be getting updates and tweaks made regularly.\n\nI can see how this game in its current state might turn quite a few people off, b/c it is such a grind getting started. The grind can lead to boredom (doing the same run over and over b/c it's the only way to make echo's at current) or due to the combat system in its current state (very predictable). But once again this is an Early Access Game. I can only hope that the DEV will listen to their consumers and make changes accordingly.","July 4, 2014","true","76.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Look out.\n\nI've played Fallen London - the game this was based off of, made by Failbetter too- not long after I found this game, but I didn't get the game as soon as I saw it. After maybe two weeks I decided that Fallen London was amazingly detailed for being text-based, and got this game.\nThis game is much like its browser equivalent, but this gives you more of a feeling that you have control over what could happen on "the Unterzee" than you could in London itself. In fact, some of your actions in the free to play can affect some events in this, and vice versa. Having an account can also bring new stories to your experience and also allow at least one event in Fallen London (could be more, I've gotten one as of yet) to affect your next run on the zee.\nI bought this game back in early acess and really want to see this game do well. It has so much content to offer and as I can tell, will have even moreso over time. There's enough variation to merit multiple runs as well (assuming someone can make it to a "happy" ending for their character) even though some quests sound the same at face value.\n\nOverall, the game is great! It runs fine on my labtop and hasn't had a bug as of yet, and can really appeal to people who enjoy good atmospheres. Though, (as I said before) it's mostly text based, so (as EVERYONE who suggested this game said before) people who don't want to read the story (/ event / whatever-you-got-yourself-into) then you'd be better off with something else for your time.","February 13, 2015","true","10.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I never knew about Fallen London until now but i still haven't really looked into the F2P game. Saying that i just want to point out that i love the art style of this game and its story telling is very immersive. But being the early access it is it does lack alot of content. For example, the stories of the officers aren't all quite there. And then there is the map which is unfinished (not a bad thing). But what Sunless Sea does have it's pretty good. Except for the combat which was confusing at first. The music really sets the mood for the place your in which can make you feel safe or put you on edge. What I really want from this game is for there to be more random encounters which makes feel each life different for better or for worse. I also want more stuff to do in this game like missions i have to do for different people at different locations like monster hunting, bounty hunter or helping them sail to a different location. And the rewards would be a discount at shops, echoes (Currency), or a treasure map or something I don't know.\n\nI have very high hopes for this game and I feel like it's going to be an even bigger hit than it is now.\nBut if your looking to get this game do some research because I feel this game isn't for everyone.\n\nI would also like them to add Trading Cards :)","July 17, 2014","true","10.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

As you can tell from the market page, this is about humans being forced underground because of some war with bats, I don't know, I wasn't really paying attention. Anyway, there is this massive underground sea you can traverse to hunt pirates, sea monsters, explore, or trade across.\n\nAt present (July 6, 2014) this game needs a LOT of work. Firstly, there are some major bugs, secondly some game mechanics need rewriting (for example ship hardpoints - a bigger ship should have more hardpoints yes? but other than hull points the larger ships have little benefit over smaller ones(, and thirdly, the world is just too darn small!\n\nWhat this game needs is::\n- a randomised world builder which would populate a massive world with random islands, settlements, and ports, to make the experience truly endless\n- more ship types\n- more monster types\n- more civilian ship traffic, every other ship is a pirate!\n- a whole bunch of interface and mechanics changes.\n\nTo conclude, it looks like a test for travel and storyline parts of the games core, but will still need some fundamental changes to be any good. As irritated as I get by early access games I pay for that never get finished, I really hope this one gets there because all its current failings aside, it has potential.","July 6, 2014","true","16.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After a couple of deaths by crabs and pirates, I think I have spotted a few things that are missing.\n1. Some type of warning when you move into more dangerous waters would be great. Right now, the transition from easy crabs and pirates to really tricky (for a beginner) crabs and pirates are 0.5-1 screen, and there is no indication from either mission descriptions or comments from the crew that you can't handle the fight ahead.\n2. The beginners area with fairly easy monsters is small, which means you have to grind the same encounters until you get a better equipped ship. Couple this with how easy it is to screw up and die, it gets frustrating really fast.\n3. The writing is good, but there has to be a whole lot more content for it to be a game worth the money. Parts of old journals, rumours at the inns, etc., preferably that lets the player figure out where a treasure is hidden (without an actual quest in the journal) could work great.\n\nI realise that I may sound a bit negative, but if I didn't like the game, I would just stop playing.","July 19, 2014","true","11.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Look out.\n\nI've played Fallen London - the game this was based off of, made by Failbetter too- not long after I found this game, but I didn't get the game as soon as I saw it. After maybe two weeks I decided that Fallen London was amazingly detailed for being text-based, and got this game.\nThis game is much like its browser equivalent, but this gives you more of a feeling that you have control over what could happen on "the Unterzee" than you could in London itself. In fact, some of your actions in the free to play can affect some events in this, and vice versa. Having an account can also bring new stories to your experience and also allow at least one event in Fallen London (could be more, I've gotten one as of yet) to affect your next run on the zee.\nI bought this game back in early acess and really want to see this game do well. It has so much content to offer and as I can tell, will have even moreso over time. There's enough variation to merit multiple runs as well (assuming someone can make it to a "happy" ending for their character) even though some quests sound the same at face value.\n\nOverall, the game is great! It runs fine on my labtop and hasn't had a bug as of yet, and can really appeal to people who enjoy good atmospheres. Though, (as I said before) it's mostly text based, so (as EVERYONE who suggested this game said before) people who don't want to read the story (/ event / whatever-you-got-yourself-into) then you'd be better off with something else for your time.","February 13, 2015","true","10.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There is still some grinding involved in order to get enough echo's for larger ships and upgrades but all in all it isn't too bad. Terror is more manageable now. Still a few bugs here and there but nothing totally game breaking. Randomly generated maps have been instated, and there's a lot more story content since my original review. Game has a much better combat system now with it being live action, more enemies both creature wise and other pirate ship wise. The story content is great, and the artwork even though it's a 2d game looks great the environmental animations bring the world to life, although I  would like to see more added. Over all game play has improved greatly. Can't wait to see and play this game in the final form.\n/Update\n\n\nThis game has the potential to be a great game, as long as the DEV continue to update and add more content on a regular basis.\n\nThere is a lot of room for improvement as far as the Economy of the game is concerned, Trade goods pricing need to be balanced better, so you can actually make a little $ transporting goods from one place to another. With the current prices it's one hell of a grind to make enough echoes for upgrades and supplies so you can continue to play.\n\nTerror also needs a bit of work, in my opinion. There needs to be better ways of combating terror when at sea, or at the very least, the methods that are in place currently to combat terror need to be changed so they actually help to reduce it by a more significant amount instead of only removing 1-5 points of terror at a time. Also for as fast as Terror builds up and increases when out at sea, I think by returning home to Fallen London, terror levels should be reduced more than to just the 50 level, or at least add the chance for it to be reduced further than just 50, perhaps a chance for it to be reduced to 25 or even a slight chance of being reset to 0. Getting your terror level reduced to 50 doesn't allow much room for longer journeys especially early on in the game when you don't have the echoes to purchase upgrades that can help with speed, therefore causing less terror to build up.\n\nAll in all, like I said above this game has huge potential, It's an enjoyable game to play as is, but definitely needs balance changes made in the economy to allow less of a grind when starting a new career.\n\nVery high potential in current standings to be a great game upon the completion of the early access stage but It is still an Early Access Game that needs and will hopefully be getting updates and tweaks made regularly.\n\nI can see how this game in its current state might turn quite a few people off, b/c it is such a grind getting started. The grind can lead to boredom (doing the same run over and over b/c it's the only way to make echo's at current) or due to the combat system in its current state (very predictable). But once again this is an Early Access Game. I can only hope that the DEV will listen to their consumers and make changes accordingly.","July 4, 2014","true","76.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The idea seems to be to get out and explore the way you want. When fear, hunger, and overpowered enemies are practically unavoidable why in the hell would I waste my time on this game?","October 2, 2014","true","8.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A mash of steam-punk and 20,000 leagues under the sea.\n\nYou're the captain of a ship and its crew and you sail the under-zee to explore and survive and it's only a matter of time that your survivability is tested due to fuel, rations or the "terrror" of being on the open water. It has a vast storyline which does not let you set a true course but make you decide on the route you wish to choose... and you will probably always choose the wrong compass pointing.\n\nDeath is a brand new beginning where the map has changed and brings another range of depth to the game.... and possible frustration.. but alarmingly the will to set sail again and beat the zee!\n\nThe more you play, the more you question if it's worth travelling to the other end of the zee to sell off cargo which could bring you some more valued coin and meet that person to finish part of that odd quest. Do I really want to battle that pirate ship? Oh heck, a sea monster... FULL SPEED AHEAD! How much for fuel?!? What no rations!!!\n\nThe variables to dying are many and your calculations to setting sail is either numbered by cargo you want to sell to the ratio of fuel and rations to get you there. Their are guides out there for the quick game - but I express that you play this genuiunely for at least 4-5 deaths before you look for help.\n\nThis game is a must buy for the person who likes adventure.

The artistic style of the game is what initially caught my eye and forced me to give it a try. Before playing, it is important to read the in game manual, which explains the basics of the game or else you will feel a little a lost.\n\nNow for the review. The game is beautiful and the visuals did not dissapoint me once during my time playing. The artistic style and atmosphere of the game is definitely the main selling point it would seem. The music is great and the well done sound effects help out with the immersion as well. The gameplay seems to be decent but even early on its easy to see that combat is poorly done. Exploring is great and is the most exciting aspect of the gameplay. The part of the gameplay that is a turn off is the grind factor. Supplies and money are definitely hard to attain. In order to have a hefty amount of supplies and wealth needed to further explore, you need to start out doing the same missions every life. If you die a lot, which seems probable, this will get very monotonous doing the same missions over and over. Also reading is critical if you want to know the story of the game and immerse yourself. Personally, the reading didn't bother me one bit but if you are someone that doesn't enjoy reading, then this game is most likely not for you. Lastly the game has slow pacing since it takes a while to travel. So if thats a good thing or bad thing, that's up to you.\n\nNOW IS THE GAME WORTH THE $18? NO\nI do recommend this game but not at the full asking price. At the sale price of $11, the purchase is much more tempting and for those on the edge, do get it. For those that feel they can overcome the grinding factor, this game will be worth it. For me, a reasonable price for the game is around $5-6 and I will wait to get this game until the price reaches that point. The subpar gameplay and grinding aspects of the game turn me away from the Sunless Sea even at the $11 price tag as of right now.","February 9","true","1.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Whenever you discover an island a new interesting story awaits you and the main part of the game begins.. reading. You will read a lot. I spent roughly 70% of my playtime reading. Just reading. But that's not a bad thing at all. Every island is unique and after approximately 12 hours with 1 captain I haven't even discovered all islands, let alone all the stories of the islands I already discovered (you need specific items for some of them).\nKeep in mind though that this game is only available in English and the texts are sometimes hard to understand, as there are several words you are probably unfamiliar with if English is not your native language (I learn English over 10 years now and I had to look some words up to understand everything).

Dying often does not immediately cut down on the replayability of the game, as many of the text-based narratives allow you to explore different options. As such replayability increases by not sticking to the same beaten path and trying out different backgrounds and directions to explore. After thirthy hours of play and a number of captains I still have two or three places left to explore, and the end-game is still open to me, which keeps the game interesting and fun to play for me. However, I cannot speak for what happens to the fun of replaying after a full first playtrough.\n\nThat being said, I personally advise against playing in hardmode after a certain point. The game has this hypnotizing atmosphere and quality, but that loses its charm once you have to go back to that ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ship and engine after your previous captain died. The random number generator can really destroy the best planned route to the other side of the map, especially when your gambling with fuel and terror. The later ships don't mitigate this fact, as the increasing crew numbers offset your cargo capacity and food consumption: well-balanced or unpleasent surprise, up to the player I guess. There is a discrepency in the slow, relaxed way of discovering all the nararives and the possibility of the destruction of one's enthousiasm for the game in the roguelike hardmode of play. If frustration is your thing, be my guest, but I advice to leave this roguelike quality to games where it actually fits.\n\nI recommend this game for its unique storytelling and atmosphere, and for that would definitly recommend people to buy it. Learn the game on hardmode, and saving once you have your first proper ship and 4000 credit engines is my advice on the way to truly get the most out of this game.\n\ntl;dr:\n+ Unique storytelling and atmosphere.\n+ Well balanced economy and progression into late game.\n- disconnect between roguelike and slow progress of text-based adventure: consider playing on casual to get most out of the game after a certain point in progression.\n","June 20, 2015","true","40.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

A mash of steam-punk and 20,000 leagues under the sea.\n\nYou're the captain of a ship and its crew and you sail the under-zee to explore and survive and it's only a matter of time that your survivability is tested due to fuel, rations or the "terrror" of being on the open water. It has a vast storyline which does not let you set a true course but make you decide on the route you wish to choose... and you will probably always choose the wrong compass pointing.\n\nDeath is a brand new beginning where the map has changed and brings another range of depth to the game.... and possible frustration.. but alarmingly the will to set sail again and beat the zee!\n\nThe more you play, the more you question if it's worth travelling to the other end of the zee to sell off cargo which could bring you some more valued coin and meet that person to finish part of that odd quest. Do I really want to battle that pirate ship? Oh heck, a sea monster... FULL SPEED AHEAD! How much for fuel?!? What no rations!!!\n\nThe variables to dying are many and your calculations to setting sail is either numbered by cargo you want to sell to the ratio of fuel and rations to get you there. Their are guides out there for the quick game - but I express that you play this genuiunely for at least 4-5 deaths before you look for help.\n\nThis game is a must buy for the person who likes adventure. This is not for people who want fast action... it takes time ... and your thoughts on the zee drift ... to possibly another cup of coffee.\n\nI look forward to more content.. please!\n\n9 out of 10 terrorised zee-urchins!","June 26, 2015","true","39.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I really enjoy storytelling and the dark, gothic, macabre world of Fallen London and Sunless Sea are truly inspired and fleshed out.\n\nThe game is essentially and exploration game with some Choose Your Own adventure elements. Each place you discover will have a storyline that you can affect. Based on inventory, who your crew is, whether you have news or not, or what choices you have made in other stories, you can progress to gain rewards.\nThe rewards are mostly monetary based, or Secret based. You use money to upgrade your ship and to buy fuel and supplies (Which you will need) and you use Secrets to upgrade your Captain or complete quests.\n\nThe game is difficult and it is similar to games like Rogue Legacy in that you are NOT expected to complete the game on your first Captain. A big mechanic is writing a Will. This costs money (Of Course) and allows you to pass possessions on to your next Captain. You WILL die. But that is okay.\n\nI have spent a considerable amount of time playing the game and have not completed it. The atmosphere and music are compelling and the stories unfold in unexpected ways; the first time.\n\nLater Captains will complete the same storylines as the previous Captains, so the longer you play, the more it becomes a game of clicking throught the text of each story to get to the choices. It is unfortunate.\n\nI still highly reccomend this game, especially for Fallen London players or people who enjoy Atmospheric exploration titles.\n\n7/10","August 1, 2015","true","24.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It was well worth the cost.\n\nVideo Review:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W_VGE5YEGA\n\nWhat is it?\n\nSunless Sea is a rouge-like adventure game where you play as a steamship captain of the Underzee. Your victory condition is determined by what you choose at the beginning of the game, which could be a lust for wealth, knowledge, or to find your past (although you could happen upon other ways to win as you play).\n\nGamplay consists of choices that you have to make throughout the game. It could range from choosing whether to listen to or attack a bandit to choosing a side in the rodent wars (not joking). Beyond that, you must ensure that your vessel is properly stocked and you need to plot a course. The outcome of these choices is often determined by one of the five stats that your captain has.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Sunless Sea is not an action filled rouge like. The action is mostly played out in the text that the game provides that player. You will also fight on the open Zee, but that is a small portion of the game overall.\n\nPros:\n\n-This game has an amazing sense of humor. It comes straight from Wells, Shelly, and even a bit of Crusoe while mixing in Lovecraftian horror.\n\n-The choices are numerous. You can go anywhere in the Underzee form the beginning of the game, and from that you have a plethora of things that you could do.\n\n-The choices are impactful. Deciding to go one way can open a whole new path for you, but it will also cut off another. You'll always feel like your decisions in the game matter.\n\n-The narratives are interesting. I love the stories that have been put into this game. They are mysterious and captivating, and that is a must have for such a narative driven game.\n\n-The atmosphere is palpable. The game sucks you into the dread and mystery of the Underzee. From the wordy style to the beautiful art, the game keeps you on edge.\n\nCons\n\n-There is a lot of reading. Personally I don't see this as a big downside, but if you don't enjoy reading (or want to see lots of neat explosions) this might not be the game for you.\n\n-When you die, you have to do it all over again. This is a particular problem for Sunless Sea. The only thing that actually changes between deaths are the locations of the islands. You will have to play through the same story every time you die.\n\nOverall, I consider this to be a great game that is well worth it's price tag. I'll be playing a lot of it in the days to come.","February 27, 2015","true","21.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Then it's another hour of moving cargo around just to finance your next quest mission. At worst, the quest missions are obscure and unclear. It's 2016 - it's ridiculous that quest logs and exchange graphs are terribly implemented or unavailable.

While this seems like a trivial problem at first, it really hurts you as you try to progress. Small cargo holds mean less fuel and supplies, which means less time that you can spend exploring before having to return to London for supplies. Yes, you can buy fuel and supplies elsewhere, but they are typically more expensive (a problem especially early game) everywhere else. The first ship with a cargo upgrade is ludicrously expensive regardless if you are grinding or playing the game the "right" way as some people have described. This limitation, combined with the "terror" system, a passive timer that counts down before bad things start happening, means you will have to go back to home unless you want to spend a lot of echo (currency) to stay at zee. You also end up aquiring a lot of trinkets and things that will have to be sold or delievered to make space for fuel and supplies.\n\nThis monotony is simply not fun. Simply trading is equally dull, evident from these other reviews.\n\nYes, you can re-visit ports to gain interesting story developments (which is arguably the whole point of this game), but I was always dissapointed as to what those developments were. They give you just a taste before you have to bring them more items or whatever, which, as mentioned, is typically a journey back to London or across the map. Everything just has to be so damn mysterious. You learn more about the world as you play, but even in my hours so many seemingly crucial things were just left unexplained. I never touched the supplementary reading, but then again I really shouldn't have to if this is truely a story based game as it is advertized as.\n\nFinally, let's talk about the legacy system, a sort of new game plus when you die, except not at all. When you die, you start from the ground up in terms of story progression and officer quests. This is bad, as you will essentially be doing the same things over and over again, just slightly quicker, every time you die or decide to start over. Also, your heir doesn't get to keep your ship and loses most of the upgrades. Why. Why is this when you are psuedo-encouraged to die or retire by the developers? I ended up taking a chance on "getting something interesting" for my heir, but the result was ultimately not worth it as I had to start over again.\n\nApparently, this game is still in development, so maybe one day I will give it another shot. But right now, it has too many flaws.","February 4","false","18.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

To come to terms with being insufficiently skilled at something, to accept defeat, and still have the determination to keep going, to get better, more skilled.\n\nGames are excellent at this, particularly in a culture that otherwise seem preoccupied with not acknowledging that people have different talents and different skills. We start from different positions, and some roads will be easier to travel than others.\n\nSunless Sea is not such a game. What Sunless Sea will teach you is to stop caring. You can really only enjoy Sunless sea by not caring about progress, about your character, really about anything.\n\nThe horror of Sunless Sea is not the monsters, but that the correct mindset to play it seems to be one where nothing really matters. That everything you do is pointless. Even if your actions have consequences down the line, the game teaches you to not really care one way or another.\n\nYou are not really navigating the sea, or a maze of stories. In reality, you are being dragged through it in a random fashion, going through the same stories again, and again, and again, with only slight alterations at each playthrough.\n\nIn the end I stopped caring about playing the game. The excellent writing kept me thinking about it, but I really didnt want to play it.\n\nI could only play it when not caring about my progression, and what was happening to my captain; and at the same time, the writing is too good to not care about.","February 28","false","25.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Your starting cargo hold (which is mostly used up by fuel and food for your crew) means you cannot make money by trading.  So how do you make money?   Good freaking question, there are very few ways to make money, and as your ship runs on  money, quite literally as fuel is not cheap (neither is food), this will be your all consuming goal so that after you make enough money you can then think about doing fun things in this game, quests, exploration, etc.\n\nSo once you've invested the hours of work it takes to get a point you don't have to worry about money as much there is not that much fun to be had though.  Quests are laid out horribly in the interface, and nearly every single person you encounter every item of garbage you might have in your hold is given it's own icon that makes everything difficult to discern at a glance.  You will constantly need to look at the wiki for this game to figure out where you might need to go to pick up an item that has a description that doesn't quite make sense.\n\nThis is a horror, cthulu-esque game though, so is it scary?  Does it make you question the fabric of reality and the horrors of life?  Not really, there are many occurrences that are strange, alien, foreign to the extreme, but it is very possible you will stop paying attention to them in game though because they all come up as text boxes when you're trying to do something else.  Fear as an in-game stat is more of an annoyance than anything else and the things that make you afraid don't even make sense often times.  All the fear stat ends up doing is forcing you to return home more often than you might want to, to stop exploring more than you'd want to, to not be able to use a trade route you might want to,  like having a mother reminding you to come inside for dinner at certain times.\n\nThis game is addictive though, you will be getting that arm scratching "I just need to go on one more trip" after you return home every time and at every port you run through.  But after a point the addiction feels more like a skinner box.  I'm sitting around 25 hours played right now and another 35,000 away from retirement and I'm lucky if I can make 1000 in an hour, so why waste another 35-50 hours doing the same trade runs trying to figure out how to get obscure items in order to go through quests that you won't even necessarily be able to acquire when you think you should because you still need to meet three other requirements when you get there and pass a stat challenge that is usually listed at 30%.   In the end all the addictive quality winds up being is like a drug without the high.\n\nOnce again this isn't a bad game, but overly bland, confusing and slow for my taste.","February 28","false","28.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

In the default difficulty, when you die, thats it, you restart with a few bonuses, or many depending on the circumstances of your death. In Sunless Sea you are captain of a vessel sailing some kind of strange ocean. I have not played much but from what I have read and seen in game I believe it to be some sort of underground ocean of some sort, and the humans here some sort of semi undead. I often encounter what comes down to as living mummys, people who just have aged so much they start to fall apart and thus have to move to a "tomb colony".\n\nSunless Sea is very much about exploration and lore. There is so much to read and so many strange things to encounter.  The lore itself and the story feel like a really amazing setting even though the gamelplay itself lacks in many areas. The main focus of the game is exploration, yet the resource system for supply's while out at see its very restricting.\n\nSunless Sea is a good game, I have no doubts about that, but I feel it takes a certain type of person to enjoy it at its fullest.

London was dropped into the "Unterzee" with a unique dark semi-lovecraftian mythology going on; it's an exciting setting.\n\nSo let me make an analogy of why it falls flat to me. I meet some guy with a lightning scar, and I ask him, "Hey, how did you get that scar?" and he replies, "Tom gave it to me."  So I ask, "Who's this Tom guy?" to which he replies, "That's an interesting story," and his red-headed friend says, "that's a wicked story. You gotta hear this." So I say, "Great, how about I buy you two lunch and you tell me all about it?" They agree, I buy lunch, and the only words I hear about the story is how it's a great story, compelling, mysterious, and all that. They never actually tell me the story.\n\nThis is how Sunless Sea seems to me. There are hints of a story here and there, but I usually don't feel involved in it. I collect "secrets" and "knowledge of distant shores", but these are nothing more than currency. There's no story behind these secrets, I just happened to spot an already colonized island in my telescope and "charted" it. There's no actual knowledge in the "knowledge of distant shores", I just happened to meet someone who tells my character a tale, but doesn't actually tell ME anything.\n\nMuch like FTL, several events will occur with multiple choices and resulting outcomes. There are also overarching stories that are broken up into event sized pieces. Events are a great way to break up a long ship voyage, and I agree that it is a good idea to have overarching story lines, but unfortunately the execution of these story lines are the crux of my problem. I don't feel invested in any characters, mysteries, or goals laid out before me.\n\nFor example: I went carousing with my crew, and happened across a random event that gave me the choice of courting a woman who claimed to be a spy, a guy (I don't remember his gimmick), or some random person because "I can't be tied down." I figured the woman was probably lying to make herself sound more interesting, but I chose her anyway on the off chance she had something interesting to tell me. She didn't have anything interesting to tell me, but the next morning, she gave me a locket to remember her by, and when I next set out, I was presented with a choice to toss the locket into the sea in an melodramatic symbolic gesture to break ties with her, or hang onto the locket. I had no reason to care about her one way or the other, so I hung onto it because maybe i'd get a few pence out of it. During the voyage, I happened to make the god Salt a little salty with me (by shooting down one of his white bats... a one-off event I quite liked by the way), and when I returned I got a letter saying this spy girl was gone for good as a result of Salt's enmity. I had no reasons to like this girl, in fact the only things I knew about her were that she claimed to be a spy and she was easy, so this news had no impact on me whatsoever. Jokes on you, Salt!\n\nEven many one-off events could be given a lot more flavor; I met some sisters (I think on Hunter's Island), and could choose to have lunch with any one of them. So I picked one, and as a result I got a brief description of her and the lunch, and received a "knowledge of distant shores" (or something like that). But nowhere does it describe these distant shores, or the tale she tells me. As a result, the character feels like little more than a townperson in final fantasy 1, a single line of dialog and no lasting impression. I feel like this is wasted potential.\n\nI get that there is limited time and budget for this sort of project, and as a result, there must be a balance between quantity of interaction and quality of interaction. So far, it seems like there is a focus on quantity, which should give the game a fair deal of replayability, but due to the lesser quality of interaction, I don't feel compelled to seek out the different options and opportunities. However, it's early access at the time of this writing, and there is some hope on the horizon. Where I feel this quality story interaction could be best served with the upcoming officer quests. As it stands, the only reason to keep an officer aboard is that his stats and secret upgrades are more valuable to you than the next officer for the position. It would be great if the officers (and even your crew) were the people you could get attached to, because they would be the people with you most often. Firing your doctor because of his penchant for getting drunk and spilling secrets during shore leave, even though you know he has no where else to go, makes for a better story than firing your doctor because he's slightly less competant than another one that comes along. For that matter, if the officer could pitch him/herself to you in a conversation, it would start things off better than simply saying He's a doctor. He's cured slightly more patients than he's killed. He helps with hearts and irons.","July 6, 2014","false","5.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

The art is quite interesting and well done, that game has no bugs and flows rather smooth for a game in development.\n\nThe game is interesting yet not quite. In the early game if you are not sure how to make money you'll be struggling along to get enough to keep your ship at sea (or zee as the call it). Adding to that is the monotony of traveling back and forth time and again like an errand boy.\n\nTrading is there but the income is paltry; the profits a meer pitance. A life of piracy is also not an option for the early game as most ships (except other pirates) can obliterate your ship is if it were a flea. However the AI is rather simple, so once you figure out how to get an enemy stuck on an island then its easy tedious pickings (1000hp baddy will take you awhile if your guns only do 20hp).\n\nAll assuming your crew doesn't mutiny from fear.\n\nThat's an interesting mechanic in the game. Fear. As you travel in this sunless sea you accumulate fear, once it maxes out your crew will mutiny. Apparently, although you can't travel to the surface because it'll kill you, traveling the zee will make you go mad to. You have to wonder how this underground society even functions.","December 21, 2014","false","20.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

You're a captain on a ship in an underground sea. You start out with some supplies and fuel and go out on little text-based quests. The world is pretty brutal - you've probably heard that you'll fail a lot. That's true. The quests seem varied enough.\nMy primary beef with this game is how incoherent the interfaces/interactions are at the ports. You get a sense of what you're supposed to do, but the interactions are not intuitive. Also, you get no information about what the rewards are going to be for different quests, so you don't know how to prioritize. Some quests are locked and list requirements to unlock them, but the requirements are really hard to understand sometimes. The main interaction interface, too, is kind of clunky and unclear. The worst is probably the journal. I was scratching my head a lot trying to figure out what the heck some of the different items meant. If you play it, you'll see what I mean.\nThis game is supposed to be officially released, now, but there are still bugs here and there. Pictures crowd out text, ships will occasionally jump from location to location.\nAll in all, the game feels unfinished and could benefit from a hefty amount of user feedback.\nDefinitely not worth $20 right now. Maybe when they figure out how to make it a little more user friendly.\n","February 7, 2015","false","3.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The writing is very off the wall and made me laugh out loud on several occasions. Admittedly, it's my favorite part of the game.  The combat is pretty simple to which I'm thankful, mainly because I had my hands full trying to understand the lore and keep track of the resources/stats in the game and what they did (mirrors, hearts, fragments, etc.).  "Sunless Sea" is packed full of content...the playtime on one play-through alone is at LEAST a few hours, probably much more assuming you don't get killed early on.

The game world is mysterious and eerie, but the actual game itself is unbearably bland and unpalatable. Your steam powered ship slogs across the (rather small) (semi-)procedurally generated map to interesting-looking locations that have no interactivity or gameplay payoff. The gameplay (if you can call it that) instead consists of micromanaging fuel, supplies and terror to visit these non-interactive regions for no real reason other than to wipe the fog of war off the map. Along the way, random events happen, or don't happen, enemies (ranging from trivial to overpowered depending on how much gold you've grinded to upgrade your ship) may hamper your path, and once you get there, you are treated to massive volumes of poorly-written text with the engagement and payoff of unravelling a wet sock to find a dead mouse inside.\n\nGive this a miss.","October 31, 2015","false","3.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","2"

The hunger bar suggests you could make your crew starve a little harder before eating, but I never found out how.\n\nProbably run into a pack of rocket-propelled jellyfish which hate boats for some reason and even if you manage to dodge their charge attack, they'll slow down to home in on your boat and do full damage upon touching you no matter how slow they had been going at that point. Between that and the charge time on your cannon you're guaranteed to lose like a third of your HP, but you can use its carcass to feed your crew!

Detailed backstory; creative stories presented as text-adventures; forbidding, dangerous environment; loads of continually-updating content; dark, beautiful atmosphere; original rather than cliched. Unfortunately, gameplay is dominated by moving your boat long distances over empty expanses that take long times to transverse. Due to limited resources, the game forces you to grind (ie doing port reports at the same ports each trip  you take, or ferrying items to and fro) as the safest path. Combat is never worth while, but easy to avoid. Why even include it if it's always a bad deal?","May 1","false","15.4"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","1"

It turns out, most interesting locations can't be interacted with in any way, so the long boring sail it took to get to them feels wasted.  Once you know a successful trade route, you learn to exploit that and use it to start your voyage each time.  This gets repetitve and boring so quickly, I had to uninstall it.\n\nI really wanted to like this game, as the aesthetics are amazing, and the writing is witty, but the game itself is a massive waste of my time.

I've played Fallen London a fair bit and I guess that's why I decided to give this a try on a whim.\n\nThough Early Access (which I tend to despise), the game is incredibly polished and VERY playable.  I haven't really even encountered any bugs (although a fair bit of content is missing).\n\nThe game contains an interesting mix of story-telling and roguelike elements.  It is difficult but with a little care you can always progress... a little... even if you die an awful death.  I found the learning curve to be a little steep but with a few hours of dedication I figured out how to make a little money and at least keep the crew fed and fuel in the tank.\n\nThe only real aspect I think might deter some gamers is the difficulty, which I personally think is what makes the game great.  I spend a lot of time making small decisions because they really do matter.  Loot the ship I destroyed?  Or send two sailors to TRY and get it back to port to sell?  Can I even TRUST two sailors?\n\nIt's really, really great AND it links up with your Fallen London account to add some nifty stories to both games.\n\nI definitely think you should buy it : ).","July 7, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

While the game still has a lot left to develop, after exploring most of what they've created I am really looking forward to the rest. While I might not recommend it at the moment for casual gamers looking for a longterm game - only because of its alpha status - I have no doubt that once it is completed it will be a lot of fun. Here's a run down on the game so far:\n\nStory: Strategy exploration game set on an ocean. The location is a steampunk era london which has fallen far underground, located on a vast ocean called "the zee," populated by monsters, pirates, and even other sentients.  As a captain you have to manage several aspects of your ship, including rations, fuel, weaponry, crew and a unique status, fear, which rises the longer you are out in the dark ocean, or when encountering Lovecraftian monsters. You "win" by exploring various strongholds and calculating the most profitable trade routes, all while discovering hidden secrets and legends.\n\nMechanics: Far from easy, this is a really tough, tough game. Managing all of the aforementioned stats can get overwhelming and your first few tries as a captain will without a doubt leave you either at the bottom of the ocean, eaten, starved, or murdered. You aquire officers as the game progresses who in turn provide stat boosts, the stats being:\nheart: medic ability plus ability to aspire and convince\nveils: ability to hide and misdirect\npages: ability to find truths and knowledge\nmirrors: ability to detect enemies\niron: ability to inflict damageThe combat is turn based, and as such can be paused at any time.\n\nAesthetics: This game looks and feels very, very, very cool. All the art isn't there yet, as well as lots of locations, but man does it look cool.\n\nMy Hiccups: (hopefully will be addressed) Sometimes I select the wrong option (spurn the gods? why would I choose that?) because the menu button for "next" is precariously located over another option's "yes!" button in the drop down. This has happened a few times and hopefully it will get looked at. An open market would be nice too, because as it stands there are extremely limited ways to earn money via trade routes. Ship speed is also just too slow; this might be to make the ocean more vast, but it just seems grinding when trying to make a long haul.\n\nshould you buy this game? If you don't mind playing an in-development game, then yes. If you like ocean themed adventure, then yes. If you like strategy RPG's with strong elements of survival, then yes. If you don't like waiting or supporting a game during its development, then no.\n\nOverall, excluding the factors relating to it still being developed, I would easily rate this as a 9/10. Support the designers and in return they'll hopefully love you back","July 7, 2014","true","19.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

In a boat? With a terrified crew? And I can eat that same crew if I get hungry?? Sign me up!!\nBut be prepared. You're going to die. A lot. And that's okay. You get to preserve a bit of what you got from each death, so in a sense, it less of a death and more of a restart. The greenish tint to everything is much more tastefully done than Deus Ex: Human Revolution's yellow tint to everything, in my opinion. But onto the important thing!\n\nDo I recommend Sunless Sea? Well, yes and no.\n\nIt's going to be a great game one day. Right now it's just good. Mostly because it needs two things:\n\n1) Balancing. A lot of balancing. You start the game with very few Echos (your currency) and the rate at which you can earn Echos is far, far too slow. It would take DAYS to make the amount of money to afford just one upgrade to your ship. (Hint: those are important) The other thing that needs balancing is the rate at which your Terror falls and drops. If you're just a little off the coast, your terror skyrockets so incredibly fast, it almost discourages exploration. And when you make port, anything you can do costs so much and reduces so little terror, that it's nearly impossible to reduce it. I understand that there's supposed to be an element of difficulty to all of this, but grinding for miniscule amounts of money while freaking your crew out to the brink of madness just really isn't worth it.\n2) The fun factor. Honestly, the exploration part of Sunless Sea is quite fun. Finding new islands, getting eaten by giant crabs, and being blown to smithereens by privateers and the like is all well and good, but the combat system especially needs an overhaul. It has an FTL-like pausable strategy element to it, but not nearly to the same quality of FTL. If you're fighting an enemy ship, you can't aim for certain parts of the ship. If you're fighting a giant crab or an eel or a squid, you can't aim for the eyes to blind it. It's just different "moves" you can do like evade or attack that take time to warm up.\n\nBasically, if you want to get this game to try it out, it's worth it. But if you wait, it'll be even better.","July 8, 2014","true","2.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

That said, I love this game. It's so atmospheric, simply in how it reads and how it moves and just how you feel.\n\nTHERE IS A LOT OF READING.\n\nThis is very heavy on reading, and for someone like me, who could play visual novels all day, that's fine. In fact, it's awesome! But I want to get that out there for those people who can't stand reading.\n\nEarning Echo's (money) is REALLY REALLY HARD and takes time and planning. You have to know what you're doing... That, or I just haven't found the right method yet, aside from risking life and crew to capture prize vessels. Nothing pays like pirates.\n\nThe game implements some Lovecraftian horror in the most beautiful way. It's also very Steampunk, but not in the way that Steampunk has forcefully become today- meaning, brown, gears, and steam everywhere. That's literally Steampunk in a nutshell, which, if done well (I'm thinking of you, Guns of Icarus), isn't a bad thing. This game takes the concept of Steampunk0 meaning ideology, mannerisms, and presence and implements it in that way. It is Victorian London, or what's left of it, sitting in death incarnate. It is a world of darkness, filled with gods and things that you can't fully comprehend, nor will you truly ever. It is dank, it is difficult, and you will go mad. Your crew will want to mutiny, and you will have to try and get more... Or risk trying to lower their fear. It is a time when steam was the only mode of power, because it was all London could afford to get, being derelict, rotten, and nearly eaten alive. That you are alive at all has become a near miracle, and that's no mistake. Monsters in this game can be some of the most terrifying things in the world if you go too far from home, and I can't tell you how many times I've had to run screaming from some kind of horrific island turtle that looks like it's made of things no respectable turtle should be made of. Not to mention being attacked by my nightmares. NOT COOL, YO.\n\nIn all seriousness, I love the game, and the updates have all been really helpful. I hope for a little more story and a little more meat, like more pasts, but otherwise, it's fantastic, as is its prequel game Fallen London.\n\nVery different compared to many of the other things out there...

The nice layd back way of enjoy this slow pace game has been ruined with the new action based combat. This was and is not an action game. Very disapointing! This game had so much potential. It's a shame the Devs listened to the action freaks, who don't understand this type of game at all and changed the combat.\n\nIf the combat doesn't change into somehting more turnbased and more relaxing the way it was before, then that's it for me in Sunless Sea.\n\nNot Recommended\n\n\nEdit after playing with the new combat system 18NOV2014:\nI think the game is still good, although I do not like the new combat system, which is very action based now. It does not fit into the game as the old combat system did. I know, there were players complaining with the old combat system, but I think they made it worse and not better.\nA complete tuenbased combat would be very suitable for this game. Since it is still in Alpha, I am hoping they will change the combat system again to a more enjoyable experience.\n\n\nFirst review:\nI just bought the game last night and even though it was already late, I spent more than two hours playing, before I was to tired to go on.\nFantastic atmosphere and sounds and overall fantastic game!!! . . . In the two hours I have learned a lot about how to make money and keep the terror down. I have seen some posts, where people are complaining about the game was to hard . . . that's not the case, you have to try different things and understand the combat, then it works out fine.\nThis is not an easy to learn game, but if you read more carefully and try to understand how things work (all in all it is a weird scenario) then the rewards of having success are great.\nI will play some more and give further feedback later . . .\n\nI am glad that through STEAM Early Access we are getting more and more good and unussual stuff to play!!!\nSome EA games have not been working out and failed in the end, but this one is great and will not dissapoint you. Can't wait for the full version to come out.\n\nEdit after playing 6 hours:\nThis game is addictive! Fantastic stories to discover, great fights and so much fun to enter uncharted waters!\nWhat I really like about the game is, that you can pause at any time and plan what you want to do next. I find the game well balanced and if you don't do anything stupid you can really discover so many different things in the game world. Off course acting unpatient and wondering around in waters you are not set up for (weapons, fuel . . .etc) you will not survive long and eventually die.\n\nI can't wait to discover more stories and places to go to.  . . . :-)","July 6, 2014","false","17.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I bought it upon a recommendation from a friend (don't worry, we're still friends) while simultaneously trying out the related browser based game "Fallen London". The gameplay looked kinda neat and relaxed, which was what I wanted at the time, and I liked the look of the graphics.\n\nWhile I can't complain about the graphics, it's the gameplay that turns me off. While you are captaining a ship, this navigation aspect of the game is secondary to the text based gameplay which the game mainly consist of. There's tons of reading, and if you're the kind of guy that's used to quickly skim through texts while playing you shouldn't buy this game. I mean it, only buy this game if you got book worm tendencies (nothing negative about it) and this wonky kind of steampunk universe is appealing to you.\n\nSure, there's some fighting sea monsters going on, but that part is so simplified that it's just something you need to get over with. You need to manage your fuel/supply economy while navigating the sea but that's about it and it's just not very fun. Simply put, the game lacks complexity apart from the text based stories.\n\nMy recommendation is to try out fallen London first (it's free, google it), and if you like that type of game then you might wanna try out sunless sea. If you're like me however, and abadon your fallen london account after two days, then this game is a waste of your money.","February 25, 2015","false","4.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

Sadly it lacks in the execution in a lot of different ways. Pacing can be frustratingly slow for long voyages. Game mechanisms are obfuscated or unclear, interface is cluttered with all kinds of "quality" and "value" statements that look like they belong strictly on the back-end and not in the user-facing area. Quests and objectives are very poorly organized and unclear. Ultimately felt buggy, unfinished, unpolished.\nAfter playing for a few days trying a bunch of different things, I'm giving up mostly because of how slow the pacing can be at some parts (literally, I was reading a book while sailing the boat in a straight line across the ocean), because of the difficulties with objective tracking, and finally because after working hard to get the Scion legacy in place, I lost it because I had a full boat as I sailed into one part, thus angering a god and bringing his wrath upon my family on my return to London, removing the Scion perk for the next play-through. I get that dying is part of the game, but wrecking the the legacy perks that are supposed to make re-play more enjoyable on such a ridiculous arbitrary point was the nail in the coffin for me.\n\nTL;DR: It's still a buggy beta-build/early access game, regardless of what they've said about release dates.

The nice layd back way of enjoy this slow pace game has been ruined with the new action based combat. This was and is not an action game. Very disapointing! This game had so much potential. It's a shame the Devs listened to the action freaks, who don't understand this type of game at all and changed the combat.\n\nIf the combat doesn't change into somehting more turnbased and more relaxing the way it was before, then that's it for me in Sunless Sea.\n\nNot Recommended\n\n\nEdit after playing with the new combat system 18NOV2014:\nI think the game is still good, although I do not like the new combat system, which is very action based now. It does not fit into the game as the old combat system did. I know, there were players complaining with the old combat system, but I think they made it worse and not better.\nA complete tuenbased combat would be very suitable for this game. Since it is still in Alpha, I am hoping they will change the combat system again to a more enjoyable experience.\n\n\nFirst review:\nI just bought the game last night and even though it was already late, I spent more than two hours playing, before I was to tired to go on.\nFantastic atmosphere and sounds and overall fantastic game!!! . . . In the two hours I have learned a lot about how to make money and keep the terror down. I have seen some posts, where people are complaining about the game was to hard . . . that's not the case, you have to try different things and understand the combat, then it works out fine.\nThis is not an easy to learn game, but if you read more carefully and try to understand how things work (all in all it is a weird scenario) then the rewards of having success are great.\nI will play some more and give further feedback later . . .\n\nI am glad that through STEAM Early Access we are getting more and more good and unussual stuff to play!!!\nSome EA games have not been working out and failed in the end, but this one is great and will not dissapoint you. Can't wait for the full version to come out.\n\nEdit after playing 6 hours:\nThis game is addictive! Fantastic stories to discover, great fights and so much fun to enter uncharted waters!\nWhat I really like about the game is, that you can pause at any time and plan what you want to do next. I find the game well balanced and if you don't do anything stupid you can really discover so many different things in the game world. Off course acting unpatient and wondering around in waters you are not set up for (weapons, fuel . . .etc) you will not survive long and eventually die.\n\nI can't wait to discover more stories and places to go to.  . . . :-)","July 6, 2014","false","17.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

If the game's trading system was a little more fleshed out it might make things more enjoyable, but the trading aspect of this game is so poorly done that the only way to trade for the money needed to actually play the game and explore requires abusing limited storyline events.\n\nI got very bored very fast with this game, and this is comming from someone who likes story driven or rogue-lite games.","February 11","false","17.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And when you do, you still have to visit the same towns, do the same grind to get to the endgame, and go through all the same hoops, meaning death is just a waste of your time when you can reload your save and not deal with it in the first place. What the hell. Really?\n\nThis game has many good qualities, which is why it's so disappointing that the rest of it gets kinda bad. With a 2x speed option and actually letting you listen to the music in towns, this would be MUCH better. Endless Sky is a free exploration game set in space that has many similarities and feels like a far more solid game than Sunless Sea IMHO.

Generally, the only way to acquire these goods is with Echoes. How do you get Echoes? Not easily, that's for sure.\n\nYou are encouraged to 'explore' through tooltips as that's the most reliable way to get money. Discovering a new area generates a Port Report which you can turn in to your home base. But you can only do this a limited number of times and then what? Port Reports barely cover your expenses, so all you traveling nets you a partly explored map, but no more Echoes than what you started with. It is disheartening to spend 2 hours sailing around, returning home, and finding out you have less money, health, and supplies than when you started with no advancement in your character.\n\nI checked some guides to find out if I was missing out on a game mechanic. Nope. Most getting started guides involve bee-lining to some very specific places, followed by trading goods between ports for paltry sums. The most absurd strategy involves killing off your captain immediately to pass on your starting gold to your next captain. This is not good game design.\n\nIf I was at least rewarded with interesting stories or encounters it might not be so bad, but Sunless is a 100% text based game. It aims for a Lovecraftian flair but comes off pretentious and plodding as you wade through paragraphs of text.\n\nI wanted a game where exploring was rewarded. While it is constantly encouraged through tooltips, you are generally punishd for it.

I aided an archaeologist who sold her soul to a monkey in exchange for digging equipment. I removed many of the internal organs of one of my crewmates, which he thanked me for.

Unforgiving and with a solid daunting grind presented to you every time you die.\n\nI've died twice now. On my second go I lasted quite a long time and when my crew started a mutiny from insanity/fear we all died in a battle amongst ourselves. That sounds great and all, but the reality was I now had to start over and from all that stuff I did in my 2nd attempt none of it mattered and none of it was brought over to my 3rd attempt.\n\nAll that work, all that traveling trying to survive and figure out the story. None of it mattered I had a kid, but now nothing and I just have to start over from scratch.\n\nIt just doesn't feel rewarding and don't get me wrong the writing is good, but when the climb for success is so steep with so many potential pitfalls it kind of seems too daunting of a task.\n\nLove the game wish there was a better way to feel like you were making progress without having to switch it to save mode "merciful mode?". I wanted to keep my medal thing too so I didn't switch it to merciful mode but clearly I didn't get far enough for it to have a use so I guess I should have switched it to merciful mode anyways? I dunno this game could be so much more....","February 10, 2015","false","17.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I aided an archaeologist who sold her soul to a monkey in exchange for digging equipment. I removed many of the internal organs of one of my crewmates, which he thanked me for.

It's not the same kind of grind you would get in a dungeon delving roguelike where you gradually get stronger so that you can delve deeper. It's the kind of grind where you have to do the same trade routes repeatedly with no variation just so you can save up for a slightly bigger/faster/better ship to do it all again.\n\nRepetition is the heart of a roguelike, learning the systems and going at them again and again, but a good one will pepper each life with something interesting and new; and this is where Sunless Sea fails to hit the spot. There's just not enough there at the start to justify getting to the end.\n\nIt's worth buying at a sub $10 price, but it won't be a game that endears itself for years to come.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/BarryCop/recommended/304650/","BarryCop","Fion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/BarryCop/","593 products in account","A spectacular game of daring sea captains who you control one after another, getting swallowed up by the sea. One gets killed by Pirates while another gets killed by a giant shark. Another gets killed by cannibals while the next one dies from an engine blast. Then the next one commits suicide. While the next sacrifices his whole crew to a sea god to heal himself to just get eaten up by a giant sea-crab.\n\nMy first ever captain was a philosopher wanting to write a book about the sea under the earth. Gets trapped next to an island from using all the fuel they could find on the steamer and then end up eating all their food. Suddenly a ship appears and we go full cannons on it to be fired back on and sunk in an instant not knowing it was a bunch of pirates and their ship was bigger and better....\n\nNext captain was a veteran from the old war and made a crew of sturdy men and woman. Not to mention the first mate of the last ship made it back to London and signed back on. Off we went and were doing a good job when all of a sudden fuel was running low. Using all the supplies we had we ended up getting stranded right outside the port of London. No one helped us. We were hungry. And the captain pleaded for anyone to help us even the seas gods themselves who he didn't believe in. All of a sudden the ship vanishes and appears far off to nowhere at a castle of a tentacle god. Tentacles reaching out of the castle the crew goes nuts crazy and the captain starts pushing off his own crew into the sea trying to sacrifice them to the creature. Maybe it will give them fuel or food. Anything to get away. The captain starts stabbing himself and killing his fellow crew to the last man but the tentacle giant barely did anything. Just watched as they killed themselves off one by one and the captain dies of his own wounds. Everyone is now dead. No one hears from them again.\n\nThe next captain does an amazing job even though he used to be a poet. He gets a house, a wife, a child. Lots of money! Lots of good working crew! Lots of rat people who become his best friends and help work on the ship! Everythings going great! Hes honest and does his contracts, his deliveries, and helps people when he can! And this is the captain I am at right now and hes been alive for over one year in game and most of his crew intact.\n\nThe best part? I'm on the hardest difficulty. No saving. No reloading. Every choice you make is final. Which what the game should be! But thats just me! It makes you stand on edge and everything you do has the biggest impact you can think of. Not to mention the game is freaky as hell and actually is scary. The monsters in this game..... Are huge and this game is about surviving the sea not a shootem up RPG. You will get screwed up and your people will die. Your ship will get sunk and you have to live with it because you shouldn't of called that giant creature with bait that you threw over board. It was all your fault sir. All your fault! Oh and timmy jumped overboard and got eaten by that thing. He said he was home? I think he went crazy captain...\n\nEverything you do impacts what happens even with your next captain. They have to live with what the last captain did. Everything you do changes the sea, the people, everything. Its up to you what happens and what you do with your crew.","April 1, 2015","true","34.2"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Really anyone, who likes the idea of being a captain of a ship in the middle of an unexplored, dark, and foggy sea  would be cool, should play this game.\n\nThat said, it's not a game that can keep one excited for very long.  First off, the game world is designed to be dreary - but there is only so much dreariness someone can take before they have to go one to something else.  More importantly though, as others have pointed out, after the first few hours of exploring and learning what your limits are - the game becomes a dreary grindfest.\n\nWhat could be changed about the game to make it more engaging?  It's been a while since I played - but my memory tells me that it was having to repeatedly go to the same places over and over again, simply to collect fuel and supplies or money to buy them, that really made the game feel like it dragged on.  If things changed every time you arrived at a location, that would make it much more interesting to go back there.","April 14, 2015","true","24.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

How many hours have I wasted wandering from shore to shore, hauling rocks for a living?\n\nThis is a newer review, hence I would like to note early that the timed based system is now replaced with a real time attack system where most of it is sitting staring at the enemy and waiting for your cannons to equip. I would personally have prefered to have my cannons loaded and ready for fire, but such is the world of Sunless Sea. The game is very close to a horror game of a lonely little captain and the crew adriff in a vast and unforgiving ocean surrounded by monsters and being driven insane by the fact that even the very crewmate that mans the ships could simply be waiting for the right moment to rip off your face and assume your position as captain as the thing that now lives inside of your skin slowly chew away at your trusted officiers.\n\nI recomended this game out of personal enjoyment, but I feel it also necessary to warn you about the game. The nitpicks I have with the game is simple: the game has nearly no link between narrative and gameplay.\n\nWhat I mean by this is simple: you start off the game with what might as well be a bamboo raft for all the monsters and enemy ships in the game care. The world of Sunless Sea is beautifully rich in narrative, but following any threads of narratives is nearly impossible between trying not to be sunk by a brigade of crabs and trying to keep track of which islands have to be visited next, to the point where I arrive at islands at the end of the world having completely forgotten not only the story, but also what I wanted to do to get there in the first place.\n\nThe world is expansive, the atmosphere is lovely, and the music can swing anywhere from the energetic sounds of cutlass clashing atop a ship's deck to the ballard with a lovely countess in a ballgown to the raspy and bonechilling sounds that seem to rake over your very bones. All of this is lost, however, because the narrative does not reward you nearly as much as menial tasks. I made more from a single trip of hauling stones than three journeys right across the edge of the world and all I did was run across a few pirates which were barely a challenge. Trying to pursue narrative in this game is like showing up to an attack dog show with strips of bacon tied to your scrotum to get 500 bucks of betting money from your best pal. Bold, yes, and even exciting, but it will quickly turn humiliating, unbearably painful, and at the end of it all you will only be missing something important. After the second week sitting in the hospital bed you'll start to wonder whether or not the 500 bucks and the hospital bill that your insurance company refuses to pay out was worth it all when you could make about the same amount after about a week of hard work without all of the "peeing out of a tube for the rest of your miserable life" business. And that is the same thing I felt after about my 5th death and retry. Oh, didn't I mention that before? If you ever happen to die anywhere in your journey of EXPLORING THE ENTIRE WORLD FULL OF THINGS THAT WANT YOU DEAD the game expects you to start over from the beginning. I'm not talking save scumming, I'm talking losing 5 hours of playtime because you miscalculated the amount of fuel you'll need because you didn't want the game dancing on top of your hold calling you a loser.\n\nEven after all of the rock hauling at which point I bought the largest and strongest ship in the game, the game still insisted on being annoying! After I got a boat that didn't cave into its own weight because it can't outrun a crab, the whole survival horror aspect of the game vanished because the new boat I got could ram into a living iceburg around fifty times without sinking and after it all, the one that would be ripped to shreads, broken into two, and sunk to the bottom of the cold sea would be the iceburg and not me! The cold lonelyness vanished because even the bloodless roars of all of all of the sea monsters could not make me feel fear when I'm sitting behind an arsenal that could singlehandedly sink the entire British navy and the entirety of Britain along with it!\n\nSo you may be wondering why, despite all of my compalints, I am still recomending this game. It's quite simply because its a damn good game!\n\nThe narrative, though poorly implemented, is beautifully savory. The game is beautiful as I have said and shall continue to repeat. This game is simply a gem that the souless tripple A gaming industry has become after pumping the thriteen thousanth brownish FPS shooter out of a cootch that is so overused and dried that it could be replaced by a mound of sand from the Saharan desert and, and let's be fair here, it will probably still feel fresher! Sunless sea may not have started in a good place, but I could not see a place where corners have been cut. It is a game that shows that the creators poured their sweat and heart into making their creation as good as can be even when it would have been cheaper to have gone half way and none of us would be wiser. Its clunky mechanics and ricketty conceptualization may be far from a flawless ore, but the effort and time that must have went into polishing it from there has made this game shine brighter in my eyes than any overpriced military game that has come out of the tripple A in the recent years. And for that, I'll say that they deserve your attention.","December 5, 2014","true","33.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
