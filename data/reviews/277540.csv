On the plus side, there are many options to make the user interface easy to work with at the expense of making the puzzles a bit easier.\n\nOverall , its hard to recommend this to casual players because there are better examples of the genre worth looking into and experienced adventure gamers will find the story and puzzles obtuse and difficult to care about.","February 20, 2014","false","2.5"," 65 of 72 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","65","72","0","1"

Finished it in two hours without problems. Click a bit around, find all items in the scene, try to combine items or use them. Next puzzle.\n\nSecondly and more important: The story is very poor, the dialogs are cheesy and the ending not satisfying. There is no mystery to solve, no story to uncover. Games like this need a story that drags you in. I wandered through the game and always wondered, why I am doing this or that.\n\nWithout a good story it is just a series of short, not very interesing puzzles. There are better implementations of this kind of games out there, played one just last week. An undead pirate had captured my daughter and I had to free her. The hunt for the daughter was the driving force and motivation, the history of the pirate a mystery to uncover.","February 22, 2014","false","2.9"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","28","34","0","0"

It's strange and disjointed and has wonky dialogue.\n\nAnd I'm recommending it.\n\nIt's short, which is a saving grace in my book. These types of games often suffer from difficult puzzles with unclear objectives, but Tales from the Dragon Mountain: The Strix does an excellent job of guiding you from place to place. If you are ever unable to find an item in the background, a generous hint system will help you locate it so you can move on. The storyline is interesting and bizarre, and the sheer weirdness will likely keep you moving forward to see the next oddity.\n\nEasily beaten in 2-3 hours, it won't take up much of your time. Considering how few games of this type have made it to Steam, it's nice to have another diversion. Just don't expect the next GOTY.","March 15, 2014","true","2.5"," 17 of 19 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","17","19","0","0"

Very simple 3D room renders that sometimes forget the sense of scale, really mediocre voice acting, weak story and the overall jankiness leave much to be desired here.\n\nThere are plenty of other great Hidden object games on Steam, for example, the games by Artifex Mundi, which are all good, or by Gogii Games, which are mostly good. Try those instead.","October 11, 2014","false","0.7"," 19 of 27 people (70%) found this review helpful","70","19","27","0","1"

Also, the game is trying to look story-driven but the truth is that you don't get any info on the characters and locations that are introduced and the ending is a bit of an anticlimax.So you can easily leave with an unsatisfied feeling if you played it merely for the story and wanted to know more about the story/magic/world/etc...\n\nDespite these things I really enjoyed playing it. It was like reading a book in which the author had a lot of good ideas but didn't work them out properly: it stills feeds the imagination of the reader and it's fun until you reach the ending. So even though the ending was dissapointing, that doesn't mean it ruins the game because I had fun playing it. I got through the game without pauses and I was amused with the dialogs and the puzzles.\nI bought it as part of a bundle, so I think the price I paid was right, but I don't recommend it for the full price.","April 15, 2014","true","2.8"," 10 of 12 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","10","12","0","0"

I finished it in a couple hours. People less used to this style of game may take longer.\nWorked with the stylus on the Windows Surface Pro 3. :D (other point and click games failed this category)\nVoice acting is amusing too.\nLots of good options in the menu like turning the music, voice and sound effects down seperately.

I found also the game really short and without a lot of minigames, though these ones are for once really easy. You don't have to battle for "hours" to solve them without passing. The voice acting is good in my opinion. Too bad there is no achievement to show on Steam but only in-game, I would have loved to show that I unlocked the sparkles ones (perhaps easy after finding how you need to do). Anyway, there are better HOG games out there (I think about Artifex Mundi or Mumbo Jumbo products) but it was still a nice ride, mainly for beginners (unless going for Adventure mode directly).","December 22, 2014","true","3.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tridons/recommended/277540/","tridons","Tridon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tridons/","2941 products in account","This game almost got a recommendation from me, however it falls short due to two important things. The first is the story. It kind of works, but it is too simple and short to give the player any value other than to just force feed us the next puzzle or area. The other big shortcomming is the voice acting, and this problem really ehances the weakness that the story is to the game. Having few voice actors in a game is not necessarily something to make a big fuzz about in a budget title, but this game would have gained more from only written dialoge rather than the addition of these voice actors.  It might be that the game is targeting children and that a child of about 10-12 would enjoy this more, but for me it was simply so detrimental that it just dragged the experience enough down to miss the recommendation.\n\nThe puzzles are somewhat enjoyable and the grapichs and aestethics are serviceable. The mechanic I enjoyed the most was the ability to tweak the difficulty in the options to fit your playstyle and patience. I also encountered a bug when trying to click object. Just some small glitches that made is a little cumbersome to click and choose the objects you want to. Fixing this would have given the game just that little extra feel of polish.\n\nNot recommended, but close nonetheless. One of the better non-recommended games for my taste.","February 8, 2015","false","3.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"
