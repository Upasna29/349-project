Couldn't have been more disappointed. The overall flow is very reminiscient of, say, Dragon Pass, but all the decisions have been reworked to punish the player for everything; as a result, everything feels bad and the game ends in a consistiently boring fashion of "sorrie, you ran out of a thing." Combined with heavy RNG influence, the game takes a winning formula and in an attempt to make it feel threatening, scary, 'hardcore,' makes it instead profoundly tedious and almost comedic where all decisions are either pointless, or bad.\n\nNo, seriously. Here's an example of a situation; you need power, obviously. There's one reactor module which is leaking in a very obvious way near the wreck and forces the cast to evacuate. Cool. However, you can scavenge for a randomized amount of days to find another one! Which is also leaking, something you only discover after you bring it back, which decreases your health. Or you can opt to not have one, in which case all your colony basically doesn't work (lacking a reactor is something like a 70% power loss.)\n\nA more comedic example is when the doctor brings you aside to suggest harvesting unripe crops to produce food faster. The effect, he tells you, will be overall harm to the colony's health. However, you also produce more food. For consideration, here's what lacking food does; it lowers the colony's health (because you have to cut back on rations.)\n\nYour choice, captain: Option A, or Option A with a different name?\n\nAlso, the way the resources in this game work are laughable. At the beginning of the game you find a Hydroponics module which you are told is 'in good condition.' To install it at your base, you require 8 "Resources," implied to be a combination of raw materials, parts et. al. For consideration, your truck can at most carry maybe 6 resources a day, and that's only in the first week of the game when the harvesting is good.\n\nTo install this mostly undamaged, prefabbed device, it requires more than a single cargo truck's worth of Additional Bits. The future of space colonization is IKEA; our 'prefabs' are actually just DIY kits and somehow we never have enough of those wooden dowels!\n\nTo put it in a different, equally bizarre light; after the first week, week-and-a-half, I was getting only half the resources in salvage from the ship. Assuming that keeps up it'll probably peter out to nothing in 3-4 weeks. So it takes a quarter of a gigantic 1500 person colony ship to put together this "intact" module.\n\nThe game suffers from other oddities (your least valuable resource: human beings. seriously, actual people do nothing, you cannot organize foot-based scavenging parties as anything but a destructive last-ditch effort in emergencies. they are nothing but a lose condition as far as I could tell.)\n\nMore than anything the sheer effort put in to making sure there is no possible reprieve, no chance for the player to get their footing and feel like they know what they're doing requires the game to twist over and backwards making the world ridiculous, not grim. Furthermore, it ruins the pacing of the game, making it feel stressful, not fearful, tedious, not exciting. I wish I could even say it's as terrible as being in this situation would be in real life, but it's too over the top to feel that, even.\n\nFor what it's worth, the actual writing is quite good; the characters do a good job of making the player feel the situation even if the gameplay doesn't, and the setting is interesting. I would care about the mystery, the politics, the little dramas of their lives, if not for all this video-game. I sincerely hope they put together a patch or something to pull back on the turn-it-to-11 nature of the difficulty, because I even think there might be a good game in there. I just think it's been buried.\n\nI really wish I could say otherwise, but I don't recommend this. Maybe later patches will shift the balance to be less overwhelming.","March 8","false","1.0"," 107 of 123 people (87%) found this review helpful 11 people found this review funny","87","107","123","11","6"

I like how challengin it is early on and how careful you have to be in how you manage your colony. And the story is very interesting, unfortunately you have basically no say in how it really unfolds.\n\nI didn't think this was the case at first. Many of the descisions you make clearly effect things like morale, the health of your colony, and so on. But for me part of the fun of a game like this is seeing what happens when you go back and make different choices. My first game I lost pretty early on. The second time, I make it to the end and won. So I went back to play a third game, to see what paths the different choices led me down. And this is where the game let me down.\n\nAs a heads up there are some spoilers for the early game here.\n\nOne of the early decisions in the game is wether or not to risk getting a reactor, which you need to power your base, but is damaged and leaking radiation. Having won the game once, I wanted to challenge myself, and see how long I could keep the base going without getting the reactor. I was enjoying the challange, until a story event happened. An explosion in the reactor I didn't have. The worse part is the mechanic of the game was clearly going to force me to either go get the reactor, or loose. But having a scripted event happen, that didn't reflect the current state of my base. And suddenly it was no longer fun.\n\nAll the decision I had made on my first play through no longer felt like they mattered. The game presents you with several moral choices, ask you to decide wether you will turn your security force into a secret police that crushes any dissent, or try and retain a semblance of law and order. And although you often see your choices reflected in the systems of the game, the moral level for instance, if it's not reflected in the actual story you are told, what's the point?\n\nThe characters are intereseting, and the early game seems to promise the chance to learn more about them. When I won the first time I assumed that I had just missed opportunities to learn more about their past, and to trigger other story lines. Maybe I did, maybe I didn't. But I can't say I'm interested in going back anymore because now I'm spending lots of time clicking through lots of text I've already read, in hopes of find another story line.\n\nIt's a wordy game, and that's not a bad thing. But if you're going to ask your player to read that much and offer all these choices, then they need to be able to effect the narative. Otherwise, you should just make a graphic novel, and not bother trying to make it a game.","March 8","false","4.3"," 52 of 60 people (87%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","87","52","60","2","2"

But after a while you start to notice that how well you do in the management/base building section doesn't really affect the story.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/hanzeduh/recommended/427860/","hanzeduh","Duh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/hanzeduh/","189 products in account","Hey folks, i would like to give you my impressions as an official tester of the game and hope you will find it helpful or at least interesting.\n\nThe Next World is a pretty unique blend of strategy, management and story-telling. It is inspired by titles like King of Dragon Pass, but manages to create its own particular flavor. A largely linear story-line (albeit with various endings) is combined with random events and colony management. So while the overall direction is not procedurally generated, the path that you walk varies based on your careful planning, the incidents you encounter and your decisions on how to handle them.\n\nThe game is text-heavy, but the writing is good and conveys an engaging story. Combined with the dire situation you find yourself in, the scarce ressources, dying colonists, and a continous flow of new challenges, i felt compelled to read everything and found the experience to be fun, tense, engaging and varied.\n\nTo me the most exciting period in TNW is the struggle through the early game. It really feels like a dreadful situation, where every ray of hope also casts new shadows. Once you manage to get through that you will have some time to explore, upgrade and expand (you do this throughout the game, but the focus in early game is on using anything and everything to address basic needs), though it is just the calm before the final storm, which should best be used to prepare well.\n\nI find it a bit difficult to fully describe and explain the gameplay, so i will recommend the gameplay video you can find in the community hub (if you dont mind some minor spoilers). Still i will also try to go over some basics. Your primary concern is to keep your colonists alive or at the very least some of them. To do this, you will want to keep morale and health at good levels, which is based on the supplies (food/drink) that are available (you can ration these) as well as the modules added to your base (providing you with supplies and ressources (for construction/upgrades/etc), but also with boni to health and happiness) and the decisions you make as a leader. The latter can range from choosing between salvaging, exploration or building to making tough calls in the various events that can occur throughout your journey. All of these aspects intertwine to some degree as a lucky event or locating and salvaging a good module may help you set up a base that gives you enough breathing space to handle a later unfortunate turn of fate.\n\nEdit: A question on replayability popped up on a different review and just to be sure, i will share my answer here as well.\n\n"[Replayability is] Pretty decent. Even after the 120 hours that steam logged for my testing, i still enjoy starting over for another round. I wouldn't say that you should expect as many hours as i have, since i racked a lot up due to my task, but the colony management and various events as well as 2 playable main characters and various endings (and the possibility of failure) certainly allow for several play throughs."\n\nTLDR:\nIt is indie. It is retro. It is good. It is not Telltale. It is not KoDP. It is The Next World.","March 7","true","112.6"," 16 of 24 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","16","24","0","0"

Much of the game feels unfinished or needs more balancing.  Fear the RNG because it doesn't take much in the first week of the game for a single disaster to force a roll back.  Additionally the mechanics of the game such as health or morale are completly hidden, you have no idea how much harm reduced rations will cause or what direction your popularity is going.  The popularity is especially important to know if you decided to allow elections, I had good morale but had no idea if this meant that I would be elected over my rival.\n\nOverall, don't buy now.  There is a lot of potential but the game needs to be finished first.","March 8","false","3.0"," 11 of 15 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","11","15","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/armaankhan/recommended/427860/","armaankhan","armz","http://steamcommunity.com/id/armaankhan/","454 products in account","I was surprised, surprised and relieved, in a good way, when I got to the end of The Next World. Up until I actually saw the end credits roll, I was certain, certain that my little colony was going to fail.\n\nThe Next World puts you in the role of either Shen or Lucy (your choice), as they try to lead a small group of survivors who’ve crashlanded on a hostile alien world. At first the goal is simple: “meet basic needs,” but it quickly escalates from there.\n\nGenre-wise, you’re looking at a visual novel that includes a small amount of base/resource management. It plays a bit like King of Dragon Pass in that there are random events that happen every turn, but The Next world offers more simplicity and direction than its inspiration. Whether that’s a good or bad thing is a matter of taste, but I personally lean toward good since the story is the real driver here. A more complicated simulation system would just frustrate your attempts to see what happens next.\n\nAs it stands, the base management part of The Next World focuses on ordering your vehicles around. Rovers can go exploring or salvaging; transports can also salvage (and are much better at it) or can be used to construct new buildings; both are required to perform special missions from time to time. Other than that, you can decide how much food your colonists get to eat, which affects their health and morale, which in turn affects whether or not you win or lose.\n\nYes, there is a lose condition in this game. If the population of your colony drops below 50 people, that’s it--game over man, game over. And it will drop. I forget exactly how many people I started with, but I believe it was well over a thousand, and that number slowly dropped as accidents, disease, and random events took them down. At one point, I was losing dozens of people every day due to illness, probably caused by the fact that I’d put them all on quarter-rations in order to get the resources necessary to build some important structures. By the time the colony stabilized to the point where it was generating sufficient food and resources, there were 63 people left. Which meant I spent the rest of the game with my fingers crossed that no more accidents would arise.\n\nThe tension generated by that experience is The Next World’s greatest selling point. I never felt like I was fully in control of the situation. I was always worried that every decision I’d been making was wrong. And I suspect that’s exactly what the developers wanted you to feel. After all, you play the role of a junior-ranking official thrust into a leadership position he/she was never prepared for. As I said at the start, the fact I got to a happy ending came as a pleasant surprise. I breathed a very real sigh of relief, content that things turned out all right, though still sad that a relative handful of my virtual citizens came out unscathed.\n\nYou’ll note I’ve been vague about the story. That’s deliberate, because there’s no way to talk about it without ruining the surprise. It’s quite well-written, though, and made my jaw drop more than once as plot twists were slowly revealed. The Next World is definitely one of my favorite visual novels to date… though, let’s face it, most of the competition is pretty lame.\n\nIt’s still a visual novel, though, and that’s the biggest criticism I can make about the game. Although I personally enjoy the form, there’s nothing in The Next World that will make an outsider feel the same. Current VN fans will find a lot to love here, as will anyone who enjoys good sci-fi tales. Less niche gamers, however, probably won’t; I’d have to direct those to the Telltale games instead.","March 15","true","4.6"," 6 of 6 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","6","6","0","0"

Individually the story or the gameplay doesn't really shine - I guessed the plot from a mile away and the endings really aren't anything special; the characters aren't too fleshed out beyond the first real chat and does not have special events specifically tied to them; the enigmatic elements of the game never really play an actual role and many climatic events just fell short despite its initial buildup; and the gameplay gets really bare when you realize that you've exhausted all possible events you can find in just, well, 3 hours.\n\nIn a way this feels more like an Early Access Game or a poor man's King of Dragon Pass. However, overall the game is a fantastic experience. The writing is really solid and the sprites and background art matches each other and the game perfectly. I've seen too many VNs out there with clashing arts/color tones that just ruins the overall experience before the player even go through a few lines, and I'm glad this VN isn't suspect to that flaw. The survival gameplay reminds me a bit of Planetbase (and thankfully and obviously considerably less difficult) and if there are additions of more events in the future I am certain that it'll be enjoyable enough for me to have another go.\n\nAs for things that need to improve, I'll try and keep it simple:\n1) More events in general. Exploring the planet gets boring real quick when you can count the number of events on two hands.\n2) More character specific dialogues/events, I mean, I would really like to know everyone more and see how they act under pressure. Also would like to see more events relating to the (spoilers!) AI Janet and alien microprobes.\n3) Linear events such as (spoilers!) the kids being infected by microprobes etc need more elaboration and impact, and I don't mean hey-did-you-notice-the-kids-are-getting-more-violent? kind of one glance mentions. Something like a scene where Michael or Shen's sister going super violent and beat the crap out of someone. It's old, but it works more than a scene where the kid's tearing apart his toy.\n4) More effects! Sound effects (explosions, beepingpeople screaming, chaos, raiders talking to each other etc), visual effects (again, explosions! etc).\n5) Minor UI issue I have but the mouse scroll-backlog is like a must feature on VNs. Also, your save screen is really un-user friendly.\n6) Gallery feature please! What's the point of having cool CGs, when you can't just refer to a CG Gallery and relieve them easily?","March 8","true","3.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The story is fantastic, reminiscent of Kim Stanley Robinson's Red Mars; the animation feels like you're in a comic book--makes the most of a "less is more" ascetic; gameplay is difficult but not overwhelming.

It's engaging at first how the game leaves you on a razors edge of balancing resoures, supplies & colonist lives, but eventually I couldn't scavenge much from the crash or find anything with my rovers. Slow inevitable death creeped in turn after turn as supplies and resources went to zero. I get that I must be doing something wrong but the game doesn't offer any help or seem to care.

It can be short if you try to rush through it and it can be challenging as heck or atleast it was when I was testing it. But maybe i was just making the wrong choices lol.\n\nThe story is interesting and something I have not really seen before. Its interesting to see a mix of colony management and visual novel.\n\nI think its pretty well done and i recomend people who enjoy reading science fiction stories, visual novels, lite management games and choose your own adventure stories to play the game.\n\nSometimes i felt like a few choices in the game didnt matter much but thats just me and thats how all other Choose Your Own Adventure stories always feel like to me lol.\n\nOverall its a fairly good game, with an interesting if not a little short story. But it is an interesting game none the less.","March 8","true","37.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

First few days are critical and if you don't know what you are doing (and you don't know) it's pure luck if you will salvage the right modules and materials to survive. It's easy to get stuck in a loop with no way out - if you start bad you will end bad. Also it's very short (3-3,5h tops).\nMy verdict is "almost but not quite" 4/10.\n\nPS. music is really nice","April 16","false","4.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

If you'd like to read our full review, you can find it here: https://www.universalgamingreviews.com/the-next-world-overview-and-review/\n\nThe Next world is a sci-fi visual novel game with base management features built in. The game follows the crew of an interstellar spaceship as they attempt to survive on the desolate and hostile planet, Ares after their ship crash lands on the planet. Things are not as they seem, however, and more of the mysteries behind the crash are revealed as the story progresses.\n\nThe game's base management features are a bit basic, with the ability to build various colony modules like a recycling center or a reactor and exploration of the planet and crash site using your 2 vehicles. Events occur often and the choices you make have different outcomes based on the action you choose, some good, others bad.\n\nThe Next World is a pretty enjoyable game though and even though the base management doesn't really have an impact on the overall story, the story itself is very enjoyable. The story gets pretty tense as it progresses too, the excellent writing enhances it quite a bit, as does the soundtrack.\n\nThanks for checking out our short summary and full review folks, happy gaming!\n\n-Shaun Meyers (Kyo Akiara) out!","March 27","true","8.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

And yes, in the beginning the story seems interesting, but when it comes to reading an actual novel I prefer reading a book. So after about ten minutes I started skipping some fractions of the text... then more... and more...\n\nSo I guess if I'd read every bit of the story it would be about 45 minutes of nothing but reading ... ah yes... and making descisions that don't seem to actually matter. Then again maybe I just picked the perfect choices... By now I'd say the story itself starts fine or better, so if you are into reading visual novels on screen you might want to check this one out.","March 24","false","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Lots of content in the first 30 minutes. Then it dries up a bit and you are left with managing your colony which is a bit shallow. By the time you get enough buildings to support your population there is nothing to build or do anymore, except wait for the next story event. The story wraps itself up in about 70 or 80 days. Maybe faster for some. The maker said he made the game based on the old "Outpost 2" game from '97. I think you should buy this game on sale for 5-8 dolars or euros...
