Even tho it's more of arcade game than simulator, it's really great. It's fun to complete training and gaining title of A0 Master, it's fun to beat weekly/overall records of certain maps and compete with others, it's fun to play on multiplayer and singleplayer. Sadly, there aren't many players and mostly you will play alone (you can do that on both single and multi option) but I hope it will change after game will leave early access. You can also customize your plane with special skins and stickers, which drops weekly like in CS:GO. With team of 2 people updates are going rather slowly but there is tracks editor, so if you think there aren't enough maps you can try yourself at making one. Even if this game is still in early access, it's at playable stage. I think Altitude0: Lower & Faster as final product will be something great.","August 28, 2015","true","119.6"," 11 of 14 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","11","14","0","0"

Please read the previous helpful customer reviews, because I couldn't agree more with their recommendations. Stick with Advanced plane control mode (though) and you will soon become one of best pilots around. We are trying to build strong community, with weekly multiplayer events, building user tracks... I'm sure broadcasting the MP events will bring some more pilots. Small dev team has definately developed a big game with an altitude :-)","January 24","true","161.1"," 12 of 16 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","12","16","0","0"

At the current version there are three planes to choose from, all with slightly variying characteristics.\n\nHaving spent more time with the game now, seeing the development pace, a small review correction was in line - the pilot wings experience i was talking about could still be achieved, but i don´t think it is going to happen soon´ish =)\n\n\n\n[old review]\nMy short "early access" summary so far, even with some vital features still missing:\n\nIf you always wanted "Pilot Wings" on PC (for the last 20 fricking years), this finally could be it - if (!) some vital  features like steam workshop support, an in-depth license system, stronger single player, and live multiplayer against friends made it into the game quickly.\n[/old review]","September 10, 2014","true","45.8"," 22 of 35 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","22","35","0","0"

Just go to options and select the difficulty setting) + the soundtrack is good too (Some more songs will be great too)\nThe online aspect is really cool too.Personally I am quite high in the ranks!\n\nAbout the items and P2W: There is no P2W here its all cosmetics that you can buy (Skins for your planes+stickers) You unlock parts in the single player challenges!\n\nI think this game is worthy of your time if you love flying planes!\nAs of 12/20/2014 I rate the game a solid 8.5/10\n\nCheers to developer!","December 23, 2014","true","2.4"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"
