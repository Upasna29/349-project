Now, with LOTR, POTC, and Batman 2, these games have complex "hub worlds" and hundreds of collectables of different sorts.  This game, Star Wars, and Batman (1) were the original Lego games with a bunch of characters, 10 minikit pieces per level, and not much else.  They seem basic compared to games like Lego LOTR, but this game, Indiana Jonse 1, was the best of the original lego games.  It has the best level design, a broad selection of the characters you'd want, a great soundtrack, and a general sense of completeness.  It has everything you'd want in a Lego Indy game (if you are not a big Crystal Skull fan--which I am not).  Some things about this game that are different from other early Lego games: You can pick up weapons (a fallen foe's scimitar, a native's spear, a Nazi's rifle).  It adds variety to mashing the fight button.  The game makes good use of Indy's whip.  It also reminds you of how great all three individual soundtracks were, and the difference between them.  Highly recommended for the casual player or devoted collector-type. :)","January 27, 2014","true","22.9"," 122 of 124 people (98%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","98","122","124","2","0"

Never mind that we only had one keyboard to share, the disc froze up more often than not, and we were both pretty bad at it, we loved every moment anyway. I just bought it again today, and surprise! it's still good. Clearly a labor of love, if a little unpolished.\n\nWhat isn't good game design is goofy and/or funny. What isn't goofy and/or funny is good game design. What isn't either of those is probably a little broken. Anything else is either John Williams' score or a plug for Lego Star Wars, and those both speak for themselves. Overall, this comes highly recommended. Everyone should have it.\n\nP.S. Also, it has really good animations. My personal judge of graphics is it's not so much the models and textures themselves, but more the animations, sound quality, etc. That has to be believable. The caricatures of humans and animals in Looney Tunes, for example, look far more lifelike than the anatomically correct carved wooden blocks representing humans in Deus Ex.","June 12, 2015","true","34.9"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","96","22","23","3","0"

Sure, it's fun for the most part, but a few hours in and you'll be having moments of deja vu thinking you've played a level like this beforehand.\n\nThere's an unfortunate element of repetition with this game and although the original soundtrack and characters help alleviate this you'll either be desperate to just complete it or just happy to put it to one side for another time.\n\nAs with all LEGO games there are the many characters to unlock and freeplay modes for those who want 100% completion, so for some there's a lot of playtime to be had.\n\nAll that said though, it's hard not to click the recommend button.  Being a thirty-something this game has my favourite toy and one of my favourite movie heroes in, so that's definitely worth a thumbs up on the whole.\n\n+ It's Indiana Jones\n+ Original soundtrack\n+ Lots of unlockables for 100% seekers\n+ No mention of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull\n\n- Repetitive\n- Awkward controls when precision movement is required\n- Missions are easy and can be somewhat dull","November 2, 2015","true","14.2"," 18 of 20 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","18","20","3","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/recommended/32330/","Foxysen","Foxysen","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Foxysen/","1172 products in account","Lego Indiana Jones: Original Adventures is sort of a sequel to Lego Star Wars, this time taking three original Indiana Jones movies and turning them once again into casual 3D Platformer in world where everything is made from Lego. It came out in 2008. It also had another Indiana Jones game in 2009, which takes all 4 movies as a basis. But from what I heard, it changed levels layouts and such, so Original Adventures is still worth getting.\n\nEDIT: Finally played Lego Indiana Jones 2. It's completely different. Like taking same basic idea of the first three movies plot, then changing it up and building up a "in a nutshell" levels from scratch. So yes, Original Adventures is still worth it.\n\nFrom technical side, it has a very nasty bug: you can't jump off the stuff that you built. It gets fixed easily, just turn on VSync. Yea, strange. But works. Lack of knowledge how to fix it is the reason why this game has mixed reviews right now, by the way.\nI also have trouble in Fullscreen mode in my Windows 8.1 where I have to alt-tab once for game to start to actually load after launching it. Otherwise you will be staring at the black screen forever.\nI also would recommend getting controller in this case. Didn't try it with keyboard, but there are some bridges and such where you want to have something more precise than keyboard.\n\nSo, when it comes to Traveller's Tales LEGO games, I only played Lego Star Wars and Lego Indiana Jones. And I can tell you that: While Indiana doesn't change core gameplay much, still being casual platformign where you can't run out of lives and more focused on collecting studs, it has much better pacing and game design to it. In second half of Lego Star Wars I wanted it to end already, while with Lego Indiana Jones I enjoyed the whole ride. It helps that Indiana Jones is shorter, so it doesn't outstay it's welcome. That, and sure it could be because I don't like Star Wars settings much. But hey, Indiana Jones feels more fitting to this game. At least because you don't travel with 3-5 characters who's AI ignores enemies. Or slow "just to open door" ones.\n\nIt takes storyline from movies, but does them in completely silent way, Just characters gruntng and making moves during cutscenes. There isn't even text that explains things like in Star Wars. And well, it still was enjoyable for what it is despite me never seeing a movie. I checked movie plots after playing these and also noticed that some scenes were changed a bit. So yea, movies fans will like comedy there. Well, if they like slapstick.\n\nPlatforming was improved, addings ledges and ropes for your adventuring. It takes a bit more spotlight at times. There are even parts in the game where you got ledges on circullar pillars that turn around and you have to time your jump. Quite enjoyable and simple.\n\nPuzzles are still nice too. You still have to use individual characters for some things, like Short Round can crawl into tiny entrances, heroine of second movie can scream so high that grass breaks and Indiana Jones is qutie a hero, using whip effectively to grab something or swing over pit. It's fairly stdandard pushing and pulling, along with taking some items and bringing them to other helps. Having to find tools for some actions also help to break monotomy. Heck, there even were at least two spots where I had no idea what to do next and had to actually think. It's still quite casual otherwise.\n\nFighting got improved too. Well, since game isn't about fighting, you can't truly die, it's just a better distraction now. Enemies don't appear as often for one. Indiana can do a nice kill animation (well, as much as you can say that for kids lego games) if he attacks in same time as enemy does.Whip can be used there too. To vary things up, most of main characters can only melee, punching and slapping. Instead, they can take and grab additional weapons, whether it's throwable sword, a chair or a huge rifle. It once again helps to break up monotomy, even though game is a bit less fair thsi way. But hey, seeing how fighting isn't punishing and isn't focus, it's just nice not just mashing same attack buttong while watching character avoid everything as well.\nThere are still cases when waves of infinite enemies will annoy you while you are thinking what to do next in puzzle, sadly. Enemies with explosives are frustrating to fight against too.\n\nAnd yea, you still collect much studs. Breaking stuff and doing things, explorign levels for treasures to collect statue out of 10 of them on each level. Plus, one red post per level that unlocks extra bonuses, mostly cheating ones. They are still fun to find. It's just that Free Play where you can freely select needed character during gameplay is the way to go when you want to collect everything. And it's a shame, since you may feel that collecting anything during Story Mode is somewhat pointless by comparsion. There are some treasures that require thinking to get in Story Mode but easily picked up in Free Play, and some you can get only in Free Play. I would had liked if there were treasures for Story Mode only too.\n\nSo, it's nicely done Lego game, which gets pacing down, so even normal players will not get too bored. Well, at least not will feel like it should end already. I would recommend picking this one over Lego Star Wars for sure. Though it's still casual game, so depends.","August 10, 2015","true","12.3"," 15 of 16 people (94%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","94","15","16","0","0"

In other words, it runs better than vanilla Dark Souls. :P","October 5, 2015","true","4.3"," 13 of 15 people (87%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","87","13","15","8","0"

The game is just like the other lego games where you collect studs and minikit buy new figures and clear the level. One of the problems with the game is that the level is to long which can take about 30 min to beat a level. If you actully play a hour of this game in one sit you will get bored with this game since you just doing the same thing. The last problems i have with this is the temple doom stage are just so boring that you will probaly skip this episode. After all that you  mayby find this game fun if you just  play one stage  each time you go into the game . otherwise you will hate this game because is just like lego starwars and you are just doing the same stuff over and over again.

I remember playing this all the time on the PSP but now I have it on PC and how do I feel about it? It is hard to answer that question due to nostalgia but I will try my best. So this game is fun even though it is intended for kids. The best thing for me is that it is about the original three movies and not the fourth one. But this was when the characters didn't speak words but spoke in giberish. This game has some cool mechanics to it and alot of charcters and colectables to find so I would say this game is worth a buy.

I have played every level twice and am at about 90% completion so I don't quite see what was unfinishable about the first level.\n\nI feel this game is part of the Golden Era in the LEGO games alongside Star Wars Complete Saga and Batman 1. After Star Wars I where they've refined everything and figured out what works, but before they started expanding with overworlds that are part of the story or the horror of voice acting. The charm comes from them telling the story you already know through slapstick mime. I know Batman was an original story but I won't go into that because this is about Indy not Batman.\n\nGameplay wise: It's incredibly simple.\nIf you can push things into a position, push them into place then proceed.\nIf you need a certain type of character to proceed, tag them then proceed.\nIf you don't have that character on you, then you either need to steal a hat or it's something intended for Free Play mode.\nIf you need a certain item to proceed, obtain it and then proceed.\nIf you cannot find the item you need, you are either trying to go into an area intended for Free Play mode, or you haven't smashed enough things that the item may be hiding behind/inside.\n\nI know it's simple, but it's fun. Except the Bridge Battle on Temple of Doom. That is the only problem I have with this game.\n\nI will admit there were two bugs I encountered - but both were easily overcome. One was the intended solution for posting one of the parcels doesn't seem possible. But there's another solution that really wasn't hard to think up myself, and given it's a puzzle game I don't mind them forcing people to actually think about their solution, deliberately or not.\nThe other is on one level, it mistakes having thrown a sword at a green piece where you're meant to attach something for the actual something, and so it won't let you attach it but it also won't respond as though you have attached it. So just be careful when throwing swords in Last Crusade.","January 1","true","20.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

It's a superb game, no question. Humorous and fun to play, you will notice a lot of easter eggs if you are an Indiana Jones fan. This game is perfect for anybody who likes Indiana Jones. If you want to buy it, then go ahead. You won't regret it if it's on sale. It's not worth the full 20€ though.\n\nBut if you are not sure whether to buy it or not, then I advice you to get Lego Star Wars - The Complete Saga instead. It has more content and a greater motivation to play it again multiple times after finishing it. That doesn't mean that Lego Indiana Jones is a bad game (it's quite the opposite), but Lego Star Wars is in my opinion a little bit better.\nAnd if you really want it, you can play Indy in Lego Star Wars too.\n\nTo put it into perspective, I would rate Lego Star Wars with 9.5/10 and Lego Indiana Jones with 9.0/10.

It really should be on a banner emblazoned on the first screen of the game.\nNow on to the real review.\nThis game has some elements that really improve it, and others that really set it back.\nPros: A freeplay mode that doesn't break away to cutscenes every stage, doesn't at all in fact. Good job.\nStaying true to the original story and only spoofing as extra content.\nAdded easter eggs from the Star Wars game. Now I want to visit the Mos Eisley cantina in Egypt.\nJohn Williams is the man. Great soundtrack.\nThis is my childhood.\n\nCons: Should have a little banner when you pull up the menu that says "Unable to jump on certain platforms? Try turning\non V-sync."\nThere were a few points where I had to force co-op to complete parcel deliveries. This being either because\nscenery platforms are buggy to jump on, or the computer would throw the barrel off when you needed to jump on\nit. This problem is compounded by the problem that keyboard can't drop out, you have to quit out to the main\nmenu to boot it.\nYou don't have access to all characters in freeplay, and the computer will not always ensure that you have all the\ncharacters that you need.\n\nI didn't encounter any real game breaking bugs, but there are enough issues present to present a bit of a turn off.\n\nThose are all the points that I can think of off the top of my head after 100%ing it. One point to note is that while this game has the same price tag as Lego Star Wars: TCS, it has less than half the content and is less polished, which is confusing as this game came out AFTER the Star Wars game. You have to watch an in game advert hyping this game to 100% Star Wars. For comparison, I did 51 hours to 100% Star Wars, 17 hours to 100% this.\nI can only really conclude that this game is Traveller's Tales unloved child.","April 16","true","17.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

They have kept the fun fundamental gameplay, stripped out the boring repetition, dialled up the silliness and it has paid off beautifully. It is still a very early LEGO game so it has a fair few bugs; the infamous v-sync bug, the way it occasionally kicks out one of the players and how it sometimes doesn’t give you the right characters to complete a free play level. Also there are still more improvement to come later; it doesn’t have split screen or dialogue yet. But don’t let any of that put you off this is the point where the awesomeness of the LEGO games overtakes their shortcomings.","September 13, 2015","true","17.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The game glitches all the time. Indy can't even build anything without using his whip after *each single block he builds*. The motorcycle escape level is certainly finishable, but the broken vehicle controls and the level design do their best to frustrate you. There are parts that are actually fun to play, but they are too few and the rest is just a glitchy frustrating mess.\n\nIf you like Indy (like me), grab it when it goes on sale for a fiver, but don't expect much.

The theme of the game makes it easy to overlook the flaws. Everyone loves Indiana Jones, right?\nOne problem is that the gae breaks several times. You can't achieve objectives, because the game won't trigger key events. Luckily this can be fixed by replaying the level.\nEven more frustrating is the difficult jumping. It is often hard to see where you will land, especially if the room to land is small. Traversing small beams etc. for extra loot is just frustrating. Character control feels often bad.\nThe last campaign is pretty badly done. Several areas with never-ending waves of enemies. Stupid driving sections on bikes with the bad controls. Add to this mines that are often unavoidable and a chasm where you fall in.\n\nOverall: Consider getting it if you like Indiana Jones and LEGO games. For the rest, there are better LEGO games out there.\n","January 1","false","9.5"," 6 of 20 people (30%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","30","6","20","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spackeck/recommended/32330/","spackeck","Spackeck","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spackeck/","301 products in account","Adapting a franchise into a cartoony action platformer in which a lot of things are inexplicably made of Lego is a strange idea to say the least, but it worked for the Star Wars franchise, mostly because the beloved sci-fi series is full of iconic characters and scenes recognisable at a glance, thus somewhat justifying the 150+ playable characters—you’ll recognise most of them if you’ve seen the films. Furthermore, each level of Lego Star Wars was based on memorable scenes from the films, thus creating a consistent feeling of familiarity throughout.\n\nUnfortunately, developer Traveller’s Tales seem to have misinterpreted what made the Lego Star Wars games good. Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures is a rather boring adaptation of the first three Indiana Jones films. You’d think adapting such a property would be a no-brainer, what with all the puzzles and action that are already present. Instead we’re walked along a reluctant slog through Raiders of the Lost Ark and its two notably worse sequels, containing unending puzzles consisting of ‘put object in location to progress’, cutscenes full to the brim of exactly one joke and constant combat in which enemies have varyingly powerful guns and you have your fists.\n\nAt least Lego Indiana Jones is somewhat aesthetically pleasant. While there are no iconic spaceships rendered with Lego this time around, the characters still look good, and there seemed to be even more character-specific animations, which were a visual highlight of Lego Star Wars for me. Stylistically, the environments are painstakingly dull, with each of the three movies containing maybe one level set outside of a desert or jungle. In spite of the environmental design, it’s still nice to look at, and John Williams’ soundtracks for the original films are as good as they were in the ‘80s. That said, Lego Indiana Jones lacks the unique sound effects of Star Wars, perhaps an inherent shortcoming of the source material. Nevertheless, the game’s soundscape does leave a bit to be desired, even if it is just for lack of a few little effects.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, Lego Indiana Jones forgoes the extremely simplistic yet somewhat relaxing puzzle design of Star Wars, instead introducing scavenger hunts in which the player must pick up an object (always annotated by a little marker) and carry it to a certain machine or piece of floor (also annotated by a little marker). Once this is complete, all that’s really left to be done is turning a little wheel or pulling a lever, or doing something functionally identical that also requires a specific character, and good luck figuring out which character you need, because every playable character in this game is a variant of Indiana Jones, a Nazi, a somewhat generic man or one of about two women. The gameplay is just a huge step backward from Star Wars, with painfully frustrating combat, including a memorable instance in which infinitely respawning Nazis with rocket launchers killed me repeatedly until I got so irritated I had to go and watch Inglourious Basterds to shake off the residual antipathy.\n\nIn summary, Indiana Jones just lacks the iconic imagery to pull off a game like this. Sure, we all know a few famous scenes, primarily from the original film, but after that it’s just another few hours of the same desert levels divided by cutscenes featuring the all-time favourite joke of ‘a character is hit by an object’. Maybe I am just criticising slapstick comedy on the whole due to my overall dislike towards the game, but I really quite liked Raiders, and I truly feel that the series deserves better than what is essentially the equivalent of a particularly violent episode of Sesame Street.","February 16","false","18.1"," 6 of 21 people (29%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","29","6","21","2","1"
