"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cirby64/recommended/383980/","Cirby64","Corey","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Cirby64/","159 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWords cannot describe the amount of enjoyment I've had playing this game and interacting with its – at the time, small community since February. Yes, contradictory to my playtime here on Steam, I've been playing this game since February of this year.\n\nRivals of Aether is a fast paced, Platform-fighter (Smash Bros. like game). And is the closest to Smash Bros. any game has ever been aside from Smash Bros. itself of course. However the core mechanics have been mixed up a bit.\n\nThis is basically a review for you folk that know how Smash Bros. works, maybe have some experience in the competitive scene, and are already hovering over the 'Add to Cart' button. If you don't know what I'm talking about, you might want to read another review. However I can definitely vouch for the game being an incredibly fun experience for the more casual players too.\n\nSo, let's get to it.\nNo Shield, but instead a Parry that on hit puts your enemy in a longer hitlag state, and grants you a short window of invulnerability.\n\nNo Ledges, but instead you can wall-jump once out of your Up-Special/Special Fall, and use your Up-Special again.\n\nNo L-Cancelling, but instead aerials more or less auto cancel on landing. So the game is still very fast, just requires less inputs to go fast.\n\nNo Grabbing, and nothing to replace it. This adds a different dynamic to the game for sure. Whether that's good or bad, is really subjective.\n\nDirectional Airdodges are a thing, however they don't put you into Special Fall afterwards. You still only get one Airdodge per air-time, and trust me, you better use that one Airdodge you get very wisely. I will detail why in the next bullet point... And yes there is Wavedashing. Whether it's useful or not is hard to say at the moment, you should just see for yourself.\n\nHitstun can feel extremely overwhelming when playing against a skilled player. Perfect DI (Yes DI is also a thing) can be crucial to stopping your enemies combos. The Airdodge you get helps, but you only get one per air-time, so again, use it wisely.\n\n1v1 Unranked Online (Invite or vs Random) only at the moment. If you were planning to do doubles online, that might be a thing in the future, just not now.\n\nIf you are planning to use your Gamecube controller, and you already own an adapter for your PC, follow this guide and be illuminated - http://bigfriendlygames.net/2015/09/19/rivals-of-aether-on-steam/ Though I must say that Xbox and Playstation controllers work perfectly for this game.\n\nAmount of Characters will be 8 at full release (This is early access). However the future might be holding some DLC for us, who knows? As of writing this, 7 characters are playable and they are all excessively unique from each other.\nI will probably revise this review from time to time, but for now this should be pretty much everything you could want to know.\n\nI hope to see you in-game!\n\nAlso a big thanks to everyone involved in the early days of the game. It's gonna go far. I'm sure.\n\nEdit: It's been a while since I wrote this, but all of it still applies, and things have only gotten better!","September 22, 2015","true","57.7"," 342 of 356 people (96%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","96","342","356","12","17"

But if you think:  "hey mane this game is a super smash br0s cloon!!!1", you're wrong. It has the idea of super smash bros but it sure is diffrent than it. You have lots of diffrent characters (now 6 of them) and they all feel quite balanced! The game has a lot of charm, smooth and cool pixelated animations, cool and vibrant colours, every character has it's own little gimic, etc. If you're a fan of the smash series I recomment you buy this game. If you've never played smash (like me) and always wanted to, this is the game for you.\n\nHere are my pros and cons of the game:\n\nPros:\n- 6 diffrent and very unique and balanced characters to play ( so far )\n- 5 original stages ( so far )\n- High skill ceiling, lots of new combos and stuff to learn\n- Easy to hop into, you would probably understand the game in less than an hour. (if you've gamed before of course)\n- Combo-ing someone feels very satisfying since there is some hitlag and it's pretty difficult to do so.\n- Runs smooth, customizable, all kinds of skins.\n- Very cool graphics in my opinion\n- Lots of potential, there will probably be some stuff added in the future. (sorry for my poor English)\n- Cool training system where you can test stuff with bots\n\nCons:\n- You can't really see your ping with someone, so you don't know where they're from and you don't know why you're lagging.\n- You can't exit out of a match in game, you have to kill yourself when you want to exit.\n- Long hitlag can be annoying at times.\n\nThanks for reading my review!\nDefenitely recomment this game.\n","September 27, 2015","true","7.4"," 67 of 79 people (85%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","85","67","79","7","0"

It is way quicker and more combo intense than even both trailers let on.\n\nIt is an incredible combination of Melee movement and Smash 64 hitstun. This comes together in the form of incredible combos that can sometimes be 0 to death if you read peoples techs and DI properly.\n\nYES! THERE IS DI. Combo DI and Smash DI. There is wavedashing, wavelanding, edge cancelling, reverse aerial rush, some characters can jump cancel, theres a character with a double jump cancel and the 8th character can DACUS. Ignore the negative reviews. The lack of shielding makes this an incredibly strategic and aggressive game and the latest patch really made camping difficult and the balance of the game has never been better! The negative reviewers need to GET GOOD. Learn to parry god dammit!\n\nThere is no ledge, every character has a wallkick that refreshes your recovery and the recoveries in rivals are insane so edge guarding is incredibly fun. There are no items. The stages are all playable and there are no "banned" stages. Hazards can be put on for fun but they are always disabled in online play and in fact ive never seen them used.\n\nThis game is a love letter to competetive smash fans and i am incredibly passionate about it and would hate to see people turned away by comments like "i cant parry good enough games imba!!111"\n\nIf you love smash, just buy it right now. Quit wasting time! And if your a fighting game fan in general, theres definetly the depth of gameplay youll need to find something here.\n\nLet this game reach its full potential. <3\n\n","March 15","true","63.3"," 40 of 43 people (93%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","93","40","43","5","0"

If you enjoy Melee, or Smash in general, you will most likely enjoy this game. Rivals of Aether takes many idea from Melee and implements them into their own game. The special thing to the game is the characters. Each character is super unique and very different. Every character has a very distinct moveset that is different from what Melee could ever achieve. There are also new mechanics to the game, and some mechanics taken away from Smash. One example is the Parry system. Sheilding in Smash has been replaced with a parry in Rivals of Aether. There are, however, techniques from melee that carry over, such as wavedashing.\n\nBottom line is, if you like Smash, you will probably enjoy Rivals of Aether. I personally think this game is definitely worth the buy and overall an amazing game.\n\n\n\nNo johns.","January 29","true","67.6"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","96","22","23","2","1"

Providing your willing to put in some time, you will end up absolutely loving this game, most people get addicted (average playtime I see is like 80 hours) very quickly. Me personally, well I'm way beyond 80 hours. Don't be discouraged by super good players online, odds are they've just put more time into this game than you. Now that that's cleared up, here are the pro's and con's.\nPros	-Well-Balanced\n-Incredibly Fast\n-Mechanic's are almost perfect\n-Every character is completely different\n-Literally no skill cap, you can always get better under all circumstance\n-Competitive fighter that has a secondary party game function (think smash bros)\n-Graphics are very appealing\n-Combo's are incredibly fun\n-Great community\n-Online tournaments, every first sunday of the month theirs a monthly with a 120$ prize pool distributed between the top 8\n\nCons	-Unfished-ish, some bugs and slightly stupid things\n-Hard to get good at, 200 hours and not even amazing yet :P\n-Klling opponents can get very difficult with certain characters\n-Edgegaurding is incredibly difficult\n\nOverall 10/10, fantastic game and it's not even finished yet, get it under any circumstance.","May 7","true","201.6"," 24 of 27 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","24","27","0","0"

I’m somewhere between beginner and intermediate, so I can’t comment on how the game is played at high level. I’ll share my experience and thoughts as a casual player.\n\nThe controls have an elegant simplicity that grants the game its appeal and low skill floor. Simply input a direction and one of the attack buttons simultaneously to perform an attack in that direction. There are three attack buttons corresponding to tilts, strong attacks and special attacks. The same controls apply universally to all characters and they all share quite similar tilts and strong attacks, so that once you learned to play with one character, you can find your bearings with any of them.\n\nThere are only 8 characters but each has a pretty unique moveset with some specific quirks, especially when it comes to special attacks. This can be both great and somehow bothering at the same time. Great because every character has a distinct playstyle and everyone is guaranteed to find at least a few tailored to them among this small but varied cast. Bothering because it steepens the learning curve for two reasons when compared to Smash. First, it slightly gets in the way of skill transfer from character to character. Secondly, matchups knowledge becomes more important.\n\nBy no means I want to give the impression that this is an actual issue and that the game is in fact hard to learn, it is still very easy to pick up, it only makes it harder to master. And yet, RoA brings some of its own simplicity to the genre. It pares down the mechanics and trims the formula to its essential components by removing grabs, edge grabbing, L-cancelling, shields (replaced with parries), … What remains at the core is a streamlined gameplay that prominently features exhilarating kickass combos.\n\nThe result is a mechanically tight game with a low skill floor, high skill ceiling, and a learning curve sloped to quickly and comfortably project players towards the more fast paced, technical and competitive side of platform fighters.\n\nI absolutely recommend this game to anyone who prefers Melee to other Smash games. This is the closest you will get on PC. It manages to capture both the simplicity and depth that I enjoyed in Melee while still having its own flavor and charm.\n\nAlthough it isn’t a party game and is definitely positioned towards the competitive end of the spectrum, I also strongly recommend it to newcomers. I mostly play casually with friends at my skill level, and even so I enjoy it much more than the few other alternatives on PC. The action is fast paced, the combos you can pull off even as a beginner are really awesome, and it’s overall extremely fun.","April 16","true","56.2"," 20 of 21 people (95%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","95","20","21","0","0"

When you get hit, you can hold a direction on your control stick and you'll alter your trajectory from the hit.\n\nI was part of the alpha test from August 31 2014, and the most recent test build I was apart of was March 2015.\n\nI instantly fell in love and started showing the game off and playing with my friends. All of us play melee competitively, and while there are some differences from Smash, this game could easily pass as part of the main series.\n\nCirby (on steam), is a member of the community I respect very, very much. He wrote an excellent review for this game, and I suggest you read it. His review will explain the major differences between RoA and a Smash game.\n\nI'm going to talk about how /fun/ this game is.\n\nIf you look back at all of the best video games in history 99/100 times they all have one thing in common: a quality movement system. To explain what I'm talking about lets look at Mario Kart. Normally you have total control over your kart, you can speed up, speed down, break, hop, do a trick, angle yourself, etc. The only time you don't have control is when you get hit by an item. The frustrating part about getting hit with an item isn't that you stop, the frustrating part is that you lose ALL control. You can't try and steer to avoid falling off of the track, you just go forward a little at a fixed speed.\n\nPack in a great hitstun/combo system, some decent players that can read, react and play mind games, a GREAT 1v1 online system and 4 player offline for those into that kind of thing and you have a great overall package.\n\n\nHere are some gfycats of some real gameplay (from an older build, but still the same game really) so you can see some..not randy day 1 gameplay. Keep in mind, these are from an older build and are not fully the same as the product you are buying now.\n\n\nhttps://gfycat.com/HeftyIncompleteArgentineruddyduck\n\nhttps://gfycat.com/WindyHilariousHochstettersfrog\n\nhttps://gfycat.com/IlliterateFaroffFawn\n\nhttps://gfycat.com/SizzlingZestyKiwi\n\nhttps://gfycat.com/GiantSpryDassierat\n\n\nNotice how much fun we're having?

It's not graphically intensive or anything so you will most likely be able to run it in a medium-low end computer.\n\nSOUND\nWhile the music is alright, not something extremely memorable, i have to give Kudos to the ones behind the sound design, it's, in a few words, on point, every attack and hit sounds how it should and it really makes it feel like more of an impact when you land it.\n\nCOMBAT AND GAMEPLAY\nThe meat of Rivals of Aether is it's combat system, while obviously inspired in SSB, it differs quite a bit, there's no ledge grab system, you get your moves, a walljum and an air dodge, use them how you want, you also have acces to a pretty unique(even tho a bit small) roster, with each character having it's own gimmick, you have Wrastor's incredibli strong air game coupled with the ability to triple jump, or maypuls marking, allowing you for easy saves(Try to avoid using it for saves against higer skilled players) or double tapping your strong attacks, so you'll have a hard time adjusting if you are like most of the playerbase, who come from SSB.\n\nMy only real complaints to this game are the fact that, first, it isn't really begginner friendly, with a stupidly high skill ceiling, coupled with a matchmaking that's only a system that pairs you with the first other opponent it finds and a community that came from a similar game of which a lot of people already know what they're doing makes it really tough for begginners who don't have much experience in the platformer fighting genre, and second, There is no 4 player online matches at the date of this review.\n\nTo sum it up:\nPROS\nMemorable character design\nGreat fighting system\nGood sound design\nHigh skill ceiling, meaning there's a lot of gameplay available\nE-sports presence\n\nCONS\nNo actual matchmaking\nNot begginner friendly\nOnly 1v1 multiplayer available\nStory hasn't been implemented\n\nTL;DR:\nI'd recommend you to buy this game if you're willing to spend the time on a competitive game to develop your skills in it, if not, i'd wait for the game to be fully released out of early access to give it a look.","January 3","true","12.1"," 18 of 22 people (82%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","82","18","22","2","0"

ROA has great pixel art, with each character and stage looking vibrant. ROA has an interesting selection of 6 characters (2 additional characters planned in future updates), from a four-legged orca whale to a styling avian. Each character is completely unique, my favorite being Forsburn, a dagger-wielding assassin type character with abilities such as\n- smokescreen (neutral special) to deliver a surprise attack from an unknown position.\n- decoy (side special) to throw off the opponent, with the same abilities as its source, its attacks can also create/extend combos.\nAnother thing I like about Aether is the crazy amount of moves that combo into each other, it's all so smooth, and the game is only in alpha so there's no doubt it'll even further improve.\nMy one complaint so far is the online matchmaking. About 90% of my matches have been players immediately self-destructing without even attempting to fight. Though this may be due to lag on the other end, it's not apparent to me as each of the games have been smooth on my end. it's. really. annoying. It takes forever to get into a match where the person actually plays. I feel like some sort of penalty could possibly be implemented to fix this.\nIf you're looking for an interesting fighting game with endearing art, music, characters, and smooth gameplay, you're in the right place!

As in dota 2 is not like Lol.\n-I coudln't tell if this game was in Early Access, i only found out after a long session of gameplay.\n\nCons\n-Controls are not exactly like it is in smash bros so you must get used to the changes.\n-No ranking as of yet; be prepared to lose again and again...\n\nStyle:\n\nThis game reminds me of Megaman more than Smash bros because of the sound effects.\n\nWhen you die, same sound effect as when you die in a megaman game. Each stages looks like a bit of what you usually see in a megaman game.\nWith that said, you will have the impression that each enemies come from a megaman game(the bosses). I know, i sound like a broken record by now, but if you play it yourself, you will eventually get it.\n\nGameplay and differences from Smash bros:\n\n-Blocking has been removed and replaced with a parry. On parry, your opponent become unable to move for a split second which leaves you enough time to counter-attack.\n-You can no longer use grapples and theres no grapple-type character.\n-For the melee freaks, you can wave-dash and it's a lot more easier to perform.\n-You can perform Air-dodge only once while in mid-air. Afterwards, you can do anything else while still in mid-air.\n-After Up+special(Up+B smash bros), you can only do it again if you bounce off the wall and you can no longer edge-guard.\n-Extremely reliant on juggles-combos.\n\nROA vs SB:\n\nMore like melee, but you don't feel like you must exploit the game to win and while everything is easy to perform (including wave-dashes), high level play is still a very long way after you feel confident enough.\n\nI personally find this game to be a lot more addictive than any other smash bros game; even the online net-code is better than the one found in smash 4.","February 7","true","40.4"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","14","16","0","0"

For the price, it's well worth your money whether you're looking to play Smash but don't have a Nintendo console or are already really into Smash. There's a lot this game offers. The character roster may look small, yes. Right now it has a mere 6 fighters with 2 more to be released by the game's launch, and only 5 stages with 3 more to be released, but the depth the gameplay brings to the table is so engaging that I find it hard for me to not look forward to coming back to it again and again.\n\nThe fighters take a lot from multiple Smash characters and mix them into one but a lot of their movesets and specials are so unorthodox from Smash that it's a breath of fresh air for avid fans like myself. The major differences you'll notice right away are that there is no ledge grabbing and there is no shielding. You can wall jump (usually) after doing your up special and you can parry attacks (hitting the block button exactly when the other person's move would hit you). It leaves them vulnerable for a second for you to counter-attack. It fits with the game's playstyle and it's really cool to see new takes on standard Smash mechanics.\n\nWavedashing is also here, and it's much easier to do than in any of the Smash games. No character has a short wavedash, so it's viable for everybody and useful to learn and apply to your fighting eventually. Overall I'd rate this game a 9.5/10, would be a perfect score but for real can we please nerf Zetterburn and Kragg a bit?

Being a huge competitive smash player, I appreciate that there is no "Final Destination" style stage, as platforming is a big part of smash, although it would be a welcome addition. The cast has very few characters, but this honestly helps with the game's approach with each character revolving around a specific gimmick such as; Orcane's teleportation, Frosburn's cloning and Wrator's midair smash attacks. I do belive as of no some characters do need to be nerfed *cough* Absa *cough* the ballance is mostly fair. Even though the game is still in developement it does lack things such as a campaign but the modes are still displayed on the menus to tell the player what's to come. Some suggestions for additions are items to make the game playable by a larger audience of smash fans and to make some platforms more visable in the foreground to make it easier on new players.\n\nOverall: 8/10 A fantastic game for smash fans and non smash fans alike.

I have personally found L-Cancelling to be a hassle, so I was happy to find that there is very little (maybe even zero) landing lag in Rivals of Aether.\n- The basic attacks are all there, but a lot of characters have much more interesting mechanics (i.e. Wrastor's aerials freezes him in the air.) Combo-ing with these attacks feels awesome due to the small amount of hitlag on each attack.\n-There are no more grabs or ledge grabbing which some people find questionable. However, the lack of grabs adds to much more fluid gameplay relying on attacks to start combos rather than grabs. Also, ledge grabbing has been pratically replaced with wall jumping, which is much different to say the least.\n-In my opinion, the characters in this game are much more unique than the characters featured in Super Smash Bros. Each character in this game has a unique gimick besides just attacks, specials, and aerials. I hope that future characters will flow as well as the current ones.\n-Rivals of Aether is a game that endorses competetive play and is built for it. This game will feel like a Smash Bros. game made for competetive play. If you like Smash Bros. You will like this game.\n-Has support for Xbox 360 controllers and keyboard. You can also use a Gamecube controller if you follow these instructions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVu8xJ7Bs6o\n-The music is very good, and I personally love the art style. However, due to the lack of stages the music can become   repetetive.\n-Comes with a cool training mode that allows you to experiment and play with bots in any way you want.\n\nCons:\n-Many of the fights experienced online will be choppy and filled with button lag. From my experience, most games I've played have been realtively low on the lag scale. Whenever I play with friends there is no noticeable input lag or choppiness in the gameplay.\n-The game is in early access, so you don't really know whether this game will really become something with your money. I say this from personal experience with many early-access games that I have purchased, which I'm aware is my own mistake.\n-I don't necessarily know if this is a con, but to all the Melee fans out there: Rivals of Aether is not Melee 2.0.\n\nConclusion:\nI definitely missed lots of pros and cons, but overall, I believe Rivals of Aether is very entertaining and worth the price tag due to the replayability of the game. As stated previously: If you like Super Smash Bros. in any way, shape, or form, you will like this game.\n","October 1, 2015","true","12.7"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","12","17","2","0"

It's $15 as opposed to the hundreds of dollars for a Wii U and Smash Bros (you still have to spend money on a gamecube adapter and controller if you use those, but you can use any USB controller or keyboard if you prefer.\n\n2. Made by a company that wanted to make a more competitive version of smash. They succeeded by making a platform fighter that has an incredibly balanced (albeit small) roster, no items, neutral stages, and advanced techniques reminiscent of Super Smash Brothers Melee to create a high skill ceiling.\n\n3. The simple graphics allow almost any computer to run this game at 60 fps with no problems whatsoever.\n\n4. The online matches don't feel as laggy as the online mode in Smash Bros for Wii U.\n\n5.

For sure this game is one of the best early access games out there if youre a fan of smash & games influenced by smash, or even just a competitive person then its a must have,personally id rather buy rivals 4 times than get any new $60 game out there...except for dark souls 3 ;3","March 10","true","178.3"," 16 of 25 people (64%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","64","16","25","4","5"

The core idea is the same: Deal as much damage as possible to your opponent as possible, while taking the least you can. Higher damage means you get sent farther when hit, ultimately resulting in players being sent flying off stage, either colliding with the end of the screen and dying, or being forced to try and make their way back to the stage with their opponent actively trying to prevent it.\n\nIf you're looking for a fun fighting game featuring some stellar game design, you've come to the right place.\n\nIf you are a fan of Smash, you absolutely need to play this game.

It take skill, but I would probably say less than smash, but that is just due to the amount of time that people have been playing it and had experiance with it. Also, the inputs are easier compared to melee, for instance. This game is like somehwere in between PM/melee and brawl/smash 4 and the devs have nearly hit the sweetspot.  this game is fairly balanced, though I do have a few things to pick on and say to the contrary.\n\n(EDIT: below I complain about forsburn. He is not the easies to play but he is very strong, I have come to realize. He is a top tier character and this game is very well balanced for the most part.. people used to think fors and maypul were bad but it turns out they are the best in the game. All the other characters are still competitive, though. The opinions below were premature and do not reflect the current meta, but a much earlier one; they also reflect how I felt as a less skilled player. If you like fast paced platform fighting and competitive play get this game. the cast is small but that is for balance reasons. THe cast is very diverse while small, and this game has given me some of the best experiences of any I've ever played. The community is very good for the most part. I have literally added 80 to my friendslist through this game)\n\nThis game is great but it defnitely needs a few tweeks. I play forsburn, probably one of if not the hardest characters in the game, and while I am happy with him, it is hard not to fall prey to  the rest of the cast, particularly wrastor and zetterburn.\nHeck he has a hard time agains most everybody. Once you get to learn how to play him, things do get easier and more doable, but it's not hard for things to become and uphill battle if your opponent know what they are doing as well. I think he requires a bit more awareness and reads, which is not bad i guess, but it is also true of bowser, the worst char in melee.\n\nSo I think forsburn may be a bit underpowered, but that may just speak to the difficulty of playing him. its not that his moves are super bad, they are just easier to punish than most other characters.\n\nThe rest of the cast seems really tight. wrastor is ridiculous but they just nerfed him so.....  not gonna go any further than that. Not that the rest of the cast isnt great. wrastor can just wall you out, his moves have a ton of priority and range, and he can through out tons of them.\n\nanyway, this game is a lot of fun and i played 16 hours in 2 days.. it's a bit addictive.... props to the devs hope to see more great things.","October 3, 2015","true","166.7"," 6 of 7 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","6","7","0","0"

Much like Super Smash Bros. Melee, it's fast paced and a lot of fun. Not only that it brings back a lot of advanced movement such as WaveDashing and DashDancing. If you have 15$ to spare this is definitely worth it! Another aspect about this game that will catch your attention are the characters. They bring strange and unique movesets to the battlefield and it's always fun to mess around and see what combo you can pull off. The only minor problem is that online can sometimes be a hassle, but nonetheless, it's probably one of the best "smash-inspired" game I've ever played.

This game stays true to its goal of bringing smash to pc, not only does it have the feel of melee but it isnt just a clone unlike all the other browser based smash games. The characters are honestly my favorite part about it, every single one feels 100% viable from a competetive aspect. Even Kragg, who fills the role of the slow paced big character, which usually is out of place in the smash games, feels great and playable against the rest of the cast. All of the cast feels vibrant and different from the rest which is amazing to see. For example my favorite (orcane) has entire strings that are possible off of a bubble detonation from a puddle. In a competetive fighting game, diversity is a GREAT thing to see, as it keeps the game fresh. It gets tiring to see the same characters all the time. From my short time playing it I can already see this game has immense potential in both a competetive sense and just for casual fun with friends. I would definetly reccomend this to anyone who is a fan of the smash franchise or just fun in general.","September 26, 2015","true","66.1"," 8 of 11 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","8","11","0","0"

Its suprisingly well balanced for just having hit early access and brings some new fun mechanics to the table while removing things such as grabs and shields, opting for a perry system to maintain a faster pace in gameplay. The developer seems to have a realistic plan that he's serious about completing involving more exciting content that will add to both the multiplayer and single player experience. The game right now has some of the best netplay ive ever seen in a fighting game and even though right now there is only 1v1 matchmaking the developer has confirmed that they are working on having more players in lobbys.\n\nAlready its a great game and i believe it will be even better in the future, its definitely worth 15$ and hours of your time.","September 23, 2015","true","23.9"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

It has an amazing and supportive community, fairly good online tourney scene, and it just feels great to play. Imagine melee, but where all the advanced tech is intentional, so it feels so much smoother. I can't recommend this game to competitive players enough. Do make sure you have a controller though.\n\nThe biggest issue right now; however, is the relatively high learning curve for new players or people unexperienced in platform fighters and a lack of tutorials to counterract this. This can lead to a lot of hate or salt. The thing is, the RoA community majorly counterbalances this, if you need help, you can literally just ask someone like me.","April 10","true","347.5"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Some of the core mechanics are different, like parries instead of shields and grabs, but it's still going to feel pretty familiar if you've played Smash before. What really sets it apart and makes it feel unique is each individual character's design.\n\nThere aren't many characters (6 so far, 2 more on the way), but each one has some kind of mechanic in the form of something they can place somewhere on the stage. Orcane can place a puddle on the ground that he can teleport to or detonate into a pillar of bubbles; Maypul can create a plant that can snare enemies or redirect her projectile; Wrastor can create a horizontal jetstream that he moves faster in, etc. Each character is extremely unique, and it makes the small roster feel a lot bigger than it is.","September 22, 2015","true","13.9"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Easy to pick up and fun to play.\nThis is a very solid game with solid gameplay to boot. While this game is a Smash-esque game, it has a totally different feel. Just as a warning: Do NOT come into this game thinking it's Melee or something. It's not. Refrain from making your layout the exact same as Smash. It might not help.So, first up are the characters: All 6 of the characters (Soon to be 7) are very unique, and while some have similarities to other characters in Smash i.e. Zetterburn is like  Fox and Wolf mixed into one, there are charcters like Kragg who are nothing like other characters in Smash. Everything in this game auto cancelling, meaning that you can preform combos upon combos and they're pretty simple to preform. The online is really good. I never have to wait to long to get a match, and even when I do, I have very little lag. But when there is lag it's ungodly bad. The other thing I feel that I should mention is that the AI is dumb. I don't really bother playing against the AI and stick to Online matches. As of current the single player experience is poor. Get it for online. Finally, I will note the differences. There is not shield, and there is no ledge to grab. Wall jumping can seem a tad alien at first, but it will start to feel more natural as you play more. You also only get one air dodge, so use it wisely.\nTo conclude, this is an amazing game for a good price. I highly recommend it, especially if your a fan of Smash, or if you just want to play a more unique kind of fighting game. Playing this game with friends is also especially fun, but you can only do 1v1 as of current. Have fun and see you in game.","October 31, 2015","true","72.7"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The character designs are all unique and charming in their own way. Each character has their own set of tools to use, and I can't name any "clone" characters on the roster. This game is also an interesting take on the Smash Bros style fighting game (this really should be a named genre instead of just "Smash Clone") in that it has mechanics of its own, such as the Parry. Wavedashing is easier to do than it was in Melee and Project M.\n\nMy only gripe as of now is that the matches against random players online can be laggy, but most of the time the connection is decent.\n\nMy real score is 9/10. The -1 is just because the game isn't finished yet and there is some content I'd really like to see added, such as the two unlockable characters, the single player mode, and other options that are currently unavailable. The fact that these features are added as options but aren't accessible is at least a sign that the devs will deliver on these features.","September 22, 2015","true","20.8"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/palid0r/recommended/383980/","palid0r","palid0r","http://steamcommunity.com/id/palid0r/","82 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI wrote a review on it before saying that the world doesn't need an SSB clone.\n\nWell, I spent more time on it, and it's a charming little game actually.  The music is nice, the stages aren't too bad, and the characters all have their gimmicks.  I can also use my gamecube controll with it.  Also, there's no shield in this game, instead there's a counter(?) mechanic, where if you're hit while dodging (there's a button for it, not just running around), your opponent won't be able to attack and you'll get a free initiate on them within 2 seconds or so.  You can roll, but it's easily punishable.\n\nRight now, there's an abundance of Zetterburns and Kragg(?) players online.  I run into more of them that do the same thing, but that's okay, because they're easy characters to combo with.\n\nBrief overview of the characters.\n\nI'll begin with Orcane, and he's the one I play most.  This guy is a killer whale (orca) with legs.  Why does he need legs?  For kicking ♥♥♥.  His special mechanic is a drop of sludge he can fire and place anywhere on the stage, and also acts as a projectile to disrupt your enemy's recovery, or to provide recovery options via is up-special, or a trap (down-special, and forward-air) that can screw your enemy's approach (This is how you ruin the advance of Zetterburn and Wrastor players since they open with projectiles and dash after it hits).\n\nNext is Zetterburn, if you couldn't guess it, he's all about the fire.  I haven't played him, but there's a lot of them out there.  He's pretty deadly if you let him fight completely on his terms.  He also relies on a DoT mechanic by lighting parts of the stage on fire, and if you are hit by the attacks that do that, or walk into the fire you'll begin to take damage.\n\nHere's Wrastor.  Remember Captain Falcon and Falco from Super Smash Bros?  Well, they got gay and decided to have a love child.  He's a bird with aviator goggles.  His special mechanic is that you launch a tornado, and it leaves a line where your movement is faster in that line after the tornado.  He also accels in air combat, and his strong attacks (think Smash Attack) all require you to be in the air to use.  He also doesn't double jump, he flaps his wings and pentuple jumps.\n\nHow about Maypul?  This is Rocket Raccoon's ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off brother who runs around cutting people with leaves and seeds and ♥♥♥♥.  His brother got to go to space and become friends with a living tree named Groot, while this guy got stuck using his tree pals as weapons.  His mechanic is obviously the trees, you throw seeds onto your enemy, and bait them into your down-special and it wraps them up.  His smash attacks have long distance but not a wide hitbox.  He recovers by holding his up-special to use a vine to jump back up on stage near his enemy.  His down-air (or dair) also spawns a root from the floor of the stage, allowing it to hit anyone on the stage regardless of how far away he is from the ground.\n\nKRAGG!  IF THERE WAS  FIGHTER THAT WOULD YELLING ALL THE TIME AND SOUND OBNOXIOUS, IT BE KRAGG.  HE'S LIKE HERACROSS FROM POKEMON, EXCEPT HE YELLS (not really, but every game has one).  HIS MECHANIC IS HURLING ROCKS AND STUFF AT HIS ENEMIES.  HE THROWS ROCK, ROCK HITS ENEMY, ROCK LANDS ON STAGE.  KRAGG GET ANGRY, HIT ROCK, SHATTERS AND FLIES IN THE DIRECTION IT WAS HIT, GOING ALL OVER ENEMY LIKE A TEENAGER IN A TUBESOCK.  KRAGG FLY OFF STAGE, NO PROBLEM FOR KRAGG.  KRAGG SUMMON ROCK PILLAR ANYWHERE ON THE STAGE.  ALSO GOOD INITIATOR.\n\nLastly, for right now, is Forsburn.  He's a fox who cosplays V for Vendetta.  He has a stealth mechanic, haven't played him much.  He wields a knife and can spawn a doppelganger to confuse your opponent, and can also summon smoke to disappear into, or inhale to become the harbinger of lung cancer (not entirely sure, but I think this is what enables him to make his clone).\n\nBe wary, it is in early access with known bugs, so if you want a flawless game you may be disappointed, but it's fun to play nonetheless.","September 27, 2015","true","6.5"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The fighting games us PC smashers have been waiting for. This game is nothing short of fantastic, even in its early stages. It combines the thrilling and exciting gameplay of Melee with the accessibility of Smash 4, which makes it a perfect medium. The gameplay is smooth, the controls are solid and they even let you change them to your preference. Online is great because it plays out as a best 2/3 set against your opponent (the format in which a majority professional Smash sets are played out).

There are two characters left to be added, Absa and another unknown one. 4 maps are currently in, each with Aether Modes. I think the plan is 8 maps, can't recall.\n\nBeware if you're in Australia or places with terrible internet, you may not have too much fun without local friends to play with.\n\nIt's Great!

It is in many ways a clone of Super Smash Bros. Melee, which I personally haven't spent much time playing, and making a transition to it from Brawl and Smash 4 wasn't that difficult. It is a very fast paced and technical "King of the Hill" typed fighting game where you really do not want to be off stage. This game is worth the price and may eventually be lowered, because there is only one person working on this game alone, Dan Fornace, and we are still waiting for updates.

But this game is fun! Sure it doesn't have next gen graphics, but who cares! That doesn't make a game. Who looks at game such as Smash bros. Melee and says "Man this game's graphics suck! It's no fun at all." If you did, I would slap the side of your face. I mean, really? I see some many great games not getting the credit that they deserve over graphics. Sure there are games out there that are just plain unplayable due to the graphics making it unclear of whats going on, but this game is just simply not one of them. I'm going to make another Melee reference here. Imagine Super Smash. Melee that gets updated and has completely original characters. Thats Rivals of Aether for you. And I can't wait for the full release. I'm really interested in how they'll make the story mode, but most of all, I want to see how big the roster will be, and what new characters they'll add.

Very easy to pick up, hard to master completely. Teaching my friends how to play was a breeze and close matches are pretty much a give in. I've never really been interested in fighting games until RoA.  Balancing in the game has been extremely fair and it feels like most characters get smoother and better with each update, except for the occasional couple of bugs. None of which have been absolutely game breaking for me.\n\nIf you're on the fence, then trust me it won't hurt to try it out. You WILL get sucked into it though, so keep track of your playtime.\n\nIf you have lag issues, try port mapping 1972 and 1973.

With a scant few characters with very little to set them apart from each other and very poor balancing?\n\nRivals of Aether is not one of those games.\n\nRivals is a game designed by and for fans of the SSB franchise who want a platform fighter that plays to the strengths of the more fast-paced and competitive entries in the series, particularly melee. It is built upon the foundation of the competitive melee community, even using a default ruleset that emulates that of melee tournaments (best of 3 sets, set to timed stock matches) and takes many techniques that are central to melee gameplay and encourages them (where the later smash bros games removed them).\n\nThat isn't to say that this game is only for competitive melee players or even for people who enjoy melee - it brings a great deal of new and innovative gameplay concepts to the table by designing each character's moveset specifically around their effects on the stage itself (Wrastor's whirlwind allowing him to move faster and be more dominant, Zetterburn's flames allowing him to lay traps, Orcane's allowing him to move around the stage at will). If you enjoy any of the smash bros games, you should enjoy this.

Melee with online, better features for serious play and a combat system that requires skill and practice to become good at.

For example, Zetterburn is similar to how Fox plays in Melee and Wrastor is similar to how Falco plays (THAT AIN'T FALCO).\n\nIf you come from a Super Smash Bros background, then this will feel right at home. While the game does have a steep learning curve, it is very fun to learn and even more fun to play.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who has played a fighting game before. For people who haven't, I would recommend trying a game similar to this, like any Super Smash Bros game or Brawlhalla (which is free on Steam).\n\nRating: 7.5/10","March 19","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

I have played Smash for like 6 to 7 years now. I think that a PC game that ios the same genre but is different would be better. Here is something you may think is interesting that I didnt know about the game till I played this game at a friends house that makes this game different\n\n1: You cant grab ledges. But they did make the game have more recovery options. Wall jumping is easier and you can airdodge and it wont put you in free fall. Also wall jumping will give you another airdadge (which does nudge you in this game) to another up-special.\n\n2: All of the characters have there own type of ability. Each character feels unique. In smash you will have MArth, Then you have Lucina, same move set just a little different strategy wise. But if you play one character good in THIS game, you have to adapt and get good a different way with the other. Which I love.\n\n3: Last on my list, you also cant shield. I know what your thinking, "MAN DATS LAME MAN, WAZUP Y U GOTTA DOO DAT TOO MEH!" but they added parrying. Parrying is a thing in this game that if you imagine counter from super smash bros. When I say counter you think of Marth, well every character has it but it doesnt automatically hit. Parying freezes your opponent and its like you do the the move. Its like a DIY counter. Thats how i can explain it, you freeze them and for the full second you have you hit them with what ever you can imagine that is fast enough to hit them at that moment. Pretty cool.\n\nSo basically that is what I can tell you I like so far and for those who love the smash community, and love smash, you can do wave-dashing and I think dash dancing in this game and other tricks to. So take my advice this is a game to look at. Hope you enjoyed the review and I will personally give this game a 10 / 10. I highly recommend this game even for non smash players.","October 20, 2015","true","63.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Story mode and other things are coming though. Might redo this review as time passes.\n\nBut for now this is a fun fighting game and deliberately reminiscent of Super Smash Bros., but has some mentionable differences. Most noticeable for me, theres no Block/Shield. You do have a parry though, which does lock your opponent for a moment if timed properly, but this is only rarely doable online, because right now you have to handle lag and thus input delay. That sucks for a fighting game, but might change in the future.\n\nAs for the mechanics themselves: The characters feel good and pretty distinguished. Every fighter has his very own style of moving, fighting and using their special attacks. Controls are, mostly, Smash-Bros-ish. There is DI, there is Aerial Dodge and there even is wavedashing, if your into it. Racking up combos does require some skill, but feels very rewarding so far. This game seems to be supposed to be competitive. No items, only a few environmental hazards and skill oriented gameplay. This might turn out to be a great game in the future, if the updates keep coming and the network-issues get resolved.\n\nUp to this point it is a fairly fun game to kill time with a lot of potential.","September 23, 2015","true","14.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sure It's in Early access, Sure It doesn't have much yet but It soooo good. It also removes those annoying things like edge-grabbing and shielding and replaces shields with a parry technique that if successful will increase the lag of your enemy's attacks allowing you to go for the killing blow. For the Melee/Project M fans; Don't worry, your Air-Dodge and Wave-Dashing is here too.\n\nFor the characters, you will see that similar movesets you would find on other Smash characters like Zetterburn have melee attacks and Up special to Wolf from StarFox, Orcane similar to Vapereon from Smash Land, Kragg having attacks similar to Bowser, Donkey Kong and Sonic and Wrastor with similar attacks to Falco and Captain Falcon. If you are familar with those characters then it might be easier for you to get used to them, as if a slice of home has found you.\n\nAnd unlike Smash 4 (at least in my experience) the online is not ♥♥♥♥♥♥ but you only do 1v1s which is fine because that's what I do anyway.\n\nIf you love Smash then you will love this.\n\n\n\nAlso if my Friends are reading this: Buy it, I want friends to play with....\n\n\n\nIt gets lonely.","September 23, 2015","true","17.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The fighting itself is fun, and 3 stock matches end quickly. Parrying, Directional airdodges that don't put you into freefall, and walljumping for all characters serve to differentiate rivals from smash . The music, however, isn't memorable and could be described as "generic." The character sprites aren't very detailed or big, making jabs look more like small dashes of pixels than an arm punching. This is my biggest gripe with the game as of now. My last complaint is a lack of online lobbies and the inability to choose what stage you want when playing online. I'm sure the online will improve with time though.

Each character has a game-changer ability or two that can modify the playing field, from obscuring vision, teleportation, to adding additional blocks and platforms. These strong abilities definitely create a creative space to play around with how best to combo and mixup opponents. The online matches are best of 3 and you can find a new opponent after a set, which is so much better than dropping out in smash 4 every time you want a fresh opponent.

It just works so well. Basically, it's Super Smash Bros. Melee but with more opportunity for combos.\n\nOne of the biggest things I like is the movement. You are barely limited and can easily turn and dash. Also, there's wavedashing. The wavedashing is really awesome.\n\nMy current problem is Forsburn.

Each character has a game-changer ability or two that can modify the playing field, from obscuring vision, teleportation, to adding additional blocks and platforms. These strong abilities definitely create a creative space to play around with how best to combo and mixup opponents. The online matches are best of 3 and you can find a new opponent after a set, which is so much better than dropping out in smash 4 every time you want a fresh opponent. As well the net code seems to be a lot more responsive than smash.

Melee with online, better features for serious play and a combat system that requires skill and practice to become good at. The game has an original roster of characters (even though there isn't that many right now) who all have different moves. Some of them could also be compared to characters from Melee. For example, Zetterburn is similar to how Fox plays in Melee and Wrastor is similar to how Falco plays (THAT AIN'T FALCO).\n\nIf you come from a Super Smash Bros background, then this will feel right at home. While the game does have a steep learning curve, it is very fun to learn and even more fun to play.\n\nI would recommend this to anyone who has played a fighting game before. For people who haven't, I would recommend trying a game similar to this, like any Super Smash Bros game or Brawlhalla (which is free on Steam).\n\nRating: 7.5/10","March 19","true","10.7"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sparx21/recommended/383980/","Sparx21","Sparx21","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sparx21/","40 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nI will say this, Rivals of Aether is my favorite Steam game as of right now. And the fact that it’s still in early access speaks for itself. With 195 hours logged in, as well as a decently high ranking on the NA PR, I decided that it’s finally time that I write a review.\n\nFor those of you that don’t know, Rivals of Aether is a platform-based fighter, similar to that of Super Smash Bros. However, each character has something ridiculous about them that totally wouldn't fly in your average Smash game. Certain gameplay mechanics such as parrying instead of shields, the lack of ledges and the lack of grabs allow for a much more aggresive playstyle than that of Smash. Some people aren’t a huge fan of this, which I can understand. Personally, I like going ham, and this game can definitely support that.\n\nProbably my favorite thing about this game is the characters. Each character provides a very different, unique playstyle, which is way more than I can say for Smash. Besides that, as I said before each character has something ridiculous about them. However, the characters are very balanced, and every character is viable. This allows for a very interesting play on the battlefield.\n\nIn terms of stages, they are all very well done. Each play a different role in counter-picking, and should definitely be worth considering. Speaking of counter-picking, it’s worth mentioning that the local play mode has a striking system similar to that of Project M. So this allows for a better counter-picking system when participating in tournaments.\n\nMy only complaint is actually about that striking system. I have no complaints about it, except that it’s only in the local play mode. I would like it if this was in the online mode as well, or to be more exact, when playing online with friends. This allows for better practice on certain stages during friendlies, and allows for counter-picks during online tournaments.\n\nLast but not least, a word for Dan. KEEP IT UP! This game is incredible, and I’m sure that you will do good for the game with every patch. And although I’m sure you’ve already got a plan for the 8th stage, I think it would be cool if we had a stage with no platforms, considering that’s something that every character has relied on in some way possible. If you’re already doing that, then good on you!\n\nAs for the reader, thanks for reading! This is definitely a game you should put on your wishlist at the very least, but keep in mind that once this game is out of early access, the price will rise! This is most likely the cheapest time that you’ll be able to get the game, so I’d try to get it ASAP. With that, I bid you farewell, and good luck on the battlefield!","March 22","true","302.1"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","3"

I don't mean that the game is bad, it's just online is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. You will exclusively find people that either play Zetterburn, Orcane, Wrastor and Kragg. "Why?", You may be thinking. Well, let me explain...\nThings Zetterburn has:\nGood juggling\nA stun thing that throws you into the nth demension\nOther OP stuff Things Orcane has:\nGood juggling\nLots of teleporting moves\nOther OP stuff Things Wrastor has:\nGood juggling\nEven more juggling\nOther OP stuff Things Kragg has:\nGood juggling\nAmazing recovery\nOther OP stuff\nObviously, there are 2 things that they all have in common: good juggling and OP stuff. So far, I have only played against people who play these characters and never let me do anything because I am always in the air with Wrastors talons up my ♥♥♥♥. By the way, other OP stuff means even more juggling. Dan Fornace seriously needs to balance these 4 characters because I have yet to see Maypul and Forsburn not used by bots. There is actually a reason I haven't seen them, and that links back to earlier. The reason is that they don't have any or good enough juggling to be paired up against the other 4 characters. However, I reckon that Dan is busy working on ways to make Maypul and Forsburn viable or the others less viable.\nDespite all this, I highly recommend this game to everyone in this galaxy, the next one over and the one after that (but not any further). Even though it's early access, I haven't had too many issues with the game other than Wrastor, Zetterburn, Orcane, Kragg and occasional lag spikes when I'm playing online. Actually, no, they aren't just lag spikes, there ♥♥♥♥ing lag eternities that happen alot. I don't want to have to suicide 3 times just becasue I have massive lag because I have to play with some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in the Bemuder Triagle. But, the game is good, it just need that to be fixed by letting people play with other people who are in the same universe as them.

I suck at Melee. My Marth struggles to move fluidly and can't even combo spacies 1/1000 as well as M2K. But I sure can wavedash.\nRivals of Aether (ROA) is a  platform fighter that's heavily based off of the Smash Brothers franchise, but it has its own elements that make ROA very different, such as the lack of shields and ledges to name a few. I also believe that this games development is fully considering the competetive players. That's not to say that casual players such as a group of friends or family won't find it fun, as the core mechanics are easy enough to learn but hard enough to master to get the balance between ease and skill ceiling.\nIn my opinion, this game sits in the middle of Melee and Smash4, the two most played games of Smash Bros. It has the ability to become technical at times where combo heavy characters can flourish, like in Melee. But, there is also a much higher need for careful thinking before acting, like in Smash4. The recent inclusion of ranked play with leaderboards makes winning and losing count many times more than before. Finally, the ability for almost any controller or keyboard to connect and work is an absolute joy. I would not have bought this game if I could not use my GameCube controller with it (which will work with adapters, including Nintendo's. Just Google how to make it work.)\nAs for bugs and glitches, I can say only once has my game crashed and the bugs that I have not encountered are being taken out by the dedicated dev team.\nOverall ROA sits comfortably as my favorite fighter to play (Melee and Smash4 still hold my eye for viewing) and I look forward to seeing the community grow both online and at tournaments.","May 25","true","17.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Definitely an amazing pick up if you love Smash Bros! It has its own elements that can make it a completely different game and is a very interesting take and play style to the Smash Bros. series. Excellent soundtrack and pixel art created by great indie developers. The soundtrack has a very SNES feel to it, and heavily resembles the MapleStory soundtrack to me. Overall, an excellent fighting game and has native support for Xbox 360 & PS3 controllers, with also a way to play with a GameCube controller. Highly recommend to any Smash Bros. fan or even fighting games in general!","October 1, 2015","true","33.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

If your a fan of Super Smash Bros, this game will provide a refreshing difference in playstyle. If you're not a Smash fan, then try out this game. It's a fun fighting game, that once you get into it, has a pretty balanced roster of characters and great competative play.\n\nThe only con that I have with this game is lag issue.

I can also happily say that this is my favourite early access game on steam right now. SURE, the game is so similiar to smash bros to the point that the only difference between the two, is the characters and the upcoming game modes, "Story mode" and "Abyss mode", but I still love this game for what it is.\n\nOk, so let me start off by stating why I love this game. Well obviously, I love the fact that it has smash bros style fighting but fixes most of the things that I do not like about smash bros. For example, in smash bros there is such a big cast of characters that I feel like they waste a lot of awesome characters and also the moves in smash bros feel... well, boring.  WATCH OUT, SMASH BROS FANS INCOMINGGGGGG\nAnyway, apart from that I quite like the characters, variety in maps, interactivity in maps and the fact that it has all the basic needs for a fighting game such as controller support (because who uses keyboards?), local multiplayer, online multiplayer and plain old singleplayer. It is also quite easy to find an online match (most of the time).\n\nNow I will be picking apart the game, and noting all the problems. Well I couldn't find much, but the one or two that I did find were quite significant and need a lot of work. First of all the character balancing needs to be worked on. Wrastor and Etalus are two characters who are quite OP and can dominate all the other characters. Well that is if you exclude the insanely over-powered Zetterburn. This character will absolutely wreck you, even if you are very good. He is also very easy to use for a beginner. This sucks because everyone online loves to use him and therefore it just isn't fun to play online. Another big problem was the CPU. Ok so right now the highest difficulty level for the CPU is level 9. For someone who doesn't own neither smash bros OR a Wii U, and has only played smash bros a couple of times, I look like a proffesional against the CPU. Honestly using nearly any character, against a level 9 Zetterburn, I can within... at most like 90 seconds. My point is that because the CPU is so easy and the multiplayer is unbalanced and unfair, this game loses some of it's fun. Finally, a tiny complaint, which will probably be added when the game leaves early access, is that there are no achievements. I think that even if they added a couple, it would make playing the game a bit more fun.\n\nAlthough there are big negatives to this game, there is also a very nice local multiplayer, and a nice singleplay with very nice game modifiers. Overall I think that these problems may not be around once the game is fully released however, either way, this game is definitely worth your money.\n\n\n7.5/10\n\nPros:\n-Similar to Smash bros, but also manages to be better\n-Singleplayer, local multiplayer and online multiplayer\n-Very cool, nice characters\n-Very nice maps with absolutely great and simple elements of interactivity\n-More cool upcoming game modes such as Story mode and Abyss mode\n\nCons:\n-Characters are unbalanced\n-CPU is quite easy (for me, tell me what you think?)\n\n\n\n\n\nOh, and if you would like some free game keys, join my group (I'm a mod):\nAccidently Reviewed  Was this review helpful or maybe even not helpful?

While it does borrow the same percentage/KO system from smash bros, the gameplay is a new animal entirely (no pun intended). No characters can grab the ledge, yet all can wall-jump, making recovery much more interesting and dangerous. No landing lag, allowing for a 0% to KO combos provided you don't miss any oppoprtunities. Unlike smash, you do not have any shield, and you can't grab. Instead, you "parry," Which is nothing like smash's defensive play at all. So far, Inturrupting a combo stream with a well timed parry is extremely satisfying.\n\nIf you are a fan of super smash bros (especially Melee and project M) I cannot recommend this highly enough.

While it does borrow the same percentage/KO system from smash bros, the gameplay is a new animal entirely (no pun intended). No characters can grab the ledge, yet all can wall-jump, making recovery much more interesting and dangerous. No landing lag, allowing for a 0% to KO combos provided you don't miss any oppoprtunities. Unlike smash, you do not have any shield, and you can't grab. Instead, you "parry," Which is nothing like smash's defensive play at all. So far, Inturrupting a combo stream with a well timed parry is extremely satisfying.\n\nIf you are a fan of super smash bros (especially Melee and project M) I cannot recommend this highly enough. It was made by a smash bros fan with smash bros fans in mind. However, there are some things you should know. This is a competitive game. It does not have the party gimmicks (items and final smash moves). It's made to be a sport. Also, we're still missing 2 characters and the entire story mode.

Things are going to improve and be changed in the future.\n\nAs an avid Smash fan, I was extrememly excited for RoA. I even signed up for the beta and played the alpha builds a long time ago. To my unpleasant surprise, not much has changed.\n\nMost of the game feels 'tacky' and rather lazy. The amount of options doesn't come close to matching up with flash projects such as Super Smash Flash or the like. The game has a very limited set of defensive options that don't allow for any creative leeway. That said, there's new mechanics, and they are interesting. Instead of implumenting a defensive shield-based system, Dan opted for a parry system. That's fine, new things ina 'Smash' scenario sound awesome.\n\nThe biggest problem is that the game has is it's way to defensive. The way the parrys work currently creates a heavy 'run in, do a combo string, then run the hell away' gameplan. Rinse and repeat.\n\nAfter my time with the game it seems that the neutral is less about creativity and interesting approaches/follow ups and more about who messes up first and get's punished first. The footsies in the game are rediculious, and I'm sad the game is primarily that. I would have moved to have a better balance between character's defensive and offensive options.\n\nAs for reccomending this game, it's iffy. If you like Smash Bros. and have played it for years, I don't reccommend this. The design philosophy will feel foreign to you. For other crowds that want to get into fighting games, this might be a nice stepping stone to start with.","September 29, 2015","false","11.3"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

The recent which was supposed to add more controller-support did the opposite. None of my gamepads would work on D-Input on X-Input they were recognized as being 2 moving simultanously. When I got one to work the mapping was mad wrong, trying to remap my buttons just resulted in the game crashing.\nAfter all this game is not worth it, buy Guilty Gear Xrd or Ultra Street Fighter 4 if you are interested in Fighting games.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spellox/recommended/383980/","spellox","Spellox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spellox/","85 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n(Word of warning, I'm gonna use some Smash terms)\nAs someone who is a semi competitive Melee and PM player, this game really clicks with me. If you play Melee and PM at a high level, you can probably pick up a character in an hour or two. If you're a competitive Melee or PM player, you can probably pick up a character in an hour or two.\n\n\nThis game is ACCESSIBLE\nThe gameplay is fast and smooth, and incredibly user friendly. The learning curve is lessened from Smash due to the lack L-Cancelling, replacing it with low landing lag, making combos smooth and easier to perform. There aren't edges to the stages, making edge-guarding less read based, but, the wall jumping and air dodging lets you mix up your recoveries just enough to keep opponents guessing, but not to the point where you could do 3-4 different things recovering. Also, you can attack and move out of an air-dodge, which makes a missed wavedash off the stage less punishing. There aren't any shields in Rivals. Instead, you have parrying, which keeps defensive play to a minimum.\n\nI haven't even talked about the characters yet.\n\nWow.\n\nEvery character is completely unique, with really well executed ideas. Zetterburn can set opponents on fire, and if he connects a strong attack (the non copywritten name for smash attacks) while the opponent is still on fire, the attack does quite a good deal more knockback and damage (Try aerial side-b into F-smash ;) ). Wrastor is the godlike combination of Falco, Marth, and Jigglypuff. He utilizes a wind current that, if he is inside it, raises his speed and his already insane aerial speed. He also has 4 jumps, so, uh.\n\nBACK AIR BACK AIR BACK AIR.\n\nAnyways, Forsburn can create a clone of himself (ICs anyone?) and can create smoke, store it, and use it to create an explosion around him. He can also Ken combo. Orcane uses a puddle that he creates somewhere on the map. He can teleport to it, make it evaporate into bubble has a trap, and enhance some moves of his. Maypul is an extremely small and fast character that can mark opponents with certain special moves. If she uses a strong attack while the person is marked, they are stunned for a small amount of time, which is a really simple kill setup. If the opponent is marked and she up-Bs, she will pull herself toward the opponent, and control her direction, which is great for mixups. Kragg hits quite hard, but is a good deal slower that the rest of the cast. He can create a big stone that he can throw in a myriad of directions. If he isn't holding it, he can break with an attack, which sends a bunch of rocks in the direction he attacked. Depending on what attack you use and what direction you hit it at. His up-B is really bizarre, he summons a pillar of stone wherever he is. It's really useful for comboing, by getting an opponent between Kragg and the pillar opens tons of combo opportunities.\n\nSo, is this game worth buying? Yes, absolutely, One of the greatest games in early access right now.\n\nHope to see you online!","October 4, 2015","true","12.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I throughoutly enjoy this game a lot. I like how smooth it is, how the combos can be pulled, and how quick and fast paste this game is, all characters are balanced (everyones op) and the online does have some issues with lag, but that mostly happens when your opponent has a bad connection or is playing lower then 60 fps (thats from what I herd). this game is very fun, you will loose a lot but the more you loose the better you get at the game, just dont get mad from loosing and actually examine why you lost, apart from that, is a great game, I feel like games like this should get their own category called Brawler. the only problem I have with this game is the music for the stupid water level, I think its the most annoying song they have.\n\nalso all the people that post negative reviews I have this to say to you\n\nGit Gud","September 27, 2015","true","28.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I throughoutly enjoy this game a lot. I like how smooth it is, how the combos can be pulled, and how quick and fast paste this game is, all characters are balanced (everyones op) and the online does have some issues with lag, but that mostly happens when your opponent has a bad connection or is playing lower then 60 fps (thats from what I herd). this game is very fun, you will loose a lot but the more you loose the better you get at the game, just dont get mad from loosing and actually examine why you lost, apart from that, is a great game, I feel like games like this should get their own category called Brawler. the only problem I have with this game is the music for the stupid water level, I think its the most annoying song they have.\n\nalso all the people that post negative reviews I have this to say to you\n\nGit Gud","September 27, 2015","true","28.7"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The game is complex but interesting and have a fair amount of character diversity to make the experience enjoyable. Compared to brawlhalla this game has the better formula, but it suffers from some major lag issues. Make sure to play this game with an ethernet cable at all times and if you play online watch the ping of the other player. If their ping isn\'t yellow don\'t bother playing them or else your match will be plagued with input lag.\n\nAethetically, the game isn\'t too pleasing and seems like an retro game (guess this appeals to some people), but if you\'re willing to overlook the oldschool graphics you have a whirlwind of fun coming at you. It is obvious this game isn\'t in full release which is evident in the limited online play. Currently, online is limited to only one vs. one as opposed to brawlhalla\'s typical four to eight player free for all. Hopefully the devs can fix the lag issue and improve the game\'s net code.\n\nIf you compare this game\'s characters to that of brawlhalla, brawlhalla has the larger roster. ROA\'s character roster may be smaller but every character feels unique and have their own unique move-sets. On the otherhand Brawlhalla\'s character slection is based a select seof weapons and every character have similar move-sets.\n\nWith all that being said, this game is exetremely promising and it\'s your go to game to get your fighting-game-fix. I recommend the game, but be warned that the game definately feels incomplete in its current form.","June 1","true","5.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","1","0","0"

But I cannot recommend this game as it has some serious flaws.\n\n1. The netcode is atrocious and is not anywhere near appropriate for a fighting game. Inputs get dropped, input delay changes on the fly, and each player will experience lag differently. I have fought many times where the player I was fighting was getting lag and input drops but I didn't feel a thing, and vice versa.\n2. The characters are way too gimmicky. This is very fun when you first play the game and you get to see how unique each character is, but eventually it becomes boring and turns into "each character has one play style and X number of auto/near auto combos you must do to be competitive."\n3. Due to the character gimmicks, the game is mostly about hard counters. It feels like most matchups are 7/3. For example, Zetteburn v Kragg is ridiculously in Kraggs favor.\n4. At an advanced level, combos can be cool, but in order to be newbie friendly, way too many simple and boring combos exist that feel cheap, especially when you miss a tech due to online delay. I'm specifically referring to Forsburn and Zetteburn sprint spam, Wrastor bair spam, Forsburn and Zetteburn uair & fair spam. You end up seeing and using the same combos over and over and over because they work. Originality only has a place in the very top % of players.\n5. The parry mechanic is an original idea with a terrible implementation. Parry is spammable, and landing a parry vs a player at a high % is essentially a guaranteed kill.\n\nIt's early access, these issues can be fixed. I'll update my review accordingly if the issues do get fixed. But for the time being, I'm putting this game down. The frustration of dealing with the subpar netcode and lack of balance vastly outweighs any fun.","November 25, 2015","false","96.6"," 10 of 23 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","10","23","0","0"

Full of problems and things to be improved on, but fun. Rivals of aether truly puts the "really early" in "early access", or at least i hope. The game needs a ton of stuff added and improved on before it can be considered even close to a releasable game. we'll do a pros cons list cause we're Hip\n\nPros:\n-great combat, tight controls\n-characters feel unique with their own gimmicks that feel extremely satisfying to pull off *cough orcane cough*\n-pretty background art\n-extremely fast to get into a game\n\nCons:\n-character designs are for the most part god awful\n-wow i've never seen a FIRE LION before\n-obligatory bird character with goggles\n-a dolphin with meaty legs\n-a dolphin with meaty legs\n-a dolphin with meaty legs\n-lack of characters and stages (early access duh)\n-can't play in full screen (only me? i don't know)\n-the online. two of my hours on this game were spent trying to get it to work properly. its mostly because my computer is weird and only has a monitor refresh rate of 48hz. everything runs smoothly and looks fine on my end, but my opponents must have experienced extreme input lag, which would mean they just suicided three times to get to a different match. in order for me to play i had to mess around with my computers settings and disable vsync and mess with other stuff and play in windowed mode. this needs to be fixed, no one should have to mess with their pc settings and settle for less than ideal conditions just to play the game\n-lack of communication. the above would have probably been figured out way faster if there was chat in the end game screen or something\n-lack of competitive matchmaking. the player base of this game currently is probably something like 75% super smash bros veterans and 25% people who heard about the game and decided to give it a shot. learning the game is difficult when you get three stocked over and over by some zetterburn main and you can't get a hit in. matchmaking would probably solve this: either all the try hard git good players play competitive and are matched against same level people and would be happy not playing against noobs and the baddies like me get to practice in normals, or people keep tryharding in normals so baddies like me go to matchmaking and practice at the ♥♥♥♥ tier where we belong until we git good\n\n\nmy cons list looks huge in comparison, but overall i do think the game is really something special. i just hope that the developers care enough about the cons i've listed to fix them and make this the great game it could be. if this game gets fully released as the game we all want it to grow up to be, expect tournaments, youtube content, professional players, guides, fanart, etc. because this is unlikely to be something that dies out quickly if its good. if you think your computer might have issues running the game, please wait for the devs to make it more reliable\n\n\nTL;DR: game's fun. it has a really really long way to go though\n\n((a dolpin with meaty legs))\n\n(((thats just hilariously bad)))","October 6, 2015","true","10.7"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

I really wish I could I love the game but it seems like the devs have no idea how they actually want to balance the game. Every update tries to balance characters in "meaningful" ways yet always seem to fall short. I wanted balance in my previous review but I was sadly wrong to believe that it would fix the game in any way possible.\n\nMost of my past issues have been resolved though, you can now see other players ping before commiting to a match online. Leaderboard is nice along with the ranking system, I really want to reccomend this game. But again every update changes the meta drastically (Sm4shish updates) there is really no reason to put any work into the game at this point if characters are going to change this much.\n\nFinal words\nTaken from the Wrastor patch notes:\n\n"For Wrastor, we are still trying to balance him out by removing reliance on Tornado and spreading out his KO potential elsewhere."\n\nWhen a character has a gimmick isn't normal for them to rely on said gimmick much like the other characters of the cast rely on theirs?\n\n\n\n\nOLD REVIEW\nAt the current state of the game (0.0.3) while being a great game, I cannot recommend it as the online has unbearable input lag in half of the online matches, online being a big selling point for many people.\n\nAs you may or may not know, this game is heavily inspired by Super Smash Bros. but more specifically Melee. Veterans of Smash will already be accustomed to most concepts this game has and will quickly adapt to the slight changes made from Melee. But for players who have never played Melee or Smash in general will be quickly alienated in the online, advanced techniques from Melee like Wavedashing and Teching are in the game and can change the flow of matches quite quickly. At some point I personally think that the Dev should include some sort of tutorial, when the game has been fleshed out enough, to introduce these concepts to players.\n\nFor actual gameplay the game is solid in nearly every aspect possible. Most characters are well balanced (Aside from Maypul and Zetterburn in most cases) and have amazing designs choices for gameplay. With two more characters on the way I hope to see the roster grow even more, possibly to the point that the game will be balanced enough to never have 20XX associated with it.\n\nThe sound track and stage design are both spot on and are extremely memorable, I hope that later stages can keep with this trend. Stages have two different types, Aether and Basic, with one being marketed more towards casual party play and the other for the competetive crowd (The greatest choice ever made). With story mode coming out soon™ I openly welcome changes to nearly everything.\n\n\nTl;dr: Fix online, balance characters a bit, and more everything!","September 26, 2015","false","54.1"," 64 of 136 people (47%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","47","64","136","5","1"

It is still an early access game and I'm aware this isn't the final product, but so far, from a noobs perspective, there is not much reason for me to enjoy playing this game besides the fact that now i can play Smash on my pc.

This game wants to be like melee, but instead it gets dumbed down so badly that games come down to gimmicks. All the interesting elements about melee are removed and instead gimmicks are added. Character balancing is horrible, seems like all the characters are just balanced to their max potential, this means that at lower levels the balance is horrible. Online barely works and it seems the developer cares more about advertising than dev costs.","October 29, 2015","false","8.5"," 15 of 36 people (42%) found this review helpful","42","15","36","0","0"

Sorry bethesda.\n\nPlaying with a fightstick i ran into the game still recognising stick imput ghosting, Hold stick right and let go it will still keep going for a few milliseconds after release even causing you to run off ledges right when the game starts if you just let it do its thing, i was able to recreate this problem 36/50 tries, it even does the same with the cursor in character select.\n\nOnly 2 people fighting at a time, for this kind of game i was hoping for 4 player combat.\n\nBecause of the way the controlls of the game work its alot of work to even position yourself properly to even hit your enemy and with most of the moves having these delays, just missplacing yourself out of reach to hit your enemy, a problem i haven't had in any fighting game including smash itself,\n\nPlaying a game is supposed to bring you excitement and you enjoy playing them, but with this all im getting is dissapointment that i wasted $15 on a game i probably would never play again based on its lackluster and barely working mechanics.","March 7","false","8.6"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stalegren/recommended/383980/","stalegren","Stale Gren","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stalegren/","7 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nAs a competitive Smash Bros player(#2 in my country) I think this game is insanely bad and I'm saying this because I've put 90+ hours into it. At first people think it's amazing and I also thought so but after around 30 hours you start to realize the game's issues. Bad mechanics, extremely bad character design and weird stages. Wouldn't recommend to anyone.\n\nIt DOES feel like a good game at first, don't get me wrong. But once you realize it's weaknesses you'll regret buying it and probably go back to Smash as soon as possible.\n\nOkay, I can elaborate.\n\nBad mechanics:\n\nParry: Parry is a fighting game mechanic and it's good in some games such as Street Fighter series or Pokken, where it actually works. In a platform fighter like RoA however, it doesn't work. It's basically powershield but worse because smallest mistake can lead to a 0-death combo. If you're playing Smash 4, you know Bayonetta has a similar move called Witch Time which is essentially RoA parry. You know what happened when they added that move to Smash 4? Everyone got crazy over it and now they're considering actually banning Bayonetta because she has a parry. That's how BAD parry is in a platform fighter game. In these kind of games(RoA, Smash 4 etc.) there are moves which are high risk high reward, and low risk low reward. In Smash games, there are shields and if you commit to a low reward move, you'd expect to get punished lightly. But if you commit to a high reward move and get shielded, you'd expect to get punished heavily. In RoA, parry completely ♥♥♥♥♥ on this balance and makes every move high risk, because parrystun is the same even if the move is a high risk move, or a low risk move. This essentially makes the game extremely defensive, to the point where whoever hits first might get punished too heavily so both players would have to play too carefully. I don't see a high-level future for this game simply because of this mechanic.\nRandom meteor hitboxes: For the sake of making some characters go for crazy hype  meteors and stuff, all hitboxes that goes downwards were given a meteor hitbox. This makes characters like Zetterburn(up-b) or Kragg(nair) meteor the other characters randomly for no reason. Completely unintentionally too. This isn't too much of a big deal but I'd expect a fighting game to be a little more consistent. I like examples of games where you do things and those things work as you meant. In RoA that isn't the case.\n\nBad character design:\n\nAbsa and Orcane:The developer seems to be confused about how the game should be played. He makes zoning heavy characters that punishes approaches, then realizes these characters slows down the game and nerfs them. Shuts down what they have and makes them unusable in high level play. Absa got nerfed twice, and Orcane got nerfed three times. Their zoning tools got nerfed heavily, for no reason. These characters' movesets and designs all compliment to a zone-heavy defensive gameplan. Then he weakens them and buffs other tools they have to make them play more offensively. It doesn't make sense. Very bad design choices by dan fornace. (They should've stood the way they were)\n\nKinda tired of typing, I'll type more later.","March 22","false","92.7"," 9 of 25 people (36%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","36","9","25","0","5"

So it's easy to win:\nStep 1: learn a good combo\nStep 2: practice it\nStep 3: do it\nStep 4: do it again and again, because your enemy can't do ♥♥♥♥ about that\nStep 5: YOU WIN\nSimple as that. Good enough for you ? if not, don't buy it for the online, because it's good enough for the players online...","March 1","false","4.0"," 0 of 7 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","7","0","4"

It's not that it has a learning curve, it's only that online is terrible in its current state and it's only that all the characters can be COMPLETELY (yes, completely) overpowered by one character. Then when you try to learn, you get destroyed by the lag in online, and don't think, "Oh, then i'll just play offline with bots and get better that way."

The game is too easy to cheese and be good at, especially with how awful the online netcode is. Lag is a constant feature, and every character is too gimmicky to be worth it, just spam their special moves and eventually you win. The easiest way to win against anyone 1 on 1 is to simply sit underneath a platform, poke through with your moves and specials, and parry any attempt to attack you. There is literally no way to approach a campy and defensive playstyle with most characters. The characters are just bad rehashes of Super Smash Brothers characters, moves and all. And the characters that are most viable are simply the ones who can win off of two hits, special or otherwise.

If you haven't already practiced good movement in a Smash game then it will be rather hard to understand how to play this game for some newer players since being able to actually move out of the way of things is the best defense you can have in this game right now. Great game to play with your friends but I don't really enjoy it as of right now from this glaring mechanic oversight.\n\nMaybe this was a bit too critical but "I" don't enjoy it THEREFORE I will not recommend it.\n\nThe game is definitely not hard.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shapechanger/recommended/383980/","shapechanger","Shapechanger","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shapechanger/","511 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nWant to experience the worst netcode in the history of online gaming? Do you enjoy balance philosophy that revolves around the phrase "wouldn't it be cool if"? Then look no father!\n\nLet me just start off by saying that I've been looking forward to this game for a long time. I was a frequent tournament-goer for Super Smash Bros. Melee years back, and after watching Nintendo ♥♥♥♥ up the following two entries in the series, I'm sure there were plenty of people like me who were excitedly anticipating a game in the same vein that was actually designed to be competitive. But alas, the excitement did not last long. But hey, let's start with what's good.\n\nPros:\n- The art style and sound design are pretty freaking great. There's obviously been a lot of love poured into the character sprites and animations and you can really feel it. The stages in kind are wonderfully detailed, especially that giant plant who will ruin your day repeatedly on the treetop level. The music and sound effects all fit in with the aesthetic are are really a treat most of the time. My only complaint here is that some things are just a little too similar to Smash Bros. to the point where it feels less like "inspiration" and more like "copy paste".\n\n- The game (at least when it's offline) runs just as smooth as you would hope it does. It's easy to link attacks together to create dynamic combos just like you would in Smash Bros. Landing lag is virtually non-existent so the game maintains a very fast pace that is certainly tailored to the preferences of Melee players like me. It's great.\n\nOkay, now let's move on.\nCons:\n- The netcode. Holy ♥♥♥♥ is it bad. It's like Super Smash Bros. Brawl all over again. If you want to get good at this game, you better learn how to play through a soft delay at minimum to 3+ second input lag at worst. Matches that actually feel smooth are so rare that when you finally get into one you'll start playing badly because you'll be so used to the lag. And with no way of seeing your opponent's ping before a match, you have no way of filtering your matches. "Early Access" isn't an excuse at this point when so many other Early Access games, especially ones like this that are born for online play, have near perfect netcode right out of the gate. But hey, maybe I'm just spoiled by the buttery smoothness of Rising Thunder's dream netcode.\n\n- Parrying. There are actually some huge key differences between this game and Smash Bros. that chance the way you play the game pretty radically. Number one is that there is no blocking or grabbing. That system is replaced entirely by parrying. Now on paper it seems like a good way to make the game a lot more aggressive and keep characters that would otherwise be way too safe on their toes. On paper. In application parrying makes the more defensive zone-control characters even more powerful than they would be if they just had a shield or even just a spot dodge. Why? Because unlike parries or perfect blocks in other games that just give you a frame advantage, a successful parry in Rivals of Aether puts your opponent in a stun state that allows you to counter attack. This effectively means that unless you opponent is being juggled, using ground attacks is suicide because you will simply be parried and destroyed. It doesn't bother Wrastor too much due to his heavy aerial emphasis, but it screws over every other aggressive character and turns fights between defensive characters into an even slower affair where both sides are afraid to go in for the kill because one parry and they could be dead. It's a huge example of "cool idea, terrible execution".\n\n- There are no ledges and instead everybody gets one wall jump that also resets their up special. This, just like parrying, was clearly an attempt to make the game more exciting and aggressive but actually ends up removing a substantial amount of depth from the game. Now if you haven't played Smash Bros., ledges are, as you might expect, the corners of the stage where characters could traditionally "latch" onto. This meant that everybody's recovery was in practice a little bit better than it seemed because you didn't have to get back onto the stage, just to the ledge. But the ledge was more than that. Because it also gave you a brief window of invulnerability, it served as an analogue to the "wake up" scenario in many traditional fighting games. Just like in wake up situations, the disadvantaged player has decision priority and must make the correct decision to get back into a more nuetral position, whereas the advantaged player is trying to guess that decision and punish it. Rival of Aether's wall jump reset replacement accomplishes almost none of the same depth that ledges provided, and instead creates a situation in many matchups where the recovering player has such a ridiculously limited range of options that recovering is not a matter of outplaying your opponent but instead simply hoping that they make a huge mistake, and that's never good design.\n\nNow, as with all Early Access games, there's always room for improvement, and maybe, in time, these issues will be improved upon, but at the time of this review, I simply cannot recommend this game at all, even if you are a Smash Bros. fan. By all means, hit that "Follow" button to keep an eye on this game's progress, but don't fork out your dough yet.","September 23, 2015","false","0.9"," 17 of 61 people (28%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","28","17","61","0","2"

Melee. However, don't think it is.\nThe game has 7 characters currently, #8 will be coming sometime next year, and DLC is a possibility.\nUnlike in Smash Bros. there are no items. This isn't a bad thing though, because this game is very "Meta-based".\nThis game is designed to be competitive and isn't about playing casually, not to say you shouldn't. Because hopping into a 4-player 4 stock match is still a lot of fun. But the facts are that the game is heavily based upon competitive viability.\nThe online, despite what other reviews will say isn't actually that bad, there's gonna be a few laggy matches here and there, but the community of RoA players completely understand if you jump off the stage and then find a new opponent. So overall the online isn't bad.\nThe game has a developer mode, where you can edit character specifics and such, damage, knockback, hitboxes etc. and it's really useful maybe you think one of a character's moves is lacking (In my opinion there aren't any, but I'm using this just as an example,) then you can edit it and make it just right for you. Dev mode can only be used offline.\nNow, there's a lot of gameplay things I need to list. So, I'll just make a short list of pros and cons.\nPros:\n-Smooth gameplay.\n-No character is "O.P."\n-Every stage (In "Basic" mode) is viable for competitive.\n-Melee techs (Wavedashing, Dash dancing, Wavelanding and a few others.)\n-You just hit an aerial, and it felt GOOD. You just hit a smash attack, and it felt GOOD. (What I'm trying to say is, everything feels good to hit. Nothing feels underwhelming.)\nCons:\n-Online trolls. You'll see a few of these.\n-No menu music.\n-No turbo mode. (This is more of just a feature that should be in every smash bros game. Not really a con, I still want it though.)\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYou can't grab or grab ledge. You can't shield, instead it is replaced with a "Parry" which is like a counter, if you successfuly parry a hit, you get a period of invincibility and the opponent is frozen.\nPractise (or practice if you're 'Murican) mode is very useful, it has frame advance and has an option to show hitboxes. You can make the cpu's DI perfect, or in various directions. And you can make the CPU tech in various directions also. Very useful if you want to get better at the game.","October 14, 2015","true","148.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

My first review on this account (Which is basically my 5th review, since this is basically my new old account [Oh, did I miscount? What? I've only done 3 reviews on my old account? READ PEOPLE'S DESCRIPTIONS DAMN YOU!!].), and I'm doing it on an indie game that goes by the name of Rivals of Aether.\n\n**** KRAGG\n\nRivals of Aether is a brawler (Similar to the likes of Super Smash Bros.) which may only contain (at the moment) 7 characters to try out, but effectively creates a competitive atmosphere in the heat of battle (also, forgot to mention, this game is supposed to be aimed at mainly a competitive audience of brawlers, so don't be a 3 year old damn you).\n\nErm...I'm kinda at a loss of words here (brb getting passionfruit soda). Oh, I know! GAMEPLAY!\n\nEach character has a vast array of moves they can use to defeat the opposition by hitting them so hard, they fly off the stage (also, forgot to mention, this game is heavily inspired off of Super Smash Bros, but no items. Ever.). So sit back, get a bottle of your favourite drink and snacks, and enjoy the rant (brb need moar passionfruit soda).\n\nEach character has different attributes to their moves, so, for example,Absa's moves will not be the same as someone else like Kragg (**** KRAGG). Each character has the ability to double jump, but Absa's double jump is a weird float, kinda like Lucas from Super Smash Bros. Without using a controller (which is highly recommended), the basic controls are Z to attack, X to jump (yeah, wtf), C as special, D as taunt and Up, Down, Left and Right to move (Up doesn't make you jump, it makes your abilities aim upward). Depending on your character, these moves can be chained together into combinations of your moves, or known as "combos" so you don't sound like a stupid. Respectively, each character also has aerial moves as well, which can also chain into their ground moves (see where this is going?). I'm not going over any combos, because I don't know any :P\n\nOverall, RoA is a very well designed game, well worth the $15 price tag on it. Do keep in mind that if you jump online, you will get screwed if you don't know what your doing (like me). RoA gets a 9.2/10.\n\n~Rolleh (WHICH IS ****ING HORRIS)","December 14, 2015","true","9.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I think that when Early Access is over, hopefully everything will be fixed.\n\nWhat I mean by that is it has the POTENTIAL to be an extremely fun game. However, I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME... at least for the moment. I wouldn't feel right about pretending to recommend it.\n\nAbout 1 in every 5 games do I have a connection that I can actually play without disruption. 8/10 games the connecton is so bad it freezes over and over again. Eventually someone will get sick of it and will purposefully suicide due to the terrible connection so that they can move on and hope they can connect to the next person.\n\nCharacters are simply imbalanced. There are a few that are just better than others. Better moves, stronger kill moves, more plentiful ways to combo that "stun" long enough to not allow you to get out of it. It's just the way it is. This NEEDS to be fixed so that two players of equal skill levels don't lose to the other simply due to having a character with stronger attacks and better kill moves.\n\nSo no, don't buy this game. Don't give the developers any more money until they earn it. Character balance fixes, connection fixes, input lag fixes. All of this needs to be fixed before I can recommend Rivals of Aether.\n\nHowever, the few times that the connection is good and the characters in the current game aren't one of the imbalanced ones Rivals of Aether can be very fun. It's those VERY few times that keep me coming back every day.

If you enjoy playing Smash then I would take a good guess that you would most likely enjoy this game.\nAfter putting more time into the game I can still say that this game is extremely fun. I feel that every character is viable and also fun to play which is how the developers created them.\nNot only that but the developers care about the game and are updating it quite often seeing how several patches have been released recently. You can also run into developers in-game on netplay and can identify them by their blue name which goes to show that they put time into their game.\nAlthough recently it feels that this game has died down quite the bit.

First of all, this lacks character choice creativity, because EVERYONE will choose Absa. Second, the character balancing was fine until Absa came along, not that I'm saying Absa should be removed. Finally, it may be just me, but from what Dan Fornace said on Twitter, making a weak character would NOT rise up the percentage. There wouldn't really be a reason to make a character in general.

I really do. It's taking the smash bros. style of platform fighters and taking it somewhere very interesting. It's wonderful\n\nBut I don't live near a lot of people, and I don't invite anyone over to play games at my house. So I have to be completely online\n\nI cannot reccomend this game online because on my very, very stable internet connection, there's input lag and match derops. Now, I don't mean "Oh, two or three frames won't hurt you" kind of input lag. I mean that I have lost entire games, and sometimes sets, because I used my side smash in the wrong direction, because I have to hold the stick up or down so much longer than I would ever have to otherwise. I can't seem to parry at the right time, I'll drop my combos randomely, I've even lost the set beause the one time I finally got Wrastor to down smash it was too late and I had to use my jumps to get back on stage... Except my jump button stopped working.\n\nAnd these are all problems inside of the online system. On the outside, I have lagless matches dropped at complettely random points, and I know they're not dc'ing. I've also been matched up against the same afk person 10 times in a row, whcih gets even worse because the countdown timer stops working for no good reason.\n\nPolish, like menu screen music and an adventure mode, aren't necessary. This game has everything that counts, with 5 great stages, 7 completely unique characters, and a lot of really fun stuff. The polish can come towards the end of early access. But If you can't guarantee certain parts of functionality with the game, you need to share that with your customers.","January 31","false","72.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealnorthgamer/recommended/383980/","therealnorthgamer","NorthGamer17","http://steamcommunity.com/id/therealnorthgamer/","10 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nConsidering this is a game very much like the Super Smash Bros. franchise, this review may be slightly biased. I am a very big fan of fighting games, and the Super Smash Bros. series as a whole. Nevertheless, here is my review.\n\nIt feels like Smash for GBA, which is pretty suiting, considering Dan Fornace's last game based off of Smash was in a Game Boy-esque style. The characters, soundtrack, stages and sprites feel very original, while still having that feel of nostalgia, as well as reminding you that this game is, basically, a Smash game. This is probably the best brawler for PC, and will probably be one of the best fighting games on the Xbox One when it releases later this year. That being said, the game is still in Early Access, meaning it is not finished. Personally, I can't wait until the full game comes out so I can try out the Story and Abyss Modes.\n\nThe game can be played in many different ways. You can play casually or competitively, with friends or without, online or offline, and you can also try one of the two minigame modes, Story Mode and Abyss Mode, once the full game comes out on Steam and Xbox One. It definitely isn't hard to find people, with the online mode to play with friends or random people across the world, and tournaments that will surely be hosted at the level of Smash tournaments, or at least close to it. The game is also relatively cheap, with a price tag of CDN $16.99 (for all of the Americans reading this, or for citizens of other countries, do the math). It also has full controller support, making for more hand room for you and your friends and more fluid gameplay. Rivals of Aether may not have the best graphics, but it makes up for it with fast-paced and easy-to-pick-up fun.\n\nOverall, Rivals of Aether is a great gaming experiene. Whether you are looking to get good at the game, or just looking for a good fighting game on Steam, OR just looking for a good time with your friends and family, Rivals of Aether is the game for you.\n\n- Parker Jamieson a.k.a.

This game is a smash meele inspired game. Some mechanics form meele are here but some of have not. The fighting sytem is similar due to this,however the game is very unique. Each charecter (7 total soon to be 8 at least for now) has their own unique moves an ways to combo them aswell as some type of gimick an not a bad gimick. for example Zetteburn can put fire on the stage and throw fireballs at u which if u touch it or get hit by it u will recieve a burn and for the time it last u take small damage and hiw strong attacks luanch u further. This makes every charecter different and no character is just a clone of another. If u enjoy any of the smashj games u will love this game. due to this being an indie game an the lack of people u know about it those that do play it are very high level players mostly pooring in form smash so u may feel outclassed in the online mode so get gud. i love this game and it deserves more recognition i give it a 9/10. it has some balanceing problem but no charecter is ever rediculousy over powered so the game is still amazing to play.","February 21","true","5.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you're a fan of the Super Smash Bros. series, or simply want something akin to that experience, this is a great game to get into. It's made to play fast, and feels like it's been constructed from the blueprints of Melee's competitive scene. Additionally, a small roster keeps anyone from feeling overwhelmed by a large moveset. Despite this, the variety in the characters and their designs means there's one to fit every playstyle.\n\nI would highly recommend this game for: competitive Smashers, general fans of Smash, those looking for more "platform fighters", or people looking for fast-paced and responsive gameplay.\n\nIf you don't like Smash's construction, or if you want a slower, more tactical approach, this game may not be for you.","November 21, 2015","true","134.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

If you enjoy playing Smash then I would take a good guess that you would most likely enjoy this game.\nAfter putting more time into the game I can still say that this game is extremely fun. I feel that every character is viable and also fun to play which is how the developers created them.\nNot only that but the developers care about the game and are updating it quite often seeing how several patches have been released recently. You can also run into developers in-game on netplay and can identify them by their blue name which goes to show that they put time into their game.\nAlthough recently it feels that this game has died down quite the bit. It also feels like there's not that much to learn and that matches come down to who has the better side of the matchup more often than not.\n\ntl;dr If you enjoy Smash pick up this for the low price and enjoy even though it has some flaws.","September 26, 2015","true","116.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is extremely smoosth and unlike other smash like games, this one does it right.\n\nPros\n\nGreat gameplay and mechanics.\n\nNo sheilding creating more offensive play.\n\nFew characters, but all are unique and fun with none of them being too OP (Krag is not that bad people)\n\nThe stages are interesting and fun to play on with both a tournament/competitive version and a fun casual weird style.\n\nAll characters have something unique about them and are each easy to pick up but hard to master.\n\nThe game includes wavedashing but unlike melee it's not needed to be a good player, just there if you would like to play more competitively.\n\nThe movesets of the characters are things you would never see from a traditional smash game, making it see one of a kind.\n\nGreat servers and online connection, very little lag if any, the only type of lag would be from you having a bad internet, not the servers.\n\nCons\n\nNot as many characters as I would like, though they will be brought in eventually.\n\nEven the level 9 AI is easy to beat, making online the only real place to practice, and if you're downloading something then it might suck.\n\nNo way to see players steam profile after a match if you want to friend them to have a good practice partner.\n\nThese are all minor complaints for what is a fantastic game, from someone who is highly into the competitive smash scene(Going to local tournaments and practicing online constantly) I have to say that I like this game more than smash. It's easier to pick up, and with less character and more room to focus on each match up, much easier to get into competitively.\n","November 16, 2015","true","17.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I look forward to seeing how this develops in the future, and I'll be sure to play this with friends.\n\nYou probably found this if you're a Smash Bros player, in which case you know you're in for some Melee flavored action with a unique spin.\nIf you're not familiar, then you should know that this is a kinda niche title. It still has content that would be good for parties, but if you plan on getting into it more, you'll be seeing a lot of Smash terms.\n\nYou should also know that it doesn't support Gamecube controllers right now, and I don't know if it's planned, but you CAN get it working flawlessly with x360ce.\n\nIdeally I would like to see that support, optimizations in the engine, and little quirks (like Maypul's dair and Orcane's fair not showing hitboxes in training) fixed\n\nI do think this is a stellar release, though. The fighting is fun immediately and the characters have thoughtful design. The training mode settings are great and the attention to detail and certain design choices show that the developer has competitive play in mind. I think this has the potential to really go somewhere if it catches on.\n\nBUT if you're not into Smash, I can't say I recommend it as of the initial release.\nPretty awesome if you do like Smash.","September 22, 2015","true","25.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Fans of competitive Smash will find that this feels pretty much how you think it should. It took me maybe 30 minutes to acclamate to an Xbox One Controller, but after that the game is a blast.\n\n-Things you're probably curious about-\n\nAir-dodging works kind of like Smash-4. You can air dodge only once before touching the ground, but you are able to input commands after the air dodge. this works great for escaping combos and then being able to retaliate mid air. Wave-dashing is also in this game, but with the air dodge mechanics you can't kill yourself by missing a Waveland off the edge, which is a plus.\n\n\nThe hitstun feels a lot like Smash 64, making combos feel extremely clean, but the percent dealt by comboing moves has been adjusted accordingly. L-Cancelling has been done away with, but aerials have very low landing lag, so air -> ground comboing still feels fluid.\n\n\nCharacter selection is currently expectedly low, with only 6 currently playable, but don't let that scare you away. As of writing this, the 3 hours I've put into this game (all in the surprisingly good online play) has been with a single character. Also, since this is still early access, you can be sure to expect new characters in the future.\n\nAll in all, an incredibly good game, it takes the groundwork that the Smash games built, and puts it into a competitively-aimed game with remarkable results. 10/10","September 22, 2015","true","29.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Not just Melee. Here is why:\n\nThe combos are satisfying and not too difficult to pull off.\n\nThe developers got "Omega Stages" right.\n\nThey do take a bit of getting used to if you have played Smash, but the controls aren't too complicated.\n\nParrying is easy and dosen't require much practice unlike in Street Fighter 3.\n\nI hardly came across any lag online.\n\nThe music puts a smile on my face, and I can't usually say that to describe music in a fighting game.\n\nThe  characters are balanced.\n\nI do have one major problem about most of the players I find online, however. A really small amount of people I fight online actually want to play the game, and a large ammount just seem to want to kill themselves. I have come across so many people online that just kill themselves as soon as the match starts, so I hope the develpers can find a way around that problem.\n\nOverall, Rivals Of Aether is a fun, satifying and smashing (I'm sorry) game that is barely flawed.","September 22, 2015","true","11.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Plugged in an xinput controller, figured out how to change the controls on the controller to fit my SSB4 settings and this was the result:\n-Fresh 2D gameplay\n-UNIQUE character gameplay (hardly any skill overlaps, loads of fun mechanics and counterplay)\n-Not too much imbalance. Fire does a bit more than I'd like as it basically makes a huge danger area for no reason at all.\n-Easy to learn (after about an hour or two) but near impossible to master.\n\nNegatives? Sometimes you are matched with the same 3 people with like 550 ping. Annoying. Also no chat, double edged sword right there. Less toxic, also less banter between people who want to compliment each other.\n\nThis is a game in ALPHA 0.0.2 or something.

For an early access build, The game feels complete competitively, with netplay accessibilities that run decently. I could foresee lots of lag in areas with low ping, but thankfully I do not have that issue. The price is only going to get higher the longer you wait, and the players are only going to get better the longer you wait, so I would advise you buy it as soon as you want, but preferrably during the earliest part of the early access release.

IS. AWESOME! Best $15 I've spent in a LONG time! Unlike what people have been saying, it's really not just a Smash clone. It's so similar, yet so different. Similar in a good way, so it feels natural to Smash players. Different in a few MAJOR factors: No blocking, no grabbing, no ledges, and every character is unique in some way.\nWant an ACTUALLY stealthy character? Forsburn is perfect. A character that can teleport between "portals" they lay down? You won't find anyone like Orcane in Smash. Or how about someone who can make ENTIRE WALLS right below him, instantly? That would be Kragg.\n\nSo basically, this game is different enough from Smash to be fun for Smash players, yet similar enough so it's easy to learn. I HIGHLY recommend this game to anyone who likes Smash, or anyone looking for a good, easy to run fighting game that's good for partys.\n\nComplaints: Spam is a little hard to deal with in this game, especially Zetterburn fireball spam. That's really it. I do wish they added support for the Gamecube to USB adapters, as Gamecube controllers just feel much more precise than Xbox 360 controllers, but that's just a minor complaint.","September 26, 2015","true","24.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For example, the character Wrastor can perform strong attacks (smash attacks) in the air while the character zetterburn can set you on fire in order to activate his sweet spots for his attacks. Recovering to the stage is also very different from smash bros as ledgegrabbing is not in this game. This causes you to be very creative with your recovery and rely on walljumps to get back to the stage. Other differences include parrying instead of shielding and a lack of grabbing.\nEven if you have put in countless hours into Smash Bros, you will find a fresh and enjoyable experience with Rivals of Aether. The game is smooth, fact, and filled with satisfying combos. Rivals of Aether feels less like a smash bros clone and more like an entry to the platform fighter genre. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys smash bros or fighting games.\n","October 4, 2015","true","14.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Would recommend to all Smash Brothers fans and fighting game aficionados across the Steam platform. Take a break from Street Fighter and Tekken and play a game where you can make your own combos with such a small amount of moves; plus, it's a break from the ultra-realistic 3D gore and special effects. ^^;\n\nMy second time trying out a game such as this (after prior experience with Smash Brothers' replicas such as Super Smash Flash 2), I was exepcting something less impressive or similar to all the others. The controls are easy to adjust to and pick up, especially if you're using an XBOX PC controller, then it plays like a dream. The pixel-art is amazing, kudos to all those involved in this game, amazing animation and stage design. The characters, I thought there would be at least one or two characters I wouldn't want to play with, but after around a few hours of gameplay, I'm comfortable with them all. The moveset for each character is rather unique; no repetition whatsoever. Hopefully, other online modes will be available in the future, but hey, baby steps. This is only early access and I'm already impressed. I procastinated over my homework to play a couple more hours of this game. I can see that there are some suggested features but not available for choice. Such as 'Online' in the options menu and the other spaces in the character roster.

Melee AKA Best Smash game. The available cast is small but unique with each characters having their particular mechanics and styles of play. It incorporates some of the adanved techniques found in Melee like Dash Dancing and Wavedashing (Which is made incredibly easier to perform). L-cancel isn't present as the landing lag is very low in general. The combo game is top notch making his game one that you would spend hours practicing and performing combos. Story mode and Abyss mode are not available yet and 2 characters have yet to be announced officially.\n\nVerdict: As it stands, Rivals of Aether is a stellar and fun addition to the growing Platform Fighter genre. It is a satisfying game with the components that made Super Smash Bros. Melee such a fun game with great retention value that made the game played all the way up to this day.

The way the lag is set up, you can manage to, for example, get off two hard-hitting aerials, plus get a fast start from the nonexistant landing lag. It's crazy how different I find myself playing in RoA than Melee, which I wasn't expecting. This game was blowing up in the SSBM community so I decided to try it out, definitely a great game for a Melee fan.

I was a little hesistant at first, buying only because I had never really gotten too much into Super Smash Bro.s type games before.

Along with it being fun it is very unbalanced. The characters are very fun and diverse but only a few have problems. Orcane can spam attacks and along with that his attacks do a whole bunch of damage. Kragg before the new update could do this as well. Forsburn isnt all that good of a character his attacks are slow and hard to pull off. Wrastor is a very good character because although his combo set might be a lot better than most of any of the other characters, its actually hard to pull off and feels rewarding unlike orcane where you can just spam it the whole time. Maypul is the same as Wrastor in terms of being a lot more fair. Zetterburn is very mixed. His attacks do a lot of damage but along with that his attacks are extremely easy to block. Orcane can block almost anything, rarely dies because of the ink/water that he can use to send him on the stage again. Speaking of stages they all feel to small for what the game is trying to pull off. Overall the game is very good, along with its minor flaws A.K.A spammable attacks, hard to play characters and small maps.

Would recommend to all Smash Brothers fans and fighting game aficionados across the Steam platform. Take a break from Street Fighter and Tekken and play a game where you can make your own combos with such a small amount of moves; plus, it's a break from the ultra-realistic 3D gore and special effects. ^^;\n\nMy second time trying out a game such as this (after prior experience with Smash Brothers' replicas such as Super Smash Flash 2), I was exepcting something less impressive or similar to all the others. The controls are easy to adjust to and pick up, especially if you're using an XBOX PC controller, then it plays like a dream. The pixel-art is amazing, kudos to all those involved in this game, amazing animation and stage design. The characters, I thought there would be at least one or two characters I wouldn't want to play with, but after around a few hours of gameplay, I'm comfortable with them all. The moveset for each character is rather unique; no repetition whatsoever. Hopefully, other online modes will be available in the future, but hey, baby steps. This is only early access and I'm already impressed. I procastinated over my homework to play a couple more hours of this game. I can see that there are some suggested features but not available for choice. Such as 'Online' in the options menu and the other spaces in the character roster. I'm most looking forward to Story Mode and Aether Mode; curious as to how this will be executed.\n\n:)\n\nStill hard to believe this was made in Gamemaker:Studio.","September 27, 2015","true","14.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This indicates to me that the game is pretty well balanced. While a cast of 6 may seem slightly underwhelming, there are no clones and each Rival has a very unique playstyle with special setups. This means that the player is likely to play all of the characters with equal interest, as opposed to solely maining one in any another fighting game.\nThe soundtrack is very reminiscient of the SNES days, and the pixel art and animations are cute and pleasing.\nRivals already has me hooked, and it's only in alpha.

Most of the mechanics are the same except you can't grab on ledges but instead jump off walls and use your up special again, and the shield is replaced with parries which can stun the oppent for a short time. This adds a lot of variety to the game such as edgegaurding and comboing ( yes, combos longer than 2 or 3 hits) which makes the game a refreshing vamp to smashbros. The characters are all developed in depth with different abilitites making the small pool of characters available understandable. The gameplay is adtoundingly fun and I find myself doing quick matches in between homework or chores or whatnot. As of now it looks like the game has potential to go competitive, so keep you're eye on this game ;).

I love absolutely everything about it. I have the most fun going up against my friends who are around the same skill level as I am.\n\nHowever, there is two things I'd like to bring up, which would be the online matchmaking. First thing's first: every single time I'd come on to play against people online, a combination of these things would happen: the game was extremely laggy (Smash Bros. Brawl laggy), the opponent I was going against was INSANELY good, destroying me within seconds of the match starting, or matches wouldn't start at all due to some sort of glitch that has players stuck in the character select screen.\n\nI think a skill level system should be implemented, since fighting against those really good players has completely turned me off from the game's online; it made the game un-fun and absolutely infuriating when every match I'd have a Zetterburn or Forsburn that completely dominated me.\n\nI'd also noticed that sometimes my control schemes weren't saved, so when I enter an online match, it'a really awkward to see that I had no clue what the jump button and attack button were (sometimes even the move buttons). I use an Xbox controller, by the way. Not sure if it's the controller or the game that doesn't save my control schemes but I would like to see it updated so that they're saved; it would be a great help.\n\nDespite being an Early Access game, Rivals of Aether has blown me away with how fulfilling it is. I would recommend anybody who likes games similiar to Smash Bros. to buy this game NOW. Even if you don't like fighting games, BUY THIS FRIGGIN' GAME! I'm not even sure what genre Smash Bros. is, since it really isn't a TRUE fighting game, but it's not a pure brawler either. It's one of those rare little games you can't find very often. Rivals of Aether and Smash Bros. are definitely that type of game.","October 9, 2015","true","21.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is something special. Do yourself a favor, and don't bother reading this review. Just play the game, Schneebly!\nBut for those of you who don't trust vague suggestions from random strangers on the internet:\n\nI have never been huge on fighting games. I loved Smash, but in moderation. I have also dabbled in Marvel vs Capcom, MUGEN, Skull Girls, and some others. This game single-handedly piqued my interest in the competetive fighting game scene. I followed this game for at least a year, tracking its development. Within the first day of playing Early Access, I was hooked on studying the strategy, getting to know the characters, and learning the ins-and-outs of how to beat the tar out of my friends.\n\nThe game is amazingly deep and strategically complex for a 2D brawler, and I am hooked. I spent the better part of yesterday playing with my friend, just battling 1v1 over and over and over. We barely changed characters in between.\n\nGraphics: Awesome pixel art. Super reminiscent of my favorite SNES games, but somehow prettier. 9/10\n\nAnimation: Gorgeous. Smooth. Hits are satisfying, motion is believable, characters have weight, playing looks and feels perfect. 10/10\n\nControls: Simple, but lots of possibilities therein. Control mapping is totally customizable. Characters are responsive, feels great. 10/10\n\nGameplay: Addicting. So, so addicting. Will be a perfect 10 after the release of more gamemodes, but in EA, it easily gets a 9/10\n\nFeatures: So much strategy. Characters are incredibly unique and have the COOLEST movesets I've ever seen in a fighting game. As a zoning character, Orcane alone blew my mind, Kragg is my personal favorite, but each character has such a uniqe, creative, impressive, amazingly tactical moveset that greatly caters to their individual strengths and weaknesses. Zetterburn feels a bit overpowered at times, but overall the characters are very well evenly matched in the hands of capable players.  10/10\n\nBUY IT!! Support the developers of this amazing indie game. I cannot stress enough, if you have ANY interest in fighting games, you will LOVE Rivals of Aether.

This game is fun if you are playing for ♥♥♥♥♥ and giggles, but can sometimes be frustrating so bring a salt shield.\n\nThere are a couple of characters I believe need tweaking and balancing like Zetterburn and Forsburn and maybe Kragg, but other than that the characters are all balanced, but they each require huge skill to be decent with. I recommend using Zetterburn for transitioning players from smash to get used to how the game works and moves. FYI, you can wavedash for those who know what that is.\n\nThere are 6 characters at the time of this review, and those characters are  Zetterburn	 and  Forsburn	 (the Fire characters),  Kragg	 and  Maypul	 (the Earth characters),  Wrastor	 (the only Wind character right now), and finally  Orcane	 (the only Water character right now).\n\nThe game if fun and highly competitive.
