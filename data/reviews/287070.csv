Battle Academy is a turn-based tactical WWII strategy game where you can command various infantry, tank, transports, etc across a tile based battlefield. The UI and clear presentation make it approachable for players without a lot of war game experience. Even though war is a serious subject, the story in the campaign is presented in a pretty light-hearted comic book / graphic novel style.The game has three campaigns covering North Africa, D-Day and the Ardennes.\n\nI enjoyed my time with Battle Academy. Movement, line of sight, and morale, along with detailed combat factors make for interesting battles. When I initially played the game the UI shrouded many of the details factored into combat, but the easy-to-mod data files and scripts do offer up all of the juicy bits. I actually modded the game so the UI exposed more of the factors (and I'm not a big modder, although I do have  a software development background). This lack of information was the biggest drawback for me, but more data may now be exposed by the UI without modding because according to the patch notes some more advanced tool tips were added. The scenarios provide enough of a challenge for victory with the option to try for more difficult achievements, accommodating a variety of skill levels. Ambushes and bombardments keep the tension up as you fear for the virtual soldiers traversing the open ground. Expansions, user-created content, and multi-player options should extend the game's shelf life.

Dismouted Scouts, wheeled & tracked Recce Vehs / APCs (Sdkfz 234/1 armored car, Sdkfz 251/16 half-track and more) are used  to peel back the fog of war, and find soft targets that cannot otherwise be seen until they fire.   Light, Medium and Heavy Armour options exist, (M5s, Shermans, Fireflys, PNzr II. III, Panthers, Tigers, Jagdpanthers, Marder, Hummel, British Matilda 1&2, French FT-17 Lt Tk, R35 Med Tk, Char Bis & Somua 35 Heavy Tk, Italian  Autoblinda 41 armoured car, Carro Armato L640, Fiat 3000 and more) to soften up Infantry or take out opposition vehicles.  Then infantry of several of several types (Scouts / Engineers / Waffen SS / Paratroops / FJ / Commandos / Rangers / Flamethrowers etc) against a wide variety of AT / MG guns and other Inf.  - There are many, many more unit types - however - the widest variety of units may only be accessed by buying several of the DLCs.\n\nSome scenarios have onboard indirect fire i.e. Mortars and Assault Guns, some scenarios have offboard Artillary / Naval Guns / or Airstrikes (Stukas, Hurricanes, P47s), there is as well some AA & SPAA.  Most every scenario and campaign in the main game and DLC is from the Allied side where one can play as US/ UK/ and Canadian units - there are as well a few Axis scenarios and a short campaign where one can fight as the Germans against mostly the French and UK.\nThe commercial scenarios are pretty fun and fairly plentiful -  however the DLC price hit for each new campaign is a bit of a downer.  I liked the scenarios / campaigns but there is too much nickle and diming for my tastes, (the mod scene is however very active with a large # of homebrew single and multi-player scenarios).\n\nA fairly gentle learning curve starts things off easy for noobs and maybe too easy for vets, but things soon ramp up and one has to use pretty realistic tactics to crack differant tactical problems.  Commanders will soon be wondering where to spend or save their scenario options like medic points (reviving injured soliders), leader points (to rally squads with low / broken morale); as well most campaigns let you earn and spend scenario points to buy new units and upgrade your combat team's resources.\nPeople raised on fully-3D games may not like the graphics, but for what it is and what it should be compared to I liked it's simple and effective style, the terrain and units are easy to discern, I do however wish the camera controls were a little better.\nIn the end not quite detailed tactially as the newer Close Combat games, nor quite as addictive as the old PG series, but still a good game with plentiful scenarios, will keep most grognards entertained and still fun for new players.\n\n- Fun:  8/10\n- Historical Interest: 7.5/10\n- Ease of learning, continual challenge: 7.5/10\n- Replay Value: 6/10 (if you don't mind using the editor to make mods then 8/10)\n- Presentation / GUI: 7.5/10 (I like the comic book intros & transitions...)\n- Value for your $: 7.5/10 (good game but don't nickle us with each DLC being so short.)\n\n== Overall: 80%","January 24","true","19.4"," 22 of 23 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","22","23","0","0"

No longer do I have my cardboard chints to push around, but a more visually enjoyable set of troop counters. This game is perfect for those unfamiliar with the war-gaming experience and has plenty of battles to work through. Even experienced grognards will find this game rewarding.  The game was developed with the help of Historians to make sure the tactics, scenarios and the firepower represent that which was fought in WW2 battles. Battles are influenced to some extent by your performance.  It has a following of players who have also developed custom scenarios to play solo and multiplayer.  The game is completely scripted which allows you to create your own missions and scenarios in a rather simple and effective way.\nI recommend it as a fun and entertaining war-game.\n","April 19, 2014","true","2.9"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","3"

It makes sense that the game was built this way considering that it was originally commissioned by the BBC (yes, that BBC). That explains the graphics and the square grid maps. I know it looks like a Litchtenstein painting. Get over that. It's quite a good game.\n\nThis is simple, get-to-it wargaming. Are some of the scenarios easy? Yes, but others (especially the customs mods) can be a nice challenge. Also, don't forget the multi-player options.\n\nRemember, it's wargaming.

The strategies are important if you wish to do well and keep your units alive, yet, not too large of a learning curve. Graphics are somewhat  "comic book" in nature, not in a derogatory way at all, quite like them.\n\nPerfect for getting into a scenario quickly, finishing or playing as long as you like, saving, and coming back later.\n\nIf you are looking for very in depth logistics or cutting edge graphics, this isn't the product for you. For relatively low learning curve, fun graphical content, great sound effects, many types of units and terrain, you can't beat the BA franchise.\n\nWould love to see Slitherine produce a campaign version of this product.

After playing for a while, I conclude it's not ready for prime time.  I played the board game and was looking forward to this computer version.  I found the first few games interesting but quickly realized the AI's limitations.  The multiplayer is really WAY TOO SLOW.  There should be some sort of match-play where you can start and finish a game in real-time.  This would make more sense since each move takes like 15 seconds.  There should also be a fog of war option to make it more realistic and to encourage scouting.  There's also issues of the game freezing and locking up, especially with the Bitter End campaign.  I also found the Battle of the Bulge campaign confusing as to what victory points I had or what victory conditions were about to be triggered.\n\nHopefully the game can be improved and re-released.","October 17, 2015","false","282.4"," 23 of 39 people (59%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","59","23","39","3","3"

The gui is ancient. However the game play is great, and although Battle Academy is easy to learn and enjoy, it has enough challenge to cater for more hard core wargamers. Note, the game is not about realism, however the tactical gameplay is fun.\n\nUnfortunately BA doesn't come with a skirmish mode, but the core game and dlc offer plenty of play time.\n\nBattle Academy 2 is even better, with its fine tuning, Eastern Front armored clashes and a skirmish mode which ensures replayability.\n\nNevertheless I can highly recommend the original Battle Academy, but be sure to get the full collection as it saves you a lot of money.","May 31, 2015","true","4.9"," 16 of 26 people (62%) found this review helpful","62","16","26","0","0"

Set in a simplified version of WW2, you move units on a square grid. Youa re primarily taking the British side against the Axis powers, Italians and Germans, and the initial campaign is in Africa, where you take the Desert Rats and the Matilda tanks against the Italians and later, Rommel's Afrika Corps.\n\nThe battlefield is 3D, albeit with very clunky camera controls, and it's likely that this was a mobile game backport (as it's also available in the App Store for iOS)  The idea is your unit have 2 movement points and 2 shooting points, spend them wisely. Flanking the enemy is good, as hitting the enemy at their strong armor will cause a "deflection". But the general idea is simple: medium tanks against light tanks, light tanks against infantry to suppress, suppress hidden infantry then attack with your own infantry.\n\nThere are 3 levels of difficulty, and ability to allocate your own force mix before battle, as well as fog of war.\n\nThe overall mechanics are very simple, and thus, is only suitable for noobs who needs handholding to the genre of wargames. Veterans will likely be turned off by the simplified and somewhat cartoony feel, constant onscreen reminders of certain game mechanics (which may be due to me playing in easy mode) and overall in-game playments.\n\n","July 3, 2015","false","0.9"," 28 of 49 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","28","49","0","0"

There is a huge variety of missions especially if you get the complete pack. There is enough complexity to also keep more experienced wargamers interested. I was really surprised at how good this game is. My only negative would be the rather steep price especially for the complete game, given the fact that for all intents and purposes it is a souped up Ipad port.

There's plenty of units to go around and I like the environments too, (Of the first 3 campaigns, the game and the DLC are overpriced. I got them on the Humble Bundle) before every mission you get some base units, you have extra points which you can use to get additional units, like more of a specific type of tank or infantryman, like the AT infantry who are good at taking care of tanks, the regular infantrymen who take care of enemy infantry for you, I don't think the germans are playable with the base game (Other than in skirmish?) but with DLC they might be. If you're gonna buy any DLC you might as well but it all for 20 euro rather than buy them all singularily for 70 or so. That's a straight rip-off. The base game offers some challenging missions, and offers the battle of Normandy, Africa and the Ardennes. All from the side of the Allies.\n\nOverall it's a good turn-based game which is sadly overpriced.

Graphics are good and it's well styalized, but not the greatest choice for RTS veterans.","April 21, 2014","true","7.9"," 8 of 20 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","8","20","0","2"

No matter.  Surprisingly deep turn based war strategy.  TONS of scenarios.  The base game has a bunch, and there are dlc scenarios.  My favorite part about this game is how quickly it moves.  No long winded animations that take forever.  All troops move and act quickly.  I have only played a handful of scenarios so far, but they were good.  well thought out and historically accurate.  Customizable troop loadout with pre battle hiring.  If you are a srategy lover, especially turn based tactical games, this is worth a look.  If slitherine puts it on sale with all the dlc go for that!  Hurry, they dont't always do sales.","November 28, 2014","true","10.5"," 4 of 12 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","4","12","0","0"

What could I said about this wonderfull game? I first played it in 2012 and I was amazed by the game in general. Multiple detailled unit, no life point (like in real life), a great turn-basede game. The problem was that I didn't buyed it (it was illegal and i'm not proud of it). Now, when I heard that the game was going on steam, I was obliged to buy it.\n\nThis is a must-buy.

In other words it's easy to learn how to play the game since it only requires the use of the mouse but there are loads of variables in game that make it hard to effective right off the bat (which occurs at realistic difficult, it is definately the difficulty setting you want to stick to)\n\n- Replayability in the form of Normandy skirmishes + allied special assaignments + axis special assaignments + if you want to restart every campaign from the beginning upon having completed it.\n\n-Sound effects are pretty good in general, love the sound of machine gun fire, rifles shooting, infanrty yelling in their native tounges telling you weather they are suppressed or retreating. They could of done a better job on tank guns however.\n\n-Satisfaction is garenteed when you manage to claw victory from the jaws of defeat, or when you destroy superior german armor with weaker allied armor\n\n-Tanks have realistic armor values, strongest armor up front, weak on sides, weakest at the rear. You can pivot units on a tile so that they face the enemy with their stongest armor.\n\n-Different "power ups' per level ranging from carpet bombing, to strafing runs, arty strikes, to Medic (being able to heal one dead troop in an infantry squad), to resupply (resupplying AT charges on infantry units that have used them up) etc.\n\n-Different maps with different terrain layout in each level\n\n-LOS mechanic which is fair, if infantry, Fixed AT are in buildings or bushes they are invisible until they fire repeatedly or are spotted by other infantry. Scouts have longer LOS than other units but aren't that great in combat.\n\n-Game braking bugs are non-existant (or rare idk if any one else has run into major problems but my version has run smoothly since I installed it)\n\n-scenarios are not too long nor are they too short, about 20-25 mins per scenarios (there is also a save feature if you want to save the current mission you are playing)\n\nCons(some may be pros for certain ppl):\n\n-Graphics are hit n miss for some. Meaning some won't mind how it looks while others will find it a bit trash. They're not next gen but they're not that bad.\n\n-Power ups mentioned before like Arty strike, strafing runs , bombing runs do not show which tiles they effect. You need to guess where it's gonna hit and place the markers infront of advancing enemies so that they run into the effected area. Some may take serveral turns before they land which is something to consider.\n\n-Certain sound assets arent great i.e. tanks fireing, tanks engines, truck engines etc.\n\n-Ground forces focus only, you'll never get to fully control Air units or Naval units (you only get to call in air or naval support, you can't control fighter squadrons or ships)\n\n-No base building, you only get the units you choose at the start + reinforcements after several turns(in certain scenarios)\n\n-In game UI isn't great could definately use more work.\n\n-A bit too easy on lower difficulty, and even realistic is a medium challenge at times it does get a lot harder in campaigns like Sea Lion and Market Garden.\n\n-The Game is very pricey to get all these expansion campaigns I suggest you wait for a sale since it's with all the campaigns that the game truely shines (it's lack luster in content in vanilla I found)\n\nConclusion: If you enjoy wargames this is deffinately a no brainer,  if you're new to war games Battle Academy is just as accomedating. So pick it up on sale and you won't regret your purchase!","June 10, 2015","true","100.0"," 2 of 8 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","2","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesunsets/recommended/287070/","thesunsets","General Hoth","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thesunsets/","28 products in account","For those considering purchasing this game:\n\n\n1) Type\n\nBattle Academy is not an RTS and it is not a traditional (that means turn based) strategy game either.  It is a mix.  If you find that there are themes in both types that appeal to you, then this game may be quite pleasing.  However, because it is a mixed breed, the game most likely will  not satisfy hard core gamers of either type.\n\n2) Type: historical accuracy\n\nThis game is a game based on historical events, the second World War.  While nowhere as near as historicaly accurate as a game like Panzer Corps, this game is much better then what you see in most history-based strategy games, especially the ones from this time period.   For example, don't expect to see game play including the Soviet Union nuking Nato powers, Russian soldiers executing Western Allied soldiers (like downed pilots), ect.\n\n3) Viability\n\nThis game has so much content!!! The series also has two games, not one and the first game has more content then most series do.\n\n4) Fun\n\nThis game merges really fun, creative and innovative mechanics while keeping the game historically accurate and realistic.\n\n\nI highly recommend this game to all WWII history fans/gamers, and recommend it to the rest of the gaming community.  This is not the best WWII strategy game out there, not even close, but it's well worth the price tag and will appeal to larger portions of the gaming community.","March 13","true","51.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Long time I didn't play such balanced and nicely created game. I am old wargamer and I recommend this to all wargamers. It reminds me old days with Steel Panters II and also Panzer General a bit. There is only one thing I am not sure of. Angle of view for units. Sometimes it happens that I engage tanks from back or side and they are still able to see me and shoot at me. Tanks have poor visibility against infantry and this factor was not really taken into account. However fantastic game....9/10.
