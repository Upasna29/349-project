I’d seen plenty of unpredictable, often hilarious things happen as a result of my violent actions -- I once shot a driver who then rolled his truck into a zebra, over a bridge, and into a river. Moments like this get more out of hand in Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4.\n\nBut when remembering my truly definitive Far Cry moments, and when asking myself which Far Cry game is best, I always think about Marty Alencar, the friend I murdered.\n\nMarty was my first and best Buddy in Far Cry 2’s Africa. He was the man I rescued from a fiery plane crash. The guy who always brought me back to life when I took too many bullets, put a gun in my hand, and stood by my side until everyone around me died.\n\nFar Cry 4’s Guns for Hire system operates on a similar idea to Far Cry 2’s Buddy System, allowing you to summon an ally instantly to fight alongside you. But they’re nameless henchmen, expendable fodder I used to deliberately detonate landmines and send to certain death for the sake of distraction. I never cared about any of them. I used them.\n\nCompare this to Far Cry 2, where I relied on Marty, approaching him every time I stepped out the door, knowing he’d tell me he had my back, knowing it was true. Marty was a good man, always ready with another option when a mission wasn’t going to benefit me as much as it could. Yes, these “character traits” fed into the gameplay structure and story missions of Far Cry 2, but it convinced me that Marty Alencar was more than a Buddy -- he was a friend.\n\nMarty dragged me out of the line of fire and into the bushes when a random group of guys jumped me on the road. Stupid. You never take the road. A gunner on the back of a truck mowed me down while I fell into my own misplaced Molotov flames. Marty hands me a pistol and opens fire. I find a couple grenades, knock the truck around, and finish the job. When it’s all done, I hear Marty screaming for help. I can’t see him.\n\nBy the time I find his blue smoke streaming out of the woods, he’s grunting incoherently. I kneel down, jab a regenerative needle into his stomach, and wait for him to head home. He doesn’t get up. He’s still wounded, so I put another needle in him. Nothing, but he slows down, and his eyes roll upward. One more needle. Marty’s head hits the ground, and he stops squirming.\n\nI overdosed my best friend.\n\nThe wieght and impact moments like this have is why Far cry 2 is the real gem of the series and how Far Cry was meant to be. The pure unscripted brilliance.\n","October 16, 2015","true","22.6"," 418 of 441 people (95%) found this review helpful 112 people found this review funny","95","418","441","112","13"

I found so many slight adjustments that occurred whilst I was playing, such as you came in the game in the dry season, as evidenced by the fires visible on the cab ride into town, plus the cab driver's admission that it WAS the dry season.  That meant that the flare gun and Molotov cocktails were at their peak efficiency for destruction, since when the wet season came about three hundred hours later, the grass turned green and your flame and smoke damage were quite a bit reduced.\n\nAlso if you timed the moon just right, you could pick a cloudy night for a most stealthy job and have a better chance of completetion.\n\nI found out at 750 hours that after you ride shotgun on that weapons barge across the lake, and you warn the doctor, that you don't have to fight you way thru the town to make it out alive.  You could just hop up on the cart, climb the stall to the tarp above it, jump onto the roof of the clay building just behind the Dr.'s office and make your way to the swamp boats that were moored right there in the garbage cove.\n\nI would pile cars up  in special preset locations and set C4 to explode as I approached the exits, and then had a Liberty Jeep waiting (those are the best armor rating, except for the 3 tonners, I have read others more informed than I say) to ride like a snowplow thru the enemy blasting away. Thank goodness for game saves, those made it possible for me to complete the game in many situations where I, in my mighty inflated ego, thought the only  way through was blasting away and running and dodging like a basketball player making way downcourt.\n\nI do believe that playing the game on Master (Very Hard) is the only way to play, and you should be by the first five hours, unless you are a nubie, it gives the enemy some brains, and they go after you, not just wait to be shot.  Love the way they will ambush and surprize you, call you out.\n\nThat you can go back into the first area in FC2 after getting cooler weapons in the second area is a great idea.  Going back and blasting like no tomorrow is a nice way to past time.   Using subtrafuge, and disattraction, with drawing their attention to the other side of the camp and knifing the few left on duty station is a way of penetrating into some camps that you feel just have to be obliterated by grenade-launcher technicals until you realize there is another way, and another, and another ad nauseum.\n\nThere are just so many ways to accomplish each mission, with the one where if you kill everyone in the mine, except the bosses in the tin admin shack, they will ply you to let them live and you can  walk right into an office of the enemy with all of your weapons and just blast them to bits, which until then you thought that you needed to be searched and disarmed before entering the mucky-mucks hdqtrs.  The thumbs-up the dude at the door gives you when you arrive to fulfill the promise they gave at the mine is awesome, dude is like, no problem, bro.\n\nIf you drive a nade-jeep all the way up the narrow path to the safe house to contact your mercanary friend about the killing of the government minister of censory before having the dejay read the propaganda to kill the medical doctor in his rounds, you can step outside of the safe house right after the meeting and climb directly into the jeep without touching the ground, and blast away over the hillside into the resort area where he is residing with his finger on the cut-off switch in case anyone trys what you are gonna do.  I thought it was easy having a nade-boat fifty feet away in a cove ready to go a hundred feet to blast the resort, but being able to hop outside and complete her or his part of the mission within seconds is majical.\n\nThis is perhaps not so much a game as a sort of lifestyle alteration.\n\n","November 25, 2013","true","334.2"," 491 of 528 people (93%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","93","491","528","0","15"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/derpobugginz/recommended/19900/","derpobugginz","Zibarro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/derpobugginz/","263 products in account","I'm going to begin this review with a confession: Far Cry 2 is my favorite game in the Far Cry series.\n\nSince that one was so well received, let me go for a second confession: Far Cry 2 is probably the least popular game in the Far Cry series.\n\nIt is my favorite game in the series because of the overall "attitude" of the game. It is everything Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is not. It is the very antithesis of Blood Dragon: Where Blood Dragon revels in being irreverent, ridiculous, and detached from reality, Far Cry 2 is gritty, realistic, and dark. It is a modern retelling of The Heart of Darkness, in which you play a mercenary hunting an arms dealer in a fictional African country, all the while battling malaria.\n\nIt is not the most open world. You are not a bullet sponge. Health does not regenerate, and in fact guns will jam on you based on how dirty they are. There isn't even a skill tree or a quick melee button (you have to manually switch to your machete). However, it is probably the single most immersive gave I've played in a long time if not ever, and a fantastic story takes you through a unique setting not often seen (or done well) in games.\n\nGameplay: Far Cry 2 is dated. It's not unplayable, but if you've recently played some of the other Far Cry games then the absence of some features is certainly conspicuous. However, the guns have punch, the player is fragile, fire is dangerous (it's a dry African setting), and the game reeks of realism. Yes, reeks. The main reasons people hated this game were because your character has malaria and because guns jam. Guns jamming is avoidable but you do have to address the malaria from time to time. It plays like a survival game, because you have to struggle to win (without it being too punishing). There's no skill tree and you have to really work for your equipment upgrades. While this isn't for everyone, if you go in expecting this kind of gameplay, you're going to enjoy the game more than someone going in blind. 8/10\n\nGraphics/Visual Experience: While the game is old, the graphics aren't too bad. I go back and play this every once in a while and I'm blown away by some of the nature scenes. The game is truly impressive when compared to other games released at the time and that gives it some true staying power. The environment is immersive (the first game I ever actually got lost in: The first day I played it, I played it for 12 hours straight) and while it's not in the same way characters in Skyrim have complete lives, it's still capable of sucking you in if you let it. The score that follows accounts for both the game being dated but still capable of impressing me: 7.75/10\n\nSound: The song from the title screen is still on my phone somewhere. Guns don't always have a bassy sound but always feel like they have some punch. Ambient/background noise is done well, gives the environment some life without having wild animals like 3 and 4 do. 7.5/10\n\nReplayability: Not as much as the later games in the series. The main draw of 2 is the immersion and story. While the environment can suck you in, it's not particularly fun to explore because you don't get the feeling of missing out on interesting things as you drive from place to place. If you're like me you'll want to play and play until you finish the story, but there is a hard ending and that also kills post-story replayability. 5.5/10\n\nHow it Runs: It's still a demanding game. I've played games released in late 2015 that made my computer run hot less often than this game. However, there are very rarely spikes in the resources the game needs to play smoothly. Physics aren't too intense, the worst the lag will probably get is when there's a bunch of fire on the screen. This is the first game with fire propagation, which they certainly wanted to show off. They actually had to set a limit because during testing, there were times when the entire in-game world was set on fire without the limit in place.","December 25, 2013","true","48.0"," 307 of 346 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","307","346","2","3"

Unlimited gunplay. Setting fires that spread with the wind. Hunting down your target with a machete. Firing a mortar into a pack of zebras.\n\nThere's a reason this game still garners respect and admiration, and retains a cult-following to this day. It's an, "off the beaten path," strategy-laced masterpiece. The gunplay is raw and satisfying. The environments are beautiful. The map is massive.\n\nThe main complaint thrown at this game is respawning guard posts. The reason so many people hated this mechanic is because they played Far Cry 2 like a Call of Duty title. This game is not about just pressing the X button occasionally in between set-piece action sequences. This game forces you to slow your roll, take out your map, and plan a route to your target. It simply wants you to take your time with it. This is part of the beauty of the game.\n\nEach and every situation in Far Cry 2 has unlimited potential. Almost everything happens dynamically. You may have heard the term, "emergent gameplay," being tossed around in the gaming press as of late. Well, Far Cry 2 was ahead of it's time for attempting to show the mainstream what "emergent gameplay" actually is, and in my opinion, the mainstream wasn't quite ready for it when this game released back in 2008.\n\nIf you end up playing Far Cry 2, make sure you play it on either "Hardcore" or "Infamous" difficulty. It turns the A.I. into what you'd think gangs of vicious mercenaries and cold-blooded killers should be.\n\nJust effin' buy it.","February 16, 2014","true","8.7"," 162 of 178 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","162","178","0","0"

You could start anywhere really, the setting is in Africa, you enter the country (I forget if they say. [yes I know Africa is a continent]) hunting a man known as ''The Jackal'' an arms dealer and your mission is to eliminate him; to stop the gun trafficking in the war torn country, but things turn down south immediatly after your boots touch the ground you've gotten malaria (This... This was one of the annoying/funny things I found that happen in the game, I mean c'mon it's freaking Malaria no one really wants to black out in the middle of a gun fight, I mean when I did I kept screaming ''♥♥♥♥! ♥♥♥♥! ♥♥♥♥! Not now! Surely I have one more pill to keep me going!'' But alas I didn't and woke up a day later in a church now angry about the travel time I have to ensue yet again.) I digress through the events of the game you find new friends, new enemies, and many plot twist with these characters, and the currency in this game is Blood Diamonds which you find all across the map and from completing missions. If you read my little ♥♥♥♥♥♥ review from the beginning you'd understand what I mean, it's pretty ridiculous, what starts as a little fire now consumes your entire screen. Now then the combat in this game I thought was pretty well for this game because there was a lot of realism for the time for example your gun would jam and you'd have to unjam it in the middle of a firefight (now you could avoid this altogether by getting a new version of the gun from your gun stash) or you'd find enemies weapons that are so rusty that litterally sometimes after 5-6 shots after you picking it up it just keeps jamming up and you scream ''WTF'' (you will do this trust me). Let me think ah yes! The RPG's in the game quite fun instruments, but just as dangerous! You could shoot a dud and then be like me and run away screaming or sit there like an idiot... Your call... the other thing it would do is start you on fire and you can easily put it out by using the healing animation. Now then moving on to Multiplayer... Just wow the creativity of people's imagination just blew me away! People were creating maps such as D-day with such realism you could look into a history book and it look the same, I always loved those kind of people when it comes to games where you can create such things, I certainly wish I could have that kind ability or at least a little bit of it haha. Onwards we go though, the multiplayer back then was pretty fun people were nice and they also very team play coordinated (which I love in team based games instead of lone wolves {which can work depending on the game and game modes} and I don't know how it is now since I haven't played multiplayer again yet due to playing with friends with other games.\nFinally my score of the game: 10/10 still. I enjoyed litterally every part of the game, the characters, the story, the twists, and also being able to find some crazy ♥♥♥♥ that goes on in here.","November 14, 2014","true","1.0"," 312 of 384 people (81%) found this review helpful 46 people found this review funny","81","312","384","46","13"

Forget the super mutants and crazy scientists, and get prepared for arguably the most authentic game representation of an African civil war.\n\nStory:\n\nIn Far Cry 2 you can choose to be one of 9 pre-created characters, and while the choice itself will not have any real impact on the outcome of the story, the characters have interesting backgrounds and the ability to choose definitely improves the immersion.\n\nHowever, no matter who you choose, you will be a mercenary, sent to assassinate the Jackal, a notorious arms dealer who is arming both warring African factions, the UFLL and the APR… (the remaining characters will also show up in the game, as “buddies”, and they will help you throughout your progress). Of course things will go wrong, very wrong, and you will find yourself in the middle of a bloody war, AND sick with malaria.\n\nThe story is exciting, and unique. Forget the good guy(s) who fight(s) the honorable war against the evil enemy kind of stuff... In Far Cry 2 everyone is a corrupt, backstabbing son of a b****,  and as you progress through the main plot you will realize that there is no good or bad choice, there is only bad and bad, and there is nothing you can do about it. Definitely not your average approach, but you know you are dealing with something unique when you get a Nietzsche quote right at the beginning of the game…\n\n10/10\n\n\nVisuals:\n\nFar Cry 2 could obviously not  keep up with today's AAA games in terms of graphics, but maxed out it still looks very good. The African wilderness is very well depicted and diverse, with deserts, vast savannas, and jungles, and lively with several forms of wildlife running all around the place. The towns are filthy and dilapidated, with signs of poverty and war visible everywhere. On top of that, Far Cry 2 also has a live day-night cycle which is not only visually pleasing, but also adds a lot to the immersion.\n\nWhile I was more than satisfied with the visuals of the Dunia Engine, I did have some problems when enabling DirectX 10, which was causing seemingly random crashes on Windows 7 64 Bit Ultimate. On Windows 8.1 64 Bit Pro the problem disappeared…\n\nAll in all, nice visuals, with some technical hiccups here and there. Today's computers should run it without any problems even on maximum details (for reference, you can check test system specifications at the bottom of the review).\n\n8/10\n\n\nGameplay:\n\nFar Cry 2 follows the path created by the first Far Cry in terms of gameplay, but it also polishes and adds a number of new features to it. The world is truly open and huge (50 square kilometers) and provides a ton of things to do.\n\nYou get a decently long main story with varied and interesting missions, and plenty of side quest from weapon dealers (who will reward you with new weapons), from buddies (who will reward you with safe house upgrades) and from the locals (who will reward you with malaria medicine). And on top of that, you have a lot of miscellaneous “quests” as well, like diamond searching and outpost scouting.\n\nYou can probably rush through the game in 15 hours or so, but you can easily spend 50+ hours and still have things to do.\n\nBut this is an FPS, so what about the weapons? No need to worry, the weapons are also varied (from pistols and sub machine guns to assault rifles, sniper rifles, light machine guns and even exotics such as the flame thrower and the mortar) and provide several ways of combat. It’s up to you to decide whether you will try to dispatch your foes from far or in a bloody close combat. Stealth however didn’t really work for me, and as far as I can tell, the developers didn’t want to make it a really viable option… something I can understand in a way, this is a civil war after all. Still, it’s fun to shoot, the weapons are quite realistic (don’t expect an ArmA type of game though) and the flame thrower is really awesome, even if not very effective actually.\n\nStill, this wouldn’t be a Far Cry without vehicles, right? Right! You also have vehicles in Far Cry 2, from small cars and modified assault trucks to boats and gliders… and while they feel completely arcadish, trust me, you will be thankful for them as the distances can be really huge.\n\nUnfortunately however, Far Cry 2 has its problems as well. Some of the side missions become repetitive after a while, the weapons have a degradation system which is interesting, but way too fast, the AI is simply painfully stupid sometimes (although when it works, it will surprise you…) and… well you have the “outpost system” which is one of the most frustrating features I have ever seen in a game. There are dozens of outposts scattered throughout the map, manned by the soldiers of the warring factions who will shoot you on sight. While the concept does make sense, and clearing the outposts is fun at first, they will soon become frustrating because of their insane re-spawn rate… it’s really not fun to clear out an outpost, walk away a couple hundred meters and come back to find it fully manned again. Ubisoft, this was really stupid!\n\n8.5/10\n\n\nSound:\n\nIn terms of music and sound effects Far Cry 2 is above average. While the soundtrack isn’t really memorable, the African tribal theme is pleasant and adds to the immersion, and the environmental and combat sounds are actually quite good. Unfortunately the dialogs are a bit soulless which sometimes kills the characters.\n\n8/10\n\n\nReplay value:\n\nWhile the plot is linear and there aren't any choices which would significantly change the outcome (which was done on purpose as far as I can tell, because in the end Far Cry 2 is story oriented and has a very strong message to communicate), the game provides countless possibilities, and can easily suck you in, making the game worth returning to.\n\n9/10\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nFar Cry 2 is a very good game, with a unique setting, a unique plot, and a strong message which raises some very interesting moral questions. And while it might be a bit outdated by today’s standards, it’s definitely one of those games which you have to play at least once.\n\nI really recommend it if you are willing to invest some time into it, and if you are interested in something different, something special. If you are looking for a simple “tunnel shooter” however, you might get somewhat disappointed.\n\n8.5/10\n\n\n\nTest system specifications:\n\nAMD FX-8350 (OC @ 4.6 GHz); 8 GB DDR3 RAM @ 1866 MHz; AMD Radeon R9 280X (AMD Catalyst 14.4), Windows 7 64 Bit Ultimate / Windows 8.1 64 Bit Pro.","October 24, 2014","true","63.2"," 248 of 299 people (83%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","83","248","299","3","15"

It was driving slower than it usually did. I had just survived a brief skirmish with some trigger-happy hooligans, but with one quick grenade under their Jeep, the problem was solved. I saw a guard post up ahead.\n\n"Piece of cake." they said. "Clear it with that shotgun you just bought." they said.\n\nI jumped off the Jeep and pulled out my shotgun. It really was a thing of beauty, a work of art: it was ornately decorated with what looked like silver on an African or Brazilian wood with a reddish hue. The sound of it being fired was pleasant but aggressive, kind of like gangsta rap or heavy metal. It was brand new, and I decided to affectionately name it Ho Lee Schitt, after my adoptive father from China.\n\nI sprinted over there. "YIPPIE-KI-AYE-AY ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥S" I screamed, in my best Bruce Willis voice. "It's time to ♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥♥ up!"\n\nBut then, I realized the harsh reality of what was coming. I had limited ammo, and no grenades or molotovs. I had the rapt attention of about five heavily armed people who I had just threatened. The fastest means of escape I had was a small dune buggy on the other side of the shantytown. Malaria struck me almost instantly, and I heard the roar of a Jeep's engine. I felt a sharp pain overwhelming the entire left side of my body as I lost my grip on Ho Lee Schitt.\n\n"HO LEE SCHITT! NO!" I screamed. and then I felt myself get smashed to the ground by a heavy steel chassis, and everything went black.\n\nBut not for long! One of my buddies that I met earlier just came to pick my pathetic, lumpy body off the ground and save my life.\n\n"Ol' buddy, ol' pal!" I was able to whisper to myself with all of my energy.\n\nEverything went black again, but only for about five seconds, and I saw my buddy, courageously fighting off my enemies with a rusty old pistol like the independent woman she was.\n\nBut then I noticed her struggling. She left my body on the ground as she had to load her last magazine into the pistol. Odds were, one of us or both of us were going to die, and I was determined that if any of us were to die, it would not be her.\n\nSo I bit the bullet and looked at my leg. It was surely broken, but there was a bullet hole in it, too. I couldn't just leave this bullet there, so I performed a brief, gory self-surgery with my trusty machete. She noticed that I was coming to, and decided to give me the gun.\n\n"Go!" I yelled. "Go into that house over there for safety. If one of us dies, it will not be you!"\n\nI saw as a bullet was fired into my left arm, which I noticed was also probably broken. I shoved my finger through the bullet hole and pushed the bullet out, leaving a clean hole in my arm.\n\nI collapsed to the ground, like some fat guy in dire need of doughnuts. I realized that I was going to die of malaria-induced lead overdose if I didn't get up, so I popped my last malaria pill and stabbed a morphine syringe in my arm.\n\nI arrogantly belted out, in my best James Brown voice, "AND I FEEL GOOD! I KNEW THAT I WOULD NOW."\n\nThen I saw it. Ho Lee Schitt was in the hands of one of my enemies. I was furious. I ran over to the dune buggy I saw, jumped on it, and ran him over. He was crawling on the ground begging for mercy. I crouched next to him, and shot him once in each eye. Ho Lee Schitt was mine again.\n\nI ran over to the two remaining men, murder in my eyes, and my tongue stretching out longer than Ace Frehley's. They each had a clear shot on me, and i risked getting buckshot all over my face and the "PIMP" tattoo on my licker; however, their rusty shotguns jammed, obviously because the bullets were scared of me. A quick bang here and a quick bang there and there were two less idiots in the world.\n\n"AND I FEEL NICE! LIKE SUGAR AND SPICE!" I continued to sing. The adrenaline was coursing through my veins, and I jumped up in the air and high-fived my buddy. We stayed in the air for a full minute, like the end of some Van Halen concert on MTV or the closing credits of literally every episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. I was Born To Run, and against the better judgment of my friend, I kept rolling on that Thunder Road to the place beyond that guard post: New Jersey.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"gr8 8/8 m8" - IGN\n\nThis game is amazing, definitely the best in the series, and I dare say that it is the best FPS of 2008 (yes, I know that Call of Duty: World at War came out in 2008.

It was generally hated by the community upon release because it had nothing to do with the first game. (Which frankly isn't a bad thing.)\n\nRather, FC2 tried to take the series in a new direction. No mutants or cliche action seqences. Just gritty violent dark chaos   unfolding in the African jungles around you. The stripped down approach is quite appealing because the game seems to take itself more seriously. Putting more emphasis on tactics than just going in guns blazing.\n\nStory: You play as a hired gun that was sent by an unknown party to kill an infamous arms dealer named the Jackal. According to information provided, he is largely responsible for increasing instability inside Africa by stirring up civil wars in the country by providing weapons to both sides. Sounds easy, right? Go to Africa, find the Jackal, kill him. As you soon find out, it's not the simple. You soon start to play a part in the fate of the country and that perhaps, there's bigger problems than a person selling guns.\n\nIt's an interesting story if you're willing to invest into it. The Jackal is an interesting character to listen to as he describes his life in the country. How the increased violence and warfare is slowly tearing the country apart.\n\nGameplay: FC2 is a sandbox shooter at it's core. You're dropped into a beautiful lush world with various objectives to complete at your leisure. How you approach the goals is also up to you. Go guns blazing, go stealth, snipe, etc. As long as you got the tools, you got a plan. It's very satisfying to go in stealth and pick off guys from the darkness of the jungles. Watching them panic as their numbers get reduced one by one.\n\nOverall, I can't complain about FC2. It's a well made shooter that will keep gamers entertained for while. If you like planning attacks out and you're all about think first, shoot later. This game is up your alley.","June 2, 2015","true","10.3"," 133 of 150 people (89%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","89","133","150","2","3"

Too bad, you end up getting malaria and in need to rely on help of the local warlords. You help those guys out and get deeper and deeper into the fight between the different forces.\n\nThe game, as allready mentioned, takes place in a fictional african country. You have 2 very huge areas in which are you free to move around and shoot people and animals. You have a lot of different weapons to use, some which you can find, others which you can buy.\nYou get access to new weapons by completing side missions, same as malaria pills, which you need to survive. During your time you get to meet a few other mercenarys, some which get to be you friends and come help you in times of need.\n\nThe Story is generic, but enjoyable, same with the missions. The graphics are beautifull, the african setting totally stunning. Yo can spend an incredible huge amount of time in the game, if you e.g. play on a high difficulty, simulating maximum realsim. The engine does its best to help with that! The sound you are listening to during your playtime might be a bit generic but is very nice to listen to.\n\nMultiple possible endings complete this wonderfull game.\n\n10/10 Still the best Far Cry game i've ever played, plus one of the best SP shooters.\n\n[Hint: i've heard mods make this even more enjoyable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZachFett/recommended/19900/","ZachFett","Zach Fett","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ZachFett/","897 products in account","I've put in more than 40 hours into this game on the Xbox 360 version, as well as the non-Steam version, so don't mind the lowly 9 hours I've put into the game here on Steam.\n\nThis is a fantastic game, and I personally prefer it over Far Cry 3. I was a huge fan of the original Far Cry (no, not the one on Xbox called Instincts, but the very first one on PC!). It was a flawed but fun game, with glitchy AI but beautiful levels and an open world design, where you could do a mission multiple different ways. I was worried when Far Cry 2 was announced to be in Africa and not a tropical island like the first, and that Jack Carver wouldn't be returning. I bought Far Cry 2 anyway when it released on PC, back when games didn't always come with Steam keys.\n\nI was immediately addicted. The game is very gritty, with just about everything out to kill you. It's definitely not for casual gamers.\n\nWeapons start rusting and breaking after long uses, eventually exploding in your hand, damaging you and forcing you to scavenge for a weapon off the ground while enemies are shooting at you from all directions. Cars can start to break down, requiring you to quickly get out, pop the hood, and use your magical wrench to fix it all while enemies are driving down the road trying to find you.\n\nBones will break. Shrapnel will stab into your thigh. Bullets will require pulling out of your arm. You'll need to heal yourself, which uniquely has your character fix himself through multiple animations of ripping out large chunks of metal from his legs, bandaging himself, etc. It all looks fantastic and gives the game, as I said earlier, a very gritty feel.\n\nThe game is flawed, just like Far Cry 1. The AI is iffy. It's hard to stealth. The story isn't delivered very well. Everyone talks like they've got to get to the last rocket off Earth. There's respawning guard outposts (though you can easily go around them, to be honest). But even with all of that said, I still think the game is much more unique and fun to play compared to Far Cry 3. I love exploring Africa, it looks gorgeous. If you ask me, I think the engine they used for FC2 (Dunia Engine) looks much better than the slightly cartoon-y style FC3 had with the Dunia Engine 2.\n\nI'd recommend the game if you're looking for a different, less casual type of FPS. It's got an incredible amount of detail, the weapons are fun to use, there's some very cool features like weapons breaking down, the healing system, and the way AI interact with each other (enemies will try to drag their friends away after they've been hurt, for example).\n\nIt's a very underrated game, and I hope one day we'll get another Far Cry like this. One that isn't afraid to be different and try new things.\n\nEDIT:\n\nI recently started playing Far Cry 4 on my Playstation 4, and I just wanted to say that if you were a fan of Far Cry 2, but sad that FC3 removed a lot of the neat ideas 2 brought with it, you should definitely check out FC4.\n\nIt feels like a mix of all the things I loved about FC3 and brought back a few things I missed that FC2 had, like fire realistically spreading (FC3 sorta had it still, but it didn't work well), being able to go to sleep to change to a specific time of day, and hell, even a certain character returns from FC2! I won't spoil who it is, but it took me by surprise, since he wasn't a particularly big character in FC2. He's also the first recurring character in a Far Cry game, other than one other character who returns from FC3. Seems like Ubisoft is starting to make the games connect a bit!","October 29, 2014","true","9.8"," 113 of 129 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","113","129","0","4"

First of all, driving everywhere is mandatory, unless you use a bus station, which basically fast travels you to another bus station. However, you can't fast travel anywhere at anytime. The second con is related like I said, and it's the fact that you have to drive all the way to another underground station to get more Malaria pills. Malaria itself is an interesting part in the game and it adds to the difficulty and surprise since you might be taking out a huge army of enemies and suddenly feel the Malaria kick in. However, having to drive to an underground station to get passports and then travelling to another Underground station to give the passports and get the pills, is a huge detour that could have been avoided.\n\nThe Pros:\nThis game's positives overwhelm the negatives by far. The physics engine is absolutely perfect and it's undeniably better than Far Cry 3 and 4's since almost everything is dynamic. That means you can use fire for your advantage, unlike 3 and 4 where fire just spread everywhere randomly around the source of the fire. In Far Cry 2 since the environment is dynamic, by looking at how the wind blows (grass and trees' leaves can indicate that since they are moving n/s/w/e) you can actually use fire to your advantage and trap enemies inside a fire circle that's getting closer to them by the second.\nAnother notable pro is that Far Cry 2 has a great gameplay that makes sure you're never bored. Malaria, Weapon jamming, respawning camps (some people find them annoying but we could all see how dead the island was in Far cry 3 after all camps were captured), a great arsenal of weapons, and of course, much fun with the flamethrower. It's also worth noting that Far Cry 2 in Infamous mode is an extremely hard challenge for all players and it can generate Dark Souls level of rage, which means the game actually respects the player and doesn't just ask you to be a Rambo in Africa.\n\nOverall, this game is great and the atmosphere are well as the gameplay itself show its true quality.\nAlso, no Uplay! 11/10.","April 10, 2015","true","42.8"," 127 of 151 people (84%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","84","127","151","7","11"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972258172/recommended/19900/","76561197972258172","[Snizza] EyesofWrath","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197972258172/","454 products in account","Far Cry 2 is rather an anomaly amongst AAA releases, and - in light of Ubisoft's more recent games - a world away from their typical modus operandi in the way it presents an uncompromising and utterly standout creative vision, ridden all the way to completion.\n\nIt's not a perfect game - there are a number of features that are evidently only partially implemented and have little effect on gameplay (the buddy system, the reputation system, the malaria), and the story and characters are lacking to say the least. But, what it lacks in narrative it makes up for in atmosphere and pure creative integrity.\n\nI've never played a game that so accurately recreates the FEEL of a real-world location as Far Cry 2 does Africa. Whether the sun is rising over the still river water in the morning, or setting over a fire in the dry grasslands, this game is DRENCHED in atmosphere. You can almost smell the dirt and feel the sweat dripping off you as you play. Aside from creating a living, breathing world (which, in my opinion, is one of the most important features that open-world games often fail to include), it shows that there was someone with vision that pushed the creative team to create a product that was not necessarily going to hold the hands of the player (unlike Far Cry 3 with it's HUD crammed full of indicators telling you what to do and when). For Ubisoft to make such a choice and release a game which may not have been accessible to every single walking, talking wallet is, in light of their recent history, utterly mind-boggling, and I applaud the team behind this game for their efforts.\n\nEverything else aside though, the game is genuinely well-made - the core features all work wonderfully, with solid gunplay, responsive driving, and a well-designed sandbox that rewards exploration with many distinct and beautiful locales.\n\nThe enemies are aggressive and unforgiving, typically forcing you to plan your attacks and prepare the right weapons for the job - it's so rewarding when a plan comes together. Equally rewarding, however, are those moments when you're caught unprepared - perhaps you only have a sniper rifle, a pistol, and some molotovs, and are caught from behind by a number of enemies, so you start frantically flinging molotovs in the direction of the enemy who are somewhere out there in the bush, as you relocate. You find a new spot and look back to see the bush ablaze and enemies fleeing, some already dead in the fire. These moments of pure, unscripted tension and excitement are what makes this game far deeper than it would seem on the surface, and this is perhaps why this review is littered with anecdotes. Because this is a game that creates anecdotes organically.\n\nOf course, with Far Cry 3 they made a number of changes that made it more accessible, but less memorable in my opinion - in favour of a realistic setting they crafted a cartoonish tropical island, in favour of a do-it-yourself mission style they filled the HUD with feedback and mission markers, in favour of challenging fights and impressive AI they put enemies in brightly coloured shirts who bum-rush you the second you fire a bullet, and on top of that they littered the world with meaningless fetch-quest items. It's not to say that I think FC3 is a bad game, but I find myself getting bored quickly every time I play it. Far Cry 2, however, is a game in which the fun one has is limited only by the player's imagination and creativity.\n\nThe thing is, in its quest for realism, and its lack of strong narrative, I find the game actually offers the player a freedom that few other games genuinely do. The side missions are typically pretty bland, yes, but the strength of the world design and the freedom that you're offered means that there are quite literally countless ways to finish them. So you need to assasinate a target? Perhaps you block the road with your car and lie in wait to ambush him. Perhaps you wait until night and sneak in with a silenced pistol. Perhaps you snipe him from a nearby hillside. Perhaps you trap him in grassland and set the countryside ablaze. Perhaps you stride in with an RPG and just blow him the hell up. Even the way you choose to get to the location is undecided - do you drive the quickest route? Do you take the long way off road to avoid the checkpoints? Do you hop in a riverboat and take a shortcut downstream? You're given a target on a map, and complete freedom to traverse a believable world from then on.\n\nAnd even though I will criticise the lack of characters and story, the characters that are there feel like real, shady people. The main antagonist (although he is no Vaas) is enigmatic, and his cynical and exhausted outlook on the world becomes genuinely affecting as the game progresses, and I find that the thread of narrative that exists actually leaves you thinking about the real world situations that exist right now in so many African nations.\n\nIt's clear that have a deep affection for this game, and that may be taken as bias by some, but it's an affection that was hard-won from release day as I slowly got used to Ubisoft's take on the franchise, unravelled the features of the game, and then began exercising my complete freedom to explore and manipulate the vast and beautiful landscape. This is a testament to what a strong creative vision can do to a AAA release, and while it might not go down in history as a particularly successful iteration, I feel that Far Cry 2 is one of the most criminally underrated games ever released and I defy any player not to be caught staring in awe as the sun rays filter through the canopy overhead.\n\nI highly recommend this game to anyone looking for a dirty, gritty, realistic shooter in an incredibly immersive world that lays the tools on the table, and lets the player decide what to do with them.","November 27, 2014","true","6.2"," 78 of 87 people (90%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","90","78","87","2","5"

The enviroment is dynamic and beautiful, albiet sometimes locked in and small. The tactic of creating bush fires to devastate enemies has become a godsend for me.\n\nMalaria is a topic all on it's own. Deadly, realistic and game-changing at times, it hosts a brand new, rarely implemented idea that is interesting as it is deadly.\nUnfortunately, this concept is also extremely annoying and frustratingly good at stopping progress. You have to constantly backtrack to get new pills and it tends to pop up during important moments in conflict, costing you a lengthy retreat or a undeserved death.\n\nAnother issue i found was that the game feels.... crowded. You cant drive 500 yards without hitting another guard post (there are 63 in the map!) or enemy patrol. And once spotted, prepare to be tirelessly chased down and shot at until you are, injured and with a smoking engine, forced to pull over and face the threat. You can scout these posts and keep them from respawning soldiers, but it's a lengthy, time consuming process that takes away from the air of flowing gameplay and beauty otherwise found in Farcry 2.\n\nWhen it comes to guns, theres a LOT. So much different weapons and tools to use, so little time. From flare guns to rocket launchers, you will never have to worry about getting bored. The weapon unlocking system is fun but a bit tedious, and it seems to be a magnet for the ever-so-present danger of malaria.\n\nThe story is less implemented and less of a focus, allowing you to create your very own path to find your conclusion. This may seem to make the game "offset" at times but it also makes Farcry seperate from other "Go here, do This." games like Battlefield, Call of Duty and Halo.\n\nVehicles are fun, relatively diverse, and suprisingly fragile. It only takes a few wild bullets from a machine gun to turn your beautiful safari ride into a smoking husk of a truck. Return fire is not an option unless you stop the vehicle.\nGliders are fun and a great way to get from place to place. Be careful when getting off them though!\n\nMap creator is absolutely astounding! Fluid controls and a large array of options can make anyone into a professional map creator. I've spent a good long time building maps and playing on others.\nIt is quite possible to never play the same map twice in mulitplayer.\n\nAll in all, this game has it's pitfalls, but the pro's outway the con's. This game is interesting, breathtaking and unique. I love playing Farcry 2 and im sure you will two.","December 19, 2013","true","37.3"," 57 of 63 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","57","63","0","0"

Some people have called it a central African truck driving simulator rather than a first person shooter, and it all depends on how you look at the gameplay mechanics. It has a lot going for it with the open world, letting you tackle the missions as you prefer. The graphics and the African setting looks great. The game has a lot of features that really immerse you in the game, as the lack of minimap, instead utilizing a map you actually have to equip as an item and look at.\n\nThe game puts you in a central African nation, where different factions are waging war at each other, and your mission is to stop the arms dealer supplying both sides. You have "buddies" helping you with missions (giving you optional ways to tackle the main missions) as well as giving you side missions of their own. They will also help you out of trouble if you get shot down.\n\nIt's up to you to choose how to tackle each mission: get to the mission in an open world, utilizing buses for instant fast travel to a few set locations, otherwise the other vehicles available or going on foot, then finishing the mission objective in the way that best suits your playing style. Stealth, guns blazing, a tactical approach with grenades/molotovs to smoke the enemies out, or any other way? Your choice. Getting to the point of interest for each mission can take 1-4 minutes per mission, and sometimes involve shootouts as you get discovered by enemy patrols or checkpoints.\n\nThe story sets out ambitious but doesn't hold together all that well. Most of the game is standard missions that are somewhat similar. One odd thing is that the DVD release of the game required the developers to speed up all recorded dialogue to make it take up less space. This is also in the steam version of the game. The fast talking NPC:s sound really odd!\n\nThere are four things I got tired of while playing the game:\n1) Guards at guard posts always shoot at you, if you clear them out while passing they respawn until next time you pass.\n2) Enemies locate you way to easy, and fire at you with expert aiming, even almost dead enemies seem to have no problem hitting you with handguns at 300m range.\n3) Some enemies (this gets more frequent later in the game) can take almost a whole clip of ammunition before going down.\n4) If you do the buddy quests for the main missions, it can get quite tiresome to get to 3-4 different locations (some times at different sides of the map) to prepare everything needed for completing the main mission in an alternate way.\n\nI found out the perfect solution for problems 1-3: Dylan's Far Cry 2 Realism Mod 1.4. It fixes the stealth, the enemy health and the checkpoints (you can pass checkpoints without being fired upon most of the time). The game also gets a lot harder since your health is reduced as well (remember to save a lot), but much more satisfying. You're best off planning your assault, and it's really satisfying approaching an objective, taking out a few guards from afar with a sniper rifle, staying hidden to not draw enemy fire, then moving in closer and finishing the last guards off at close range with a silenced sub machine gun. You also come to appreciate strategic advantages as an elevated position. One of my best experiences with the game was behind cover with an assault rifle at an elevated position, moving from cover to cover, mowing down the enemies below. All the time the action being really tense since you know that getting hit by one or two bullets can end it all, so all firefights are really tense. At moments like these the game is glorious.\n\nI would really recommend the realism mod, and the game requires a bit of patience. For the right player, driving to each mission, sometimes avoiding (or taking out) enemy patrols along the way just builds up the tension, but will be tedious for other players, so you have to ask yourself if the way the game plays suits your taste.\n\nExcept for running the realism mod, my recommendation would be to skip most of the buddy quests. It gets far to tedious to do them all, and the rewards aren't that great. The pacing is much better if you just stick to the main mission most of the time (ignoring the complaint calls you get from the buddy).\n\nFar Cry 2 is one of the best FPS games I've played, and also one of the most immersive games of all genres. It has a few drawbacks, mostly solved by the realism mod, and it requires the right player for the game, it isn't for everyone. If you want all action all the time, it isn't the game for you, but the realistic and short but immersive and tense firefights this game can offer are hard to beat if you're in to that kind of action.","December 27, 2014","true","45.5"," 47 of 51 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","47","51","2","0"

It's worth $10. More than many of the other $10 games I have. Check out the videos on the store page and see for yourself. I've not tried mp yet. Not sure there is anyone playing mp?\n\nAs for online game play, I didn't buy it just for that. I got it for the single player experience, only. I looked and there is no one that I know of, playing online these days. If you want to play online, you'll have to create a LAN server and play with friends. I have none around me that play these games or, any games at all that I know of?\n\nAll-in-all, the game has a good SP experience if you like playing single player games. It will give you plenty of play time and it's open world to do as you please. Nothing runs in any perticular order, just play the game the way you want to, there's no time limits in it for missions or the like. Side missions are of your choosing and not mandatory. The game plays the way you want to play it. Your decisions are your own. However, your enemies are still your enemies.\n\nThere's several mods for the game and a map editor for it so, do as you wish.\n\nBy-the-way, you can launch your own dedicated server through the start window.","December 7, 2013","true","144.3"," 46 of 54 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","46","54","0","11"

I just cannot stop playing it and kept going on for hours.\n\n\nWhat the game did right:\n\nThis game is similar to its predecessor but expands the limited open world that the first Far Cry game was trying to construct on.  The environment is now far more diverse, ranging from dry savannahs to humid jungles with thick vegetation.  There is also a dynamic weather system in which fog can overtake the land or a rainstorm can appear and change the way you play.\n\nAdding to its wide ranges of landscapes, I can argue one of the more "tactical benefits" this game boasts is its fire.  A lot of games have a blaze kept at a constant size but FC 2 offers greater realism in that part. Throw a Molotov Cocktail at a dry patch of grass and see the fire consume the grass with its voracious appetite but in a humid climate, it will inflict little damage.\n\nThe A.I. of your enemies are no longer the same "dimwits" that got slaughtered in FC 1. If you're spotted out in the open or make too much noise near guard posts, they will come for you. They also converse with each other and try to protect themselves from the player which reflects real life. In one instance, a downed mercenary will be helped by another merc.\n\nStealth has been improved. If you're careful enough, your reward is being able to silently take down one enemy after another. For the most part, their awareness is fairly balanced, unlike FC 1 in which the mercs couldn't tell if someone else was firing a loud weapon but still could see the player behind tents and bushes. Also, your choices on when to use stealth makes a big difference. For example, you can go at night where potential assailants cannot easily see you but are alert.\n\nA unique feature that FC 2 has is its buddies. They are in the game to help you with missions, increase your reputation by providing optional quests, or save you if your well-being has been thrashed to zero. I do enjoy interacting with them upon taking missions.\n\nWhen combining the aforementioned aspects, you can do missions with almost any mentod you want.  You can either quitely sneak past foes or go in guns blazing. It's all up to you. Exploring doesn't easily get dull and the replay value is high.\n\n\n\nWhile I do favor this game, some problems are existant.\n\n\nWhat the game should have avoided doing wrong:\n\nThe voice acting for most of the characters is inauspicious. Most of the characters speak too fast and have a flat tone. One of your buddies' dialogue sounds like it was taken from Google translate and that makes it inauthentic.\n\nOver time, the side missions get repetitive. The "convoy missions" are the most subjected to this.  It gets quickly mundane to find circling rival arms vendors and blow up their trucks. The worst part is if you want to have better weapons sooner, there's no other way around this other than to proceed through the main objectives most of the time.\n\nThe "weapon degradation system" is one that I have debated in choosing if it's interesting to keep in a game or conclude it's mostly annoying to have in a firefight. As of now, I have decided that it's a nuisance as some weapons degrade too quickly and jam at the worst times. Also, close to the end of the game, even with reliability upgrades, the game will punish you if your shots miss too much and you cannot obtain new weapons (unless you stored them).\n\nAlso, the malaria mechanism is very annoying, with no way to ever stop it, only delay it. When you're under attack by that damn disease, you can barely see well and cannot sprint away from danger. Although it doesn't last that long, it may cost some precious seconds for you to flee.\n\nThe diamond cases in this game may somewhat excite newcomers for a while but it's painful to endure when trying to reach for some diamonds on a cliff. Although not necessary to find, it's just a distraction from what the game can truly offer.\n\nI did mention you can interact with your buddies, but that's very limited.  All you can do is accept 2 of their quests and after that, they will just say "hi" if you meet them regularly.\n\nThe (re)spawning of enemy mercenaries in certain locations is downright stupid. In one case, you can take down all enemies in a base but when you leave for a certain distance and look back with a scope, the place is then refilled with enemies as if nothing has happened. The developers should have put a time limit in how fast enemies can respawn when you're sufficiently far away.\n\nThe A.I. is good when confronting them but when they drive, it's a mess. The drivers tend to have problems in making a  U-turn and are horrible in judgement. One time, a patrol car tried to run me over but it missed and plunged into the water.\n\nFinally, the storyline is woefully linear. Though understandable, your choices are very narrow and don't have much impact on the game. Trying to avoid providing spoilers, it's the same "bad" ending, if you decide to detonate some explosives or bribe some border guards to help out a fleeing country in need.\n\n\nOther:\n\nI haven't tried out multiplayer yet but I have heard that it's dead, which is sad. However, if you feel like allowing your imagination demanding to make a map with the African landscape, there is a map editor that is easy to use. Shamefully, it's quite limited and it's meant for multiplayer.\n\nCustomizing this game is almost impossible to do, unlike most games. For those who wish to mod, they will be sadden that this is almost unachievable. Still, there are a few mods that can enhance the game (and perhaps tweak balance), like Dylan's Realism Mod.\n\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis game is definitely worth a purchase. While it may have cons, the pros in this game will entertain you and not disappoint you for at least one playthrough. If you're bored of playing games that trap you in confined spaces, get this game and feel how open it is.","December 15, 2014","true","119.4"," 41 of 46 people (89%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","89","41","46","4","0"

The wide open spaces were enjoyeble to wander through, and though there was no variety in enemy you could create your own variety in the tactics you used to deal with them. Weapon choice seemed to have a big impact on combat, you could try and pick them off from afar with long range weapons or maybe run and gun with a shotgun and some grenades. How about starting a fire and using the resulting confusion to take advantage of the situation? Maybe just take a different route and avoid combat all together. The environments were much better looking and more varied than I expected and although there could have been more variety in the missions, I never found them to be a drag as they usually made you explore new parts of the map.","October 19, 2014","true","50.2"," 38 of 46 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","38","46","0","0"

There are 2 groups who have war against each other.\nUFLL and APR. Who is the good and the bad have you to decide even though both are not perfect.\nI personally prefer the UFLL. Only my opinion though.\nOn your way through the story you visit a lot of places and meet your buddies who help you.\nI wont say more to dont spoiler too much.\n\nThe gameplay is actually very nice. I love the first person weapon handling.\nIt feels realistic and there is a big range of weapons to choose from.\nAll being buyable in the Weapon Store for diamonds.\nThats the currency of the game.\nYou can also buy upgrades for you and your weapon.\nYour weapons degrade! Maybe too fast for some but for me its fine, especially with upgrades.\nYou can change them for free in your Weapon room and "repair" them like that.\nI wouldnt recommend using weapons of the enemies, they are weak and in bad quality.\nYou often get quests to finish certain aims. The mission variety is fine even though not big.\nBut its fine for my taste. You mostly get diamonds or medicine for completing quests.\nYou can also find collectables in the game. Diamond suitcases with 1-3 diamonds in each and Jackal tapes.\nThere is a incredible amount of this stuff. Also there are 8 gold AKs in the whole world.\nThe difficulty is higher than normal. Dont try rushing over the enemy, this mostly wont work. You always have to watch out. And the health doesnt regenerate, at least not completely. You need some sort of medics to heal yourself and you cant carry unlimited of those.\nThe open world is extremely big and you have your feet, cars, boats or the bus to reach several places.\nBusses are helpful for those who prefer fast traveling even though the busses just have 5 stations per map.\nEnough for me though. The fact that you have to travel actually I like about the game.\nIts nice visiting the landscape and I like this sort of oldschool traveling.\nSome may dont like this sort of system but I love it.\nWhile travelling you will often pass some sort of checkpoints of the enemy who will shoot you on sight.\nEach of those checkpoints have some special ammo or medicine. Mostly with around 5 enemies at each point.\nA little bit annoying about this game is the way how the Enemies respawn and hunt you with their cars after they saw you. You mostly have to kill the car until you can continue passing. Also the enemy is often faster than you. After you erased a point, the enemies will respawn fast after going away and come back and that is the most negative point about the game. I got used to it, even though I agree its not perfect. Beside of those checkpoints there are also other places which are often specially named. Places like bases of the enemy. Trainyards, camps, whatever. There are often 10+ enemies and you should watch out, most of those places you see automatically while doing missions.\nThere are also animals in the nature, around 5 sorts of animals in the whole game. Realistic behaviour and they shun humans. I often think they could add more animals and also hunting animals but on the other hand its not as unrealistic as in Far Cry 3. The animals there are to much if you ask me.\n\nThe graphics and engine in general are amazing.\nI rarely saw so much realism. The whole engine simulates real world nature. Wind, rain, sun and day cycle.\nThe graphics in general look amazing. Especially fire effects. Definitely 10/10 in terms of graphics especially for 2008.\nSome say Crysis or CryEngine 2 is better but I think they are equivalent. The Dunia Engine just has its aim on realistic day/night cylcle and weather cycle. A little part of the CryEngine is in the Dunia Engine btw!\nThe Music is also amazing and fits perfectly into the whole setting.\nThe African setting like that is pretty unique and thats great.\n\nThe Multiplayer is ok.\nSome sort of CoD sort of Multiplayer which is just more realistic in general.\nNot many people play it online anymore though.\n\nFortunes Edition DLC:\nThis is a small DLC which adds 3 new weapons, some new cars and some new Multiplayer maps.\nNothing special but not bad either.\n\nAnd now our favorite part.\nCan it compete against Far Cry 3?\nI say yes.\nIts maybe not everyones taste but Far Cry 2 counts to my favorite games and can compete against Far Cry 3.\nIt maybe doesnt have so many gameplay tweaks as Far Cry 3 but I like this rustical way how Far Cry 2 handles everything. Reminds me a little bit of oldschool games. Not a lot of gimmicks but everything thats neccessary to have a nice game. I love the atmosphere of the game. The whole nature is amazing and the music fits perfectly into the game. Maybe its even better than Far Cry 3 in this part.\n\nSome of you are maybe spoilered of Far Cry 3.\nTry ignoring the things that Far Cry 3 does better.\nI already played the game 2009 and I loved it back then.\nFar Cry 2 maybe isnt perfect but it does a lot of things right and it has a great experience.\nYou should definitely try it especially because of the price. I think the game will get 9/10 from me, maybe overrated but I think this score fits good for me.

From the AI, the weapons, the amount of immersion, graphics, story, sound, everything in this game just oozes awesomeness.\n\nThis was a game that managed to draw a fine line between what people enjoyed and didnt.  Either you absolutely hated it, or you loved it dearly, with no middleground.  Most of the complaints revolved around the respawning checkpoints, which didnt bother me because, well, IT IS a shooter afterall.  If you're playing a shooter and you're not shooting something, then it can get a little boring sometimes.\n\nFirst on the discussion list is the story.  Loosely based on the short book titled "Heart of Darkness," the story has the player hunting an arms dealer named The Jackal who supplies two rival factions with an armory to start, and continue waging war against each other.  On your journey you aid both factions in search of information of the Jackal's whereabouts.  Now, this isnt a story that unfolds like you initially think it will.  Far Cry 3's story is very similar in context, but told in a more dude-bro lingo, while Far Cry 2 does so in a rich, yet immensly dark tone that will test what kind of man (or woman) you would become in this situation.  Considering that you're thrown into a real-world senario in a fictional African country, the story is constantly unfolding without the player even knowing.  Many games these days have taught us that the story is only told through dialogue or cutscenes, but this game has a story that unfolds with every bullet you fire, and every death you cause.  It's a morailty tale that might give each player the insight as to who or what kind of person he or she is, or will become.\n\nThe gunplay is some of the best i've personally encountered in any game.  From the sniper rifles, to the assault rifles, to my personal favorite, the 6P9 silenced Makarov, every gun feels rather unique in its own right.  Each sniper rifle has a different characteristic, the 2 rocket launchers each perform differently, even (most of) the pistols perform differently.  And, of course, everyone's favorite is unlockable very early in the game:  the flare gun.  Spreading fire was the key innovative feature in this game, and when done correctly is a very strategic tactic when taking on the numerous guardposts.\n\nThe AI is unscripted and acts accordingly to you.  If you haven't engaged the targets, they talk amongst themselves.  If they think someone is nearby, they will slowly approach the location of the disturbance.  Also, your reputation determines how aggressively the AI will combat you.  The lower your reputation is means the AI will hunt you down because they dont fear you.  The higher the reputation is the more cautious they are, meaning they may find cover or try to flank you.\n\nThe graphics and sound seem very dated in 2015, but for it's time it was top notch.  Some might argue that the graphics in Far Cry 2 are better overall than Far Cry 3.  When you factor in small details like shadow resolution, texture quality, and Ambient Occlusion, Far Cry 2 does have the upper hand over 3.\n\nLastly, the immersion plays a pivotal role in this game.  There is next to no regenerating health and health is restored using syringes or water bottles.  Malaria can attack you at any given point, although as your symptoms improve the time between attacks increases.  When very low on health your character performs a "surgical technique," in what is basically described as one of the coolest animations in a video game.  Gruesome, sure.  Cool???  You bet!\n\nI've logged over 600 hours in this game on steam, and another 200+ on disk, and almost all invested in single player.  I can't even describe why i keep coming back to this game so much.  Maybe it has to do with the fact that this game allows my imagination to run wild in the combat senarios.  Maybe because the story is that engaging.  I don't know.  What i do know is that since this game came out 6+ years ago, i've only found 1 other game like it, and it still doesn't hold a candle to this sheer brilliance.\n\nAdvice for new players reading this???  Give the game some time.  Allow yourself to sink into the story and REALLY think about your every action and what it's doing to you.  Study how every decision you make affects YOU, not your character, but YOU.  And for the love of god, play with all the guns.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/recommended/19900/","Whiteswart","Whiteswart","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Whiteswart/","1424 products in account","Some kind of paradox, that game is. It takes name from very famous FPS Far Cry - and giving a very diverse experience. So, basically, like heritor of Far Cry - it sucks really. First Far Cry was in its core quite oldschool shooter (like Doom or Half Life) - just with so many fixes as one could imagine 10 years back (like outstanding physics, witty and challenging level design, clever AI behavior).\n\nThere, in Far Cry 2 - we have a nice engine, yes. AI may not be very smart... but it has some explanation by overall agenda. We're talking about setting of that game. It rests in the middle of some civil war in Africa, in one of many so called "countries" where state wasn't existed at all and people continuosly swallowing by warmonger tribes habits. That quite realistic setting lies so far from "just a tropical island afar from anywhere, where some mad doctor making a war mutants from mercs" - base of first Far Cry. But not a sip of realism made diversion between first and second games. Far Cry 2 is a sandbox. That's her bless and curse.\n\nLet's start with bad side:\nI quote there since I cannot say better: "Driving across beautiful but lifeless world while fighting infinitely respawning enemies to complete unimaginative missions for people who all try to kill you" (yougamers)\n\nWhere first Far Cry gameplot offers dramatic episodes "like in the movies", sandbox game just leaves you to entertain yourself by continuous driving through the countryside, killing almost everyone on sight. Gameplot is awful, storyline doesn't have any cultural value. Just a reference to a movie "Lord of War". Protagonist (any of them) its just a brief bio like "Tall, strong, divorced, reserved, alcohol habits". No personality besides that. Mandatory "twist" in the midst of game just slightly changing decorations, nothing more. Ok, there are some little "twists" around every story mission, but it's just a choice between two shootouts, with big blood or with much-more-than-big blood spilled. Oh, and story motivation - running from one dose of drug to another - kinda frustrating, I guess.\n\nNow, question - is it worth playing at all?\n\nWell, yeah, there is a good part.\nThis particular FPS game still a way more wiser than any flat but overrated shooters like whole bunch of Call of Duty series. While it's not as complex and addictive as Stalker games, for some points it's easily beats Ukranian games. For a start, it's size feature. Big vastes can be depressing, but, when you are planning to hit a conwoy or clear up a fortress full of soldiers all by yourself, you surely need some room for elbows (Bewegungsfreiheit, as Germans might said). And, all of sudden, moving in these vastes could be quite relaxing. Natural. Really, I've just played Far Cry for 7 hours not completing any missions. Just wandering around and collecting hidden diamonds. Game setting fits just right to simple wandering around. Almost like you're on vacation, on safari, of kind.\n\nSadly, we have a very few FPS games in one-player modus, that allows player choose it's destination, planning your moves before rushing forward in battle, and using long-range rifles from distance more than 100 meters. Project IGI comes in mind now, for some missions (not completely). Xenus (another Ukranian game) - an ambitious sandbox, but poorly executed. Op.Flashpoint/ARMA are too simulating to be fun. What else?\n\nOverall: While many find Far Cry 2 too boring, it has it's own place. Like it was with Assassin's Creed 1, which too was a pretty boring sandbox. If you can look behind its bad sides, game's good one.\nFair 7.5/10 in my collection.","March 29, 2014","true","15.1"," 77 of 117 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","77","117","0","4"

You are able to use a primary, a secondary, and melee weapon along with a special weapon including grenades and molotovs. It is a big open world and your main means of travel is by various types of vehicles. To add a bit of realism, guns will jam and explode after awhile of prolonged use.\n\nUnlike its predecessor you can have buddies that protect you and help you on missions. You can pick which character you want to be, though it doesnt really change the outcome. Also unlike its predecessor the setting is completely different as it takes place in Africa and not on tropical islands out on the pacific ocean. While alot of people showed disdain for this setting change, i actually liked the setting and enviroment.\n\nThe story of Farcry 2 is gathered via information when you accept missions or when you find cassette tapes left behind by the games main Antagonist "The Jackal". Essentially the lore of this game is in the background and you have to research it and pay attention to understand whats going on.\n\nFarcry 2 still holds up well in its Graphics Department for a game from 2008. The Dunia Engine makes use of fire elements burning the enviroments grass and trees, as well as showcasing a day and night cycle and weather effects not present in the previous game. As for the sound design the explosions, guns etc are all top notch while the voiceacting is pretty decent. A few music tracks caught my attention in this game; i really enjoy the calm music transition to the fast battle paced ones when a firefight is happening.\n\nMy only minor gripes with Farcry 2 are having to constantly get Malaria pills, and the long drives it kinda takes to get to some areas. Other that that i recommend playing Farcry 2.","October 1, 2015","true","41.2"," 19 of 21 people (90%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","90","19","21","3","0"

There is plenty of action, diamonds want to be found and the map is huge.\nUnfortunately I still find many things that I don't like and that still annoy me a lot.\n\nFirst there is the car driving, this gets annoying really quickly as you constantly have to drive from one end of the map to the other and back again. It doesn't help that you cannot truly clear out road blocks, enemies will respawn even though you have cleared the camp. You can just "scout" these camps, thats all. This way, you will have plenty of shootouts as you often have to step out of your car and kill people before you can head on. Im also missing a fast travel system to locations you have scouted or at least to safehouses. Driving becomes a chore.\n\nSecondly there is this awful map. It is a good idea, but ultimately it is obstructing your sight and is annoying. This minimap is missing several options, you as a player should have control over. Hold the GPS in one hand and a pistol in the other for instance. Or have the map in your left hand be set on the left side of the screen and not right in the middle. Or have a GTAish GPS in your HUD. Instead you can hardly see whats in front of you.\n\nThe buddy system is interesting, but ultimately lacks the immersion to bond with your partner(s), they seem expendable and are badly written.\n\nThe story is bland: Kill the Jackal. I'm totally missing storyline here, that leads you through the game, tells you an actuall story. Instead the game presents you unrelated quests of killing that repeat themselves. After all you don't even know what you are actually doing and why you are in Africa.\nAre you there for a Malaria cure, that you got there to begin with? Are you there to befriend the Jackal? Kill Factions or not? What was the purpose of it all? Bring refugees across the border?\nI thought Im a mercenary, there to make a profit, well guess I lost my identity.\n\nThe AI is pretty annoying as well, granted they try to surround you, but it seems even if you are hiding they always come from behind, spot you through obstacles and shoot you through high grass and plants where you could only make prediction shots.\n\n\nSPOILERS:\nBut the worst of all is the miraculous ressurection of your so called buddies. First they will be killed in  the bar. Then at the end every buddy is there again in a shootout for some stupid diamonds. Even if you shoot a buddy yourself during the game, but whole clips in them, they will come back.\nThis makes no sense at all, "story" or otherwise.","November 30, 2013","false","42.2"," 86 of 143 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","86","143","0","8"

Problem is two factions of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s are fighting over all the rusted scrap metal and rocks you see throughout the landscape. You are forced to work for both factions and no one seems to notice the fact that you're working for both of them until the end of the game. Like what the ♥♥♥♥, nobody in either of the factions noticed that the guy working for them just ♥♥♥♥ed up their generic bad dude grunts for the 50th time.\n\nAlso there's malaria, because some ♥♥♥♥wit in Ubisoft decided that running to the church each time you run out of your prescription pills to fight off your malaria induced seizures and doing some lame, repetitive mission was a good idea. Yeah, great job guys, real good.\n\nYour guns rust and break and ♥♥♥♥ which is pretty neat because it makes using enemy weapons a gamble because they can jam and ♥♥♥♥ you in your ♥♥♥ in a fight. Instead you buy your own weapons using some sketchy black market and some blood diamonds you find sacttered across the countryside that 12 children died trying to mine in a Congolese slave mine.\n\nThe generic African country makes for a pretty dope map. There's deserts, savannas, jungles and more. Also thre's outposts. ♥♥♥♥ING OUTPOSTS. Every time you clear one the enemies just respawn. Like how many of these ♥♥♥♥ers are fighting here? How do they manage to return to each outpost 5 seconds after you just blew the ♥♥♥♥ out of it with an RPG? There's towns too but they're pretty lifeless, just more generic mercenary guys standing around.\n\nThere aren't a lot of menus in the game. You press a button to bring up the map in your generic mercenary dude's hands and you actually have to look down at it. It's neat but it makes driving a ♥♥♥♥♥. There's some fast travel but only to certain points on the map for all you ♥♥♥♥♥♥ who like driving 40 miles in a game just to get to the mission and die immediately to do all of that driving again. Immersion!\n\nYou also have some people you meet in the game which are called buddies that can come save you when you get downed by enemies. They can actually die and when they're dead they're dead for good, which is pretty neat. They also help you out in missions with different approaches and ways to earn more Congolese slave diamonds. Once again, the buddies are all generic mercenary dudes. They try to inject some character into them but it doesn't really work out. I only liked the old Yugoslavian guy out of all of them.\n\nThere are wild animals too like zebras and whatnot but they just stand around and watch all the dumb♥♥♥♥♥ fighting over nothing.\n\nAnyway its a pretty sweet game, get the Fortune Edition because you get an OP ♥♥♥ crossbow with exploding bolts which is just sick. Basically the game has everything; war, exploration, jungles, gunfights, companions, generic mercenaries, a pretty cool story once you get into it, and infectious disease. Something for everyone and definately recommended for the best Africa experience in a game yet.","December 3, 2014","true","4.4"," 13 of 14 people (93%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","93","13","14","4","0"

On harder difficulties, they can see through vegetation unusally well, but not consistently. They're also bullet sponges if you don't use explosives, shotguns, and sniper rifles. Sometimes they are smart and try to flank you, other times they bum rush you like it's their first time playing a shooter.\n\n- Voice acting is very odd; it feels rushed. Considering what kind of game this is trying to be though, this isn't a big deal because...\n\n- ... the plot is more of an excuse to be shooting people in Africa than an actual story.\n\n- Driving to objectives is a 'female dog' (thanks for the PG censorship on an M rated game, Valve) and a half with all the patrols and guard posts that respawn if you walk more than 100m away. I opt to go on foot most of the time becuase, aside from discovering more that way anyway, it's safer.\n\nObjective score: 8/10\n\n\nIt's a tremendous amount of fun to feel like a hunter and methodically approach every conflict, but you don't have to always be stealthy. Constatnly changing up your play style is what makes this game so much fun. It's my go-to game if I just want to relax after a hard day. I like to take my time, slowly pick guys off one by one with the dart rifle, then finish off any remaining bad dudes with a shotgun. But again, I switch it up often.\n\nSilly ways to have fun:\n+ The flare gun is a one hit kill and magically kills everyone in a car, even though it doesn't set the car on fire nor directly hit anyone inside.\n\n+The AS50 can shoot through more than one person.\n\n+ Sneak up behind an enemy, place an ied, back up, *boom*.\n\n+ I never get tired of sniping guys in boats. They fly out sideways about 5-7 feet in a perfectly straight line.\n\nSubjective score: 10/10 - Would bless the rains down in Africa again... but fire spreads more easily when it's dry.\n\nSorry I got that song is stuck in your head now :)","April 1, 2015","true","167.5"," 14 of 16 people (88%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","88","14","16","6","0"

In this war-torn African country, you are a mercenary and everyone hates you, even the warlords who employ you. You'll need a stealthy approach, but there are no detection meters, only careful attention. You'll need to trek across a beautiful open world, but there's only a paper map to get you there. You'll need money, but the only people worth saving in this country have no money, and the mission will earn you $0 on completion. The guys who have money are first justifiable, then amoral, then despicable, but by now you're hooked, and besides, the arms dealer promised you a grenade launcher if you took out his competition.\n\nHave you ever had to watch your friend die in your arms because you weren't fast enough at clearing out an enemy guard post, or because your gun jammed in the middle of a firefight, or because you had a sudden attack of malaria, or because you set the entire complex on fire and blew up the getaway car?

Which is great. Because Far Cry 1 was a mess. It wasn't inherently bad of course. Hell, it was cutting-edge at its time! But I didn't like it too much.\n\nNontheless, Far Cry 2 is just as hard as its predecessor. You're in Africa. You got malaria. Everyone wants to kill you. Ammo is scarce. Weapons jam frequently. Cars do, too. And I'm sure there's one bad person the dev team didn't like for every god damn guard post in this game. Oh the guard posts. Also, the AI is pretty good, especially on higher difficulties, making some fights seemingly impossible to win. Perfect for the masochistic player.\n\nOne could argue that the main objective of a video game is to be fun. And you would be right. Seeing all these elements in Far Cry 2 and playing it for myself I can't say the game is always "fun". The game can be a frustrating, challenging and enraging piece of ♥♥♥♥ that slaps you for wanting to play with it. At times, Far Cry 2 doesn't like you nor does it want to play with you. Essentially, this game has a lot of conflict between casual video game fun and stress. But that's what makes this game a good game.\n\nIt's not outstandingly great, by any means. But it's pretty solid. Although a lot of the missions come down to "Kill this guy", "Blow up this thing", "Steal that thing" or "Collect 1000 of these, pretty please". Also, you drive around. A LOT. Seriously. If there would be an african driving simulator, this would be it, I can tell you that for a fact.\nYou could argue that Far Cry 2 can get boring at times. And it does, it certainly does. But then again, I've played MMOs so I'm up for the challenge. I don't get bored that easily. And if you don't get bored that easily like me, Far Cry 2 might just be the right game for you.\n\nYou like shooting guys in the face with a variety of weapons? You like burning down vehicles, small, destructible buildings, people and gas stations? You like blowing stuff up? You like a gorgeous looking open world FPS? You don't have anything against repetitive quests and objectives? Having a constant, life-threatening condition that could strike you down at any moment doesn't bother you too much? Driving around in a car that breaks down all the time due to tons of guys shooting at it is no problem for you? If you said "Yes!" numerous times in the last 20 seconds, I advise you to get this game and have fun (or frustration - who cares, both words start with f so that's fair enough) with it!\n\nI like Far Cry 2 so far and if you think like me, you will like it, too. If you don't, it can't be helped. Not everyone can have a decent taste in video games. But you'll learn, I'm sure of it.","November 23, 2014","true","22.0"," 22 of 32 people (69%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","69","22","32","4","0"

The open world activities are structured in a very simplistic way, but achieving your objectives is anything but simple. You constantly feel like you're under threat of being attacked when you're outside, and you have to spend about 15 minutes preparing for each mission. Picking and replacing your weapons and maybe even getting new Malaria pills. There's a lot to contend with, you have to take cover and buy yourself time to heal yourself, you need to make sure your weapons don't jam, and you need to defend the buddies you bring with you because they absolutely can die, leaving them gone for the rest of the game. All of this means that pulling off the missions feels INCREDIBLY rewarding.\n\nHonestly I've never played a shooter as immersive as this, and yes the malria and guard post respawn issue is annoying, but not enough to break the game entirely.

As an American male, I was raised on a steady diet of action movies and games that fed me exactly the sort of masculine power fantasy that I have come to expect from shooters.\n\nFrom classics like DooM and Duke Nukem to modern masterpieces like Medal of Honor and Call of Duty: Black Ops, games have understood that the best thing to do is inflate my ego to as big as possible by giving me complete domination over enemies and pride of place in the narrative as I, the hero, destroy all evil and save the world.\n\nThese games understand that from the day I was born, I was given toy guns to play with and taught to idolize soldiers, sheriffs, pretty much anyone in a position of authority with a gun.\n\nWhich is where Far Cry 2 drops the ball. I mean honestly this game fails so bad it's like it tries to be the OPPOSITE of a power fantasy. You show up in Africa and immediately get malaria. You screw up your mission, nobody cares about you, your guns jam, you have to scrounge for cash, your vehicles keep breaking down, and everyone wants to shoot you. You have to pry bullets out your ankle or pull them out of your arm with your teeth, and you have to watch buddies bleed to death unless you shoot them.Fire will spread unpredictably and burn you to death. AND YOU CAN'T CURE THE MALARIA. You can just keep popping pills, but to get the pills you have to do favors for an underground resistance run by the people stupid enough to stick around while two militias fight over the country.\n\nInstead of feeling like a badass when you kill guys, they cry out in pain, writhe around, and respawn 15 minutes later. You are a bad person, your buddies are bad people, and you get missions from bad people to do bad things. You deceive and kill people for no reason other than a potential meager profit. Nothing you do makes the world a better place and you never feel good about it or powerful when you do it.\n\nSo yeah, Far Cry 2, way to miss the point that basically every other FPS game in the world has understood. Other games realize that I can't get hard without getting a sweet headshot, but Far Cry 2 just makes me feel bad about shooting people. Honestly, what's the point of a video game that doesn't make me feel good about murder? That's like watching a movie where you don't get to see any ♥♥♥♥ or explosions. Lame.\n\nPlus this game is set in Africa. Who cares about Africa? Why not set your game some place cool like a tropical island? That's what made Far Cry good. Far Cry 2 is brown and sad. Far Cry was green and blue and happy! It was like a sweet vacation where you also got to kill some dudes with some rad guns. That sounds perfect, not like the miserable slog through a hot, insect infested swamp or through a scrapyard with burning tire fires that Far Cry 2 gives you.\n\nThis game is basically Blood Diamond without the feel good message at the end. Did you get to see Jennifer Connelly's ♥♥♥♥ in Blood Diamond? No. Were there explosions in Blood Diamond? A few, I guess. But still. That movie wasn't exactly as awesome as something like The Expendables. And this game is no Duke Nukem Forever.\n\nThankfully it looks like maybe Far Cry 3 realizes where Far Cry 2 went wrong and has brought us back to the "head to a beautiful island paradise, grab a bunch of sick weapons, and kill the ♥♥♥♥ out of some pirates to save your bros." Now THAT is a story I can get behind! And this time instead of African resistance fighters, there's a hot native chick who helps you out, and she's not wearing much! I mean I'm not sexist but it's good if the women in a video game are easy on the eyes. I play these things for entertainment. So with its RPG mechanics (which are great because leveling up is a great way to reinforce the power fantasy) and its return to a hero I can care about instead of the horrific mercenary with zero morals that I have to play as in Far Cry 2, it looks like Far Cry 3 is the game for me.","December 9, 2012","true","19.0"," 18 of 25 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","18","25","3","5"

You need to hunt for The Jackal, which is apparently giving guns to both sides of the factions in the war. You do missions for both sides to progress through the game. The game is divided into different Acts, which is interesting. Between the North and South of the map you will experience a loading screen, this doesn't bother me too much, because I don't go between the North and South frequently in this game.\n\nPros:\n-Great graphics for an older game, still hold up well in 2014\n-Good story\n-Very realistic setting, has awesome enemy AI and your gun can jam\n-MASSIVE map, seriously this map is huge. I'm not sure how it is compared to other games though.\n-Gets on sale for very cheap\n\nCons:\n-Malaria, pops up alot. Pretty annoying\n-You'll be driving alot\n-Enemy outposts respawn way to frequently, if you go away from an outpost for a few minutes and come back then it will have tons of enemies in it again.

Set in a war-torn African country, there's a wide variety of places to see: from deserts, to deep jungles, small towns...\n\nThe story is pretty good. You arrive at this country in order to kill the Jackal, the guy who armed both sides of the conflict. Things go wrong, and you end up taking jobs from the different factions in order to gain their trust, and, in exchange, getting information about your target. Luckily, you're not alone in this mission; although the troops will shoot you on sight even if you're working for them, you'll still come across several buddies (foreigners, just like you) who will help you out during missions.\n\nThere's plenty of stuff to do in this game. Besides the main missions, there are different missions you can take, including taking convoys transporting weapons, assassinating certain targets, and helping your buddies out. Also, you'll encounter enemy outposts, and, although taking them out is fun, they respawn quickly, which gets tiring after some time, and you'll end up trying to use fast travel (which, by the way, is only available at certain locations, in the form of bus stops) as much as you can to avoid the outposts.\n\nThe environment, as mentioned, is quite varied, and the map is huge. You can move around it using different vehicles, including jeeps, trucks, quads, boats, to name a few. You can unlock safehouses on the different areas, and there's hidden stuff to look for.\n\nAnother interesting mechanic is the sickness level: your character is infected with malaria, and there's nothing you can do to cure it, you can only take pills in order to control it. While it's an annoyance most of the time (especially if you have a malaria attack right in the middle of a firefight), it's still an interesting mechanic. There's also weapon degradation, meaning that you'll need to get new weapons from time to time, or run the risk of a weapon jamming at the wrong time. Luckily, weapons bought at stores are always available at armouries next to them.\n\nWell, in conclusion, this is a really good game, one you should really play.","December 31, 2014","true","46.8"," 9 of 10 people (90%) found this review helpful","90","9","10","0","0"

If you liked Far Cry 3/4 but found it too easy or dumbed down, you will love Far Cry 2. Lacking features such as crafting and such from the more recent games (crafting is too overrated), it gives you a gritty experience of guerrilla warfare in an African state.\n\nI'd recommend playing with Dylans Realism Modification (gives the game an extra tweak to make you plan your attacks)\nI'd also recommend installing Far Cry 2 Graphical Enhancement Suite (to make sunsets and the overall atmosphere look even more beautiful)\n\nThe game engine is solid, the only occasional physics bugs you will encounter will be when one vehicle crashes into another, or when you walk around the safe zones and the AI  occasionally gets killed by the physics objects. This can be hillariously funny, especially when the wildlife gets involved. (It doesnt happen often enough to be something to worry about, it's only happend to me about 3 times in my entire playtime).\nI have never had the game crash, ever. Even with the use of Dylans mod and the Graphical ES.\n\nThe gunplay is satisfying, people complain that jamming weapons are annoying, however if you purchase your own you will rarely or even never encounter this. I rather enjoy the weapon jamming as it makes the combat more exciting and unpredictable.\n\nThere is also a multiplayer feature for the game which you could make use of if you want to fight some friends.\n\nWith a reasonably cheap price, and occasional sales, i'd definatly recommend picking this game up.","December 29, 2014","true","52.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"

Unlike it's sequel, FarCry 3, this game feels less cartoony and emotionally vapid because it keeps the player vulnerable, evenly equiped with enemies, and isolated in the vastness of the maps. This can be frustrating at times, but ultimately (I argue) makes for a more valuable experience. Your mortality is quickly equated with that of the world's other NPCs and inhabitants, and so the destruction, or implied destruction, of those lives is more profound.\n\nWhile FarCry 3 represents a huge step forward in gaming technology and is a worthwhile experience in it's own right, it's emotional impact and themes fell flat for me because of how the game held your hand throughout and superpowered the player very quickly with outrageous rewards for menial tasks. I played FarCry 2 after finishing the third game, and felt a much deep connection to the aesthetics of this one. Although I think it's fair to say that the plot is almost non-existant, and certainly not a coherent narrative than a series of similaraly motif-ed scenes joined by some key characters and locals; the plot only really comes together toward the end of each "chapter" when the principle antagonists are reintroduced to the game after remaining shadowy figures, alluded to but not seen or felt.\n\nOverall, a fastastic game with some flaws, but one that has given me more pause to consider the real world than anything else I have ever played.","March 1, 2014","true","27.9"," 8 of 9 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","8","9","0","0"

This is because it's not only mentally exhausting, but emotionally as well.\n\nLet's get what it doesn't do well out of the way, because it doesn't do a lot of ♥♥♥♥ well. There's all sorts of fun things that people hate like weapon degredation, the malaria mechanic which gives you a vomit-tinged screen until you press H and pop a refreshing malaria-fighting Certs into your mouth, the ♥♥♥♥♥♥ open world which is full of repetitive quests that revolve around shooting the other soldiers of fortune you're working alongside of, or shooting a man in a suit, or blowing up a truck that's driving around in circles. It's really, really ♥♥♥♥ing grindy too. The secondary missions don't offer much more than just your stupid mercenary friend calling you up in the middle of your mission to ask you to do something so he can be a bigger, more amoral ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for dollars than you can. All it is is you being an unpleasant little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ for money to other unpleasant little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s also here for money.\n\nAre you still with me? Good. Because it turns out that this game has so many flaws it has essentially developed Three Stooges Syndrome, the syndrome where it has lots of bad ideas yet they all don't end up killing the game, but rather strengthening it.\n\nAll of the things up there would normally have killed my interest in this game really ♥♥♥♥ing dead. And they did the last two times I tried to play it, all the way back in 2010. But today, the game clicks for me. I don't know whether it was the depressed state I was in or whether I've realized that AAA video game design has been so design-by-committee that this was the thing I ended up dying for. This game ended up satisfying something I wasn't aware that I needed than, say, Grand Theft Auto 5 or Saints Row the Third, which are just straight-up celebrations of how awesome you are. Far Cry 2 tells you to your face that you're just another ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ in a jungle with a barely functioning weapon, and that you won't matter if you live or die.\n\nBut also at this point in time, the mental state of your mind also is very, very helpful when getting into this game. In order to actually sit down and play it, you must learn to accept the environment that the game is forcing you into. Everything is ♥♥♥♥. War is constant. The missions suck. Nothing really works. You are accepting missions in order to make like worse for everybody. Your guns get dirty really fast. You're trading rough diamonds for all the guns you can get your hands on. Absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ in buggies and jeeps and cars will drive off the road to try and run you down for no other reason than you are there, and you are a target, and everyone hates you. Everyone hates you here in Africa, and if it means that you will die so that there's one less target to shoot, you're gonna get shot. The work is absolutely repetitive, the fast travel system is the worst, and if you lose your car because some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s blew it up because they were trying to shoot you while you were using your car for cover, you're gonna have to hoof it. You are a person in a ♥♥♥♥ tornado. And the ♥♥♥♥ tornado has everyone you know and love in it. And you all can't stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ into the ♥♥♥♥ tornado. And because you all can't stop ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, the ♥♥♥♥ gets into your eyes and mouth and face and you're swearing bloody revenge on the people who keep involuntarily ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ into the ♥♥♥♥ tornado, and soon you're all at each others throats while your lives become nothing but ♥♥♥♥ and tornadoes and blood and broken teeth.\n\nThat's what it's like to play Far Cry 2. I don't recommend it for everyone. Hell, I don't know who I can recommend it for. It's a great game because it evokes that experience and keeps it consistent up to the end, but it's such an unpleasant experience that I'm surprised it got published at all.\n\nBesides, didn't Spec Ops the Line do this sort of thing, but within ten hours?","February 17","true","56.6"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","77","10","13","2","0"

I saw the great reviews it got. But only 5 hours into it I had to stop playing. It was a combination of complete boredom, frustration and knowing I’ve already experienced all the game would have to offer.\n\nFar Cry 2 is a very open world game. After the first guided mission you are free to go wherever you want, which is nice. Except…\n\nHere is the formula for every Far Cry 2 mission I encountered in 5 hours\n+Drive to a place that has a mission available\n+Drive to the waypoint on your map for that mission. Which is always far away.\n+Get shot at driving through areas you’ve already cleared.\n+Repair your vehicle.\n+Take down a random vehicle with a turret.\n+Repair your vehicle.\n+Complete mission.\n\nThat’s it…that’s how it was for 5 hours before I knew that was all the game had to offer and show me.\n\nI might have been able to push through if the missions were close to one another. But, there’s SO much driving in this game. I didn’t mind that in itself. The fact that it’s not even enjoyable really killed it for me. I thought after clearing a checkpoint it would be good from then on out…WRONG. Enemies always respawn everywhere. Which means you get in constant battles when you just want to drive through an area you already cleared. It makes me feel like I’m not accomplishing anything and gives me no incentive to kill enemies. I just resorted to flying through the checkpoints and killing any vehicles that gave chase to me.\n\nFar Cry 2, in my opinion, commits several cardinal sins in video games.\n+Respawning enemies\n+Enemies that can hit you from a mile away, consistently. Even with a shotgun?!\n+Enemies that can instantly hit you each time you break from cover\n+Enemies that know your exact location\n\nPros\n+Open world style of gameplay\n+Graphics\n+Good shooter at its core\n+Capturing the African environment and culture\n+Music\n\nCons\n+Respawning enemies\n+Extremely repetitive gameplay\n+Too much driving around\n+Enemy AI\n+Didn't feel rewarded for doing anything\n+Strange run on sentences with the voice acting\n\n\n4/10\n\nFar Cry 2 really does have some good mechanics and systems it employs. But the negative things I mentioned above far outweigh the positives. I couldn’t continue playing and therefore can only recommend if it’s on a big sale and you’re really curious.

There are just too many immersion and game breaking bugs that will never be fixed.\n\nI'll admit, I did have fun for a while. Sneaking into a heavily guarded fort on a rainy night, killing the target and sneaking back out after only killing one guard with just a knife felt pretty awesome. But there are just so many annoying factors for the majority of the game, and let me start off with the two biggest issues:\n\nTHERE ARE PROGRESSION BLOCKING/SAVE CORRUPTING BUGS THAT FORCE YOU TO RELOAD AN EARLIER SAVE.\nAnd you have no idea when they occurred. I had this happen to me twice in one playthrough, but luckily I had many save files to fall back on and find the ones that still worked, which set me back 4 hours. I almost rage quit and I wouldn't blame anyone for doing so. Having that many save files is also annoying because it takes forever to open the load menu because each save is ~5MB. I'm not completely sure, but I noticed that when the door guards tell you to go look for a guy in captivity, your game is about to break. Look at the map to see where the buddy is, then reload a save that was before you talked to the guard and go find them on your own. I have heard of other bugs like key NPCs vanishing or just refusing to talk to you, but I did not personally experience them.\n\nTHERE IS A BUG THAT ONLY LETS YOU LISTEN TO 11/18 JACKAL TAPES.\nJackal tapes are the ramblings of the arms dealer you are sent to kill. The Jackal is the main villain. These tapes are the only way you can get inside his head and see why he behaves the way he does...and you can't get them all in the current state of the game. This is a pretty big part of the story that just goes missing, especially because those last few tapes reveal a lot about the character (because the majority of the game doesn't tell you anything story related). How do I know that? Because I looked them up on YouTube, the only way to listen to them all now.\n\nThe game crashes constantly with DX10.\nUse DX9.\n\nEnemies and supplies respawn after they go out of draw distance.\nGo too far away and come back, and they'll all be there again. Not only is this annoying when you're trying to get somewhere that involves backtracking, but it makes you feel like nothing you do matters. It just wastes your time.\n\nEnemies know exactly where you are the instant you miss.\nGood luck trying to take out a base without save-scumming. The instant you miss one bullet, they all know your exact location and start closing in and shooting even if you used a silent weapon like the dart gun. This is a glaring flaw because you have to plan your attacks on every set of enemies. They can very quickly overwhelm, flank, and kill you on higher difficulties so you must try to take out as many as possible from range. Don't even think about turning down the difficulty, because...\n\nEnemies are stupid.\nEven if you crank the difficulty up, which gives the AI the ability to flank you and such, they'll still do some really dumb stuff. I once blew up a barrel from a distance and the AI decided the best way to investigate the situation was to gather around it. About 6 guys just grouped up and I shot them one at a time. They never took cover, just spun around looking for me. On easier difficulties they'll "run" up to you, stare at you for a few seconds, then fire. They seem to have overreacted to far cry 1 difficulty complaints.\n\nCell tower and arms dealer side missions are always the same.\nThere is absolutely no variety in any of these. The cell towers have you assassinate one guy always dressed in a suit with a desert eagle in random heavily guarded areas. Sometimes he's in a car. Sometimes he's in a cease-fire zone. The arms dealer missions are EXACTLY the same: it's always blow up a truck with a technical in front and behind it driving in a convoluted circle on one of the 9 map squares. Always. There is no creativity whatsoever, and it's pure padding.\n\nMost of your time will be spent driving.\nAlmost every mission will have you travel across the whole map repeatedly, and because of respawning enemy camps this can take forever. Good luck driving through an outpost because the AI will get in their cars, cheat by going faster than you can to catch up to you, and blast you away. The only time you can "drive" past an outpost is when you go full speed in a swamp boat, the AI doesn't seem to notice/catch up in those cases. There are 5 "fast" travel points across the 9 map squares in an X shape, but that's not enough and normally you still have to do a good bit of driving to and from them. Driving in-and-of-itself is annoying as well because...\n\nVehicles have horrible behavior.\nThey struggle to go over the smallest of obstacles and handle like arcade racers. If you manage to get your vehicle stuck on a 6 inch flat rock or in a dried up river bed while it's upright you can't push it off, you just have to abandon it. But if you drive your open top vehicle off a 50 foot cliff and it ends up sideways or upside down after bouncing around a few times (not damaging your health at all) you can just go to one side and spam the use key to flip it upright. All of this is very immersion breaking.\n\nThe vehicle repair animation is stupid.\nI realize you can't expect them to put in a completely realistic fixing animation where you rebuild the engine or something, but at least have some variety. All you do is put a socket wrench on one nut and twist it for a few seconds. That's it. For every vehicle. If you get a repair manual, you twist faster, but only for that specific vehicle that the repair manual was for. Apparently buggies, ATV's, trucks, technicals, and even Jeep(TM)(R)(C)'s all have a magical nut that will instantly repair a vehicle to factory conditions when twisted. Who knew?\n\nThere are no civilians outside.\nThere is no friendly/neutral AI except the almost stationary buddies. This situation only makes sense at the very end of the game due to the story, but for practically the entire time there is no reason for it. Every single person outside is armed and dangerous. Every story mission you are an under cover operative and both sides will shoot you on sight unless you are in a cease-fire zone.\n\nThere are infinitely spawning mobs and clairvoyant AI in Cease-fire zones.\nIf you shoot anybody in a cease-fire zone, every single AI in that zone will (1) know your exact location and (2) infinitely respawn as hostile until you leave the zone and run a bit further, then you can immediately come back and they won't care. This hostile behavior happens even if nobody saw you take the shot with a silent weapon. Very immersion breaking.\n\nWeapon durability only applies to you.\nI get why durability is in the game, it makes sense to have a weapon degrade over time. An enemy's weapon never jams when he wields them. However, the instant he dies his weapon becomes utter ♥♥♥♥ and will jam like crazy until it explodes in your hands three reloads later.\n\nSome of the weapon design/behavior is horrible.\nThe two that stand out the most to me are the MGL (that revolver like grenade launcher) and the dart gun. Now I don't know too much about guns, but I do know that the MGL (1) Has 6 grenade slots and (2) reloads like a revolver. It doesn't have 4 grenade slots in a magazine style reload system. This reload animation is just insulting. As for the dart gun, apparently it's hard to carry more than 10 darts the size of bullets. What is the point of having a silenced sniper rifle if you can only use it 10 times before you need to find ammo. Not to mention the gun has the worst reliability and on easy can break before you even run out of ammo. Wut?!\n\nI'd go on but I'm out of space. DON'T BUY THIS GAME!","January 25, 2014","false","57.7"," 24 of 40 people (60%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","60","24","40","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UntoldAv3nGer/recommended/19900/","UntoldAv3nGer","UntoldAv3nGer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UntoldAv3nGer/","87 products in account","This game is one of the best games I have played. This game gets some negative feedback because of its difficulty, but I will explain why you should play it.\nFirst off, Far Cry 2 still looks absolutely gorgeous. Africa has never looked better in a game. You will find zebras and gazelles roaming the grasses. You will enjoy mountains, waterfalls, and canyons, travel across the small lakes, visit Pala, Sefapane, and Mosate Selao, and speed across the dirt roads to hunt for enemies.\nThe gunplay in Far Cry 2 is undoubtedly realistic. This is no Call of Duty; your guns behave like real ones and there is not much "running and gunning" unless you are playing on easy.  There is gun jamming and degradation, so you will need to take care of them. There are weapons for everyone. There are multiple rocket launchers, grenade launchers, pistols, machine pistols, snipers, and explosives. There is even a dart rifle and a explosive crossbow!\nThe missions are fun but may get boring. I would advise playing on Hardcore or Infamous difficulties because when you play on them, the game becomes much more challenging and even more realistic. There are respawning outposts with enemies, and these provide good fun since you never run out of people that are trying to kill you. Many people are not used to such a harsh game; expect everybody outside of the Ceasefire zones to try to kill you. Is that good? Your call.\nThere are tons of weapon upgrades and some vehicle upgrades, plus upgrades that will allow you to carry more ammunition or molotovs. The second half of the world unlocks when you complete half the missions in the game, and this second world adds new Jeeps, boats, and guns, plus new locations to explore.\nFire is my favorite part of the game because it is so well-done. The fire is better than Far Cry 3 because it was not designed to play a large role in Far Cry 3. Far Cry 2 has seasons and rain, so expect fire to work less effectively when the grass is green or there is a downpour. When the grass is dry and there is no rain, fire becomes the game changer. If I feel overwhelmed during gameplay, I may throw a molotov cocktail into some dry grass to start a (potentially massive) fire. This fire scatters enemies, forcing them to change their attack plan; if you are lucky, you may even get one to burn to death.\nThe audio in this game also never ceases to impress me. You can hear birds and monkeys in the trees, the wind rustling the leaves, the whine of the mounted gun as it swivels. When you are around enemies, you will hear their conversations (they sound believable). The music in this game is a nice change as it is what you would expect and African band to play.\nYou have malaria during the game, and it puts an interesting spin on your gameplay. You may have to wait out a malaria occurence, and this can kill you. The best tactic to do is throw a molotov and hurry to cover.\nNote that it took me 30 hours to complete my first playthrough. After that, you can do a new one on a harder difficulty (feel free to change difficulty anytime you want). The ending of the game is unexpectedly deep.\nAll in all, this is a game like no other. Everything I said above amount to an amazing experience. This is an experience like no other that can be had, during a sale, for just $2.50.\n\n","July 3, 2014","true","87.3"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","4"

Game looks really good. There is a lot of weapons that you can buy. You get diamonds as reward for completing mission. With this you can easy customize your weapons and cars. It is an awesome, great looking open world in Africa.\n\nSingle player: Single player is main reason to buy this game. As i said before, the game looks amazing. It have great environment - deserts, rivers, cities. Missions are great. You have a lot of animals - you drive your car and suddenly infront of you is zebra. Epic ! You can easy find sniper position and easy take down enemy outpost. Or, if you want different approach - find a vehicle, stop it 10m infront of outpost, take machine gun and kill them all.\nI had only one big problem with single player, and this one is: enemy outposts ! You capture one, you go other area and when you come back - there are again enemies. Later, when you have a lot of weapons this is not such a big problem - but at beggining you can have some troubles with lack of bullets.\n\nMultiplayer: Unfortonatly, MP in this game is DEAD.\n\n\n","March 21, 2014","true","4.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanburnsred/recommended/19900/","ryanburnsred","RyanBurnsRed","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ryanburnsred/","294 products in account","I'm just gonna go ahead and say that FC2 is my favorite game in the series. I found Far Cry 3 to be casualized and easy. There was no challenge from start to finish and it follows the same Ubisoft open world formula from recent Assassin's Creed games. Far Cry 2 is vastly different and I prefer it over Far Cry 3 and 3.1, I mean 4 for a number of reasons.\n\nI mean just the fact I don't have to climb any radio towers to see more of the map or having the map littered with collectable icons are great. The feel and sounds of the guns are also really good for a 2008 game. Every gun in FC2 feels unique and don't feel like a toy compared to FC3 and 4. Guns jam, they have recoil, they show signs of wear and tear, and more. They don't feel like brand new military weapons but rather feel like they fit the African milita setting of the game. Every gun in FC3 and 4 feel like they're brand new and the sound is muddy when shooting them. In my opinion the gunplay in FC2 is some of the best I've played in a first person shooter, and I play quite a few of them (check my Steam game list if you want).\n\nThe AI I think is pretty decent for a 2008 title. There are games released today that have far worse AI than this game. In Far Cry 3/4 if you're up on a cliff or a decent distance away and you take an enemy down via sniping then the others in the camp or nearby will always somehow zero in on your location. In FC2 the enemies will try to help their fellow comrades by carrying them to safety and search the immediate area, not instantly know which direction the shot came from like in FC3/4.\n\nAs for the malaria it never really inconvenienced me when out and about, and I thought it was a pretty nice touch to the overall setting. I also don't feel it artificially prolonged the game like say having a crap ton of collectables all over the map.\n\nAs for the story I'd have to sayit's not the best. In fact I enjoyed Far Cry 3's story more than FC2, but when it comes to the gameplay then FC2 for me wins easily.\n\nI give it an 8/10.\n\nPS. Don't mind the 2.6 hours on record. I played this game to death when it came out on PS3 and bought it on Steam a couple years ago on sale.\n","May 17","true","2.6"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

In the process you must cope with the locals who are  actually all foreigners too, but all the locals have left, so does that make the foreigners the locals? This is one of the mysteries the game gives you, the story keeps you guessing as you do work for two guys who hang out with foreigners all the time. Bill and Ted give you folders of diamonds instantly transferred to your International Diamond Account and order you to blow ♥♥♥♥ up, giving you the dough whether you actually go to complete the task or not.\n\nThey also warn that their men will also shoot you because it's that much of a black op, but aren't they all foreigners as well? Both the UFLL (United Females Lottery League) and APR (American Punk Rockers) mercenaries look the same, so how can they tell eachother apart?

The Government has been dismantled and there are now two factions trying to take control over it. Your goal is simple: kill the Jackal, an infamous drug dealer who benefits from the war selling guns to both factions.\nIn order to do so, you must shot your way to the Jackal. You can ally with both or just one faction which makes for a non-linear story; something really appreciated for those who value replay-ability.\nPowered by Dunia Engine, the visuals are really well done and you will find yourself on savannas and desserts within a effectively designed world. The engine does a good job improving the stealth aspect thanks to day/night cycles that actually varies the way the IA work as well as includying dynamic fire propagation on the grass along others.\n\nInmersive and awesome to explore	As the franchise got as accustomed, the world is filled with cars, trucks, hang gliders, boats and ATV's. Throughout the story, you will need to take pills that help you to control your malaria. Oh, yeah! You got malaria at the very beginning of the story. Failing to take said pills (which runs out really fast) will make you pass out and you will have to restart the mission again.\nThere is not a big selection of guns on this one though. I have to note also just how minimalistic and inmersive the interface on this game is. You don't check the map by a popup window in front of the actual gameplay but rather, your character holds an actual map wherever you need it and so on with a lot of elements on the game. Those are little details I love to find given they improve the impression that you are really there.\n\nIt definitely has its problems, though	I hope you like driving, because oh boy, you are going to drive a lot. Not that it gets incredibly tedious. During your driving you will find enemies along the way which helps keeping things interesting. However, you are still going to drive a lot.\nLikewise, to be considered a realistic game it's surprising how long it takes to kill enemies. Not everyday you see a regular person wearing nothing but a t-shirt get shot six times on the chest and still count the story, but enemies on Far Cry 2 sure can. Nevertheless, it works both ways considering you can walk to an enemy from a good distance while he is shooting directly at you and still kill him with a machete.\nThe story is great, with interesting dialogues and memorable quotes but I really could never put my heands on the multiplayer, something about Ubisoft's servers not responding when I tried to sing up. I have never heard of it being shut down but to be honest I haven't bothered to look up much on the subject. Multiplayer was just a feature in this game, singleplayer is where the fun part is at.\nPlaying this game on the Hardcore or Infamous difficulty mode makes it so much enjoyable, really. Because you can't get shot nearly as much as Normal you start making better strategies than just show up with your car in the middle of your enemy's base and start shooting everywhere like you were blind-folded.\n\nSo, should you buy it?	You're damn right you should. Far Cry 2 has to be one of the most enjoyable shooters I have ever played. An awesome game about exploring, surviving and killing so you can get a sweet, sweet revenge on everything the Jackal has put you and others through. Oh, and also, about driving. A hella lot of it. Let's also take a moment to appreciate the fact that this was (and probably will) be the last Far Cry without uPlay DRM. Anyway, despite all the flaws (which aren't that many, really) Far Cry 2 is well worthy of your money.","October 17, 2015","true","6.4"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The game succeeds in being immersive and captivating, and the actual gameplay is exciting and has some novel mechanics. Also, there is an interesting story aspect imbedded in the main campaign. These qualities can help some people overlook the minor annoyances; others however may feel like it’s not worth putting up with them, especially if they aren't as interested in the narrative and atmospheric aspects.\n\nI felt that the environments were well-designed and the gameworld was a pleasure to explore. The graphics are pretty solid, and the animations and effects are noticeably good.    Far Cry 2 definitely has a nice setting.  If you enjoy immersing yourself in foreign gameworlds, you should like this.\n\nThe gameplay is also pretty fun overall. There are a lot of good ideas and unique nuances in the game. Also, the combat can be exciting and the open-world allows you to plan your route of attack any way you would like.  There are some annoying aspects to the gameplay, though.  But there are some pretty awesome missions sprinkled throughout the game that make putting up with the annoying parts worth it.\n\nAs for those annoying parts, there are two main aspects of the gameplay that can become tedious at times. For one: the gun jamming. The idea of implementing mechanics where guns found on the ground have little ammo and jam frequently sounds interesting on paper, but it needs to be executed well. In Far Cry 2, there are times it winds up being far more annoying than interesting. And the other main gripe with the game is the extremely frequently respawning guard posts.  Clearing 5 guard posts every time you want to travel on the map gets old fast.\n\nBut both of these annoyances can be extensively minimized by just playing on easy.  Guns will jam far less often, and you will able to drive right through the guard posts instead of clearing them out every time. So I suggest you don’t play this particular game on a high difficulty.  You will only magnify the aforementioned faults with the game and allow them to overshadow the fun parts.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/recommended/19900/","ownosourus","ownosourus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ownosourus/","3349 products in account","What's best about Far Cry 2?The true answer is that there is no one thing that can be considered best about Far Cry 2. Its brilliance lies in the fact that it is more than the sum of its already impressive parts. Essentially the game is a playground that caters for whatever mood players find themselves in. Want to storm into an enemy encampment in broad daylight John Rambo style, perhaps running a few unfortunate soldiers down with a MG-mounted Jeep before letting loose with your grenade launcher? Go ahead. Prefer to fast-forward the incredible day/night cycle to midnight by taking a nap in one of the Safe Houses and sneak in under the cover of darkness before slicing and dicing from behind with your machete? Be the game's guest.Ubisoft Montreal isn't, of course, the first developer to do open world shooting.But it is so well executed, so technically proficient that I can't help but feel it at least matches and in some areas even surpasses other games of the genre.After choosing from a selection of nine refreshingly un-clichéd mercenaries, ranging from a 45-year-old Mauritian to a 38-year-old Algerian you're thrust into an unnamed African country being torn apart by two warring factions.Your mission: To kill The Jackal, an arms dealer who's fuelling both sides of the conflict with weapons, and making a mint as a result. You immediately run into problems - malaria wraps its diseased mitts around your innards, forcing you to collapse as soon as you arrive in town. You wake, groggily, and find The Jackal standing ominously above you. He knows everything - who you are, why you're here and how defenceless you've become as a result of the malaria. In pity, he hands you a machete and a hand gun, and lets you live. This is where Far Cry 2 kicks off.Outside, all hell breaks loose. The United Front for Liberation and Labour (UFLL) and the Alliance for Popular Resistance (APR) are going at it in the streets. You make a break for it, dodging bullets as you head anywhere as long as it's away from certain death. But there is no escape - either you're shot or you collapse from the malaria. You wake in a slaughter house just outside town. A merc, one that you did not pick to play as at the beginning of the game but is determined by that choice, now reckons you owe him a few favours on account of him saving your ♥♥♥. From there, it's up to you what jobs you take on, whether it be paid work from the UFLL or APR, malaria pill jobs from various good Samaritans, weapon vendor jobs that unlock new purchasable gear, buddy jobs that improve your 'history' with the NPC mercs or assassination jobs dished out by a disguised voice heard from communication masts. What they all have in common, however, is combat, and it's here that Far Cry 2 initially frustrates.I'm used to developers holding my hands so tightly during game tutorials, and even beyond, that Far Cry 2 will at first jar with many due to the fact that it's actually pretty tough right from the start. Simply shooting stuff is difficult. Unlike the console versions, the PC version doesn't have a snap to target function when you zoom down the barrel of your gun. This is fine - the PC keyboard and mouse set up allows for a degree of FPS accuracy console controllers simply can't. But this doesn't stop your weapons, especially at the beginning of the game, from being, frankly, crap.You'll find the recoil offensive, the jamming so regular you'll tear your hair out and the enemies so hard to spot in your splendid surroundings that it won't be long before you grab a mouthful of dirt. The healing system doesn't help. Whenever your health dips you can inject yourself with magic hit point juice. That's fine, but when your health bar is almost depleted healing will instead trigger an animation where you gruesomely pick bullets out of the holes in your skin. The problem is that this animation, which takes about five seconds to complete, is interruptible by enemy fire. Some will applaud Ubisoft Montreal's approach. Some will criticise it. Whatever your opinion, persevere. Soldier through the difficult opening few hours, keep earning diamonds, keep reducing the recoil and reliability of your weapons with upgrades, and above all, keep experimenting, because it's only through experimentation that you'll realise Far Cry 2's undoubted potential.The save system differs from the console versions in that you can save absolutely anywhere and whenever you want. There are no checkpoints in Far Cry 2, at least not in the traditional sense of the term. Instead, you'll get a pop-up asking you if you want to save after you complete mission objectives, when you use the coach transportation system or when you go to sleep using one of the Safe Houses. The many guarded checkpoints will annoy some, but for others they will reinforce the feeling that you're never safe. Because the map is so big, you'll spend a lot of your time driving around. If you're going to stick to the road, you're going to run into at least three checkpoints along the way. Every soldier manning the checkpoints has a shoot first, ask questions later policy, too, making driving more a case of survival than sight seeing. The enemies respawn, too, so you can never once and for all clear enemies from that check point on that road you keep using to get to and from town.Obviously if you're a shooter fan you should buy this game. A simple glance at the score should confirm in your mind, if there was ever any doubt, that Far Cry 2 is nothing but brilliant.","February 24, 2014","true","14.6"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","4","4","0","0"

It's not even when you stride through the ruins, calmly putting down survivors by plunging a machete into their chests.\n\nNo. Its appeal is in the moments beforehand - when, from some lofty perch, you think of what's to come. You check your ammo. You reload your weapons. You heal up. You anticipate. It is the calm before the storm. You are the match before the flame.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ergothetactless/recommended/19900/","ergothetactless","Ergo","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ergothetactless/","105 products in account","Far Cry 2 is one of the best shooters of all time. Like any good story, it's loosely inspired by Heart of Darkness. And believe you me, the story, barebones as it might seem (no traditional cutscene until the very very end), is shocking and incredible. Trust no one, shoot everything that moves, you will be friendlier with your ingame buddies than your real life ones, all that good vidyagamey stuff.\n\nFar Cry 2 avoids many of the flaws of its successor - a game I would best describe as Robinson Crusoe for somebody who wants a power trip. Not knocking its many successes (the animal system, etc), but many RPGs make the mistake of letting the player get away with pretty much anything in the lategame. Far Cry 2 is not an RPG. You will make decisions, but you're not in search of XP: you're in search of a better chance at survival, and if you're feeling lucky, maybe you'll try to keep your buddies alive too.\n\nFar Cry 2 is an experience.I chose to disable the crosshair because muh immersion (note the presence of ironsights makes that decision slightly less punishing compared to, say half-life) and I highly recommend you do the same as well, because this game, despite having questionable graphics from the mid-2000s, works best when you're immersed and twitchy and prepared mentally for the worst.\n\nFar Cry 2 gives you nothing. You have to earn every buddy, hoard every high quality weapon you own, build your reputation with the factions brick by brick. Regardless of your choice of APR or UFLL - pick your own lesser of two evils - your greatest enemy is the jungle itself. Your guns will jam and even break (usually when you need them most), the harsh terrain and many, many faction guard posts means that even a trip between two safehouses a mile apart must be planned and taken with the utmost caution, and don't even get me started on malaria. If you play Far Cry 2, prepare to be challenged.\n\nFar Cry 2 is a first person shooter that does not encourage combat. Even one soldier is a very valid threat of death. You do have a safety net in the form of your buddies, but don't rely on it. It's almost always better to detour around or sneak past a guard post than to plow through it. Stealth is encouraged but not rewarded - you can stealth kill, but guards will almost always scream out upon death, meaning that a kill threatens you more than helps you. Even carrying a sniper rifle at all times (highly recommended) and engaging from a great distance carries great risk, from multiple guards jumping in jeep and running and gunning you down, or mortar strikes, or a random patrol invalidating 90% of your hard work. Recommendation? Be ready to move, always keep your health high, and your life is worth more than anything else, even (especially?) the mission.\n\nFar Cry 2 will not leave you in the same place you began it. Many (most?) video games place you as the most important person in the world and give you all the tools to your success. This is not a power fantasy. This isn't even an underdog fantasy. This is hard work, and any reward will be in your head alone. You will be beaten down and beaten up, but if you beat the game, you will genuinely feel accomplishment and success unlike any game out there.","April 3","true","51.8"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/edinlex/recommended/19900/","edinlex","Rage Kage","http://steamcommunity.com/id/edinlex/","130 products in account","Let me start by saying that this open-world FPS isn't for everyone. I started playing this game years ago, and i finally finished it only a couple weeks ago. This is partly because of the massiveness of the game, and partly because of the repetitive nature of it. One review i read of this game said it's the game that "doesn't give you what you want, and slaps you for asking". This is very true, the game presents many obstacles (guns that deteriorate and jam, malaria that makes you have to take medicine at any given point in the game, lack of ammo & resources, etc.) and doesn't have a single auto save. Every save is manual. Every. One. Fast travel is hardly any faster than driving across the giant map, because you can only travel to and from one of 5 fast travel stations on the map. And let me tell you, vehicles in this game do NOT go fast.\n\nThis giant stew of inconveniences is what gives this game it's value. The setting is Africa, a wasteland containing only violence, disease, and scarcity. By making the player endure these frustrations, Far Cry 2 gives every convenience you recieve a kind of personal importance. The regular attacks from enemies beat you down until you become a proud killing machine. The slow and dangerous nature of transportation in this open world gives you a familiarity with the map, and maybe (what happened in my case) an unprecedented respect for the design. The story plays a passive role in this game (kill things, get payed, get closer to completing your main mission), but it fits into the violent & depressing theme. The ending, however, is fantastic.\n\nThis game is slow. The combat is relentless and routine. You have to struggle to complete each mission, and the characters are all shallow. By stripping away all the usual comforts you would expect to find, Far Cry 2 does something extraordinary. It puts you outside of your comfort zone. You're alone in this troublesome world, and you have to discover for yourself how to make it out alive.","January 27, 2015","true","46.3"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","1"

Go to my profile to check out some of my helpful reviews!\n\nFar Cry 2 is honestly the most realistic game I've ever played. Imagine Insurgency with missions and a good storyline. Mainly, all you have to do is start out fighting for one client, and from there you collect more, in which you get more missions, in which you get more resources.\n\nThe map is a greatly sized one compared to other games'. You have a map and a GPS to always use, that directs you to certain missions. Many of these are made to let the player use his/her own style, such as stealth, agressive, defence, or just plain old sniper from a long distance. The system of the stealth is mostly featuring missions like save the hostage, kill all the men without having a specific one notice, or taking/stealing a certain object smoothly. I, for example, on the hostage mission, enjoy going in, silent as possible, not being detected, killing some guards without the others noticing, and then saving the hostage. Then I shoot everthing.\n\nThe graphics are fantastic, as well as the multiplayer function, though my favorite is single player. The gameplay is tricky and fun at the same time, as well as the enemies (AI Units) are actually intelligent! This suprised me, when I tried to headshot one, missed, and they ran in different directions, to good cover, and one behind the hostage.\n\nAlso, the cars and planes are very well made. It is so realistic! No crosshairs in the game, no big texts on the top, but it just looks like you are looking from a first person view in real life. Another neat feature is the diamond GPS, where you can detect where hidden diamonds are and use them to trade for weaponry and other important goods that will need to be used to survive. My favorite part is that...\n","November 15, 2014","true","8.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Not too heavy on story more for the explorer, but not too much depth where you lose yourself in the side-elements of the game,  you get back on track pretty quickly and the missions are challenging but dying in firefights is pretty lame, until you gain a few comrades' who pick you up instead of having to re-do your assault missions.  This one doesn't take much from the first Far Cry except the high expectations in graphics and gunplay is more refined in this one.  The Feature of guns wearing after a bit really adds nothing to the game...cept tragedy in the middle of a fight.  There really isn't anything groundbreaking or gamebreaking in this one, a light frills ride through the Exotic African flatlands and forests' and the desterts...One of the best game in the series, has the longest play value, but yet is nothing that you haven't seen before in an open world.

The only reason i never finished it before is because I was annoyed with the malaria aspect but it turns out only to be a minor annoyance in the game. I finished Far Cry 3 before finishing Far Cry 2, although I started playing it years ago. I always knew I would come back to it and I am glad I finally did. I won't do any comparison to the original FarCry because that is entirely a different game, in my opinion.\n\nI found FC3 far too easy, being able to track your opponents, even through trees and rocks nerfed the difficulty enough, and getting special superpowers as you level up only made it worse.\n\nIn FC2, you have malaria, which is like, the opposite of a superpower and became a hazard if you started having an "attack" in the middle of battle. And also, you have weapon jams which happen randomly as your weapon wears down. A weapon jam might sound annoying but it is a little detail in the game that adds a little realism and extra challenge to the game which I can appreciate.\n\nYour "buddys" are randomly chosen from your character choices from the beginning of the game, each with their own look and dialog.  You also have the chance to get incapacitated instead of dying, getting revived by a buddy for a second chance to finish the fight. if you go down too soon after though, it is game over. When you are low on health and apply first aid, the animations go from wrapping up a wound on your arm to pulling a bullet out of your flesh with a knife and plyers.\n\nAnother way it differs from FC3 is your character is not the focus of the game story whatsoever. The story is really about the Jackal, the factions and Africa, and you are just someone who is in the right place at the wrong time. You do get to choose a character, which only effects how your hands and arms look in the game\n\nAll these little details make a very unique first person shooter experience, and I think really smart game devs can learn from playing this one\n\nIn the end, the only real problem I had with FC2 was not the malaria, but the fact that I couldnt use a custom loadout. Every weapon falled under primary, secondary or special and you could only carry one of each. Meaning I could not use a sniper rifle and an SMG at the same time as they were both considered primary weapons.\n\nThe good far outweighs the bad though, and if you are jaded with your regular FPS experience, give this one a try.\n\n-edit- 2 years after this review\n\nI'm convinced this was one of Ubisoft's last good games. Also, it doesnt require uplay.","March 17, 2014","true","50.2"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Kill the man that has been arming both sides.\n\nThe gameplay is simpley amazing. The gun-play is next level and the environment gives you a feeling that the country is in horrible conditions and help is a far cry away. The most complaints i hear about FC2 is the weapon jamming and outpost, but for me it makes it more real. The outposts makes you strategicaly move from point to point and the jamming can ruin a firefight for you. It all makes it more difficult to survive, and instead of holding your hand all the time the game lets you approch how you want to. There are a lot of unlockables, weapons and uppgrades to let you play how you want to. Either run-n-gun or ninja style, and it does this well. Lots of games offer this, But FC2 manages this in a terrific way. The only complain i have is that the missions are very similar, little variety. But the different playstyles is enough to keep things fresh.\n\nAll in all i would say this is one of the best games i have ever played. It is almost 8 years old, but is a though competitor for even the newest games.\n\nIm giving this 8/10 bacon strips.","June 2","true","24.3"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

This really is a huge improvement over the first Far Cry being the first FC game to have openworld it really has developed a lot of new features that the first Far Cry didn't have. FC2's multiplayer you can invite your friends to join you but watch your back as you never know who your true friends are and who might betray you! All the single player technical features are also present in multiplayer mode. In Far Cry 2 you have a chance to explore a war torn African state and you are forced to make deals with corrupt warlords on both sides of the conflict this game's story really keeps people entertained and makes them not want to stop playing it is just an amazing story. They have changed the gameplay features of Far Cry 2 so unlike the first FC game there will be a lot of things that are different about the game and with the Fortune's pack DLC you can get access to new vehicles and weapons that are not in the game unless you bought the Far Cry 2 Fortune's Edition. Overall I give this game a 10/10 it is just a fantastic game to have in your collection and I think this game is definitely worth the money.

(17 total)\n-The ending.\n\nNEGATIVES\n-Buddy missions are not really useful they are more tedious than fun. Maybe if they were able to make buddies set up and ambush and you lead them to an area, but was more like kill this one guy so another guy stays in this encampment so you can kill him there, but it would've been easier to do it the normal way.\n-Underground missions, only time I did them was when I needed pills and even considered to not even get the pills despite it was something I needed.\n-Drving, starts off alright then just gets really boring, and annoying.\n-Stealth, stealth is very difficult to actually do in the game, damn near impossible actually. Kill a guy inside a house his buddy saw you through the building.\n-Lack of ways to complete a mission, don't get me wrong blowing ♥♥♥♥ up is fun, but I would sometimes like to have a different approach to things like snipe them from a mountain completely invisble from them, there were only a handful of times in which I was able to do this.\n-The missions, most of them are go here kill/destroy this come back and repeat, pretty much the entire game, would've like to see more varity, pretty linear.\n-Dialogue, the dialogue was pretty bad, felt like I was listening to them talk on x2 speed, and sometimes it would glitch out saying get in here, but you would already be there/say nothing or when they would call on the phone and there's nothing.\n-Collecting diamonds is useless, you make more than enough from the main missions and then some.\n-The AI they could drive past you and then they would somehow see you and turn around as if they had eyes in the back of their heads.\n-Decisions in the game didn't matter, same result.\n-Guard posts, you could clear a post and go down the road and back all the enemies would've spawned back, very annoying wished they would've had a timer as to when they would respawn.\n\nAfter almost 2 years I finally got back to it and beat it, the ending was satisfying-to me at least-but a good chunck of the game felt like a chore to do, that's why I left it unbeaten originally. So if you were thinking about buying it and can look past the negatives go for it, it has its moments.\n\nOne of my funnier moments:\nShot a guy down, but was still alive and was trying to get back up, shot a propane tank, as was it was spinning around and flayling around it hit him right in the head and his body just flopped down, was pretty funny to see it happen.","March 19","false","22.1"," 15 of 27 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","15","27","3","0"

In contrast, the game is very brown and dark green without the sun rays. It can get pretty dull to look at sometimes, but maybe that's what they were going for.\n\nPLAYABILITY:\nSince the game is open world, it gives you freedom to tackle your objectives how you want. It also gives you more than one way to carry out your objective. The guns are all pretty nice and all of them work well, which lets you develop a favorite. The malaria isn't really a problem. I don't care what everyone else says, I never once had a problem with malaria. It gets repetitive having to travel sometimes though, and hunting for diamonds can get super boring, especially considering that they are currency in this game and you kind of need them.\n\nDELIVERY:\nMy playtime was the amount of time needed to 100% this game. That being said, it's large. However, 100%'ing this is very dull. The missions are mostly the same thing over and over; assassinate a target, collect a briefcase, etc. The strongest point of this game would be the buddies. I found myself growing attached to the buddies I got and it made the game much more enjoyable.\n\nSUMMARY:\nDon't spend all your time collecting those damn diamonds unless you REALLY want to 100% this. Take the main missions, the buddy missions, and carry out your goals however you want. Make your own choices and don't think too much. It's not a bad game by any means.\n\n","December 9, 2014","true","44.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The terrain is very accurate to what Africa is, with both desert and jungle filling the maps. Very good graphics. It's interesting how you can choose your character with the only affect is that you don't appear as an npc in the game.\n\nOne of the problems I had with the game is that the story stretches out too long so I end up forgeting what im supposed to be doing in the first place. Enemies can also appear out off nowhere and kill you, sending you back to the last save (which happens alot when your on the hardest difficulty). I'm also a bit disappointed that none of the animals tried to kill you, we're in Africa aren't we?\n\nThe main problems with the game is the fast travel system because the only fast travel you have is the five bus stops in each of the corners and centre. The more you quick save the harder it is to load the game manually. (Unless you delete them which I forgot to do). The AI is sometimes dumb and occasional fires through walls.\n\nI loved this game, but it is not for the inpatient. 8/10","September 23, 2014","true","48.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Didn't quite finish it, because the ending boss fight was a little too difficult. FC3 was the first I played of the series, and it was outstandingly fun. Yeah, it was a little too action-y, but man, did it have a good story and addicting gameplay.\n\nThen came FC2. WOW! Can't say enough about how good this game is.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stupac0110/recommended/19900/","stupac0110","stupac","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stupac0110/","676 products in account","Far Cry 2 heavily expands the appealing, basic formula established in Far Cry 1. I would call it the first modern Far Cry game since most of the hallmark Far Cry features come into their own in this title. The core of a Far Cry/Crysis game is fast paced, streamlined, semi-realistic, immersive first person military shooter in large open environments where the player is free to explore multiple approaches (stealth, close range assault, sniping, explosives, vehicles, turrets, or any combination thereof) to overcoming enemies.\n\nFar Cry 2 also introduces a large open-world, non-linear mission system with multiple factions, weapon and equipment unlocks, safe houses and buddy companion-system. The central african environments are breathtaking and the game takes great pains to immerse the player in the environment. The HUD is incredibly minimal with most actions and situations being context sensitive and told through actual interaction with the environment. For example, rather than healing being simply invisible (the health bar just refills), you'll see your character inject a syrette in his/her forearm, reset a broken limb, or pull a bullet from a gaping wound in their leg. The map just doesn't appear on the HUD, you actually pull a physical map and GPS out. When your character suffers the affects of malaria, you're vision will blur and turn green and you'll have to pull out a pill bottle and swallow a pill to counter-act the effects. All these things effectively serve to immerse the player in the world, but don't inhibit gameplay. The enemy AI is also very sophisticated and will communicate with one another, actively hunt for you and attempt to surround you (or where they think you are), or even get scared and take cover or run. My primary grievance is that random encounters when traveling can be a bit to frequent and bypassing frequent road blocks and guard posts can get to be a grinding chore in traveling around the map.\n\nThe mission system that unveils the story is fun and engrossing. The story is not just handed to you, but the player will have to really pay attention if they want to figure out what is really going on. The interplay of the factions, the player, and their buddies is fascinating and keeps the game fresh from start to finish. The side missions do get a bit redundant though, which include destroy arm shipments, and assassinations. Luckily, the core Far Cry gun play is solid and doesn't get old quickly. It is fun when a situation goes from you getting a jump on a bunch of enemies to reinforcements showing up and surrounding you as you run short on ammo and having to fight for your life to break the encirclement and make a run for it. Which brings me to the buddy system which is rich and unrivaled in any FPS/RPG that I have seen. The system is rather organic and you really seem to build a relationship and history with your buddies who are fellow mercenaries try to profit in this little civil war.\n\nAll in all, there are few games I can safely recommend as must plays for anyone, but this is definitely one of them.","February 17","true","28.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TGRaid/recommended/19900/","TGRaid","[TG]Raid","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TGRaid/","74 products in account","Far Cry 2: Buy it!\nI am less than 10 h/ into the game, but I can say that it is worth however much money you get it for. The AI for the enemy's can be a little shaky, but for the most part you can actually use their purposly implemented features to your advantage. Scenerio example:\n\nYou spot an enemy in the distance, in a base camp. Your mission objective is far away, yet you can't resist the urge to make your own fun in this barren wastland. You get a little closer, while still remaining in the bushes and shrubs, and you finaly get close enough to where you think you can make an accurate shot. You crouch down, take aim and fire at their shoulder. You hit, and the rest of the enemies remain clueless as to who fired the shot. They rush over to the wounded souldier, and as they get there you make a dash to get with close range, and take out 3 enemy's with your shotgun remaining unharmed and get behind cover before any other enemy's can get a shot off on you. 3 down, 2 more to get an easy advantage on using the same method with a little more run and gun.\n\nThe enemy's "caring" features as I would like to call them the feature I made a scenario about above. If you wound a souldier, or put one into a dangerous situation, if all goes well another souldier will move into the same general area, or go to the wounded souldier and help. This is a very cool feature that I like using, but you need to make sure that you are for enough away.\n\nThe different characters that you can play as all have a different initial spawning spot, which also means that your "boss" at the beggining has different traits (and of course different voice actors) which spices up the beggining of your game differently, which adds to replayability. Of course, I haven't played very far into the game on different characters so I can't confirm that the story/npc's that you meet later are different, but at least during the begining you can choose different characters to play as which gives different startings to the game.\n\nPermadeath. Do it. Seriously. Permadeath is where if you die in game, you can't respawn. Well of course you still can, but if you are following the rules then you delete your save/all other saves corosponding with that character you are playing with.\n\nThis game has a unique  buddy system , which can be fatal, and helpful. The more buddy's you have, the "safer" you will be. Your buddy's can save your A☻s, but sometimes can give you false hope, like if you only have one syrrette (morphine) left and you are at low health and your buddy is down, you can save them in the hopes that if you "die" that your buddy will rescue you, but your buddy is just as open to dangers as you are, and can die also.\n\nSyrrettes are morphine shots that restore your health to full, but you can only use them if you did the non syrrette heal, which is to hit the same key (H) and it will make your character do one of the dozens of healing animations, like biting a bullet out of your arm, using plyers to get a bullet out of your leg, pulling a peice of metal from your thigh, putting your arm back into it's socket, etc. which makes the game feel VERY realistic in the damage sence. Syrrettes are easily obtainable at safe houses, your "boss's" "house", enemy camps etc. but if you are constantly in the feild enjoying the open world aspect of the game, then you might run into trouble, esspecially if you are playing permadeath.\n\nSome notes:\n\n-If you steal an enemy car from a camp and another enemy sees you, they will engage.\n-ALWAYS use a vehicle that has a mounted turret. It's as easy as hitting "C" to switch to the turret and within second you have a weapon that can be way more powerfull than your weapons that you carry.\n-Make your own fun! Don't forget, this is an open world game. You can run around having fun and engaging in casual shennanigans alongside actually completing the game.\n\nAnyways, you guys should 100% buy this game!

First and foremost, their is an outstanding DX10 flaw that causes stuttering frames for some users (search for the workaround). As for the gameplay, Far Cry 2 does not feature a rich story in any sense and the enemy NPCs can become annoying with their over deadly accuracy and constant respawning. Still, Far Cry 2 is great for some freelance warfare especially given its detailed open-world environment.","February 27, 2011","true","70.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Equal parts brilliant and flawed, the game is wrought with frustrating game design but is thoroughly soaked in its sweaty, mosquito-infested atmosphere. Be sure to mod the game first to reduce some of the frustrations the game throws at you, Dylan's Far Cry 2 mod is good. Since most won't like the game, I'll discuss the good points first.\n\nFar Cry 2 drops your mercenary hide into an ongoing civil war between 2 factions in a war-torn African country, your objective is to hunt "the Jackal", the infamous arms dealer that arms both sides and thus, is fueling the war. The thing about the story is that it's actually not bad. The plot is heavily inspired by Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness, the resulting focus on barbarism and morality is clearly evident.\n\nThe game has an interesting approach to realism, the attention to detail is amazing. Your gun can jam in the middle of a firefight, performing the clearing drill around enemies creates a new level of tension. Fire is caused by anything flammable, molotovs, propane tanks, exploding cars, etc. And it propagates beautifully, better than in Far Cry 3 even. Your minimap is made of paper and you physically pull it out whenever you want to check it, it baffles me why no other game does this to improve immersion. Heck, even the plants bend when you step or drive over them, you can shoot the branches off trees too. A grenade will send pieces of a shed and the surrounding shrub flying, revealing the skeletal famework and anybody inside that is still alive. The AI is not perfect, they sometimes take turns to be impressively stupid and annoyingly sharp. But once combat starts, they yell updates at each other to coordinate flanks and comb the jungle for you when you are in hiding.\n\nAt first, you will flounder around the map, attracting the attention of every enemy you meet, a frustrating and demoralizing experience. Slowly, you understand the quirks of the stealth system, you unlock guns which compliment your playstyle, you discover the value of always moving in a firefight. You grow fearless and become feared. You learn how to shoot to wound instead of kill, so that you may silently watch their comrades run out of cover to rescue their buddy and take them both out. As your reputation grows, soldiers in the cease fire areas no longer arrogantly push you away when you run up to them, instead, they mutter fearful apologies and back off. Sometimes, in combat, they will panic and scream about how they just want to go home. As your character uses his machete to execute the wounded soldier on the ground, you realise that the game's mechanics have turned you into the monster you were supposed to kill.\n\nAlongside that, an ingenious game mechanic is the buddy system.\n\nThe game randomly assigns you buddies from a lengthy roster. Most of the time, you will be helping them run errands or get taken along by one of their crazy ideas to complicate the central mission. However, imagine this scenario: you attempt a raid and something goes wrong, a PMC flanked you from the tall grass to your right and you go down in bursts of shotgun fire. Your grow frustrated at the idea of restarting the attack, but then Josip, your hilarious, middle-aged Algerian buddy appears onscreen. He drags you to safety as you recall the time he got you to kill a car dealer for him because "Turns out car is piece of ♥♥♥♥ - so *he* is piece of ♥♥♥♥" and then awkwardly uses the word "cool" with a thumbs up and cheesy grin. You dig out the bullet from your forearm, the two of you re-enter the fray. However, assault truck pulls up. it's full of enemies and the machinegun on the vehicle sprays at both of you. You dive for cover and take it out with a grenade, only to see your buddy squirming on the ground. You move over to him and give him a morphine jab, expecting him to spring back to life just like before. But this time, he gurgles for more. With realization dawning, you give him another jab, his reply is the same. Now you have no more morphine and a dying buddy in pain. The game prompts you to unholster your pistol and you place it in his mouth. He even thanked you before you pulled the trigger. This is the way you get players to care.\n\nUnfortunately, those things only happen when the stars are aligned and the game plays as intended. The unfortunate reality is that in order for your emergent interactions with the militia to occur, the game throws them at you around every corner. This makes traversing the 50 square kilometers of the open world a serious hassle even when you master the art of finding paths of least resistance and take the bus whenever possible. Although it is highly satisfying to sneaking through a village to silence a high value target, it is just as likely that while sneaking through the town, the PMC on the platform at the other end of the town spots you with predator vision and blasts you with his RPG. Usually, stealth plans are thwarted midway because one missed shot from any silenced weapon alerts the whole camp to your position and they will almost instantly fire upon you from wherever they are. Using the machete is also, strangely, not a silenced kill. Making it useless expect in finishing off wounded enemies. I suppose Far Cry 3's magical teleporting knife instakills are an upgrade. The map design also causes fits whenever you encounter a steep cliff that blocks your safe shortcut to the objective. It makes you wish for helicopter travel or at least the ability to climb.\n\nAnother unfortunate thing is the mission variety, although you are free to tackle them they are confined to 3 types. Assassination/intimidation missions where you either kill or force people to do things and maybe kill them afterwards. Sabotage/retrieval missions where you destroy or steal objects which are in a village filled with PMCs. Last is the convoy ambush, which is exactly what it sounds like. The last type usually only applies to the arms vendor missions which you complete to unlock the possibility of buying new weapons. So for most of the game you will be contending with the first 2. There are only so many ways to skin a cat and nearing the end, missions have the same draggy expectation as a fetch quest. When combined with the frustratingly long and tedious travel, you can see why this game was a major disappointment for many.\n\nThe frustrations are slightly reduced with modding, Dylan's mod makes weapons much deadlier, increases the ammunition count, improves the effectiveness of your camouflaged suit, reduces the frequency of malaria attacks and jams as well as the chances of being chased when running through a checkpoint along with many other tweaks. As a result, you are more vulnerable and your gameplay will have even more tension. It's a good thing you have an extra life thanks to your buddy. I would advise to play it modded on the highest difficulty even on your first try because all is fair when you can usually down enemies with one round from any gun. Try to avoid conflict as much as possible and save very often, because you may die from ridiculous circumstances. That's all I have to say.","January 19, 2014","true","42.4"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It is the perfect game for when you want to have fun, but at a bit more relaxed pace than defeating a boss in another game. It is great fun to burn and blow stuff up and the story is pretty good also. At first, it is easy to get your butt kicked, but once you get some decent weapons it is fairly easy. I also LOVE the beautiful views and it's a way to get a dose of sun on a rainy day. The only real negative is the lack of wild animals like tigers, etc. but they fixed that in Far Cry 3. I still prefer this one though. Tip: try to grab a jeep with a grenade launcher because once you have that, you are almost immortal. The big assault truck is very effective also. And make use of the open space with a sniper rifle. I also found the dart gun to be very useful because you can kill like four guys before assaulting a checkpoint, greatly increasing your odds. The first one goes down and it lures other guards over. Muahaha!","February 28, 2014","true","735.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Take this scenario, you don't know that there is one specific part that links the south part of the map with the north (as if the north part wasn't big enough) you take your buggy over to the north part, expecting to be able to get there, but alas, your character passes out and you can't. it respawns you without a vehicle, and you have to spend the next 15 minutes walking to find a randomly spawning enemy car. It has happened to me, it's probably happened to you, and if it hasn't, consider yourself VERY lucky.\n\nI could go on, and I may seem to be very heavy on the cons, and not so heavy on the pros, but believe me when I say this, this game has it's moments, it's quite fun, i enjoy it, if it weren't for the MASSIVE amount of driving that you had to do, and respawning guard outposts, this would be the perfect game, and I think i speak for a lot of people, because far cry 3? It's basically what i just described, Ubisoft agrees with it, and the vast populi of people who have played the far series agree with it.","July 22, 2014","true","19.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

As of the time I am writing this, I have two hours. Most of my reviews haven't been helpful, and I really want this one to help people geniunely decide if this is a game they want to invest in or not. Let's start off with the basics.\nIntro So you start up the game, and click new game. There are 9 characters to choose from, each from different nationalities with different voices, buddies (which I will go into detail of later), and ages. All the characters are male, though.\nDifficulty Levels There are 4 difficulty levels. Easy, Normal, Hard, And Infamous.\n\nOn to the next thing..\n\nUnscripted Player-Driven Events! Unfortunately for modern gaming, this is something most new games lack. Far Cry 2 is great for this kind of thing.\n\nSomething I Found on IGN\n\nMarty dragged me out of the line of fire and into the bushes when a random group of guys jumped me on the road. Stupid. You never take the road. A gunner on the back of a truck mowed me down while I fell into my own misplaced Molotov flames. Marty hands me a pistol and opens fire. I find a couple grenades, knock the truck around, and finish the job. When it’s all done, I hear Marty screaming for help. I can’t see him.\n\nBy the time I find his blue smoke streaming out of the woods, he’s grunting incoherently. I kneel down, jab a regenerative needle into his stomach, and wait for him to head home. He doesn’t get up. He’s still wounded, so I put another needle in him. Nothing, but he slows down, and his eyes roll upward. One more needle. Marty’s head hits the ground, and he stops squirming.\n\nI overdosed my best friend.\n\nSomething that happened to me in game (Not IGN)\n\nWhen I was playing Far Cry 2, I was crouched behind a car. I fired off a few shots at a guy, and he was killed. I realised something; I was wounded! As my health was rapidly pouring away, I quickly healed myself, but while I was doing that, my car exploded and fell on me. Instant death.\n\n\n\nOn to gameplay and stuff!\n\nGameplay\nThe gameplay is quite hard. If you are a newcomer and download the RealMode mod and play on Infamous difficulty for the first run of the game? You will die. A lot. You might die even without the mod. This game is BLOODY HARD AS ****.  Pick up a enemy weapon? Well prepare for it to be unreliable as hell. Snipers explode in your arms without any notice, guns jam, deal less damage...\nRecoil is a whole different thing. With weapons you purchase at the gun shops, they will do more damage, accuracy, etc. They also have a permanent "good" condition. However, firearms you "borrow" from your dead enemies, are quite the opposite; With inferior range, accuracy, and damage.\n\nWrap Up & Conclusion\nThis game has its pros and cons..\n\nPROS\n- Amazing openworld experience\n- Great fun\n- Is pretty old and still looks amazing\n- Supports mods\n- Player driven events\nCONS\n- wtf is a con there is none buy this game\n\nAll in all...

I know many people dislike this game; "It is too hard", "there are no clear quest markers", "Its not obvious when enemies can see you". But this game has certain realisms which, for a rising storm/RO2 fan, makes it more appealing.\n\nCertain features in this game make it just that bit better than the alternatives out there:\n\n+Your gun jamming when you have used it too many times. (With a nice rust effect to warn you prior)\n\n+Enemies don't just drop money, meaning that sometimes it is better NOT to kill all the lifeforms in a 30 mile radius.\n\n+There is a certain variety in the vehicle selection which i really like (The big white 'Tank' is truly a beast!)\n\n+Guns overheating, knife bouncing off hard targets; small features like this, and more, make the game beleivable.\n\n+You look at REAL maps instead of just  pausing and going to the menue, meaning you can look on the drive!\n\n\nAll these features, at least for me, make this game probably the best in the trilogy, and i have played all excessivly (bar 4), and despite the malaria being a bit of a bummer, it is pleasant to have a character who isn't just super amazingly tough and perfect in every way.\n\nWould definitely reccomend buying, as long as you are more into 'realism' (as obviosly you can still soak up bullets like nobody else can).\n\n9.5/10","March 25, 2015","true","15.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The few fast travel locations don't really help much in avoiding excessive driving around. Had there been more fast travel locations and the uber aggressive enemies were toned down a bit (or if they at least didn't respawn so quickly), I would've been more willing to put up with the repetitive missions, since repetitve as they were, they were still fun to play.\n\nI can't say much about the story itself since I didn't see it through to the end, but it was serviceable at best during my time playing. Not sure if it gets more interesting eventually, but if it does it sure takes a while to get going.\n\nUltimately I decided to call it quits on the main story and side missions and decided to just muck around freely. It was a more liberating and fun experience, though the fun didn't last long since due to story reasons (the main character has malaria) you can't go around without checking your health periodically, which requires doing more repetitive missions and I couldn't be bothered with that anymore.\n\nNevertheless, as I said at first, for the first 10 hours or so the game is awesome and I don't regret buying it. If you have more patience to deal with repetitive gameplay and can tolerate some of the more annoying design quriks, you'll certainly have fun with this game.","December 24, 2013","true","17.6"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/recommended/19900/","kingsigy","KingSigy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kingsigy/","526 products in account","Modern shooters have become little more than corridor crawls. You enter a mission and are funneled through the map with almost no deviation available. As far as the possibility of "next-gen" world building goes, shooters are stuck in a rut. Interestingly enough, Ubisoft made a valiant effort to push the FPS genre forward back in 2008.\n\nFar Cry 2 is one of the most invigorating ideas for a shooter that I've ever played. It doesn't always succeed in it's ambition, but the sense of freedom and the massive size of the world lend themselves to some fantastic moments. Those moments are spread a bit thin, though.\n\nWhile the very first thing you do in the game has an objective, the next 16 hours are pretty much you exploring. There are light story elements driving some of your actions, but you would be forgiven for not knowing that a plotline even exists. Your starting goal is simply "Kill the Jackal" and that is about as far as the narrative goes.\n\nThis is the biggiest flaw with the game. There is no urgency in anything you are doing. You could easily spend years combing over every inch of the game world and never feel obligated or inclined to tackle any missions. While that is very intriguing as a launching point, it makes for a game that feels lackadaisical and pointless.\n\nWhen you do take up a mission, that is when the game starts to breathe. The fast travel spots are rarely convenient, so you are (almost always) forced to find your own path. The in-game map can help you from getting lost, but it doesn't point out any direction to you. You simply need to chart your own course.\n\nDuring your travel to the objective spot, you often run into bandits. This emergent style of gameplay leads to some fantastic shoot outs that have you scrambling for your life. These moments do happen a bit too often to stay truly enveloping, but barely dodging a missile and sniping guys across a chasm never cease to be quick fixes of joy.\n\nWhen you finish a mission, you simply are left with nothing. The currency system in this game is almost entirely worthless. Since your weapons can break down or jam at random intervals, it makes some sense to want to buy fresh ones that you can replenish. Seeing as how you run out of ammo fairly quick, there doesn't seem to be a need to buy those weapons; just grab them off the endless amounts of bodies you pile up.\n\nThere is also the threat of malaria consuming you, which can make for some tense shootouts where a question of your mortality comes into play. Honestly, though, apart from some flashy effects on the screen, the whole malaria side of the game seems like an excuse to extend the length. You have to undertake missions devoid of originality to get more medication and it just ends up feeling like wasted time.\n\nI find it hard to remain angry at this game. It took me several months to muster up the desire to even see the conclusion, but the moments of bliss I encountered cannot be understated. I can't think of any game on current generation systems that even comes close to capturing the amount of freedom you are given.\n\nDevelopers love to throw around the claim that their game will allow you to "go anywhere and see anything." Ubisoft is pretty much the only one that let you do this. Traveling through most of Far Cry 2, though, you begin to wonder if you really want to see every facet of the map.\n\nAll in all, I won't say the game is bad. I don't even think it's bad. While there are some crashes here and there, everything works as it should. Enemies are sometimes smart and I never fell through the gameworld. I just wished I could travel around faster. I would also have loved to have a sense that my actions were doing something.\n\nFor the average gamer, though....I would take a pass. A game like Far Cry 2 takes a lot of maturity to conquer. It's joys are not quick and easy to obtain. A lot of effort needs to happen on the player's part to make anything of this game. If you're willing to sit through some rough terrain, you'll eventually find the diamond in the rough that lies at the core of Far Cry 2.\n\n6/10","December 29, 2014","false","17.8"," 25 of 48 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","25","48","0","0"

One of the things I like most, though, is that days and nights are long. A day in the game takes 8 real world hours, which is better than in almost any game I know.

That is, I didn't see it through to the end at all, at least the indended end. What happened instead is that about halfway through, I accidentaly shot my sister-in-arms while she was bleeding into the dusty sub-Saharan soil, begging me for help. You see, when one of your "buddies" goes down in a firefight, a plume of blue smoke will direct you to their location. You then have the option to either heal them with a magic syrette, leave them to their fate or, it turns out, blow their brains out right there and then. That latter option is denoted with the prompt "Press 2 for handgun". Clear enough, you'd think. Except I had been under the impression that "handgun" in this context would mean hauling the buddy to their feet and dragging them to safety, while fending off remaining assailants with a sidearm in your free hand. Because that is precisely what the buddies themselves will do for you when you've eaten one too many helpings of cold lead. So when instead of lending a helping hand, I watched myself put a gun to my friend's head and pull the trigger, I was left agape. Literally agape. As in, my mouth was hanging open and I was staring at the screen, for a good minute or so. After that, I drove around aimlessly for an hour or so, picking random fights, absent-mindedly going through the motions to complete a side mission. After that, I hopped onto a boat, drove out to a rocky island in the middle of a lake, climbed to the highest point I could reach, dropped an IED at my own feet and blew myself to hell, And thus ended the short and miserable career of Andre the Haitian.

However, still very playable for an average gamer.\nControls - 4/5 Very General, there's nothing hard with the controls but nothing new really, your average shooter/rpg controls.\nStoryline - 2/5 I hated it. I think they did an original storyline, decided that a game this size needed a longer storyline and so did a lot of copy and pasting.\nAI - 2/5 Poor. Once you wipe out a outpost/road checkpoint, apparently, all the guys twin brothers arrive 5 seconds later and have set up defensive positions. Fed up of having to deal with 20 guys every 100m down a road.\n\nGood Point - If you're looking for a game which is easy to get into, plenty of fun weapons where you can burn and shoot some general guys, then you're looking at the right game.\n\nBad Point - If you're looking for something where you call fall in love with the characters and the gameplay. I think there are better shooters and better RPGs.\n\nRecommended.","April 7, 2014","true","0.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Descartes888/recommended/19900/","Descartes888","-=|CT|=-Descartes","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Descartes888/","318 products in account","I've gone back-and-forth about whether to give this game a thumbs-up or thumbs-down.  Ultimately, I decided to give it a thumbs-up because I *did* enjoy playing it.  However, in my opinion this is a game with some serious flaws.  I picked this up as part of the Far Cry franchise pack, so I don't regret buying it.\n\nPOSITIVES:\n\n- It's a hardcore open-world sandbox FPS.  If you're into that, you will almost certainly enjoy much of the game.  "Hardcore" here refers to variety of things.  For example, there is very limited fast-travel.  Expect to spend a lot of your time driving back and forth between the same places.  This game doesn't hold your hand or give a ♥♥♥♥ about you and your time.\n\n- Continuing the hardcore theme, you don't carry much ammo and your guns often jam, especially when you don't routinely replace them with brand new ones.  I enjoyed this part, but some might see it as a nuisance.\n\n- There is a very good variety of guns.\n\n- The graphics hold up quite well.\n\nNEGATIVES:\n\n- RESPAWNING ENEMIES.  This is by far the worst, IMHO.  When you clear an area of enemies, they will respawn as soon as the area is unloaded.  This creates some really awkward situations where your missions expect you to drive back-and-forth over the same area repeatedly, and you have to re-clear it (or painstakingly avoid it) each time.  It's entertaining for the first few times, but it gets really repetitive.  Early on, I died to these guys a lot.  Later, I was just trying to avoid boredom by finding creative ways to kill them.  I don't *mind* enemies respawning, but these ones are way too fast.\n\n- The AI is inconsistent.  Sometimes they spot you when you're hiding in the brush.  Other times , they miss you when you are in the open right in front of them.  I can partially forgive this, since it is an older game.\n\n- Gun damage is very inconsistent.  Five pistol shots to a bare chest at point-blank won't kill.  But a sniper rifle is always a one-shot kill.  I would be more forgiving of this from a normal FPS, but FC2 is obviously a game that takes itself seriously and I feel like this detracts from the "hardcore" feeling for me.\n\n- The two sides in the civil war are completely interchangeable.  This is at least partially intentional, since the game is creating a bleak, mercenary-driven civil war where everyone is bad.  However, the player hardly ever sees the two factions fighting, and both sides seem to always want to kill the main character on sight.  While it's partly justifiable, it also seems a bit lazy to me.  I feel like the game loses it's appeal a lot faster because of this.\n\n- The main plot feels somewhat railroaded.  For example, you *must* work for both sides of the ongoing civil war to advance the plot (i.e. one side just stops giving you missions and you need to start going to the other side).  The ending was completely railroaded, as well.  Some have argued that this is because the player doesn't have complete control over the main character.  This is supported somewhat by the journal entries he writes during the game.  However, it strikes me as a bit lazy.\n\n\nBottom Line: My enjoyment of this game was like a bell curve.  Early on, I was very frustrated by some of the questionable mechanics.  By the middle of the game, I had adapted, gotten a good loadout, and was having a pretty good time.  But by the end of the game, the repetitiveness and plot-railroading got to me and I just wanted it to end.  There's a really good game somewhere in there, though.\n\nIf it sounds appealing to you, get it while on sale or as part of the franchise pack.\n\n","January 30, 2015","true","21.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Malaria gives you a sense of mortality that a lot of games tend to shy away from, and weapon malfunction is a great way to force improvisation. Even the high rate of enemy respawn has appeal; it's taught me to plan every mission in advance, and enemies that keep coming are the only ones that force you to keep yourself on your toes at all times. The UFLL and APR can call in as many foreign mercenaries as they want to; I'll keep cutting them down.\n\nI honestly don't understand why some people complain about these things.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/samhouston/recommended/19900/","samhouston","Sam Houston","http://steamcommunity.com/id/samhouston/","224 products in account","This rivals STALKER as my favorite game of all time. As far as immersion goes, FC2 is unsurpassed. The game feels exactly like my real life experience in overthrowing an unstable African nation. It's hard, especially on the higher difficulty levels. YOu have to think about how to approach each mission, which works well because you have a variety of options. While most of the missions can feel repetitive after a while, it's fine because the actual combat is intense. You can never let yourself be distracted or opting for the mindless approach, as each (infuriatingly respawning) checkpoint can kill you, no matter how many similar checkpoints you've cleared. Even the respawning checkpoints work out to a greater point, nothing you do is improving the country, no matter how many nameless enemies you kill. It's not perfect, as I mentioned many of the missions are repetitive, but the gameplay feels as intense and dark as the narrative, and every aspect of the game seems to blend together into a cohesive whole.\n\nGunplay is absolutely amazing, with each shot deadly for both you and the enemy. Flare guns in particular deserve a special mention, as the fire physics are devastating in this game. Apparently during early stages of testing, the fires would rage out of control, spreading across the entire map and killing every single character. The developers restricted fire to spread to a perfect circle, but to be completely honest I never noticed that as I usually used fire as a temporary distraction to flush enemies out of cover or to cover my escape.\n\nIt can be frustrating to escape enemies in vehicles, as they'll chase you to hell and beyond, but now I'm just nitpicking. Nothing in the game breaks the immersion or flow, the map is an item you can pull out and look at while driving, and the entirety of the game reinforces the brutality of the setting and the fact that you're not a golden hero, magically fixing everything for the natives. Even the ending goes for the same, I won't spoil it but suffice to say, The Jackal (FC2's antagonist) is probably my favorite character in video game history.","March 14, 2015","true","60.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's something...nomadic about how you play the game. It might not have the most stunning visuals or the most interesting locale, but it's the means in which you can dispose of your targets that make this a keeper. Had Ubisoft made the game more interesting, less frustrating, and even more immersive then I think it would have been a sheer blast to play.

(Really, the psycho-male antagonist is getting old)\n\n2nd reason: Its Not Afflicted By Action Movie Animal Predators!\nBasically, youll notice in fc3 and fc4 (the same game just reskinned) that the friendly npc's and otherwise are completely negated by poorly scripted animal interactions. A badger has the same effect on the environment as a mountain lion. Its silly, it feels lazy, and it doesnt instill any confidence in the civilian/paramilitary AI.\n\n3rd reason: ITS NOT JUNGLE\n\n4th reason: The poorly received weapon damage system. Im sorry but if youve asked for an open world first person shooter to provide you with a proper sense of realism you will invariably have weapon decay. (Thats a given) It also adds a very interesting dynamic to the world; you are always conscientious to your gear and effectiveness.\n\n5th reason: Malaria; I know, its one of the most hated aspects of the game mechanic. It also makes the game more interesting because you really do reach a state of panic at times looking for your medication. You really do feel more a part of the world because you are consistently affected by it and in a way that you cant always control (just the same in reality.)\n\n6th reason: Its not copy and paste like the latter titles. Its doesnt force you to unlock the map in the generic ubisoft way (Assassin's Creed) and finally........ NO UPLAY!!!!  OMG NO UPLAY!!!!!\n\nSo there ya go, if you can get over the ai (or man up and mod the ai a bit with the realism mod) and if you can look past the more repetitive missions (your an idiot if you think the other titles arent repetitive) then youve got an underrated gem on your hands.\n\nThanks for reading!\nNO UPLAY WOOOOOOOOOOO!\nPuma~","March 24","true","18.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I really enjoyed the open world, and it has some great rewards for exploring.  Combat is excellent, giving the player a wide range of choices in how to approach a fight.\n\nWith that said, I do have a few critiques of the game that I'd like to share:\n1.  Reputation:  This feature did not seem to help the player in any way.  I thought, when I saw my reputation going up, it might have an effect like giving me some leverage with the various militant groups.  Perhaps if my reputation is high enough, I would not need o fight my way through every checkpoint on the road, but no.\n\n2. Checkpoints: Throughout the maps, different militant groups have set up checkpoints which the player must either avoid or take on in combat in order to get where they are going.  I didn't mind it at first, but it became kind of tedious.  It would have made sense in the game to allow the player to pass at least some of these checkpoints unscathed, considering that you are working with those same groups on your quests.\n\n3.  Limited ammo:  Some of the more powerful guns understandable had limits on how much ammo could be carried.  However, it seemed a bit too severe.  Six darts?  Really?\n\n4. Strange weapons system:  Having a warehouse with unlimited weapons and ammo was an interesting approach.  However, it basically made the whole weapon condition feature pointless.  If you are going to add weapon condition, and have weapons break down on the player, then it would make more sense to have the player repair those weapons, rather than giving him access to unlimited quantities of weapons in perfect condition.  It's like they had an idea, then they just gave up on it.\n\nTo go a step further, let me explain.  I like the weapons in the game.  I like the weapons in a lot of games in fact, and I grow kind of attached to them.  If I find a cool gun, I want to keep it and take care of it, and make it my gun, right?  At first I liked the fact that a gun might stop working, and I might need to pick up another one, but once I found my warehouse full of unlimited guns ... it all seemed pointless.\n\n5. No Mutant Monkeys:  C'mon.  Where the heck are the mutant monkeys?  For nearly all of this game I was anticipating the encounter with mutant monkeys.  When I discovered the second map area, I became convinced that I would discover the lair of the mutant monkeys.  However, the mutant monkeys never came.\n\nSeriously, the more I think about it, the more I resent the failure of the developer to add a simple underground lab filled with mutant monkeys.  I mean, how hard can it be?  And who wouldn't want mutant monkeys in their game, am I right?  It's a win, win.\n\n","March 2","true","57.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

There's something...nomadic about how you play the game. It might not have the most stunning visuals or the most interesting locale, but it's the means in which you can dispose of your targets that make this a keeper. Had Ubisoft made the game more interesting, less frustrating, and even more immersive then I think it would have been a sheer blast to play.

Malaria gives you a sense of mortality that a lot of games tend to shy away from, and weapon malfunction is a great way to force improvisation. Even the high rate of enemy respawn has appeal; it's taught me to plan every mission in advance, and enemies that keep coming are the only ones that force you to keep yourself on your toes at all times. The UFLL and APR can call in as many foreign mercenaries as they want to; I'll keep cutting them down.\n\nI honestly don't understand why some people complain about these things.

Bullets can shoot holes in windshields, etc.\nI personally haven't had any crashes or bugs so far.\nThe open world is large and isn't too cluttered or too sparse.\n\n\nCons:\nPathing is a bit clunky. Don't expect to squeeze between tight spaces in gunfights or bunny hop up cliffs like in Skyrim.\nPunkbuster hung up while isntalling from Steam and would never finish. If you don't plan on playing online you can go to your steam install folder and find the install and delete it so it never installs.\nAlt-Tabbing resizes both the game and other windows.

Why did they call it Far Cry 2? I don't know. The only similarities between the two titles involve the driving mechanics and the shooting mechanics. Otherwise, they have nothing in common.\n\nHowever, in my opinion, Far Cry 2 is the better game. While Far Cry had a more involving story, Far Cry 2 had a more interesting setting. The open world, fictional, war torn, central African country that your mercenary character arrives in is immersive and glorious. From savanahs, to jungles, to deserts and sand dunes, to valleys, Ubisoft Montreal packed everything you might find in a central African country into this 16 square mile playground. The towns are small and sparse, but the wildlife you find in between will capture your bewilderment. This, simply put, is a fully realized environment. And it's absolutely stunning.\n\nOn the story side of things, the only thing I have to say about it is that it could have been more inspired. Basically, you choose a mercenary at the beginning of the game, and you play as that mercenary. The rest of the mercs on this list end up being your "buddies". Anyway, the story of the game is that you, an assassin for hire, was sent to this fictional country to kill "The Jackal", an internation arms dealer who is supplying both factions that are fighting for power. Well, as soon as you get too this country, your malaria kicks in and "The Jackal" ends up saving you. "The Jackal" is, hands down, the most interesting character in the game. His philosophy about the current state of the country and his knowledge of politics invoke that he has no personal interest in whoever wins, but he is moralistic in that he does care about the civilians. After he leaves you for dead with a gun and machete, you escape and are saved by one of the faction generals who will task you with saving your first buddy. This is where the game gets repetitive, at least it seems to.\n\nEventually, you'll save every buddy traversing through each area, doing missions for both faction leaders, doing missions for gun runners, doing missions for a mysterious contracter (assassinations). And, without going into details, these missions aren't that interesting. The only interesting moments honestly involve the few cutscenes you have with "The Jackal". But that doesn't mean the story is bad. It's just fleshed out with mercenary work as you are, after all, an assassin for hire. Eventually, you'll travel south to another part of the country where the remainder of the game takes place and more of the same is done. You find more buddies, you do more missions for the APR and the UFLL, and the, endgame.\n\nIn terms of gameplay, this game is amazing. The hyper realism (except for car repairs which are the opposite of realistic) is splendid. Your gun will wear down and jam, you have to perform quick self surgeries if near death, branches and shrubs sway out of the way, the HUD is completely off when driving or running around, you have to take malaria pills to fight the malaria. The other interesting aspect is the use of diamonds as a form of currency. This is certainly much in line with how some African countries are due to a lack of a formal government.\n\nTo summarize, brilliant FPS despite the weak story. And it's not even a weak story, it's just that the story was so sparse. The Jackal is such a great character, though, that he ends up saving the story.\n\n9.3/10","October 8, 2015","true","36.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alison/recommended/19900/","alison","alison","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alison/","147 products in account","This game is my favorite single-player first-person shooter of all time. I enjoyed Doom back in the 90s, but other than that i am not really a fan of the genre. I find the mechanics somewhat repetitive - you are forced to kill everything, everywhere, spraying bullets around like you're in some kind of direct-to-video action flick. Even acclaimed shooters like Half-Life and Bioshock come across as cartoonish and tedious to me. Counter-Strike changed everything. A game where you only get a rifle and a sidearm, where every shot matters, where a bullet to the head means instant death and spending the next few minutes learning from people far more skilled than you. After playing Counter-Strike, every first-person shooter felt like a mindless kill-fest where stealth or tactics did not matter. The good news is those things do matter in Far Cry 2.\n\nYou are still pretty much railroaded into killing everything that moves. It is an FPS, after all. But stealth always feels like a possibility. The tension before the killing ensues, the time you spend crouching motionless in elephant grass, is a highlight of the game.\n\nThe enemies in Far Cry 2 are some of the most human i have encountered. It's why killing them takes a toll - they are a lot like you. If you have been seen - if any of your enemies spot you - the whole base goes on alert. Forever. They will lay down suppressive fire in your last known position. They will wall-bang. They will establish search parties. They will freak out and start getting paranoid over the slightest noise. If you are seen - or heard - again, expect to die. One or two shots from an enemy rifle will wipe you out. But stay perfectly still, crouched in the undergrowth, and the enemy may creep past just a few meters away. And, as they widen their net, you may be able to slip through and circle round. Inevitably, ♥♥♥♥ will go south. You are spotted and clipped, then running through the jungle, sliding to obscure their line of sight, spinning round to lob a grenade or to spray and pray. Mostly, you will die. It is ♥♥♥♥ing brutal.\n\nI know some reviewers have complained about the mechanics of this game. Respawning bases. Deteriorating weapons. Malaria. I will admit i played with Dylan's realism mod and never tried it any different, but in Dylan's mod it all makes sense. You are sick and scared and stumble into the jungle with a pea shooter. So you see an AK, grab it, but it jams in no seconds flat. You see an unguarded jeep, jump in, then get hit by an RPG half a click down the road. The game teaches you these hard lessons in the first half hour. How are you supposed to survive in Ubisoft's nightmare version of Africa? Don't pick up jury-rigged weapons. Don't jack jeeps. Wait till dusk, get your belly in the mud and proceed to your destination at a crawl. Avoid the roads, avoid the checkpoints, scout your targets and look for a headshot. Value reliability over firepower. Value cover over speed. Value your life.\n\nThe story is grim. You play an opportunistic soldier of fortune in the midst of a civil war. Almost everyone is evil and corrupt, and the vast majority attack you on sight. Even if you try to minimize casualties on an assassination or sabotage mission, something will invariably ♥♥♥♥ up and the bodycount will rise. Or your next mission will require you to clean out a whole area anyway. Every time you hear a squeak you expect a technical to pull up and unload 50 cal into your back. Every time the sun falls on a certain pattern of leaves your trigger finger will twitch. And gosh, those hanging vines really do look like bodies sometimes, don't they? I loved Spec Ops: The Line for its simulated PTSD effects, but those were mostly scripted. Far Cry 2 plays it totally straight and your brain still goes there. ♥♥♥♥ is ♥♥♥♥ed up, man.\n\nSo yeah. The game is punishing. It's bleak. You spend most of your time holding your breath and crouched in the dirt. Every now and then you are awed by a herd of zebra crossing the savannah at sunset, or the majesty of a tropical storm, or the slow rising moon. And then a bullet ricochets off a nearby cliff face and everything turns to ♥♥♥♥ again. A lot of games have made an impact on me due to their strong narratives. Far Cry 2 is different. The plot is thin as a potato chip, but its unforgiving sandbox houses an atmosphere thick enough to haunt me offline. Best single-player FPS since Doom? For me, yes. Hands down.\n","June 5","true","37.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

On the one hand, it's a really good pick-up-&-play with a great weapon load-out, decent application of the sandbox model & an interesting premise. On the other hand, the AI seems to have xray vision, you can't really pick a side & the game feels a bit incomplete on some of the details.\n\nThe premise is simple; you are a mercenary sent to a war-torn African country with the simple task of killing an arms-dealer who is selling to both sides & prolonging the conflict. At the time you arrive, there is a shakey peace, but you contract Malaria & fall ill in the local town. You are found by the arms-dealer, named the Jackal, who decides not to execute you, presumably expecting you die a rather miserable & painful death on your own.\n\nYou awake some time later with the ceasefire broken & that's where you start; escape the town & get put to work by a member of one of the two factions. The problem is, the game starts to break down even here as you can't choose one side or the other, or neither. On top of that, everyone shoots at you, no matter who you're working for. The excuse is none of the soldiers know which side you're on so shoot first & just forget to ask questions. In reality, the programming for random friend/foe AI was too hard, too expensive or would've taken too long. Or all three. Either way, it can really annoy. The other thing that really annoys me is the fact the AI seems to be able to perfectly spot you in dense jungle, even if you are stood still & behind bushes & trees. The fact you can't see them thanks to the same foliage makes it even more of a fight weighed against you on purpose. These flaws feel like the design team ran out of time to put these mecahnics in, but for me, the making or breaking of a game is the details that really pull you in, & Far Cry 2 feels like is misses that trick.\n\nThe game does have some upsides; the weapon load-out is well thought out both in what you can carry & what guns you have access too. There are plenty of weapons for stealth & a night attack where no-one hears or sees you until you kill them is very satisfying. The 1-man army load out will also work great if you're careful with timing & smashing a heavily defended check point without taking any hits is good fun. Vehicles handle ok & there is enough variety in the missions, even if it does usually end up requiring you to simply shoot everything. There is a 'buddy' system, where you can befriend other mercenary characters who assist you or give you missions, even rescue you when you're health runs out. The graphics make it a very pretty game & some of the effects are excellent. My favotire thing are the tape reordings of interviews with the Jackal, some are rather disturbing in how cold the guy is, the little details that help you invest in the world.\n\nThe story is basically two parts. In the first, you do missions for the two sides in no particular order, plus a 'resistance' group smuggling civilians out, you're then asked to kill one of the leaders. In the second part, the exact same thing happens again. Needlessly. It does make the world massive, with a huge area to explore, but it feels a little thrown together.\n\nFar Cry 2 is so nearly there; allow you to work for one side or another, allow that to effect how you're seen by each side, make some checkpoints on the roads friend, some foe, some abandonned & make one half of the story cover the whole game & it's potentially a fabulous game.\n\nIt sounds like I don't like Far Cry 2, but in actual fact, I do. As a pick-up-&-play, for no more than a few hours, it's great. There's little thought required other than how you want to go about your mission & what weapon load-out to go with, it's a lovely game to spend time in visually, the number of guns you can pick from is wonderfully varied & there are loads of missions to keep you busy. But it's no more than that. If you can accept Far Cry 2 for those flaws, then you'll probably enjoy it as a kind of 'library title'; a game to play between the games you get heavily invested into. Because I am able to see & accept Far Cry 2 for what it is, I feel I CAN recommend it, but with the previso to not expect any real depth from it.","October 12, 2014","true","102.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/integraldude/recommended/19900/","integraldude","Integral dude","http://steamcommunity.com/id/integraldude/","171 products in account","This is not as good as farcry 3, but it still is better, kind of, eh...\n\nWant to travel to Africa and experience a gritty story with no heroes, tuly immersive gameplay, and beautiful vistas? This game nailed that, perhaps too well. Because the realistic approach in this game made you feel like a hard working ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, not a happy super hero with no regrets as in Farcry 3.\nThis game is probably one of the most dynamic and realistic game I have ever tried. There is no handholding and It is incredibly immersive, and difficult. Yet, I have not finished it, and I don't know if I have the time and effort to do so. Because this game is serious work. This is a game to come back to and play over time.\n\nWhat is good?\nNo UPLAY\n\nIt looks fantastic, it really does. And runs well without the most amazing graphics-card. In some ways I think it looks better than farcry 3, because is feels more real. There are really beautiful vistas in this game that makes you stop and just look around for a while, over and over.\n\nIt is very immersive. You are "always" in the game. No menus to constantly interrupt you as in farcry 3. The map is held in your hand for example. I really enjoy this interface-idea, way better than farcry 3. You are no super hero that can take on everybody and thousands of bullets. You have to plan ahead and you have to be smart. You are vulnerable and everything can go wrong. You guns suddenly might jam, the fire you (accidentally) started might burn you alive if you are not careful. Perhaps your car suddenly needs repair?\n\nAI is smart and will flank you, hide, and attack you even when wounded and lying down. Foliage is beautiful and will move and react to your running and shooting.\n\nYou do have some help (well, time will tell). You have friends who offer you help, and can even revive you if you get shot down. How you interact with these friends are totally up to you, and creates varied gameplay and events. You can work for arms dealers and upgrade your weapons and gears. You can find vehicles with mounted guns and a lot of firepower.\n\nThe game has few and short cutscenes that don't constantly interrupt and tell you what to do all the time. It is up to you, and if you have your wits about you, you can do it. It feels less like a game this way. Farcry 3 is a "Disney roller coaster entertainmnet island". Farcry 2 is serious work where you feel and smell the dirt, the burned oil and grass, the dust and the misery of the place.\n\nThere is wildlife, but no all over the place. They hide like real animals do. And you don't have to mass slaughter every animal to get a belt, in fact not at all.\n\nGuns behave realistically; whatch that recoil, you can't snipe with a handgun from 200 metres away. And the weapons break. I know many hate all these problems with the guns. But for me it makes the game tense, and you always have to be on your toes, comming up with a quick alternative if something goes wrong. - You cannot always rely on your super weapon.\n\nWhat is bad?\nWell, all these great things, are also the problem. As said before, the game is hard, sometimes too hard, and I found that I enjoyed shorter times with the game, rather than sitting for hours playing it. Every time I came back to the game, I marveled at the greatness of the game, and everytime I finished a session I was a little tired of it. It can be quite repetitive. Traveling around the map takes time and you constantly have to deal with angry people shooting at you, every time you pass a guardzone, even if you took the place out a moment ago - yes the guards respawn. Missions are not very varied either. If you compare to Farcry 3, there is not much to the game in terms of activities. The AI is tough, and sometimes it feels like they never give up. And they see you from far away with fantastic accuracy. It is not easy to sneak.\n\nConclusion:\nIf you play this game like farcry 3, you will be disappointed. The game does not constantly feed you content, and happy colors. Far cry 3 is truly fantastic in its own way and improved many flaws that far cry 2 had, but far cry 2 feels so much more dynamic. The game creates content for you by interacting with the world, not by feeding constantly what to do, say and think. It the dynamic moments that are special, where anything can happen, and how you react to it. The world is more realistic and beautiful than farcry 3. In a way it feels more like roleplay, because the protagonist is silent, and the game really shines when you put effort into it, and you get immersed. But that is also the problem, do you have time to get that involved without being entertained all the time by the game?\n\nI wish Farcry 3 (and 4) would be more a mix of far cry 2 and 3. Where you are more free to do what you want, and you are not constantly spoonfed every minute, and less collecting stuff and upgrading this and that. It felt like filler in farcry 3 that stopped you from getting on with the game. Far cry 3 is a better game. But Far cry 2 is unique, special and amazing, and it has created a deeper effect on me than far cry 3.","March 12, 2015","true","15.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","2"

The story is fine but it's very linear style gets boring after a few hours and feels more like a call of duty campagin for example get the mission/ kill the guys and repeat. Athough its an open world game some points of the map makes you feel enclosed and forces you to stay near the roads. After 3 hours i got really board of driving everywhere, the game really discourages exploration in my opinion, the outpost can be scouted but the enemies never go away and that get annoying when you just wana get to your destination. the map lacks a lot of interative feature with very few side mission, unlockables, collectables, crafting, etc. in my 20 hours first play through i did very few side mission and barely explored after 3 hours. i will be generous since you can get this game for very cheap but i would not pay a full 60 for something that  in todays market the feels unfinshed.\nFar cry 3 basically used the same formula but makes an terrific campaign and a immersive world with many things to distract you from doing the main story .\n\nfinal verdict 7/10","November 20, 2015","true","20.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/s-team-community/recommended/19900/","s-team-community","flikk","http://steamcommunity.com/id/s-team-community/","84 products in account","As far as I'm concerned, Far Cry 2 deserves to be remembered alongside the venerated classics of the genre; Half-Life, Deus Ex, Bioshock, and all those other semi-legendary shooters. But at the same time, it's not entirely surprising that it isn't remembered that way.\n\nTo use a really crappy pun, Far Cry 2 is, in many ways, a rough diamond. It might not shine, but it's just as solid and precious as any other of its kind.\n\nLet's start with the good, and the first good thing right off the bat about the game is the setting and atmosphere. How many other shooters take place in sub-Saharan Africa? It's a brilliant premise that's rarely explored in the genre. A war-torn, hostile, exotic setting populated by power-hungry warlords and psychotic mercs? There aren't many other real-world scenarios that would work better as an environment in which to set a shooter of this style, and I find it much more memorable than the exaggerated, tropical setting of Far Cry 3. By Far Cry 4 I was entirely disinterested in the franchise, and never played that game or any later ones. So I can't say anything about them. Far Cry 2's fictional setting is very believable, and the originality and thought put into it is apparent from the get-go.\n\nTo go along with the great atmosphere are some genuinely impressive visuals, which might sound weird to those who have only briefly played the game. The vanilla color palette is just plain awful, but the effects, textures, models and shaders are all top-notch for a 2008 title, and the Dunia engine has a few nice tricks up its sleeve. A little tweaking with the Sweetfx shader suite goes a long way towards rectifying the brown, muddy colors and is absolutely essential to getting the most out of the graphics and the overall experience, and with the right tweaks the game has massive visual appeal to this day, even compared to some contemporaries like Crysis that are more well-known for their visuals. The graphics are stylized yet realistic without ever really feeling uncanny or too outdated. Again-aside from the questionable color palette-the care put into the visuals is apparent right from the start.\n\nAll this would just be academic if not for gameplay to truly make the game worthwhile, and FC2 surely delivers in that regard as well.\n\nI've always considered Far Cry 2 to be a minimalist shooter, which might sound bizarre when you consider the massive, open world and whatnot. But at its core, there are only a few core elements driving the gameplay here. No shoehorned RPG elements, no crafting, very little NPC interaction, no player-influenced dialogue, not even much of a story. This minimalist, almost barebones approach to gameplay? Well, quite frankly, it's just plain fantastic. One thing I really disliked about Far Cry 3 was the degree of artificial progression in it. By which I mean the skill trees and crafting- this doesn't add flavor to the game as everyone ends up getting everything by the end and it just limits early-game creativity. One term that frequently comes to mind when I think about Far Cry 2 is "emergent gameplay;" that is, progression that is directed by the player instead of the game. There are unlocks and upgrades, yeah, and there is a reason to get them, but the most prominent progression in the game is that of your own playstyle. You start to learn what weapons, what routes, what tactics work the best for you and work from there- instead of being given a list of skills for your character. I'm a huge fan of the concept of character proficiency, but it just doesn't belong in a game like this, and the fact that Far Cry 2 is so aware of that is really refreshing. You never feel truly forced into a gameplay style or scenario you genuinely dislike, a problem many open-world games suffer from.\n\nThe AI in Far Cry 2 is absolutely insane, to say the least. It's way too smart for its own good much of the time, and while this might seem cheap at times, it's also an excellent catalyst for the aforementioned emergent gameplay and player-directed progression. I remember starting out my initial play through trying to get up close and personal and stealthy, but the AI just isn't stupid enough for that to work. So I shifted to a more distant playstyle- sniping, picking off enemies, constantly on the move- interspersed with aggressive, ballsy assaults when the situation called for it or my position was compromised. Part of the gameplay is learning the AI's tricks and figuring out what works best for you. The AI is advanced enough that there are no glaring exploits to make the game too easy, but at the same time, if you're expecting a stealth shooter you're going to be disappointed. It really contributes to a feeling of overall cerebrality- you can be great at shooters but if you don't plan your moves you won't get far. It's worth mentioning by now that I've been playing with a realism mod on Infamous difficulty, which really is the only way to play as far as I'm concerned. The enemies are a little too spongy in vanilla, but the setup I use can be brutally difficult yet is rarely ever unfair.\n\nThe gameplay requires analysis and personal experience and I can admit I was frustrated early game that nothing I did seemed to work- probably one of the biggest reasons this game isn't better remembered- but when you get it down the core gameplay is both elegantly simple and constantly engaging, while always feeling personally rewarding.\n\nMoving onto some of the weaker points, the sound design is a mixed bag, with guns sounding stock and animations not always syncing properly with sounds, but the ambient noise, dynamic soundtrack and enemy chatter are all pretty memorable.\n\nIt was at this point in the review I ran out of mentally pre-rehearsed stuff to say. I'm not good at properly reviewing stuff. But yeah this game's rad so play it if it sounds like something you'd play.","March 7, 2014","true","40.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It's more closely related to games like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. than any of the other games in the Far Cry series.  It's brutally unforgiving and slanted more towards realism and immersion than action-adventure.  The world is large, but exploration isn't necessarily a large part of the gameplay, as the only real purpose for doing so is finding diamonds, hidden tapes, and golden guns -- none of which are particularly essential to the experience of the game.\n\nAt its core, the game is about tense gunfights and missions, and the different tactics you can use to ensure your survival.  The game has a robust array of different systems that organically create compelling moments -- last second escapes into the jungle while bullets whiz past you, guns jamming at the least opportune moment and forcing you to flee for the nearest sign of cover, buddies arriving just in the nic of time to save you from an otherwise unwinnable firefight, enemies whom you thought you had killed crawling to their knees and shooting you in the back for revenge -- the list goes on and on, and I'm still discovering new possibilities after hours of play.  Playing with the music turned off increases the tension in the game IMMENSELY, as you never know if there's an enemy around you just waiting for the perfect time to blast you apart and ruin the last ten minutes of progress you'd made.  You'll find yourself checking every corner, listening intently for footsteps or enemy chatter, and cursing yourself when you inevitably miss that lone gunman who finishes you off as soon as you step into the open.\n\nThe narrative of the game is also smart and very sensible and aware of the topics which it brings up, which is a helluva lot more than you can say for most modern military shooters.  Don't expect to leave this one feeling like the hero.\n\ntldr;\nIt's absolutely brilliant, especially if you're into S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-like games and emergent gameplay.","October 3, 2014","true","25.5"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Long ago I had even anticipated this game to be absolutely awesome, reality however didn't meet my expectations. The original Far cry at the time it appeared was a masterpiece that I enjoyed immensely. It was absolutely gorgeous, engaging to play and overall it just felt good. Far cry number two however falls short or gets you annoyed in several different parts. First of all when I started playing, I wasn't expecting it to be an Africa based awful driving simulator. There's way too much driving around in an open world that has little less activities to do than to shoot at everyone because everyone is extremely mad at you for existing. The world feels empty. How the AI works and behaves is questionable and because the enemy guys' bare chests are actually kevlar or something even sturdier you find yourself asking is this game really a game worth playing. I would go as far to say that it isn't. Too much repetition, too much boring driving and too much forced confrontations with foes that merely want to slow your progress in an annoying way (destroying the engine of your car so you have to stop and fix it).\n\nIt isn't all bad however. It brings up some interesting points in the story off how cruel a civil war truly is, the greed of mankind and all sorts of nasty things. The game can look pretty freaking beautiful at times especially on daytime. Some of the guns feel pretty nice to shoot until they jam or break completely and won't shoot anymore. I did finish the game and at the end I felt both relief and contentment.\n\nThere are just a lot more and better FPS games to be had than this. Don't waste your time. The predecessor of Far Cry 2 was a better game and so is the successor as well. Better to spend your money on something completely different. Or maybe similar but better if the type of game ticks well with you.","January 2, 2014","false","16.0"," 11 of 21 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","11","21","0","1"

Not quite as gritty as S.T.A.L.K.E.R. but also not an overpowered player character experience like Crysis. Both are also great games, but this is the uniquely satisfying middle ground.\n\nBeing an older game, it is more limited by its engine in many regards, such as enemies' strange ability to see the player from incredible distances and snipe with improbable accuracy, but forgiving it the wrinkles of it's age, it's still a great experience and one I would recommend to anyone interested in a realistically-influenced shooter without the complications of "hyper-realism".","November 14, 2014","true","78.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It really gets a worse rap than it deserves, even though many complaints about it are valid.\n\nFirst off, the good. The game is absolutely beautiful. The CryEngine graphics look amazing, from the lush jungles, to the vast deserts, to the dilapidated villages and towns - everything is great. The character models, the vehicles, the water and waterfalls, the shifting weather patterns, the various guns - I can't say enough good things about them. The combat is visceral and satisfying, with realistic effects like guns jamming and breaking from too much use. The AI is generally smart - they communicate, flank, and call in backup, but it's inconsistent, too. Sometimes they stand in the open or leave cover when they shouldn't. Sometimes they have superhuman vision and hearing, other times they can walk right by you and not notice you at all. Overall, though, it's fun to get into firefights, and the game gives you enough leeway to decide if you want to fight up close or from a distance, quietly or loudly. The vehicles handle generally well, with the exception of the horrible hang-gliders, and there are a variety of fun ones to choose from. I really had a lot of fun playing the game for the first 20 hours or so - then the game's faults started to become more and more annoying.\n\nI think the biggest problem with the game is the repetition. The game is far too repetitive to be as long as it is, or maybe it's far too long to be as repetitive as it is, but either way it doesn't play out well. The issue is that you literally do the same 4 or 5 missions over, and over, and over again through the entire game, all while having to drive insane distances to complete the missions, and while constantly having to clear checkpoints you've already fought your way through. Like I said, this wasn't a dealbreaker for me for the first 18 or 20 hours, but at that point I finally reached a major turning point in the plot, looked at my progress and saw that I had only finished about 50% of the game. The game then just pretty much shifted locations, but all the mission types stayed the same, and I decided that I was just getting bored with it. At that point I took a 2-month break from the game. That helped a bit, as I was able to come back in and finish, though still without the joy I had gotten from the first few hours when everything was new and fresh. The fact that the story is incomprehensible and the voice acting was absolutely painful didn't help, though, and made the game more of a chore than it needed to be.\n\nAll in all, it was a fun and amazing-looking game, despite its flaws. I got it cheap, and at 30 hours I sure can't say I didn't get my money's worth. I'd recommend it, just know that you'll have to be patient with it.","November 25, 2013","true","40.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's pretty much the only downside to this game. The fact that you have to inject yourself, fix your car, that rockets fall down only a few metres away from you on occasion and that fire spreads across the land is all very unique and adds to the atmosphere. But like I said, the enemies keep respawning. And I'm not talking about the 'you close your game and the next you start it the enemies have respawned' kind of respawning. No, more like 'enemies respawn within 30 minutes or so' respawning.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TerminalHate/recommended/19900/","TerminalHate","*/+","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TerminalHate/","78 products in account","Beats the ♥♥♥♥ out of 3 in my opinion. This game is a lot like STALKER in that it doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about you. It sort of throws you out into the world and says "Good luck." This isn't the cinematic "The world revolves around you" type of game FC3 was. There's no skill trees or press Q to heal all your HP (aside from limited syringes you carry 3 of that can only be replenished by finding them) or free wallhack or crafting system, but if you're into the hard as ♥♥♥♥ but extremely rewarding with various ways to be played type of game, then this is for you.\n\nThere are a few things common complaints about this game for and I think they're exaggerated and full of ♥♥♥♥.\n\nMalaria - I seriously think people are just looking for ♥♥♥♥ to add to their list of ♥♥♥♥♥ing. Malaria turns your screen yellow and eventually killing you, and you have to take a pill to make it go away (you have 5-7 pills I forget exactly how many). This happens every 40 minutes to an hour I think. The game will warn you when you're on your last pill to, and they're easy to get (go to the church, church will tell you to rescue people a.k.a kill the 2-4 guards outside of a house, the people will give you the pills)\n\nWeapon jamming - I seriously don't even know how this was an issue for anyone. Heres how it works: If your gun is rusted as ♥♥♥♥ it's prone to jamming, and if it jams too many times it can break. Guns you find lying on the ground are always rusted to hell, and guns get from the store (which gives you an infinite supply to replace yours with) are always in mint condition. They take a LONG time to degrade. So if you run out of ammo and need to use an enemies gun then get ready for the risks.\n\nDriving all the way across the map with respawning bases- This is another thing that's exaggerated as ♥♥♥♥. There's a bus system, that's like the stider system in morrowind but free, that can take you to every corner of the map and the center. The only thing that might make it tedious is the respawning checkpoints, but if you use the bus system you'll only have to clear 1-3.\n\nCars breaking down - I think this was an issue for me once every 5 hours of gameplay, and when my car did break down I just jacked the car from whoever shot it up.\n\n\nHere are the ACTUAL flaws with the game IMO:\n\nEnemy AI: The AI is so smart it's not even funny, but theres one key problem. If one enemy sees you they ALL see you, this means if one enemy can see you in a shed then his 5 friends know exactly where you are and shoot you through the shed. Not a serious problem unless you're in an area with permeable cover (kinda rare). This is a serious problem though when snipers show up. In farcry 3 the snipers have a laser, but they don't in 2, so later in the game when you get to snipers all the sudden the entire enemy base knows exactly where you are and you have no idea why.\n\nRepetition: This wasn't an issue for me because I usually mixed things up, but this game is VERY repetetive. You will visit very different elaborately layed out levels, but to do the same thing. There's basically 4 types of missions they give you (assassinate, blow up convoy, save people, blow up/steal something in a base). Sometimes you'll revisit the same area for a different type of mission. Most of the areas have 3 ways to approach them, and theres a variety of weapons to mix your playing style.","July 24, 2015","true","57.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This has a different feel than FC3. More of a raw, gritty, type of atmosphere that is frustratingly fun. Good story line and a nice selection of weapons. Guard shacks always respawn so it's never "safe" to just cruise down the road to your next objective. Random enemies patrolling in vehicles will constantly be a thorn in your side but that's part of the fun. Enemies aren't always easy to spot. They'll hide in the trees and shrubs and they're clothing will annoyingly blend in to the environment around them. I can't count the number of times I've nearly died just trying to figure out where the hell I'm being shot from.

Playing through the campaign at max difficulty (makes you about as squishy as every NPC mook) with the music turned off (when you're on a far hill quietly picking off enemies one by one, hearing intense combat music play definitely throws you out of the moment).\n\n-Your "reputation" acts as your EXP level in the game, and generic NPC's react accordingly. Guards will tell you to f*ck off and frequently threaten you at the beginning of the game, but as you level up their dialogue will descend into professional respect and then to superstitious fear.\n\n-The HUD is very intentionally limited; the only onscreen effects are your health and ammo and they quickly fade when not in use. The map and compass have to be brought up like a weapon, and simulate a real paper map with pages of different scales. Sometime's it's a pain in the ♥♥♥ to be at the very bottom of a map section and not be able to see a decent area around you, but it's frustration with something that would be in real life, not frustration with some contrived immersion-breaking game mechanic so it only adds to the immersion.\n\n-You have to drive everywhere on the map but destinations are often close together and the geocaching side-quests, constant threat of ambush, and the detail put into making the "HUD" map feel real keep transportation from being boring. It's a rush to be looking down at your map, hear a close gunshot, and jolt back to the road to see a patrol that just came around the corner.\n\n-Guns start to jam around after you fire your very limited ammo capacity, but it forces you to plan ahead like a true professional and make full use of your 3 weapons slots. Necessity is the mother of invention, and the situations where you're completely surrounded with everything but your pistol broken because you weren't efficient with your shots make the game memorable. Likewise, the feeling of satisfaction when an outpost hit comes together perfectly because you stored the right backup loadout in your safehouse really seals the deal that you're a true professional and an unstoppable force.\n\n-Despite the game's difficulty, it's very feasible to beat the game without dying. The PC's that you didn't choose to play as can be encountered in-game and and turned into allies, and will rescue you if your health drops to 0. They're not invincible though, and they needed to be protected then met in a safehouse if you want to be rescued again by them.\n\nFar Cry 2 quickly became one of my favorite games because of how it sucked me in, made me feel weak, and then let me slowly adapt to it until I truly felt like the hardcore motherf*cker that I was supposed to be playing. 10/10, would recommend to anyone who wants to get absolutely submerged in a game.","September 25, 2015","true","52.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

After I got the 21. mission it came back again, so I had to quit.\nAnyways here is my review:\n\n+The graphics are decent.\n+The environment is really beautiful. You got deserts, forests, mountains, rivers, cliffs. It is a joy to wander about.\n+There is different types of vehicles, which we are able to fix.\n+A good variety of weapons and upgrades, that we can unlock with our gems. The gems are gained through missions or searching.\n+The map is big.\n+Your old weapons and the ones that you get from your enemies after you killed them can break down or might not function properly, which I found really realistic.\n+There are buddies, that let you finish the mission some other way and help you sometimes when you are on the verge of getting killed.\n\n-As I said earlier, there are some bugs that stop you from completing the game.\n-Literally three quarter of the game consists of driving. The map is huge and you have to drive to everywhere or use the bus. But there is only five bus stops in the game. They are at the four corner of the map and one in the middle, so not very convenient.\n-The story isn't that interesting. Classical civil war story. (I can tell because it is my second playthough, I played it once when I was younger)\n-The voice acting is horrible. The accents are poor and everybody talks very fast without intonation. So it is a little bit hard to understand them, if English is not your native tongue or if you're not very competent.\n-There is two factions in the game, where we get our missions from. We do missions for both of them but even the soldiers of the faction, that we currently do the mission for, attack us because " it's a classified mission." Well, I could say okay for a couple of missions but every freaking one of them is the same so it doesn't make sense and becomes annoying fighting the both.\n-There are enemy posts that we can scout after we kill everyone in there BUT they respawn after 5 minutes so you have to kill them every time you pass by and believe me you will pass by a lot because the game is a freaking driving simulator. You can of course pass by without stopping and killing them but they come with vehicles to shoot at you so you can't actually run away if you aren't lucky. I mean it is good because it gives a challenge but it starts to get on the nerves after a while.\n\nAs I said earlier, I recommend the game even though I couldn't enjoy it that much but I feel like everybody should at least give it a try to see for themselves. I really don't know why I recommend it. :)\n\nSo this was my review. I hope you enjoyed reading it.","February 18, 2015","true","10.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's pretty much the only downside to this game. The fact that you have to inject yourself, fix your car, that rockets fall down only a few metres away from you on occasion and that fire spreads across the land is all very unique and adds to the atmosphere. But like I said, the enemies keep respawning. And I'm not talking about the 'you close your game and the next you start it the enemies have respawned' kind of respawning. No, more like 'enemies respawn within 30 minutes or so' respawning. It gets very frustrating because at times you get the feeling that you have no influence on the gameworld, that you're doing practically everything for nothing. If you can just ignore that then there's a great game waiting for you here.\n\n[Rating: 86/100]","January 3, 2012","true","1.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/recommended/19900/","burshoo","Bushro","http://steamcommunity.com/id/burshoo/","155 products in account","It builds itself on being somewhat realistic, instead of hyperstimulating like its sequels. Hindering mechanics allow you to live out your mercenary power fantasy while still feeling vulnerable,and most of the mechanics are handled in game rather than in menus, so there's very little pausing. At the same time, it remains far simpler in formula compared to similar titles, like Stalker. Much of the game's open world has you doing side missions which, while sticking to very repeated formulas, are still very enjoyable. The faction and story missions, which offer choices within them, are sadly often served to the player in a fashion that gives the player very little choice at first, for example, forcing the player to work for a faction he may not want to. Other than that, it is very open-ended, allowing the player to make any decision about loadout, and almost any story choice. This can lead to permanent consequences if the player is not careful. The end of the game, while linear, neatly ties up the depressing (for all the right reasons) story, which is memorable because it is told through a combination of dialogue and the unique faction missions. Most notable is the deuteragonist, the Jackal, and how you learn most about him through the tapes and the dialogue of other characters.\nThe stealth mechanic is something that is often brought up concerning this game. Many people say that stealth is pointless here, but I must disagree. It's not that stealth is futile; It's that stealth sometimes works in a very realistic manner, and sometimes the enemy can't tell when you accidentally almost step on his heel. Variable, yes, but I have not encounted the supposed clairvoyant AI this game has.\nCons:\n-First, the AI. Having AI that relentlessly pursues in vehicles and takes cover when needed is one thing I wish more games of this style did, to make it feel dangerous, like there's really a group of lunatics chasing me. Then I saw a car full of baddies plunge off a cliff into a river, while I was safely standing several hundred feet away. Why they did this, I have no idea.\n-The graphics. It's not the brown and bloom I have a problem with. In fact, I'd say it sets a very good scene for the atmosphere of the game, and even if you don't want it, you can turn it off in the options. My problem is the pop-in. Maybe it's my toaster of a computer, maybe it's just the game, but it kills my immersion to see everything from billboards to distant hills jump in and out of existence, while enemies and vehicles stay in perfect focus, when I move all of a hundred feet. Also, some of the textures seem stretched, but at least they covered it up with foliage.\n-The sound. The music is too loud, while the talking is too quiet. This can be fixed in the options menu, but when I'm trying to have a talk with someone in a building while there's a firefight raging outside, and the voice of those outdoors are muffled, the voice of the guy talking indoors gets muffled in an identical way. Like, this dude standing two feet in front of me sounds like we're speaking through a wall.\n-Invisible walls. I'm not talking about the edges of the map. The game world needs to end somewhere, and it rarely encourages you to go out that far. The invisible walls on hills, ledges, and fences where it looks like I should be able to jump over simply do not allow it. Why these could not have been covered by actual objects, I do not know.\n-Ubisoft account requirement for a lot of the features. Multiplayer requires a Ubisoft account, as does the promotional content and mapshare (which is sad, because this mapmaker is one of the easiest to use and gives very fine results).\n-Programming errors. Sometimes music tracks loop endlessly if a game is loaded under certain circumstances, requiring a trip back to the main menu, and then another load to the game.\nThe Jackal Tapes are also a bit bugged. Every tape I picked up after the one about the boy with the boots has been about the boy with the boots. Thank heavens for YouTube.\nWhen I take a bus into some of the ceasefire zones, especially later in the game, sometimes a soldier on patrol in the town will just spontaneously die for no reason. It even happened to the APR doorman at Mosate Selao, and the game claimed I broke the ceasefire, so I had to leave and come back to make everyone once again nonhostile.\n\nOther than that, the game is an experience like few others. If you want an open world game that gives you something to do, that makes you actually feel in danger, that punishes you for not taking it seriously, this is for you.","January 29, 2015","true","24.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Environment looks beatiful for a game. Minor gun complaint - the G3K A4 rifle you get should have the same specs as the FAL since they fire the same cartridge in real life and both are capable of taking down a man at 600 meters or further and are basically 1 or 2 shot kills.\nBut Its still interesting/fun in the beginning stages! I'm playing on easy because I'm a wuss and play for fun.\n\nThe vehicle dynamics are improved from FC1, but are still a pain sometimes, but the fact that you can repair them (with one bolt!) is a hoot! Using the map is cool, but a bit clunky and hard to see while avoiding trees.\n\nGo blow stuff up and shoot badguys!\n\n(Updated: Aug31-2015)\n\nFinished it. (Spoilers ahead) here's what I felt:\n\nBasically the game punishes you for playing it well. If you want to finish the game, you cannot just pick a side based on a moral choice: "Which side (UFLL or APR) behave morally and harm fewer civillians?" No - its all about murdering all the other mercs (like you) for money. The game devs decided to make your amoral (immoral, some might argue) character (whichever you choose to play as doesnt matter a bit) fatally flawed in all important areas of the game:\n1) Before you even begin playing, you automatically contract Malaria. So your health is compromised from Day 1. The rest of the game forces you to do humanitarian missions for the Underground (the only "faction" that is for actually helping unarmed citizens) in order to aquire Malaria meds in order for you to stay alive so that you can kill even more mercenaries...on both sides. What if I wanted to work exclusively for the Underground...like "The Machine Gun Preacher"?  (A movie based on a real guy in Africa.) Nope. Can't. Stuck being a selfish A-hole murderer.\n2) Before you even start playing (again) You become a stupid, failed TOOL. Not only do you immediately fail in your mission to "kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ that is arming both sides" - the idea based on a flawed moral statement built upon the liet: "Guns kill people, not the men pulling the triggers...so therefore to secure peace, we must remove guns.", (which makes it SEEM like the player-character has SOME moral compass) but no, you end up unwittingly working for the Jackal the whole game untill the unescapable, unalterable end. You're just a stupid PAWN!\n3) Before you even begin playing (AGAIN) You are predestined to be an ammoral murderer who only exists to kill everyone else you see - eventually even your "friends" whom you have saved and who save you numerous times throughout the entire game and yet, they all make the snap decision based on BS to just betray and kill you (and they just spawn in from space apprently too). And the game gives you no choice but to finish them off instead of healing/sparing them.\n\nI hated finishing this game. I thought I'd get to feel good about the character by the end, (I played as Paul - the Israeli). I thought I'd get to see him GROW as a person - maybe to become a merciful mercenary, who decides: "Even though violence has its place in this messed up world (that is undeniable)  I will CHOOSE a side in this conflict based on moral absolutes. And by these guidelines, I choose how to live, fight, and die..." It shouldn't be based on money, or the ravings of a greedy, dying lunatic Arms Dealer. But the game Devs said: "WRONG! WE will force you to be a martyr no matter which path (detonate dynomite or deliver diamond bribe to border guards) you choose - You will still kill yourself."\n\nStupid...especially when one path could have easily allowed the player to live. But all my choices were made for me before I even began playing. AT LEAST I DIE SAVING REFUGEES AND NOT MURDERING THEM!!! Thank you for throwing me that bone, Ubisoft.\n\nBut mostly its like Ubisoft is saying: "Thanks for buying Far Cry 2, an excericise in moral-dilemas with no "good ending". Enjoy wasting 80 hours of your life as you wander aimlessly through this open world, killing everything you see untill...we make you kill yourself.

Perfect? No, but neither is the rest of the series. Totally satisfying? No, but neither is the rest of the series. Dropping with atmosphere like the knifed fresh corpse of a wilderbeast drips that essential red elixir? You must believe it. And this is a quality that evades the rest of the series entirely.\n\nYou are [I can't remember I've played too many similar games], a face into which a video game camera has been thrust, itself belonging to a body which has been thrust right into the meatgrinder of a central african (I wanna say 'kinda Kenya but more sandy' though this may be entirely incorrect) civil war, complete with savage flora, savage fauna and savage hearts. You begin the game staring wonderously at the bump map'd face of a taxi driver as he drives you deeper and deeper into a threatening looking square of hell - dissapointingly scaled to accomodate the xbox 360 I believe, but certainly impactful - where he drops at a hotel. You get out, get to your room, get to bed and wake up with infected with Malaria and dodging bullets as fighting has broken out in the town.\n\nYou escape. You have no idea where you are. The landscape is alien and scary, the locals seem more like human big cats with AKs and a thirst for blood than video game villains, the roars of labouring car engines spark off immediate "GTFO of here!" sprints for cover, trees flex in the breeze, bushes rustle, a hot sun beats down on you like a express post migraine, and you eventually make it to a safe house where a bunch of uncaring locals welcome you to their collective deathwarrant and start giving you orders. You net some pills for the Malaria - things which will always stick with you and occasionally give you cause to run errands for the missionaries who supply them - and a rusty assault rifle and you're loose - free to do what you will, if you dare.\n\nThe quality of this game is in the oppressive environment which has been really wonderfull captured. Occasional townships light up real nice in dusty battles, blood diamonds litter the map in padded suitcases, militia held checkpoints stare down at you from every hilltop or intersection.\n\nDifficult, yes. Challenging, yes. But inaccesible? No. The completionist in me loved this game - finding diamonds is just so easy, though finding them all would be a very lengthy mission indeed. Discovering every portion of the map, likewise a treat in itself. Ticking off enemy base camps and noting down the location of weapons stashes for future reference, all of these tasks are seamless and require one to go out of one's way only very rarely. The sandbox gameplay is so dense and rewarding infact that the campaign is almost a saddle on it - a key final mission of the opening zone became markedly less imposing for me when I realized that it was set in a clifftop fortress which I had comprehensively massacred on my first day in country.\n\nComplete that story, those missions, though, because they will eventually open up new areas for you to explore, new people for you to meet (interactable characters are rare but convincing) and new atmosphere to soak up.\n\nThis game is a simulator, a simulator of that gritty, horrifying mode of hot Central African civil war that movies like Blood Diamond and co just about hinted at. It is not the best game ever made, and it is no the best game available on these pages, but it is a good one, and I would recommend it ahead of the next two games in the series. Or the third one at least, which completely failed to live up to the achievements of this title.","April 23","true","16.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It is quite a long game, especially if you finish all side missions. Playing on and off for a few weeks and using a map showing all diamond case locations, I got through the campaign in about 25 hours.\n\nI think my main issue was that every mission was the exact same. Blow this up or kill that person. I do enjoy 'splosions and assassination missions, but nothing changes in the world as you go through the campaign, so playing them gets mundane quickly.\n\nThe world itself is large. I loved the day/night cycle and weather. The thing that aggravated me the most about traveling in this world was the rapidly respawning guard shacks. You wipe out everyone in the area, drive down the road for a bit, turn back around, and voila, everyone is back. It feels like an annoying tactic to make the game last longer than it should. I'd understand guards being there after 6 in-game hours or something, but just getting out of sight of the area shouldn't prompt automatic respawns.\n\nFar Cry 2 was quite a change from the original. While I appreciated some changes, the lack of an engaging narrative and repetitive missions/opponents made this game more of a bore the longer it lasted.\n\n5/10\n\n","January 2, 2015","false","36.0"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","10","21","0","0"

(Before entering real combat, that is.) Large variety. Animation's decent, sound effects are excellent, and they tear up landscape pretty good. Poorly maintained guns jam and misfire in varying ways. Firing guns in this game leaves me with a headache and ringing ears... in a good way.\n\n+ Certain aspects are very immersive. You're stuck in Africa. You haven't much to rely on beyond your non-pausing map, health syringes, and safe havens. Ammo and health can burn quickly. Keep moving and stay alive.\n\n+ Asthetically, the map is good. Feels like Africa based on the five or six Nationa Geographic shots I've seen.\n\n+ As many have said, fire is fun. Tall grass and foliage burn up quickly and in large quantities.\n\n+ Visuals haven't aged too poorly. Very serviceable considering the years this game has on it.\n\n+ Some neat dynamic enemy behavior. They talk between each other during combat appropriate to what just happened. They'll sling their wounded buddies over their shoulder and run for cover.\n\n+ The malaria pill fetching reminded me of Zombrex in Dead Rising 2... which was a better game I'd been reminded I could be playing.\n\n\nCONS:\n\n\n- Enemy AI sporadically changes between dirt dumb and brilliant. Enemies can miss shots within three feet of you, but nail you in your moving vehicle a hundred yards away. Enemies can not detect you when you crouch right next to them, but discover you crouched in tall grass from a hundred yards away. Weapons they nail you with across the map are pitifully inaccurate when you pick them up and use them youself. They can even detect you THROUGH COVER, often shooting through thinner walls nailing you perfectly.\n\n- Not all guns do not behave predictably. Multiple close quarters headshots with 7.62 ammunition can serve to just stun an enemy. An entire pistol magezine loaded into an enemy's body still has him up and about shooting.\n\n- The map is littered with enemy holdouts. Not a problem in Far Cry 3. When you invade these incampments in FC3, you can clear them out, permanently. In this game, killing everyone in the outpost means: They all respawn! Not even ten real life minutes later! Over sixty of these ♥♥♥♥ing things are upon every major road and water way. If you want to drive for more than two minutes, you'll run into one of these encampments. Your best bet is to floor it through them, and even that doesn't work well. Enemies chip away at your health every time you drive past. Often they'll scramble a vehicle to follow you. No firing weapons in vehicles, your best defense is to bail out, shoot your persuers, repair your car for the umptenth time, and keep moving.\n\n- As many have said, Malaria is an arbitrary difficulty complication. Another example of where this game favors "realism" over "immersion". Every 30 real life minutes you suffer an incurable malaria attack. To not pass out and restart at a safehouse, you need to take Malaria pills. You CAN NOT acquire these pills willingly! You need to progress through the story to get them! Should you decide you want to do the side content for a couple hours, get used to passing out and restarting every once in a while.\n\n- Not much to do outside of the main story. Side missions pretty much always consist of killing everyone in an enemy camp or blowing up a vehicle.\n\n- Story's thread bare. That doesn't matter too much. What DOES matter pretty much every character is horridly voice acted. The actors sound like text-to-speech machines; monotone and rarely giving appropriate inflections. For some strange reason, the game often speeds up their lines as well. They talk as if commas and periods don't exist.\n\n- Random bugs. I've encountered bugs where unpausing causes you to automatically throw a grenade, one where switching to my primary weapon caused my character to start walking to the right for some reason, bugs where vehicles would automatically reverse when I entered them. They all fixed themselves when I restarted the game, but it was rather odd and annoying that they were there in the first place.\n\n\nI wanted to enjoy this game. I was told "Far Cry 3 without the handholding." At its core, this game is solid. Little design flaws like braindead AI and the constant attacks from guard outposts every five minutes become incredibly bothersome when the game is littered with them. Stealth is almost nonfunctional. Loud combat is buggy but sometimes servicable.\n"Immersion" in this game boils down to something like a Grand Theft Auto game where cops won't come after you for murder but will give you a speeding ticket without fail. The unfun components (malaria, cars frequently breaking down, enemies tracking you) compromise the often-breaking components of fun.\nMy only consolation is I bought this for $2.49. Buy this game on sale if you like unpredictable non-stop hordes of dumb enemies and tearing up the African desert in a boastfully product-placed Jeep.","October 14, 2015","false","25.3"," 8 of 17 people (47%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","47","8","17","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelonesoldier/recommended/19900/","thelonesoldier","Cyrix","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thelonesoldier/","188 products in account","I'm generally a fan of free-roam first-person shooters, but Far Cry 2 was a big disappointment. If you're a hardcore shooter fan that likes a challenge, solid gunplay, diverse gameplay, and refreshing mechanics, this isn't the shooter for you.\n\nNearly every quest boils down to "drive to the other side of the map and kill some people / blow something up". There is no variety in enemies - you face thugs with low health and bad AI toting rifles, or thugs with low health and bad AI toting shotguns, or thugs driving trucks with mounted machine guns on the back. There is very little recoil to any of the automatic weapons, which really hurts the gunplay. As a result, none of the traditional firearms are fun or interesting - if you are in it for the grenade launchers, double-barrel shotguns, and flamethrowers, you might have more fun than I did.\n\nThe game is pathetically easy even with the difficulty maxed - I had to install a mod that further increases the difficulty and weapon recoil just to feel like I wasn't playing a kids' game. The only moments when the game is difficult are when the AI is cheating - bullets can penetrate sheet metal and thin wood, which is cool, but the enemies can see through anything they can shoot through. Taking cover in a shack or some brush is signing your own death warrant, because your enemies will continue shooting you accurately even though you can't see them. This isn't some intelligent "he went into that shack so I'll shoot at the shack" AI - they can just see through walls, and they'll do it whether or not anyone saw you enter.\n\nThe game certainly has its moments - the first time I was rescued by a buddy was one of the most memorable experiences I've had in gaming (but the buddy-rescue system quickly gets stale and sometimes becomes a nuisance when you have to babysit your buddy for 20 ****ing minutes so they don't get killed). The large and diverse landscape is a refreshing change from the scenery in most shooters - you certainly feel like you're in Africa. I found the unique realism elements - the map you physically hold in front of you in the game (accurately simulates crashing while looking down at the map!) repairing vehicles, weapons that degrade in quality, and fire propagation, very interesting.\n\nThere isn't much of a story to the game - you can take random copy-and paste quests all over the map (I am not joking about copy-and-paste) or take story quests from either of the two factions in the central town. Neither faction represents the "good" side, so I felt no connection with the events in place beyond getting paid diamonds to complete missions. I guess that's how a mercenary would look at things, but it doesn't make for an engaging game in my case.\n\nFar Cry 2 has some good ideas, but overall the game doesn't quite click for me. On the other hand, there are a lot of positive reviews for it, so your milage may vary.","December 29, 2013","false","15.9"," 6 of 13 people (46%) found this review helpful","46","6","13","0","1"

Лично мне в чем-то понравилась больше чем 3я часть. Так как это не простой экшн-стелс, тут враги "не хотят умирать",могут закричать когда в них стреляют с глушителя и могут увидеть или услышать когда ты крадешься рядом (в  FarCry3 тебя и спереди то с трудом увидят). Это все придает реалистичность и атмосферность. И то что трава и деревья не зеленые, а серо-желтые и это тоже, джунги надоели.  Особое отличие - изнашивание заклинивание оружия, нигде такого не встретишь. Враг на прицеле, а оружие заклинило, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥АА!

It's a dull and beaten vision with no wonders to uncover or surprises to stumble onto. Though it looked great at it's heyday, the years have not been kind to it. The game has aged terribly having both the design and mechanics feel old and tired.\n\nI can see how they wanted to create this huge open-world game but didn't really have anything to fill it with so they just cluttered the map with all the same stuff. As the result you'll get a game where you've seen it all after a couple hours of gameplay. It does have it's moments, like the brutal self-surgeries that you have to perform or the jamming weapons that make the battles feel more real but those sparks are drowned in the myriad of flaws the game has to offer.\n\nEvery...Single...Misson follows same pattern:\n1. Get mission.\n2. Drive to the other side of Africa.\n3. Grind through endless guard posts.\n4. Repair car.\n5. Repeat steps 3 & 4 till you contract malaria from playing the game.\n6. Take malaria pill.\n7. Kill a village-full of sharp-shooters.\n8. Save game or you have to do it all over again because there's no autosave.\n9. Get new mission AND DO EXACTLY THE SAME THING ALL OVER AGAIN!\n\nThe Battles:\n- A.I. always knows where you are, even if you switch positions.\n- Enemies have perfect aiming, even from hundreds of meters away, in the middle of the night!\n- You can not guess from what direction you are being shot at. You could not even tell if you are moving towards the shooter, or away from him!\n- You get shot the very second you peek from behind a cover.\n- Enemies who speak to each other sound like they are just around the corner even if they are far away.\n- Enemies are able to hit you in the middle of the night, with a shotgun, from a hundred meters away, from behind an house!\n\nThe game's full of bugs too:\n- Mission givers heads shake like crazy when you interact with them.\n- Random guy fell from the sky to his death in front of me.\n- In bar objects floating without table underneath.\n- Misson givers voice and gestures occasionally out of place.\n- A.I. shooting you from behind the cover.\n- Fixed machine guns fail to hit targets at close range, rendering them completely useless.\n- Enemy shooting AND hitting you while having his back turned towards you.\n\nVerdict:\nI think I would have loved the game back in the time when it came out but it just doesn't compete with anything the industry produces today. Consider modding the game which will improve it enough to look exciting for an extra couple hours. The 10 hours I put in this game feel like an excessive waste of time.","November 1, 2015","false","10.1"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The follow-up to FC 1 - not developed by Crytek which should focus on the to-be-released first Crysis that would set new standards in graphics and enactment in FPS in the day, but Ubisoft Montreal instead  - which was a great sandbox/openworld shooter promised many things and many hands-on by Game magazines made me long for this game back in the day.\nIt should became some years later until I finally managed to get my hands on it during a steam sale and I was pretty disappointed after the credits rolled.\n\nStrange thing is, the Ideas the developers had for this game sounded really great: A breathing, living, open world, choosing a side between different factions, a buddy-system, choices and consequences, degrading weapons (first FPS-game since System Shock 2 that had this mechanic at least from the games I know of), gorgeous visuals... I mean, what's not to love ? Well, Practice turned out different than Theory.\n\nWell, first let's focus on the things the Game got right.\n\nAn open world with gorgeous visuals, day-and-night rhythm, great physics, realistic Fire, vegetation...\nReally fun fights, great gunplay with degrading weapons, weapon jams, well-balanced that makes for a gritty, ruthless atmosphere\nInteresting setting in a nameless african country in civil war with two different factions ...\n"Buddies" that come to help and give you new missions ...\nclever AI for the most part...\nLots of missions...\nA great staged kick-off into the game...\nnow the bad and the ugly:\n\n... that feels not alive. Aside from some alibi-fauna animals the wolrd is pretty much empty. Where are the citizens ? How come I only encounter the same clone-rebells on the street ? It seems more like a great postcard idyll than a living, breathing world that goes it's way regardless what the player does.\n... that quickly becomes very stale because of lousy gamedesign. A country at civil war yet there are no citizens to be encountered in the world apart from a few refugees, the chaplain, a doctor and some others ? Just feels false. It doesn't matter and has no consequences for which faction you decide. Killed the villain on top of the organisation of the other group ? Doesn't matter, they welcome you with open arms for your next mission. Sabotaged something ? Doesn*t feel like it made any difference at all. The other faction becoming weaker because of your actions i.e. less Enemies etc. Not at all. Shooting the same ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s at the road block that you razed to the ground 5 minutes ago ? Your faction shooting at you because the mission is "secret" (Well by that definition, every mission in FC2 is "secret") ? ♥♥♥♥ it, just shoot anyone ! A Story that seems to unfold while making missions ? Nope. Bad Guy X gets replaced by bad Guy Y, same thing over again.\n... and are completely useless because you develop no relationship to them and gain nothing by helping them other than having a savegame less bc they come help you in case of death. Buddy dies in a fight with others ? ♥♥♥♥ it, you will get another one at the next bar. So why implement them in the first place ? Cynic, much ?\nother than a few times where they stand in front of you doing nothing or having wall-hack and sniping you from 2 km away. On hard difficulties, they are bullet sponges, not realistic at all. Shoot someone without kevlar west with an MG 5-7 times ? Doesn't matter to him, he will still shoot at you. Another super annoying issue is that enemies at "liberated" outposts and road-blocks respawn almost immidately. You're on a mission driving from A to B just to drive the same route back having to kill the bad guys twice, dying and repeating the ♥♥♥♥ all over again if you're unlucky ? Well, don't say I didn't warn you.\nthat play out the same: deliver X, kill bad guy Y, Sabotage Z, Deactivate J ... Seriously ?\nthat becomes incredible boring and tedious. Story ? Nope, this game doesn't have one aside from some alibi-characters and twists see coming before.\n\n\nSo... Ubisoft wanted to create a real, living, dark, gritty world in which the players actions shall have consequences and he can choose how to approaoch with a interesting story and different factions. The world seems real, dark and gritty, but it isn't because you have restraints. You have NO Story, your choices make NO difference, you can NOT choose how to approach a situation (other than the fights, they are as fun and open as open-world can be, even when stealth is difficult bc. of wallhack AI for example). So in the end, the game is more annoying, frustrating and cynic than fun or interesting. Let's make a stupid comparison: If Ubisoft got the task to paint a picture, they have gotten the most beautiful colors, brushes and pencils, but made one of the worst images I ever saw.\n\n\n\nNot recommended, try FC3 or FC4 instead.\n\nPS: Don't get fooled by the small playtime, I started FC2 in a different way due to problems with steam and so steam didn't count any Gaming hours. Actually I played it twice just to see if it would play any different by choosing other characters, etc. It did not. started FC2 a different way","January 30, 2015","false","0.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I've only gotten through a few missions now and I'm already sorry I gave it another shot. While the visuals are fairly impressive, there are so many aspects of this game that make it bad.\n\nFC 3 did a great job of addressing the major issues with FC2 which, in when you compare the two games, really makes you aware of how bad FC2 is. The biggest problem is how long it takes to get anywhere. Traveling by vehicle speeds up your travel time, but the terrain is setup so you almost always have to go around any hills, even short ones. The map system is meant to mimic having a real map in your hand, but since you can only get a close-up view of the section you’re currently in, you can’t look around other areas to see if there is anything interesting you may want to explore. You also can’t add a waypoint to where you want to go, so when you’re traveling you constantly need to have the map deployed in order to keep visual track of where you’re trying to get to.\n\nThe ability to easily kill enemies isn’t consistent with logic. Headshots don’t always instantly kill an enemy, which I can understand if you’re at a distance and you potentially don’t get the shot dead on. However, standing right next to an enemy and shooting them in the head at point-blank range doesn’t always kill them instantly either. It would make sense that a shotgun blast to any part of the body should at least cause them to fall down, but I would frequently unload three shots at point-blank range before they tumble.\n\nThere are a number of other problems with the game, but just the combination of these two factors make the game difficult to enjoy.","December 2, 2015","false","12.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It has beautiful scenery and effects.\n\nBut it is little more than a console game ported to PC. You spend more time traveling (and clearing the same guardpost of people 5 minutes later if you have to turn around) than you do anything else.\n\nThe gameplay is unimaginative, the AI is pretty dumb and predictable (but not always), there is not much as far as interaction beyond shooting, and you have to grind to get any decent weapons.\n\nIt's a novelty. I played for about 30 hours and decided I really didn't care to keep spending 80% of my time traveling somewhere to get an assignment on the other end of the map and rescuing my idiot "friends" who kept on doing things like trying to assault an entire convoy on their own and getting mortally wounded before I showed up.\nIn short, they should have tried harder. You'll have more fun watching youtube clips than actually playing it.","March 8","false","32.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

I've only gotten through a few missions now and I'm already sorry I gave it another shot. While the visuals are fairly impressive, there are so many aspects of this game that make it bad.\n\nFC 3 did a great job of addressing the major issues with FC2 which, in when you compare the two games, really makes you aware of how bad FC2 is. The biggest problem is how long it takes to get anywhere. Traveling by vehicle speeds up your travel time, but the terrain is setup so you almost always have to go around any hills, even short ones. The map system is meant to mimic having a real map in your hand, but since you can only get a close-up view of the section you’re currently in, you can’t look around other areas to see if there is anything interesting you may want to explore. You also can’t add a waypoint to where you want to go, so when you’re traveling you constantly need to have the map deployed in order to keep visual track of where you’re trying to get to.\n\nThe ability to easily kill enemies isn’t consistent with logic. Headshots don’t always instantly kill an enemy, which I can understand if you’re at a distance and you potentially don’t get the shot dead on. However, standing right next to an enemy and shooting them in the head at point-blank range doesn’t always kill them instantly either. It would make sense that a shotgun blast to any part of the body should at least cause them to fall down, but I would frequently unload three shots at point-blank range before they tumble.\n\nThere are a number of other problems with the game, but just the combination of these two factors make the game difficult to enjoy.","December 2, 2015","false","12.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And it speaks to me.  This game is truly a far cry (no pun intended) from the original; the first game being a sci-fi shooter involving genetic mutations that held a very 80's-90's vibe in its approach; but it is by no means a far cry in a negative way.  To be honest this game manages to successfully convey a message that I myself already more or less knew; whether or not it did so on purpose remains to be seen.\n\nI have a lot of positive and negative experiences in this game.  The main negative is probably that it is a very long game that does a lot of repeating itself; clear a safe house, track a checkpoint, do a convoy mission here, an assassination mission there, rage at some OP patrol car with a grenade launcher in that direction and so on.  Despite this I managed to finish the game and walked away feeling like it was a great experience.  You essentially go through war-torn Africa on the hunt for an arms dealer whose guns are potentially further aggrivating a very intense and deadly conflict.  You get to see the decay and decadance caused by a society in conflict, one that is trying its hardest to decide whether it should be westernized or remain its own culture but unable to choose between both, and you make friends and enemies along the way.  But you realize as you keep collecting diamonds and using them to buy new weapons and equipment that you slowly are starting to lose yourself, and it's only by the end when you see everything coming to a standstill that you truly realize just how far you've come...and just how much you've lost yourself in the process.\n\nI know that's pretty philisophical for a review, but this game has left me feeling philisophical.  It's honestly a great game to play.\n\nNow before I close this review I do feel obligated to point a few things out, especially for people looking to play the game.  This game, while old, has the right kind of bugs that makes it YouTube gold.  Probably the most infamous bug in my playthrough was when NPCs wouldn't stand still and kept deciding that they were on a punching bag stand (in my first attempt to play the game I saw a bunch of villagers bobbing up and down and literally thought that they were doing some sort of ritualistic African jumping dance for some reason XD).  Less fun bugs includes the bug involving the Jackal Tapes (which you will find out in the forums), as well as the occasional crashes that occur in between saves (word to the wise, keep extra save files, becuase some people have had corrupted saves occur deep into the game), but there is nothing that's absolutely game breaking.  I will also point out that unlike future Far Cry games the animals aren't hostile and are more of an interactive element, which is a shame considering that I feel like a game set in Africa that didn't include at least one mission involving an African Safari Hunt was a missed opportunity.\n\nIf you've played any of the other games (3, 4, and Primal) and want to try something closer to the roots, or if you're into old fashioned shooters but want something less linear and more free roam than the original, Far Cry 2 is for you.\n\n-Kerian","April 25","true","56.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It comes alive in spectacular style and is one of the most realistic of all the fictional locales used in today´s PC games. The guns, the glory, the greed all merge and create an authentic and powerful story. Driven by an excellent gameplay engine, Far Cry 2 enables you to fight in a variety of ways, from employing stealth to outright firefighting. You can kill you enemies silently from afar, using the vegetation as your cover, or engage in gun battles in a variety of ways. The hillsides offer excellent fallback positions and allow you to plan your next  move. Whether you want to pick everyone out in an area using your sniper rifle, or burrow  your way through their compounds and outposts, Far Cry 2 will offer you ample chances to do both.\n\nThis installment offers a wide diversity of of weapons,  manual loading, semi automatic  and fully automatic. Explosive weapons are also available. Some come with their own scopes, allowing you to sniper bomb enemy cars before, or after the driver and his fellow soldiers get in.  The grass and trees can be set on fire, allowing you to create a shield of fire to drive the enemies while you reposition yourself and shoot them before they can regain their bearings.\n\nA serious game for a veteran player, Far Cry 2 is a haven for the creative killer, the adventurer and the explorer. Get it, if you really want to see the wild side of Africa in all its glory.","January 1, 2014","true","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

No other game comes quite as close as this for making action feel intense and realistic through the combination of solid gameplay, unmatched sound and amazing graphics- especially the fire. The game itself is open world but it's not a GTA or anything like that, and the story mode's missions are repetitive, but you feel like you're there and fighting to survive. An incredible game- deserves more credit- and should not be seen as a shooter or open-world, but more of an immersive, single player experience.","December 27, 2011","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It plays like a "sandbox FPS" giving the player a large area to maneuver and a number of things to do, including "main story" missions and side quests.  The character of the land is generally dry desert and jungle with a few bodies of water.  The main story is interesting and well executed, with a few opportunities for "improvising" your approach to a conflict similar to Crysis.  I like in particular the way the game tries to keep you in the game world, such as when viewing the map.

From glitches with characters and the environment all the way to a persistent buzzing I would hear over my speakers...there were far too many to fix and I eventually gave up.  This game is unplayable...  The most game breaking glitch was having characters who, once talked to, would move and thus ruin the speech script.  Ever have a character say one line, move and thus reset itself?  Thereby saying that one line over and over and over and over until you found that one exact sweet spot for it to finish the sentence and start the next sentence, only to have the character move its arm or turn it head and thus repeat the same problem?  That is what happened to me...over and over and over again...  Ugh...  I applied fix after fix to encounter more and more problems.  The opening scene where you are driven around in the taxi was the first problem.  The NPCs would get in front of the car (while literally BOUNCING around the screen) and thus stop the entire sequence.  Only several reloads and pure luck got me through that.  Add in all the glitches with that persistent buzzing I would hear over the speakers (read around, it is a common problem) and the game went from frustrating to ANNOYINGLY frustrating.  All in all, if you luck out and get the game to work for you...you are fortunate.

Though players can attempt to tackle the game as they would a sandbox actioner, Far Cry 2 requires a more measured response. There is a lot driving to do, but it feels real to do so. The environment is a harsh and unforgiving place, just as you may expect. Yet, that every living soul outside of a safe zone wants to kill you (and even those in safe zones would love an excuse to kill you) is slightly less 'real'. At the start of the game, your driver negotiates a trade so as to gain passage through a checkpoint. Sadly, that kind of mechanic is for cutscenes only. The only toll is paid in bullets and blood. While exciting at first, the realisation that when next you pass through those enemies will have returned to fight again, can become frustrating. However, those issues aside, the game is rich and fluid. FPS fans will squeeze a lot of fun times from this game, though they may never finish it.","February 22, 2014","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It has a lot of cool elements, and a lot of not so cool ones, but the game did a lot right. The story is kind of boring and falls apart almost directly after the intro. The game is highly open world like Far Cry 1, but that's where the similarities end. The game has major AI problems, don't trust Ubisoft. If you walk up behind an enemy, and hit them with your knife, and completely kill them with no one in sight or nearby, all the enemies in the area will know where you are right away. You cannot sneak around enemies, you cannot fool them into thinking you're in another spot. The graphics look nice, the gun play is solid, and the health system is fairly cool. The game just really feels dull at times sadly, and could have used a less linear feel. The quests in the game felt almost randomly generated and lacked any personality. Almost no characters in the game besides the man you're hired to kill have personality. Overall, 8/10.","June 17, 2012","true","16.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Though players can attempt to tackle the game as they would a sandbox actioner, Far Cry 2 requires a more measured response. There is a lot driving to do, but it feels real to do so. The environment is a harsh and unforgiving place, just as you may expect. Yet, that every living soul outside of a safe zone wants to kill you (and even those in safe zones would love an excuse to kill you) is slightly less 'real'. At the start of the game, your driver negotiates a trade so as to gain passage through a checkpoint. Sadly, that kind of mechanic is for cutscenes only. The only toll is paid in bullets and blood. While exciting at first, the realisation that when next you pass through those enemies will have returned to fight again, can become frustrating. However, those issues aside, the game is rich and fluid. FPS fans will squeeze a lot of fun times from this game, though they may never finish it.","February 22, 2014","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It plays like a "sandbox FPS" giving the player a large area to maneuver and a number of things to do, including "main story" missions and side quests.  The character of the land is generally dry desert and jungle with a few bodies of water.  The main story is interesting and well executed, with a few opportunities for "improvising" your approach to a conflict similar to Crysis.  I like in particular the way the game tries to keep you in the game world, such as when viewing the map.

It comes alive in spectacular style and is one of the most realistic of all the fictional locales used in today´s PC games. The guns, the glory, the greed all merge and create an authentic and powerful story. Driven by an excellent gameplay engine, Far Cry 2 enables you to fight in a variety of ways, from employing stealth to outright firefighting. You can kill you enemies silently from afar, using the vegetation as your cover, or engage in gun battles in a variety of ways. The hillsides offer excellent fallback positions and allow you to plan your next  move. Whether you want to pick everyone out in an area using your sniper rifle, or burrow  your way through their compounds and outposts, Far Cry 2 will offer you ample chances to do both.\n\nThis installment offers a wide diversity of of weapons,  manual loading, semi automatic  and fully automatic. Explosive weapons are also available. Some come with their own scopes, allowing you to sniper bomb enemy cars before, or after the driver and his fellow soldiers get in.  The grass and trees can be set on fire, allowing you to create a shield of fire to drive the enemies while you reposition yourself and shoot them before they can regain their bearings.\n\nA serious game for a veteran player, Far Cry 2 is a haven for the creative killer, the adventurer and the explorer. Get it, if you really want to see the wild side of Africa in all its glory.","January 1, 2014","true","0.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

From glitches with characters and the environment all the way to a persistent buzzing I would hear over my speakers...there were far too many to fix and I eventually gave up.  This game is unplayable...  The most game breaking glitch was having characters who, once talked to, would move and thus ruin the speech script.  Ever have a character say one line, move and thus reset itself?  Thereby saying that one line over and over and over and over until you found that one exact sweet spot for it to finish the sentence and start the next sentence, only to have the character move its arm or turn it head and thus repeat the same problem?  That is what happened to me...over and over and over again...  Ugh...  I applied fix after fix to encounter more and more problems.  The opening scene where you are driven around in the taxi was the first problem.  The NPCs would get in front of the car (while literally BOUNCING around the screen) and thus stop the entire sequence.  Only several reloads and pure luck got me through that.  Add in all the glitches with that persistent buzzing I would hear over the speakers (read around, it is a common problem) and the game went from frustrating to ANNOYINGLY frustrating.  All in all, if you luck out and get the game to work for you...you are fortunate.  As for me, I am truly and greatly disappointed with this game.","June 20, 2015","false","1.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/UberNoodle/recommended/19900/","UberNoodle","UberNoodle","http://steamcommunity.com/id/UberNoodle/","191 products in account","Far Cry 2 is a pretty game, even today, with an expansive world of reasonable variety. Though players can attempt to tackle the game as they would a sandbox actioner, Far Cry 2 requires a more measured response. There is a lot driving to do, but it feels real to do so. The environment is a harsh and unforgiving place, just as you may expect. Yet, that every living soul outside of a safe zone wants to kill you (and even those in safe zones would love an excuse to kill you) is slightly less 'real'. At the start of the game, your driver negotiates a trade so as to gain passage through a checkpoint. Sadly, that kind of mechanic is for cutscenes only. The only toll is paid in bullets and blood. While exciting at first, the realisation that when next you pass through those enemies will have returned to fight again, can become frustrating. However, those issues aside, the game is rich and fluid. FPS fans will squeeze a lot of fun times from this game, though they may never finish it.","February 22, 2014","true","7.1"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The environment is beautiful even at a low setting, and the characters you play as and meet are equally diverse and morally-vague. The realism and heart put into the storyline and scanarios really did suprise me in how sad but still enjoyable it was. It felt like I was both playing a game and watching a newscast right out of Africa. The open-world is fun, the weapons are varied and simple to use (you'll hear people complain about the weapon jamming but it isn't really a problem so long as you come prepared) the Fortunes DLC is a nice treat when bought on sale, and the missions will last you a long time.\n\nI call this the best Farcry game ever made for it's new features not used in later games, fun but viceral narrative, lots and lots to do without even needing to buy more DLC, and more importantly NO FREAKING EAGLES!!! Seriously am I the only one who felt terrible having to kill endangered species in the later games? Farcry 2 doesn't have that.","June 16, 2015","true","64.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Spent a few hours wandering from one brown mudhole to the next, getting shot up and then rescued by mercenaries who I guess I'm friends with? No story, no direction, just endless brown landscapes and frustrating gunfights. Having to hike back to the church every 30 minutes because of malaria is also ridiculous and busywork.\n\nAnd before you ask, no, I did NOT play Far Cry 3 before playing this game and thus get desensitized. But I did install that game instead and found it to be infinitely superior. Play the first Far Cry, skip this one, and play the rest after that.

Far superior to Far Cry 3.  Certain aspects of this game make me want to hate it, but in turn, drive me to beat it, to be better. Strangly enough, since any other game I would just lower the difficulty or uninstall and call it a crappy game. Not this.\n\nFinished the game, doing all the missions and bonus missions in 30 hours on Infamous. Don't play it on any other difficulty or it will ruin the game. Realistic in certain aspects which is great, such as getting killed in one shot and jammed weapons in a firefight. That might not seem fun, but it forces you to become a better player. Scavenging for supplies, ammo, and health is great. You don't carry hundreds of rounds or 10 rockets as in other games. You have to preserve your ammo, and your time.\n\nDidn't like driving everywhere, although it adds to the realism. The buddies really added to the game. You have to play to the end to find out why. One of the best endings in any game. Hundred times better than Far Cry 3, whose ending left me saying wtf with three question marks. Far Cry 2's ending ties together the entire game, and is drastically different from any other game.\n\nAt the end of Far Cry 3, I felt as if I wasted my time, although it was fun. Both endings had no closure, and one of them was plain stupid. It wasn't realistic in many aspects. Far Cry 3 ruined it completely with its voice-over and cutscenes. Far Cry 2 made me feel as if I was in Africa for 30 hours, fighting the fight. At the end of Far Cry 2, I felt as if I died. And you know what, it was worth it.\n","December 26, 2013","true","29.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

I can't make myself play any longer, this game is really tedious and poorly written, hence there is nothing what could keep me going.\n\nThis game is ok shooter. But it's not so action filled to actually enjoy the game solely because of this, there is too much gaps in between. The gameplay is rather slow and consists mostly of you driving from point A to point B through copy-pasted enemy controlled checkpoints (which are everywhere) to do your usually absolutely meaningless business. Every action starts from you driving at least a couple of minutes. Don't waste your time cleaning checkpoints, they will respawn as soon as you turn the corner.\n\nQuests are all stupid fetch quests and main quests are no different. Story is so disjointed and sparse I was lost in the beginning because game doesn't take time to explain you anything. The only source of information about the situation is your journal, which consist of 1 (one) entry in it, and "accidentally" heard 10 seconds dialogue between bosses when you come to them to take another go-kill quest. Trough the first act Jackal appeared twice for about 1 minute total, saying some cryptic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. That's about all the story I got.

However, I found that instead I was frequently infuriated with the enemy AI constantly pinpointing me in a bush at midnight a mile away and I quickly grew tired of the amount of tedious travel required to get from any point of the map to the other.\n\nUpon release I’m sure this was a must own title, but with the availability of Far Cry 3 and the (hopefully decent) soon to be released Far Cry 4, I don’t think this game has much to offer anyone anymore.\n\nCertainly not a terrible game if you can pick it up for a dollar, but nothing to jump at.","November 17, 2014","false","18.9"," 38 of 78 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","38","78","0","3"

But such beauty can hardly be appreciated when it's guarded by dozens of outposts populated by ever-respawning enemies who will always shoot you on sight - regardless of your current allegiance to their faction (!!!).\n\nAdd to that the fact that fast-travelling is very limited in this game, and that most missions require you to go from point A to point B using the same routes over and over, and you got yourself one of the least pleasant experiences you could imagine as far as first-person shooters go.\n\nHonestly, I can't stress this enough. Avoid Far Cry 2 at all costs.

There are enemy camps littered all over the map and you can't just drive through them; not only will the enemies start shooting at you instantly, they will even give chase. You can clear out the camps but as far as I can tell they get repopulated as soon as you leave.\n\nYou have to constantly stop your travels to deal with the camps, and clearing them out isn't even a challenge, it's just boring; it does however make exploration feel like a slog, which is not a good thing in an open world game.\n\nAt one point I was exploring the wilderness during the night, far away from any camps, when all of a sudden a jeep came at me from nowhere and three guys started shooting at me. Not only is this frustrating but it's also immersion breaking, which is sad because the game really tries to provide an immersive experience. I liked that you have to use a physical map and that the camera stays first person during driving.\n\nIf the enemies would be less aggressive and they couldn't see you through foliage this game would be a lot more enjoyable.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ValkyrieIsland/recommended/19900/","ValkyrieIsland","ValkyrieIsland","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ValkyrieIsland/","314 products in account","1-3/2016 Original Review:\n\nPicture Dead Island.  Now, take away all the zombies, skill trees, interesting characters, and set the game in Africa.  Hey look, you've got Far Cry 2, a game with a meaningless protagonist who loves doing people's chores!  I get why people could enjoy this game, but I really didn't.  I have yet to finish the game and I'm dreading having to press on.  Here's some pros and cons to help you understand why:\n\nPros:\n-Absolutely beautiful atmosphere/map.  Looking out over a desert, lake, or bayou at sunset is amazing.\n-This game's multiplayer was my childhood, and the custom maps feature is awesome.  Playing escape maps with friends online holds some great memories for me.  Unfortunately, online play for this game is near dead now, but if you can get a chance to play some custom maps with friends they're fun.\n\nCons:  Oh god, where do I start.\n-Gameplay wise, get ready for some repetition.  Talk to an NPC, get a quest, drive to the other side of the damn map (or use the poorly implemented quick travel system), shoot people or blow something up, rinse & repeat.  It feels like a sin for a game with such a vast environment to feel so slow, dry, and outright boring.\n-This game is literally driving Simulator 2009 edition.  You have to drive so much, only to be interrupted halfway to your destination which feels 35253 miles away by some random mercenary who thought it'd be tactical to literally ram the hell into you.  This occurs WAY too often and gets extremely annoying.\n-The game is divided into two acts.  The problem with this, is by the end of act one the game feels like it's ready to end.  But it doesn't.  It goes into act two.  This literally made my jaw drop.  I was so ready to be done with this driving simulator.\n-If you're looking for a good story, don't come here.  In the beginning of the game, your character gets an idea in their mind of what they want to do.  Without spoiling anything, I'll say that at literally EVERY opportunity they get to carry out their objective, they're hindered physically (in pain, can't move, etc etc).  Total bs.  If this was the main goal of the game, I'd go to think they'd lift a finger a little more.  I think at the point in the game I'm currently at I can see why the protagonist might be changing their mind about killing the Jackal, but since our character doesn't talk we have no way of knowing their intentions.\n\nOverall if you're a fan of the Far Cry series give this a whirl.  Otherwise stay away, stay far away.\n\n5/10\n\n\n\n1-7/2016 UPDATE:\n\nI've been trying to finish this game, and oh has it been hard.  Not gameplay difficulty wise, but hard as in difficult to sit through this p.o.s...\n\nThis game is a perfect example of where a company threw the golden rule of games out the window: Gameplay over Graphics.  This game is gorgeous, but the gameplay is dry and repetative, not fun at all no matter how many different ways there are to approach missions.  This is because they're all the same exact thing, as I discussed in my older review above.\n\nThis game crashes constantly for me.  I was able to deal with this, up until now.  I have a few different save files that I've been making throughout the game just as a safety, and boy I'm glad I did.  I was at 88% game completion on my primary save, and I thought, I haven't saved in a while, I better save before end game!  Guess what?  I went to save, the game crashed, my heart sank.  "No," I thought to myself , "please don't let my save be corrupted."  Sure enough, it was.  Back to 73% game completion for me.  I get to do all those repetitious missions over again.  Woo-hoo.  I may add more comments when I do manage to finish this glitchy pile of crap.  But, until then, this is me signing out, advising you to not waste your time on this installment of the Far Cry franchise.\n\n\n\n1-7/2016 UPDATE 2 (Several hours later):\n\nWell, I did it.  I managed to finish the game.  I managed to combat losing my save progress by creating multiple new save files instead of overwriting the same one.\n\nThe ending of the game is o.k, but certainly not very good.  Before the ending, the game tries to make you feel as though your choices throughout the second half of the game meant something, but really it just decides slight aesthetic differences (who's present at the end, etc).  I'm in a love/hate relationship with the fact that  all of your friends that you helped throughout the game turn on you and betray you, and you have to in turn murder all of them.   It's a twist that attempts to show the true nature of the world you're in, but also makes little sense after all you've been through.\n\nEven the final choice in the game makes no difference whatsoever.  Choice is a complete illusion in this game, which is lame.  I went back to my save just before the final choice and tried the other option, the game ends exactly the same no matter which errand you decide to run.\n\nOverall, having finished the game, my opinion isn't very changed.  The ending doesn't redeem the poor gunplay.  It doesn't redeem the annoying as hell A.I. who shoot me on sight without good reason, and who ram my car with their every 5 minutes which made driving so unenjoyable.  The voice acting is shoddy and there's only one or two people who seem to have actually tried to sound convincing.  Neither of this people are the main antagonist, either.\n\nIt's just not a very good game.\nRemember Devs, Gameplay over Graphics.\n\nRevised score: 3/10\n\nP.S:  I hit uninstall on the game and the game opened.  What?","January 3","false","21.2"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","45","9","20","3","0"

And then I reflected on what a bizarre thing I had just done.  But for such a good-looking game, the fun seems to be hard to find.  I even considered that that might be the point; actually contracting malaria in a war-torn hellhole where you must kill or be killed wouldn't actually be much fun.\n\nThe game felt repetitive far too quickly for my tastes; you accept a quest from somebody, then drive from point A to point B (walking is far too slow.)  Along the way you'll likely pass two checkpoints on the road; no you can't avoid them by travelling off-road.   Each checkpoint has a few goons who would like to kill you, so you kill them.  Then you arrive at point B, where there are a few goons that would like to kill you, so you kill them.  Killing everyone at Point B usually accomplishes the quest goal, so now you must just return to point A, except that those damned checkpoints have already repopulated, so you need to murderdeathkill their residents over again just to get back.   The majority of the game, as I found it, was shooting my way through the same checkpoints over and over again.\n\nPart of the misery of the situation is that you will spend a certain amount of time trying to fight with crappy, unreliable firearms.  You will be able to purchase reliable guns that perform well at your safehouses, but for some reason you are unwilling to bring enough ammo for all the butchery that a typical quest demands, so at some point you will end up dropping your well-maintained and functional firearm in favour of a fallen foe's rusted-out jam-prone piece of scrap metal.  You will then have the joy of finishing the quest with this vaguely gun-like object, because continual weapon jams in difficult situations are an essential part of the experience.\n\nThat's my Far Cry 2 experience: repetitive, unrewarding shootouts, weapon jams, and malaria.  Subjectively, the experience is cohesive and thematic -- it feels as though the creators successfully realized their vision -- it just wasn't enjoyable to play.","January 10, 2015","false","3.0"," 8 of 18 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","8","18","2","2"

But I started by playing Far Cry 3 and enjoyed it so much I thought I might as well try it's predecessor. Not a good idea. Number two stinks.\nIt lacks almost everything that makes FC3 a great game. FC2 has a dull story line, and most missions are exact copies of earlier ones, especially the side missions. Example: to unlock weapons you have to blow up a convoy coming from the east. And then one from the west. And south. And yes, dealing with the convoy coming from the north is exactly the same; they drive around in circles, you blow the lorry to smithereens and you're done; you can proceed to the next mission. Public transport is the best choice to get there, as driving a car or boat takes about 10 times longer. That's because every 100 meters you have to deal with two homicidal maniacs in a car or ten of them at yet another road block.\nYou have a choice of nine to pick your main character from. It doesn't matter much which one you pick. Every character in the game has a personality as flat as roadkill at a monstertruck show.\nThe feeble attempt at a story line is hard to follow for someone who's not a native speaker, like me. Everyone speaks as if they've just done an ounce of speed, and even the subtitles have a hard time keeping up. From what I picked up, the story basically goes like this: first you work for this person, then you work for that person, then you work for another person, then you kill one of them and another person appears. You work for that person too, and then for another person and then you kill one of them and another person appears. Repeat until everyone dies. Game over.\n\nSo, no. I do not recommend buying this game, even though the graphics are pretty awesome for a game made in 2008.\nI do recommend Far Cry 3 though, which was fun, entertaining and trippy.\n\n\n","August 19, 2014","false","56.6"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","7","16","0","0"

For the whole duration of my playthrough I was either bored to death by the unnecessarily long drives and dull combat, or kept wondering how such a fundamentaly flawed game was released by a experienced company as Ubisoft.\n\nThe graphics are technically decent if compared to other games from when Far Cry 2 was released, but they did not age well. The map is huge but you can hardly tell any difference from the places you go apart from the 3 basic biomes (desert, savanna and jungle). Everything is bleached by a clear brown fog, even the jungles are a dull brownish color.  Almost every building on the map looks like it's part of a shanty town and the very few urban settings are minuscle and lame.\n\nSound is mostly mediocre, with a few very annoying sounds playing all the time like some metal banging from the regular cars, or a weird tire screeching sound that's played every other time you get shot (!). The few musics are unremarkable at best. The voice-over dialogues are terrible, the actors seem to have been rushed into reading their lines as fast as possible.\n\nThe story is terrible and almost non-existent, wasting an excelent opportunity to delve deep in such an important and completely overlooked theme that are the civil wars happening in Africa. The player character is despicable and so are almost everyone you get to interact with throughout the game and you suspension of disbelief is constantly broken by the lack of sense on the assignments given to your character. In a few moments the game seems to give options to the player, but soon after you learn that your choices mean nothing and the story follows it's pre defined path.\n\nBut the worst of all is the gameplay. 70% of the time spent playing Far Cry 2 involves driving, a few times even walking large distances devoid of anything but the infamous ever respawning enemy guard posts present at every other road crossing. The main missions are very repetitive and are limited to driving to a certain spot, killing someone/taking or giving an item/destroying something and then going somewhere else to repeat this pattern until the mission is completed. The side missions are utterly repetitive and often send you all the way across the map. And to add insult to injury, every now and then you need to drop everything you are doing to go fetch some malarial pills, which is probably one of the dumbest repeteable side quest ever on the history of videogames.\n\nBottom line is, if you have money to spend on a game, there are many other better options on Steam, so do yourself a favour and skip this one.","February 18","false","23.9"," 7 of 16 people (44%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","44","7","16","2","3"

Weapons feel like they have almost no effect unless you get headshots, missions are extremely repetitive, the lack of  a HUD itself is not a problem but making the in-game map extremely screen covering and at the same tie making you have it out to use the telescope for recon makes it a huge pain to scout out gaurd posts due to not being able to see ♥♥♥♥. Stealth does virtually nothing and even if you manage to stealth kill one guy the whole base swarms you immediatly afterwards. The map has nothing interesting in it and enemies are all virtually identical, resulting in exploration being boring and tedious. There is a lack of any rel progression outside of unlocking new weapons, but with a few exceptions they are all slight varitations of the basic assault rifle, shotgun, pistol, and sniper rifle famillies. The malaria management is a pain in the ♥♥♥ and adds nothing but annoyance.\nThere are some good things like the buddy system and fire mechanics but aside from a few good points, the game is largely disapointing.","October 5, 2014","false","5.4"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

Basically, thanks to this game, I got interested in PC gaming.\nIt gave me plenty of memories and even emotions.\nHowever, now, in 2015, as I started to play this game again, something was wrong.\nEven though it run on ultra settings, it looked quiet bad. And I'm not talking about that it looks bad because it's old.\nNo. It's way too dark, even in sunlight, the blur gives you eye cancer, shadows are lagging, apart from some crates and other stuff everything is solid and the models change their LOD as you approach them. This was the most frustrating issue from all.\nNow let's talk about the actual gameplay.\nIt's even worse.\nI downloaded a Realism Mod, which meant to change on the "shoot 20 bullets into his chest then finally he'll die" situation, and on many oher terrible mistakes. It was still rubbish.\nYou may have heard of the respawning enemies AFTER you liberate a checkpoint. It is utterly stupid, and I'd put the person who programmed this into this situation in real life. In short, I'm talking about this:\nYou drive peacefully on the dusty road, when suddenly, there is a small checkpoint of the local military. They immediately start to shoot at you, without a question. When you killed them all, and occupied it, you drive along. After like 30m, you remember, that you forgot to pick up ammo, so you turn back. What a suprise, there are soldiers again!! And this goes on and on, every 40 something small base works the same. They even chase you if you drive through them.\nAnyways, back to the rewiev.\nYou can't pick up multiple missions, since the new one would abort the current. How hard could it be to make it possible, and let the player switch between them?\nThe narration and voices are terrible. They are monotone, and world-weary.\nThe game doesn't give you the option to play stealthy. I killed a guard pretty far from the others while crouching, with my machete - stealth kill, as it's called nowdays. Guess what. The others miraculously figured out where I am in the 70cm high grass, and opened fire. There is an expensive body armor called "Camo Suit" which grants more invisibility. I read, it doesn't work either.\nThe story is lame as well.\n\nI really hoped, that it'll bring back the good memories, but sadly it couldn't.\nEverybody said it was a bad game and I didn't believe them. Now I do.\n\nGo buy Far Cry 3 or 4, those are masterpieces compared to this.","April 28, 2015","false","4.0"," 6 of 14 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","6","14","0","0"

The "story" is so convoluted and weak, you'll stop caring or paying attention in no time.\n\nYes, the combat system is OK, and the driving isn't the worst- but that's where the positives end. This game is so repetitive, it feels like you're doing the exact same mission over and over again. Every mission starts with the same voice giving the same instructions. The "pay" rarely varies. Stealth is nearly useless, as your enemies will spot you 200 yards away, crouched in the weeds... and of course they'll hit you with every shot, despite their supposedly inferior weapons. The graphics are pretty bland (even for 2008) without a mod installed.\n\nOverall, if you're into getting achievements (like find all the diamonds, etc) and just like to hunt and gather, you MIGHT like it. But there are no boss fights; side missions and main missions look and feel the same, and the upgrade system isn't very rewarding.\n\nIf you have a lot of time to kill and can get it for $5, then maybe... otherwise, you'd be much better off with any of the Red Faction or Borderlands games.

Given the recent trend of reviewers re-examining it and declaring it some sort of misunderstood masterpiece I decided to buy it again (I'd lost my disk ages back) and give it another go. As I remembered it mostly consists of driving a vehicle backwards and forwards around the same parts of the map with the same 3-4 annoying AI troops respawning in the exact same areas and attacking you. If killed they'll simply respawn in their checkpoint ready to chase you next time and ignoring them simply results in them following you forever.\n\nDegradation is a nice idea but once your weapons have degraded you have to DRIVE BACK to the arms dealer again since picking up extra weapons from dead enemies is worthless (they are always in horrible condition). To even get weapons in the armoury you have to:\n\nA. Do a side mission to unlock the weapons for purchase (more driving to get there and back).\nB. Find diamonds to pay for the weapons (even more ♥♥♥♥ing driving).\n\nYou do get small moments of fun now and then. Stealth, for example, sometimes works brilliantly but just as often the AI decides to spot me at random and then everyone in the area will magically know your position. I've got nothing against harder stealth but STALKER did it better even with its flaws. Some of the missions are fun too but most are fairly forgettable firefights.\n\nThe game would likely have worked much better as a series of linear missions with a semi-open map for each (i.e. Far Cry 1). As usual open world here just means repetitive and empty.\n\nBuddy mechanics and the general atmosphere are the only good points but all the atmosphere in the world couldn't make up for the complete boredom of actually playing this game.\n\nFinally to add insult to injury the game is buggy as ♥♥♥♥, particularly the tutorial. Activating the DLC is an annoyance also. You might have to spend 1-2 hours hunting for fixes and replaying the unskippable intro/tutorial until it works (10+ minutes every time). As mentioned above the AI also varies between being completely blind and cheating depending largely on their alert status.","April 13, 2015","false","9.9"," 5 of 12 people (42%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","42","5","12","2","0"

That was great.  You were in a big ol' open world, and you could find these shots that gave you animalistic super powers like leaping and attacking.  You took shots and they made you like unto a God.\n\nFar Cry 2 is similar, except now when you take shots they are anti-malarial shots, and the awesome benefit they provide is that as long as you can find them and take them you don't die! So awesome! I love driving around the map, fighting off the stupid AI and searching around for green vials that let me play the game awhile longer.  It's like playing an old arcade game, except instead of running out of quarters, your character just runs out of the will to live.\n\nIt's really my own fault though, I mean Far Cry 1 had super powers, and I just assumed Far Cry 2 would as well, or at least maybe not a constant life threatening illness.\n\nLet's forget the maleria for a second, even though the game never does, is the rest of the game good? No.\n\nHere's, honestly, my biggest gripe... ok, second biggest after the lack of super powers as given in the first game... ok, third biggest after they took away those powers and gave you a debilitating illness... So, my third biggest gripe is just how boring this game is, namely, how long it takes to get anywhere.  They gloat about this giant island that you get to sandbox around in, however it seems that half of it is covered by impassable mountains.  You want to go someplace literally two inches away on the map? Have fun driving around the mountains for ten minutes to get there.

It looks great, plays great, and has good voice acting.  However driving around everywhere for fetch quests in an open world does not yeild properly in this game.  Basically every quarter mile driving is a check point with arm guards who also have machine gun turrets.  So 80% of this game is driving between fetch quests destinations in an open world with the constant annoyance of arm guard check points.  Three hours into it and I found myself no longer wanting to drive anywhere since I had seen 30 mins of action and 2.5 hours of driving in the desert.  - Looks great, plays great, but you really need to enjoy driving.

This game is a open world game in Africa, which has some pretty good exploration in some parts while having a lot of dull flat desert with nothing to do. This game also makes you work for every little thing. Everytime your car gets damaged, you have to get out and take a good 10-15 seconds to manually fix it. ALthough the bus travel is helpful, there is still a lot of dull going from point A to point B in this game. And the worst part of it is the outposts. There are a ton of outposts scattered around the map with a good 5-15 enemies at each one. This wouldn't be bad if they didn't respawn after you lost sight of it. So every trip you go (unless you wanna walk which obviously takes way too long) you have to deal with 2 or 3 of these camps.. both ways. The story (although you get to choose which side you are on) is really repetitive, whichever path you choose. "GO kill this guy, or this camp" not to mention several side missions you have to do to get malaria medicine. Oh yeah you get malaria in the beginning. Oh and guns jam.\n\nThe good in this game though includes the diamond collecting system, the variety of weapons and vehicles but not much else, you are better off getting far cry 3 (or even 1)\n\n\nTL:DR: The game is an okay shooter, but i gets old fast and has a ton of annoying tidbits: respawing camps, jamming guns, and manual vehicle fixing.","December 31, 2014","false","9.4"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","3"

I would not recommend it. The entire time I was playing, I was praying for it to be over so I could move on to trying Far Cry 3 (which I finished a little over an hour ago).\n\nLemme list some grievances with FC2.\n\n1. It's an open world game and there's no fast travel or quick means of travelling except for bus stations in opposite corners of the map. You have to drive miles upon miles, having to stop every half mile because there's enemies every half mile that you have to stop to kill. Even if you drive past them, you'll still have to stop to fix your car and they'll probably get in an armed jeep and chase you anyway. You have no idea how tedious that got. I swear half my play time (28 hours as opposed to FC3's 18 hours) came from driving to mission locations.\n\n2. The enemies every half mile respawn, so you have no hope of ever escaping having to constantly stop - nor is there any motivation to engage them (save for the ones that chase you in vehicles that you HAVE to get out and kill).\n\n3. Weapons wear down. While this was an interesting concept, the weapons wear down way too quickly. They go from brand new to exploding in your hand in like a day.\n\n4. Everything is too grayish or brownish. The game made me feel like I was colorblind sometimes.\n\n5. For some reason your character doesn't talk in FC2 even though your character talks in FC1 and FC3.\n\n6. There wasn't much story to be had, relatively speaking.\n\n7. The game would give you choices here and there that wouldn't make any difference. The same cutscenes would still play either way.\n\nAnyone thinking of getting FC2, do yourself a favor and skip over to FC3.","January 13, 2015","false","29.0"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","1"

Characterization was endangered if almost non-existant and events unfolded for the sake of formality it would seem. Things seemed to happen just cause.Other things seemed to happen just so there would be an excuse for another thing to happen without any true relevance to the plot or character development.\nThe potential for the story,as I've said,is depressingly wasted,unexplored and unexpounded despite innumerable opportunities.Generic guards and soldiers disabled any potential for flavor in this so-called civil war.Similarly,the missions were repetitive regardess of who you side with in the game.Any difference is purely aesthetic in nature.The most I could get in major difference were tiny morsels of gossip about the faction's background and the war itself.There was no true point in choosing a side in the world's factions.\nFurthermore,events that would seem major to me would happen suddenly without any rising action,falling action or any form of hype whatsoever.Couple this with repetitive gameplay and mission objectives and you end up with dull,wasted surprises for the player.\nI want to emphasize the lack of characterization among nearly all characters.They would either just do as they would be told despite being major characters or they would suddenly commit acts that would seem weighty if not for the lack of hype around it.The only thing separating them from the random mooks was the unique character models and the names.I could find more autonomy in a ballpen.Events were almost always too sudden for me to appreciate the deep potential in the story.\nAll in all,it was a pain for me to play this game.Every hour spent on this game was agonizingly dull and every tidbit of potential in the story I could find was like a droplet of water to a weary desert traveler.Never before has "get it over with" been my objective to play a video game.And again,my main issue was the poor narrative and the unexpounded story.If not for that,then all else could be forgiven.\nDespite the negativity in my review,there are 3 aspects that I enjoyed.\n~I loved the ability to choose a player character.\n~The buddy system allowed variety.If ever I (somehow) get the urge to play this again,it would be because of this.\n~The reputation system and how it affected the AI in relation to a firefight with you.\nThe buddy system offers some tint of retribution and the African Landscape is beautiful if lonely and littered with the occasional random dead body.\nThank you and have a nice day :)","September 19, 2015","false","27.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

I immediately change the graphics options from the default of minimal to settings my computer can easily run.  Then I made the mistake of telling it to run on DX10 instead of DX9.  The game immediately crashed and when I tried to load it, all I could see were fragments.  I could not even tell where my cursor was, let alone change back to DX9.  When I tried to update the GamerProfile to DX9, it didn't help.\n\nUninstall, reinstall.  Only the game wouldn't let me uninstall.  Every time I exit out of FC2 Steam says it's still running despite my Task Manager being clear of all game related tasks.  Force close Steam.  Open Steam.  Uninstall.  Reinstall. Oh and get this, when I go to delete local content through Steam, it launches the game.  When I close the game again, then the content is gone.\n\nThat worked and I was able to get into the game and NOT click on DX10.\n\nThen I started a new game.  Graphic issues all over the place.  Water changing color rapidly, NPCs bouncing up and down all over the place, I can see a guy's teeth flicking over his face.  No matter how I changed the graphics options, the problems persist.  Online forums were no help either, just a bunch of people like me complaining.  Also seems like those who contacted Ubi didn't get much resolution to the issue either.  Yes I know what you're going to say, "What are your sys specs and is everything updated?"  My system is incredible and everything is updated, no hardware issues.  I'm a super nerd.  Yes I even verified the cache and everything Steam suggests. Yes the game is updated too.\n\nNow we come to gameplay.  This is stuff I'm not sure is bug related but may just be terrible production.  NPC talk faster than I can think.  I have subtitles on and I can barely pass my eyes over all the words before they leave the screen, let alone read them.  Vehicles have fewer hitpoints than a human.  Speaking of which, shouldn't people be dead after a burst of rifle fire to center mass?  They should, at the very least, not get back up and shoot at me.  Oh and I almost forgot, I had to delete my first game and restart the campaign because I took medicine from the kit on the wall before saving and it wouldn't let me proceed since my health was full.  Had to watch that crazy long intro that you can't skip all over again (I took the time to make some food). Half the time, I couldn't accept or complete missions because the NPC's would repeat dialogue over and over again and I couldn't interact with them or items near them (this one is definitely a bug but it impacted the gameplay more than anything).  The last thing that pulled the plug for me was that EVERY TIME you come to an intersection, enemies respawn.\n\nAfter 2 hours of playing with this I'm done.  Forever.  People who paid full price for this and have similar issues got robbed.\n\nUbi, the only thing that's saving you is Assassin's Creed.","June 19, 2014","false","3.0"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

It's so repetitive and surprisingly dull in terms of story. "go to this place, kill this guy"..."go to this place, blow this up"... WOW. The visuals alone are just not worth it. Also, even on hardest difficulty this game is too easy. Despite having to unlock various "safehouses" to save your game along the way, the PC port offers you unlimited quicksaves at any point during the game, which is hilarious and takes away any kind of stress from the game.\n\nIt's beautiful, but it's repetetive and dull with stupid A.I - but stupid A.I that seem to have wall-hacks because as soon as they spot you that's it, they know exactly where you are and where you're going to pop your head out - even if it's night time and you've bought camo (pointless upgrade) and you run a mile around a camp and sneak back in they know exactly where you are.\n\nBuy it if it's on sale (I got it in a sale bundle with Far Cry 3) then sure, go for it if it's a bargain but it's not worth the full price.","August 11, 2014","false","27.6"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

For me these things only adds to the immersion, it's more brutal that way but for a lot of players not having those indicators would leave them feeling frustrated or that the game is broken.\n\nThere's no minimap, you need to get the map out from your pocket to have a look, once again for some people this only adds to immersion but to others it's just awkward, I guess it just depends on the type of player you are.\n\nThe biggest flaws with FarCry2 are the fact it's an open World 1st person shooting game that fails to deliver a decent open World to explore and at the same time having sloppy weapon mechanics and for those 2 reasons I wouldn't recommend FarCry2.\n\nI've spent over 30 hours with FarCry2 on the PC and there's aspects of the game I really liked.\nVisually I find it very pleasing, the setting and atmosphere are rather nice.\nThe fire mechanics I feel are the best in the series and creating mass scale fires to clear out check points never got old.\nPlant physics, so they move when you touch or drive over them and branches will drop down if you shoot though them.\nThe vehicles although extremely bland to drive with awful sound effects have had some nice little touches added, they get dirty when driven in the jungle and the level of destruction is greater than that in FarCry3 in terms of your car falling apart, lights being smashed, bumpers or bonnets flying off.\n\nBut in the end FarCry2 feels empty, the map is lifeless and barren. There's no civilians who live there, it's pretty much you and everyone else is your enemy. The check points you clear and even other locations will have guards re-spawning, so it's this never ending army and it's not even that they  re-spawn hours later, they do it with in a couple of minutes and it feels cheap and breaks the immersion.\n\nThe auto-save system doesn't work very well, you often have to go back an hour in to game after you die. There is the option to press F5 and do a quick save, which is great if you remember to do it every 10 minutes but you're meant to be immersed in the game, not thinking about saving.\n\nAn open World game should entice you to explore and FarCry2 doesn't. A 1st person shooting game should have solid gun mechanics and FarCry2 doesn't.\n\nFarCry2 has a nice physics engine, it's an enjoyable African grassland fire simulator but that's sadly all it has to offer.","January 2, 2015","false","31.5"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/andyw_uk/recommended/19900/","andyw_uk","AndyW_UK","http://steamcommunity.com/id/andyw_uk/","160 products in account","I have come into Far Cry 2 from the unusual perspective of having finished Far Cry 3 recently beforehand, and I have been extremely disappointed by FC2 so far. It's clear to see where Ubisoft have made improvements in FC3 that ruined its predecessor.\n\nThe game's setting and feel is great; it really captures the feeling of a central African country. But that's where the good ends, unfortunately.\n\nMy first gripe was the impossibly good AI that can shoot me through undergrowth from 300m away with no problem, and outposts full of guards that instantly turn all their fire on you with unerring accuracy the moment you try and snipe someone. FC3 handled this much better with panicking pirates that fire wildly in your general direction when you snipe them and have far more realistic (i.e. worse) awareness, accuracy and line of sight. I accept that I'm not especially good at FPS games in general, but I find this game punishingly hard, even taking that into account.\n\nEnemies are also extremely bullet-spongy, which is disappointing from a game touting some degree of authenticity and realism in its setting. Even the most basic African militia or mercenary seems to be wearing a kevlar t-shirt and takes about 10 rounds of 5.56mm to the chest to die.\n\nNext is the crazy respawn rate of enemies. There are times where I've cleared out a guardpost, only to find the enemies shooting at me again from it once I'm barely 100m down the road. I can only assume this wasn't playtested by QA at Ubisoft.\n\nWithin the first hour these critical game design flaws had killed the game for me. Although I was able to find the useful "Dylan's Realism Mod" to reduce the enemy HP and awareness slightly, it still didn't get rid of the incessant enemy respawns that lead to a lack of permanence and meaning in your actions.\n\nFar Cry 3 did everything better except vehicles, which in FC2 actually handle like, well, vehicles; as opposed to FC3, where vehicles are made from rubber and roads lined with goose fat.\n\nOverall though, Far Cry 3 highlights what a wasted opportunity Far Cry 2 was - get FC3 instead.","January 24, 2014","false","33.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

You have to spend your time driving in an ugly environment for hours, getting shot repeatedly by enemies who can drive at mach 5 while you're locked to a cruising speed. You have to tend to your malaria (I'm not kidding) which is hard because medicine is scarce. Enemies can see you 600 meters out and instantly assume you're an enemy and ruin your stealth approach.

A vast open world was certainly exciting at the time of release, but once you find yourself covering ridiculous amounts of ground, wiping out an entire camp of enemies only to find they have miraculously respawned when you drive past again five minutes later, it gets boring fast.\n\nI found the driving frustrating, especially with the frequent stops at the aforementioned camps, and the game's handheld map - whilst an interesting idea - obscures the screen and interrupts the game in a way I didn't care for.\n\nOne saving grace of the game is the shooting.  It's very satisfying, the guns have a sense of weight and recoil.  They also jam often, until you get better weaponry, which is a nice touch of realism and serves as something of a progression system.\n\nThere are also a few things that this game brought to the table, such as environmental damage.  The way fire spreads through the grass is quite impressive.\n\nAll in all I can't recommend this.  There are so many games of this kind that provide a better experience.","January 6, 2014","false","5.4"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

So if you are in the bottom left corner to accept a mission, expect to go back way to the top of the map.\n\nUnlike FC3 when you liberate a post, it is not the scenario here. There is always bad guys. You can't get from point A to B quickly and quietly, unless you go offroad, and even then, it takes longer.\n\nWhen you come into the game, I was not exactly sure what my objectives were. I had to go on the internet to give myself an idea. It was later after wasting time with side missions that don't really matter (Radio Tower missions) that I eventually learned that I have to get missions from the town and buddies (not real people or your online friends) that you encounter during the game.\n\nThen it started getting interesting. But still the fact that fast travel is not great and posts are always fill with bad guys, makes it redundant and a bit frustrating.\n\nNow I am not saying the game sucks. I am saying my mistake is that I was thinking of FC3 benefits and how I wished FS2 had it. I am even more sure that if I played them in order, I would be enjoying FC2 a lot better than I am now\n\nGiven that. I do not fault the game. It is what it is and I am sure that anyone playing it will have a lot of fun.\n\nBut don't do my mistake.

So if you are in the bottom left corner to accept a mission, expect to go back way to the top of the map.\n\nUnlike FC3 when you liberate a post, it is not the scenario here. There is always bad guys. You can't get from point A to B quickly and quietly, unless you go offroad, and even then, it takes longer.\n\nWhen you come into the game, I was not exactly sure what my objectives were. I had to go on the internet to give myself an idea. It was later after wasting time with side missions that don't really matter (Radio Tower missions) that I eventually learned that I have to get missions from the town and buddies (not real people or your online friends) that you encounter during the game.\n\nThen it started getting interesting. But still the fact that fast travel is not great and posts are always fill with bad guys, makes it redundant and a bit frustrating.\n\nNow I am not saying the game sucks. I am saying my mistake is that I was thinking of FC3 benefits and how I wished FS2 had it. I am even more sure that if I played them in order, I would be enjoying FC2 a lot better than I am now\n\nGiven that. I do not fault the game. It is what it is and I am sure that anyone playing it will have a lot of fun.\n\nBut don't do my mistake. Play FarCry 2 before you play FarCry 3.","August 17, 2015","true","51.1"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","0"

Instead it is extremely frustrating game with predictable storyline, which gives the player almost no ways to affect how the story is going to proceed.\n\nFull Review:\nFirst I would like to talk about the gameplay, which is very frustrating as I said. Most of the missions the player takes part are relatively identical to each other and are somewhat booring. This especially apllies to missions required to make new guns available. The worst part of this game though are the transitions between the missions. To travel to location of you mission you have to travel trough large amount of roadblocks that are guarded by hostile militia. Clearing these places is very repetitive. You have to keep clearing these roadblocks troughout the game. Even if you had just passed them there are new soldiers there to wait for you return.\n\nYou can't even enjoy driving your car because these roadblocks are so close to each other that you would almost be faster on foot. On high difficulty levels these roadblocks are actually quite difficult to clear, which increases the frustration even higher. If this isn't enough there is more. Sometimes those militas appear behind your car in their own vehicle and eliminate you with just few bullets before you can do anything. Additionally those militias suck incredible amounts of bullets before they die. To summarise. most of the time you are not really playing the game but instead clearing the extremely annoying and repetitive roadblocks.\n\nNext about the Storyline. As I said the storyline is very predictable as I said. I wish I could say more but I would spoil the plot. What is possibly even worse is that although the player is allowed to make choices during the campaign, these choices result in identical or almost identical outcome.\n\nNext the multiplayer:\nI barely touched the multiplayer so i can't give much insight into it, but from the brief time I tested it, the multiplayer part seemed like a very generic FPS game.","November 26, 2013","false","31.3"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","3","9","0","0"

There are many good ideas that were very badly executed. The game feels rushed in terms of missions and gaming environment: It is just no fun anymore to run around after an hour or two, since the environment is plainly boring and the travelling system annoying. The missions and tasks repeat over and over with only little variations.\nEven the combat system is only limited fun: Thanks to the "Fortune's Edition" content you already start off overpowered, since your armory already contains badass weapons, which makes gathering other weapons less fun. Guns wearing off is a neat idea, but they seem to be made out of tin, since they always break after about 50~100 shots. Add bad guys chasing you down on every corner and you can guess that you cannot get very far without having to change your weapons like socks. So, you will end up using your vehicle's cannon, since the law of crappiness doesn't aply to them.\nGraphics look qute neat on the other side, even though the environment has quite a bunch of graphic bugs hidden here and there, like floating trees or walls that are magic mirros. Generally bugs are quite a huge problem of this game: Even in the intro video, where I couldn't do anything besides looking around, there were bugs already, like people sinking into the ground to their knees and bobbing up and down. After 7h of playing I already had 3 bugs that broke my missions and then I thought: "Ok, that's it. I should have saved my 2,50€ and bought a pound of minced meat instead." - And so should you!","December 4, 2013","false","7.6"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

Story is okay, but predictable.\nFarcry 3 is a much better game because of its awesome story, but this one isn't bad.","December 16, 2013","true","0.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Combined with annoyingly long road trips between action, there's not much upside to keep me coming back to finish the campaign even once.","November 26, 2013","false","7.7"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

The Open World is indeed open world, but all you find are more people that want to kill you. There is absolutely no suprise when you run into a Non-Important town and they all attack you.\n\nThe weapon variety is nice, but most of the weapons are about useless when you are bombarded by snipers and mortars. There is no reason to not use a sniper rifle which reigns supreme in all situations.\n\nThe environment interaction is a novelty at best. If you are caught in fire it DESTROYS you, but the enemy sits down and lights a cigarette then jerks off when they are covered in flames all at the same time they are shooting at you.\n\nI played it simply because it was the next in the series. I played for about 5 hours and disliked this game. I forced myself to beat it because I'm stubborn and it took about 23.\n\nEnding sucks, skip this game.","July 14, 2015","false","23.2"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","0","3","0","0"

But not long as in filled with stuff, just takes forever to get anywhere and do anything. 80% of the time spent on any mission is just GETTING to the mission site.\n\nAnd the ending is feh. Happy in a way. Sort of. But Feh regardless.","June 10, 2011","false","39.4"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

And it is very good at that, for better or for worse.\n\nAnd from what I've experienced of it, it's for worse.  The constantly-jamming weapons, the fact that everyone's trying to kill you no matter who you align yourself with, a map interface that's clunky at best, and the malaria...oh, god, the malaria.  You have to take malaria pills every half-hour in-game, or you die.  And you only get four doses at a time - you replenish your pills at one specific in-game location.  It's all very frustrating, and all in the name of "a realistic experience."\n\nLet Far Cry 2 remain as an example of how realism doesn't always make a game better.","May 15, 2014","false","10.3"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"
