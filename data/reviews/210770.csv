For those who played the original changes include enemies that actively attack you if you get too close, walls are now low enough for towers to be able to shoot across multiple rows and also make it harder for you to avoid attacks. Most towers are air and ground now. Weapons are now split into classes, and you can only carry four tower types so as to encourage team-work.\nFor new players and beginners, if you enjoy FPS combat and Tower Defense, then this is a great fusion of the two. Balance is perfect between towers and player weapons so as to ensure contribution from both. You also have the option of inviting three other friends for a chaotic good time of setting up towers and shooting monsters in the face.\n","July 2, 2013","true","25.6"," 89 of 102 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","89","102","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/recommended/210770/","midnightwolfie","MidnightWolfie","http://steamcommunity.com/id/midnightwolfie/","597 products in account","Hello Ladies and Gentlemen!\nToday I will write a review about a first person tower defense game called Sanctum 2.\n\nA bit about the game and developers.\nSanctum 2 is a sequel to a quite famous first person tower defense game called Sanctum. Both games have been developed and published by a well known company called Coffee Stain Studios. They stand behind many well known titles. The most recent one is Goat Simulator. Yes, they made Goat Simulator.\n\nAbout Gameplay.\nSanctum 2 is a first person shooter game in which the player has the ability to make a tower maze that will help him defend the core from a lot of numerous enemies. There are a lot of different weapons, towers and enemies in Sanctum 2, every one of them having different strengths and weaknesses. And to be able to experience the game fully, the player should have full party of people with each of them having a different character. I feel the question "why?" coming up next, so I'll just answer it to you now. Each character has his / her own weapon. One has shotgun, one has sniper, one has rocket launcher, one riffle and the newest character has a crossbow. Shotgun character is good against bigger enemies that come running at him. Rocket launcher is good versus swarms of enemies since his damage does not only go on one enemy. Sniper and Crossbow characters are best versus game bosses, since they deal largest amount of damage in one hit. And riffle is good versus pretty much anything, but of course it has smallest damage rate.\n\nEach character can have a secondary weapon. There are many various secondary weapons so the player can fit exactly what they want to fit. There are also different perks in this game, so even those help out. So you could even turn slow, but powerful weapons into very fast, even more powerful weapons. Of course, there are many towers that help you in your victory. There are those towers that are fast, but deal small amount of damage, and then there are those that are slow and yet deal massive amount of damage. Each tower is good for something, and it's up to player to find out what is the best way to make the towers fit in with their game style. There are also a lot of different types of enemies. Some are small, numerous and fast, while others are big, slow and hard to kill.\n\nUnlike the first game, Sanctum 2 feels a bit more open. It feels like you have more space to move, more space to build and more possibilities. On the other hand, this game also introduced leveling system. Each level unlocks different weapons, perks or towers to the player. Leveling is quite easy at start, but that changes later on. And the leveling system actually gives a replay value to the game, since you can always come back to old maps and redo them with your newly unlocked weapons, towers and perks.\n\nUnlike in many other games, DLC's in this game are actually quite good. I am not a fan of DLC's in general so I still think that they are overpriced, but for the amount of money you put into them you get quite a few things back. With the DLC's you get tones of new maps, new characters and quite a few weapons. So the Complete Collection is a pure go from my end.\n\nGraphic and Audio.\nHonestly, I was a bit disappointed by the graphic. It does look prettier and there are more details than in the first one, but I just feel like there's many more things that the developers could do to make the game prettier. Audio on the other hand is amazing, and I just enjoyed listening to every song or background sound that the developers put into the game.\n\nPros, cons and final grade.\nPros:\n- Many different maps.\n- Characters to chose from.\n- DLC's that give an actual new content.\n- Various different unlockables.\n\nCons:\n- No ability to change primary weapon until final level.\n- Sometimes towers feel useless.\n\nFinal Grade: 7.5/10\n\nExtra info: If you are a fan of first person shooters, or maybe tower defense games, then this game is for you. You just can't go wrong with Sanctum 2. You can buy Sanctum 2 over Steam.\n\nIn case you like my reviews, please head over to my blog and read the other reviews\nhttp://midnightwolfie.blogspot.com\n\nThank you very much!","April 23, 2014","true","6.6"," 166 of 215 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","166","215","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoffeeStainSlave/recommended/210770/","CoffeeStainSlave","Curly Brace","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CoffeeStainSlave/","68 products in account","A great game, in my opinion. The design and concept are lovely, and I always enjoy smaller game companies. I used to adore tower defense games in my earlier years, but after I discovered Steam, I started to drift away from the tower defense games I'd play online. I started to play more FPS-Type games such as Gmod, Half-Life 2, and TF2. One day I closed a steam game, and was greeted with the exciting sight of a steam news window. Scrolling through it, I came across a "newly released" page featuring Sanctum 2. All I remember was that the picture had Skye on it, and I thought "Oh, this is interesting character design. I'll check this out." (Yes, I'm a sucker for gingers.) So I watched the trailer, then eagerly waited for the demo to download. I bought the full game shortly after clearing the demo, and I was not disappointed.\n\nA note for those with less-than-behemoth GPU's, since the creators don't have a huge amount of resources availible, they don't have all that much spare time for graphical optimization, so it may get a bit choppy with the higher settings.\n\n\nTL;DR: Cute gingers, strong female characters, perfect genre (For me, at least.) And shiny art style. 11/10 would buy again.\n\nA bit of an edit: No, this isn't a full serious review, there's a lot more that I didn't add, such as  the great loadout system, fun enemy types, and how the devs are really responsive to the community.\n\nAnd of course, most importantly, there is a difference between gingers and redheads. Lyralei can confirm this.","November 25, 2013","true","106.4"," 178 of 236 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","178","236","0","2"

It's by far one of the hardest games I've played. The challenge is nice for a change.\n\nThe game is multiplayer-centric and co-op is set to "public" by default. It was a bit of a shock the first time someone randomly entered my game, but he was very helpful and we won. The community is very sporting, not a lot of finger pointing when a game is lost. Having a different team each time you play keeps it interesting.\n\nIn Sanctum 1, the FPS element served to supplement the TD element and it was often possible to win without firing a shot. In Sanctum 2, both elements are vital and you must be good at both to survive. The separation between tower bases and towers means your options for pathing are much more limited in the beginning than in S1. Moreover, the FPS has been made much harder than it was as the enemies now fight back and your character can be killed (knocked out for ten seconds).\n\nOverall, Sanctum 2 is one of the best games of the century.","January 11, 2015","true","96.8"," 45 of 49 people (92%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","92","45","49","4","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/toquina/recommended/210770/","toquina","Overkill_Ashley♥","http://steamcommunity.com/id/toquina/","302 products in account","The first Sanctum was a first person tower defense game, with first person shooting aspects added to help give the players something to do during waves instead of simply watching your towers do all the work. It was a somewhat new concept in how well the tower balancing was executed while giving almost limitless designs and combinations. The drawbacks were simply trademarks of it being a new Indy title, a simple lack of content for missions and poor textures clearly showed the limitations of the budget and time they were working with. The first person shooting elements needed much more work to be entertaining in the long run however the game’s much heavier focus on the tower building distracted enough from this flaw that the game remained fresh with each new layout you created.\n\nWith the release of Sanctum 2, I was looking forwards to an updated version of the first giving more customization, towers, maps and maybe a few thrilling scripted events during the campaign missions. As I launched the game for the first time, ignoring the many technical errors of the initial release and completed the tutorial I started my first mission. As expected the graphics were considerably improved as they took on a more comic based look, similar to the art design of borderlands 2, although it has been done before it definitely gives sanctum 2 a much more unique appearance. The new addition of a progression system allows players to level up to unlock perks, new weapons and towers that rewards players who play on harder difficulty settings with a shorter grind.\n\nOnce I decided to get started building I suddenly realized I was only allowed to build seven blocks of wall, which meant I had to obey the map design when creating my maze for the enemies to pass through. This immediately felt very limiting, as one of the great aspects of the first is that it allowed you to create as many walls as you desired, and simply expecting you to create your own design within the map layout. With a limited number of wall blocks, the game forces you to take the basic route that the map often implies for you to take making it feel like I had little choice at all when it came to the design, just simply having to do what everyone else does within the same map. Speaking to my co-op partner on skype I found myself frequently saying, “I could do this amazing layout.. oh I don’t have enough blocks I guess this will have to do.” Constantly leaving missions with a feeling that it could have been better, and wasn’t complete, one of the worst feelings possible within a tower defense game. I decided to play a survival mission to get around this issue, where each wave I would be given more blocks. I would be able to finally create the layout I wanted, however I soon found myself no longer being given wall blocks after the first few waves, leaving me to keep the same incomplete design for the never ending survival mode.\n\nAfter my second to third mission I started to notice in the end game statistics that I was dealing considerably more damage then all of my towers each game. With the new design you will notice a much stronger focus on the first person shooting then the tower defense, with many levels not even requiring the use of towers providing the use of the right equipment. The stronger focus on shooting would expect dramatic improvements to the design of shooting compared to the first game, however this is simply not the case and some elements of the weapons have been removed. You are no longer able to spend resources on your weapons to improve their performance as possible within the first game. A bigger selection of weapons allows you to focus on certain strengths or help cover flaws that your character choice may have. With the addition one weapon slot being fixed depending on your character choice, you only have access to change your secondary weapon. With such a strong focus on the shooting elements, it leave me to question why they forced this to be so limited during missions. It soon becomes a boring chore to shoot during waves, especially when weapons empty their clips so quickly and then demand a five second cooldown time to reload.\n\nWithin the game mechanics of Sanctum 2 the placement of a single block can often decide the success or failure of a wave on specific maps. Some maps are clearly much better designed then others, some of which only emphasize the first person aspects even more as you are not allowed to build along the enemies path at all. This just turns entire missions into a first person shooter with shooting that does little to excite. The new addition of boss waves simply takes all tower defense aspects and throws them out the window for the final wave. Bosses are able to destroy towers and wall bases, so on many maps a well designed layout will be instantly ruined as the boss targets a vital block and is soon followed by every other enemy in the wave.\n\nPros:\n\nThe character progression adds more value to replaying missions\nFour player co-op\nColourful eye catching visuals\nCons:\n\nA stronger focus on first person shooting, with little content within the shooting elements\nBalancing issues, some characters and towers are simply sub-par to others\nBoss waves completely ruin all aspects of tower defense\nLimited resources often leave your base design incomplete before the end\nFrame issues can sometimes cause huge frame rate drops\n\nSanctum 2′s attempts to become a stronger hybrid between tower defense and first person shooting by removing many tower elements of the first leaves Sanctum 2 with little identity. Becoming a jack of all trades, it simply becomes a case of “Anything I can do, you can do better.” If you want an action orientated defense game, Orcs Must Die 2 surpasses anything Sanctum 2 has to offer. For those who want a more traditional tower defense game then Defense Grid or Sanctum 1 have much more enjoyment to be had. The limitations of the new gameplay mechanics means nothing stands out, leaving a disappointing collection of “ok” and as such no reason to buy it over other titles available.","December 11, 2013","false","37.7"," 763 of 1,213 people (63%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","63","763","1","0","37"

I think it's pretty good if you're interested in that sort of play.  With all four DLC, it has well over 40 hours of puzzle-solving and exploration before the game devolves into grinding for Survival times.\n\nSanctum 2's solo and co-op gameplay is an evolutionary step away from Sanctum 1.  The primary differences are in scale and player utility.  That is, the scale is more intimate (close and smaller) while the player characters are specialized for certain utilities (sniper vs. AOE vs. close-range).\n\nAlthough it's still a Tower-Defense game blended with FPS elements, they philosophically moved away from how the first game worked: 'dozens of weak towers to kill most of the Lumes while the player focuses on a few key enemy-types' .... towards 'a dozen-ish strong towers which kill about one-half of the Lumes while the player uses special abilities to either help the towers take down all of the Lumes or kill special ones'.\n\nRather than every player being exactly the same, now there are four (five if you have the first DLC) different character classes to choose between who have different specializatons (such as sniper, rocketeer, soldier, and close-quarters).\n\nThe developer is very open to changing the game in ways the vocal fan-base seem to want it.  When S2 first launched, it received positive reviews by critics, but many fans of the original vocally didn't like it, because it had changed quite a bit from the S1.  Since then, the developer has modified the game to mollify the fans (allowing 15 towers per map instead of 10 like at launch, as well as other changes).\n\nThe developer is also continuing to add features free of additional charge such as the server browser for co-op players.\n\nLastly, I just finished the final DLC today, and I really liked it.  All four sets were well done: a good mix of interesting locations and enemies; a solid difficulty; and a good sense of satisfaction after winning some tough fights.\n\n(Updated 15 Dec to account for final DLC release)","July 13, 2013","true","69.7"," 48 of 61 people (79%) found this review helpful","79","48","61","0","0"

The white laboratory theme from the first Sanctum is only a small portion of the sequel, with outside environments making up most of the campaign levels. Many of the enemies are carried over from the first game and look pretty much the same. The sound design is excellent, with great weapon sounds and music that sets the science-fiction atmosphere incredibly well. It isn't quite as much tower defense as fans of the first game would probably hope for, since more of the emphasis this time around is placed on the first-person shooting element. It also hides way too much information from the player, leading to a lot of guess-and-check strategies. The game remains a refreshing hybrid of genres, however, and many of the frustrations temporarily wash away as you lay witness to the last enemy in the last wave die, proving that your strategic planning and accurate shooting have paid off.","September 10, 2014","true","22.1"," 41 of 51 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","41","51","0","0"

The simple truth is this. Sanctum 2 has been out for a little more than a year now and in that time the game itself has gone though many changes. So much so that it is hardly the game it was whence it first arrived on the market. Sure it's always been a FPS/tower defence, but in such a different way than when it was first released that a whopping 3 whole days after it's release, the Devs released a patch that set in motion the game you see before you today.\n\nNow, your time is precious, and I understand that, so for those looking for just the short answer to the question: "Should I buy this game?" That answer is, unequivocally, and without a doubt in my mind, wholeheartedly, seriously why haven't you just pushed the add to cart button and checked out already?!?!\n\nFor those of you who are of the more discerning...Steam...Steam-inites? Steam-ies? What suffix do we use to classify the people of our wonderful Steam Community? Hmm I wonder... In any case, for those of you wanting to be convinced, there are several reasons why this is the game for you, your mother, your brother's dog, and that pen-pal Geoffrey who you wrote to and exchanged letters with in primary school from Uzbeki-beki-stan-stan, that always said he was going to come visit, but never really had the means to do so; still it was nice to see someone from the other side of the planet and who had just as many gramatical and spelling errors in their writings as third grade you did back in the day. Yeah, remember Geoffrey? Well even though he wont be visiting "Amerika", he probably now plays this game and if you play this game too, the both of you have the option of text to speech chat! Ah yes, you heard me correctly, TEXT. TO. SPEECH. In an almost Stephen Hawking like manner (until you select your character that is), you can wow the masses with literal pronunciations of the written English language which is always good for a laugh, but terrible for poor old Geoffrey who's been desperately trying to learn how to pronounce words that he couldn't learn from his Speak&Spell.\n\n"Ok, so what's so great about that", you ask as you feel so very smug in your smug chair, wearing your smug bathrobe, listening to smug jazz, sipping your imported smugness coffee/tea/caffinated beverage, and occasionally adjusting your monocle...smuggly. Listen here Smuggy, have you ever heard Stephen Hawking sing the theme to the A-Team? No, you haven't? WELL I HAVE. And this game has let me do that, it sounded much like I thought it would if Stephen Hawking were part of the A-Team. "Big deal", you say? Well a little known fact about Stephen Hawking is that he has relatives, that's right, relatives! And whether they're actually related or not there's a player here in our very own Steam Community who goes by the very similar name of Tiger Hawkins.\n*(Flashback)*\nLong ago, in a galaxy far far away... he very bravely (and without the use of right pinky) fought off hordes of Lumes (the game's monsters) in a Survival challenge set forth by the Developers in Sanctum 1 with the promise of everlasting fame, fortune, and imortalization within their games. Alone on the battle field his war raged on, until finally, he cleared the threshold of damage being able to be dealt and beat the Devs at their own game! (Actually he just survived the most waves out of anyone...ever) He was imortalized in both games just as the Devs had promised, and he lived happily ever after.\n*(End Flashback)*\n\nFeel like the game has been out far too long for you to bandwagon onto? Not a chance! With every new Steam sale, a horde of eager beavers, not unlike yourself, flood through the gates of Elysion One Core Guardian training grounds and look like a bunch of fools until someone with a little more knowhow plays a map with you and corrects the error of your ways. To which you feel a little butt-hurt about it and you go off and play single player for a while until you realize that "HOLY CRAP, THIS ISN'T LIKE OTHER FPS GAMES IN WHICH THE ONLINE COMMUNITY IS JUST FULL OF RUDE ASSHATS AND TROLLS, AND THEY WERE JUST TRYING TO HELP ME LEARN!!!!" (*cough* sorry, accidental capslock and whatnot)\nSeriously, the co-op community in Sanctum 2 is very quick to come to the defense of someone who is 1.) New. 2.) Under Attack. or 3.) Being yelled by someone who they themselves aren't pulling their own weight.\n\nWant to be UBER L33T 360 NOSCOPE 420BLAZE-IT and go charging in head first, not a care in the world, complete disregard for your own safety for the sake of your own team mates? Go right ahead, so long as you have the right perks equiped. "Wait a minute, there's perks too?" Yes, there are. There are TONS of them, and you get to pick a few per map to help customize your own play style. Don't feel as though you need to be the guy mentioned above as you would rather spend your time building a map so that your towers do all the hard work? Sure, that's possible too! Find that you're at neither extreme and would like to join the rest of us under the Bell-curve? Great, see you there! *high five*\n\nCharacter skins, DLC maps, guns, perks, DEATH, Sanctum two has it all! But wait, order now in the next immediate time frame and CoffeeStain studios will supersize your order by throwing in their trademark easter eggs! Ever wanted to occupy your character with some rad-arcade-gaming action while you wait for your online friends to decide whether to upgrade this tower over here, or that one over there? BOOM! Wish granted! There are game stations that you can find in game maps that will allow you to play games within the game! Game-ception! (Except that I really hate this trend of adding "ception" to anything that happens within itself. Yes the movie started it all, but the title when way over your heads. Inception, was what it was called because of the plot point of planting the seed of an idea, not because they needed to go 12 billion layers deep! Whatever, Game-ception!)\n\nIf that last point hasn't convinced you then there's not so much more I can do to convince you other than letting you know that this game has a super chill soundtrack, significant amounts of replay-ability, and you get to shoot things in the face/back/butt/weakspot, causes you to think and then punishes you for making bad decisions, and when you finally manage to beat it, you enable the Feats of Strength, and relearn every single mechanic the game has with expert precision, timing, and bragging rights per wave when the MVP status is awarded.\nBuy the game.\nBuy the DLC.\nAnd maybe, just maybe, this wonderful game will reunite you with Geoffrey.","July 3, 2014","true","313.5"," 172 of 281 people (61%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","61","172","281","2","18"

A few maps are heavily dependent upon towers at easier difficulties but you quickly discover that the right combination of character and weapon can do more damage than all your towers combined, and hard mode is designed with this in mind.   There are some levels where you can do 90% of the total damage done and still lose the round.  And then the designers start trying to achieve greater difficulty by throwing in enemies that are 100% immune to towers, and then gimmicky enemies that towers stop targetting and then they return to 100% health if you don't kill them by yourself fast enough.\n\nThe worst part is that they have all the elements for perfection.  Their map design is really creative but then they only give you a  few walls and towers to work with, leaving you feeling like a kid drooling at the lego box for the Millenium Falcon but then looking down at your hand and realizing you only have a dozen blocks to work with. When you only have 2 towers going into round four and maybe 5 or 6 towers going into the final round, there's not much stategy. The game would be more more fun if you were given far more walls and towers and the outcome were determined more by your maze building and tower placement skills, rather than picking the right weapons and perks and then showing off on youtube by killing all the enemies without even bothering to build your token towers.\n\nI thought this would be less of a problem in survival mode but there is no true survival mode.  Survival is just normal mode with the normal waves but it repeats after the last wave and just boosts the health, speed, and regen of enemies by a LOT.  So rather than being a mode where you can try to build the perfect setup and then see how many waves of every increasing monsters you can last through, you're instead just left with another form of hard mode that lasts maybe two or three times as long as normal.\n\nI've never seen a game be SO close to perfection and then just ruin it with poor design choices.  But if you like PVE FPS then I do still recommend this game for you.  Just don't expect much tower strategy in hard mode or you'll be disappointed.","September 29, 2014","false","98.0"," 268 of 449 people (60%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","60","268","449","10","18"

It can't seem to decide what it wants to be, and it can't stop holding the player on a leash.\n\nUnlike the original Sanctum which was very clearly a tower defense game as well as a shooter, Sanctum 2 focuses almost entirely on the shooting.  The game gimps your ability to build proper mazes or place any significant number of towers, and oftentimes, your towers just can't do enough damage to matter and you find yourself relying more on your own gun. Furthermore, at certain intervals, the game forgoes the standard strategic preparation phase and gives you an abysmally short countdown.  Not only is this countdown unable to be paused if you need to go use the bathroom in between waves, but it hardly gives you enough time to walk across the map, let alone build any towers.  It's like the game itself is telling you "No time for strategy!  Go shoot things! Go go go!"\n\nThis wouldn't be that bad if the shooting element weren't so generic and constrained.  The game limits you to a loadout of two weapons, and locks you into your first weapon depending on your character, so your only customization is a single weapon.  Furthermore, unlike the previous game, weapons aren't even upgradeable.  It's like the game wants you to focus on shooting aspect, but at the same time doesn't actually let you focus on the shooting aspect.\n\nOverall, Sanctum 2 feels like a game that doesn't know what it wants to be and, worst, doesn't want you doing too much.  It was not a fun experience and my trust in the developers has been grievously violated.","May 6, 2014","false","6.3"," 48 of 79 people (61%) found this review helpful","61","48","79","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/recommended/210770/","gosedre","Gosedre","http://steamcommunity.com/id/gosedre/","215 products in account","So the premise of this game is that humans have established colonies in the skies over an alien planet. They use magical blue balls of light (cores) to convert the gasses present into oxygen and kill the native spores. The problem is that the planet is already occupied by an alien race of highly evolved mushrooms. The mushroom people under the direction of unknown telepathic boss entity whom you never fight create giant organic shafts to the colonies to try to murder them dead.\n\nIn the game you will create a maze of towers in an attempt to halt the advance of the mushroom people before they destroy you're magical blue ball as is typical of a Tower Defense game. you will spend 5, 10 or 15 minutes per level depositing towers that will ultimately only do about thirty percent of the damage necessary to kill the enemy waves. The rest is up to you. You can choose two of a plethora of weapons to aid you in the struggle. The game does not address why a gun held by a five foot two to six foot tall human out damages half dozen tool shed sized tower mounted guns you drop and arguably that means this game isn't really a TD. There are "perks" you can select to improve you're characters/towers performance but there’s really nothing that will turn this game into an actual Tower Defense, which is unfortunate.\n\nThe longer you play the game the more powerful guns, perks and towers you can unlock, particularly if you buy the DLC. I'm sure we all know the DLC drill by now. For an extra five dollars you will get access to all the content that was cut from the game during the alpha and beta tests for quality control and balance reasons. Ideally that content has since been fixed/balanced/polished but we never know until we shell out the cash. To their credit the DLC for Sanctum 2 does provide a lot of interesting content. The towers, perks and maps it adds do a great deal to increase replayability of the game and it rounds out the base games story that ends on a cliffhanger.\n\nThe real strength of this game is the level design. Like every other piece of science fiction made in the past twelve years almost everything looks like an Ipod that said this game does it particularly well. The integration of organic vines and spores growing over the utopian surfaces/structures in this game are very imaginative and well done. A lot of games (Doom 3/Dead Space) place a strong aesthetic emphasis in a human environment being reverse terraformed by some perverse alien influence but truthfully Sanctum 2 does it better. The levels are distinct from each other in groups as you proceed from an idealistic lived in colony under attack to the deteriorating front lines to an industrial themed colony abandoned some years or generations earlier. The theme is that the further into the game you go the closer to the planet you get until ultimately you are beneath its surface in a giant cavern with mushroom Jesus. In the tradition of classic FPS games there are many many secret areas and players are rewarded for their diligent exploration. Ironically the maps are far bigger in scope then the developers were prepared to work with and you’ll shudder when you realize that you can’t incorporate some of the games incredibly ideal choke points into you’re defense as they are simply too far away from where the action will be…. If they allowed you to place your own cores the quality of the game would quadruple immediately but thats something they will have to consider for a sequel.\n\nThe biggest issue with the game is the many many clipping errors. This game will kill you or force you to consul command suicide many times as you fall through solid objects or get stuck between them. In the basic game it doesn’t matter very much as you can wait out the 9 second respawn time once or twice and it isn’t likely to lose the game for you. Tragically the developers compounded this issue by encouraging the players to play with “five feats of strength” on to create a more challenging experience… One of these “feats” is a no respawn mode… So basically each time you die to a developer error, which will be once or twice a game, you’ll also lose the level. Since playing with the feats of strength on is going to be your last real experience with the game they are brutally poisoning their consumer base who will only remember losing 30 minutes of an expertly played game because Coffe Stain Studio's didn’t properly patch or beta test. Hardcore modes are made for polished games made by hardcore developers. It might be a tough pill for Coffee Stain Studios to swallow but they just haven’t reached that point yet.\n\nFor ten dollars it is a really cool indie game. The maps if not always utilized ideally are a clever visual spectacle and it does have a lot of replay value. If Coffee Stain Studio focuses on adding general content to their games and take their player testers a little more seriously these guys could easily be around for another few years. Otherwise they'll find themselves doing the 3d effects for their regional weather channels talking about once whens.","February 16, 2015","true","189.9"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"

The Game seems to lean more towards the First-Person shooter at the beginning of a round, then gets progressively more strategic as the waves come and go as you are able to build more towers. The combination of the two genres is almost flawless as the vast array of towers are almost identical to the character's weapon. The characters are unique yet can all be paramount to the group's success, as the player's weapons have massive firepower. In the later game, team-mates can really help.\n\nMusic - The soundtrack is amazing. There have been times where I haven't started a wave, just so I could listen to the music. The waves also have their own music, so hearing the soundtrack as I blasted lumes with rockets filled me with adrenaline.\n\nNote: The Soundtrack is now available by itself as DLC.\n\nPerformance & Graphics - The Game mostly quite well on an entry-level card and looks amazing, however a few config tweaks can push it to run very smoothly and look beautiful. The art style and environment is unique as the game is set on an alien planet full of forests, Loek III, which has become inhabited by humans. The lumes are unique aliens in that they are not bug-like or technologically advanced, but are strong and will do anything to destroy the player's precious core. The lumes are varied depending on their role and rank, which makes it easy to identify the difference between a walker and a walker warrior.\n\nThe game is supported on PC, Mac and now Linux. Controller support is available, though I would suggest using Keyboard and mouse.\n\nIf you see this game on sale, I would suggest picking it up with the Season pass. You will not be disappointed.","June 20, 2014","true","135.5"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

Sanctum 2 is much closer to a true hybrid of FPS and tower defense. Teamwork and marksmanship are MUCH more important than they were in Sanctum 1, everything is much faster paced, and you will no longer be able to make huge, insanely complex, super-efficient mazes. Essentially, Sanctum 1 was maybe 20% shooter, 80% tower defense. Sanctum 2 is 50/50.\n\nIf you were expecting gameplay identical to the first Sanctum, you'll probably RAEG.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/recommended/210770/","rockstarcro","RockstarCRO","http://steamcommunity.com/id/rockstarcro/","252 products in account","In short, Sanctum 2 is what happens when tower defense meets first person. Imagine playing Starcraft sunken D with Jim Raynor randomly standing around somewhere, except you're dead smack in Raynor's shoes looking through his visor.\n\nBesides being physically appealing, Sanctum 2 delivers, to say the least, some diverse and varied game play thanks to it's FPS incarnation. The primary objective in the maps is to keep enemies away from destroying your power core. Enemies come in varied shapes, forms, sizes, and abilities. The most annoying enemies are the flying ones that seem to ignore tower/brick placements. Other enemies can be small and quick or large and slow. The big enemies all have a certain sweet spot you need to shoot in order to take them down accordingly. The characters within the game (4 all together) all have differing abilities but are more or less the same in strength. I personally chose the girl with the double jump ability because you can't beat jumping in mid air and defying gravity. Their weapons also differ and special. The more shots my character successfully lands on an enemy means the more damage the subsequent bullet will deal. Besides normal rate of firing, the character also has a secondary firing system for their weapons which can be triggered by pressing RB. Alternatively, players can swap between two weapons as seen in Halo series. The secondary weapon also has the ability for alternative fire. Tower bases can be placed in certain locations (as seen on the HUD mini map), and actual gun towers cannot be placed freely. Bases guide enemies and only a certain amount is given every wave. Gun and base combinations are possible but only if bases are available. Unlike starcraft multi player defense games, not every base can host a tower. Tower's cost a pretty penny by themselves, the player also has to take into consideration whether to install a new tower or to upgrade an old one. Some of the tower types include a gunner, a shock proximity sort of machine, a tower that slows enemies down (very handy), gatling gun, and not limited to rockets.\n\nGraphics are pretty spot on and resemble a cross between Cloudbuilt, Borderlands and Call of Juarez. Sounds do immerse one into the game and gun fire sounds somewhat futuristic and accurate. The towers make different noises depending which one you install and the enemies all sound like their a bat out of hell. I should mention the heads-up display (HUD) has been done with great care. It is hard to keep track of towers and which way enemies will go, there is a minimap provided to show you the route in which enemies take, which also shows where your blocks/towers are and at what level your towers are at. This is insanely handy.\n\nOverall a good game with a decent price. I would highly recommend the purchase on sale. I personally like it for taking a step in a daring direction. It isn't easy to mix a tower defense and FPS concept together.\n\nRATING : 7.25/10\n\nScreenShots :\nThe mini map plays a huge role in planning","September 20, 2015","true","2.8"," 10 of 13 people (77%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","77","10","13","0","0"

Well tough cause you can't\n\nMaps: I honestly don't like having the map be so bloody small, it feels like your in a tight space and you can't really go anywhere.\n\nEnemies: This kind of sucks honestly, yes they fight back, but you have health for gods sake, and you lose it quick.\n\nTeleport system: Guess what? They took away the teleportation, seriously what the heck? That was one of the great things about the first game, if you were in the front and the enemies were in the back you could teleport over to them if you had a teleporter and start shooting them with your towers.\n\nDeath: Yes, you can die now, and guess what? If you die, you have to WAIT for a respawn, yeah, you fall off the map somehow? No teleport out, you have to wait till the respawn is done\n\nFriendly NPC's: Well I know they can be of SOME use at times, but when they are dead they are gone, and you can actually kill them yourself, with a gun or by spawning a tower on them.\n\nTower limit: Now this got me very angry, and annoyed, in the 1st game you could put up AS MANY towers as you wanted (Provided you had enough space and money to do so) now you have a limit, AND GUESS WHAT?! It counts for co-op too, yes, if you are in a game with 1 or more friends, the tower limit is combined, IE, if a friend puts up a cannon or a gattling gun, it counts as a tower used for you too.\n\nBoss battle: At the end of the chapter I think, there is a boss, and he can destroy EVERY, SINGLE, ONE of your towers and blockades, making all of your hard earned money basically be useless.\n\nCan't upgrade weapons: Nope, this is removed AS WELL, you can't upgrade weapons, you pick a gun, that gun stays the same, no getting it stronger or faster, or quicker reload, it's just the same all the time.\n\nOut of all the stuff they have put in and removed, I can only give this game a 4 or 5/10 It needs a lot of improvement, and it should have been kept at it's roots, not trying to branch off and be a stupid First Person Shooter clone, it should have been it's tower based shooting like it was before.","January 26, 2014","false","4.7"," 59 of 106 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","59","106","2","1"

It isn't quite as much tower defense as fans of the first game would probably hope for, since more of the emphasis this time around is placed on the first-person shooting element. It also hides way too much information from the player, leading to a lot of guess-and-check strategies. The game remains a refreshing hybrid of genres, however, and many of the frustrations temporarily wash away as you lay witness to the last enemy in the last wave die, proving that your strategic planning and accurate shooting have paid off.It looks like Sanctum and it sounds like Sanctum, but it plays totally differently. While the more devoted fans of the first game might take issue with a lot of the changes, and while it doesn't match up to that game's heights, there's still some things to enjoy in Sanctum 2.","April 12, 2014","true","34.6"," 11 of 16 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","11","16","0","0"

Sanctum 2 is a more challanging version of the first one, Yes you get Less waves than the 1st one, but the game limits you, forcing you to choose the most efficient way to protect your core with a limited ammount of resources, and of course choosing the right class/ character and tower sets is the best way you can achieve victory!\n\nIf you Bought All the DLCs you Get TWICE of sanctum 2 and new weapons , towers, maps, enemies, perks and a new character. Basically, it have more replayability than the first one.\n\nIf you're Still reading this. Stop reading and buy this game!.....and the DLC\n\nUPDATE 1/25/2014 DLC 1 REVIEW\n\nOkay i recently beat the game and played "The Road to Elysion" DLC, it adds 2 new weapons, 4 maps, and perks that i'm too lazy to count, therefor you get an extra 1/4 of the original game also you get a new character to play with.\n\nYou get TSYGAN As a new playable core guardian, equipped with a crossbow, the maps requires a lot of thinking but if you tag along with another player or more (lv 20+ is recomennded) it's so. Much. Chaos.\n\nUPDATE 7/27/2014 DLC 3 REVIEW\n\nAfter a couple of months not playing this game, i decided to beat the 3rd DLC. "The Persuit" DLC is basically gives you another 2 new weapons and 4 new stages, with some perks as well.\nAlso This DLC Gives you the First cutscene of the game. THE FIRST CUTSCENE.\n\nThe weapons and towers are the highlights of this DLC. First The most popular weapon and the most unique weapon in the game: The drone launcher. With the abillity to shoot Little planes and detonate them if you want, And then we have the Granade launcher. a standalone version of the Default Assault rifle's Secondary shot. the towers you get is a Mind control tower and a "Friendship Laser/tower" that's more powerful if you deploy them next to each other\n\nUPDATE 2/7/2014 DLC 4 REVIEW\n\nAlright, Beaten the 4th DLC, The "Last Stand" DLC have 4 Challanging Maps, 2 new towers, and 2 new guns, and some perks. This DLC Is between easy and hard, unless you're Level 37+ This should be a piece of cake for you. The new stuff that's in this DLC is More Aerial Enemies, And a Mountable Turret called "Rolfinator" it's a Player controlled turret that only fires 20 powerful shots, but that doesn't make it easy, Aerial Enemies Are Far Weaker and easier to kill, But they're on a higher altitude and comes in large swarms (usually 20 or more) Some of the Music From the first Sanctum can be heard playing when the wave starts, Luckily You get a special tower that easily kills aerial targets, The weapons are useful too, But i'm already spoiling much spoilers so...this dlc is pretty awesome.","January 20, 2014","true","87.9"," 14 of 22 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","14","22","0","1"

Not the best thing ever but it works fine.\n+Perhaps not something meaningful for other people, but being a Coop game where you actually have to work together with your allies rather than shoot them on the face as any FPS is a big pro for me.\n\nCons\n-Some turrets can be... well, entirely useless, while others become more or less a must have for most of the maps (ex: Violator), ruining in some way the porpuse of having a wide variety of turrets.\n-When playing with others, if you have a lvl 30+ player join with new players or low level ones, the player with high level can make many of the first half of maps trivial or way too easy.\n\nVeredict:\nWhile it is not the perfect game or one to call "game of the year!" or similar, it is a fun game to play if you have nothing better to, even more if you have friends to play it with and its not an expensive one at that (and it often goes on sale here on Steam).","August 23, 2014","true","49.5"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

Don't dive this one expecting more of the same. First timer? Buy if you want to play a co-op FPS with TD elements.\n\nLong Version:\nGameplay - As the SV says, Sct2 takes the hybrid TD/FPS of it's predecessor and pumps the FPS part of it while streamlining the TD parts so it feels more conducive to the experience. Everything is more limited, you can have towers, but not that many, you can have tower bases but mazing is limited, you get weapons, but don't choose when to upgrade them, getting a perk system that greatly affects how you are able to tackle the invading forces. The shooting part feels much better and is often more efective, especially when alined with the right perks, so you might find yourself clearing 100% of the wave by yourself, or having to because the towers are ill-equipped to do so. On a bright note, co-op'ing the game is pretty great and gives you a few more TD'ing/perk options, I had a blast clearing the campaign with friends.\n\n\nStory - You are now given a choice of character with different looks, motivations, fighting perks, etc. Alongside that, we are given a context to all the missions in the form of comic book style narrative before them. Playing Sct2 feels much more personal, we know what's at stake and the very decent voice acting cries out to fallen friends and critical hits alike, a big plus for the campaign mode.\n\nSound - As a huge fan of Sct1 soundtrack I was slightly disapointed by Sct2's. It's not bad, it's just not as good, the tunes feel more repetitive and there's less gems in the rough. Still a decent fit for the game's theme.\n\nGraphics - Just like Sct1, they fit the futuristic theme the game and I have little of note to complain about, everything is, of course, more detailed.\n\nExtra note - Having invaders that destroy structures is not impossible to do in TD's, but they are not very well done here, your whole round can go to hell because your maze was destroyed and that's not fun when there's no save or checkpoint.","May 9","true","188.7"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

I can maybe see that the tower base limits were to force you to build incrementally, rather than splurge all your money on building the maze up-front, although for many maps they just don't give you enough of them. The tower limit is at least perhaps an intent to make you form concentrated kill-zones, rather than just carpeting the map with scatter lasers. It's still got rocket-jumping. For one character.\n\nA lot is missing. Holo blocks. Floor tiles. The overview map you could put beacons on. Televators. A final map which isn't one miserable luck-based will-the-boss-be-distracted-or-just-carve-a-beeline-through-my-defenses difficulty spike.\n\nBut the real reason for the big, red thumbs-down is persistent unlocks. For a PvE co-op game they are utterly stupid, since if any of your friends don't want to spend the requisite hours grinding missions over and over with difficulty feats enabled, they're going to be less effectual and have fewer choices than you, and thus have a less fun experience.

At first, it appeared to be a simple tower defense game, where you can fight in as well. But I have to say, I'm pleasantly surprised.\n\nThe tower defense bit I can be simple about: It's your basic tower defense. Machine guns, high damage guns, slowdown turrets, those kinda weapons are available, and all upgradable. You can buy them with credits you earn through gameplay. You place these guns on blocks, that you can use to lay out the path for the enemy to follow.\n\nFor the ingame fighting, you can choose from 4a5 characters to play, which basically determines your main weapon: Shotgun, sniper, machinegun. By leveling you get access to more weapons and other stuff. Although the weapons are not upgradable, you can use perks to increase their damage.\n\nBut it's the versatility of the in-game combat that give it that little bit extra that makes it interesting. You can engage some enemies, so they attack you and can be lured away from the path. Some enemies have higher damage points on their bodies, for extra damage, if you can hit it. Some perks can really help in killing off those enemies. In short, it's not just simple shooting that has been added, it gives it that little extra that makes you wanna play the game some more, just to try out those little extra perks or weapons, to see if you can get further.\n\nThere is 4 player coop, where all resources can be shared freely.\n\nAnd graphically, it's ok. I do like how they added the little men to fight with you. They suck at combat, but it's a little extra that gives the game a 'face'.\n\nBasically, if you like tower defense and FPS, you'll like this.\n\n","August 16, 2014","true","55.0"," 7 of 9 people (78%) found this review helpful","78","7","9","0","0"

The design and concept are lovely, and I always enjoy smaller game companies. I used to adore tower defense games in my earlier years, but after I discovered Steam, I started to drift away from the tower defense games I'd play online. I started to play more FPS-Type games such as Gmod, Half-Life 2, and TF2. One day I closed a steam game, and was greeted with the exciting sight of a steam news window. Scrolling through it, I came across a "newly released" page featuring Sanctum 2. All I remember was that the picture had Skye on it, and I thought "Oh, this is interesting character design. I'll check this out." (Yes, I'm a sucker for gingers.) So I watched the trailer, then eagerly waited for the demo to download. I bought the full game shortly after clearing the demo, and I was not disappointed.\n\nA note for those with less-than-behemoth GPU's, since the creators don't have a huge amount of resources availible, they don't have all that much spare time for graphical optimization, so it may get a bit choppy with the higher settings.\n\n\nTL;DR: Cute gingers, strong female characters, perfect genre (For me, at least.)

Sanctum 2 takes the brilliant aspects from the first one and pushes it further with a much more dynamic and fluid campaign.\n\nStory:\nOn the planet of Loek III an infestation begins. An alien species, which is actually burrowed into the planet has awoken and it is the job your squad to stop them. Skye Autumn, Sweet Autumn, SiMo, Haigen Hawkins, and Tsygan form a squad and work to protect the cores from collapsing. The cores defend and power the cities, but it’s not long till you figure out that they cores are not everything they seem.\n\nCampaign:\nThe original campaign includes four sectors each composed of four missions. The sectors include: Facility, Rocky Fields, Giant Trees, and Swamp. In each of these sectors you must complete a tower defense on a strategic field, using one of the five playable heroes. The game defaults to open party meaning anyone can join your game, but you can switch it to private if you want to play alone. I always found Tower Defenses to be a single player event, unless you operate separate lanes, as clashing strategies can ruin the games value. The campaign allows you to add “Feats of Strength” which increase the difficulty, but also add to the XP bonus from each round. In order to complete the game 100% you must complete each map with all five Feats of Strength (excluding Introduction). I played Sanctum by myself and found I was rarely playing the FPS portion after the first level, although by adding Feats of Strength you will no longer be able to sit around and watch. The levels have lots of secrets hidden within them including arcade machines or even just random little subsections. The campaign essentially constitutes the entire game as there is no sandbox option.\n\nGameplay:\nUnlike traditional Tower Defenses Sanctum offers you the chance to jump in as an FPS to help control creep flow. Each map you complete offers you XP which allows you to level up your squad, unlike in a traditional RPG fashion no matter who you play in Sanctum all the squad members are the same level. As you progress through the game this means you unlock new towers, better weapons, and special abilities. The towers and the weapons are not equal, so as you progress through the game you’ll probably find yourself using the same kit. Eventually when you reach level 40 you unlock both weapons allowing you to select both of the characters weapons making only their abilities matter. Luckily the vast amount of character customization allows you to play the game however you desire.\n\nDLC:\nSanctum 2 has four game content DLC packs: The Last Stand, The Pursuit, Ruins of Brightholme, and Road to Elysion. These DLC packs include four sectors: Coastline, Brightholme, Outskirts, and Arc Islands. These essentially double the length of the campaign and sixteen new missions. The story of Sanctum 2 is actually not over after the initial campaign is completed and in order to figure out exactly what happens on Loek III you must finish the DLC. After completing sector four, Swamp, you are left off exactly where the DLC begins. Each DLC pack is $3.99, which is actually quite expensive seeing as it adds very little content (a couple enemies and a few new maps). The Last Stand, Arc Islands, offers a level with essentially unlimited waves that get progressively more difficult. If you were looking for essentially a sandbox mode, this would be the closest you can get.\n\nMultiplayer:\nThe game is default multiplayer, this means that when you start your campaign anyone can join you on your mission and help you out. I didn’t realize this until after I started and some random person was in my mission. As a result I backed out kicked them out of my part and changed my game settings to private. For those who are interested Sanctum 2 multiplayer offers an incredibly easy multiplayer system that is almost flawless.\n\nResults:\nIf you are a fan of First Person Shooters then Sanctum 2 is a good game for you. If you are a fan of tower defenses then Sanctum 2 is a good game for you. Sanctum 2 is a fun game which offers strategy and action bundled together as you defend a core objective from waves of minions. The DLC adds additional missions to the game, which if you can get on a sale are completely worth it. The character customization and leveling system really allows you to choose how you play the game. Despite not having unlimited blocks like the original, Sanctum 2, requires you to focus on short-term strategy at the start then eventually long-term as you progress past the first few waves. I would recommend Sanctum 2 for anyone who felt like the original lacked in FPS and character development.\n\nPros:\n+Character customization\n+Smooth and clean graphics\n+Large variety of minions that require you to be diverse.\n+Loads of maps\n+DLC which adds more levels, story, and enemies.\n+Great multiplayer\n+FPS as well as TD\n+Secrets in levels\n+Great level design\n+Bosses which change the dynamic of the maze design.\n+Various levels which require different strategies (FPS intensive vs TD intensive)\n+On map allies (they may not do much damage, but it looks nice to have some teammates)\n+You can upgrade towers beyond their maximum level, essentially increasing there damage beyond the upgrade levels\n\nCons:\n-After beating Sanctum 2, The Last Stand, you cannot skip the credits.\n-Multiplayer is defaulted on\n-There is no just plain simple sandbox map\n-You are limtied to the number of base bricks you can place (you get anywhere from 5-15 per wave) but eventually you start geting 0\n-You can only place around 15 towers per map (this varies on the map I believe).\n-You can no longer upgrade your weapons (although they seem to scale by themselves)\n-To get 100% essentially requires co-operative play.","April 20, 2014","true","39.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

There are many towers but as you learn more about the game and start playing at higher difficulties, and survival, you will notice that only a few are worth your while, meaning that the game is fundamentally unbalanced.\n\nHowever, it is still highly enjoyable both alone and with friends. The levels are absolutely stunning and exploring them is encouraged by many easter eggs, achievements, and AR-Mines that are hidden throughout the game. Take a while on every level and look up and around and enjoy the beautiful artwork.

I have had this game for a while now and bought it due to a sale and it seemed like a good game and I wasn’t mistaken. The point of this game is to protect the core/s (the giant device that is providing oxygen to the area) from the Lumes (the enemies that are attacking the core) using towers and your primary and secondary weapons. Although I can’t tell the difference between the base game and all the DLC packs (since I bought the full pack when I bought the game initially) the game has around 20 towers that are advantageous in specific situations and 14 guns that can deal with one specific Lume easier than another and lots of perks to give you the added benefit over others. The map count is also very large at around 30 maps and the maps themselves are ginormous in some cases while normally the maps are still quite large.\n\nThere are three game types to choose from in the game and these are just the regular protect the core game, the FOS (feat of strength which is commonly abbreviated to FOS) version of the protect the core game which adds specific perks for the Lumes like enemies attack twice as fast, players cannot respawn during the wave but they can after, enemies regenerate 150 hit points per second, enemies move faster, enemies have 50% more hit points each wave round (Wave rounds are about 4 to 5 waves long and is the time for the wave to add more health to the enemy (If that specific FOS is turned on)), and survival which is to play the protect the core game mode for an infinite amount of waves with the waves getting harder each wave round (as FOS are added as you gain waves and that one of the FOS cause the upgrade of Lume health per wave rounds). The way to survive in this game is to shoot the Lumes dead using your primary and secondary weapon and during the building phase you can build/upgrade/overcharge your towers to keep you alive for longer and also becomes a lot more essential in survival as if you have survived long enough then the Lumes health becomes too high for your guns to make a difference and hence the game then relies on your towers very heavily.\n\nPros\n-Lots of content (towers, maps, Lume types, perks, weapons)\n-Maps are ginormous\n-Replay value\n-Game genre combination\n-Weak spots on Lumes\n-Maps visually vary quite majorly\n-The amazing text-to-speech (that should be in every game)\n-The art design for everything in the game (weapons, towers, maps, etc) is superb\n-Very few bugs (however when they occur it’s bloody hilarious)\n\n\nCons\n-Smaller community then most games ()\n-No longer receives any updates\n-The story (that is represented by small comics) is very small\n-Some complain of the weapon taking up too much of their screen (but I think it’s fine)\n\nConclusion\nOverall this game to me is a gem that is often overlooked and due to that the games popularity suffers (http://steamcharts.com/app/210770) however I have thoroughly enjoyed it and I have gifted this game to 4-5 other people because I support the game so much. I recommend this game for people who like tower defense games, people who love beautiful games, and people who love strategy or strategising.","March 12","true","222.6"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

I really can't say when the last time I enjoyed a game this much was. The sanctum series really took the tower defense genre is a great direction, and the feel, look, and sound of the game is stellar. The soundtrack alone is enough for me to recommend you checking it out, but thankfully this game is much more than just a beautiful package.\n\nYou've got a variety of towers, characters, passives, and weapons to select from, and each of them matters. The character you pick determines what primary you bring, but you get to choose a secondary along with it, and that secondary can be the primary of another character. Synergy is the name of the game, so there's a lot of fun to be had experimenting with different strategies for different maps and enemies. Each character plays differently and brings their own unique passive, and most every weapon, tower, and passive plays a vital role in how you effectively play the game. Stronger weakpoint hits? Looks like you'll want to bring a strong accurate weapon to abuse weakpoints while you bring another tower to make up for your lack of heavy AoE. Or maybe you'd like to bring a strong single target primary, AoE secondary, and bring only utility towers to supplement your weaponry.\n\nThe amount of experimentation that you can do in this game, along with the wide map variety and consistently fantastic soundtrack really kept me enjoying this game for dozens and dozens of hours. I've bought it every time it's been on sale just so I have copies to give to friends. I love this game that much.","March 28","true","87.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

By placing limitations on the towers, they have destroyed the tower defence part of the game and made it a pretty much standard shooter. It’s still a fun game to play, and is priced realistically, but I’m afraid that people who played Sanctum 1 may well be very disappointed with the step away from tower defence.  Is it recommended?

The good thing about Sanctum 2 is it 's good blend of tower defense and Firt person shooter genres.  If you like tower defense games you will enjoy.  If you like first person shooters you will enjoy.\n\nOne thing to keep in mind is the clear line of thought that cut straight through the center of this experience.  You must use both sides of your brain to play effectively.\n\n1) You place blocks on the ground to build a maze.  Not just any maze.  Use your best creative efforts to create a maze that will make the Lumes (enemies) talk longer to get to the Core (objective).\n\n2) Place towers in a STRATEGICALLY adavantagous location.  Set up choke points where the maze becomes it's most complex and give those lumes one for!\n\n3) Suppliment the towers that you place acting like police and clean-up crew. FIGHT!\n\nHalf the time you MUST think like a chess player the other half think like a soldier.  Remember that there's no such thing as the best tower.  Being a good player is as a result of  thinking defensively; Look ahead and think ahead.\n\nNo, it's not all about the pew pew pew.  It's about using your brain and working for the TEAM.  Some people are good at mazes, some people are good at blowing s**t up and yet some people are good at both.\n\nMy point, what makes this game exceptionally goo is the players that play for the team.  You must always remember that. I see too many people that level up yet lack basic strategy that ruins the experience.  I'll put it this way.  Why would you spend 1 hour playing 10 rounds of this game without intent to be sucessful.  I play to win and most people play video games to, you guessed it, WIN.\n\nIf you can't think like a chess player then DON'T play this game.  Only half the game is fighting the other half is planning.  Really, of you 've taken a few IQ tests then some of it will look awfully familiar.\n\nUsually a review would talk about game mechanics and I'm perhaps being remiss not going thta route but this game is unique.   I large portion of that experience comes from the synergy created between the players.  Remeber friendship is magic ;)\n\nYour lord and master,\n\nmematron aka dudeacus","December 18, 2014","true","980.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","2"

A few examples: Apparently I've completed 63% of the first zone, after finishing it. The completionist I am, I would now like to get 100% completion there. But I don't know how, because the game doesn't tell me how completion is achieved, though I assume by finishing the levels without damage to the core. However, there is no indicator in which level I have how much progression.\nAnother example is the interface in levels. In this kind of game you will have quite a full interface, and I found the map being very well done. However, there seems to be no information to the player's health. The next wave is announced by presenting the icons of the enemies approaching, paired with how many will appear. As someone who just started this game, this doesn't tell me anything ("Oh, these are fliers..." or "Oh, those things have a ranged attack..."). It is propably enough if you know the game well, but the enemy design is not distinguished enough to make this easy.\n\nThe second thing really bothering me is the shooting, which is just not fun for me. When you empty the magazine of one weapon and switch to your secondary, the game automatically reloads (after some time) the first weapon. This leads to situations where you would usually only use one weapon (e.g. if you want splash damage, which only one of your weapons has), but it's more effective to empty the magazine of one weapon, switch weapons, empty magazine, switch, and so on. This is quite dull and unsatisfying.\n\nThese are the main reasons why I just can not recommend Sanctum 2. The first things mentioned are just things I expect from a tower defense game to be any good, the second point is something which totally spoils the action part for me.\n\nThe game has some really nice aspects, for example the choice of four different characters, which play quite differently, a nice selection of towers, secondary weapons, and perks giving you advantages/disadvantages. I think you get these things too fast, which hinders motivation a bit and takes away the possibility to use all the new things you have obtained, as in the beginning you are rewarded with too many to try them all out. The progression is a bit off here. The game also is not too easy (which is positive, I have to add), you need to build a decent maze to survive. However you are quite limited, as you can only build on certain parts of the map. A positive point I found: You have two patches of ressources, bases and money. You use bases to build the maze, and money for the actual towers, sitting on top of the bases. Therefore you don't have to compromise between having a nice maze and having decent firepower, which is a great concept.\n\nMy direct comparison for this game are the Orcs must die-games, and those do most of the stuff in this game better. You don't build mazes in Orcs must die and have no shooter-aspect, but everything else is done equally good or better in my opinion; even the combat is more enjoyable there. If you don't mind the things I mentioned above and prefer the FPS-Shooter elements to Third-person action, give Sanctum 2 a try; otherwise avoid this and maybe think about getting Orcs must die, if you haven't already.","January 26, 2014","false","1.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It runs in a 3D environment and posseses a stylized aesthetics. Based on the peer 2 peer system, sanctum 2 allows you to play solo with a perfect ping or join existing rooms of other players that are set to public, with a max of 4 players per room. The game also has a unique and captivating story as well as characters for those who are interested in these things. The soundtrack aint half bad either.\n\nThis game offers a variety of gameplay styles due to the abundance of perks or passives and different types of towers both made available as you level up. This is accompanied by unique character classes that offer a specialized approach to gameplay. For example, Simo is a sniper class that has better accuracy (less spread of bullets), and deals more damage on weakspots. It is also possible to draw enemy attention or aggro by getting into their face, and the character Haigen Hawkins was designed with this in mind.\n\nOne thing to remember though is that this game is both a tower defense game and an fps. You can't go one way without the other and you will be rewarded for shooting the enemies where it hurts as well as being able to conceptualize the best tower placements. It's a thinking + shooting game, and one that I recommend.","February 5, 2014","true","97.3"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waywardwatergod/recommended/210770/","waywardwatergod","Teague Vox","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waywardwatergod/","350 products in account","Story: 2.5/5The general curse of an FPS game is lack of plot and Sanctum is very scarcely different. It will relay a comic book-style preamble before every encounter but you will mostly find yourself more worried about the map layout of the upcoming battle than the story itself and in the end I think most peopel aren't going to know the story behind the Core Guardians at all. Though those of you who do, aren't going to think it's anything to write home about - I didn't anyway.\n\nGameplay & Controls: 5/5Assuming you're using mouse and keyboard (because why would you use a game pad for a FPS...?) the control setup is what you might call standard, but it's called standard for a reason - it works. The pace of each map is always scaled perfectly in my opinion and each time you start a new encounter the difficulty scales well, whether you're playing with friends or on your own. I will say Sanctum will test you - even if you're the type to hunt up tower placement strategies with a little Google Fu you're still going to have to be up to snuff with your shooter skills - Sanctum 2 will send enemies that will reflect fire, take several minutes to take down, and can even destroy your towers from multiple directions. And while it's easy to predict what comes from where and what you should have readied in defense, a lot of the time the enemy AI isn't static. Which is a good thing. No stale battles here!\n\nMusic & Sound: 4/5While the menu music is a bit of a snooze the in game battle tunes really set a mood well - prog electro and D&B compliment Sanctum's futuristic theme perfectly. There are times with REX you will have to endure a plethora of stacked explosion sounds however as well as some of the tower and enemy sound effects.\n\nVisuals:  3.5/5The biggest gripe I have with how the game looks is in a few of the stages the lighting will be so intense it will seem like you're trying to engage in a staring contest with a star from 5 feet away through a magnifying glass though the environments, character and monster designs and weaponry of the game are beautiful. The menus and maps are nicely done as per the theme of the game though foregoing things like grass and physical damage for textures is a bit of a letdown, it's not too terribly noticable.\n\nOverall: 4/5Sanctum is a very unique blend of first person shooter and tower defense, and the first of it's kind even. There are even some bits and bobs of RPG thrown in there with the games leveling system, though they work really well. If you've played the original you'll note how much has improved in the series thus far and that gets a major amount of respect from me (mainly because I made the mistake of playing the second installment first and had to backpedal into something I felt really couldn't match up.) The highly customizable pre-battle outfittings and DLC maps and overall difficulty of the game (which can be augmented with Feats of Strength, which are kind of like handicaps and modifiers to make the difficulty even more trying) make it one I can constantly play over and over again. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a different kind of shooter.","November 4, 2014","true","53.4"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

I always felt helpless during the waves as I watch the enemies go through the defenses and I'd lose. I'm certain the developers had a train of thought similar to that when they made this game.\n\nSanctum 2 perked my interest, and I picked it up on sale. Without a doubt it is the best game purchase I have made so far this year. Every stage has countless strategies you can try on it. One can easily spend hours tinkering around with different tower strategies. On top of the countless tower strategies are character builds. With the variety of characters, guns, and perks one can create a character build that would suit their play style. The stages themselves are breathtaking. Each one has so many nooks and crannies to explore while building. Sometimes I pause between waves just to admire the scenery.\n\nThe game also has a simple, but interesting story with it that does a good job of fleshing out the world and characters.\n\nMy adivce to others is to definently play this game with others, it is much more enjoyable experience. That goes double for when you are playing with all 5 Feats of Strength. Beating stages with 5 FoS alone is a challenging endevor. Many hours I have spent trying to beat a single stage; the slightest slip up can force you to start over. Sometimes I even had to rethink my entire tower build. All together it can easily drive you insane. Honestly if it wasn't for the Tactical Juxaposition + Drone Launcher combination, I don't even think some of these stages are possible to beat with 5 FoS alone.\n\nI'll admit I have never played the original Sanctum, so I have nothing to compare it to, but from what I see the 'FPS' portion of this game takes a little more active role compared to the original.\n\nCoffee Stain Studios has done a fantastic job crafting this unique Tower Defense/FPS hybrid game.

I went to the store and noticed that Sanctum 2 was also out... and it was free to play for the weekend. I downloaded it, played a few rounds, and immediately bought it along with the DLC.\n\nI've played a few tower defense games in the past, but it's not exactly a genre that I'm super enthusiastic about. I'm also not a big FPS fan (especially online games), but there's just something abou Sanctum 2 that really pleases me. The game is challenging without being frustrating (so far, at least), and there seems to be a really nice sense of progression with the leveling system and tower/perk unlocks. I also really enjoy the added touch of the 'feats' that let you increase the difficulty for extra XP. Replaying older stages with new perks and feats gives you some decent replay value.\n\nThe game runs great, looks great, sounds great, and plays very smoothly. The online co-op is also a wonderful addition that really puts this game over the top. Sanctum 2 is pretty dang rad.","August 15, 2014","true","7.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

At this point in its history, Sanctum 2 is a brilliant hybrid FPS/tower defense game where success depends on good mazing, good tower placement and choice, and good FPS play. The strategy side is weighty and meaningful, the character perks and weapon choices carry significant impact, and in general planning is as or more important than moment-to-moment shooting skill.

There's more to it, because this game actually has a plot. It's pretty good, i'd say. A bit basic, but good.\n\nThe gameplay is fantastic. You build towers, and then you defend the core from the Lumes. But wait. The towers aren't doing all the work, YOU are helping out as well, you lazy twit. You get a good amount of weaponry to shoot the aliens with, and a variety of perks to bolster you and your defenses, and they vary from quite basic guns, to some pretty strange guns. And if you suck at aiming, don't worry. There are a few perks and guns that help counter that. You do have to do SOME aiming, ESPECIALLY in the last level of the first DLC.\n\nThe scenery is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gorgeous, and they didn't even put borders around the arena, so you are free to explore the area. Do watch your step, even more so when you are playing Sweet, because there are some bottomless pits. And blasting yourself in the wrong direction can very quickly end in some fund losses in hospital bills. Well, not really, you get to keep the money. You will just have some SEVERE pain in your legs for a while. You can walk it off.\n\nIf you are looking for more, there is a whole DLC campaign that continues where the base game leaves off. The quality varies quite a bit in terms of maps and towers, but all of them are pretty good. A gripe i have is that the AA tower, which you will NEED early on in the DLC, is locked behind rank 32. So you'll have to defend a bit untill then.\n\nSo yeah, Sanctum 2 is a pretty good game. Even more so if you play Co-oP. So, if you dig a strangely holy concoction\nof TD and FPS, i'd highly suggest you pick this one up.","December 31, 2015","true","35.7"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Drawn in immediately by the premise of a FPS turret defense game, I fell in love with the freedom to play how I wanted and the amazing aesthetics. This made it harder when Sanctum 1's glaring flaws creeped up on me (difficulty by simply ramping up numbers, scatter lazer spam and the inevitability of a stale and repetitive single or multiplater experience).\n\nWhen I saw Sanctum 2 announced, my hopes were high. Hoping for these issues adressed, I purchased immediatealy.\n\nIt did not dissapoint in the slightest.\n\nSanctum 2 fixed nearly every problem with sanctum 1. Substituting disorienting teleporters and tall towers for an easy to see and traverse envrioment on foot aided both combat, navigation, and tower planning. More unique and interesting towers, a selection of weapons to fit every playstyle, amazing graphics, complicated and entertaining enemies and a crazy fun perk system to keep everything fresh, Sanctum 2 is easily one of my favourite games of all time.\n\nEven those poor at FPS like me can still have fun using nearly every weapon. Combat is complicated, useful and necessary to survival. Planning mazes and tower setups is both easier and more effective, and honestly makes a lot more sense. Sanctum 2 is a perfect sequel: everything you loved, nothing you didnt. It demands more from the player, and in return removes the barriers that frustated you in meeting these demands previously.\n\nIt's hard to cram all my praise for this game into words. Grab a buddy or two and get playing. There's so much replay value.","November 20, 2015","true","84.2"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

However, Sanctum 2 is very much different than the first Sanctum. While Sanctum is 90% tower defense and 10% hero defense, Sanctum 2 is 50% tower defense and 50% hero defense. This means you can't just build-and-forget like the first Sanctum, where you just have to have enough decent towers and a well-made maze and you'll make it through the waves.\n\nIn Sanctum 2, you'll have to fire your guns just as often as your towers or you'll lose the wave. This makes for a more immersive game which requires more input and interaction from players, and proper strategies will determine the border between victory or annihilation. Not to mention you can get killed if the wave mobs get close to you.\n\nAdd a little RPG element to the mix where you get to select a character, equip his/her weapons, select your towers and skills obtained by leveling up, and you have yourself a semi-complex game that will keep you occupied for many hours and offers high replayability value.\n\nPick up a bunch of friends and buy the pack for this game, and you can't go wrong. Most definitely recommended, better than a lot of games currently in the market, and it is very affordable and worth the money.\n\nWithout a doubt, 8 out of 10.","November 15, 2015","true","3.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","2","2","2","0"

Then just click enter and start shooting the enemy creatures with your own guns.\n\nThat's a great mechanics and it didn't change since the first game. But there are some drastic changes which fans of the first Sanctum didn't enjoy: now the player is vulnerable to attacks, so mosters can kick your ♥♥♥ if your are a slowpoke. Moreover, some monsters are now aggressive and start chasing the player if he gets in range of their attack. Even more than that: blocks on top of which you place towers are now significantly lower than in the first game, so even if you are standing on top of a block, the monsters can still punch you right in the face!

Difficulty level is also customisable, instead of a traditional 'Easy - Medium - Hard - etc.' setup, this game employs the 'Feats of Strength' system, allowing you to customise how hard to make the game, options to increase enemy health, speed, and strength are all seperate, giving you a more gradual difficulty slope as you get more confident.\n\nMultiplayer is another fantastic part of this game, allowing you to create or join a server at the touch of a button. You can create a private server and invite your friends to it, or make a public one and fight alongside complete strangers, or browse the public server list and help other players.\n\nAs someone that's obtained every achievement for this game, I can say there is still plenty more this game has to offer, different loadouts to try, different tower combinations, different maze layouts, I now spend time on public servers, helping them to progress through the game and I'm always fascinated by all the new and interesting approaches to the levels that I'd never even considered in my playthrough.\n\nOverall, very well polished, very enjoyable game with loads of content and replayability.

I got the game since it was free, so I had nothing to lose. Now, this game is actually, a great game! The weapons turrets are cool, you level up and earn perks and weapons, you have classes to choose from, and you can play on Co-Op/Multiplayer. However, the weapon system feels a bit, weird. You use CTRL to aim, and the ammo system is weird, but if you've never played CoD or Battlefield, you could get used to this. Also, you have limited things to build, and you can kill yourself, just by placing one block down. Overall, this game is a great and fun game to play, but the weapons system is a bit weird.

The game is beautiful, I sometimes just run around taking screenshots its so pretty, I love the map designs and character designs especially. Multiplayer with someone you know is to be prefered, I personally can't enjoy a game when I'm lonely. The various towers and weapons given to you are fun and enjoyable to use, and every item has a purpose. Being a defender of the core, and building your own death maze to  murder  the invasive monsters, as your robot companion ask for coffee, is a very fun filled endeavor.  By far the best feature is the robot voice that speaks when you type to communicate to your team.  Combat has a sci-fi feel, and there is a very satisfying sound that emits from your rocket launcher as you squelch your enemies and are thrown by knockback. The easter eggs hidden in the game are a fun surprise to hunt for, and I loved the references I saw.  Overall, if you enjoy a strategic multiplayer game to play with your mates, pick up Sanctum 2 and place those tower bases.","January 9, 2014","true","24.2"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

You often lack the basic resources to have a small chance at defeating the massive hordes of enemies. While this is not a initially bad thing, as it is a TD/FPS hybrid, it stays that way throughout the entire mission. Difficulty does not seem to scale with the lack of players you have.\n\nThe tutorial is one of the worst I have seen, giving very little information about how to play the game or what anything on screen means.\n\nI can't say much about the story, as I haven't played the original.\n\nThe characters/weapons are okay at best. The only one I truly enjoyed playing was the sniper robot, because it is the most diverse. The Squad Leader character's weapon has too much recoil to be worth the shot (thank you, thank you, I'll be here all night).\n\nTL;DRSanctum 2: Yet another reason we need a in-between review button.","October 10, 2015","true","3.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","60","6","10","0","0"

Visually speaking, Sanctum 2 is crisper, cleaner and more up to date with graphics of newer games even though it was released in 2013. There were some changes to the tower building component as well as the use of personal weapons. In the original you built towers by spending resources, now you are given a number of towers to start with and can place them anywhere, with more towers given to you upon completion of each wave. This makes the challenge a little different as it may take a few waves to redirect the flow of enemies. The changes to personal weapons are that you now need to reload, as opposed to the auto-reload of the original. This makes it more realistic and presents challenge by forcing you to manage your ammunition.\n\nI thought Sanctum 2 took everything to the next level and was a great sequel from a pretty fun game. It has similar options to the first regarding single player or multiplayer, so if you enjoyed playing the original Sanctum you should really enjoy Sanctum 2.","October 2, 2015","true","0.9"," 20 of 38 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","20","38","5","1"

A very original game and in my opinion well worth the buy.

The enviroments were spectacular, and it was a generally good game.\n\nSanctum 2, is an improvement of almost all aspects. First off, the teleport barriers that warped you back to spawn if you walked too far are gone. Meaning you can now fully explore each enviroment between waves, and this is great, because Sanctum 2 is absolutely gorgeous!\n\nThe loadout system has been slightly tweaked too, employing a new Class based system with preset weapons, and perks too. These are all unlocked through a progressive levelling system, which rewards playing, but can also be a little annoying at times. I feel most people will find it restrictive, but i personally think it allows you to specialise your character better, which is important, because combat has a much bigger role in this iteration.\n\nTowers can get the job done, yes. But they are now also quite weaker, meaning if you want to hold off all waves you need to get down there yourself and take part in the fighting. Again, many will not enjoy this, and Tower Defence purists may be annoyed.\n\nPretty much the entire game has also been simplfied too. Towers now only have 3 levels, but you can insert more resources in order to "overcharge" them and increase their stats more. Weapon levelling is now gone, instead relying on your loadout more. Standard block towers and offensive towers themselves now take seperate resources, meaning you can now build an effective maze and not worry about running out of resources.\n\nAll in all, i thoroughly enjoy Sanctum 2, and highly recommend you purchase it if you own the first!","December 16, 2013","true","7.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The most essential elements of gameplay are explained in mouseover tooltips, and after that it's just you and your strategy versus wave after wave of very hostile aliens.\n\nCampaign storyline progress is provided in a comic book page style on each level's loading screen, and the levels start out pretty empty - it's up to you to decide how best to deploy your defenses based on what's coming next from the enemy direction.\n\nGameplay is balanced such that your towers don't quite dispatch all of the oncoming hostiles on their own - you'll need to go toe to toe with some heavy hitting bosses to keep your core safe.\n\nMultiple gameplay modes and difficulties make this game challenging enough to be satisfying without being too hard to enjoy. This game has the distinction of being one of the few I've ever played where death isn't ruinously frustrating - if you die, you wait ten seconds to respawn and you jump blazing back into the action.

With countless flash and mobile games that felt almost like carbon copies of each other, it had pretty much stagnated in my eyes. It looked as if the games I had once loved was dead.\n\nAnd then I discovered Sanctum.\n\nSure, the internet connection I had at the time made it impossible for me to play co-op online, but with what little FPS skill I could muster I made due, and I absolutely loved it.\n\nFlash-forward to late October 2013, when I found Sanctum 2 on sale. I immediately snapped it up and started playing, and I was far from dissapointed. Coffee Stain had used the 2 years between Sanctum and this game to truly make it worthy of being "the sequel to the world’s first Tower Defense/FPS hybrid game."\n\nFor those of you that played the original, the biggest difference by far is the new resource system, which now has seperate units for constructing the tower bases that outline the maze and the towers that shoot the creeps ("Lumes"). New characters open up brand new strategies for demolishing the relentless horde. Gone now are the teleporter towers, now made pretty much unnesesary by smaller, more focused maps. Recycling towers also gives you all the credits put into them now, with the option to revert to only getting half your resources back avaliable in the "Hardcore Mode" Feat of Strength, which also includes no respawn. There are other fairly large differences (was there a 15 tower limit in the original?), but I found that they, like the ones mentioned above, actually added to the fun of the game so much I didn't actually care.\n\nFor those of you who haven't played the original, this game is possibly the most rewarding co-op game I have ever played, effortlessly combining high-brow Tower Defence strategy with fast-paced, cooperative First Person Shooter action. So for those of you who, like me, became tired of simply observing your towers attempt to beat back the horde, come join us.

The weakspot mechanic and dumb-ish turret AI means you'll have to be active in protecting your base. Some consripts help as well, but most of the time you'll kill them yourself dropping bases on their heads to build towers on. Good thing they matter very little.\n\nThe Gameplay is fun, although it starts to get a bit repetitive some ways in. There is some enemy variety, in that new enemies are introduced periodically, however this game will also pull some "This is a bigger version of the enemy therefore it's more tough" nonesense. A 10 second respawn timer means that you can die multiple times and not fail the stage, while being able to traverse the paths you made for the enemies unhindered is something I derived great pleasure from. One can have a maximum number of turrets down per stage (15 for the first areas, I did not check to see if this number is constant until the end)\n\nThe environments are nicely varied, each arena tastefully made. You can get out of the minimap-charted area to find some secrets and bonuses, often manifesting in the form of gimmicky "easter eggs" (such as an alarm when you pass through a security gate on a certain stage) or mines, which can be laid down to help you stem the flow of enemies. They do great damage, but come in short supply.\n\nControls are nice and responsive, fully rebindable although the defaults are quite fine. Graphics are decent, though the enemy palette is a tad lacking, as lots of enemies share the same colours, and every enemy has a primary colour that covers 90% of their bodies. However, there are some nice details and the models themselves are quite unique. Each one also has its own little neat mechanic, and the good animations means you'll know what's about to happen if you get too close to them. No instant-kill enemies, as far as I can tell.\n\nThe game also has bosses on each area, that add another layer of challenge. Some bosses can break your structures, which sounds furstrating, but the wave ends once you defeat them, so it's not really an issue. I haven't played much, but I liked what I saw thus far. Killing with the guns on offer is satisfying, as they all have some sort of weight behind them, and the guns are nicely varied, each with alt-fire and ADS / Zoom. Perks and secondary weapons add to that, and the fact that you can reload a weapon and switch to the other before the reload is done without cancelling it means that the action is non-stop.\n\nHowever: The game has 4 classes. Out of those, only the shotgunner and the assault rifle girl seem viable. This is because some enemies have weakspots in akward places that require manuevring to hit, and/or a lot of life, therefore the sniper bot and the rocket launcher girl have trouble being effective as you'll have to step in the enemies' way and take damage to try to take some of them down. Enemies have health scaling in multiplayer, making the game impossible unless you're in a coordinated team. You can also grief your teammates by breaking their barriers ect., however unless the time runs out, only by all members being ready can the wave come forth, which gives enough time to catch them out. This however also shows another small flaw: Unless you communicate, you're all going to have different designs for the level in mind, and you're not going to agree and you're going to end up with something suboptimal. With health scaling on enemies according to number of players, this can lead to you losing incredibly easily. The towers available sort of lack variety. "This is the standard run-of-the-mill turret. This kills weak, fast guys quickly. This kills strong, slowish guys quickly." The player does not get enough money to liberally play with it and explore all their options, as by the end of the stage you'll probably have filled the area with level one turrets to cover all entrances, and never upgrade more than ~2, which is a shame because some of the upgraded turrets look really cool. Some turrets, like the mine spawning one, are just too bad to ever be used, as it does not confer an active benefit, since mines are a "get out of jail free card" when you're being overrun, and others like the AoE "good vs groups" turret is only good on certain waves, and not in multiplayer as turret damage does not scale well and most small buggers will zip right past. Progression is a tad slow, and you cannot see the various enemies you've faced in the levels in a Bestiary or something except for playing that level again or progressing. You can see the story slides though.\n\nI am not a fan of the genre. I feel that some potential has been wasted by not allowing the player to use the "conscripts" along with the towers for defense. But for only 2,24 Euros, or 3,44 if you want all the DLC, the game certainly has enough gameplay hours to keep you occupied if you like the concept behind it. While the characters themselves are not too memorable and the story weak-ish, the gameplay makes up for it. Great with a friend where you can communicate and cooperate. I don't think I'd get it at full price, but it's worth considering when it's on sale.\n","August 17, 2014","true","2.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's very easy to drop in and out of a game or to invite other players into your own, and you'll never get stuck using a class you don't care for because the other three were taken.  The only downside to the multiplayer is that the chat is not easily accessible nor is it helpful when you're actually playing, even during the slow-paced build phases, but using a voice chat or being in the same room as the rest of your team is far better.

You have a build phase during which you build your maze and deploy or upgrade tower weapons. This whole process is much more streamlined than the original game. Once your team is happy with the set up you activate the wave. Then it is shoot to kill using your own personal weapons. This part of the game is also more satisfying than the original because there seems to be less clumping of the enemies and therefore less "Blast away without aiming" style gun play. The game is certainly well equipped to provide many evenings of inexpensive fun for a group of friends.","August 30, 2014","true","6.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Unlike a lot of games that try to combine TD with another genre, one style tends to fall short of the other in terms of importance to game content and/or quality. That is not the case in Sanctum.

It's very easy to drop in and out of a game or to invite other players into your own, and you'll never get stuck using a class you don't care for because the other three were taken.  The only downside to the multiplayer is that the chat is not easily accessible nor is it helpful when you're actually playing, even during the slow-paced build phases, but using a voice chat or being in the same room as the rest of your team is far better.

Plays well, and looks and sounds very - sometimes incredibly - pritty. It's got its places where you just stop to look ore listen, you know.\nMaybe even a bit like made for girls. Yet i, as a 100% male do recommend it to everyone)).\nIt's got a generous variety of towers, guns, perks and 5 characters to play as, though i mostly played as Simo with sniper and assault rifles, good against all around towers like cannon, violator and focus(and one AA, if needed) and all three core-saving perks.\nBeat its campaign as a singleplayer, now looking forward to a playthrough in a party. Ain't managed to complete everything with all feats of strength enabled, 1\3 or more are still to be beat on hardest difficulty along with the half of the achievements to be... achieved. It gets real tough sometimes or demands more idea about perks and towers than i've got for now, maybe. I think i've actually played it only half of the time recorded and about half of the time i played were failed replays on hardest.  And that didn't get too boring very fast.  So It's very involving and replayable.  Though i'd recommend not to try to break this game's neck replaying too many times in succession when it doesn't let you win a mission with all feats of strength enabled. That's how it becomes a time-waster.\nMany thanks to Coffee Stain, i'll even think about purchasing that goat-simulator, damn it)). Right after i kick that BliskeBlaske(or whatever it's name) big flying rear part with all 5 FoS on)) or maybe sooner. Should you ever be planning to make more Sanctum games, please think about a shooter-slasher with much more passable space full of that beautiful alien nature, reids deep into the jungle, exploring abandoned settlements, attacks on the lumes' nests etc. With the same TD elements and perks, but optional - like a smaller core and some tower-bases and tower-guns dropped to support the team of characters and simo-units on a mission with the balance not crucially depending on fortifications. Could be great to play too. After all - we're not gonna give the whole planet back to lumes, right?))","April 7, 2014","true","761.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have a build phase during which you build your maze and deploy or upgrade tower weapons. This whole process is much more streamlined than the original game. Once your team is happy with the set up you activate the wave. Then it is shoot to kill using your own personal weapons. This part of the game is also more satisfying than the original because there seems to be less clumping of the enemies and therefore less "Blast away without aiming" style gun play.

Great idea but it falls between two stools: the shooting doesn't feel great and the tower defence part is a bit fiddly in first person. Also it's really designed for co-op play. Single player is frustrating with useless bots who will not fire on enemies even though they're right near them. It also defaults to making games public so if you don't want randoms joining in, turn it off. Great presentation, lots of customisation and options, but playing it on my own has been frustrating and a tad underwhelming, I'm afraid. Get some friends in if you do get this.

But once you've hit the lv20ish range, chances are you'll have made your way to the more interesting maps and have plenty of stuff in your arsenal. The DLC also provides quite a few good maps that I liked better than the originals, along with two new towers in most of them.\n\nAside from the relatively slow leveling curve, there isn't really anything to complain about. Obviously it's better to play with others but luckily usually someone else who's made their way into at least the mid-teens knows what's going on and will recognize a good setup, so arguments over tower placement aren't an issue or at least haven't been much of one for me. Aside from some pair of two year-olds that muted me and wouldn't dare let me touch their sacred wall segments where they hadn't even placed turrets. Every game has some ♥♥♥♥♥♥s playing it, I suppose.\n\nIf you think whatever resources you're given after each wave are 'yours' then either drop the greedy mentality or don't even bother playing this game with anyone but yourself.","May 21, 2013","true","28.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The first Sanctum was a very good game in my opinion, but it had its shortcomings, most of which were remedied here in the sequel.  The new class system is so fantastic!  A TF2 addict like myself is going to love the classes.  The ability to jump over  your walls is very handy!  In the first Sanctum, you needed those lousy elevator whatcha-ma-call-ems to get over them.  The new character perk system trumps the old weapon upgrading system.  Who wants to have to deal with that each round? Jeez, I just want a simple layout, I'm here to shoot stuff! This sequel let's you focus your time on the towers, rather than having to allocate funds toward weapons each round.  One thing I really enjoy about S2 is that they give you just a small amount of towers each round instead of a bunch at the beginning.  This  has made co-op much quicker, and makes it seem more like a cooperative effort.  Believe me, the bickering about towers in the old Sanctum were so annoying.  There was always that "artist" who wanted to create some amazing design, and it would take them FOREVER to finish it.\nBuy this game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ximenes/recommended/210770/","ximenes","Naked Wolf","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ximenes/","220 products in account","As a fan of the original Sanctum, playing this game can feel a little weird. Firstly, you're far more limited on towers, with you starting off only being able to deploy/upgrade 1 kind of tower and can get a max of 4 as you progress. You also only have 2 weapons. Before you had a giant blank canvas to develop into a maze of towers with your core WAY off at the end, now your core is almost in the middle of things. So if you've developed tactics from the first game, they won;t fly in this one. Instead of a ton of towers, you're better off with a few that get a lot of upgrades. And instead of only really needing to shoot a few special enemies, now you're gonna be in the thick of it, so pick your weapons carefully.\n\nHonetly, from what I've seen this game takes Sanctum in a direction that it seemed to be heading for anyway. The first was almsot all about tower placement and maze formation, while this game gives the FPS elements more of the spotlight. The two work well together despite what you'd think, and it adds a level of tactical gameplay with the limiting of towers and weapons not to mention character selection since each has their own signiture weapon and defauly bonuses.","December 8, 2013","true","1.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Plays well, and looks and sounds very - sometimes incredibly - pritty. It's got its places where you just stop to look ore listen, you know.\nMaybe even a bit like made for girls. Yet i, as a 100% male do recommend it to everyone)).\nIt's got a generous variety of towers, guns, perks and 5 characters to play as, though i mostly played as Simo with sniper and assault rifles, good against all around towers like cannon, violator and focus(and one AA, if needed) and all three core-saving perks.\nBeat its campaign as a singleplayer, now looking forward to a playthrough in a party. Ain't managed to complete everything with all feats of strength enabled, 1\3 or more are still to be beat on hardest difficulty along with the half of the achievements to be... achieved. It gets real tough sometimes or demands more idea about perks and towers than i've got for now, maybe. I think i've actually played it only half of the time recorded and about half of the time i played were failed replays on hardest.  And that didn't get too boring very fast.  So It's very involving and replayable.  Though i'd recommend not to try to break this game's neck replaying too many times in succession when it doesn't let you win a mission with all feats of strength enabled. That's how it becomes a time-waster.\nMany thanks to Coffee Stain, i'll even think about purchasing that goat-simulator, damn it)). Right after i kick that BliskeBlaske(or whatever it's name) big flying rear part with all 5 FoS on)) or maybe sooner. Should you ever be planning to make more Sanctum games, please think about a shooter-slasher with much more passable space full of that beautiful alien nature, reids deep into the jungle, exploring abandoned settlements, attacks on the lumes' nests etc. With the same TD elements and perks, but optional - like a smaller core and some tower-bases and tower-guns dropped to support the team of characters and simo-units on a mission with the balance not crucially depending on fortifications. Could be great to play too. After all - we're not gonna give the whole planet back to lumes, right?))","April 7, 2014","true","761.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Taking place in a futuristic world, join with up to 3 other people (4 player co-op) to defend waves after waves of the biggest bunch of bugs you've probably seen lately. Featuring a large vareity of towers, weapons and perks across multiple maps, Sanctum 2 is definately a game to look at. Multiple types of enemies will force you to think of new innovative strategies to stop them from destorying your core, accompanied by a well-designed world and characters.\nThe game also has a leveling system that will motivate you to keep playing in order to open new stages, and also allows you to set higher or lower difficulties if you feel the game is too easy/hard. (And believe, it can be VERY hard)\nThe story is quite dull and there is a lot of DLC, and a few balancing issues still exist, but still, Sanctum 2 is definately one of the best tower-defense games out there, so you don't want to miss on that classic.\n\nSo get ready!

Feats of strength are there when you fancy a challenge and the comic style story clips make this game unique, to think it is an indie game amazes me.

The base game features 4 playable "classes" each sporting a signature weapon that go with the characters strengths for instance there is a Shotgun wielder and because a shotgun requires you to be upclose and personal the character gets a higher health than the other characters. In the DLC they add a new "class" who sports a crossbow, last bolt in the clip does extra damage, hard concept to wrap your head around but it works. The game itself is....well the best way i can describe it is if you mixed a tower defence game with a FPS, multiple towers to unlock, multiple weapons to unlock including ones from the other classes, you level up in this game unlocking new stuff as you go. Perks, Towers, and weapons are the 3 categories you can unlock from Perks as with any other perk in a FPS increases a stat or gives you a bonus thats active all the time, for instance in one unlock you get a perk that if you jump on an enemy's head you deal extra damage to them, theres also ones to increase movement speed, make your jumps higher, resistances higher, and even a perk to make you deal damage to enemies who are close to you. the Towers range from damage towers like Lightning, Slow towers and theres even some Mine towers that you must set up yourself. There are a wide array of enemies that come through during the waves each enemy has a weak spot that makes you deal more damage when you shoot it, some are easy to find and some take some searching to find, but it is highly recommended you do so from the get go. Levels too easy? add Feats of Strength to your mobs for added difficulty there are 5 Feats ranging from reduced damage to having them heal per second. Want just 1 perk cool want all 5 go for it or any in between. The game does start to feel repetitive after awhile and some of the Waves seem almost impossible even with 3 players but the fun you get while playing makes this game a must buy for any library. I would however wait for the next sale before buying.","March 8, 2014","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Sanctum 2 has much more limited maze design opportunities but adds Borderlands-style class mechanics with perks, different loadouts, etc.   This changed the game a lot which seems to have upset a lot of Sanctum 1 purists.  However, the changes actually justify the sequel since they amount to a huge overhaul of the game and not simply a slight modification of the original.\n\nThe game is designed well, controls well, and runs pretty well.  I've had very occasional glitches but it's better than par for the most part.\n\nSanctum 2 ends up being much more fun in multiplayer than singleplayer - so much so that I'd really only recommend getting it if you have a friend or two to play with.  That said, it is REALLY fun in mutliplayer and since you can often pick it up for $5 per copy, it's great value.","February 19, 2015","true","77.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This game is so good. It expands on many of the features of the first game and feels more like an actual game, rather than a bunch of maps to select from. In order to unlock new towers, you need to level up by playing through the maps and gaining exp from killing sh*t, which is a great featureso you feel as though you are getting stronger along with your foes (but it's done in a way that you can still get the crap beaten out of your core and lose, despite your shiny new towers), and the devs even added in a perk feature, which I didn't feel was needed until I used it and fell in love with it. You can unlock more perk slots and equip up to 4 at the beginning of each map, and holy crap they're awesome. The perks range from increasing the damage inflicted on enemy weakspots (I always equip that one), to having the core regain 10% of it's max health after each round, to you shooting lightning out of your body or jumping on an enemy and inflicting 2000 damage (Plumber Shoes ftw) or even increasing the amount of damage you inflict by 15% for every enemy near you. These perks are an amazing addition, and are super fun and add a bunch of variety to each game you play (especially on co-op, with each player equipping different perks).\nNow if you read that and are thinking, "Hmmm.... Sounds like I'm going to be overpowered.... Especially on co-op," and you couldn't be more WRONG. The game is really tough, as the towers now do less damage than in the first game and you have to play a larger role in combatting the hordes of mobs you will find in this game. One moment you're on top of the world, your maze is obliterating everything, and the next you have a giant Super Heavy blowing up your towers (and yes, certain boss enemies can destroy your towers, but they can be repaired for free after the round) and a huge swarm of walker pups are attacking your core. Something about the constant switch from success to failure makes the game really addicting, and can you keep playing when you could've rage quit earlier, simply because THIS turret layout is going to work, forget the four you built before. This is the one, and thats what keeps you going.\nI haven't completed the game's campaign, or come anywhere near unlocking all the perks (I'm only level 12 out of 50 I think), mainly cuz I only play this game for hour bursts when I want to blow off steam after work or whatever (sometimes i binge and play for longer; 6 hours straight was the longest I could go before getting off and that was so I could go to work), and that's exactly what this game is made for. The original was good, but a lot of the maps were too long requiring you to beat 20 or 25 long waves of enemies before completing the map. In this game there are 8 (with all the DLC) regions, each one with about 4 or 5 maps inside of it (which is a lot of content), and each map contains about 10-15 waves which is a lot easier to get through than 20 or 25 in the original. Because of this the maps change often enough to stay interesting and visually appealing (they're all beautifully designed and full of little secrets like playable arcade games), and the graphics are really breath taking as the environments go from clean cities, to rusted out junkyards and train stations, to beautiful, alien forests (and more areas I haven't seen before) which are completely gorgeous on the Unreal engine this game uses.\nAs you've noticed earlier, I've been comparing this game to the original which I'm assuming you've already played. If not buy both of them and play them now (there's no story in the first game, so if you can only afford one, buy this one). If you were a fan of the original but read negative reviews saying the game is watered down and dumber, that is 100% untrue. Out of the entire game I can find only 1 issue, which is when you upgrade the cannon tower that tower does less than DPS than if you just bought another cannon and put it by the first one. Other than that though, the game is improved in every way. Graphically, the first game was really nice for an indy game with burnt out cities and gorgeous jungles, but this game takes the cake. Gameplay-wise, this game is far superior. It feels like a spectacular molding of excellant FPS gameplay mixed with tower defense and not TD with FPS thrown in as a novelty or vice versa. Story, the second one actually has a story now, told through little entertaining comic strips that are shown as each map loads. I haven't gotten far in the story at all, but so far so good. It's not the focus of the game, but it's nice to see all the playable characters interacting and learn some backstory on the Lumes (the enemies you'll face) and Elysion One. Music: As an owner of the Sanctum 1 soundtrack, I have to admit the first game has better music, but the music in 2 is still very strong and very good. However it is one of those soundtracks you dont notice, which a lot of people consider to be the best type, so it's good.\nOverall, I recommend this game to anyone with a PC and a love for gaming. It's that good. It requires the fast reflexes and thinking of a well-made shooter (not COD), but also the calculating logic of a TD, and the creativity of building games. I may not be the most qualified to write this review, as I stated before, I'm not far in the game, but there is just so much content and so far it is all so good I can't help but write this review now, so others will dive into the world of Elysion One and kick more Lume a$$. I'll probably edit this review (if i can) when I complete this game, but as of now I am currently having a love affair with this game.\n\nWould Recommend in an instant.\n10/10","February 14, 2014","true","49.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'm sure all gamers have at some point played a tower defense style game, but I have never seen a spin on it quite like this, it throws in the aspect of being a FPS, you have a character who gains experience and levels with each completed mission, leveling up increases you abilities and unlocks more weapons skills and slots for the like. Each map you start out by building walls and towers to defend your core, after you build with what you have availible you start the wave, so it still requires the strategy of funneling your enemies through mazes but also gives you the ability to run around and fight yourself. With the addition of boss battles it makes it more than the typical tower defence, the bosses have the power to smash your walls and towers which makes things more of a challenge, but the ability for 4 player co op lets you call for backup if you need a hand, Great game, decent price, lots of fun.

It's a mix of a tower defense game with a first person shooter. You place tower bases to create a path that the monsters will follow. Then you can put machine guns, turrets, etc. on the tower bases. When the monsters come in, instead of letting the turrets do everything, you play as a character of your choice and shoot the monsters as well.

But once you've hit the lv20ish range, chances are you'll have made your way to the more interesting maps and have plenty of stuff in your arsenal. The DLC also provides quite a few good maps that I liked better than the originals, along with two new towers in most of them.\n\nAside from the relatively slow leveling curve, there isn't really anything to complain about. Obviously it's better to play with others but luckily usually someone else who's made their way into at least the mid-teens knows what's going on and will recognize a good setup, so arguments over tower placement aren't an issue or at least haven't been much of one for me. Aside from some pair of two year-olds that muted me and wouldn't dare let me touch their sacred wall segments where they hadn't even placed turrets.

The first Sanctum was a very good game in my opinion, but it had its shortcomings, most of which were remedied here in the sequel.  The new class system is so fantastic!  A TF2 addict like myself is going to love the classes.  The ability to jump over  your walls is very handy!  In the first Sanctum, you needed those lousy elevator whatcha-ma-call-ems to get over them.  The new character perk system trumps the old weapon upgrading system.  Who wants to have to deal with that each round? Jeez, I just want a simple layout, I'm here to shoot stuff! This sequel let's you focus your time on the towers, rather than having to allocate funds toward weapons each round.  One thing I really enjoy about S2 is that they give you just a small amount of towers each round instead of a bunch at the beginning.  This  has made co-op much quicker, and makes it seem more like a cooperative effort.  Believe me, the bickering about towers in the old Sanctum were so annoying.  There was always that "artist" who wanted to create some amazing design, and it would take them FOREVER to finish it.\nBuy this game.

The guys that made Goat Simulator made this game first, and it sure is a gem that should be played by everyone. I love how it uses the tower defense genre simultaneously with some first-person shooter gameplay, and without any of the clutter many games like Orcs Must Die and PVZ: Garden Warefare have shown. There's some basic class customization that's simple but changes each level's approach immensely. Also, multiplayer is awesome, especially in later levels where teamwork is key to victory. I didn't buy the DLC, but I know I should have since it unlocks tons of valuable features that are definitely worth the extra cash. Hilarious and interactive easter eggs can be found all over the normal looking levels too. One level actually has a full-on arcade in the sky where you can play mini-games, it's awesome.

The base game features 4 playable "classes" each sporting a signature weapon that go with the characters strengths for instance there is a Shotgun wielder and because a shotgun requires you to be upclose and personal the character gets a higher health than the other characters. In the DLC they add a new "class" who sports a crossbow, last bolt in the clip does extra damage, hard concept to wrap your head around but it works. The game itself is....well the best way i can describe it is if you mixed a tower defence game with a FPS, multiple towers to unlock, multiple weapons to unlock including ones from the other classes, you level up in this game unlocking new stuff as you go. Perks, Towers, and weapons are the 3 categories you can unlock from Perks as with any other perk in a FPS increases a stat or gives you a bonus thats active all the time, for instance in one unlock you get a perk that if you jump on an enemy's head you deal extra damage to them, theres also ones to increase movement speed, make your jumps higher, resistances higher, and even a perk to make you deal damage to enemies who are close to you. the Towers range from damage towers like Lightning, Slow towers and theres even some Mine towers that you must set up yourself. There are a wide array of enemies that come through during the waves each enemy has a weak spot that makes you deal more damage when you shoot it, some are easy to find and some take some searching to find, but it is highly recommended you do so from the get go. Levels too easy? add Feats of Strength to your mobs for added difficulty there are 5 Feats ranging from reduced damage to having them heal per second. Want just 1 perk cool want all 5 go for it or any in between. The game does start to feel repetitive after awhile and some of the Waves seem almost impossible even with 3 players but the fun you get while playing makes this game a must buy for any library. I would however wait for the next sale before buying.","March 8, 2014","true","8.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I'll begin with the part for those who played the first.\n\nIf You Played the First Sanctum:\nBuy this. If you had any fun on it, buy this. The addition of player health, ammunition, and maximum limit on blocks might be a turn off, and I know it was for me. Nonetheless, I bought it on a sale, because why not? I was not disappointed. After completing the game, I can say with certainty that this game is far superior to the last one. Trust me, buy it.\n\nFor Those New to the Series:\nSanctum 2 is the sequel to the popular game Sanctum, a tower defense game taken to a new direction. It combined FPS elements with tower defense and strategy, as you built mazes to slow progress of monsters travelling on the shortest route to reach the Core, your point of protection. You played down with the blocks/towers, shooting the enemies, sometimes enabling the towers to do damage to them (since a small number of them required to be hit with high damage in a small area to be able to be hit by towers). It was very fun (for me), and I spent hours on it with friends. This game adds restrictions to the maze building system, making it more balanced and fair. It also has new characters, weapons, abilities, enemies, maps, and gameplay improvements. Watch a few videos on YouTube, and if it seems like your cup of tea, buy it, you won't regret it.","June 29, 2015","true","24.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It enhances upon the original mechanics rather than just deliver new content with no variation.  Staring at the core doesn't make your PC go "ow whyyyyyy" as much as it did in the first, camping on the walls isn't as sound a strategy which makes things a bit more challenging and engaging, a lot more diversity in weapons and abilities, bosses add some great "shake-ups" to gameplay, and overall the entire formula just feels optimized.\n\nThe only thing that I feel is just uninteresting is the story.  It's just pointless, I don't care about it.  It all looks pretty and has great aesthetics but the story and character interactions are meh.

I'll begin with the part for those who played the first.\n\nIf You Played the First Sanctum:\nBuy this. If you had any fun on it, buy this. The addition of player health, ammunition, and maximum limit on blocks might be a turn off, and I know it was for me. Nonetheless, I bought it on a sale, because why not? I was not disappointed. After completing the game, I can say with certainty that this game is far superior to the last one. Trust me, buy it.\n\nFor Those New to the Series:\nSanctum 2 is the sequel to the popular game Sanctum, a tower defense game taken to a new direction. It combined FPS elements with tower defense and strategy, as you built mazes to slow progress of monsters travelling on the shortest route to reach the Core, your point of protection. You played down with the blocks/towers, shooting the enemies, sometimes enabling the towers to do damage to them (since a small number of them required to be hit with high damage in a small area to be able to be hit by towers). It was very fun (for me), and I spent hours on it with friends. This game adds restrictions to the maze building system, making it more balanced and fair. It also has new characters, weapons, abilities, enemies, maps, and gameplay improvements. Watch a few videos on YouTube, and if it seems like your cup of tea, buy it, you won't regret it.","June 29, 2015","true","24.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I also typically don't like tower defense, and while this game is an exception, it also means I'll probably miss the finer points that a TD nerd would happily point out.  The 7300+ positive reviews massively outweighing the 700+ negative reviews should probably tell you something.\n\nThe graphics are simple, clean, and flashy, and what little voice acting there is is pretty well done.  Unlike the previous title this game has an actual story, told through comic-style  stills inebetween levels.  While I wrote better dialogue when I was in high school, it was nice to have some kind of setting, something a lot of tower defense games don't bother with.\n\nEach character has a different passive ability.  There are eventually 20 towers total, 16 weapons, which with enough levels, can be swapped out to any pair on a single character.  There are also 63 perks altogether.  Some of these items are only obtained through the DLC.  Altogether, the DLC effectively doubles the size of the game, so even if they didn't contain weapons and perks are absolutely worth getting.\n\nMany different synergies exist between the combination of equipped towers, weapons, and perks.  The game supports up to 4 players, and everyone has their own loadouts and resources, but they share the same tower limit from single player.\n\nSpeaking of that, the game can be very challenging to solo.  I was stuck on some maps for hours, but I persevered.  The balance is reflected in the fact that only once or twice did I have to grind out some levels for a tower or weapon to make enough difference for me to get past certain areas.  Even then it was probably unnecessary.\n\nOnce you're done with that, up to five "feats of strength" can be enabled per level to increase xp and make the game tougher.  At its most basic, expect to get stuck on half a dozen of the game's levels, and, like Dark Souls, expect a generous rush when you complete a level you were sure was impossible to solo.\n\nThe game isn't perfect, but I would pay full price for the total package.","September 24, 2015","true","75.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I like being a player inside a tower defense game and would recommend Orcs Must Die 2 or Dungeon Defenders over this one.  Sanctum 2 isn't bad, in fact it is good, just there are games out there with similar gameplay elements that are better.  If someone were committed to the space/future theme over the magic/fantasy theme, the mechanical/technical feel of Sanctum 2 might appeal to them more, though I feel the Halo-clone enemies in Sanctum 2 lose out in how they lack the whimsy of fighting hordes of cartoony goblins as one does in Orcs Must Die 2.","December 21, 2014","true","4.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The guys that made Goat Simulator made this game first, and it sure is a gem that should be played by everyone. I love how it uses the tower defense genre simultaneously with some first-person shooter gameplay, and without any of the clutter many games like Orcs Must Die and PVZ: Garden Warefare have shown. There's some basic class customization that's simple but changes each level's approach immensely. Also, multiplayer is awesome, especially in later levels where teamwork is key to victory. I didn't buy the DLC, but I know I should have since it unlocks tons of valuable features that are definitely worth the extra cash. Hilarious and interactive easter eggs can be found all over the normal looking levels too. One level actually has a full-on arcade in the sky where you can play mini-games, it's awesome.

You also unlock more as you rank up and can gain more xp with applying buffs (feats of strength) to give you bonus XP. Before the waves start you run around building the blocks/foundations and then spend money to build the towers you've equipped in the loadout or upgrade them. Then you start the wave and while the towers you built are doing their job you just run around blowing up alien-like creatures and gunning them down.\n\nI love TD games/maps and this is really fun! Even better I got this for $3 USD on the Lunar sale instead of $15.  Still worth it either way, though. It's a must-buy, especially at sale price.\n\nPros:\n-Fun as fun can be\n-Graphics are decent and pretty, nice environment and textures.\n-Running around blowing things up while towers work is fun.\n-Maze maze maze.\n-Heaps of perks and towers to unlock.\n-Can play solo, co-op or online. Private or public.\n-Bosses can smash your towers so prioritise them or build empty blocks on the outer perimeter.\n\nCons:\n-Difficulty scaling isn't perfect. I'm not sure if it scales with more players if you play online/co-op. Starting levels were quite hard, middle levels quite easy,\n-Needs more content, although the game is cheap.\n-Repetitive like most TD games, not too[/] much though, just that there's not much different strats you can do, although tactical juxtaposition perk can change things up a bit.","February 6","true","38.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

In contrast to Dungeon Grinders.. I mean Defenders, Sanctum eschews the farming and looting in favor of straight game play.  It does have experience and levels, but they're mostly a minor annoyance.  Like DD, the first person shooter element isn't strongly emphasized as the enemies are all very predictable and tower placement usually dominates your chances of success.\n\nWhere Sanctum really shines is the point after you've beaten the normal levels by randomly throwing down some towers and running wildly around blasting everything.  Flip on all the bad guy boosts and suddenly you have a very serious co-op puzzle game.  Which perks to take, what guns, and how to lay out your towers become hard questions, with different answers for every map.  Climbing the leaderboard becomes a competitive challenge.\n\nIf you enjoy cooperatively solving hard optimization problems, I strongly recommend Sanctum 2 with a friend.\n\nSanctum 2 does have some weak points.  The experience/level system just gets in the way and should've been scrapped.    There are too many perks and even when you know them all, it can be hard to find the one you want.  Number of players scaling is sometimes a factor.  Hoard avoided this by having specific maps for specific numbers of players.  Sanctum tries to pretend boosting the health of enemies is close enough.  It isn't and it makes leaderboard comparisons problematic.  The mind control tower introduced in the dlc substantially changes the game and ruins the leaderboard for people without the dlc.  The developers should've had separate ladders for dlc and without.","February 11, 2014","true","114.9"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Overall this game is a fun experience and really needs to be mentioned more this game gets my rating of 5/5\n","April 27, 2014","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Maybe game designers/developers would deepen that functionality to get hardcore-die-hard Sanctum 2 fans.\n-The comic style to tell you the story. As an old school gamer, really liked it.\n-Re-playability. Remember i mentioned Civilisation, and Heroes of M & M? Those are re-playable as hell, and everytime you get satisfaction having wasted time on them. Sanctum 2 brings the same feeling.\n-It is on current Humble Bundle. Come on, you know its a great way to get steam games. I can't wait for my friends to get it, so we can defeat that Feats-of-Strentg Campaign Mode together. Which leads to:\n-Very satisfying multiplayer experience, even after played with some steam-mushkin-power-gamer random punks, i can say that you get the satisfaction of watching your efforts helping the team. As well as your feats.\n\nBut to be fair, here come the things i think should be polished:\n-The guards. How come you got no feasible way of saving them? Why cant i send them all to the core or some secure position? Maybe in campaign if you are fanatical enough about their safety can save them, but definitively, not on survival. Believe me, every gamer dad/mom that play this game want to save the guards. The player should have the option anyways. Such a rant for those useless guards, huh?

In Sanctum 2 the challenge level is increased, giving the player less resources after each wave and removing the ability to upgrade weapons with resources, forcing the player to focus less on weapon damage and instead on carefully placed towers, walls and turrets to keep the enemy waves back, as well as the addition of a timer to mix things up and make the waves more chaotic.\nWith an immersive campaign mode playable in both single player or coop, Sanctum 2 offers mind-blowing gameplay complimented with a level-up system that rewards the player with unlockable towers, weapons and perks as well as a digital comic that offers insight into Sanctum's world which reveals a page or two before every stage.\nSanctum 2 is a direct upgrade to Sanctum, and is well worth the time for any fans of the original.","June 8, 2013","true","13.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrakeMallard/recommended/210770/","DrakeMallard","Drake Mallard","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DrakeMallard/","276 products in account","Sanctum 2, a first person shooter tower defence game with a good variety of enemies, weapons, towers. The game doesn't really take itself too serious and has a bit of humour in it, an example could be either the little tiny walkers (enemy type) that are having a beach day or "Gandalf".\n\nThe maps are build to not only help you think more creatively, but also test you. Think it's too easy? Then try adding some "Feats of Strenght" that is sure to spice up your gameplay (Feats gives enemies different kinds of bonuses such as extra health). Find the game too hard? Then try easy mode! Of course wouldn't be a tower defence game without survival mode now would it? Some maps might be dissapointing due to the lack of ability to make huge and complex mazes, other maps can and will again make more than enough up for that.\n\nYour own prefference on how to play: There are four different characters (five with the DLCs) all with their own unique abilities, different towers to choose from, an interessting perk system, weapons and of course you may build your own complex maze either by yourself or with your friends or if you don't have any like me then with random people online.\n\nThe graphics are a different kind of artstyle that may not be too appealing to everyone but it will by far not hinder any enjoyment out of gameplay. Personally was I in doubt to buy the game because of the artstyle, ended up loving it.\n\nNot sure what else to say, shouldn't make this too long anyway. Great game, defiently recommend it.","December 7, 2013","true","74.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Single player is really boring.\n\nGreat game, worth picking up if less than 4€\n\nThis game gets 6/10","April 11, 2014","true","2.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TIZexion/recommended/210770/","TIZexion","[T.I.] Zexion","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TIZexion/","159 products in account","I have mixed feelings about this game. I still recommend you buy it, especially if you played the first game, but let's go over a few new details. In Sanctum 1, it was all about the towers and a lovely first person tower defense game...however, in Sanctum 2 there are tons of changes from the first game that make it more of a challenge and overall different feel compared to the first game. You get a limit on how many towers can place, they cost more, they are harder to upgrade, and it relies on you to kill most of the enemies with the towers as support instead of vice versa from the original game. To me, I had to rethink and form almost completely new strategies for this game. That being said, it is still a fantastic, albeit difficult, game. The maps are all new with beautiful design to them, and many of which can allow you to go back and play them again by creating a new path they may be better than your original to lead the Lumes (enemies) through. The towers in this game are familiar with the first one with a couple of new editions. Also there are 4 characters you can play as and customize with various perks, weapons, and towers for endless possibilities strategically. Some maps are more difficult than others and will frustrate you as they did me. Sometimes I'm led to believe this game was meant to be played with others through co-op in order to beat the levels, but then I find a new plan that works and even though it may be hard, you can solo this game should you wish. Overall, I give this game a solid 8 out of 10 if I had to, and I recommend it to those of you who love real time strategy, FPS, and/or tower defense games. This game just has it all wrapped into one. Also, I strongly recommend it to those of you who are in need of a game outside of TF2 and looking for another great multiplayer game you can play together and have some fun. The single-player side is great--don't misunderstand--, but that feeling of success when shared with friends after beating a level makes it oh-so-much-more satisfying.","May 6, 2014","true","10.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993485991/recommended/210770/","76561197993485991","Henchmen no. 25","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197993485991/","118 products in account","So the premise of this game is that humans have established colonies in the skies over an alien planet. They use magical blue balls of light (cores) to convert the gasses present into oxygen and kill the native spores. The problem is that the planet is already occupied by an alien race of highly evolved mushrooms. The mushroom people under the direction of unknown telepathic boss entity whom you never fight create giant organic shafts to the colonies to try to murder them dead.\n\nIn the game you will create a maze of towers in an attempt to halt the advance of the mushroom people before they destroy you're magical blue ball as is typical of a Tower Defense game. you will spend 5, 10 or 15 minutes per level depositing towers that will ultimately only do about thirty percent of the damage necessary to kill the enemy waves. The rest is up to you. You can choose two of a plethora of weapons to aid you in the struggle. The game does not address why a gun held by a five foot two to six foot tall human out damages half dozen tool shed sized tower mounted guns you drop and arguably that means this game isn't really a TD. There are "perks" you can select to improve you're characters/towers performance but there’s really nothing that will turn this game into an actual Tower Defense, which is unfortunate.\n\nThe longer you play the game the more powerful guns, perks and towers you can unlock, particularly if you buy the DLC. I'm sure we all know the DLC drill by now. For an extra five dollars you will get access to all the content that was cut from the game during the alpha and beta tests for quality control and balance reasons. Ideally that content has since been fixed/balanced/polished but we never know until we shell out the cash. To their credit the DLC for Sanctum 2 does provide a lot of interesting content. The towers, perks and maps it adds do a great deal to increase replayability of the game and it rounds out the base games story that ends on a cliffhanger.\n\nThe real strength of this game is the level design. Like every other piece of science fiction made in the past twelve years almost everything looks like an Ipod that said this game does it particularly well. The integration of organic vines and spores growing over the utopian surfaces/structures in this game are very imaginative and well done. A lot of games (Doom 3/Dead Space) place a strong aesthetic emphasis in a human environment being reverse terraformed by some perverse alien influence but truthfully Sanctum 2 does it better. The levels are distinct from each other in groups as you proceed from an idealistic lived in colony under attack to the deteriorating front lines to an industrial themed colony abandoned some years or generations earlier. The theme is that the further into the game you go the closer to the planet you get until ultimately you are beneath its surface in a giant cavern with mushroom Jesus. In the tradition of classic FPS games there are many many secret areas and players are rewarded for their diligent exploration. Ironically the maps are far bigger in scope then the developers were prepared to work with and you’ll shudder when you realize that you can’t incorporate some of the games incredibly ideal choke points into you’re defense as they are simply too far away from where the action will be…. If they allowed you to place your own cores the quality of the game would quadruple immediately but thats something they will have to consider for a sequel.\n\nThe biggest issue with the game is the many many clipping errors. This game will kill you or force you to consul command suicide many times as you fall through solid objects or get stuck between them. In the basic game it doesn’t matter very much as you can wait out the 9 second respawn time once or twice and it isn’t likely to lose the game for you. Tragically the developers compounded this issue by encouraging the players to play with “five feats of strength” on to create a more challenging experience… One of these “feats” is a no respawn mode…  So basically each time you die to a developer error, which will be once or twice a game, you’ll also lose the level. Since playing with the feats of strength on is going to be your last real experience with the game they are brutally poisoning their consumer base who will only remember losing 30 minutes of an expertly played game because Coffe Stain Studio's didn’t properly patch or beta test. Hardcore modes are made for polished games made by hardcore developers. It might be a tough pill for Coffee Stain Studios to swallow but they just haven’t reached that point yet.\n\nFor ten dollars it is a really cool indie game. The maps if not always utilized ideally are a clever visual spectacle and it does have a lot of replay value. If Coffee Stain Studio focuses on adding general content to their games and take their player testers a little more seriously these guys could easily be around for another few years. Otherwise they'll find themselves doing the 3d effects for their regional weather channels talking about once whens.","May 18, 2014","true","207.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Many of the problems people had with the game when it came out are gone, and as a full package with all 4 DLC the game is fully realized and certainly worth your time and money.\n\nThis game is in a weird spot. If you're a shooter fan, it may feel like a fairly competent shooter, with some other weird turret things thrown in. If you're a Tower Defense player, it will feel very strange not always having a bird's eye veiw mainscreen (though there is a minimap and pressing a button will enlarge it so don't worry) and having these wierd variables of teammates and not having perfect aim all the time. If you like both, it is an outstanding blend of the two genres. And I recommend it to both fps and td fans. Fans of both sides may be dissapointed in the lack of this or that, but if you forget about games you've already played to compare it to for a minute, those things may not make sense in this hybrid.\n\nThat being said, the gameplay is phenomenal. A great blend of strategy and skill, but without requiring too many desicions and responsibilities that the player can easily become to overwhelmed. You build a maze, build towers (you choose what to bring beforehand) and then get to shooting. Mistakes are punished but don't mean the end until very late in the game. You have many ways to fix your holes and mistakes, even mid-wave. There is also an immense amount of freedom. Pro FPS-er? Take a bunch of perks that help you kill enemies and just let the towers clean up. TD Vet? Create a build that buffs your towers so you don't need to do much shooting. There's loads of combinations and styles of play that make the replay value even bigger. There's always that weird combo you want to try out for fun just to see if you can beat the level with it. The levels curve in very nicely, and there are enough modes and difficulty modifyers to keep you playing well after you've reached max level. Speaking of which, there's also a level up system where you unlock new weapons and perks. Early unlocks tend to be more general and easy to use, while still being powerful in their own right. Later unlocks are more specialized and require a bit more skill and familiarity with the game, and offer a slight better advantage if used correctly. No one unlock completely invalidates another, either. It's a very good system.\n\nIn addition, the single player and multiplayer are vastly different experiences. Play both. They're the exact same game but as soon as you have a team, its an almost completely different one. The way multiplayer and singleplayer seamlessly blend together is great as well, and usually only requires you to shift mindsets, not builds (at least in the middle of a map - organizing for the next one and specializing is one of the myriad ways the game becomes different).\n\nThe outstanding team at Coffeestain is one of the most hardworking and talented development teams I've seen from an indie studio in a long time. I often find myself drawing parallels between them and CDProjekt Red when they started out. You can see the level of attention to detail if you look at the game closely, how every little piece seems to sort of mesh together to make a very nice whole. The art and music direction is phenomenal, without saying anything and before the first wave even starts you get a feel for it, where you are, what you're doing, and the impact you're having. The comic book for loading screens just gives the right amount of context to understand what's going on, the environments, music, and enemies tell the real story.\n\nThe game isn't without its flaws though. Sometimes it can lag a little bit or disconnect you, but that could just be my bad internet. Many guns don't feel terribly satisfying to shoot because things don't have so much health, and many of the enemies look similar. It's hard to find to many criticisms for the game though.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend you pick up the whole package. It isn't for everyone, I will concede, so I also recommend trying the demo and see how you like the first few levels. Then pick up the whole game and if you want to the season pass or individual DLCs. They're all fantastic additions to the game. One even includes a fifth playable character. Don't worry if your friends aren't getting it and you think you'll have no one to play with, the community here is also one of the friendliest I've ever encountered.","December 17, 2013","true","84.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","2"

I agree with many other reviewers on the fact that this game is heavy on co-op playing instead of single player. Nevertheless, even solo, this game is a beauty and will keep you occupied for much longer than the original one.

It is very original and offers a unique fps experience that is constantly surprising me. Sanctum 2 sets itself apart from other fps games by implementing a strategy based tower defence aspect. The story and art style are oddly intriguing to me. The leveling up system has had me been striving to do my best to earn awesome perks and weapons that greatly add to the experience. The multiplayer mode is well thought out, balanced, fair, and is mostly oriented on team work. Sanctum 2 is well worth the cost. I know that I will be playing SAnctum 2 for years to come.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/centront2/recommended/210770/","centront2","Centron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/centront2/","410 products in account","TL;DR: Massive improvement over Sanctum 1. Leveling system doesn't feel grindy, and helps to introduce old and new sanctum players into the new towers and features. Multiplayer can be annoying sometimes with trolls public play, but overall the community is helpful and welcoming. Playing with friends is very rewarding and fun.\n\nLet's start from the top. If it is not obvious already, Sanctum 2 is the sequel to Sanctum, the Unreal Engine-based game that came on the scene slow at first before it made a big breakout on Steam, prompting this sequel.\n\nFirst impressions from a Sanctum 1 player: WOW, this game has fixed a lot of gameplay annoyances that the first Sanctum had. Sanctum 2 has trashed the high, inaccessible walls of its predecessor with more sensible barriers that the player can actually mantle. Also, towers can now be partially upgraded in between the proper "levels" so no more sitting on 99 credits that can't do anything because you are one short of the upgrade. All of your towers maxed out? You can now OVERCHARGE them with excess money, with diminishing returns of course.\n\nNext up, the UI. Another massive improvement. Sanctum 1 didn't really give great descriptions of each tower, and the stats of towers were not as easy to read, so knowing the proper abilities of a tower (essential for a Tower Defense game) couldn't be done at a glance. Now, a simple mouse over on the tower tells the player everything they need to know, and range is displayed in a helpful holographic overlay.\n\nNow, the new progression system, at first it may trigger the eyeroll of shoving grindy RPG elements where they don't belong, but the implementation is solid. The player isn't hamstrung from completing levels due to being a lower level. Grinding simply doesn't happen, in the since that you don't find yourself needing to repeat levels endlessly. You can however, enable "Feats of Strength" when you replay old levels to substantially increase difficulty (and your XP reward) if you find yourself wanting to level faster. Being low level also doesn't exclude you from playing with higher level players. Because each player is limited to a certain number of tower and perk slots, you can always find a niche to fill in multiplayer (I enjoy playing the rocket launcher character and managing airborne minions).\n\nOverall, I can't see a reason not to get this game if you enjoy Tower Defense or Action Shooters for that matter. Sanctum offers short, replayable fun for a very low price. Buy this game!","November 30, 2013","true","39.3"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

Sanctum is pretty easy to just jump into and enjoy, while Sanctum 2 requires you to learn how to really play the game and get some specific upgrades before it starts being really good. However, once you get to that point, it is a great experience possibly even better than the first despite the shortcomings.\n\nI give this a thumbs up overall because it is still a fun game; the blending of FPS and tower defense that is Sanctum is here, the maze-making strategy is here, and the multiplayer is better and more worthwhile than before. There are some good new features, but as a fan who loved and played a lot of the first, I am disappointed with a lot of the things they did here. But I'll start with the good:\n\nMultiple characters to choose from adds a new element of strategy, and equipping appropriate perks adds further. As all bonuses that can theoretically stack together do, equipping each character with appropriate perks for the best results is a welcome addition to the franchise that allows players to experiment for the combos that best suit them.\n\nMaps are much better designed than in the first Sanctum with much more attention to detail and more thought in strategic use of the environment. The campaign and leveling system are also a welcome addition, giving a feeling of progress, though some unlocks may take a bit too long to unlock. Lastly, there's a wider range of guns and towers available to choose from.\n\nIt also looks really nice graphically.\n\nBut now, the disappointments. I know this is a new game and shouldn't just be compared to the first, but as this is a sequel, things should get better, not worse, and a comparison will be necessary to make my point.\n\nMost of my issues can be summed up as such: the maps may be bigger, but the game feels so much smaller. Customization was supposed to be an important upgrade from Sanctum to Sanctum 2, but I honestly feel like the first had better customization. Number of guns allowed to each player has been reduced from 3 to 2, with 1 of those being locked to the character until capping your level, meaning only one weapon can actually be chosen for any given character, AND they can no longer be upgraded. Yet despite this, the game is actually more FPS-centric due to the limits on blocks and towers, as even without any feats of strength activated one can't really get away with just towers, again unlike the first, making for fewer different ways to actually play the game.\n\nNumber of towers brought to a map maxes out at 4 per player, down from the 6 of the original. Additionally, floors are gone completely and Holo tower and Televators have also left the building, leaving basically only the two slowing towers to support the FPS aspect at all, and no guns which do the reverse (Freeze is gone), severing that integration completely aside from a few perks. Also, towers can only be upgraded to level 3 instead of 6, after which they go into "overcharge," which is just throwing as many extra resources as you want at it to make it more continually more powerful, and I guess is basically the same thing.\n\nBlocks - now tower bases - are limited and given out per wave instead of costing a small amount of resources, preventing players from really building a maze until the map is over, seeing as maps are not longer than 10 waves, which was the shortest in the previous game, where it went as high as 30 in standard mode. Additionally, only 15 towers can actually be built per map, and the base cost of them has increased as much as 10x, no exaggeration; base Gatling now costs 100 instead of 10, and resources given hasn't increased to compensate (if anything it's lower). I guess as compensation upgrade costs don't increase as you continue to upgrade, but it doesn't matter much since they only go to level 3 and then overcharge anyway.\n\nWhat's the point of the maps being so big if I can only realistically use small portions of them?\n\nGood multiplayer is definitely not a bad thing in my book, but the game kind of shafts solo players. Many maps have multiple entry points for the enemies, occasionally in ways that prevent the two sides from ever joining before the core (and some have two cores), requiring a solo player to juggle two sides, a problem compounded further by the limitations to blocks and towers. A few of these maps existing would be fine, but not as many as there are here, especially since televators are no longer around to allow the player to move around quickly.\n\nThe game is definitely a better multiplayer experience than single. It can be played single player, but it will be frustrating at times. Best to get a friend or two in on the action. Again, still a good game overall. If you liked Sanctum but thought it needed some improving, this might be for you. If you liked a lot of things in Sanctum, give it a shot, but be careful.","November 30, 2013","true","104.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you are going into this expecting it to be exactly like the first, then be forewarned that it is not. Also, in this review, I am including all DLC in my considerations, and I am including into consideration what this game has set out to be rather than what I personally expect from a TD or FPS game.\n\nThat having been said to appease the die hard purists of the original and the two genres, this game is on it's own merrit absolutely awesome. It has it's highs and lows like most any game, although there are a lot more highs than there are lows. There is a little bit of pacing and balance issues when it comes to playing straight through as you will inevitably hit a point where you are forced to improve not only your skill but also your choice of armaments or when certain armaments or combinations that are just completely overkill for the level you are facing. With sufficient skill and sufficient experience with the different combos, there is no reason you can't make almost any combination work, but getting to that skill point will take a bit of time and some trial and error that you just wont nail down on your first play through or until you've played enough to cap out you levels. On the higher difficulty levels though, that skill and knowing the combinations is critical and on the hardest difficulty for the most part you will need to bring your A game and the best combos you can muster. That is all part of what makes a good TD game though; possibilities and choices in how you play, replayability without getting stale fast, and the flexibility of different difficulties that includes something for the casual to the hardcore.\n\nThe FPS element does feel light, and the TD element does feel somewhat simplified when compared to their pure counterparts, but the state of both is perfect for the sake of trying to play both at once without getting overwhelmed as a new player and in order to prevent requiring days of number crunching or rote memorization of patterns. At some point though, you will beat everything and then it will boil down to just survival mode and how many waves can you kill before it's impossible. When you get to that point after playing for many many hours, it will inevitably get pretty dull for most.\n\nAll in all, just considering Sanctum 2 and only the scope of the game, I would give it a 80/85 in terms of what it set out to do and how well it delivers (points docked due to lack of really long term replayability for completionists, and minor pacing/balance issues). I would give it a 80/100 when comparing it against all other games I've ever played of all genres.","August 16, 2014","true","125.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Players of the original Sanctum will find that it has a similar feel to the original, but the small things take a lot of getting used to, for example the UI is packed with more information than before on a different location of the screen. Initially because of this, I found the game difficult to play, but after playing a few levels the interface was fairly easy to read from and playing was comfortable. The levels themselves are colossal, full of secrets, and both graphically and aesthetically pleasing. The game is well optimised, as shown by my less-than-stellar PC being able to handle this game fairly well with some graphical options turned off. The gameplay feels like a less-flamboyant Borderlands, which suits the aesthetic of the game well. The game does have it's bugs. I, on more than one occasion have found myself wedged between two slanted sections of wall and getting stuck. The game does have a suicide button for this purpose, but during a wave it can be irritating dealing with the 10-second respawn time as the enemy skips merrily towards the core. I have encountered crash bugs, although I suspect they're my PC's fault.\nI heartily reccomend Sanctum 2, and by extension, it's predecessor Sanctum.

What makes this game really special is how it challenges you to think and to improve your strategy as you're presented with newer levels and higher difficulties.\n\nSanctum 2 has 32 unique maps, and to win these at the hardest setting, you will need to select particular sets of weapons, towers, and perks. You need different combinations because some maps will be more suitable for relying on your towers, while others maximize your own attacks.\n\nYou can play through all the maps solo, or you can join in 4-player co-op. Co-op is tricky, because unless you know another player well, you might end up with some weird people joining your game from basic matchmaking. Since resources are shared, you wouldn't want to waste your limited resources.\n\nGraphics: looks good. Use in conjunction with SweetFX to brighten some colours and remove noise.\nMusic: pretty fitting, with relaxing music during building phases, and faster tempos for fighting.\n\nOverall: Very fun.\n\nRating: 10/10.","May 25, 2014","true","94.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The gameplay feels like a less-flamboyant Borderlands, which suits the aesthetic of the game well. The game does have it's bugs. I, on more than one occasion have found myself wedged between two slanted sections of wall and getting stuck. The game does have a suicide button for this purpose, but during a wave it can be irritating dealing with the 10-second respawn time as the enemy skips merrily towards the core. I have encountered crash bugs, although I suspect they're my PC's fault.\nI heartily reccomend Sanctum 2, and by extension, it's predecessor Sanctum. Sanctum 2 is certainly one of my top-5 games of all time and you should certainly buy it if you think it'd be your thing.","March 23, 2014","true","89.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

What makes this game really special is how it challenges you to think and to improve your strategy as you're presented with newer levels and higher difficulties.\n\nSanctum 2 has 32 unique maps, and to win these at the hardest setting, you will need to select particular sets of weapons, towers, and perks. You need different combinations because some maps will be more suitable for relying on your towers, while others maximize your own attacks.\n\nYou can play through all the maps solo, or you can join in 4-player co-op. Co-op is tricky, because unless you know another player well, you might end up with some weird people joining your game from basic matchmaking. Since resources are shared, you wouldn't want to waste your limited resources.\n\nGraphics: looks good. Use in conjunction with SweetFX to brighten some colours and remove noise.\nMusic: pretty fitting, with relaxing music during building phases, and faster tempos for fighting.\n\nOverall: Very fun.\n\nRating: 10/10.","May 25, 2014","true","94.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is a sequel to Sanctum which was a pretty unique First-Person-Shooter/Tower Defence hybrid. While the first game had more feel of a 3D Tower Defence with a small help from you in the shooting part, Sanctum 2 throws the balance to more towards players - shooting and co-operation are very important if you are meaning to survive the large waves of enemies, yet leaving the building phase as a crucial stage too. The pacing of this game is very nice wave of fresh air as the shooting is balanced with the strategic planning of tower building.\n\nSanctum 2 improves the graphics (visual style is excellent in this game and gives it an unique vibe), gunplay and other gameplay mechanics vastly from the first one. Though, the first game has it own strengths so it's worth a check too, especially if you're interested more for the tower defence parts. But most importantly: buy Sanctum 2, it's one of the most exciting titles of 2013.\n\nBe aware that the core of Sanctum 2 is the co-op experience so while it can be played alone, it's recommend with other people online.","December 11, 2013","true","15.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Overall, Sanctum 2 is better than the original. With the original Sanctum, the waves of invading monsters on the maps were too numerous (we're talking 15-30 waves per map!), which made each map increasingly monotonous and tiresome toward its end. What's worse, actual boredom started to creep into the game after beating the 2nd or 3rd map, because by then you had seen and done pretty much all there was in the game. Which made the subsequent maps, and especially the DLC, seem superfluous.\n\nSanctum 2 rectifies all that by 1.) greatly reducing the number of monster waves on each map (down to 6-12 waves); 2.) including boss monsters in the waves; 3.) making the monsters agressively seek you out and attack you, which can kill you (but you can respawn);  4.) grouping the maps into themed subdivisions; 5.) unlocking more and more towers as you progress through the game; 6.) offering four different characters to play, each with a special weapon and ability; 7.) unlocking more and more buffs and abilities as you progress through the game, which can be slotted in and out for each character, customizing them and the towers they work with.\n\nHowever, the first-person shooter aspects of Sanctum continue to be flawed, perhaps even more so in Sanctum 2 than in the original. In either game, jumping is spongy and imprecise, and you tend to get tunnel-vision and disoriented in the mazes you create. What's worse in Sanctum 2, the point-of-view is ridiculously low to the ground, as if none of the characters have legs!  Also, you tend to get snagged by and stuck on the many fixtures and decorations of a map as you're running around, fighting the monsters. Like, on one map that really annoyed me, I kept getting snagged by the guard rails as I moved near them (oh, and the waist-high rails would obstruct me if I stopped and tried to lean over them, to shoot at the monsters below), and at one intersection on that map, there was a staple-like object on the floor that I kept getting stuck on as I ran over it.\n\nEven so, I still recommend the Sanctum games, particularly the 2nd one. Especially if, like me, you enjoy and are challenged by tower-defense hybrid games.","January 31, 2014","true","22.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Which made the subsequent maps, and especially the DLC, seem superfluous.\n\nSanctum 2 rectifies all that by 1.) greatly reducing the number of monster waves on each map (down to 6-12 waves); 2.) including boss monsters in the waves; 3.) making the monsters agressively seek you out and attack you, which can kill you (but you can respawn);  4.) grouping the maps into themed subdivisions; 5.) unlocking more and more towers as you progress through the game; 6.) offering four different characters to play, each with a special weapon and ability; 7.) unlocking more and more buffs and abilities as you progress through the game, which can be slotted in and out for each character, customizing them and the towers they work with.\n\nHowever, the first-person shooter aspects of Sanctum continue to be flawed, perhaps even more so in Sanctum 2 than in the original. In either game, jumping is spongy and imprecise, and you tend to get tunnel-vision and disoriented in the mazes you create. What's worse in Sanctum 2, the point-of-view is ridiculously low to the ground, as if none of the characters have legs!  Also, you tend to get snagged by and stuck on the many fixtures and decorations of a map as you're running around, fighting the monsters. Like, on one map that really annoyed me, I kept getting snagged by the guard rails as I moved near them (oh, and the waist-high rails would obstruct me if I stopped and tried to lean over them, to shoot at the monsters below), and at one intersection on that map, there was a staple-like object on the floor that I kept getting stuck on as I ran over it.\n\nEven so, I still recommend the Sanctum games, particularly the 2nd one. Especially if, like me, you enjoy and are challenged by tower-defense hybrid games.","January 31, 2014","true","22.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Sanctum is pretty easy to just jump into and enjoy, while Sanctum 2 requires you to learn how to really play the game and get some specific upgrades before it starts being really good. However, once you get to that point, it is a great experience possibly even better than the first despite the shortcomings.\n\nI give this a thumbs up overall because it is still a fun game; the blending of FPS and tower defense that is Sanctum is here, the maze-making strategy is here, and the multiplayer is better and more worthwhile than before. There are some good new features, but as a fan who loved and played a lot of the first, I am disappointed with a lot of the things they did here. But I'll start with the good:\n\nMultiple characters to choose from adds a new element of strategy, and equipping appropriate perks adds further. As all bonuses that can theoretically stack together do, equipping each character with appropriate perks for the best results is a welcome addition to the franchise that allows players to experiment for the combos that best suit them.\n\nMaps are much better designed than in the first Sanctum with much more attention to detail and more thought in strategic use of the environment. The campaign and leveling system are also a welcome addition, giving a feeling of progress, though some unlocks may take a bit too long to unlock. Lastly, there's a wider range of guns and towers available to choose from.\n\nIt also looks really nice graphically.\n\nBut now, the disappointments. I know this is a new game and shouldn't just be compared to the first, but as this is a sequel, things should get better, not worse, and a comparison will be necessary to make my point.\n\nMost of my issues can be summed up as such: the maps may be bigger, but the game feels so much smaller. Customization was supposed to be an important upgrade from Sanctum to Sanctum 2, but I honestly feel like the first had better customization. Number of guns allowed to each player has been reduced from 3 to 2, with 1 of those being locked to the character until capping your level, meaning only one weapon can actually be chosen for any given character, AND they can no longer be upgraded. Yet despite this, the game is actually more FPS-centric due to the limits on blocks and towers, as even without any feats of strength activated one can't really get away with just towers, again unlike the first, making for fewer different ways to actually play the game.\n\nNumber of towers brought to a map maxes out at 4 per player, down from the 6 of the original. Additionally, floors are gone completely and Holo tower and Televators have also left the building, leaving basically only the two slowing towers to support the FPS aspect at all, and no guns which do the reverse (Freeze is gone), severing that integration completely aside from a few perks. Also, towers can only be upgraded to level 3 instead of 6, after which they go into "overcharge," which is just throwing as many extra resources as you want at it to make it more continually more powerful, and I guess is basically the same thing.\n\nBlocks - now tower bases - are limited and given out per wave instead of costing a small amount of resources, preventing players from really building a maze until the map is over, seeing as maps are not longer than 10 waves, which was the shortest in the previous game, where it went as high as 30 in standard mode. Additionally, only 15 towers can actually be built per map, and the base cost of them has increased as much as 10x, no exaggeration; base Gatling now costs 100 instead of 10, and resources given hasn't increased to compensate (if anything it's lower). I guess as compensation upgrade costs don't increase as you continue to upgrade, but it doesn't matter much since they only go to level 3 and then overcharge anyway.\n\nWhat's the point of the maps being so big if I can only realistically use small portions of them?\n\nGood multiplayer is definitely not a bad thing in my book, but the game kind of shafts solo players. Many maps have multiple entry points for the enemies, occasionally in ways that prevent the two sides from ever joining before the core (and some have two cores), requiring a solo player to juggle two sides, a problem compounded further by the limitations to blocks and towers. A few of these maps existing would be fine, but not as many as there are here, especially since televators are no longer around to allow the player to move around quickly.\n\nThe game is definitely a better multiplayer experience than single. It can be played single player, but it will be frustrating at times. Best to get a friend or two in on the action. Again, still a good game overall. If you liked Sanctum but thought it needed some improving, this might be for you. If you liked a lot of things in Sanctum, give it a shot, but be careful.","November 30, 2013","true","104.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

A great way to have a ton of fun with your friends, it gets repetetive some hundreds of hours into the game I suppose because I have not found it so a single time. If you add one friend it gets twice as fun. If you add another you might as well be playing Super Mario on your old N64. It's that much fun. If this ever goes on sale it's a definite must, otherwise I recommend this if you're looking for an active group oriented Tower Defense that is more than just a TD Game.","July 17, 2015","true","13.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Adding co-op to the list of having fun plus all the other tweaks make this a must-have for td/fps lovers. I agree with many other reviewers on the fact that this game is heavy on co-op playing instead of single player. Nevertheless, even solo, this game is a beauty and will keep you occupied for much longer than the original one.","November 26, 2013","true","17.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Whether you've played the original or are a newcomer to the series, Sanctum 2 is an amazing game to play. There's not much to say but 'wow' when you realise how unique this game is - I don't think that I've personally seen any first person shooter/tower defense crosses before, but it's something that there needs to be more of, because the combination of strategy and action in this style of game leaves you having a LOT of fun if you're into those kind of games.","February 7, 2014","true","6.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It all started years ago playing Gemcraft and other TDF. When I first played Sanctum I was blown away. I was really eager to play Sanctum 2 and it has not disappointed.

The new characters are great and the unlocks add challenge but not too much frustration.","December 5, 2013","true","22.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

This is a sequel to Sanctum which was a pretty unique First-Person-Shooter/Tower Defence hybrid. While the first game had more feel of a 3D Tower Defence with a small help from you in the shooting part, Sanctum 2 throws the balance to more towards players - shooting and co-operation are very important if you are meaning to survive the large waves of enemies, yet leaving the building phase as a crucial stage too. The pacing of this game is very nice wave of fresh air as the shooting is balanced with the strategic planning of tower building.\n\nSanctum 2 improves the graphics (visual style is excellent in this game and gives it an unique vibe), gunplay and other gameplay mechanics vastly from the first one. Though, the first game has it own strengths so it's worth a check too, especially if you're interested more for the tower defence parts. But most importantly: buy Sanctum 2, it's one of the most exciting titles of 2013.\n\nBe aware that the core of Sanctum 2 is the co-op experience so while it can be played alone, it's recommend with other people online.","December 11, 2013","true","15.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"
