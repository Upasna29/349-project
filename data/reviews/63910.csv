The mechanics take a little bit to figure out but after about an hour you should have a pretty firm grasp of what does what. The graphics are pretty darn good if a little cartoony but that doesn't bother me any. I really like the mix of strategy/fantasy rpg. It's actually a lot of fun, sorta like playing fantasy chess if you will. There doesn't seem to be much of any voice acting, again not a problem for me but just be prepared to do a lot of reading to get the back story and follow what is going on.\n\nWould definitely recommend a buy if you like these kind of games. I'm terrible at and have always hated strategy games but this one is pretty darn fun. Also my first time reviewing a game on steam so, that should tell you something.","May 17, 2015","true","4.1"," 26 of 27 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","26","27","0","0"

You get a dragon that can cast a spell per turn (increased turn cooldown depending which spell you choose) and your hero character (the armored princess) can cast a spell per turn. Your hero character equips armor and weapons that change your hero's stats. The hero isn't involved in combat other than spells but your stats are attributed to your units in combat. Overall King's bounty is one of my favorite games and it is oddly addicting.","December 20, 2013","true","51.0"," 25 of 29 people (86%) found this review helpful","86","25","29","0","0"

The Kings Bounty series remains one of my favorites of all time, and one of the only series I'll actually replay through several times. It's an exploration game where you lead armies around the world, picking up relics and leveling up your character. It plays similarly to games like Heroes of Might and Magic, but the major difference (and the reason I like this series better), is you are encouraged and rewarded for exploring. There is no turn counter while you explore the map, putting you in a race against other towns or enemies. Explore as much as you want and roam everywhere without fear that your enemy is building up their army while you have fun. If you run into an area where the enemy is too strong for you, just explore somewhere else and come back once you gain some levels and spells.","June 26, 2014","true","227.3"," 20 of 24 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","20","24","0","0"

It offers you the main campaign (Orcs on the March: Expansion for Armored Princess with additional content) and 2 other smaller campaigns (Champion of the Arena: Boss Battles in Gladiatorial Combat & Defender of the Crown: Battles in Unique Arenas). It is suppose to be similar to the HOMM & Fallen Enchantress, but it feels more enjoyable with the main campaign lasting between 40-60 hours. You get to choose between 3 starting classes (Warrior, Paladin, Mage), each with a special ability (skill) and with crossoworlds, you receive an additional skill, which varies depending on your class. You also get a pet dragon, which can "cast" special dragon abilities, which are really cool!! Overall the game is worth playing and I would recommend it!!\n\nPros:\nBeautiful Music\nSpells & Pet Dragon\nRandomized "Worlds" (No 2 playthroughs are the same)\nGood Story\nLots of different types of units to use, ranging from humans, to undead to dragons…\n\nCons:\nLearning curve is a bit high (but once you figure out the game, it is really easy)\nThe first 4 islands can be hard for a new player","March 23, 2014","true","158.5"," 13 of 18 people (72%) found this review helpful","72","13","18","0","0"

Orcs on the March is the expansion to Armoured Princess, so you might as well play that version of the two.\n\nThis series has a love it or hate it style of gameplay. The changes this game series has from version to version is very minor.\nIt's a hex-grid turn based RPG, and when your not in battle, you will be clicking the landscape to explore the land, pick up items, searching for gold, talking to people for quests.\n\nThe game can feel slow paced at times and the music is very classical so it's actually possible to doze off playing this game.\n\nIf you enjoy the series or want to get into it, this is a fine game to spend time on.","October 23, 2015","true","22.3"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

It's cute but a failure to innovate the series leaves new players a choice of 4 or 5 ames that are essentially the same. Crossworlds is probably the best of the King's Bounty series. The game is bright, colorful and interesting to explore. Having an interesting game world goes a long way in keeping your interest.\n\nThe gameplay is rather simple. Buy your troops (these increase over time) and go fight battles. Again and again and again. It's tough to figure out why I like this game so much because it is so repetitive. But every battle is different, every combination of troops a potential interesting tactical puzzle to solve and there's always something - a quest, an area or just a distant castle - to keep you moving foward. There's always a challenge out there and there's always a new, interesting place to visit and cool, different types of troops to use. There's always a new spell to use or upgrade, and new item to equp or a new skill to choose. The rewards are well paced and keep the player interested in the game.\n\nNow I believe sometimes a game can take too long and this is one. It would have been a better game at 20 hours. After wa while you may very well get bored with the formula. In fact, it could be said that the game may be best played on easy just so you can move through the content as quickly as possible. But it's one of those titles that you can dive back into and pick up at any time.\n\nThe formula works well enough despite the repitive nature of the game.

The game is pretty solidly balanced, and many different strategies will work. I got 85 hours out of King's Bounty: The Legend just going through the game once, and I have 93 hours in Armored Princess/Crossworlds. An important thing to note is that the Crossworlds expansion has an updated version of the Armored Princess campaign, so unless you want to play it twice you should probably do the Crossworlds version of it. I think both games in the series are worth playing.\n\nOnly play on Hard if you are prepared for an actual challenge, because King's Bounty does not ♥♥♥♥ around. The Warrior class seems a little less viable on Hard than the others, but I still beat the game on Hard with a Warrior.

But there's a serious flaw: it's too easy unless it's on the hardest mode, but then it becomes unwinnable unless you use -one- tactic as a specific point in the game. So, once you get to snowy island with the machines and nords, get engineers, robots, and split your healer-bots into two groups. Make them heal each other.\n\nNow you've gotten through the unbalanced part of the game.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/alwc37/recommended/63910/","alwc37","alwc37","http://steamcommunity.com/id/alwc37/","174 products in account","Fairly Early on review. Posting simply in case somebody with the game on their wishlist sees it, before the summer sale ends.\n\nOdd concepts that so far do not equal a truly great game. Non Re-spawning enemies is a odd choice, when adding in the permadeath of your troops, being able to grind the new ones up to a suitable level feels like a needed feature. King's Bounty instead teaches you to take better care of them, and will have you re-loading after a hard fought battle, simply because you did not win it with acceptable losses.\n\nThe story is interesting, but presented in text conversations that tend to go on and on....if you are like me, and reading is not something you tend to do in games, you may find yourself simply skipping everything and just following your quest marker. I am honestly not sure what is going on in my game, but the opening video and story seemed like a nice concept. Dimensional travel, in search of possible time travel....or maybe I didn't pay enough attention and have that wrong.\n\nLots of different troops, each playing slightly different in battle. Fights are turn based, and take place on a hex board. Some boards will have obstacles in your path, and you and your enemy will also have the ability to spawn more if need be. Your hero does not actually fight however, but simply gives orders and casts magic. While that was certainly disappointing, it does not detract to much from it. Fights are tense, but do tend to take awhile once the enemy starts piling up large amounts of troops.\n\nThe fights are made easier by the inclusion of a dragon you are given at the start of the game. You can summon it every other turn to do multiple things. Great damage, build walls, pick up treasure, give more magic, and more. Have a hard foe, or a enemy taking pot shots at you from long range? Just let the dragon kill them, no real strategy needed. While he does feel cheap, I did enjoy using him.\n\nThis reminds me of a board game. You move your pieces around, and try to out think or out maneuver your opponent. I am only on the 3rd Island, but so far the AI does not seem to be the greatest. They tend to consider how each troop acts, but not how to use them with the other units in their army. Terrain also seems to confuse them, though it may only be due to how early in the game I am. Most of the challenge thus far has come from the large numbers or troops, instead of their tactics. They tend to just rush me with melee, and have the mages or archers stay back.\n\nGame looks very dated, almost reminds me of World of Warcraft when it first launched. It still looks decent though, and it is very vibrant and colorful. No real issues on that end, and I like the cartoonish look of everything.\n\nThe game so far has been enjoyable, and there are cheat codes you could resort to if the permadeath becomes a issue. So I would say don't let that and not being able to grind keep you from trying it out. The price is decent, and I have easily gotten my moneys worth with as little as I have played so far. I would say the biggest enjoyment is trying out all the different troops and seeing what each one can do. Then trying to build a hero around supporting them.","June 30, 2014","true","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Having played both Armored Princess and this, I'd give my recommendation to this game. It has certain quests that I thouroghly enjoyed and many new and powerful units. This game did crash more than Armored Princess. That's a total of 1. I set sail for a new island and crashed hard.\n\nI will say that the other games attached to this are kind of crap. The arena is basically all the boss fights. The lizardmen campain is nearly worthless. They are thankfully short and, I suppose, good for a quick dose of the gameplay without getting sucked in to the main storyline.\n\nThe graphics are old, but haven't started showing their age just yet. The sound is slightly repetitive. Some of the quests are best skipped.\n\nOverall, you won't be disappointed.","June 8, 2015","true","24.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Similar to Heroes of Might and Magic. Definetly worth the price.\n\nI would recommend playing this instead of 'Kings Bounty the legend' since this one has simingly minor improvements that really help you out throughout the long campaign.\n\nThe boss battles are a bit tough though, even on easy difficulty, since it doesn't allow you to use your pet dragon, which I find kind of an odd design choice since boss battles are really where you need extra help...","March 17, 2015","true","35.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Haven't played all the campaigns yet, focusing on beating the original one first.  This game does require some strategy and it's good to save often.  Each island is a bit of a challenge, but eventually enemies stop being marked as "lethal" or "invincible" and then it's just a matter of (saving first) jumping in to the fight.\n\nGetting around is easy, graphics are good enough (imho), don't care about the story at all though I do find the Princess's dialogue to be trite and badly written.

Yes, there's actually a raw copy of 'Armored Princess', plus another one that includes an expansion pack about orcs, which brings some new quests, items etc. Besides that, there're also two other mini campaign modes available. In one of them, you're this random guy who find himself in an arena and have to fulfill certain missions in order to be able to gain influence and recruit stronger creatures to fight against the bosses. The other one I'd say that is like a 'training drill' for Amelie, where you have to go through a few difficult battles in order to prove your value or something. Anyway, both of these can be finished quite easily. Overall, if you haven't bought 'Armored Princess' yet, I'd strongly advise you to just skip it, because this title is unarguably superior.","September 25, 2015","true","59.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I have put over 26 hours into the game so far, and while I have gotten somewhat tired of the game, I have thoroughly enjoyed it.  What I can't emphasize enough is the value that comes with this game.  26+ hours in, and I still haven't beat the first of the four campaigns; I am probably 75% through the campaign I am in right now.  There is easily 100+ hours of content in this game, way more than you get out of most AAA titles, and at around 10-15% of the price (on sale).   The graphics remind me of an updated version of Warcraft 3 (which I love), and I really enjoyed the combat.  If you are a fan of these types of games, there is no reason why you shouldn't pick up Kings Bounty: Crossworlds.","September 14, 2015","true","28.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Also the main campaign continues from the 1st game so if you haven't played that yet then you might want to.\n\nA few changes worth mentioning:\n1. You now have achievements that when completed give stat bonuses. This might annoy some people since a lot of them demand you play a certain way to unlock them. Ex: using fireball X number of times, not losing any troops in X number of battles and so on.\n2. In this one one get a baby dragon as your rage ''tool'' and since he doesn't get any dialog players expecting a interesting side character like the rage spirits might get a bit let down.\n3. Better map navigation then the 1st. Having a ship going to separate islands makes the trips back home for reinforcements soooooo much faster.\n4. Difficulty is higher than Legend so this might be a + or - depending on the player. Personally while it took a little while to get used to it I found the added difficulty welcome ( most of the time ).","January 31","true","124.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
