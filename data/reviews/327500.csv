"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/recommended/327500/","tgr1","Kelly Osbourne","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tgr1/","436 products in account","There's something inspirational about Zenzizenzic. Not only was it conceived while its developer Ruud Koorevaar was unemployed, it's actually his first foray into game development. Whilst tinkering with Unity tutorials he decided to create a simple game, but one with tight mechanics and rewarding gameplay. The result is a frantic twin-stick bullethell shooter that's as addictive as it is pretty.\n\nOn the surface, there isn't much separating Zenzizenzic from its many peers; it has difficult to master gameplay, a buttload of enemies, and a screen full  of bullets, but it has some nice touches of its own, too.\n\nZenziznezic evokes an unbridled sense of freedom, allowing players to approach enemies from any angle, and any part of the screen. While moving the ship around it can speed up or slow down with the left or right triggers, allowing players to fine tune their movement at any given second. In an interesting twist speed also dictates certain characteristics of your ship's weapons. For example, speeding up makes some projectiles fire across the screen much quicker, whereas slower movement has the opposite effect, but also makes some bullets cause more damage as they swell in size.\n\nThe choice of weapons on offer elevates Zenzizenzic's gameplay and further separates it from its peers. Whilst it's possible to play the game like any other bullethell shooter, getting to know each of the unlockable weapons and formulating a strategy on how best to use them provides satisfaction and rewards you'll rarely find elsewhere.  Each unlock comes at a set price, which ties into how many points you have scored throughout the game. The great thing about Zenzizezic is that no matter how difficult things get,  and they will get difficult, I always felt like I had made progress towards unlocking something new. I never quite reached that ragequit moment because the game rewarded my valiant efforts.\n\nYou'll need to know the game's mechanics inside out if you are to stand any chance of completing its five main stages, each of which is packed with weird and wonderful creations out to inflict maximum pain. Enemies swarm in from all sides, often with scores of other, smaller enemies trailing them. The action never lets up, and you'll be forced to constantly survey the screen for the safest looking areas for your ship. You'll also need to juggle your health bars and weapon energy bars whilst dodging countless enemies, bullets and laser beams - it's the type of game where your sphincter might spontaneously tighten up at a moment's notice.\n\nAll of this action is set against a backdrop of geometric shapes, simple sprites and an almost fractal looking overlap of multi-coloured bullets, enemies and backgrounds. There's real beauty in the game's simplicity and how its individually simple design elements combine to create something gorgeous to look at. Pair it with Bignic's eclectic, bass-heavy soundtrack and you've got a game that apes its contemporaries but still manages to break off in a direction of its own.\n\nZenzational!\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTaken from: http://criticalindiegamer.com/2015/07/zenzizenzic-is-a-heavenly-bullethell-shooter/","July 19, 2015","true","12.3"," 23 of 24 people (96%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","96","23","24","0","0"

This game has perfect pacing, and as someone who rarely plays bullet hell games, I'm now interested in the genre as a whole. While it has a few hitches (I ran into a weird menu bug myself...), none of the glitches or lag issues occur during gameplay. Gameplay is blissful and it feels the same as playing Audiosurf or Crypt of the Necromancer. Sure, you die a bit. Okay, you die a lot. But it's incredibly fun.\n\nThe developer has already posted a patch, and new content is already on its way. Although it has a small amount of levels, the pacing curve makes the game feel complete. There are plenty of games on Steam that offer just an hour of playtime for this price point. This is not one of them. It took me three hours to beat level two. I've unlocked all the levels with my points, though, and I can at least tell that it just gets crazier from there. I'd like to see someone who's beaten the game post how long it took.\n\nAnyways, I'm rambling. This is a game I would recommend to players who have a positive outlook on life and love seeing their score go higher and higher. Shooter fans and bullet hell fans...this is a required purchase for you.","April 7, 2015","true","3.3"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","81","21","26","4","2"

This game takes my new preferred twin stick blaster even above other highly regarded games like Super Stardust and Geometry Wars!  This little game is better!\n\nIts a ton of fun and very, very addictive.   It offers local high scores and online high scores to compete against.\n\nIt is very fluid, responsive, and requires your full attention to avoid death and losing one of your lives.\n\nThe level progession offers bonus rounds and different waves and always seems to throw something new at you to keep you on your feet.  This makes the game very fun, very exciting, and the music flows well with the game as well.\n\nBut here is where I think this game takes the biggest step and puts itself above other great highly regarded twin stick shooters.  This game offers an open world almost rogue-style mode where you get to move and explore a big open world while blaasting away all the baddies and collecting power ups, battling bosses etc.  In this mode, you can even go to "stores" and use your score as money to purchase all kinds of different power ups etc.  Awesome, awesome fun, and makes this game stand above the rest.  I've never seen another twin-stick arcade shooter like this do anything like that!\n\nBrilliant game design, and for all the reasons above.. Zenzizenzic is my favorite Steam game of 2015 so far!\n\nMy score.. 93% (out of 100)  Pretty impressive score and game especially considering its still in 'early access'.  Oh... how we wish all early access games on Steam were this good don't we?\n\nEasily worth your money, ..It's a shame I'm giving this game it's first review 4 days after its Steam launch.  ..If you are a fan of Geometry Wars or Super Stardust or even a rogue-like RPG fan, you're missing out on a quiet little Indie gem if you pass this game by!","April 5, 2015","true","2.6"," 21 of 26 people (81%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","81","21","26","2","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/recommended/327500/","MartyrA2J","MartyrA2J","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MartyrA2J/","557 products in account","Zenzizenzic aside from having the honor of having the most Z's in a games title and sounding drunk when you say the games name, is an arcade style shmup or shoot 'em up, bullet hell game. This game is light on story, high on action, being the type of game that you would probably sink quarter after quarter into if this were sometime in the mid 90's. What that basically means is that you're in pursuit of a high score more then any clear cut goal. You play over and over again, dying, getting better, unlocking upgrades and ramping up the difficulty. Oh yeah, if you're a fan of squares and plaid then this is the game for you!\n\nSarcasm aside, Zenzizenzic is a very geometrical strange looking game and this is the first thing that is striking about the game. Yes, it uses basic shapes for most of its design but it's the use of colors and design of enemies that can be very appealing looking, even though they're just shapes. There are times where so many things are on the screen that it becomes almost overwhelming to the senses, although this is kinda the point of bullet hell games. Enemies come in a vast range of colors and shapes while your tiny ship is mostly just a blue block that shoots things.\n\nSpeaking of shooting things, you're going to do that a lot in this game. Not just shooting though, there are missiles, lasers, power ups, black holes, time travel, leveling, and more that I probably forgot to mention. The game is quite feature rich for a simplistic game, containing two game modes that are distinct from each other. Classic mode is your standard quarter guzzler, you pick a level, a difficulty, and get the highest score you can without dying. Waves upon waves of enemies spawn in all ultimately leading to a boss. One thing that Classic mode has over the other, is that you can play Co-op with a friend, while in Macro mode you can't. Your points can be spent to unlock new weapons, levels, and other goodies.\n\nMacro mode is a whole different ball game, having more roguelike elements and randomization of enemies, areas, items, bosses and anything else you would expect. You start off in a safe zone area and then are free to move about. I enjoyed this mode by far the most, mostly cause I am not a huge fan of repetitive high score games. This was refreshing, weird, but fun. The same basic elements apply though, you look for enemies, upgrades, as a small meter on the bottom of the screen fills up and eventually releases a boss at you. Once said boss is defeated you move on and get as far as you can. There are stat upgrades and many other things that you can tweak, change, and modify to your play style. All this works rather well.\n\nZenzizenzic doesn't let down in the options department either. Ranging from rebindable keys, multiple resolutions, screenshake, dead zones, controller support, achievements, and of course leaderboards for all you score lovers out there. There are multiple difficulties and the game does offer quite a high replay value if you enjoy bullet hell style games. Offering things like bonus levels, practice modes and tutorials that teach you the basics.\n\nMusically, Zenzizenzic is pretty diverse, having nine tracks that you are free to flip through and enjoy.\nThese all have a nice electronica style to them and for the most part never really got annoying. Sound effects were nothing too spectacular but did get the job done for. There were times I just wanted an explosion or feel a little bit more oomph to my blasts. This is a very minor complaint mind you.\n\nAs to the games length, that all really depends on the player. You could play this for endless hours trying to achieve the highest scores on the leader board, or like me spend most of your time in macro mode, die, and take a break and come back later. While the roguelike elements do keep things fresh, the gameplay itself doesn't really change all that much aside from weapon choices. Again, this is all personal preference and how much you enjoy these types of games. It's fun but it gets slightly repetitive eventually. There is only so much connection one can have with a square.\n\nOne thing I will say about Zenzizenzic is that it's unique. Not necessarily in the game features department but in over all design. This game looks quite striking when you first load it up and suddenly are blasted in the face with colors and shapes. Yes, other games have done similar designs but Zenzizenzic has a unique delivery that I just found peculiar and different.\n\nZenzizenzic has everything you could want in its genre, from leaderboards, co-op, and buckets of replay value. At $9.99 it's also very affordable and very much worth your money. The game is completely bug free and controls tightly for dodging of all those pesky rectangles. So get ready for some chaos, untwist your tongue and play Zenzizenzic.","August 30, 2015","true","2.4"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","92","11","12","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CricketLenny/recommended/327500/","CricketLenny","cricketlenny","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CricketLenny/","483 products in account","Early Access Review\n\n(Review written during Early Access Beta, opinions and info may change after time of writing)\nZenzizenzic is a great addition to the shmup genre, showing great tight controls and excellent bullet hell-esque fights to conquer, and always presenting a bigger challenge after most every victory. Personally, the biggest draw for me is Macro, the rogue-like mode of this game. Having the great gameplay of a twinstick shooter mixed with the near endless replayability and tense action of a rogue-like make this interesting and fun enough to recommend to most anyone who enjoys either genre. The soundtrack also deserves mention, with great techno/electronic tunes accompanying the madness. Worth the price just to try out the uniqueness of Macro alone.\n\nHowever, I must also note some negatives for the sake of integrity.\nEven though the music is good, it appears to be relatively limited, and may become repetitive if played for long periods of time.\nI encountered several minor and one major bug while playing. The minor ones were temporary dips in framerate and occasional stuttering, and the major bug being several enemies spawning on top of my location in Macro, resulting in a near immediate death.\nThe level of optimization is relatively low, as even though this is a 2d game with mostly simple geometric shapes, I am unable to run it at anything but the "Fastest" option in regards to a stable and smooth framerate, as putting it at the highest setting made it anywhere from 15-20 FPS. Mind, my computer isn't a powerhouse, but a game with visuals of this style shouldnt be an issue.\n\nAll of these issues have been brought to the attention of the dev, and have been acknowledged as problems being adressed in future patches.\n\nOn the issues regarding performance and framerate, here are my technical specifications for the sake on knowing what you could expect out of your own computer (I typically got 60+ on the Fastest graphical setting, and ~20 on the highest graphical setting, all running at 1366x768)\n\nProcessor Information:\nVendor:  GenuineIntel\nCPU Family:  0x6\nCPU Model:  0x3a\nCPU Stepping:  0x9\nCPU Type:  0x0\nSpeed:  2494 Mhz\n4 logical processors\n2 physical processors\nHyperThreading:  Supported\nFCMOV:  Supported\nSSE2:  Supported\nSSE3:  Supported\nSSSE3:  Supported\nSSE4a:  Unsupported\nSSE41:  Supported\nSSE42:  Supported\n\nOperating System Version:\nWindows 7 (64 bit)\nNTFS:  Supported\nCrypto Provider Codes:  Supported 311 0x0 0x0 0x0\n\nVideo Card:\nDriver:  Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000\n\nDirectX Driver Name:  igdumdim32.dll\nDriver Version:  10.18.10.3958\nDirectX Driver Version:  10.18.10.3958\nDriver Date: 30 Sept 2014\nOpenGL Version: 4.0\nDesktop Color Depth: 32 bits per pixel\nMonitor Refresh Rate: 60 Hz\nDirectX Card: Intel(R) HD Graphics 4000\nVendorID:  0x8086\nDeviceID:  0x166\nNumber of Monitors:  1\nNumber of Logical Video Cards:  1\nNo SLI or Crossfire Detected\nPrimary Display Resolution:  1366 x 768\nDesktop Resolution: 1366 x 768\nPrimary Display Size: 18.98" x 10.67"  (21.73" diag)\n48.2cm x 27.1cm  (55.2cm diag)\nPrimary Bus Type Not Detected\nPrimary VRAM: -1984 MB\nSupported MSAA Modes:  2x 4x 8x\n\nSound card:\nAudio device: Speakers (High Definition Audio\n\nMemory:\nRAM:  8067 Mb","April 10, 2015","true","8.9"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","11","13","0","2"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ActualChrisHex/recommended/327500/","ActualChrisHex","High Impact Hexual Violence","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ActualChrisHex/","10 products in account","This is such a good shooter. Really worth the buy.\n- The art style is so simple, and yet, it's so satisfying to the eyes. I personally saw most shooters as carbon copies of others, mainly because they're all revolved around space, high tech warfare gadgets, and monsters, but this is a chainbreaker. I mean, it's just squares, but dude, it's these squares man, these squares are amazing.\n- The music has really good beats, really good electronic-styled music. I don't know the exact genre to call it, but I'm sure you might know what I'm talking about. The tracks go along great with the stages, so it won't distract you, in fact, it helps focus.\n- The gameplay, oh the gameplay. You have the basic "hold _ to shoot", but you also have the ability to select two out of six special abilities, such as lazers, a swarm of heat seeking missiles, and even a black hole generator. When you defeat an enemy, it'll drop pellets to fill energy, and when you stop shooting, you'll send out a shockwave that vacuums 'em up to use right away. Oh, and you better memorize what key buys a life back, you'll most likely press that at least a few times.\n...Now, there are some cons that'll hopefully be patched up. First off, there is a bug in regular mode's level 3. If you were to buy a life back right as you're exiting the bonus stage, you might end up unable to see what's going on, as your screen would just show up blank.\nAnother thing that struck me as odd was something about the macro mode. Not sure if this was intended or not, but there isn't a way to save progress. Judging by the time limit before boss fights, this might be intended to be unable to save. Oh well, Macro is still great.\nDude, why are you still reading this?

While there’s very little crossover between the two modes, they’re still both recognizably born from the same idea, but with necessary tweaks for that idea to work within the parameters of each mode. Classic and Macro mode both throw hordes of enemies and swarms of bullets your way, tossing you into the deep end to figure out which of the many tools at your disposal is the best for every situation, while also providing plenty of opportunity for learning. Zenzizenzic is a far more complicated game than you’ll normally see in the twin-stick genre, but the power-ups, special weapons, and speed options that make it tricky to learn also add incredible depth to the shooting. There’s an enormous world of technique and a million square enemies to practice it on in the colorful geometries of Zenzizenzic, and much like driving a car, once you know what all the bits do you can make that machine sing.","April 15, 2015","true","15.9"," 5 of 7 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","5","7","0","0"

If you like twin stick shooters, or roguelikes, then for the price this game's absolutely worth it.  The soundtrack alone is worth the price of admission, and you'll be dazzled by the visual effects that accompany it.","July 22, 2015","true","0.9"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

It has variation in superweapons, but no real variation in basic shots, excluding leveling them up and down. From what I saw from the roguelike mode, it didn't add what depth I was hoping for.\n\nIf you reaaaaally like shoot'em'ups, bullet hells, and score attacking, you might like this game more, but I don't really recommend it.\n","October 22, 2015","false","1.6"," 2 of 10 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","2","10","0","0"

Keyboard and mouse work just as good as the gamepad controlls.\n\nThe special weapons allow for some neat little customization tho more would have been nice.\nThe rogue-like mode is pretty interresting as well and a nice addition.\n\nDid I mention the awesome soundtrack?
