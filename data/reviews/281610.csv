In part 1 the intro reveals that alien artifacts have been found within the desert of Kharak which made the construction of a mighty spaceship possible.\nAnd the latest part Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak tells you the story about the search and excavation of the artifacts on the planet Kharak.\n\nGameplay\nYou control some sort of rolling aircraft carrier called Kapisi (your mobile HQ) through the life-threatening world of the planet Kharak. Kapisi allows you to store resources, research technologies, and the production of units. Although Kapisi has the functionality of a base, its mobility helps to set it apart from traditional RTS games. Thus a proper base building does not exist. You're looking for a suitable location and gather resources to enlarge your fleet and to research new technologies.\n\nAbove everything else it's a strategy game. You can use the units from previous missions in upcoming ones, therefore you should keenly collect all resources and build units before moving on to the next mission.\nA unit limit prohibits you from taking too many units to the next mission. Grr.\n\nThe roughly 15 hour long singleplayer campaign is tactically rather moderate and not very rapid. Most importantly you must take over good positions step by step to intercept your enemy, gather artifacts and finally destroy the enemy. In the online mode and skirmish battles everything's much more rapid, there are also 3 different win conditions in the skirmish gamemode.\n\nOtherwise one notices the well executed control system, the fitting sound, the good lighting effects and the breathtaking graphics within the gameplay. In terms of gameplay it's a well made game, though the shortness of the singleplayer campaign and the Interface, which needs getting used to, disturb a bit in the beginning.\n\n\nPros: Breathtaking graphics and great effects thanks to the Unity engine\nSound &. Music fit the game very well and sound great\nEasily learned and uncomplicated unit controls\nGood animations and short video sequences with real actors in between missions\nWell done and very innovative multiplayer mode. Expect tense fights with differing win conditions, like for example destroying the main base, total destruction or the hunt for artifacts (a kind of Capture the Flag)\nGood physics and you can use the terrain to your advantage\nSteam Achievements & Steamcloud\nNeutral: The AI is not completely stupid, but currently only hardly reacts to areal attacks and it's easy to properly position oneself, trick the AI and intercept the constantly reocurring attack pattern.\nThere is no minimap but a tactical interface.\n"Only" 13 singleplayer story missions which are beaten within 12-15 hours on medium difficulty\nCons: Newcomers to the Homeworld Series are left with unanswered questions regarding the story\nInterface and construction menu requires getting used to\nThere is a pretty generous unit limit\n\nConclusion:\nSomeone who likes RTS should take a closer look at this innovative, graphically well done game, but only if one's not only keen on a singleplayer campaign, but also enjoys a few skirmishes or playing online.\n\nThis review was written as a valuation inside of its own genre.\n\n\nTotal rating: 8/10\n\n\nIf you liked this review or want to see more recommended games, be sure to follow our curator group: Follow Original Curator Group","January 20","true","26.9"," 383 of 477 people (80%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","80","383","477","12","34"

Majonez <3 Bonek","http://steamcommunity.com/id/majonez/","80 products in account","I don't usually write reviews, but for this one I just felt I have to.\n\nFirst of all let me super straight - the game brought a lot of positive memories from my past when I spent dozens of hours playing Homeworld, then Homeworld 2 and then the Complex fan-based modification. The graphics, the music, the gameplay, the story, the general vibe of a Homeworld game - it's all there.\n\nUnfortunately there're a lot of other issues with the game that I found rather disappointing. All of them seem to align with what other not-so-excited reviewers are writing.\n\nFirst, campaign length. I've spent about 10 hours playing campaign only. I've tried to obtain every resource available on *all* 13 missions and it only took me less than 10 hours to get this done. I felt quite disappointed when I realised this is it.\n\nSecond, the AI is just, well, dump. There's no real challenge here. Just built dozens of AA units and fear that AI will send ground units only? Don't worry, they'll keep on sending those fighters.\n\nWorry an enemy AA unit will rush to help his friends being bombarded 100 meters away? Don't worry, the AA battery will just nicely sit there, waiting to be eliminated by your ground troops once you clear the area around using air units.\n\nI haven't lost a single mission in this game. Hell, it was more of a... cakewalk.\n\nThird, just five maps in skirmish mode? Really?\n\nSo tl;dr;. Would I spend €46 for this game knowing how short my satisfaction would be? Probably not. Would I recommend it to a die-hard Homeworld fan? Probably yes, but only if you're really willing to spend this amount of cash for a game so short.","January 25","false","9.8"," 261 of 364 people (72%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","72","261","364","8","10"

If you liked the old homeworld games lore, get this one asap. Interesting characters, well written story and dialogue. Did I just write that for a RTS game... Yup lol. Best writing in a RTS since World in Conflict.\n\n- The Atmosphere is very well done, it feels like Homeworld, oozes the whole feel perfectly\n\n\nNegatives Or Things that can be improved:\n\n- The AI needs some work\n\n- More maps would be nice (I have seen today the devs announced free maps are on the way down the road)\n\nIf you prefer a slower RTS, over say Starcraft 2 or if you want a RTS with a great campaign that is well written and  a blast to play, pick this up. Not perfect, but quite a good addition to the RTS genre, especially at a time when RTS games rarely come out and if they do they are usually multiplayer focused, nice to have one doing a good job with the campaign, story and atmosphere. Not as fast paced or twitchy as the popular starcraft2, but at the same time, the multiplayer in starcraft 2 has alot more options.\n\nI will post more impressions and thoughts late on when I have more hours on the game. So far it is very good though! Very Immersive, audio rocks, it looks nice and it is fun to play, despiate the ai issues and lack of maps for multi on launch.","January 21","true","5.2"," 119 of 153 people (78%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","78","119","153","2","8"

It doesn't mean I would tell someone to buy it.\nJust finished the game.  Classic Difficulty.  I had a blast playing it as an old homeworld fan. Won't lie was hoping for something that was more Homeworld: Cataclysm then the other two games.   It feels and plays like a Homeworld game. Each unit has a purpose and excells in that roll, but as far as the campaign is concenred there is a certain point in which anyhting smaller then a Cruiser becomes useless. This is very much Homeworld 2 over the previous games which might turn some off.\nThe hard part though.  Would I tell someone to spend 50$+ on this?  As the game is right now no.  Unless that person is a major homeworld and rts fan there is really no reason to buy this. Even then it is a hard sell.  The campaign is 13 missions long which is fine, but the skirmish and multiplayer as others have said before is where an RTS survives.  The fact the game shipped with 5 maps and a barebones AI which you will notice in the campaign really makes me worry about the longterm survival of this game. That and the lack of marketing on gearbox's front makes me worry that gearbox doesn't expect this to live long either.\nEdit:\n2/1/2016\nThere are now 6 multiplayer maps.  Multiplayer is reciving balance so meta is a bit better now. Ai is still braindead.","January 22","false","20.0"," 259 of 374 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","259","374","0","6"

Every little touch that made Homeworld so memorable is in this game.  Unfortunately, for a $55 dollar price tag this game is woefully lacking in content.  I completed the 13 mission campaign in under 10 hours of playtime.  Whats there to do after that? Not much.  Theres a skirmish mode against an absolutely horrid AI, even on the hardest difficulty.  There is also a multiplayer but the map pool is so tiny (5 maps total? only two of them are for the most played online mode 1v1)  Just bare bones content wise all around.  This is why i cant really recomment this game for this high of a price tag.  There is zero replayability in the campaign, its a once and done kind of thing and the multiplayer is just barren.  Get this if you absolutely need a homeworld fix, but personally id avoid this until it goes on sale for at least 50% off. Just nothing to do in this game.","February 10","false","10.6"," 119 of 161 people (74%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","74","119","161","3","2"

There are obvious problems, especially when it comes to the braindead AI in multiplayer, but if you're someone who's more into singleplayer RTS games, this one is just right for you.\n\nI do have to say that it seemed like I found the exact opposite what everyone else was talking about regarding the campaign, including TotalBiscuit. They said the campaign is very easy, there are too many resources, you get unit types out of the blue without explanation, etc. I found all this to be false, as I had a rough time on Normal difficulty, I was always out of resources, and every single unit type you get is explained. So that particular criticism is weird for me. But maybe it's just me.\n\nSo yeah. I'd recommend this game to RTS fans, and especially those who were fans of the original Homeworld games. It's rare if we get RTS games nowadays, so this is definitely one shining diamond.\n\n(One more note: The game is called -Deserts- of Kharak. So don't be surprised if all the maps are set in a desert.)","January 24","true","11.0"," 80 of 103 people (78%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","78","80","103","4","3"

Great atmosphere, immersion, visual style and music. SUPERB mission design. Every mission is very different without being gimmicky, and offers a wide variety of strategic play. The game favors strategy and tactical control over twitch micro, much like previous Homeworld games. 10/10\n\nWhile somewhat slim on multiplayer features at release, DoK has already had 3 major patches, with a fourth coming this month. The developers continue to support this game with new maps, multiplayer features and balance changes, and DLC. The MP community is rather small, but very friendly and welcoming to new players.\n\nIf I had to find fault with the game, its the occasional bugs in the Public Lobby for custom games. Sometimes there are issues with p2p connectivity, but you can generally resolve them with a restart.\n\nIf you like RTS, Homeworld, or Sci-Fi, buy this game.","March 16","true","378.6"," 102 of 142 people (72%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","72","102","142","12","2"

It has some issues, but there is no core flaws which can make a game unplayable or effect its replayability. Game core mechanics are pretty deep, It has rich solo experience and well thought-out competetive oriented multiplayer. It is defenitely a Homeworld game from Homeworld developers. You can feel the soul of game universe while playing this game thats for sure. Amount of work those guys put in lore, game details and gameplay is huge and you can be sure that project not gonna be droped like some random moneygrab. Get this game and invest in quality game development.\n\nCore mechanics\nGame is defenitely self sufficient as Homeworld game and as real time strategy. There are multiple gameplay layers from terrain to unit active abilities and veterancy system. Solid groundbased strategy overall which can be compared to original Company of heroes.\n\nSolo campaign\nStory is rich, gameplay is really immersive. You have great wrighting, voice acting, awesome cutscenes\videos, unit persistance with veterancy system and pretty intence atmosphere overall. Expedition Guide adds alot for lore guys like me. All you need is a bit of imagination and good headset to dive into desert.\n\nOn the other side difficulty even on classic is not that hard, but game do not hold your hand all the time like TotalBiscuit tells you.\n\nMultiplayer\nInformation about multiplayer was limited before release to say at least and this part of the game come out as a great surprise. You can clearly feel that original Shipbreackers project was oriented on multiplayer. You have 1v1, 2v2 3v3 ladder system with matchmaking and skill tiers. Artifact retreaval game mode in ranked saves this game from passive camping of original annihialtion gamemode of Homeworld multiplayer. Belance is pretty good for a fact that there were no closed\open beta for multyplayer. You can play 2 factions with really good diversity, dont listen to those who tells you that they are all the same. There is no identical units at all and there are huge core differencies in strategy\abilities\unit compositions etc. With great game core mechanics this game have a possibility to became a noticable RTS game like CoH or SupCom. There is no replay and observers system which are essential to form a competetive community around the game. And 5 maps are not enought thats for sure. Devs have a lot of work here if they want to bring this game to competetive standarts.\n\nYou can look at competetive part of the game here - "First Ever Shoutcast! Pro 1v1" from well known Company of Heroes commentators https://youtu.be/XQcZM8-lMMA\n\nThat is all i think, hope it was helpfull.","January 21","true","73.8"," 92 of 129 people (71%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","71","92","129","2","0"

If you're after replayability, hours of skirmishing etc, then go play Homeworld Remastered/Classics\nI've played the Classics since I was a kid back on a 98 os system (all the way through xp and windows 7, I've probably put over a 1000 hours into each) and I've put well over a 100 hours into remastered just so you know that this is an opinion on the game from someone who has been tainted with the previous Homeworlds. A new fans opinion may obviously vary from mine.\n\nI'll start off with the positive:\nThe art style of the cutscenes is fantastic, it's actually something I wish other media would uptake it's so pretty.\nThe music is classic Homeworld, desperate and dramatic tones of orchestra, it's great.\nThere's more dynamic battlechatter (for example when an enemy is detected but not seen units will report they have signals but no visual conformation) which is a very nice touch\nGuard formations are back, (took us this long to get that back?)\nAtmosphere and story is very homeworld, a desperate struggle against a formiddable enemy\nLove the fact Rachel is a unit, any game which lets you some way have a badass chick is usually good in my books\nArtifact recovery is a fun little thing to do, and it's a great asset, they offer great strengthening factors to your fleet\nThe prequel story is very compelling, not to spoil anything but after the end of this I immediately went and started playing Homeworld 1 again\n\nNow the negative:\nThe game looks like ♥♥♥♥ when compared to remastered, even on ultra, ship textures are okay and the explosions are....okay, but the other FX look pretty poor and the sand textures look extremely lat and lifeless, to the point where I look at the screenshots above and scoff.\nCombat has a serious lack of individual unit importance, the only way you can win is mostly by unit spam, you'll throw a lot of the starting units straight to the winds\nThere's no ballistics, at least from what I can tell, rail gun hits seem to be RNG and everything else is just falsely animated when compared to what's actually shooting and what's actually taking damage\nNo docking? No harvester drop off animations? What?\nTERRIBLE unit clipping, like half the stuff on the surface doesn't actually exist, I've got scavengers just driving through the wreck of the Kalash like it's nobodies business\nVery little unit variation both in each race and between the two races, one race hovers and the other doesn't but in terms of combat they are identical\nOnly 5 maps for Skirmish/Online\nThe controls are pretty butchered, unnecessary button changes to a system that was well understood and well loved, and you can't even get that system back because the controls are NOT-REBINDABLE\nNo ALT focusing, making trying to keep an eye on your units in combat even more difficult without them clipping through sand, mountains, bigger units and resources\nUnit target priority is very odd, rail guns will try to shoot tiny fast LAV's while another railgun is killing them, it's like they just defend themselves from what they see first which will ALWAYS be the LAV's\nI know this is precise but, the support carriers guns will all fire when in combat, even if not all of them are on target, so you get bullets just flying off the thing in random directions for no reason\nMissiles and bombs have very random velocities, they'll launch/drop at reasonable speeds but as soon as they get close to a target they'll accelerate to ridiculous speeds and perform seriously unbelieveable changes in direction. I understand a bit of smudging to make stuff like that hit but, this is immersion breaking\nI find very few of the scenarious in the campaign to be imaginative, you've got your standard first mission of testing resourcing, production and the like and from there's it's just been engage and destroy the enemy mostly (as well as the aforementioned artifacts to recover)\nSkirmish AI is both useless and a dirty cheater at harvesting resources much faster than you ever could\nCamera gets stuck at certain zooms sometimes\nSometimes turret animations will simply fail and rounds will come out the back of them instead of through the barrel\n\nOf course some of this can be fixed in patches, we NEED Alt focusing again and we DEFINITELY need rebindable controls, as well as a fix for the buggy clipping, certain odd unit behaviour and some busted animations\n\nMy final word is that I really want to say I enjoyed this, hell I probably did, the campaign (as un-imaginative as it is) is enough to make you want to complete it, but that's pretty much all you're getting. If you're a die-hard Homeworld fan and you want to experience this epic journey of the great expedition then be prepared to experience the feeling of a very rushed game along with it. Buggy animations, unit clipping, fairly certain I've mentioned it all. And it will ruin the immersive moments, even the end of the game was almost ruined for me, as the final scene plays and the beautiful animation style shows us the sky of Kharak, Rachel was saying her piece and was interrupted twice by the blockhead Intel Officer saying "Galsien fighters approaching" even after I'd killed every single last one of them.\n\nI just chose to ignore him (the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥)","January 20","false","27.3"," 423 of 684 people (62%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","62","423","684","24","61"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenuty/recommended/281610/","kenuty","Kenuty","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kenuty/","1340 products in account","As I eagerly launched this title. I had a nostalgia hit me from the series.It felt like a Homeworld game and sounded like one with the superb voice acting, Excellent music and accompanied by beautiful cutscenes. The only downside however was the uninteresting backstory lore of the game and lack of depth in strategy from the opponent. The game is fun and the multiplayer works however there is a shortage of good maps seen.\nThe game is as good as a Homeworld game can get as player control Rachel S'jett along with the coalition to battle the Galsien empire to reach the anomaly before they do on the dying world of Kharak\ncont...\n\nVideo Review https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FlwQOwmKRTw\n\nPros + Great soundtrack as always from the Homeworld series along with top notch voice acting\n+ Battlechatters between units and acknowledgments as the battle wages between two factions the Coalition and the Galsien on the dying planet of Kharak.\n+ Graphics looks good and not too overly done, the game runs really well and feels optimized. Though the texture could use more work but overall the environment of the world of the dieing planet Kharak is full of sand, dunes, tornadoes, and sand storms adding the feeling of immersion.\n+ Units animations such as leaving sand dust when they speed up or blowing up leaving debris and black sand is enjoyable to watch when zoomed in or when units jump over giant dunes.\n+ Cutscenes are beautiful and top notch with cinematic watercoloring type of art along with in game cutscene that adds to the storytelling.\n+ Easy to understand unit counters accompanied by a great tutorial that explains how to play the game and use the camera\n+ Good ui and not overly cluttered along with easily understandable hotkeys.\n+ Multiplayer matches are fun and easy to understand in two modes, carrier destruction or capture the artifact.\n\nCons  - Story was uninteresting and left new players left out on the lore without much proper explanation of the situation one has to be a fan to understand what exactly is going on.\n- Ai in campaign does not respond to your units engagement types and literally cannot counter you, They are also set on predetermined pathing so if you die a mission, you can reload and test yourself and see that they will always go in the same directions or send the same units for situation even on the hardest difficulty. Not entirely dumb but needs rework.\n- Hardest difficulty beaten in seven and a half hours. Without rushing and played by veterans.\n- Cannot bind your keys though will not be a problem for those familiar with strategy games and can learn, the issue will be for left handers and others who cannot put up with the control ( THIS IS A SITUATION THAT CAN BE PATCHED!)\n- No units formations like in the original Homeworld series. (ie no formations at all so your support units can end up in the front and or too far from range to heal your units which sucks. You'll have to manually set them up in position.\n- Multiplayer is very lacking only 5 maps total to fight against your friends/enemy. Hopefully more will be added or a map editor of sort so that we'll have more maps.\n- Lack of strategy depth for units\n\nIn conclusion for those of you who are Homeworld fans you'll like the game, it is good but its not great. I am awaiting a sequel and hopefully see more improvements to Homeworld itself. It is a fun casual game to play online as well as an enjoyable narrative game with a short campaign without overly complex units and strategies. At best it is up to the multiplayer if this game will continue on living but even then the lack of multiplayer modes and map is undesirable and only time will tell if the game will withstand the test of time. There aren't many strategy game these days but this definitely isn't the worst. Hopefully future patches will improve it. Wait for a price drop or get it if you are eager to just play something.","January 22","true","10.4"," 56 of 80 people (70%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","70","56","80","0","0"

The campaign (isn’t mind-blowing anyway) has a great atmosphere, the feeling of being on an expedition in the middle of nowhere, with everything against you. That sense of rush while you're collecting resources for example, not knowing when an enemy patrol may appear through the dunes. Had a great narrative, a superb missions design, the video sequences have a magnificent design (like drawn with a brush, a speed painting between 2D and 3D), an incredible soundtrack... And an interesting plot.\n\nSo why i cannot recommend it? Like the title said, is an indie game (sometimes even one on early access) overpriced. There's a important lack of content for the price its cost. You can beat the awesome campaign in less than 8 hours... and there's no more to do. There's not many units (and not very different aesthetically), only one campaign, the scenarios are incredible (but are similar, ok, a vast desert, you know), the HUD is an schematic and insipid 2D (you don't need to see how the pilots move inside their vehicle like on Starcraft 2 of course, but it makes it quite clear what kind of game it is), the units doesn't speak too much sometimes... Of course you got the skirmish and multiplayer (in fact you just need to look the achievements of the game to see it is the main feature), but only two factions, well, to be fair they're the same with different skins... less than 9 maps and of course only 4 game modes (almost identical)... and by the way, the online mode is dead.\nAnd well... now, they just released a DLC...6.99 to add 4 vehicles to the online mode... well 4 skins more or less. So... again a very overpriced stuff. This is not the correct way to make better the game, or even to bring back a game focused on the online mode. The game need new campaigns, offline campaign.\n\nThe game is great, if you like the original Homeworld you will love this (the game is a mix between Supreme Comander and Ground Control with the Homeworld greatness), if you are a fan of real RTS you will love it too, I do. But the game is not worth that price (25-30 is recommended price, IMO), if you only can buy a game... look for another or wait for a discount (a big one), if you don't care about overpriced games, go for it.","March 23","false","21.4"," 31 of 38 people (82%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","82","31","38","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/NitroAussie/recommended/281610/","NitroAussie","NOC | Onevy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/NitroAussie/","218 products in account","Don't usually do extensive reviews, but thought i would do one since i have a great feeling for this game. This will be short, but certainly will update as i progress more into the game. Thumbs down, Thumbs up or skip as you please after reading, no hard feelings here.\n\n\nFirst and foremost i personally think this game is amazing! I am having a blast with the campaign and the story is actually really fun & exciting. Even the 'cutscenes' are great to watch.. it's like a mini movie getting you pumped before the mission, feeding you with emotions so that you try your best to save 'X' people and do 'X' mission.\n\n\nI will not get to much into the graphics because im not fussy with them. - Graphically, the game is stunning..   i am playing  1920x1080 with all graphical settings set to Ultra, and i must say i am blown away with the amount of detail they have put into the maps, terrain, units and just everything! Even when you zoom down and you can see your units up close and personal, you notice the small details and just appreciate the work they have put into each and every object to make it look very realistic and sophisticated. Ahh.. The lighting and shadows are spot on! It gives you that extra 'real life' feeling to it, i can't explain it much more than that, but everythings looks great so far.\n\nMy PC specifications for those wondering:\n\nProcessor:-    Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600 CPU @ 3.40GHz\nVideo Card:-   NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 Ti\nMemory:-       16 GB Ram\nResolution:-    1920 x 1080\nOperating System:-   Microsoft Windows 10 (build 10240), 64-bit\n\nCampaign/Story - The story so far is actually exciting, and for me that's hard to find in a game. Truth be told, i don't tend to finish many campaings on any game i play.. Usually i just jump straight into Multiplayer and later on try the campaing, don't like it and just go back to playing the Multiplayer section, but 'Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak' has already gotten me hooked.. I for the first time in a long time have just enjoyed playing the campaign and not even thinking of joining an online game. Why? the story line.. like i have said, it's amazing and really fun with some awesome mission, some are simple and some are hard. Also i do suggest giving the tutorial a go for new players, if no you'll have a hard time adjusting to the game when either playing the campaign or multiplayer.\n\n\nAnother thing for now that i shall mention, terrain. It's great to see an RTS game add realistic areas(I'm not saying other games have not done so in the past), for example.. If you are planning to attack a target, you can't just select your units and tell them to attack 'X' units.. Sometimes you have to put them on higher grounds because the terrain isn't always  flat.  Even the smallest hill will make your units just shoot into the sand and do nothing, thus why having to put them onto the perfect location so they can fire and hit their target and have an advantage, and at the same time getting a little cover. This really does give the maps/game the complexity that games like this need. Another thing i love, is with certain heavy tanks you can now 'smoke screen' an area to cut off long ranged attackers hitting your units, this means the enemy has to bring the heavy tanks closer and will make them vulnerable to attack, or make them wait out the smoke and that will mean they're useless for that short battle! Simple things like this make you think!  it's great.\n\n\nLike i said, ill keep updating this review.. but for now this is all i have. Hope this does help for anyone thinking of buying the game - This is more so the positives of the game, because i have not encountered any big negatives thus far.. so i suggest reading other reviews if this has not satisfied you.\n\nSome Gameplay of the first two missions, thought this would also help to choose if you like this sort of game style or not.\n\nMission One:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aeV6grjwumA\n\nMission Two:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfKrscMt_a8\n\nMission Three:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOQKKCBWxcs\n\n\nMultiplayer i will add here when i have played several hours of it.\n\n\nWell, have a great day/night and see you on the battlefield!","January 20","true","12.7"," 56 of 81 people (69%) found this review helpful 8 people found this review funny","69","56","81","8","2"

Yet events conspired to land the Homeworld license in Blackbird Interactive's hands, and instead of starting on a new project, they opted to retroactively fit their existing title into the universe as a prequel.

The story flows well, the cut-scenes are well done, and the tasks in the missions offer some variety. The story itself, as you may no doubt have guessed, follows the progress of the 'Expedition' refrenced in the very first opening sequence of the original Homeworld game. This game wasn't developed by Relic but that certainly doesn't show, at least when it comes to the single player campaign polish.\n\nOther than the single player campaign, the rest of the game leaves a hell of a lot to be desired. The fact that the campaign is only 13 missions long, the first practically being another training mission, in-and-of-itself, doesn't help. Regarding the multiplayer side there are only 6 maps at present to play skirmish games on. When it comes to skirmishes against the computer, the AI in this game is very underwealming and not challenging at all. As for playing against other human opponents there doesn't appear to have been much uptake of this game from other players from a multiplayer perspective as I have searched for nearly an hour trying to find a ranked game, and public lobby games are few and far between.\n\nAll in all, if you're a fan of the Homeworld series I wold recommend waiting until this game is on sale at at least half the price.

I've been a homeworld fan for a long time. This game is Homeworld. It feels like it, it paces like it, It sounds like it, need I go on? I've just completed the campaign, which imo is the only game mode that counts, and there has only been one bug, but was not game breaking as it fixed itself by the next mission. This is my second favourite game in the franchise, right after the original. The campaign is really hard, just like the original and the game doesn't hold your hand and treat you like a ♥♥♥♥♥. If you screw up, you lose. Even on Normal dificulty.

Namely, the endless desert of Kharak. The result is a refreshing take on the RTS formula with superb art direction.\n\nI really love the way this game looks. The mix of the rugged industrial motifs of the ships traveling through the desert and the naval iconography of the aircraft carrier on wheels (which is an idea I just love!) works supremely well. I specifically really adore the fact that the UI is modeled to look exactly like what you would imagine the characters in the game would be looking at on their computer screens. Art and design on this game is top notch and make this game stand out from other RTSs, while still hearkening back to what made the art of the original Homeworld games special.\n\nI also very much like the combat. The two factions in the game are similar enough that you can pick up the other pretty quickly if you've learned one, but also different in very cool ways. The Coalition is great at defending particular locations; they can build turrets and must build stationary logistics modules to increase their fleet. The Gaalsien, in contrast, are all about mobility and covering the map. They can produce units from multiple locations simultaneously and their units generally are quicker and more mobile. They also do not need static logistics beacons because they upgrade their fleet capacity as research on the carrier.\n\nAll of these factors and the "Battlestar Galactica"-esque campaign make for a great complete package. I think this is going to be one of the strategy games we talk about for years.\n\nSee more about the game and my opinions in this pre-release video:\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=604237964","January 20","true","21.4"," 61 of 100 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","61","100","0","3"

A slower paced RTS game with intriguing reverse difficulty and epic lengthy capital ship battles. Whatever you complete your mission with is what you start with in the next mission. And Homeworld was purely in space, and it had some control issues as it wasn't common to play an RTS game in pure 3D space.\n\nThis new Homeworld prequel is a fantastic experience, but plays just like the original -- except everything is on land, thus 2D and easier to control. I recommend playing on hard, for the full experience. I would have to frequently reload an old save if I made a major tactical. But as a fellow game developer with a lot of RTS experience, BBI have done a most impressive job using the Unity engine and putting together the complete package. It performed well with max settings at 2560x1600 resolution.","January 24","true","25.7"," 32 of 48 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","32","48","0","0"

The Gameplay is the typical homeworld style, only this time, its on the ground.  Unlike space where there is nothing to get in the way, the new enviroment this game is set on, offers a fun and great experience, especially since its homeworld.\n\nThe campaign may be short in RTS standard.  but its the missions offers something great.  Keeping the same units you built since the beginning was fun, it always ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off to see my high ranking units get destroyed (mostly because of poor decisions).  I reccomend playing it on classic mode (hardest difficulty) while the AI may not be great, the mission designs somehow finds a while to keep the challenge.  In short, the single player campaign is fun.\n\nNow for skirmish.  like I said before, AI is not great and there are only five maps.  Hopefully BBI or Gearbox will release free DLC maps very soon and allow modding for this (lots of potential for great mods too.  Mad max Mod anyone?)  You may have heard this before in the discussions of this game.  Bad AI, five maps.  In an RTS game that is a big nono.\n\nMultiplayer is, like usual, the best one.  Downside, region lock.  So far I have been only been able to find 1v1 matches 2v2 and 3v3 takes forever, that the only way to find larger matches is through the public server browser, but thanks to the region lock, you barely find anyone (usually juse one match/server is open)  I hope they fix this.\n\nThe game has some weird optimizations, if you have a good computer, a great PC? You will get stuttering, no matter what option you set in the game.  hopefully in a patch they fix this.  Not really surprised that the game will have optimization problems, people did say, Unity Engine (which is what this game is using) has problems running smoothly.\n\nWould I recommend this game?  yes BUT, with the very few features it has (like usual, bad AI, short campaign, five maps) the price it has right now, is not worth it.\n\nIF YOU REALLY WANNA BUY THIS GAME.  you're better off waiting for a sale or looking to other retailers/sites that offers a lower price, like ♥♥♥ or something similar\n\nIf they fix all these issues, mainly the multiplayer region locking, AI, and the fact it has only five maps.  It would be great.\n\n\n+Great campaign\n+beautiful artstyle\n+Good gameplay\n+Good Story\n+Use of terrain/utilizes full 3d enviroments\n+Challenging single player (on classic)\n\n-Short campaign\n-poor optimization\n-five maps on release\n-bad AI\n-region locked multiplayer\n-Price of the game despite how very little features it has","January 25","true","54.5"," 22 of 30 people (73%) found this review helpful","73","22","30","0","0"

I haven't played any others since, though I was most pleased that I decided to pre-order at the last minute before launch to pick up the Homeworld Remastered (plus originals). Kudos to\nBlackbird Interactive for following their hearts and kudos to Gearbox for picking up the whole franchise in the first place (I'm glad someone there saw the potential).\n\nI'll keep this review short and sweet. I'm not a huge RTS player, though I used to enjoy the C&C series (last one being C&C generals).

Set in the period of time leading up to the rediscovery of the Hyperspace Core, it acts as a prequel to the original Homeworld, and has all the atmosphere you'd expect from a Homeworld title.\n\nWhile the campaign is short (I finished in approximately 14 hours, in no particular hurry), the plot is enjoyable and did manage to spring a surprise on me, and the missions throw you the occasional curveball, such as commanding a team operating independently of the main body, with no production facilities. Overall the gameplay is fun and engaging, although I cannot comment on multiplayer as I'm terrible at RTS and just stomp computers while watching pretty explosions.\n\nUnit designs and animations are generally quite good: enemy units explode most satisfyingly, Light Attack Vehicles catch air off the tops of dunes when using speed boost, Baserunners open hatches to drop turrets and sensors, and the carrier launch and recovery sequences have an intricate detail that I just can't help but zoom in to watch. This does make the lack of resource harvesting animations a bit disappointing, however.\nSound design is superb, especially the chatter. During a slow period in an early mission I heard the engineering crew of one vehicle have a friendly argument with their commander.\n\nMy only real complaint is that the main camera doesn't let me zoom out as far as I'd like, so I spent much of the game in sensor view rather than enjoying the desert landscapes, but the developers appear to be taking an active interest in feedback and player suggestions, so there's a good chance this may be fixed.\n\nIf you liked Homeworld and/or Ground Control, you should buy this game.","January 23","true","16.6"," 11 of 13 people (85%) found this review helpful","85","11","13","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/USNS-01/recommended/281610/","USNS-01","Claw","http://steamcommunity.com/id/USNS-01/","237 products in account","Deserts of Kharak is probably one of the best RTS games I've ever played. You woudn't think the Homeworld formula would survive the transition from space to land, but somehow BBI pulled it off. What's left is an ingenious mix of Homewords 1 and 2, Ground Control, and some SupCom. This is defintely a great Multiplayer RTS.\n\nCombat has some rock paper scisors elements, but empthasises micro. Almost every unit has a special ability, which if used correctly can greatly augment its ability to do damage, take it, or support other units. Managing your fleet over the course of an engagement is a rapid fire exercise in getting your positioning right to ensure your damage potential is maxed, managing said abilities, deciding which tech to pursue, and reacting to the enemy. Central to all this is your Carrier. IMHO the DOK Carriers are the best 'player' unit I've ever seen in a game. Not only do they manage research and production like the HW Mothership, they're also an extremely viable combat unit if upgraded throughout a match and paired with a good support fleet. They also act as a resource dropoff and the hangar for your air force, so positioning them is critical as well, in fact you'll probably roam your carrier quite a bit. It's always a sign of a fun and even DOK match when you can end with a carrier showdown. Or with careful placement of artillery and railguns you can snipe them from range, but this requires time and resources.\n\nSingleplayer is good. The story is well told and the cutscene art is beautiful, but it's short. If you're familiar with HW lore or at least the first game, you'll enjoy it. If not, then some of the impact of events can be confusing. The Expedition guide (sold as DLC) can expand on the lore greatly, but I'd only reccomend that for diehard fans who love the fluff. Other than that, there's skirmish with the AI. AI got patched recently so that it's not just a poor cheating system, so that can be a good introduction to gameplay. Skirmishing has questionable longevity though.\n\nLet's talk other content: The number of maps has gone up since launch, but there is still only 1 3v3 map. If you're playing MP, most of your matches will be on it. BBI is working on new maps and other content, but until that changes don't buy if you like map variety. I can live with it because I love the gameplay, but YMMV. There are 2 factions: Coalition and Gaalsien. Coalition are hard hitting, Gaalsien are fast and can build units quicker since they use crusiers for production. Both are fun to play, but most people play Coalition. Both have different versions of similar units, all with different abilities. There's also the Soban fleet pack now, which is based on the Coalition, and a potential future pack which could be  Gaalsien based. Finally, you can't rebind keys, which may be a deal breaker for some (theres talk about fixing that, however).\n\nOverall, I'd reccomend DOK to anyone looking for an RTS that differs from the usual formula. If you like Homeworld, you've probably already bought DOK. The community isn't large, but there are more than enough people who play regularly to get a full match going. I've had immense amounts of fun with the game as it is, more than enough to justify the purchase, and future patches and expansions will only make the game better! But if you're still worried about the amount of maps or any missing features (Spectating, Keybinding, Etc.), I'd reccomend keeping an eye on the game and holding off for a future sale.\n\nIf you love RTS, you owe it to yourself to go carrier hunting sometime in your life!","March 23","true","45.2"," 8 of 8 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","8","8","0","0"

Being a prequel to original Homeworld, the game tells a story of battle between two clans (Coalition and Gaalsien) that hunt some very old and powerful knowledge, hidden in a deadly desert. Not only a story connects these Homeworlds, Deserts of Kharak also descends a wonderful tribal music and stylish movies from origins. But as a game, the new Homeworld part is not about big skirmishes - it’s tidily made RTS that carefully combines different approaches and features from well-known strategy games of past. Imagine if you would play Ground Control 1 in a very lovely Dune-like desert, where Commander APC does unit production/research work and harvesters collect minerals. It's a tactical RTS with some unit heritage from original Homeworlds, where gameplay is about small armies and squads - and this will be a full description of DoK.\n\nP.S. Another Ground Control feature - Coalition looks like Crayven Corporation and uses wheel and crawler terradins, on the contrary while vicious red hoverdines of Gaalsien came directly from Order of the New Dawn.","January 24","true","29.8"," 19 of 29 people (66%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","66","19","29","0","0"

I've played through mission 5. No plot related spoilers ahead, but I like the game and the background story a lot so far.\n\nFirst, the desert environment is beautiful-- dangerous, also, since the enemy AI seems to like to have swarms of a half-dozen units each patrolling around. Recon in force works better than sending out smaller groups to scout.\n\nRachel is in the game as a "Baserunner", which is an engineering unit, but hers can capture enemy units like salvage corvettes used to. The generic baserunners can also build turrets for ground and anti-air, as well as mines and sensors. Rachel can make sensors, but her mines can be manually triggered or used to demolish structures for salvage.\n\nThere's LAVs, which are light scouts; there's tanks (AAVs-- armored assault vehicles?), there's long-range sniper units called railguns, there's support cruisers which repair others and act as the delivery point for resource collectors. There are likely to be bigger attack-oriented cruiser types coming, but I'm just now getting some air units.\n\nCombat is fun and reminds me a lot of Ground Control, which is a pretty good thing. I think I'd like a bit more variety of units, but I'm only a third of the way in. Micro matters a little-- not so much in big battles, since unit AI chooses reasonable targets by itself-- but if you have a railgun plinking away at you from max range, having your LAVs use their speed boost ability can end the threat more quickly.\n\nThe camera is great and you can zoom way in if you like; focusing on a unit works better than in Homeworld-- perhaps the ground helps give a more familiar perspective when comparing tiny LAVs to the huge carrier. For that matter, the zoom out to tactical map showing the landscape in 3D with your units having a glowing blue sensor in taken directly from HW also (including the sound effects). Seems to work pretty OK.","January 20","true","20.9"," 12 of 17 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","12","17","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/liberteer/recommended/281610/","liberteer","Fißtechead","http://steamcommunity.com/id/liberteer/","503 products in account","I had a great discussion with a good buddy of mine, a real proper journalist that writes about games for living. Can you imagine, a person like that managing to survive in Bosnia? We both do gaming reviews and he told me once I've might be suffering from something called "honeymoon period". I've googled it and discovered about specific type of behavior that happens in the first few days / weeks / months of owning something / being in relationship with someone and thinking that your new object of desire is perfect.\n\nAlthough I've tried to discredit his opinion and argument my way out of it, I've managed to notice real proper example of honeymooning while playing Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak. For the first two hours, everything seemed perfect. Two hours later, I've noticed a few distinctive problems. By the end of the tenth hour, I was thinking to myself - how much love do I really feel for this game?\n\nMany, many moons ago, I've played Homeworld. It wasn't a religious devotion at any length, let me assure you, but I've enjoyed it because it gave me another, new and fresh perspective on strategy genre. Remastered collection appeared, but I was a bit too busy getting it (and a bit lazy, let's be honest). It was really exciting to find out about new Homeworld title, a prequel of sort that was in the works. Although they've grounded it to desert planet of Kharak, I didn't mind at all. Every race (and story) needs a planet to lift off from.\n\nThe very first thing I thought to myself looking at all those screenshots: it smells like Spice. It is soooo Dunish.\n\nAnd yes it is. Homeworld: Desert of Kharak screams Dune in a particular way that could appear obvious only to fans of Herbert's epic masterpiece, although there are no sandworms around. Maybe it's just all this sand that gets into your eyes and laser rifles.\n\nCampaign mode is the heart of new Homeworld title. Main storyline is enjoyable, well thought out, segmented in nice chunks that keep your attention. It also respects the legacy of Homeworld titles, but doesn't provide player with any additional information (which is fine, google it or play other Homeworld games). The voice acting delivery helps boosting the atmosphere even higher, it's AAA quality and you can't really complain about anything in that domain.\n\nI've played the campaign on medium difficulty and it proved to be JUST RIGHT for someone like me. But does that mean it's good enough for RTS fans? Nope. Although I do love RTS games, I consider myself to be a complete newbie in the genre that I've been playing for more than two decades. That being said, it would probably be wise to say Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak AI will satisfy undemanding players, but if you know every single nook and cranny in RTS genre, you should seek revolutionary challenge somewhere else.\n\nDifference between Homeworld: DoK and most other RTS titles is the fact that there's no real base building. Your Kapisi base is what Mothership used to be in original Homeworld titles. It is a moving, shooting and self-repairing giant. The whole campaign mode, this traversing the desert reminded me of latest Mad Max movie. Although I like to basebuild my way to victory, traveling, always-on-the-move base Kapisi has its own purpose. The concept of 'base on wheels' has been delivered thoughtfully.\n\nYou'll be running with Coalition and be able to pick antagonists Gaalsien in Skirmish and Multiplayer modes. Although two factions in the game don't differ two much from each other and number of units is not that big, all the units are useful and most of these have additional abilities that expand their usefulness. You will unlock units while playing campaign. This way, you'll learn your way through the game without a hitch. Some people consider number of units to be a bad thing. I don't have any problem with it.\n\nBeside campaign that's done really well, additional options are skirmish and multiplayer. As for multiplayer, I've played press review and just as other reviewers, I didn't get chance to play multiplayer. What all of us could see is that game offers unranked and ranked matches, but how many gamers will compete in DoK, remains to be seen. Skirmish could in a way represent what multiplayer will offer to players. You get a chance to pick your side (Coalition or Gaalsien), your team colors, pick a map and off you go.\n\nNow, few thoughts on a skirmish. Five maps available - unimpressive number that needs to grow as soon as possible if devs really want to kickstart the multiplayer. If BBI and Gearbox can't deliver, they should release the modding tool and let people take care of lack of maps via Steam workshop.\n\nAI isn't that good, but it isn't bad either. I could easily call it lukewarm. Just like in campaign, normal difficulty suits RTS beginners like me. I would call it an entry level AI that makes you think RTS. It makes you learn the genre in a way.\n\nHow much strategy is there in a game? Well, it's hard to say. Maybe it was the space, but I feel original Homeworld titles had more freedom. Truth be told, DoK offers a relatively standards RTS experience. Elevated shooting and domination from above? Seen. Hiding behind the covers? Seen. Only two scavengers per resource? Horrible designing decision.\n\n"But it's all desert! What's impressive about that?" - this could be a valid question about graphic quality of the game. Well, I do think that Homeworld: DoK delivers graphically in every single way. It's dirty, sandy, it makes you believe in desperation of your convoy trying to locate its salvation. Beside already mentioned voice acting, SFX and music are spot on.\n\nTo thumb it up or down, that is the question. I'll say yes because of the story and overall Dune feeling that I felt while playing. Mind that you might not get it at all because Coalition and Gaalsien socio-political relations are not nearly as complicated as those of Dune's characters.\n\nThis is a solid strategy game that managed to elevate itself in several important aspects to match the name it's proudly wearing on its digital sleeve. But getting it for full price just for the sake of campaign and ocassional skirmish and multiplayer is a bit over the top. Let's all be rational here and admit none of us will get hooked on Homeworld skirmish and multiplayer longtime. Don't let me tell you what you should spend your money on, but I personally think this price tag is currently attached to trademark, not the content. If it wasn't for word Homeworld in title, most people would just glance over it in the store, laugh the price off and pass. We've seen enough high quality indie games to dissaprove with almost 50€ price tag. When it goes at least 50% off, grab it.\n\nEDIT: The review has been edited to correct few severe grammar mistakes... no matter how many times I read it...\n\n\n***\n\nHey, you've liked this review?

A good old fashioned homeworld story, great visuals and audio and a compelling narrative make it a lovely way to spend a day or two.\n\nIf I was going to criticise I would say it's nuts and bolts are somewhat lacking, I wouldn't have complained if this was a couple of years after homeworld 2 came out, but it's not and all the bugs and not quite there yet features just aren't as acceptable. One notably annoying missing feature is the lack of formations and positioning that was in homeworld and would have made a big difference in a land based strategy game. And the UI while joyfully reminiscent of the original could have done with a bit more updating and making it really pop and could do with better group management tools to let palyers access abilities easier, that being said it doesn't really get in the way too much so that is a plus.\n\nThe balance is ok, very homeworld 2 rather than 1, it would have been nicer to have a bit more nuance rather than the simplistic rock paper scissors that leave you mashing cruisers at the end. The best of the old homeworld mods that kept the game alive all added depth and complexity making even smaller units useful all the way through the game. It would have been nice for the devs to take some of that onboard with the new game.\n\nOverall its well worth a buy on it's own merit, better than any of the RTS games last year other than the homeworld remasters. I'm pretty happy with it as I would have bought it anyway just to increase the chances we get a third homeworld game, that it's actualy fun is a real plus.","January 23","true","10.2"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

They kept to the old ways of Homeworld story telling if not better in the animated art so kudos to that\n2. I like the concept of ground RTS different for homeworld Space 3d play\n3. Graphics about the same if not better than homeworld 2 remastered\n4. Great sound quality and music score for the desert enviroment not to mention a lot of voice chatter which makes it more lively.\n\nCons:\n1. Styory is nice and all but still feels as though they are lacking depth to it even though if you have played the past homeworld you know the future outcome but there is not much telling of the history or about what goes on much.\n2. Content Biggest peice right here. Lack of unit types and use of said units. The coalition seems to have fewer units than the oposition and lack futher potential of other units. You notice if you get this the main units you will mainly use are armored assault units and rails mainly combined with air units and thats it. Railguns are really the most affective against everything except lack armor and affectivness against light combat units\n3. Campaign is short if played correctly seen people beat it less than the time it took me which was roughly 8 hrs. Won't spoil what happens but mainly just grinding through enemy forces.\n4. Higher ground includes Defense bonus too? higher ground grants damage bonus but should not in any way grant a armor bonus if anything should be less since you are a bigger target.\n5. Lack of multiplayer maps to 5? Really you launch the game that is a RTS with only 5 maps?\n6. Hud interface of Old homeworld to ground RTS bad match up why? the game controls and hud set-up is great for the space one and using arrows is good for that but would recommend WASD for scrolling on a ground rts. This makes the game a bit more difficult to play with this kind of interface for a ground rts not to mention having the right mouse button to pan the camera everywhere can get annoying when sometimes it gets stuck.\n7. Cannot skip a cutscene in game at all everytime i am in the mist of doing something cutscene happens and i lose units or have no control which is very frustrating in a campaign mission.\n8. Controling air-units is abysmal. Why? because you cannot have them all fly to one location to select them all because once they get there and there is no target they auto-return to land then you have to wait until they land and re-launch. This makes them rather difficult to control and grabing them while on the move can be hard sometimes exspecially if you don't want to grab other units while your at it.\n9. Gaalsien have a better tactical and more diverse units than the coalition hands down campaign and multiplayer which makes it unbalanced.\n\nNow don't get me wrong but the Concept of it is great and all but how this was excuteted is abysmal Wish i could get my refund but steams policy says over 2hrs play and no refund but if it was gamestop they would let you beat the game and bring it back and get full refund so thats a shock right there.\n\nI have played the past 3 homeworld games and yes there is 3 and this by far is the worst of them. If you really want this game i would suggest waiting until they drop the price because it is not worth $50.\n\n","January 25","false","7.8"," 20 of 33 people (61%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","61","20","33","0","1"

I didn't think the story would work well, given what we knew from the homeworld 1 manual, etc, and the plot retcons between 1 and 2, but they definately pulled it off.\n\nGameplay-wise, it's a nice translation of the mechanics of the older homeworld games to a 2d plane. outside of some little turrets and sensor posts, there are no structures, everything is built, upgraded, lauched, etc. from a vehicle. Units now have toggleable abilities, which I'm not actively opposed to. It's more micromanagement, but clever use of them can  make a huge difference I'm sure.\n\nThe art direction is rock solid. The Galsians, especially, look fantastic. The environments are as grand as you'd expect from a homeworld game, even if they're on the ground. The sound and music fit well too.\n\nIt's kind of weird that they have cool mythical sounding place names for every dang mountain and valley and sand dune when they've never been there and probably only have known about them since they launched a satellite to map the planet.\n\nAnyway, it's bretty good, would buy again.","February 2","true","12.2"," 9 of 13 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","9","13","0","0"

It punishes hard macro early in the game, you can straight up lose if your opponent does a push\n2. Knowing the army composition of your opponent is vital, just massing low tier units will get absolutly rekted against a few armored vehicles. This adds a great dynamic.\n3. The multiplayer is brutal and unforgiving, if you ♥♥♥♥ up, you lose.\n\nIts just really solid, i don't care if its not innovative, its a great competitive game with alot of depth. Artifact retrieval, which to me just sounded annoying at first is actually a great deal of fun. The game encourages players to be active all the time, just turtling to the lategame is not an option!\n\nI've seen some reviewers note that the game is not worth the money because of its lack of innovation, hell, i don't need flashy new weird gameplay mechanics, i just want a solid competitive game that is brutal and punishes mistakes, this one does it, i hope the competitive scene will keep expanding in the coming months.\n\nThe only major negative point is, if one player has a bad connection, it will pause the game every few seconds without dropping him from the game.

I also own the remastered editions and enjoy those as well.  I also wish this review system allowed more than just a Up or Down ... but since it does I have to give it a Down because I WOULDN'T recommend this game for its full price.\n\nSo let's start off with the good.  The graphics are great.  They aren't taxing or mind-blowingly realistic, but for Homeworld they really fit.  The cinematics in the game fit well, and are a step up from the previous games.  They feature actual animation and fit in very well to the atmosphere of the game and the setting.  The music is very solid and has the normal Homeworld vibe to it.  The Rock/Paper/Scissor system used for the units is a bit standard but at the same time the units offer some more advanced options for abilities that allows greater strategic uses of unit.  Nothing crazy in-depth or complicated, but enough that you can do things like hit and run with some units.  The amount of units comes off as a bit limited at first but eventually you unlock a few more through gameplay, very similar to the other Homeworld games.  The carriers themselves are great additions to the game.  They're more than just your base of operations, they are slowly moving super units in and of themselves.  There's a system for changing up what you want your carrier to do by diverting limited power to weapons or repair systems, ect.  Still, it's a nice change from Homeworld where the mothership was little more than an anchor around your fleet's legs.\n\nSo why the "No" recommendation?  Sadly it comes down to the amount of playability I got out of it.  For $50 I kind of expected more than a 9 hour campaign.  Now I know you can play multiplayer but that's not really my thing.  I bought this game today and finished it by tonight.  I didn't rush through anything, either.  I'm fairly meticulous when it comes to the Homeworld games, to the point that I NEED to get every resource before I leave to the next level.  So my 9 hours could quite easily be closer to 7 for the non-OCD types.\n\nThe game was great except for that.  I enjoyed the story, although I already knew the end (duh) and it was a bit predictable.  There just wasn't enough meat in this sandwich to garner the $50 tag.\n\nTL;DR:  I recommend putting this on your wishlist for a sale.  I'd say a $25 to $30 price point is fair for this game.  I'll amend my review if it comes out with more content, but I really doubt that's going to happen.","January 21","false","9.1"," 30 of 54 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","30","54","0","0"

Set on Kharak - the HW series planet of origin, the latest installment is an excellent prequel to the events of the homeworld series. Set on the harsh desert world of Kharak, the sands of said planet are in a very odd and unexpected way interchangable with the cold vacum of space from the original games; both are hostile environments inhospitable to man. This is why Deserts works so well, it retains the feel and massive scale of the homeworld universe, the art style, the lore and backstory but fleshes it out for ground combat. Would recommend for anyone who enjoyed the original HW games or to anyone who enjoyed Dune in its many multmedia guises, similarily if anyone was thinking about buying HW remastered start instead with Deserts of Kharak, then migrate into space - the RTS equivelant of doing ME 1, ME 2 and then ME 3 and keeping the same character throughout!","April 4","true","17.4"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

Deserts of Kharak, although being land based game does a good job (in the campaign) at using some of the mechanics it inherited from its pre-decessors and at keeping the Homeworld lore interesting, for that reason alone i would recommend this game to anyone interested in a compelling story although i would recommend playing the original Homeworld first since it fills in some of the blanks even though Deserts of Kharak is a prequel.\n\nPros:\n+Beautifful to look at graphics\n+Impressive artistic style used for the cinematics\n+Interesting story\n+Units and resources that are lost or kept during a mission will affect the next one during the campaign (inherited from previous Homeworlds)\n+Easy to learn User interface\n+Tactical Map\n+Interesting units and factions\n+Terrain level (sand dunes, cliffs, etc...) can be vital during a battle\n+Unit gouping is essential for the limited available micromanagement\n\nCons:\n- Multiplayer is region locked so public game lobby is a bit barren\n- Global chat seems to fail to update sometimes and your left with what was typed 30 minutes ago\n- Multiplayer synchronisation errors (happens often)\n- No display of player's ping (so people know who is causing the connection issue if it's not the actual game that is the problem)\n- Unknown errors (e.g. During a match one team randomly gets a message that they won the match and can only leave the game while the other team is still able to play)\n- Skirmish synchronisation errors (only happened twice)\n- Poorly optimised matchmaking\n- Hosting a match can sometimes be impossible because for some reason the start button is locked (happens a lot)\n- Skirmish AI doens't provide enough challenge with the exception of the highest difficulty where its feels like slightly borderline cheating (campaign AI is a bit more competent but best played on highest difficulty)\n- Lacks unit formations like previous Homeworld games\n-Multiplayer and Skirmish are limited to 5 maps\n\nNeutral:\n= Short Campaign\n= Only 2 Factions available\n= Low unit capacity which can limit micromanagement (although it makes unit choices a bit more important)\n= No refresh button on public game lobby (its more of a personal con since to me its a stress button)\n= Ground units sometimes fall from the sky (e.g. first campaign mission and my carrier drops from the sky into the docks)\n\nJust as i said above i recommend this game for those interested in a compelling yet slightly short story but at the moment i can not and will not recommend this game for those looking for a good multiplayer RTS experience.\n\nDeserts of Kharak tries to bring forth some life into a barren planet but the question is how long will that life last in such arid conditions and will it be able to adapt or evolve or will it end up being forsaken just like many others.","January 23","true","18.2"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

A few changes along the timeline to make the Northern/Southern war at the same time of the Expedition really is fine by me.\n\nThe unit chatter is back and better than ever, I like how the game encourages you to conserve units, and having a Concordat Cycle that helps but does not fully hinder if you get it wrong is a bonus. Terrain for combat is starting to get interesting, although I feel this system and engine would be better served if licensed and adapted to another setting that has way more map and terrain variety.\n\nI have yet to complete this game, but it's become a very nice routine thus far to play a mission or two before getting ready and departing for work. Having no interest in playing multiplayer, the weak AI complaints fall upon deaf ears here.\n\nOf course, I'm playing on the lowest difficulty and getting my ♥♥♥♥ kicked at times. It's been a long while since I tried to play an RTS straight, having been over on Paradox games for the longest time. Tactical isn't my forte, Strategic is - yet Deserts of Kharak is fun and enjoyable, and unlike other games it feels like it's helping me learn how to properly use units and tactics. The missions might be getting harder, but I feel that I'm getting better as well.\n\nI don't think I've any complaints for this game at all.","January 23","true","15.8"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

Given the 'all deserts all the time' asthetic I would have liked to see some more environmental hazards, sand storms that take big chunks of the map and reduce visibility and do some damage, steeper dunes actually having a chance of collapsing on units, wind managing to shift dunes around a bit.\n\nGraphics and sound are both excellent, they did a good job of making the desert seem visually distinct. The sound design was a lovely return to form.\n\nThe campain was fun, not so short that I have any complaints and I'm certainly left wanting more time in the deserts after that.","January 23","true","20.0"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

The production value of the campaign and the game as a whole is better then most AAA titles. IF they can charge 30 pounds for the remastered edition then surely 30 pound for a new game made from scratch is not too much to ask.\nThe music, the speech, the graphics, and general theme of the game is outstanding.\n\nI really appreciate a game that is well polished and this is it, the little touches are what made me love homeworld and the same effort has been put into this.\n\nJust for an example the unit speech when you issue commands. Sounds like a small thing but when you are selecting and moving units constantly an annoying sounding unit can become grading. With homeworld: Deserts of Kharak you never get tired of hearing the units give out scan readings and comfirmations. Even while idle the units talk to each other, one will talk of a local reading and ask another to confirm it which they do. You will be told when enemy units are spotted when a unit dies, everything, but it doesnt feel like too much. It feels like a real warzone with alot of information being relayed.\n\nThings like that remind of command and conquer, dawn of war and some of the other best strategy games ive played.\n\nI was never one for multiplayer strategy games so i cannot speak for that. I prefer campaigns and this one is great. The cutscenes are not quite starcraft 2 but have their own charm. They create a sense of atmosphere that i have only encountered in homeworld itself. The idea of scale, discovering a large thing out in the desert and seeing one of your tiny light attack vehicle next to it.\n\nAs for the actual gameplay, its smart. Homeworld had a unique style to it and this follows that path and i love it. You dont control a base as such, you dont build buildings. Instead you have a convoy. One main cruiser which produces your troops and handles research. Then other support vehicles can be built. All of your resources collected, units built, research carries over to the next mission. So you get this feeling that you are literally a convoy moving towards the main objective of the campaign, getting bigger along the way. The missions are fun, each one has a twist, starcraft 2 had a similar method which made me enjoy it so much. The mission is never just kill the enemy. You have to scan things, protect things and such. They add things like tornadoes to the mix to keep you on your toes.\n\nIf you want multiplayer this might not be for you, ive heard theres not much going on with it. If you like campaigns then i would highly recommend. Its worth a try you will learn quickly if you like the style of gameplay. PLus if you enjoy it you have homeworld 1 and 2 to play.","April 10","true","12.1"," 5 of 6 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","5","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/maestrodraven/recommended/281610/","maestrodraven","MaestroDRAVEN","http://steamcommunity.com/id/maestrodraven/","282 products in account","One of the biggest surprises of the new year is Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak, a prequel to the original Homeworld that has long remained an icon of PC-based strategy warfare titles.  DOK abandons the vast emptiness of outer space for the sand-choked deserts of the ill-fated planet Kharak, and tells the story of how the people came to locate the ancient anomaly that would give rise to their exodus towards their titular homeworld.  The switch to ground-based strategy gameplay is a definite change from the 3-dimensional tactics one could employ in space, but it's not without merit.  Here, Gearbox selects elements from Homeworld's pedigree and marries them to elevation tactics from other notable strategy games.  Thus, elevation becomes a driving force behind victory over enemy units.  It's a fanciful, albeit simplistic way of approaching combat, but it does come at a cost.  DOK's stripped down "for everyone" approach means that some important elements such as battle formations have been jettisoned, reducing the level of depth that Homeworld veterans may be accustomed too.  It's a bit jarring, and makes DOK feel more like a mini-episode in a much larger storyline.\n\nThe game focuses heavily on short and long-ranged units almost specifically, forcing players to mix up units in order to guard and attack.  Naturally, enemies can attack from all directions, and the relative shortage of resources (or should I say, compartmentalized resources) means that there isn't a lot of elbow room to establish bank-breaking fleets as seen in the original Homeworld games.  Researching new technologies is on a need-to-do basis, and therefore feels a tad linear.  The speed of the game has also changed as well.  Units build much faster, research takes far less than it used to, and enemies race in out of nowhere.  Is this an attempt to court players with less-than-stellar attention spans?  Perhaps!\n\nIronically, it's a magnificent game despite the narrowed and more centralized gameplay mechanics.  I'm hoping that future chapters in the Homeworld saga won't go this route, but for a game set on the surface of a planet, instead of outer space, it's an admirable and enjoyable entry in the franchise.  Let's face it.  There's a criminal lack of Homeworld games for us to play, and this is the first true sequel in over a decade.  Who are we to complain?  DOK retains the signature Homeworld atmosphere, music and visual styles of previous games, and it's nice to see unit designs giving nods to what will eventually become spacefaring Kushan fighters, capital ships and destroyers.  It's like going back to the beginning to a world where little is left.  The dry sands of Kharak are a perfect backdrop for a pretty good (but not stellar) story, and a nice little glimpse into the richness of Homeworld's still mysterious storyline.\n\nRECOMMENDED!","January 20","true","6.2"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

You produce "capital" crawlers in the same vein as capital ships in previous titles, and use a mix of light and medium units in the same vein as Fighters/Corvettes/Frigates.\n\nPositioning is still "3D" in the sense that using proper elevation can yield significant bonuses in combat, and epxanding your sensor net and keeping intel on the enemy, as in previous titles, is key. If anything, I find the gameplay more enjoyable than even Homeworld 2, as combat is accessible, properly paced, and still leaves ample room for tactics and positioning.\n\nGraphic and sound design is SUPERB. There are FEW RTS titles that capture the atmosphere quite like this game does. Lighting and specular design is amazing, the desert maps are incredibly detailed and somehow still offer plenty of visual variety. Units are highly detailed and the wreckage and scorched earth of an engagement are satisfying. The unit chatter and tiny details in audio design only add to the effect.\n\nThis is a superb evolution of the homeworld series and the RTS genre.

It was released for Steam on January 20th, 2016 for $49.99. A press review copy was provided for The Hidden Levels.\n\nHomeworld:Deserts of Kharak is a Real time strategy game and the follow up to Homeworld: Remastered which debuted at PAX South in 2015. The game is set as the title suggests in the desert. You are in control of what can only be described as a “giant aircraft carrier which can move on desert sand”. The campaign is relatively rich in story albeit militaristic and choppy in tone it does manage to capture your attention. The mechanics are somewhat simple and shallow for a full RTS but that adds a meta game element to the potential multiplayer battles.\n\nWhat I enjoyed:\n\nKeeping it simple – Deserts of Kharak doesn’t have a ridiculously deep unit type count nor a wide variety of ranges on those unit types. It has three, and each counters one of the others similar to rock, paper, scissors in that none of the three are overall superior. This was initially a bit of a let down but in the aspect of game design it’s a relatively solid strategy. This type of limitation encourages players to think critically without knowing a rich meta-game or end game strategy like other RTS games require.\n\nDune tunes – The audio and music in the game are well done to a point I felt immersed in the desert once I really sunk into the game. The militaristic style of the game isn’t exactly my personal style, but it’s well done in that I was annoyed by the commanders barking orders at me genuinely. The weapon sounds are also well done and not overzealous like RTS games tend to be so ultimately the audio in the game was clearly part of the cohesive design strategy.\n\nReal time real issues – The premise of the game towards the beginning is that the desert and it’s storms are taking over a planet. This is a relatively topical theme weather is was intended or not since global climate is such a hot button issue. The other issues that come up in dialogue suggest that the environment is incredibly important and not to be taken for granted. It’s an interesting notion to think what would happen should a planet begin to slowly evolve into a desert.\n\nWhat I disliked:\n\nSandy voices – The voice overs while convincing were speaking in choppy military speak which started to sound less than human. The dialogue really was a bit of an annoyance to me in terms of how it was written and delivered. The voice acting was likely directed in this course but I can’t help but feeling like it was a less than human performance. The multiple five word sentences and unnaturally bureaucratic tone repeating over and over was irritating.\n\nSunburnt AI – The AI enemies in the game don’t tend to make very logical decisions nor seem to play well against humans. This is a complaint I’ve heard from other reviewers in discussions about the game and it leads to a bigger overall issue. The game with poor AI then relies on the player base to enrich it via multiplayer games. I have some issues with any game that can’t stand alone without an internet connection unless it’s design is purely meant to be human vs. human.\n\nHomeworld:Deserts of Kharak does have some great moments and fun aspects which are worth taking a look at eventually. I can’t encourage anyone to purchase a game at such a high price point without a better AI or certain multiplayer following. I’d like to think people will see the use of the three unit types as a good limitation of design but ultimately my thoughts are that they will stick with the bigger deeper RTS titles on the market. Relying on us to populate the multiplayer for replay value is a bold choice and forces the mode upon anyone looking to get their full value. I am simply not sure that the game will have enough of a following to garner that sort of multiplayer presence which is a major contributor to my score to wait until the next Steam sale for this one.\n\nScore: Wait for a Sale","February 14","true","1.4"," 17 of 30 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","17","30","0","0"

This game didn't start out as a Kharak story; it started out as just a new RTS game by Blackbird Interactive which consisted largely of the original Homeworld team. When the Homeworld franchise was auctioned off (again) by Gearbox, Gearbox tracked down Blackbird Interactive and partnered up with them to get their RTS game reconstructed to be a Homeworld prequel. It took all of a year or two to rewrite the storyline and plot and apply narration (etc) assets for it.\n\nThe good:\nBeautiful game matching the aesthetics overall of Homeworld.\nBrillliant artwork, graphics, music, sound, narriation/acting.\nGameplay mechanics very similar to Homeworld.\nFun mechanics, very playable and fun game.\n[Barely] satisfying campaign length. (Could be longer, feels rushed, but generally satisfying-ish.)\n\nThe bad:\nNo true 3D gameplay (but definitely 3D terrain if that matters, along the lines of Starcraft)\nInfuriating glitches such as aircraft needing to be double-clicked (while they're moving in flight, good luck) and "reminded" to land and rearm.\nAuto-save checkpoints immediately precede long cutscenes that can't be skipped; you must remember to save after every cutscene if you don't want to repeat them.\nPlot and game ending triggers block resource collection for building up for next mission.\nMassive narrative plothole at ending requires a complete understanding of the first level of Homeworld 1 before can it be understood to say nothing of being appreciated.\n\nConclusion:\nI have mixed feelings about this game. Overall, it's a good game, generally satisfying for the Homeworld fan, as the essential gameplay elements that made Homeworld great (other than total 3D strategy) are here. If you're a Homeworld fan, there's not enough to hate here to avoid it. You'll like it.","April 11","true","16.0"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Ignore the small unit roster - each unit occupies a very specific role and has nuance and depth in their usage.  Ignore the "boring desert maps" complaints of others - the desert is a hidden unit in your army.  Its dunes will shield your vulnerable units, and their peaks will give your killers their perfect shots.  If you cooperate with the desert and allow it to shape your play, you will be victorious.  If you disregard it, you will be punished by the opponent who doesn't.  Ignore the "two factions are very similar" complaint, because that couldn't be further from the truth - while each faction has analogous units that ostensibly occupy similar roles, they end up functioning and feeling very different in practice.  I would be highly surprised if anyone making that statement has as much time with the game playing both factions as I do.\n\nThe BW similarities come in the form of the incredible lethality and power of the tools at your disposal.  Everything is overpowered, therefore nothing is overpowered.  One well-placed unit executing a properly positioned ability can decimate an entire army.\n\nUnlike Broodwar and unlike many other RTSes that come before, this game is far more about how you use your units than anything else.  You don't need 500 APM, you don't have to have 10 minute long build orders memorized.  If your opener is even slightly optimized, you will never face a situation where you are defenseless - you will never face a coin-flip loss.  You can defeat much larger forces than your own with a few well-controlled units.  You will spend 90% of your time in a multiplayer match watching your army and controlling it, and 10% or less managing your economy and research.  The flow of gameplay results in a smooth and pure tactical experience.\n\nIf you are a serious competitive RTS gamer, do yourself a huge favor and buy this game.  Ignore the region lock nonsense - sure, it's hampering ranked matchmaking, but nothing is stopping you from joining public matches and enjoying this incredibly tactically nuanced experience.\n\nAs more maps are added and other mp issues get ironed out, this game will become a true masterpiece as a competitive MP rts goes.  Don't be left out.  You won't regret buying HWDOK.","January 27","true","117.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

The storyline is the best I've seen in an RTS in a very long time; this game is (or should be) all about the single player campaign. The multiplayer is fairly standard.\n\nThe thing that keeps me so intrigued by this game is the "land carrier" concept. The way it's presented, the way they show the lives of the crew and the struggle they have to go through to keep things together, reminds me a lot of the new Battlestar Galactica in its concept. I've always been a fan of huge ships going on an epic journey, weathering direct fire and scrambling fighters; this game gives you the unique ground equivalent of BSG, more or less.\n\nFor anyone who enjoyed Homeworld OR Battlestar Galactica and enjoys a heavily story-driven single-player campaign, with a small amount of fun to be had with multiplayer (maybe more than a little fun if you play it with friends), I can HIGHLY recommend this game. The mechanics are tight, there aren't any serious bugs, the music is awesome, the sound effects are satisfying, and the general concept of "I'm commanding a massive land carrier that's a mobile city" is just so... AWESOME... that I'm excited to recommend this game as one of the few games that has truly given me joy in the past few years.\n\nThe team who created this game should also kindly shut up and take my money for Homeworld 3 and begin development right away (if they haven't already). This is exactly the team of artists, writers and developers -- the exact people who made this game -- that we sorely need to stick together to make the NEXT epic Homeworld game. Do it.

The unit strengths and weaknesses are easy to understand, without getting over complicated.\n- Sound is, as always in a Homeworld game, excellent. The background unit chatter makes the forces at your command more than a collection of dots on a map.\n- Music deserves it's own entry, it fits the tone wonderfully, giving a sense of the open waste of desert, or the thrill of combat. I WILL be getting the OST.\n- Unit designs are cool, from the zippy Strike vehicles, to the lumbering Carrier. Not many games get me to want to own replicas, but dammit, I want a model of that Carrier on my desk!\n\nCons:\n- Occasional oddities of units moving inside of each other, mostly noticable on the Salvagers while collecting resources. Not a big issue, but it would be nice to see it patched out.\n- VERY rarely I would notice enemy units jerking around, instead of smoothly moving. This has only happened once however, on one mission, one playthrough. I have yet to replicate it on any other mission, or on the same mission when I restarted it.\n-In engine cinematics. I love them, they're well done, add to the story, and look nice... BUT YOU CAN'T SKIP THEM. Seriously, non skippable cinematics in 2016? I am dissapoint.

Because it's a bit like meeting an old friend you haven't seen for many many years, and quite frankly feared had died. A friend that was a blast to hang out with in his old spaced out days, but now it seems he has become a well grounded individual (if you catch my drift). Does this make your old friend a bit dull now? Hell no. DoK looks, feels, sounds, and plays just as you would expect a Homeworld game to, irrespective of not being in space. But most importantly it's fun.\n\nIf you like RTS games, or are new to them then I would suggest you check out reviews and game play videos on YouTube. As HW relies on a mobile fabrication and persistent fleet mechanic with limited resources that make spamming units a pretty much redundant and counter productive strategy. Which is not to everyone's liking. Make your own mind up, don't let me or anyone else tell you what's good or bad.\n\nAlso bear in mind this is not a AAA game, and as such I think some people had unrealistically high expectations, and/or no past experience of HW1, 2, and Cataclysm. The game looks great, runs fine on my medium rig with settings on ultra, and no crashes to report.\n\nHowever, there are some tweaking issues within the game at launch, which seems pretty much the norm (an additional month or two in production wouldn't have gone amiss), but can be fixed with patching. BBI have already stated they are going to support/patch and add DLC, so the game can only get better. Plus DoK opens up sooo many possible future game avenues for the Homeworld series to pursue, which has to be a good thing for the franchise, and fans alike.\n\nThanks BBI and Gearbox for resuscitating the Homeworld universe.

That said, this is a fun game, but I feel its lacking in a lot of the things that made the Homeworld series amazing.  Part of what I loved about the series was the details they put in, for instance how every ship could be seen actually undocking or docking, even the capital ships, and the resource collectors actually had to dock to drop off supplies.  In this game, most of the ships come out of the right spots on the carrier, but when you retire ships they just drive under the carrier, not into the ramp on the back, and the resource collectors just have to touch the carrier or supply ships, not actually dock with them.  They are all small things, but I feel they are a major part of what made the original games so good.  Also, some of the controls or commands for ships are either missing, or badly done.  For instance there is no patrol option, if you queue up too many build orders on base runners they often get messed up, especially if you don't keep that many resources on hand(when you give it the order to build something, it doesn't subtract the resources from your total until the base runner actually gets there).\nOverall, yes I would recommend this game if you are a fan of RTS and/or Homeworld, but I feel they could have done better on it by focusing on a few more details.","January 24","true","9.4"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

You cannot just spam endless units to win the day, instead tactics, strategy and efficient use of a maps resources are the name of the game.

Im not ashamed to admit I lost a few battles because I was too busy watching things move, wheels turn and turrets deploy =)\n\nThere is the occassional silliness of an obviously very heavy vehicle flipping end over end when going over an obstacle, but aside from my making me chuckle it doesnt seem to effect gameplay, least it hasnt for me.\n\nAlso - the unit chatter, the ambient chatter - Ive never experienced something such as this in an RTS game - it feels completely alive - you can really believe all those units you're moving around have living, breathing people working inside them.\n\nMy short two hours in game took me to the 4th capaign mission if I recall - and its been a very cool experience all the way.\n\nIf you liked Ground Control and Homeworld, if you like RTS games, if you like the idea of a sort of psuedo Supreme Commander 'lite' (ie: no base building, but large strategic maps and terrain control, similiar play style, rock/paper/scissors style to a large degree) - you cant go wrong here.\n\nIt looks great, it sounds great, the units are interesting and fun and just plain old fun to watch - I cant wait to get further in =)\n\n","January 20","true","11.0"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

Great cutscenes, story and progression. The whole way through the singleplayer is a blast.\n\nThe combat in Kharak is simplistic but well refined, and follows basic unit-counter mechanics alongside the strategic use of the terrain itself (line of sight and height advantages). It's also awesome to watch a clash of assorted dune-machines blast away at each other, presentation is top notch. The atmosphere this game has with its audio is also second-to-none.\n\nUnfortunately the multiplayer community took a large and rather devastating explosive warhead on launch when the game was tied to Steam region-based matchmaking servers. This region-locked the community, and alongside a few multiplayer connection bugs that prevented games starting in the first place the online playerbase plummeted, you couldn't reliably find and play a game. A shame this is, as Kharak's multiplayer is actually really good. It's a fast paced, skillful and sleek tactical RTS arena.\n\nDue to the (now fixed) initial multiplayer launch issues and resultant lack of players, if you want to have a multiplayer game you'll need to go hunting for people in the forums or on steam etc. I have accumulated a small bunch of Steam friends who I can play a game with on a regular basis, but you need to go hunting, trying to search solo will net negative results.\n\nUltimately I would recommend Deserts of Kharak to any fan of the Homeworld series or RTS genre, although perhaps not at full price. A game you should pick up during a sale without hesitation.","May 15","true","65.3"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

The campaign has already been covered well  by other reviews.\n\nIts a bit rushed and rough around the edges, (no key binding, few maps, occasional animation glitches etc.) but the developer hasn't given up on it yet and are planning future updates to fix bugs, balance gameplay, and add new maps.\n\nThe core game mechanics for online multiplayer are solid. Taking advantage of terrain and scouting are critical to success. Good tactics can and will beat high Actions Per Minute and larger armies in this game. Though there are fewer units available than in other homeworld titles almost every unit has multiple purposes. For example the Gaalsien missile ship is a standard AA unit but also has an EMP motar that can disable ground units.\n\nIf you are looking for an RTS that is truly tactical you should give this one a try. If not now, at least when it goes on sale.","February 21","true","182.9"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

The campaign is surprisingly good with great little cutscenes connecting each mission, some great writing on the dialogue and the art style is fantastic, it's incredibly immersive and the radio chatter is amazing to listen to as it's so varied. Small niggles about the annoying camera controls, your viewpoint feels too close to the battlefield especially when hills and mountains come into view, it's missing vital features which every RTS cannot do without and several other things they need to tweak and fix, but judging by their official forum they're already hard at work on more maps and fixes and improvements.\n\nIt's a good solid return to the brilliant setting of Homeworld and I hope BBI continue to add and improve upon it. It's a safe addition to the Homeworld series but I just wish BBI did more with the time they spent on this game, it's good but not as great as it could have been.\n\nSo, basically. What's great is the story, voice acting, dialogue, music, gameplay, immersive both visually and through its audio and easily replayable either through mastering the harder difficulty of the campaign because the gameplay is so enjoyable or multiplayer to see how cunning other Homeworld fans can be!","January 24","true","18.5"," 7 of 11 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","7","11","0","0"

While it is true that there are not a lot of each, this game has done a good job with adding some depth to standard RTS elements to give what the Homeworld series was originally known for - tactical strategy.\n\nThe individual units in the game can level up, increasing their power, armor, etc. Research also allows for various special abilities, so the base units in the game can really be customized and used in a variety of ways.\n\nThe mobile carrier that is your main base is an interesting change to traditional RTS where you have to build stagnant bases. This is where you build your fleet and research, but you can also customize the abilities of the carrier to make it tougher, a repair hub and/or a strong defensive base.\n\nI'm only about 1.5 hours into playing the game so far but wanted to give my initial review. Personally, I'll be keeping this game. While it may not be worth a full $50, I got it with the remastered package, so all together they are well worth it.\n\nI do hope the game will expand with some additional content in the coming months - more map variety and maybe a few more units couldn't hurt. However, I'll still be happy with this game without it.\n\nHonestly, my biggest complaint about the game is the graphics. They're not horrible but they're not great either. They don't feel like an A+ title in 2016 (close-up shots during the cutscenes show gradients realy bad, for example). However, during normal gameplay, the graphics are decent and have a nice feel.\n\nOverall, if you enjoy RTS games (especially if you like on-the-go combat) and/or are a fan of the Homeworld series, I would recommend DoK.","January 20","true","14.1"," 11 of 19 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","11","19","0","0"

The only major element that comprises every homeworld game is the compelling storyline. As the storyline is good, I wouldn't say it is great compared  to HW1, HW:C and HW2 (I liked HW2 very much as compared to many people). Also, the feeling of lack of mysticism. Where the feeling of mystery existed in every Homeworld game before this, DoK has a profound lack of mystery surrounding the ancient ships buried in the sand and the artifacts that are collected. The artifacts are just passed off as Carrier Upgrades, and no further explanation or depth is given to them. Also, in HW1, there were many other different factions whom the Kushan encounter, and even mysterious ancient objects that pose a formidable obstacle to your journey. The ending itself feels really rushed and it seems like the devs quickly wrapped it up so it could ship fast instead of expanding the end a little more.\n\nI did not quite like the physics of the game as many a time I have seen the entire Kapisi standing with its head up when the immediate area was filled with units. Also, disappointing unit animations. As compared to the original HW, the ballistics can sometimes make no sense at all. I have seen a railgun not firing in the direction of an enemy yet the enemy gets damage. Gameplay itself was fun.\n\nA better game than HW1, HW2 or HW:C?

I am not a pro level player at rts games but find them fun and love building armies to fight someone with I have played this game currently to mission 5 and am loving the story the pacing and  tactical view is so cool. now I will say pros and cons  both for this game. + gameplay is amazing and audio and sound design is exceptional. + story and cutscenes are some of the best ive seen in an rts game even the mid mission cutscenes are very interesting. + controls and interface are pretty simple and standard for an rts game. - no rebindable hotkeys and hotkeys are not easy 2 learn for a new homeworld player such as my self.- this is a small gripe of mine but  salvigers do not auto collect near by resources  looking into this online it appears in the old classic homeworld games pressing h will set  them to auto collect this oversite seems like a small negative but its not a big deal.  and can be fixed in a patch. overall this game is amazing and should be played by any rts fan  ps people complaining about 5 maps honestly who cares about map amount in a rts its balance and skill that matters also if anyone wants 2 play some multiplayer for fun message me me on steam as ive yet to se the multiplayer content","January 25","true","12.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

The feeling of isolation and limited resources is really nice. The persistent units and veterancy helps with giving you a sense of what is at stake.\n\nHowever it is short, and the AI isn't anything special but is challenging enough in the campaign as it can spawn tons of units and is heavily scripted.\n\nSkirmish isn't great, as there's too few maps and the AI cannot counter air units and in general isn't very good.\n\nMultiplayer isn't great either. The tech tree isn't entirely visible, so you'll have to memorize it while the gameplay is mostly focused on "getting a bigger blob" of units than your opponent.\n\nThe game is not very focused on decisionmaking or strategy. There's little sense of "outsmarting" your opponent as it is you're "outplaying" him by keeping up your production constantly, getting the upgrades at the right times and expanding at the right time. You're not setting traps or making elaborate plans. You're just building units and trying to keep your economy intact while doing it.\n\nSome units have special abilities but they are not the focal point of the gameplay.\n\nTL;DR: The singleplayer campaign is interesting. Skirmish and multiplayer is not very interesting.","January 29","true","35.7"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","3","4","0","1"

The gameplay is solid and the missions are varied.\n\n* The story elements lend themselves naturally to building up on origin story for Homeworld. Some people are incredibly over protective of the Homeworld story but this seems to build upon it nicely.\n\nCons:\n* It's far too short. I think this is an excellently made game but I cannot recommend you pick it up at full price because the campaign is over and done with far too quickly. The missions themselves are diverse but the actual tactical options are a bit limited (although not especially different to homeworlds tactics).\n\n* Homeworld succeeded because although you were often facing the same enemy you occasionally had missions with other races and bad guys getting involved (for whom the usual strategies wouldn't work) - unfortunately this game doesn't really break out into new and unexpected opponents.\n\nIn conclusion:\nIf you are a die hard fan of Homeworld then pick this up but expect to smash through the campaign in about four decent length play sessions. The lack of diversity in your opponents means that you don't really end up changing your tactics which is disappointing compared to previous Homeworld games. If you can wait then I suggest picking this game up at about half its launch price.\n","January 26","true","8.5"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

H:DK is a little joy of a game, with outstanding visuals, excellent optimisation... And FINALLY a gameplay that doesn't demand an LSD-Red bull mix worth of APM skills.\nIt's not exactly slow paced, but units don't die in two seconds, so you get time to adjust, control formations and positions, use what abilities there are (all straightforward and streamlined like speed boost for fast attack vehicles or smoke screens for tanks) as needed.\n\nDespite the apparent lack of variety in units (something I would personally object, as there are roughly 14 units per faction, there being two factions with subtle differences in their lineup), the gameplay has many layers, and the balance of resource gathering / unit construction-research / carrier usage (they're like the Motherships of old, only much more powerful) / artifact retrieval makes for a game where there is always something more to do, optimise or respond to.\n\nFinally, I grew up playing Homeworld 1. It was fantastic. This is its prequel, and from the audio design (guns, engines, UI, and especially the radio chatter), the music, the visuals, and the general narrative and atmosphere... I felt at home. It's more of a talented application of the meaning of this franchise onto a new game rather than fan service, and that means a great deal to me.\n\n10/10 would grow up playing.","January 25","true","30.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","1"

It follows the same ideas, but lacks real depth in terms of tactics. Straight forward game play with about half the game being resource managment and the other half being basic unit managment.

I felt there was a lack of units throughout the whole game, granted each unit has a specific role which it excells at, there wasnt much diversity.

I'd much rather have had a stand alone salvage-huge-spaceship-wrecks-game in the Homeworld universe, keeping some of the original mysterious atmosphere etc. More along the lines of what this seemed to be slated as when it was still Hardware: Shipbreakers.\n\nSecondly, it's waaaay too easy, even on the hardest difficulty. I had to stop myself from soaking up all the RU/CUs on the maps because it would simply have made it all even worse. Not to mention if you dare to farm some enemies in one of the missions with endless waves (most of them) to gain XP. Or capture a few enemy cruisers. Just don't do it, else you can pretty much just attack move every mission thereafter to completion.\n\n\nStill, regardless of those points you can't help but enjoy the time it takes to complete the campaign. It feels very reminiscent of Homeworld with some Ground Control thrown in. The S'jet focus takes away from it sometimes, but it still feels pretty grand and special while it lasts. The cut scenes are great for the most part, the action is non-stop, the tech upgrades and units keep on rolling out and the maps are mostly well-designed.\n\nAs for multiplayer in this one. Mjeeeh, not for me. If you're one to enjoy that aspect, I guess you'll get more hours out of it than me, and so might just get it at full price. Same if the mod scene takes off as that will no doubt add a lot of replay value.","January 28","true","23.1"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

You feel every loss and celebrate every enemy you turn into a flaming wreck.\n\nThe land based gameplay adds a refreshing layer of depth to the series, with physical obstacles being more of a consideration (IMHO) than the z-axis movement of the original games. Similarily, while the unit pool is perhaps a bit smaller, the option of having land or air based units gives players a bit more to consider when choosing a research and build path.\n\nLastly, the artifact retrieval mode rules.\n\nThe game has some minor setbacks, but nothing that wasn't present in the original games.","January 20","true","10.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

And I'm biased because I am also loyal to the brand. I've played Homeworld 1&2 when they first came out (they are in my nostalgia wishlist of things to get). The controls felt natural. The command playstyle was very Homeworld 1&2. It's a place where I was comfortable.\n\nIf you collect RTS this is one to add to your collection.

I completed the single player (distracted) in less than 8 hours. There aren't many ways to skin the cat (strategies that win the game) the story left me wanting more. I didn't feel challenged in the multiplayer and skirmish options. I've noticed that a lot from games recently, where they release a stable first product then pile on DLC's to increase the revenue.

Story is being told actively as you play the game, and the pace at which the game unfolds new features in the campaign allows the player to pick up what to do with different units very naturally. Story integrates itself well to the original Homeworld universe, and suble hints suggest that this conflict behind the Desert of Kharak campaign does not invole any clear "villain" or the "good-guy", but a society torn between progressivist and conservative at a time of hardship on a planet going through major climate change. If you require the story to be told in your face with everything blatantly obvious, you would probably not enjoy the story of Desert of Kharak. However, if you enjoy picking up subtle hints and plot pieces spread throughout the game's campaign, you'll enjoy playing through this game.\n\nAs for the aesthetics and presentation of the game, it inherits a lot of the visual and atomospher of the original Homeworld series. The designs are very minimal yet cleanly done, and if you were a fan of the original series (or a fan of the more realistic Scifi design), it'll most likely please you. Voice acting is also done in a natural manner instead of the over-the-top method you would find in lot of the other games. However, this is not without it's cons. Although the game put heavy emphasis on terrain utilization, it's sometimes difficult to visually decipher which grounds offer to terrain advantage until your units are physically interacting with the terrain. Since the difficulty level of the campaign is not too high this is not a major set back, but I wonder if this issue would be addressed in the future patch.\n\nOverall, the game offer a lot of promise, and I'm sure a lot of the kinks would be worked out in the near future. I highly recommend this game to the fans of the original Homeworld series as well as fans of RTS. Those who enjoyed games like Total Annihilation or Supreme Commander would definitely enjoy this game.","January 23","true","10.6"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

If you're not a homeworld fan(or looking to get into homeworld), and you're just looking for a good RTS then your mileage may vary based on what you have previously liked in the RTS genre.\n\nLong version:  Deserts of Kharak does well what every homeworld game has done before it - tell a story.  It's an exceedingly rare experience for an RTS to tell a story well, for you to care about what happens to the characters, for you to get emotionally invovled, and to be able to tell that story actively through the tiny units and voice-overs on the screen.\n\nGameplay is solid; each unit has a defined role that it excels in.  Exploiting unit's weaknesses and strengths is extremely satisfying when you're the one delivering, and appropraitely punshing if you're on the receiving end.  It's not so overpowered that you can simply overwhelm your oppoenent if they make a wrong move, but not so underpowered that it leaves you wondering if you actually have the upper hand.  Tactics (high ground, terrain blocking) and LOS make noticeable impact on gameplay as well, and this is a welcome addition.  It shakes up the standard rocks-paper-scissors gameplay enough to make every engagement interesting, and so that even a mismatched fight can be turned towards your favor.\nA side-note on gameplay; I've seen a lot of criticism of this game because it doesn't live up to standards set by games like starcraft.  I found this criticism generally unfair because the comparisions drawn I find unapplicable.  I think this game most resembles a cross between company of heroes and total annihiliation/ supreme commander.  Homeworld to Starcraft is like a BMW to a Ford.  They are both a car, they basically do the same thing, but that's about where the similarities end.  But I digress, moving on. . .\n\nAI and MP:  There's no nice way to put this but the AI is lacking in it's current state.  I played the campaign on the equivalent of medium, and at no point did I feel threatened or like I was going to lose.  MP is region locked which is stupid since there's a lobby system in place; it should have been simple to just add a ping and let players make their own decisions.  Also, there's only 5 maps to chose from when playing MP or skirmish.\nThese things are not a big deal to me (except the region lock), but that's probably because I played company of heroes competatively back in the day and there were only 5 maps I played on back then (1v1 automatch), and I only plan on playing Deserts competatively.  That being said, I still see these things as significant problems.  RTS's thrive on healthy skirmishs and a solid AI (or a solid competative community), and good maps help make both those things happen.\n\nBBI has said, as of the writing of this review, that they are working on the AI and they plan on releasing more maps.  They have also said that maps will always be free and never DLC.  They have not commented on the region lock to my knowlege.\n\nSo is it worth $50?  As I said at the beginning, your mileage will vary based on what you like in your RTS genre.  If you're looking for a RTS you can play by yourself and be entertained with for a long time (e.g. AoE, RoN), I would say not in its current state.  Give it a patch or two; see if the skirmish state improves.  If you're looking for a good story with potentially competative MP, then I would say yes.\n","January 24","true","18.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

Some points that I would change if i were Blackbird Interactive but any game that wants to keep the Homeworld legend going gets a thumbs up from me.\n\nPositives:\n\n- The story is really good. You really feel like you are working towards the survival of your people and you do get emotionally invested when you lose your units.\n- Graphics look great and run well on my ultra HD monitor in max settings\n- It is Homeworld! Even the unit icons look the same\n- Controls are relatively easy\n- Cutscenes are superb. The artistic effects are top notch.\n- Story follows the Homeworld storyline perfectly and I love the references to things you learnt in Homeworld 1 and 2.\n\nNegatives\n\n- Dont buy the expedition guide. There is so little information in there that it is definitely not worth buying. In fact I cannot understand how it comes to 600MB. Perhaps I am missing a huge part or I am going blind but £5~ is a lot of money for something that would cost a couple of pennies as a piece of paper.\n- Units could have a lot more variety. Hopefully they will patch in more at a later date.\n- This is based in the Homeworld universe but isn't Homeworld. I miss having multiple carriers creating a fleet of ships. In this you have one command ship that makes things and that is it.\n- Fleet sizes are a fraction of the size of in Homeworld the original. I remember making fleets of hundreds or thousands of ships (yes the lag was awful) and then fighting the enemy, In this game the fleets are only tens or at max a hundred.\n\nOverall\n\nIt's Homeworld so buy it. The more people that buy it, the more chance of Homeworld 3.","January 22","true","9.7"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

I mean how exciting can it be to fight in a desert? After playing 4 missions in the campaign I'm happy to say I'm pleased and hours went by without me realising it. The campaign keeps you on your toes and at least for me didn't allow me to camp too long and build my forces up to an overwhelming level. How you use light and heavy units becomes important as they all have strengths and weak points. Example: a pack of ranged railguns annhilated my swarm of light attack craft from high ground before they reached effective range. I'd like to see more maps for skirmish and multiplayer and hopefully some new units if possible. I loved homeworld and it's sequels and this ties in nicely as a prequel.

For fans of homeworld though, I would recommend this game. There are a few caveats, though.\n\n1. Controls are not rebindable.\n2. For a game that depends on terrain placement, one has to individually place each unit. With older homeworld games there was formation control, with this one, the controls are point and click. It's streamlined in a lot of ways, and this detracts from the overall experience.\n\nBut the major successes are that this game lives and breathes the homeworld universe. They essentially took every bit of lore from the 1999 manual to the cataclysm game, and fleshed it out completely.\n\nThe multiplayer maps are a bit thin at the moment, but they've promised that more maps are coming with future updates.\n\nLaunch Day bugs are very minor. Occasionally an enemy won't attack your position as expected. It's trivial to just go get them, or hit them with airstrikes.\n\nOverall, as someone who loves the homeworld universe, I loved this game.\n\nIf you like the homeworld universe, you'll love it too.\n\nYou'll be slightly disappointed that it lacks some of the features of previous games, but you'll still have fun.\n\nSo with a few caveats, I absolutely recommend this game, and hope for more and better from Gearbox in the future.","January 23","true","13.0"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","4","6","0","0"

This game was never meant to be an exact replica of 1 or 2 and I knew that they were trying a new form of play. The formula was not completely there unfortunately. I feel it lack some of the luster it should have had and feel that there should have been more in the way of ships and their design.

Game is not worth the current price tag,since there's nothing much to do in this game right now. When you've done with campaign,you'll proceed to multiplayer and you'll get bored by time,since there's only 5 maps. Game feels like early access,although developers are talking with us and they're saying,they're already working on updates.\nThe real elephant in the room is the lack of content. As of writing this there are only two factions, five official multiplayer maps, barely any AI to speak of, and a campaign that can be polished off easily in under ten hours. Nothing scandalous but it's definitely sparse for the price tag. Doubtless more content is on the way, and once it drops I'll happily flip my recommendation to a yes. Until then you'll have to decide whether fifty dollars is too much for a shiny, flimsy toy like DoK.\nIf you've played SC2 or Company of Heroes,than this game will feel really fresh.

After dejected in development hell for a good 6 years, the game is finally finished.  This new Homeworld game takes place nearly 100 years before the original.  In which a discovery of deviations in  Kharak, ensue an expedition through the southern deserts.\n\nThe Homeworld games are scientific, yet grungy.  And it is all used as a behind-the-scenes approach to help tell the story.  Religious warfare is a habituated trait among the dusts of Kharak.  And while an acreage of this plot was interlaced with the original Homeworld’s instruction manual.  Preconceived plot devices have been replaced in favor of concentrated design.  Squabbling races, somber sacrifices, and titanic discoveries all move the plot into a coherent stream, eventually creating a dynamic and unforgettable plot.\n\nThe animation and art-style are cel-shaded into an arenaceous aesthetic.  Vehicles look weathered and blemished.  And the physics are interlaced to the elevations of the deserts ridges.  Another description would be regarding the scale of your expedition through the secluse wild.  Units look impressive in scope when an abundance of them are present.  And the contrast from appliances, such as Salvagers when compared to the Kalisi, is well designed.The art-style perfectly conceives the atmosphere of the desert planet it’s trying to represent, with a great presence towards the desolation and emptiness of the Kharak landscape.  Seeing dune-buggy’s circle and bounce around their opposition is a satisfying use of physics, and the dust their wheels kick up is a wonderful example of the game’s attention to detail.  Overall this is a truly beautiful game, even on lower end computers.\n\nThe music in Deserts of Kharak is persistent in reminding you of the bleak pastels that you’re traversing.  Orchestrating and retaining the astrological concept of the original games, the soundtrack twists it into a symphony, chronicling an excursive crusade fully motivated by the desire to discover.  No longer are the airy drawls of the original homeworld, in it’s place are the searing sounds of low methodical beats.\n\nHomeworld: Deserts of Kharak is an RTS, a genre that has been seemingly dormant during recent years.  You can organize attack-squads, call in airstrikes, and control the hulking PC called the Kalisi, as you traverse the seemingly endless sand-dunes and opposing forces you encounter.  The micro-managing of resources and defense of incrusion, is an exercise in choices.  Should I allot development of better units, or should I create more of the same in order to fend off this attack?  Which resource should I harvest, and how many attack units should I leave with them in order to preserve them?  All of these questions contribute to how you will execute your gameplay experience when playing Deserts of Kharak.  It’s all very complicated, but intensely rewarding when you execute a perfect mission leaving no possibility unsecured in a timely manner.\n\nWith a 15 hour campaign, Deserts of Kharat includes a decently meaty story.  And including a multiplayer mode that has a bevy of replayability value, the value for Deserts of Kharat is impressive.  The game is a worthy successor that takes a step back in all the right places, while including an impressive amount of innovation and character that was not yet seen in the originals.  Gearbox, amidst their incredible resume, helped make a descendant to the cult-classic series, a choice that I hope they will continue to go through with.\n\nI was left wanting more by the end of Deserts of Kharak, not because of brevity, but because it was so satisfying to play.  Every second of the game was the perfect amount of difficulty that made me feeling hopeless one second, only to turn the mission around with one bold choice.  With a great world inhabited by great writing, Deserts of Kharak bares the Homeworld badge proudly.  The new perspective of ground combat is fresh and new, while the aesthetic and ambience increase an already quality RTS series worthiness.  Even if you are new to the series of Homeworld, and similarly unfamiliar with the RTS genre. Deserts of Kharak is a great game for veterans of the Homeworld series, and newcomers alike.\n\nHOMEWORLD: DESERTS OF KHARAK DESERVES A 9/10\nhttps://youtu.be/5vRjf-xsgxY\n","January 20","true","13.3"," 23 of 44 people (52%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","52","23","44","0","0"

I'll write my thoughts now and update the review as I go through the game. This is my initial impressions.\n\nGraphics, gameplay and performance\n\nAgain, graphically, the textures are of high detail for a RTS game and its a joy to zoom in and see the detail. Talking about the zoom, I like the tactical view, but, would love the ability to zoom out a little further, this game needs a supreme commander like tactical zoom. It can be tricky to navigate the battlefield when there is a lot going on.\n\nYou can customise the look of you fleet, for each battle, away from the default JCB yellow and in skirmish/multiplayer, play as either of the two factions, the Coalition or the Gaalsien. The Gaalsien have production carriers, allowing them to create units anywhere on the map, where as the carrier does this job for the Coalition, so they have managed ti create two gameplay styles here.\n\nI played this on my Core i5 4670 with GTX 970 and it looked amazing, frame rate a costant 60fps, lovely to look and and play with such a smooth frame rate. All settings were set to maximum. The minimum requirments suggest a GT 440, which is less than half the power of the GTX 860m in my 3ghz core i5 4210h laptop. Initially I got an appauling framerate in 1080p, and wondered what it would be like on one of the older cards! Dropping to 1600x900 or 1280x720 resolution, settings can be upped to medium and a respectable 20 - 25 fps can be acheived.\n\n**Update** I investigated further to see the cause of the low framerate and it was a combination of things.Firstly a recent Windows 10 "upgrade" had reset many of my settings to default, so the nvidia GPU was on auto select and the game had chosen the onboard intel gpu to run it! Forcing the 860m to again be default gave me 60fps at ultra. :)\n\nThe game seems stable and i've not experiences any crashing.\n\nSingle Player\n\nLovely cut scenes and graphices, love the audio and it really adds to the atmosphere of the game. I played on normal and found the game very balanced and fun to play. The AI didnt overwhelm you, but put up a good fight. Early on you are led through the first misson propper, after the initial training mission.\n\nSkirmish mode.\n\nOh dear, what happened here. I played this against and easy AI and it was impossible to get production off the ground, the AI relentlessly attacks from the off and you end up running out of resource collectoes before you have time to build any offensive units. Even when I did get some units, the AI player seemed to have overwhelming numbers very early on. The developers really need to fix this as the AI is stupidly hard to play against and skirmish mode is where the replay value is, co-op multiplayer vs the AI and so on.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nThe multiplayer is really good fun and when you introduce another player into the mix the AI responds diferently, is more cautious and doesnt bombard you with so many attacking units. Seems there are a fair number of people playing the game, so finding a multiplayer mach was relatively easy.\n\nGame modes are limited to Annialate everything, or just kill the carrier to win. You can turn artifacts on and off, these are kind of like capture the flag missions, get five to your extraction point and win the game.\n\nI'm not the best games player, so was easily beaten, but as i'm relatively new to this game I'm sure i'll get better.\n\nOverall, I'm enjoying the single player. Its just a shame about the low end perfomance at 1080p espically, and the insanly hard AI in skirmish mode on 1v1. I hope in the future there will be more in the way of units added, whether through dlc or free updates, as what you have on offer is limited.\n\nI paid 23.99 for the game and think it was money well spent. I'll do a final update when i've completed the campaign, so far I've found it very absorbing. The game reminds me very much of the origional homeworld games, and has a great look and feel to it\n\nI'll give the game a thumbs up for now, but will update the review as I go through the campeign :)","January 20","true","17.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

They actually tried to flesh out the characters in this, which seems weird, you feel some connection to them, but they are relatively flat.\n\nCombat is interesting, though aligning your troops on a ridge is damn near impossible. Aircraft offers a good long range strike capability which is OP, unless they have some AA defenses, but still they can also be knocked out using aircraft. Despite the aircraft dominating land vehicles still are effective for holding ground so you can better position your aircraft.\n\nThe little things are sadly underdone: docking, formations, tactics all seem to be gone which is saddening.\n\nOverall I recommend because it is relentlessly capturing, I could not put in down.","January 20","true","10.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I'll write my thoughts now and update the review as I go through the game. This is my initial impressions.\n\nGraphics, gameplay and performance\n\nAgain, graphically, the textures are of high detail for a RTS game and its a joy to zoom in and see the detail. Talking about the zoom, I like the tactical view, but, would love the ability to zoom out a little further, this game needs a supreme commander like tactical zoom. It can be tricky to navigate the battlefield when there is a lot going on.\n\nYou can customise the look of you fleet, for each battle, away from the default JCB yellow and in skirmish/multiplayer, play as either of the two factions, the Coalition or the Gaalsien. The Gaalsien have production carriers, allowing them to create units anywhere on the map, where as the carrier does this job for the Coalition, so they have managed ti create two gameplay styles here.\n\nI played this on my Core i5 4670 with GTX 970 and it looked amazing, frame rate a costant 60fps, lovely to look and and play with such a smooth frame rate. All settings were set to maximum. The minimum requirments suggest a GT 440, which is less than half the power of the GTX 860m in my 3ghz core i5 4210h laptop. Initially I got an appauling framerate in 1080p, and wondered what it would be like on one of the older cards! Dropping to 1600x900 or 1280x720 resolution, settings can be upped to medium and a respectable 20 - 25 fps can be acheived.\n\n**Update** I investigated further to see the cause of the low framerate and it was a combination of things.Firstly a recent Windows 10 "upgrade" had reset many of my settings to default, so the nvidia GPU was on auto select and the game had chosen the onboard intel gpu to run it! Forcing the 860m to again be default gave me 60fps at ultra. :)\n\nThe game seems stable and i've not experiences any crashing.\n\nSingle Player\n\nLovely cut scenes and graphices, love the audio and it really adds to the atmosphere of the game. I played on normal and found the game very balanced and fun to play. The AI didnt overwhelm you, but put up a good fight. Early on you are led through the first misson propper, after the initial training mission.\n\nSkirmish mode.\n\nOh dear, what happened here. I played this against and easy AI and it was impossible to get production off the ground, the AI relentlessly attacks from the off and you end up running out of resource collectoes before you have time to build any offensive units. Even when I did get some units, the AI player seemed to have overwhelming numbers very early on. The developers really need to fix this as the AI is stupidly hard to play against and skirmish mode is where the replay value is, co-op multiplayer vs the AI and so on.\n\nMultiplayer\n\nThe multiplayer is really good fun and when you introduce another player into the mix the AI responds diferently, is more cautious and doesnt bombard you with so many attacking units. Seems there are a fair number of people playing the game, so finding a multiplayer mach was relatively easy.\n\nGame modes are limited to Annialate everything, or just kill the carrier to win. You can turn artifacts on and off, these are kind of like capture the flag missions, get five to your extraction point and win the game.\n\nI'm not the best games player, so was easily beaten, but as i'm relatively new to this game I'm sure i'll get better.\n\nOverall, I'm enjoying the single player. Its just a shame about the low end perfomance at 1080p espically, and the insanly hard AI in skirmish mode on 1v1. I hope in the future there will be more in the way of units added, whether through dlc or free updates, as what you have on offer is limited.\n\nI paid 23.99 for the game and think it was money well spent. I'll do a final update when i've completed the campaign, so far I've found it very absorbing. The game reminds me very much of the origional homeworld games, and has a great look and feel to it\n\nI'll give the game a thumbs up for now, but will update the review as I go through the campeign :)","January 20","true","17.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","1"

The story is well written and executed, it is mostly fed to you through cutscenes and animatics. Even for fans of the original titles (who kinda know how the game is going to end, after all it`s a prequel) there are plenty of surprises!\n\nMultiplayer/Skirmish is fun but it suffers a bit from the low map choice (5 maps at release). At least in "Artifact Retrieval" mode (basically capture the flag) the AI can be very, very challenging actually, I can not confirm the experience of some reviewers here. Note that keys can not be rebound at the moment, though the standard layout of the quickbuttons is okay and usable.\n\nPerformance was good on an i3 and a GTX 650 Ti, FPS did only drop in very, very, very intense situations (lots of units and boom). No major bugs encountered, except for an UI bug that caused returning from the options menu to be quite a wait (30 secs+). Only ever had a single crash so far, this occured right before loading a new mission.\n\nAlthough the title obviously still needs some work I am satisfied with this purchase and excited for upcoming new content (free maps have already been promised, further DLC are "in the pipe").\n\n8/10 would recommend","January 21","true","60.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I guess that will come with time, the game came out 10 hours ago ^^ but again, not an early access or a beta so i hope it happens fast. The building system is a bit weird, needs some getting used to. You're almost always on edge with ressources, which requires you to move your base almost all the time.

Not tried Multiplayer yet or the Classic Campaign, may update review later if I try them. I played the Remastered Collection to completion and know the storyline of Cataclysm.\n\nPros:Fantastic visual design and art. Cutscenes are beautiful, artwork is beautiful, maps are usually beautiful, but occassionally not to the same standards of Sup Com 2 and similar titles.\n\nMusic is as good as the originals I'd say, definitely the same feel.\n\nA few nice gameplay mechanics - such as acquiring new resources and artifacts from destroying wreck bulkheads, Carrier power systems, etc.Meh:Unit design is nice far out, kinda flat when zoomed in. This is an RTS though, you get most of the pretty factor focused away from the very expendable, very numerous units. Unit combat has a few visual bugs such as firing angles being messed up, and units hit by heavy weaponry sometimes do somersaults. Aircraft that are shot down will bounce as though they are made of rubber sometimes, but look very cool at least.\n\nCouple of frame freezes in big battles but game ran smoothly for the most part.\nCons:Story is a bit barebones. I know Homeworld is very much about saying a lot with very little, but it seems like they only managed the very little part here; it comes close to capturing the feel of the story but misses the mark a bit. There's quite a few points where something is mentioned and never expanded on too. I think I might need to access that Expedition Guide DLC and see if it has the missing pieces there, but it feels like a lot of the additional lore and background for this game is simply not present. I'm also not really satifised with many of the wrecks present in the game; a couple of them especially feel like retconns, well, nearly all of them are iirc besides the Khar-Toba. A couple in particular are very questionable additions in my view though, and the ending itself was a little underwhelming. There's little characterisation in the game and little exposition.\n\nCombat is very Rock, Paper, Scissors. A lot of the time it boils down to "Does the Enemy have AA?". If not, use air. If yes, use a Cruise Missile and ask the question again. If still yes, then send in the ground troops; otherwise, you'll be spending more money rebuilding troops than you spend on Cruise Missiles blowing everything to kingdom come. On Normal difficulty, I spent the majority of the game sitting on a surplus of least 40K CU and 4K RU, patiently waiting for a challenge to come that'd need me to rebuild. It never did, because Cruise Missile <-> Air ---> Ground Troops is the solution to everything.\n\nEnemy AI is braindead. The Enemy will never react to your actions smartly, if you use air often, it'll never build more AA than it otherwise is preordained to. This makes air the solution to every problem in Skirmish mode, and most of your problems in the Campaign too. In Campaign, it'll send cookie cutter attack waves that are easily predictable due to how sensors work and the complete lack of stealth mechanics. Normally they can be dealt with by air, sometimes you'll want a Cruise Missile instead. Sometimes you'll just bludgeon them to death with a souped up combat powered Carrier. The enemy never seems to use abilities, and difficulty is more of a setting of 'How much shall the AI cheat?' with regards to their resource collection. The Enemy will rarely retreat, if ever, even under overwhelming fire or fire it cannot fire back upon. It will either sit there and die or chase you blindly and die.\n\nUnit AI is a bit off at times. Nothing co-ordinates their attacks intelligently, such as splitting their fire if they know they will kill the enemy in a single attack. This leads to entire airstrikes being wasted on a single light attack vehicle when a cluster of assault vehicles are behind it, and artillery fire being massed on singlular points rather than covering an entire wave. So you are forced to micromanage your artillery and air, to prevent your most powerful assets being wasted on the weakest units. Everything aims for overkill, and everything targets the first thing in sight, not the most dangerous or most relevant to their preferred target class.\n\nControls are strange and un-rebindable.\n\nThe 3D aspect of the game doesn't see much facetime due to the skewed balance towards air. No high ground is higher than the sky. But besides that, a lot of the time it requires finicky micromanagement to make proper use of it due to the lack of a Company of Heroes style click and drag movement control. Trying to organise units into a formation facing in one way in this game is a nightmare. Formations in general in this game are nightmarish to manage, the default unit layout is abysmal and will lead only to defeat and despair.\n\nNo targetable subsystems on larger vehicles or the Carrier itself, nor much unit variety beyond some simplistic balance where basically smaller direct combat unit is the counter to bigger indirect combat unit (if it survives long enough to reach it) which is counter to similar sized direct combat unit which is the counter to smaller sized direct combat unit. I.E. LAVs > Railguns > AAVs > LAVs and their cruiser cousins appear to follow the same pattern but ground combat is unneccessary against the AI by that point as you have air units. Abilities are generally uninteresting beyond the AAV smokescreen which is actually both useful and interesting. There are no units comparable to Destroyers or Dreadnoughts though. Just fighters, corvettes and frigates really.Conclusion:\nThe game feels rushed. It feels like the purely multiplayer title (no computer AIs iirc) Hardware: Shipbreakers was instead rapidly transformed into a singleplayer game that wanted to be a Homeworld prequel, but didn't have the time or resources left to flesh out the story or build a worthwhile computer AI. As a result, we have neither the very promising Hardware: Shipbreakers, nor do we have the fully realised Homeworld prequel that either Gearbox or Blackbird ended up pushing for. What we have is a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ child of the two, a Homeworld story set in the Hardware: Shipbreakers game with plenty of crossed circuitry and not much of it functional.\n\n\nIt comes very close to being a brilliant game, but the AI is woeful to the point of inexcusable, and the story did not satisfy me, hopefully the Expedition Guide changes that but I doubt it. Combat becomes quite boring once you figure out that Air is supreme, and unlock the Cruise Missile.\n\nTo end with, I recommend this game if it is on sale for anything around 50% off - £15 or less. It feels like a half-baked standalone expansion pack, not a AAA RTS title. I'm dissappointed, and hope they can fix the AI issues soon so that Blackbird does not suffer too much for this muckup.\n\nExpedition Guide Update\nI've read most of the Expedition Guide now, it contains most of the setting and background I felt was missing from the Campaign itself, and contains hints towards either possible expansions/sequels, or ideas that were not realised in time to be implemented in this game. However, it does not make up for the Story itself in my eyes, nor does it negate the issues with combat in this game at all.","January 21","false","15.9"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","8","15","0","0"

Just small engagements where your air units and tanks with support cruiser does the job.

The graphics are really great and give a whole atmosphere to the game, and finally get to learn that city that was seen in the original homeworld cutscene. The audio is really good, the sountrack is top notch and the battles are really something, compared to a few reviews i have read up about the durability of units and the lack of, there are some units that have lasted to the last mission from the first mission and there are other units that can take on a fair sized force by themselves with a support cruiser running back up for healing and defense.\n\nThe cons unfortunately are unit movements, in that when you click attack with a group of units, some of them do not respond on the first second or third attempt, they fire at the target if it's in range but they fail to move. You have to manually move them and then attack the target to get them to move.\n\nMinor sound breaking specifically when you got a number of units parked against a rock, it can actually impact the performance by reducing frame rate as well, even with v-sync on there are some signs of tearing (everything on full and max and i have the rated computer for max settings without issue).\n\nThe final battle with the main enemy "mothership" if you like, this unit moves in such a strange way that it makes for long range bombardment hard to do. For example i was going to launch a cruise missile at the target and suddenly the target veered right sideways? I have also seen it move in reverse to the right and it had no angle to do that.\n\nI have yet to play multiplayer but early signs are positive.\n\nEdit: i have discovered the game is region locked, meaning world wide multiplayer is not possible, so for example, if you are in europe, you can only play european players. there is a way around it however which is the switch your region download to another location, but keep in mind you are switching from one region to another. with that stated, the multiplayer part of the game could degenerate quickly due to a varied lack of players from across the planet to play against.","January 21","true","21.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The music, art, unit design, UI all give the game that distinctive Homeworld look. Controlling units is a breeze and the UI is very clean and not very cluttered. Camera controls are also very smooth. There is a decent variety of units and you need to use most units effectively to achieve victory. There is no single massively over-powered unit that you can just build and win the game. Elevation and line of sight are done very well and are very important to winning each battle with minimal casualties. I found the story (a prequel to original Homeworld) to be a pretty good one, although anyone who has played the original Homeworld will know the story already. Although the entire game is set in a desert I loved it anyway because of how beautiful the game looks and there are still different desert types. It really made me think of Dune and how awesome it would be if Dune was remade using a modern engine.\n\nThe bad: the campaign is short, it took me about 8 hours to get to the last mission and there is no replayability value in the single-player campaign. It's not like Starcraft 2 campaigns with some branchine choices and big diversity of units. The voice acting in the campaign is not stellar and I didn't care much about the characters (heck, I don't think I can remember more than two or three names of in-game characters). The AI is terrible, it's not much of a challenge even on hard and it cheats aggressively to offer even this meager challenge. The scirmish mode is fun but it needs more than just 5 maps and two different game types (destroy the carrier and artifact hunt). Furthermore, there are only two factions and although their tech trees and units are slightly different, they don't really have that big a difference in play styles and tactics. There is a bit of color customization but otherwise you can't customize the look of your units.\n\nBottom line: this is a good RTS with a lot of potential, but at the moment there just isn't enough content in the game to warrant the price. I liked it a lot but I would recommend waiting until it's on sale.","January 26","true","10.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

While you can find it strange, I will try to explain why.\n\nI like this military drama story. Aside from that, I like how BBI used the Homeworld lore and added stuff to it. After a series of my recent disappointments like HotS (what they did to Kerrigan is abysmal if we take Brood Wars into account) and SW7 it is such a pleasure to watch the coherence with HW1&2 story.\n\nScenery is not as diverse as I wanted but it is okay for a desert planet. Unit design is sometimes cubic but I have no problem since it looks organic and intended: we have a really advanced and exotic race focused on hid and run tactics and slow but sure utilitarian design race. Which leads you to gameplay which is insanely addictive, watching the battlefield from a close distance can consume me for hours, excellent soundtrack adds to it and multiplayer... It is insane how many tactics you can use and how many builds you can choose since both races similar but plays different. Balance needs some tweaks but the core looks very promising now. The only thing I want to complain about is spawned enemy forces in campaign on higher difficulty, looks a bit cheap but who cares? It just intensifies the campaign :)\n\nIt has small bugs but nothing game breaking and almost all titles have them these days so I am used to it.\n\nIf you want a clone of Starcraft or Supreme Commander then this game is definitely not for you.

It provides you with great and accurate information and gives you nice quick control over it. Mixed with the voice overs in the campaign the whole experience really did give me a commander feel. Over looking the battle.\nTerrain plays a big part of combat so I find myself pausing at the start of mission just to have a quick look round the battlefield for areas of higher terrain. Theres 3 terrain types low, medium and high. Any unit on a higher terrain will recieve a bonus over those on a lower terrain. Mix this with unit strengths such as the LAV being better against railgun units and you can really turn a few units into a dangerous force.\nCombat looks great in the game LAV's being probably the most fun to witness as they circle and swurve there way around each other and the enemy gunning down anything near them.\nThe desert environment looks stunning and when you see a group of units moving with a cloud of dust behind them it gives a great atmosphere to the game.\nSo far though I haven't been able to play it anywhere near as much as it deserves I would highly recommend checking this game out. It performs well even on my not so great system and it plays beautiful.

Be warned though performance is lower than expected from such a game.\n\nThe sound design, a known high point of the series also does not disappoint. Not only are the tunes perfectly in sinc with the action and visuals, but the constant unitchatter prowides an undeniable sense of presence. And I haven't heard a piece of repeated dialog for three hours into the game.\n\nMechanically, this is a competent RTS. It brings no great innovation, but what it does it does well. The small number of units may initially seem a drawback, but I've never found myself looking for any functionality that wasn't present in some way. Pathing appears good, and units respond well to orders. The game is set on a series of hard-counters, andthey are mercylessly enforced. So if that's not your thing stay away from it.\n\nThe multiplayer I didn't explore much, so I can't provide criticism.\n\nTL.DR.:\n\nHomeworld: Deserts of Kharak is a game true to it's predecessors. Stunning visuals and superb sound-design support a competent but non-innovative story driven RTS with prominent hard-counter mechanics.","January 20","true","20.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I chose normal difficulty on my first playthrough, and never even came close to losing a mission. On my second playthrough, I chose the harder 'classic' difficulty, and only lost once, (Due to my own stupidity, not the difficulty of the mission).\n\nThe storyline is nice, although the campaign feels quite short, and ends on a rather dull note, in my opinion at least. And from the outset, you are told the objective in the desert will lead to the salvation of the Kushun people, but why? How do they know this? Just seems like strange dialogue to have so early in the game when they aren't even sure what they are going to find out there in the desert.\n\nI found the campaign to be nicely immersive however, and it seems a lot of thought and development has gone into the technology and engineering of the units, for how a civilization living on a desert planet would design their vehicles and such.\n\nThe camera is somewhat annoying as well, much of the time I found it very claustrophobic outside of the sensors manager (The blue map you get when you hit spacebar), and there isn't a lot of range to zoom in and out, it is capped at a very low altitude. Unit selection is kind of a pain too, there is no military-priority selection, so dragging a big box around everything is only going to select everything.\n\nPathfinding AI is quite bad too, on my second playthrough I tried building a lot of cruisers to form a carrier battlegroup, but most of them wouldn't follow my carrier properly, and would sit still trying to engage an enemy unit that wasn't within their line of sight.\n\nThere are no formation controls as far as I can see, and no proper positioning for units in formations, when told to guard/escort your carrier, all the utility units place themselves on the outside of the formation (where they will get killed by the first unit that attacks you), instead of hugging close to the carrier like you would expect.\n\nThere isn't a lot of content either, I seem to remember there being a much bigger variety of units in the other HW games, in this game you have;\nA resource collector\nLight attack vehicle (Scissors)\nArmoured Assault Vehicle (Rock)\nRailgun (Paper)\nBaserunner (minelayer)\n4 x kinds of cruisers\nA fighter\nA bomber\n\nThat is it, so overall it is a very simple game, there aren't different kinds of frigates or corvettes like we had in the other games. But this is partially compensated for by your carrier (mothership) which can shunt power and be used offensively, defensively, or as a support ship.\n\nThere are only 5 multiplayer maps too, which is a shame because it could really use the variety. I am presuming they will bring out more DLC to rectify this (Which we will have to pay for).\n\nBut overall, I am happy with my purchase, if you like homeworld, you will probably like this. If you aren't familiar with homeworld, I would probably just stick with the remastered collection, at least acquiant yourself with it before buying this one, because the story of this game really depends on your knowledge of the other games.\n","January 25","true","32.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

Apparently, the way to revive an old, beloved franchise is to stick close to the originals' plot, sometimes lifting stuff beat-for-beat, and to focus mainly on recapturing the atmosphere. DoK is engineered to make players draw parallels to Homeworld: it has a somber mood, slow pacing, a lone mothership and its crew, a long, harrowing journey over enemy territory, a desperate quest that will make or break an entire civilization, ominous mystical overtones, a fantastic middle-eastern soundtrack, units and resources carrying over from previous missions, rock-paper-scissors balancing that makes units useless most of the time and completely overpowered when used against the right targets at the right distance with the right support, etc. etc.\n\nIt also has enough new stuff (elevation, air units, carrier upgrades and power-shunting) to not qualify as a retread, which is more than can be said of Homeworld 2 and Cataclysm. Honestly, as much as the desert setting is getting flack, I don't think a fourth Homeworld game set in space with the same old units would really have energized the franchise. And I'm happy we're getting a window into Kharakid society again, since Homeworld 1 had that wonderful Historical and Technical Briefing booklet that greatly expanded the lore of Kharak and its various kiithid... and then did away with the planet and its people in the first few minutes of the campaign.","January 24","true","13.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The journey took me 12 hours of gameplay at this point. I loved the ambient music of the game, and am seriously considering buying the soundtrack. Now, to put it simply here are my views.\n\nPros:\nExtremely thematic music.\nIt's a desert, but they keep the terrain interesting.\nEach unit has its uses, and they keep the number small enough that you don't wonder why they put units in.\nI've always loved persistent fleets, and the veterancy makes it even better.\nExcellent story, and quite good voice-acting as well.\nThe power shunt system for your carrier is amazing.\n\nCons:\nIt was too easy to beat on the main difficulty. Your best bet is to get as many resources as you can to build a fleet, and then alpha-strike the main objective in a single massive attack to finish things. Otherwise you just get killed by the death of a thousand cuts due to your opponent not needing resources to produce vehicles.\nThe AI is less than stellar, but makes up for it due to campaign scripting.\nLeaves lots of questions unanswered. Admittedly, primarily because they were answered in the other Homeworld games, but still.\nSkirmish maps are lacking in number.\n\nOverall:\nI recommend the game to Homeworld enthusiasts. I recommend others wait for it to go on sale.

If you bought the remaster on the steam sale you automatically get 20% off this game so that's an equivalent deal.\n\nGame runs decently well, even on ultra settings (i5/970) but in MP you probably want to play at lower settings for FPS. I like how you can press ALT to toggle sensor range / fog of war area, just try it because I'm not great at explaining it.\n\nSo far so good except that when you play the campaign the cutscenes are unskippable which is annoying. MP modes seem fun, some folks at the Homeworld discord are streaming their MP matches now (release day afternoon).\n\nThe most annoying things about playing the campaign right now are:\n- Can't pause to issue commands (hard to coordinate multi-pronged tactics, but I guess that's like playnig a MP game)\n- no labels for control groups\n- unskippable cinematics (unlike in the old homeworld games)\n\nI'll update when I play some more campaign and MP matches.","January 20","true","19.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","2","4","0","0"

However, it is not quite there yet. With a nearly broken MP functionality and balancing issues it's proven to be challenging to like this game as much as I want to. It has all the attributes of a Homeworld title yet it seems obvious the game needed more gameplay tweaks and balancing done before release, it feels rushed.\n\n- In MP the Coalition player is currently unable to research a bigger fleet meaning playing that faction is not an option until the (glaringly obvious) issue is addressed in a patch.\n- The main campaign feels too scripted, the player is left with little tactical options as there is no time nor room for it and as far as strategy goes it comes down to two things only, aquiring resources and meeting mission goals and that's it. So one is left with the impression that there is only one way to successfully play through the campaign.\n- The pace of the game is hectic and on par with your typical RTS style game of today, maybe a little faster even, which is not what the Homeworld franchise became known for. Forget spending time building up a fleet and plan your attack, there is no time, and either you have Cruisers or you don't. Once you have lost the heavies they tend to be gone for the rest of the game since the resources simply aren't available to replace them. Which leaves you with one remaining option, to use your Carrier as a battlewagon. You can get away with that, until later in the game and then you'll need to start over.\n\nI do recommend the game, simply because of the undeniable potential which is there. Yet if you don't intend to get frustrated playing through a unfinished campaign and waiting for the patching needed then there's not much to it, wait for the update. Forget MP until the fleet issue is fixed and more maps are made available.","January 24","true","30.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

There's definitely some bad to it, but it's very solid. 8/10\n\nI am a long time RTS player and as far as game mechanics go, this game is in my top 5.\nVisually/atmospherically: This game is number 1. The music, the art, the effects, the feel, all of it are amazing.\n\nCurrently, the game loses a point for the multiplayer having too few maps. There are 13 story missions and I don't see how they couldn't reuse or rework story mission maps into skirmish maps. Perhaps that will happen later. Or even better, we will get player made ones.\n\nThe game also loses a point for some of the vehicle balance. LAV's are worthless. There is no point in having them except maybe as cannon fodder. You can run around with 4-5 AAV's, 4-5Rail guns, and 3-4 Missile AAV's and never get touched with a support cruiser in tow.\n\nAll in all, if this is what I can expect from BBI, I hope they continue the homeworld franchise.

A beautiful re-imagining of the original games, modernized similar to the HD re-releases Gearbox put out earlier this year.  From its unique art style, rousing music, to its masterful balance of your typical rock paper scissor mechanics found in most RTS games, its about as polished and well made as any RTS game released in the last decade.\n\nThe story, while a bit light, which is usual for games in this genre, still manages to hit the right notes and provide some great Sci Fi story telling.  It provides a thrilling backstory to the Homeworld universe, with unique a varied mission objectives.  I didn't mind the desert environments, each map feeling hand crafted.\n\nIf I had any complaints, it was the length of the campaign.  Similar to the previous homeworlds, it only had 13 missions in total.  There were several late game units that I didn't feel I had time to learn how to use, or bring to bare in an exciting way against my enemies.  Aircraft can also feel like an "I win" button for several early mission, but are balanced later in the game when anti air vehicles become more prevalent.\n\nThe land carrier, which takes the place of the mother-ship from previous games, feels a bit too strong.  I did enjoy the overhead mechanics which had me switching between systems, but with a few repair vehicles near by I never felt it was at threat.\n\nOver all, one of the best RTS games I've played in years.  More grand strategy, then your typical Star Craft twitch / micromanagement play style.\n\nI'm really hoping they continue the Homeworld series.","January 24","true","11.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The story is really interesting.  For all you Homeworld fans, it gives you all sorts of background info on the Unification of Kharak and the discovery of the Core.  The story is mostly told through personal diary logs,  in-game video cuts and simple artistic cut scenes.  It's all good stuff and it all adds to the sense of loneliness and desperation Homeworld fans would be familiar with.  For non-Homeworld fans, you're not really missing anything from not having played those games.  You'll get right into it and know what's going on.\n\nThe game also looks great.  There's not a ton of color or detail in the maps, but that was likely intentional to a degree so that the devs could convey the vastness and emptiness of the Desert.  The units, however, look great, as do their weapon particles and physics.  Watching your units traverse the sands (bobbing up and down as you hit bumps, cresting dunes and sliding down) makes it obvious how much effort Gearbox put into this type of immersion.\n\nGetting into the gameplay itself, first impressions are really good.  Units are responsive, there's a lot of rock-paper-scissors going on and the units move fast enough and the weapons are powerful enough that you really have a lot to keep track of and do.  The battles themselves are exciting to watch too.  Units swarm around each other, artillery barrages throw up huge clouds of dust, and weapons all make satisfying BOOMS and impacts.  I had a great time playing the campaign and even on Normal difficulty there were quite a few tense moments.  I BARELY won the final mission, with my carrier within 10% health on a last ditch all-in attack to finish the objective.\n\nWhere I think this game lacked for me is in content.  Ultimately, I don't think there's enough there to justify the price tag.  The campaign was way too short.  I finished it in about 8-10 hours and while it was good, I expected it to be a lot longer.  This was disappointing.\n\nAdditionally, I don't see a large multiplayer community thriving around the game either.  I'd love if that weren't the case, but there doesn't seem to be enough content, unit variety or balance to encourage anything long term.  There's a TINY number of multiplayer maps and they're fairly small.  Like Homeworld, skirmishing and resource harrassment are a huge part of how the game plays out.  Unlike Homeworld, however, full scale engagements don't last very long.  Airstikes and artillery can make short work of large numbers of units and it really throws off the pacing of the game.  This might be addressed in balancing but personally it felt to me like the game, while polished and fun, was trimmed down more than it should be in terms of features and variety.\n\nHonestly, I enjoyed it.  I don't regret buying it but at the same time I'm not thrilled with the purchase.  It's likely to be another game that entertained me briefly but that I'll ultimately forget about.\n\n","January 24","true","10.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The "aggressive, neutral and defensive" behaviors are really lacking. They aren't any formations for your fleets either : those damn support cruiser will often walk over your lines of tanks and it looks ridiculous, and the cruiser exposes itself to enemy fire on the top of that.

As it stands right now, my answer would be only if you were a fan of RTS games. Keep in mind, I am new to Homeworld. I have the Remastered collection, but have less than an hour or two in it. Got it on sale and have barely touched it. Think that hols true for many of us on many games.\n\nHere is why I wish for a middle ground for reviews. In the last few missions, it got to be somewhat easy, even against the "overwhelming" enemy AI. I just spammed air units and cruise missiles and such while keeping my core forces around the Kapisi and my salvage crews.  I played the game on Medium (two stars) difficulty. Then again, I have had somewhat extensive experience playing RTS games in the past and have greatly enjoyed doing so myself.\n\nThen again, I did greatly enjoy the missions and it did eventually present a challenge, even if is was only when the friendly AI derped and Rachel was left hanging instead of following the main force around. I enjoyed the concept of the upgradeable and mobile base and units. The UI was refreshingly simple and easy. Use the carrier for production and research. You have deployable repair/collection units. The rest of your units are combat/combat support types.

So when Homeworld remastered got released last year, I spent a huge amount of time working my way through the missions and the skirmish mode.\nWhen I found out that Shipbreakers wasn't far off I took the decision to stop playing and move onto something else , and a day after it was released as Deserts of Kharak I have already completed the games campaign in the easy mode.\n\nSo what does this game have to offer?\nIf you are a fan of the RTS games like C&C or Supreme Commander then this is a must for you, even if you didnt like the original homeworld games.\nThe ground orientated combat is merged seemlessly with homeworlds ambiance and storytelling as you guide an expidition though the war torn banded desert on the hunt for an artifact that will save your race.\n\nYup - you guessed it if you didnt already know, this is a prequel and you ultimatley find the Khar-Toba, which would lead onto the Guidestone, and onto Homeworld 1...\n\nWhat doesnt this game have?\nWell, I'd like to say a long story, its only 13 missions long which was a bit of a disapointment, i would have liked to have played a bit longer.\nAlso the game seems to end each mission very quickly not allowing you to harvest the local resources and find artifacts that remain. Surely a mission like this, that would be a key focus. Similar to homeworld 1.\nAlso there are only a handful of skirmish maps, so I am hoping the developers release some FREE DLC soon with added maps, maybe some of the missions converted into skirmish maps as each mission map was excellently crafted.\n\nAll-in-all this for homeworld fans and other RTS fans alike, this game is a must.\nBut remember if like me you have an older system to turn the graphics down before you launch into the campaign as its difficult to change the settings unless if you use the main menu options pannel. There is one mission in particular that is a graphics hog.\n\nSo why did i metion that I stopped playing the remastered games?\nI had a feeling that the last scene in the last mission would get me wanting to play the other games again.\nAnd I wasnt dissapointed when I heard something familiar in the last cutscene. Im looking forward to playing homeworld 1 again after this. And I hope we see more new homeworld coming soon!","January 21","true","21.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Until the end where it stops far far too short? If you aren't into Homeworld you are going to struggle with the plot imho because the ending isn't explained well at all almost as if they didn't want to fully cross over into HW1 territory just yet.\n\n- Had a go at MP with a friend and soon discovered an OP early game strategy which basically blows MP out the water for now.\n\nIn summary then the basic game is there and is solid but to me it feels like I'm playing 1/2 a game (and suspect the 2nd half is on its way in 1yr time). Its almost like Gearbox is testing the market to see if "Homeworld 2016" can work and opted for a shortened/summarised version.\n\nWould I recommend it? Yes I would, I wouldn't call it 9/10 material though it clearly had the potential if it was allowed to mature. Overall BBI did a good job and really their fault is in not releasing what I would call a complete and well-rounded game but what they have done they have done well. To draw an analogy a little like Elite Dangerous where what was done was good but there needs to be more for it to work properly for the player/User Experience.","January 26","true","21.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Just the sight of your fleet moving through desert at night can give you an aesthetic enjoyment.\n- Sound effects, music and units voice overs are 10/10.\n- On highest setting game looks very good and runs smooth on my 2014's hardware.\n- Quite balanced and fun gameplay in the best traditions of Homeworld series. There are two faction which looks similar to each other at first, but they have different strategies and tactics to dominate the desert battlefield. This reminds me Hiigarans and Vaygr from Homeworld 2, though the Coalition and Gaalsiens have even more differences.\n\nCons:\n\n- Just a five maps for skirmish and multiplayer. Developers already promissed more as free updates.\n- Very few option settings for skirmish and MP\n- Limping Gaalsien AI in skirmish. The Coalition one is much more aggressive even on easy, but still suffers from lack of "cunning" and variety of tactics.\n- There is no way to change hotkeys for now.\n\nDespite its minor and temporal flaws I can recommend this game to anyone who is looking for good singleplayer experience in RTS. Multiplayer is somewhat lacking for now, but I'm sure things will be fixed quite soon and more content will be added.","January 24","true","25.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

However the game is solid, didn't show any performance issue nor major bugs (only noticed 2 fairly minor).\nIt's also enjoyable and a pleasure to look at. The gameplay is accessible even for non-hardcore RTS players, so don't be put off.\n\nThe campaign is short, but like in Homeworld 1, the story sells it. If you are an RTS fanatic it's probably going to be a little flat/easy, but it's an enjoyable game nonetheless. I recommend playing in "Classic" mode from the get go, because playing conservatively (something you should have learned if you played HW1!), even Normal isn't that challenging (though it has moments that get your blood pumping).\n\nThe music is awesome (same composer as HW1 soundtrack) and the graphics / art, are gorgeous.\n\nIf this hasn't convinced you yet then wait for a discount and buy it anyway because the game is worth it and the game developer has shown good potential, that should be encouraged.","January 24","true","13.0"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

The story is really interesting.  For all you Homeworld fans, it gives you all sorts of background info on the Unification of Kharak and the discovery of the Core.  The story is mostly told through personal diary logs,  in-game video cuts and simple artistic cut scenes.  It's all good stuff and it all adds to the sense of loneliness and desperation Homeworld fans would be familiar with.  For non-Homeworld fans, you're not really missing anything from not having played those games.  You'll get right into it and know what's going on.\n\nThe game also looks great.  There's not a ton of color or detail in the maps, but that was likely intentional to a degree so that the devs could convey the vastness and emptiness of the Desert.  The units, however, look great, as do their weapon particles and physics.  Watching your units traverse the sands (bobbing up and down as you hit bumps, cresting dunes and sliding down) makes it obvious how much effort Gearbox put into this type of immersion.\n\nGetting into the gameplay itself, first impressions are really good.  Units are responsive, there's a lot of rock-paper-scissors going on and the units move fast enough and the weapons are powerful enough that you really have a lot to keep track of and do.  The battles themselves are exciting to watch too.  Units swarm around each other, artillery barrages throw up huge clouds of dust, and weapons all make satisfying BOOMS and impacts.  I had a great time playing the campaign and even on Normal difficulty there were quite a few tense moments.  I BARELY won the final mission, with my carrier within 10% health on a last ditch all-in attack to finish the objective.\n\nWhere I think this game lacked for me is in content.  Ultimately, I don't think there's enough there to justify the price tag.  The campaign was way too short.  I finished it in about 8-10 hours and while it was good, I expected it to be a lot longer.  This was disappointing.\n\nAdditionally, I don't see a large multiplayer community thriving around the game either.  I'd love if that weren't the case, but there doesn't seem to be enough content, unit variety or balance to encourage anything long term.  There's a TINY number of multiplayer maps and they're fairly small.  Like Homeworld, skirmishing and resource harrassment are a huge part of how the game plays out.  Unlike Homeworld, however, full scale engagements don't last very long.  Airstikes and artillery can make short work of large numbers of units and it really throws off the pacing of the game.  This might be addressed in balancing but personally it felt to me like the game, while polished and fun, was trimmed down more than it should be in terms of features and variety.\n\nHonestly, I enjoyed it.  I don't regret buying it but at the same time I'm not thrilled with the purchase.  It's likely to be another game that entertained me briefly but that I'll ultimately forget about.\n\n","January 24","true","10.8"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Although it started off its life as more of a spiritual successor, Gearbox acquired the developer, allowing Blackbird to use the Homeworld IP and it doesn't feel slapped on. Every part of the product, from the gameplay to the presentation, is oozing with original Homeworld flavor, with the exception, of course, of 3D movement.

I have upped my non-preorder score. I utimately feel as though I rewarded for rolling the dice and buying a game without reading any reviews. After being burned hard by Gearbox for Aliens: Colonial Marines, the company has regained my loyalty. Thanks Gearbox and Blackbird Interactive.\n\nHomeworld​: Deserts of Kharak is the best RTS game since StarCraft 2. Although at $49.99 it's a tough value proposition. As an owner of the Homeworld: Remastered Collection I got 20% off and an interactive encyclopedia worth $5.99. I'm a little miffed that the soundtrack was not included, $7.99, and you need to have the game to download it (DLC model). But hey I like pre-order bonuses.\n\nThe game is stripped down to a refined RTS core and the unit count represents that. Not quite MOBA simplified, but complex enough not to scare that crowd away. You've got a decent papers, rocks, scissors interplay going and a dedicated airstrike platform, your cruiser. If I compared the game to chess, the cruiser would be a queen/king combo. Lose it, you're dead. Yet properly upgraded it will wreck havoc and coordinated airstrikes with ground forces properly erases the opposition from the map, no matter how overwhelming. Cue me whooping like a falcon diving for the kill and a meal.\n\nI really like the cover system where elevation actively blocks direct fire and units firing from higher positions get a damage bonus which makes sense for a vehicle based RTS. Armored vehicles are weakest at their rear and turrets in true Company of Heroes fashion (if you like RTS play CoH). I play the game mostly from the satellite view since I like the interface and how informative it is. Relic and employees that used to work for that Canadian studio have the best audio guys in the business. Unit chatter is appropriately stoic with ironic wit (which I like), but most importantly provides valuable information. If a unit is being attacked instead of getting a ping saying "Yo dude. Your dudes are under attack. Pay attention!"\n\nThe intel officer or unit itself will simply say "Strike craft taking effective fire." Unit chatter can get layered, but the design is genius. It's almost like listening to sports on the radio and being able to picture the battle unfolding.\n\nIf I had anything negative to say it'd probably be that the game feels too basic at times, sometimes too slow for its own good, and has inconsistent performance. I also encountered a game breaking bug. Not quite Total War Rome 2's caliber where I actually rage quitted in frustration, but the devs were responsive and helpful. The game uses a lot of scripted sequences so I tend to finish secondary objective out of fear of breaking the primary ones.\n\nAll in all, a great purchase. 9/10 at $39.99 with pre-order bonus and discount. Wait for a steam sale and if you like RTS you'll fall in love with the game and plus the bugs will be ironed out.\n\n8.5/10 at $49.99 without expedition guide DLC. The game has quite the solid foundation and will post-release love it should get some wings and take flight. Like the Kushan people fleeing their dying planet where desert erosion slowly erases top soil. No top soil, no food. No food... well that's a terrible way to go if you have water and that's in short supply too.","January 22","true","23.1"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","3","6","0","0"

So when Homeworld remastered got released last year, I spent a huge amount of time working my way through the missions and the skirmish mode.\nWhen I found out that Shipbreakers wasn't far off I took the decision to stop playing and move onto something else , and a day after it was released as Deserts of Kharak I have already completed the games campaign in the easy mode.\n\nSo what does this game have to offer?\nIf you are a fan of the RTS games like C&C or Supreme Commander then this is a must for you, even if you didnt like the original homeworld games.\nThe ground orientated combat is merged seemlessly with homeworlds ambiance and storytelling as you guide an expidition though the war torn banded desert on the hunt for an artifact that will save your race.\n\nYup - you guessed it if you didnt already know, this is a prequel and you ultimatley find the Khar-Toba, which would lead onto the Guidestone, and onto Homeworld 1...\n\nWhat doesnt this game have?\nWell, I'd like to say a long story, its only 13 missions long which was a bit of a disapointment, i would have liked to have played a bit longer.\nAlso the game seems to end each mission very quickly not allowing you to harvest the local resources and find artifacts that remain. Surely a mission like this, that would be a key focus. Similar to homeworld 1.\nAlso there are only a handful of skirmish maps, so I am hoping the developers release some FREE DLC soon with added maps, maybe some of the missions converted into skirmish maps as each mission map was excellently crafted.\n\nAll-in-all this for homeworld fans and other RTS fans alike, this game is a must.\nBut remember if like me you have an older system to turn the graphics down before you launch into the campaign as its difficult to change the settings unless if you use the main menu options pannel. There is one mission in particular that is a graphics hog.\n\nSo why did i metion that I stopped playing the remastered games?\nI had a feeling that the last scene in the last mission would get me wanting to play the other games again.\nAnd I wasnt dissapointed when I heard something familiar in the last cutscene. Im looking forward to playing homeworld 1 again after this. And I hope we see more new homeworld coming soon!","January 21","true","21.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Until the end where it stops far far too short? If you aren't into Homeworld you are going to struggle with the plot imho because the ending isn't explained well at all almost as if they didn't want to fully cross over into HW1 territory just yet.\n\n- Had a go at MP with a friend and soon discovered an OP early game strategy which basically blows MP out the water for now.\n\nIn summary then the basic game is there and is solid but to me it feels like I'm playing 1/2 a game (and suspect the 2nd half is on its way in 1yr time). Its almost like Gearbox is testing the market to see if "Homeworld 2016" can work and opted for a shortened/summarised version.\n\nWould I recommend it? Yes I would, I wouldn't call it 9/10 material though it clearly had the potential if it was allowed to mature. Overall BBI did a good job and really their fault is in not releasing what I would call a complete and well-rounded game but what they have done they have done well. To draw an analogy a little like Elite Dangerous where what was done was good but there needs to be more for it to work properly for the player/User Experience.","January 26","true","21.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Just the sight of your fleet moving through desert at night can give you an aesthetic enjoyment.\n- Sound effects, music and units voice overs are 10/10.\n- On highest setting game looks very good and runs smooth on my 2014's hardware.\n- Quite balanced and fun gameplay in the best traditions of Homeworld series. There are two faction which looks similar to each other at first, but they have different strategies and tactics to dominate the desert battlefield. This reminds me Hiigarans and Vaygr from Homeworld 2, though the Coalition and Gaalsiens have even more differences.\n\nCons:\n\n- Just a five maps for skirmish and multiplayer. Developers already promissed more as free updates.\n- Very few option settings for skirmish and MP\n- Limping Gaalsien AI in skirmish. The Coalition one is much more aggressive even on easy, but still suffers from lack of "cunning" and variety of tactics.\n- There is no way to change hotkeys for now.\n\nDespite its minor and temporal flaws I can recommend this game to anyone who is looking for good singleplayer experience in RTS. Multiplayer is somewhat lacking for now, but I'm sure things will be fixed quite soon and more content will be added.","January 24","true","25.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

There's definitely some bad to it, but it's very solid. 8/10\n\nI am a long time RTS player and as far as game mechanics go, this game is in my top 5.\nVisually/atmospherically: This game is number 1. The music, the art, the effects, the feel, all of it are amazing.\n\nCurrently, the game loses a point for the multiplayer having too few maps. There are 13 story missions and I don't see how they couldn't reuse or rework story mission maps into skirmish maps. Perhaps that will happen later. Or even better, we will get player made ones.\n\nThe game also loses a point for some of the vehicle balance. LAV's are worthless. There is no point in having them except maybe as cannon fodder. You can run around with 4-5 AAV's, 4-5Rail guns, and 3-4 Missile AAV's and never get touched with a support cruiser in tow.\n\nAll in all, if this is what I can expect from BBI, I hope they continue the homeworld franchise.

A beautiful re-imagining of the original games, modernized similar to the HD re-releases Gearbox put out earlier this year.  From its unique art style, rousing music, to its masterful balance of your typical rock paper scissor mechanics found in most RTS games, its about as polished and well made as any RTS game released in the last decade.\n\nThe story, while a bit light, which is usual for games in this genre, still manages to hit the right notes and provide some great Sci Fi story telling.  It provides a thrilling backstory to the Homeworld universe, with unique a varied mission objectives.  I didn't mind the desert environments, each map feeling hand crafted.\n\nIf I had any complaints, it was the length of the campaign.  Similar to the previous homeworlds, it only had 13 missions in total.  There were several late game units that I didn't feel I had time to learn how to use, or bring to bare in an exciting way against my enemies.  Aircraft can also feel like an "I win" button for several early mission, but are balanced later in the game when anti air vehicles become more prevalent.\n\nThe land carrier, which takes the place of the mother-ship from previous games, feels a bit too strong.  I did enjoy the overhead mechanics which had me switching between systems, but with a few repair vehicles near by I never felt it was at threat.\n\nOver all, one of the best RTS games I've played in years.  More grand strategy, then your typical Star Craft twitch / micromanagement play style.\n\nI'm really hoping they continue the Homeworld series.","January 24","true","11.8"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The campaign, while quite good for the most part, has a frustrating last mission/ending (although maybe they assume most who are playing have also played the first Homeworld game, which takes place soon afterward) and fewer missions than I would've liked. The art style is terrific, although certain things, like the textures, are a little muddy (it also drops a lot of frames in parts where I feel it shouldn't; I have a GTX 970 with an i7 3.5 Ghz CPU and 8 Gigs of DDR3). I have yet to try multiplayer, but there only appears to be 5 maps, which for an RTS in 2016 is too low. The game itself alot fun to play, with cool unit design, old school RTS gameplay and some pretty unique game mechanics. The vehicle physics are particularly impressive, with dune buggies jumping and tumbling all over the place. There are only two factions in the game, as has always been the case with the Homeworld franchise, which didn't bother me as much as it might others. There aren't a WHOLE lot of units, but there are tons of upgrades that offer them a great deal of flexibility. I am hoping that Black Bird Interactive will add more multiplayer maps soon, as I believe that interest in this game will die pretty quickly with only the 5 available (which would be a huge shame).  In short, if this game were even $10.00 cheaper I wouldn't hesitate recommending it to anyone, but at its current price I suggest you check out gameplay videos and get a feeling for it. If the asking price doesn't scare you away and you like supporting small, new and promising development studios (or just the Homeworld franchise), you'll get plenty of RTS bang out of your buck from DoK.","January 25","true","16.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I chose normal difficulty on my first playthrough, and never even came close to losing a mission. On my second playthrough, I chose the harder 'classic' difficulty, and only lost once, (Due to my own stupidity, not the difficulty of the mission).\n\nThe storyline is nice, although the campaign feels quite short, and ends on a rather dull note, in my opinion at least. And from the outset, you are told the objective in the desert will lead to the salvation of the Kushun people, but why? How do they know this? Just seems like strange dialogue to have so early in the game when they aren't even sure what they are going to find out there in the desert.\n\nI found the campaign to be nicely immersive however, and it seems a lot of thought and development has gone into the technology and engineering of the units, for how a civilization living on a desert planet would design their vehicles and such.\n\nThe camera is somewhat annoying as well, much of the time I found it very claustrophobic outside of the sensors manager (The blue map you get when you hit spacebar), and there isn't a lot of range to zoom in and out, it is capped at a very low altitude. Unit selection is kind of a pain too, there is no military-priority selection, so dragging a big box around everything is only going to select everything.\n\nPathfinding AI is quite bad too, on my second playthrough I tried building a lot of cruisers to form a carrier battlegroup, but most of them wouldn't follow my carrier properly, and would sit still trying to engage an enemy unit that wasn't within their line of sight.\n\nThere are no formation controls as far as I can see, and no proper positioning for units in formations, when told to guard/escort your carrier, all the utility units place themselves on the outside of the formation (where they will get killed by the first unit that attacks you), instead of hugging close to the carrier like you would expect.\n\nThere isn't a lot of content either, I seem to remember there being a much bigger variety of units in the other HW games, in this game you have;\nA resource collector\nLight attack vehicle (Scissors)\nArmoured Assault Vehicle (Rock)\nRailgun (Paper)\nBaserunner (minelayer)\n4 x kinds of cruisers\nA fighter\nA bomber\n\nThat is it, so overall it is a very simple game, there aren't different kinds of frigates or corvettes like we had in the other games. But this is partially compensated for by your carrier (mothership) which can shunt power and be used offensively, defensively, or as a support ship.\n\nThere are only 5 multiplayer maps too, which is a shame because it could really use the variety. I am presuming they will bring out more DLC to rectify this (Which we will have to pay for).\n\nBut overall, I am happy with my purchase, if you like homeworld, you will probably like this. If you aren't familiar with homeworld, I would probably just stick with the remastered collection, at least acquiant yourself with it before buying this one, because the story of this game really depends on your knowledge of the other games.\n","January 25","true","32.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The controls and gameplay were solid, and having played Homeworld and Homeworld 2, despite it being on a flat plan this go round, I eased right into these controls in a heartbeat. There were a few moments where I got frustrated that ships would venture off faster than their battle group, and thus wind up in situations where they were essentially screwed and I had to bite the loss, but it wasn't an issue often.\n\nIt looks breathtaking, if such a word can be used for desert landscapes, but I feel in this instance it can. I ran the game full bore, and it was smooth, no noticable drops in FPS, and at lulls in battles or resource gathering, I found myself just panning around and moving the camera just to take in the landscape. It is a beautiful game.\n\nI think the only let down was the story, and only in it's length. I threw the difficulty up to the hardest, which in this game is labeled classic, and got through it in about 16 hours. Granted, I spent the extra time gathering resources, anticipating a potential nasty and gritty pitched battle later (experience early in the game taught me to be prepared), so that adds considerable time to my play, but it still felt short as campaigns go, despite some great missions. Of note was a mission where you have to defend an ally, and I was on the edge of my seat sending support flights over to attack enemy positions and repair ships to keep my allies in the fight. Plot wise though, it was exciting to play through the prequel to Homeworld, and feel the race-against-time tension that the story exhibits. It's entertaining and fun to see the Homeworld universe lore expand through this game, and I can see them adding DLC or another game playing out the political landscape of Kharak more.\n\nOne thing of note: Multiplayer. I gave it a shot...but, and this could just be it's a Saturday night, no one was on. I mean no one. I could not find a game to save my life. I hope this is just a fluke, because it would be exciting to play online, but that was my experience. We'll see.\n\n","May 28","true","16.4"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I'll update this after I finish the game.  So take this as a first impressions after getting a few missions under my belt.\n\nI played a lot of homeworld back in the day.  I really enjoyed it.   For me this has fell a bit flat.   I'll list out some pros and cons I've felt playing it.\n\npros:\n+ homeworld kinda-feel\n+ carrier can behave as a unit that is very effective depending on how you distribute the power\n+ nostalgia around the control scheme\n+ unit persistence\n+ tech upgrades\n+ beautiful, although somewhat boring, terrain\n+ simplification of y axis movement (or maybe removed?)\n\ncons:\n- physics engine almost seems not to exist.\n-  height advantage is nice in theory, but is a constant struggle as you fight the camera to figure out where high ground is relative to other units.\n-  constant fighting with control scheme and figuring out which units are which.\n- textures are inconsistent.   Some are decent, others are just horrible.\n- missions seem to follow a formula that is as predictable as ever.   Do something non-combat related, prepare to trigger waves of enemies.\n- scale of stuff is really strange and disappointing.   Some of the cut scenes have the correct scale, but then you have a ship that fits a few people in it (like the science team unit) and the giant carrier not looking as big as it should outside of a cutscene.   I get it, a lot of RTS do this, but there's some weirdness in that sometimes scale is preserved and sometimes it isn't.  Plus, with the camera zooming functions you kinda expect reasonably to scale.\n- story seems to try to replicate the homeworld experience,  like with the launching of the carrier -- but it just doesn't feel as grand.   It feels like you're a petty raider.   Story not very well explained as to even what your character understand of the world.\n-  objectives seem very outward facing without the original story and characters backing up your fight for survival.\n-  unit persistence can cause some problems at higher difficulty if you barely win a mission.  Mitigating this is the option to use a default set of units for the mission.\n-  knowing where you can move units based on height of terrain is difficult or impossible until you try to move.\n\nRight now my feeling is if you are a die hard homeworld fan like myself you will find this generally enjoyable.   For others I can't really recommend the game.  Will update after I finish.\n","January 20","false","3.8"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","15","31","0","1"

Great product gone bad. Here is an outlook of the first 3 months of release...\n\nInitial impression, Engaging campaign, Gorgeous landscape and graphics, overall gameplay and physics pretty spot on.\n\nThen came the multiplayer/comp stomp experience... absolutely awful. I look to the maps available and at release I believe it was 4... yes, 4 maps. Games in the 1990's had a better selection of battlegrounds to wage war on (since then they've slowly added but every other game out there has more maps still) .Region locking issues, the worst AI i've ever encountered in a game. I've played starcraft, total annihilation, red alert, warcraft, dawn of war, company of heroes... yes.. this game blows with AI. Some AI units dont respond when being attacked, some games it's the same 5 scout units routinely attacking me in 5min intervals, some games you literally could win with 1 type of unit, the AI is not intelligent.\n\nThen came cash grab tactics.. Look at the release date, Jan 20th. In two months after release they release a PAID fleet pack. 2 months after the game came out!! Oh wait, they put another fleet pack out a month after that one too! If you can whip out two fleet packs but take two months to make one AI patch that had a minimal impact on AI\n\nIt's ridiculous on how developers are about cash grabs and taking advantage of the faithful like myself who preordered the game and have been a lifelong fan of homeworld.\n\nMy suggestion, wait til the game comes on sale for about 20 bucks and you can enjoy some pretty visuals, a decent campaign, and lackluster AI.\n\nRecap:\n+ Visuals, Gameplay mechanics, Campaign\n- Annoying Bugs, Unresponsive/Lackluster AI, Greedy Devs, Weak online community/multiplayer, limited map selection\n","May 6","false","8.9"," 10 of 21 people (48%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","48","10","21","0","0"

The negative feedback I have is such:\n\nMap Texture quality\nSeems very low, I am running the game on maximum settings and the sand and scenery simply doesn't add the same atmosphere that you see in the pre-rendered footage.\n\nNo Unit Interactions like Homeworld 1-2\nUnit interactions are a generation behind the original homeworld games. In Homeworld 1, when your resource harvester collected materials and returned to hand them in, you could actually watch it dock with your resource controller/mothership and transfer the resources back.\n\nThe resource controller in DoK looks like it was going to have something similar, but they didn't finish implementing it, instead, when your resource collectors reach your collector, the mineral bar vanishes and they move off for their next collection.\n\nNo Docking\nAnother cool and fun Sci-fi aspect of Homeworld was docking, the fact that after a run, you could dock your strike craft with your mothership or carriers for more efficient repairs (and in Catacylsm, retro-fitting), there is no docking in DoK, once your carrier spits out a new unit it outside for good, with the extremely shot repair range on the other vessels, repairing large groups of small craft is fiddly and annoying rather than engaging and fun.\n\nWith your main 'mothership' in DoK being a Carrier, I was expecting the same mechanic\n\nCutscene Rendering\nSeveral of the cut-scenes seem a little poorly rendered, the art-style itself is fantastic, but again on a modern game on a very high-end PC, I expected more crisp visuals than how they are displaying on my PC.\n\nZoom controls\nThese seem way too limited, I find myself constantly wanting to zoom out more, the maximum limit feels very claustraphobic, resulting in an awful lot of scrolling around and quick-tabbing to the sensors manager just to view short distances, unlike again the original homeworld games where you could zoom out to a great degree for unit selection and controls\n\nomfg, why is the main menu on F10 and not ESC like 99% of games?!?!\nI was taking part in a mission and needed to pause, to my surprise, ESC did nothing, I started spamming every key on the keyboard until suddenly one of them opened the game menu, I was then able to check the key-bindings (which, are fixed btw and cannot be remapped) and discover that mid-game, the main menu is accessed from F10 (whyyyyyyyyyyyyy).\n\nSummary\nMaybe my expectations are too high, considering that Homeworld 1 + 2 are multi-award, ground breaking titles, but I at least, from my perspective was expecting more, not because it's a homeworld prequal, but but because it was made by the core guys that made the original HW games, I was expecting an evolution of mechanics, not a simplification that in many ways looks like a step-back to me, or, unfinished implementation due to a rushed development and launch.","January 20","false","1.3"," 65 of 132 people (49%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","49","65","132","6","29"

As many others here have stated, the Homeworld series has been one of the most memorable and enjoyable games for me. When this game was released I immediately recognized the potential for this game. The main issue is this game doesn’t feel like it was completed. It is plagued by performance issues with constant slowdowns during battles and when there are more than a couple dozen units on the map it slows to a crawl. Also, the AI is absolutely ridiculous and completely unaware of anything going on around it. I figured they would release patches to fix these major issues, but they decided to release DLC’s instead. I would only recommend this game to the most extreme HW fans. Other than that, extremely disappointed.","May 1","false","9.3"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

At most, this is a $15-20 game.\n\nIt's short, it's small (small maps and so few units), the camera is too darn close, and the story doesn't add much to the Homeworld lore.

Very linear story, not a lot of change of scenary, relatively short campaign, no real closure at the end.\n\nArtistically it's an amazingly beautiful game.  The ship/structure designs are top notch, and the visuals and cut scenes are wonderous pieces of art, but it really feels more like an episode of a telltale game more than a fleshed out world.\n\nThere is not a lot of replayability in the game despite multiplayer but few of my friends even got the game, so it heralds back to an age where massively multiplayer options were just not an option.  Lastly it feels like the difficulty ramps down slowly from the beginning then immediately near the end they dump more power than you'd ever be able to really need or want, so it steals any excitement near the crucial climax of the game.\n\nIf you have nothing else you'd rather play, or spend your money on, the game is still very homeworld-esque.  Great music score, amazing visuals in mechanical design, and cut scenes, but ultimately it feels like an incomplete story, no denouement almost at all, and odd unveiling of tech progression that holds the best till last stealing a lot of the challenge from early game.","February 21","false","8.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I've yet to encounter any bugs or crashes, a huge contrast from playing Fallout 4's infestation of (mostly non-breaking) bugs. The developers did well doing QA on this game.\n\nResponse time is excellent and pathing is mostly fantastic. I've yet to witness any issues with units being stuck or causing unwanted collisions. With that said, all the maps are open deserts with minimal obstructions so not much can go wrong.\n\nThere's only about a dozen units per faction and the other faction has a mirroring unit with minor differences. This is far from being comparable to Starcraft 2 nor Company of Heroes 2. You can dumb it down to being a two dimensional plane version of Homeworld but it's much more refreshing to play.\n\nSingle Player Campaign\nOverall, I enjoyed the single player campaign experience but it was lucklustre. I just wish there was more going on, be it in the background or actively part of the campaign. There's no "critters" or random environment props and units disappear after being destroyed. To be fair, there were sand storms in one of the missions.\n\nI don't consider myself to be an RTS expert and I don't think my APM is high enough to brag about, but I managed to complete the campaign on the hardest difficulty and was only defeated twice - once on two seperate missions.\n\nThe campaign is also linear and you only get to play as one of the two factions in the game. I was actually hoping that I get to play another 13 missions as the opposing faction. However, the amount of detail and production to produce the cutscenes and dialogue was fantastic!\n\nThere's no ingame mechanic to compel you to replay the campaign again, once you finish it on hardest mode, you get 3 out of a maximum of 3 stars. It'd be fantastic to see how well you did on different runs of the campaign, particularly stats that show how much resources/time/etc were made during that run. Would also be fun to see how you fare against your friends!\n\nMultiplayer / Skirmish\nThere's only 5 maps. No joke.\n\nThe only challenge you find here is if you play multiplayer against real players, the AI, for the time being, is way too easy than it should be.\n\nThere's two modes that you can choose to play, artefact retrieval and annihilation. Artefact retrieval is an interesting idea, artefacts are spawned based off a timer mechanic and the first player/team to meet the target amount wins.\n\nThere is also a unit cap of 125 in multiplayer, which feels unusual and I suspect there is a reason to this other than fps performance or balance.\n\nConsidering the abysmal amount of maps included, if they had additional multiplayer modes such as King of the Hill or Company of Heroes' Capture the Flag/Points, that would at least give players more options to play with.\n\nThe developers have included skins/theme mechanic for players to customise their army colours but I wasn't able to pick a different theme other than the default. You can change the primary and secondary paint scheme though, so that's something I guess.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nWhile I appreciate the amount of work that has been put into this game, particularly the single player campaign, I simply cannot justify the price.\n\nI just finished a comp stomp in Company of Heroes 2 and I definately enjoyed that more than the skirmish experience in this game.\n\nWishlist:\nAn additional single player campaign. DLC for the Gaalsian?\nAdditional faction to differentiate between the existing two\nNeeds more units and/or secondary active abilities. (Carrier with docking capabilities?)\nAdditional multiplayer modes and winning condition options\nHarder AI\nReasons to replay the campaign\nMore multiplayer maps\n$15-$30 expansion\nUltimately, I think the game is great and the developers are incredibly talented.

Playing the original on Windows 98 when I was 7 got me into gaming, and since then I've played hundreds of games, yet none have matched Homeworld's place in my heart. Naturally, expectations were high for this game, perhaps unfairly so.\n\nNeedless to say I was super excited to hear another Homeworld game was being made, but was equally terrified when it was announced it wouldn't be in space. Here's the impressions I've gotten so far (Mission 7, about 6 hours in)\n\nPositives:\nThe story is great, like Homeworld stories always are.\nStrong voice acting - it's nice to have several people to identify with rather than just Karan S'Jet.\nCompelling enigmatic enemy - knowing the lore of the subsequent games makes it a lot more fun to learn about the Gaalsien.\nSoundtrack is classic Homeworld - almost too similar - did they actually use the same sound files?\nCinematics are much improved - I loved seeing the interiors of the "ships" and the character's faces.\nImproved chatter - background chatter when things are slow really helps to build the immersion.\nArtifacts - although it seems to break with the HW canon, shipbreaking and collecting artifacts to beef up your ships is fun.\n\nAlas, despite all that is done well here, there are some things that at least for now have made it tough to recommend this game.\n\nNegatives:\nUnless you have a BRAND NEW beast of a machine, this game won't look good. I have a 4th gen i7, 8GB of RAM, and a 2GB dedicated Nvidia 745m with Windows 10, and it BARELY runs on the lowest settings. As such, my framerate is horrific, and the textures are so bad it reminds me of the 98 version of HW1. This confuses me, as I have beautiful games like Ethan Carter and HW Remastered running at 60fps on ultra. With such a laggy framerate (I'm lucky if I hit 30), immersion is instantly broken. Guess it's time to save up for yet another rig?\n\nSpace is Homeworld's secret ingredient:\nI liked the idea of a prequel on Kharak, but space is what Homeworld does best. Watching little trucks dance around each other shooting 50 cals isn't nearly as glorious or boner-inducing as gigantic spaceships blowing the crap out of each other with big lasers. I tried so hard to like the ground fight, but the next HW project REALLY needs to head back out to space! PLEASE!\n\nUnits die INCREDIBLY fast.\nI get it - Homeworld is designed to be a challenge by forcing you to discern the correct strategy (that's what makes it fun.) But this game punishes you like other Homeworlds never did. Your fleet will be wiped out in less than 30 seconds if you make one mistake in building your fleet. As such, you have to save OFTEN and reload those checkpoints more than I'd like.\n\nNo resources\nOn one hand, I like the sense of desperation having little to no resources gives. But when my fleets are being wiped out in an instant and there are no resources left, I'm SOL and have to start again. Worse still, the old HW's had a mechanic that automatically collected any RU's left over at the end of a mission. Not the case here! Your mission will suddenly complete and your mining will be left unfinished, leaving you with nothing to rebuild next mission. While you can use a "default" fleet, that just feels like a cheat to me.\n\nUnder constant assault\nSo far, with the exception of the first mission, I have been under constant attack on multiple fronts, meaning 90% of my time is spent in the map instead of absorbing the beautiful desert world Blackbird worked so hard on building. I have no problem with coming under attack, but let me smell the desert roses a little first!\n\nI love the Homeworld universe to death and want to support this game in hopes of a HW3, but be warned - you need a beast PC to run this - and going from 3 dimensions to 2.5 will feel like a step in the wrong direction.","January 22","false","9.4"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","43","3","7","0","0"

You can't analyze the battle, and figure out the right commands.  There's no time for that.  You can either flounder around, losing way too many vehicles, or you can play a mission enough times that you have the coreography memorized.  That's not RTS.  It's essentially no different than dance dance revolution.\n\n\nA good RTS gives you time to thihnk.  Sometimes that means a PAUSE feature, other times it means how the battle is paced.\n\nTime to think isn't facilitated by ape-ing the beginning levels of the OTHER 3 homewolrd games, where you're frantically escaping from something.  What makes it brainless apeing,  and not "payiing homage"...?  In the other Homeworld games, running out of tme was a clever illusion you're meant to see through.

Lots of crashing, lots of lag, do I not have enough playtime to judge? Well you can thank DoK for that.\n\nSeems to be lacking in content, and mostly sadly of all, character. All cutscenes I've seen feel about 10-20 seconds too short, everything seems very clipped and concise. Leaves a jarring feeling when an epic homeworld opera starts playing during a cutscene which then immediately ends, cutting the music off. No fade to silence or you know... appropriate music choices for a cutscene that they know is only about 5-10 seconds long, nooo, just let it cut right out in the middle of a crescendo, fine, whatever. There really just hasn't been enough exposition and cutscene usage in general so far, and don't point me to the expedition guide, because I didn't buy an interactive game to read an encyclopedia.\n\nWhen I can play the game, I'm flying through missions with 0 losses on classic difficulty, which makes me seriously concerned about the brief 13 missions I'll get for my money. Nothing has any sense of importance or grandeur, most mission briefings, what there are of them, tell me how difficult a slog it's to be to get to X and then the mission becomes "well here we are at X, tally ho". Yeah, well done BBI, a modern day epic. "Oh hey, build this unit" is the only description of a new unit I receive, along with two arbitrary upgrades, again with no introduction and just "oh hey we can immediately make everything better whenever we decide you can build something". Everything just feels rushed and sloppy. Some part of the desert visuals look nice, other parts look quite poor, not a great deal of consistency despite it being the one terrain they had to do. A single terrain and it doesn't even look that great lots of the time.\n\nGenerally I'm just underwhelmed entirely by the level of attention to detail and storytelling ability displayed. There's no real interaction between units and where there is it's done in a very joyless fashion. Harvesters just bob back and forth between resources and resource controller, no docking and unloading, just "boop" and it's all unloaded and back to work once it gets close enough. No docking of your land units with your land carrier, only fighters can and they're really more of just an additional carrier special ability. There's none of the nice interactions of units like in Homeworld.\n\nMaybe I'm just tired and grouchy, sick of constant crashes. I'll revisit this review as and when there is a patch, though I doubt anything will be done to fix any of my main gripes so far. Don't worry though, I hear some paid DLC will be coming soon, woopdidoo, have some more nostalgia money.\n\nEdit: So two patches in and there have been minor balance changes... no bug fixes. Wonderful.\n\nAnd BBI seem to just be letting the Steam forums fester instead of maintaining or posting information in them. I feel this game is just going to fizzle out.\n\nEdit 2: I played through bugs and crashes and 13 missions for a 10 second outro? Are you kidding me? This game is worth about £10 at most. Terrible story telling and a waste of the franchise and the good ideas it used up pointlessly.","February 1","false","13.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waywardRTS/recommended/281610/","waywardRTS","wayward","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waywardRTS/","95 products in account","This is a portion of a larger review... if you want to read the whole thing, I put a link at the bottom.\n\nDeserts of Kharak’s strongest element is assuredly its campaign. The campaign is hauntingly atmospheric, full of starkly vast spaces and lonely stretches of desert, and challenging. I’ll touch on this more in my next section. The multiplayer, at least in the game’s launch state, falls short of the promise of the game’s mechanics.\n\nOne of the strongest and most interesting elements of the game is the Carrier’s mobility. However, in both the campaign and the multiplayer, this seems oddly de-emphasized. It is as if the developers were being cautious, or were unsure of how to design around this unique feature. In the campaign, the Carrier is often left up on a plateau or stuck down in the dunes, while its armies swarm around the map completing objectives and fighting Gaalsien battlegroups. Similarly, in multiplayer, I seldom found myself moving the Carrier much, if at all, especially when playing Gaalsien.\n\nThe layout of most multiplayer matches incorporates a somewhat traditional RTS setup, with roughly a third or so of each map sectioned off into a “base sector” or “home turf” for each player, and it is in these that most or all resources on the map are found. The central and contested map area tends to feature the mach objectives: 3 automatically respawning relics Artifacts that must be collected by a player’s Baserunner and deposited at their drop-off zone. The first player to retrieve 5 of these Artifacts (or who destroys their opponent’s Carrier) is the winner.\n\nIn practice, this setup actually works fairly well for the most part, aside from the negligible mobility requirements for the Carrier (which to me are a crying shame). Conceptually, I have some deep issues with this setup.\n\nFirst of all, despite the attention to detail the rest of the game receives, drop-off areas are just an arbitrarily-placed ring of pylons on the map. There’s no real asset or logically-driven factor behind the placement of these zones: the only goal was apparently to have such a zone and to place it in an area of the map roughly equidistant to each player’s start location. In terms of map design, it’s functional but scarcely supportable. Any existing game asset: structures, dropships, some sort of supply cache etc, would make this design more sensible within the game’s context. I certainly hope that future map designs take into account the story they’re telling. What are they delivering their artifacts to?\n\nAlso, the Artifacts themselves automatically self-extract at regular intervals. Sensible, to be sure, but again a bit uninspired. Perhaps such a design was tested and turned down, but I can’t help but want my Baserunner to have to manually extract each Artifact, and to defend it while the artifact is extracted, and then defend it (as is currently the case in multiplayer) en route to the drop-off zone. Such a system should seem to feel, to me, more satisfying mechanically as well as in the context of the story. Should they release modding tools for the game, I plan to test such a system myself.\n\nThe pacing of multiplayer feels appropriate to me, with matches tending to last around 10 minutes if the players are matched well, the player constantly expanding their force and building new units, the choices the player is making being meaningful: tech to air, or focus on railguns, or power through to cruisers? Scouting is difficult, thanks to Carriers coming equipped with weapons of not inconsiderable firepower.\n\nActually, I have found that Carriers are well situated within the context of the game. They’re able to take out small groups of units early on, but midgame armies give them pause, and can wear them down over time. Late-game units pose a serious threat, and if Carriers take them out, it would be with considerable damage to their hulls. So, the Carrier ends up being a powerful supporting unit without devolving into a MOBA-style hero (which would be a tragedy).\n\nWith access to the full unit lists of both factions, I’ve become more-or-less at peace with the unit design in Deserts of Kharak. Unit abilities are a welcome addition, such as the Gaalsien Missle Cruiser’s ground-targeted area of effect attack, which damages friendly units as well as foes, and is a counter to enemy light attack vehicles only if it manages to hit them. Rail Guns still feel odd to me as an alternative to artillery weapons, but as I mention in my preview, they work well with the game’s line of sight system so I can appreciate the choice.\n\nAir units feel quite powerful, but I believe that a recent patch (released shortly before the publication of this article) implemented a balance fix to air units. Additionally, in opposition to my earlier statement, air units can, in fact, be individually controlled, though their default area attack command is a simple way to get some mileage out of them. They are best handled through the sensors manager, by the way.\n\nOn the topic of air units, the game’s counter system escalates greatly with the addition of Air, and Cruisers, each of which require a deep commitment from the opposing player in order to properly counter. Cruisers have many times the hull integrity of smaller craft, making them require a significant anti-armor investment from opponents, and air units move fast and hit hard, requiring (again) significant preparation from opponents to properly counter.\n\nhttp://waywardstrategist.com/2016/02/02/in-the-dunes-the-carriers-deserts-of-kharak-non-review/","February 3","true","17.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The campaign, as you'd expect from a team responsible for the original Homeworld, Dawn of War, and Company of Heroes series, is amazing. Depending on difficulty, it's only about 10-15 hours though. Anyone who considers themselves a fan of RTS owes it to themselves to play it at some point, but not for this price. I'd suggest waiting for 50% off. The MP community is already fairly dead just a few weeks after release. The MP portion is pretty threadbare - not many maps, no replay system, matches last about 15-30 minutes. The depth of tactics and strategy is not comparable to the games mentioned above. It does have veterancy, unit abilities, and some nice terrain/line of site mechanics but would need a lot of work and expansions to give it more depth and lasting appeal. I suspect that won't happen though.","February 4","true","65.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

After 6 hours of gameplay, I am already deleting this title from my library because the gameplay already tastes stale like a soda gone warm and drunk the next day.\n","January 22","false","6.9"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

On discount (50%) it is much better value.\n\nMy whole issue with this game is its depth; it just feels rushed.\n\nPros\nExplosions look great and feel satisfying - the way lightning arcs through the plumes of black sandy smoke looks awsome. Carrier explosions are unfortunatly the other side of this coin and are pretty lackluster.\nThe in mission atmosphere, generated by the ambient unit chatter ect, can feel amazing especially when combat gets going.\nThe game feels like a homeworld game which is nostalgic.\nThe units that are there, are fun to use.\nI enjoyed the story, even if it does feel a bit rushed towards the end.\nThe music fits will into the game and brings a lot of life to some of the duller missions.\nThe game runs pretty well on highest settings on 4k despite my rig ageing a bit.\n\n(2500k @ 4.5, 24GB ram, 290x 4GB, SSD, Win10)\nCons\n\nThe minor stuff (which could get fixed by patches)\n\nThe game crashes. I had 4 .exe has stopped working on my 10 hours play through the campaign.\nBuggy unit targeting priority - rail guns which are basically incapable of hitting the sandskirmishers (lighter vehicles) but will consistently target them despite other targets being available.\nMore buggy unit behavior - Bombers will often fly over their targets and simply not drop any bombs.\nVisual bugs - aircraft are often invisible until they have left the end of the carrier ramp and cruise missiles will clip through vehicles and terrain before hitting their target.\nUnit clipping - light ground vehicles will drive through structures they are targeting.\nThe major stuff which really hurts the game.\n\nVery poor unit diversity - Where are the dreadnoughts ect?! This feels like Homeworld 1/2 with everything above a destroyer removed.\nThe Galsean (or however you spell the name) feel really underbaked in Multiplayer - they even have less units than the  Coalition! I find it odd that the Coalition get a fast battleship style ship which hovers (when all the rest of their units are tracked) and the Galsean feel like they are missing just such a unit. Was the side swapped because of poor unit diversity in the campaign for the Coalition?\nNo more resource ships docking like in Homeworld :(.\nHad this game has more units and a couple more single player missions with more variety this would have been a huge thumbs up. In the state it's in, with crashes and abysmal unit diversity I have to say don't buy! Hopefully BBI can patch in some diversity and make this game what it could have been!","January 22","false","11.5"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

I might even make a review about it on youtube, since there's a lot to discuss. In the end however, to do that here would end up in a TL:DR for most people. So I will simply say this:  when compared to Command and Conquer (C&C) 3, arguably the greatest land-based RTS game ever created (and from where I think this game got a lot of its inspiration from), this newest title of the beloved Homeworld franchise falls short of the RTS genre standard in its current state. In truth the game, without all of the bugs it has right now (and they are Legion, even causing my game to crash while in a skirmish here and there), comes off a lot more like C&C 4--what with the whole mobile base and hardly any fixed structures thing.\n\nDon't get me wrong. I like this game. I think it has massive potential. But the gameplay is restrictive, nothing on the villain's side I've played seems to work, In fact the Gaalsiens seem very rushed. And overall there seems to be an insufficient amount of asymmetrical gameplay between the two factions. It is there, but there could be more, WAY more.\n\nThat all briefly said, I cannot recommend this game where it is now. Although, I do trust that there will be patches and definite DLC content added to this game. Being a student of business and the entrainment industry, I know what the developers have done with this title. It's a thing that's happening all over film, television, and gaming right now. It's this idea that "less is more." And in the case of Homeworld:  Deserts of Kharak, delivering LESS very much equals the fans wanting MORE. Gearbox, Blackbird, I WANT MORE! So they've done their jobs. What I'm asking for NOW is that this game receives the love, through patching, that it deserves. Get it working, place more unit variety in the game with more unique abilities, and it will be great! I just know it.\n\n*And for godsakes! Please remove the Gaalsien assualt cruiser as a coalition build option! It's utterly immersion breaking! And get a third faction in there! One with a flying carrier that's heavily reliant on support/assualt aircraft! As I said, MORE!\n\nGood job.","January 21","false","24.3"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","40","2","5","0","0"

But there are too many little things keeping it from being good. As it is, it can be enjoyable at times, but it is no homeworld.\n\nThe unit control is terrible. Airstrikes are easily wasted at no fault of the player - they almost made air units work in a cool way, but they didnt pull it off by what I can only assume is laziness. You can't even save groups for air units - once they dock to reload, any grouping is gone, so you either have to waste a lot of time whenever you launch something, or let the ai waste their single shot on whatever they see first.\n\nUnits get stuck on each other. Units have to be babied or else they will get stuck behind hills, potentially not contributing to a fight at all. There is no way to control what formation your units take, and there is no way to move a formation to face the way you want it, meaning your guys will run in one at a time in a line rather than as a wall unless you take a ton of time to set them up manually every single time you want them to move together correctly. Also, if you have units of different speeds in a formation (so more than one type of unit at all), they dont match the slowest speed, but instead rush in one unit type at a time rather than as a full force. Combat often boils down to an ugly point blank mess within seconds regardless of what you do, usually resulting in the bigger force winning. There is a way to make it feel like combat is random and frantic and unpredictable, and I doubt that is what they were going for here but regardless it doesnt work.\n\nAlso everything is extremely rock-paper-scissorsy, and not in a good subtle way like the previous homeworlds. The way damge is handled and how this-unit-ALWAYS-beats-that-unit feels more like starcraft or command and conquer, or some old 2d rts. That type of game may have its place, but I dont feel that place should be in the homeworld series.\n\nThe camera sucks. You can't rotate or zoom at the same time, or rotate and move, etc. When you rotate, it doesnt keep your mouse position where you left it, so if you rotate ~45 degrees, youll be on the edge of the screen when you let off, making you pan, which gets really annoying really fast. Also, as far as im concerned, the camera doesnt zoom out far enough without going into the sensor overlay mode. The entire game feels too close nomatter what is happening. It feels like someone copy-pasted some crap code off a unity rts camera tutorial and said "good enough" becasue suckers like me would buy it, and paid youtube dumbasses would sell it to people who have never heard of homeworld.\n\nThere is no mod support as far as I can tell, though I havent looked into it much. Considering how well Gearbox did with the remasted version of Homeworld 1 and 2 and implimented the steam workshop, its kind of lame they didnt do the same here.\n\nMultiplayer is extremely limited, and the AI is horrendous so dont even worry about skirmish.\n\nUnlike the rest of the game, the story and cinematics are very well done and are what you'd expect from a homeworld title. The visuals give a feeling remnicent of homeworld 1 and 2 despite being in a desert and on the ground, and were often the only reason I remembered I was playing a homeworld title at times. Also a big plus is the expedition guide, which goes into detail about the history of Kharak, and its really nicely set up.\n\nDespite all the problems, it can be fun at times, but it's the same enjoyment that can come from any generic game. There is way too much getting in the way of it living up to its title, which is a shame becasue the potential is there.","January 24","false","17.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

The is some enjoyment to be found but its short lived and just not worth the price tag or time. The are a number of major issues I have with this game.\n\n1) The game feels rushed and unfinished. For example, the appearance of some unit models doesn't fit with their final game-play implementation e.g. coalition support cruises, which function as armoured mobile resource drop of points for collectors and repair bays for all vehicles, have a large gaping whole in them where presumably collectors were supposed to dock and off-load their resources and/or where vehicles could dock for repairs. Instead resources just magically transfer from collectors to support cruises or the main carrier when the collector gets within a set range, this is similar to the coalition repairing mechanism; instead of docking, your vehicles are healed by magic beams when they are within a set range of a repair vehicle such as the support cruiser. I can understand why the developers might have changed the game-play mechanisms at a late stage; maybe they ran out of time, or it was too difficult to implement them properly, or they were causing problems/balance issues, but if so they should at least alter/re-designed the appearance of the units affected to fit with the new game-play mechanics, not doing so is just lazy.\nInterceptors/strike fighters for all intensive purposes play like bombers even though both factions also have dedicated bomber units as well. Each interceptor (Gaalsien) or strike fighter (Coalition) carries a single "missile" which it can only fire at ground targets so its essentially a small guided bomb, they do not have any other weapons and so can NOT attack other air units. I assume from their names "interceptor" and "fighter" they were originally intended to be primarily air to air fighters and likely a hard counter to bombers and gunships, instead they just work like bombers and are arguable better at bombing than the actual bombers themselves and neither faction has any aircraft capable of fighting other aircraft which just seems silly.\nIf you order a redundant unit to be decommissioned/recycled/retired and get back a fraction of the resources used to make it, instead of returning into the carrier through the entrance (in an opposite manner to if you had just made the unit), as you would expect, the unit just clips through to the centre of the carrier from any point on the surface of the carrier which just looks stupid and breaks any immersion.\n\n2) Why can I not dock my units!? An integral and incredibly useful feature of the homeworld games was the ability to dock smaller ships with your capital ship(s). With Deserts of Kharak this feature is no more, not even the smallest of vehicles such as resource collectors can be docked. Why this feature was not included is beyond me, it would have been so useful to have been able to dock units like resource collectors and small light vehicles, to protect them during attacks such as air strikes, instead you have to micro babysit them to keep them alive, which becomes a chore and general pain in the ♥♥♥. The only units that are capable of docking with the capital carrier are the aircraft, and this is only because of the way aircraft work in the game.\n\n3) The campaign is ridiculously easy (including the "hardest" setting) and showcases a very special A.I. You can quite easily burn through all the missions in quick succession on the "hardest" difficulty (classic) without a challenge; it is also relatively easy to get through the whole campaign, on classic, without loosing a single unit, albeit at a slower pace. One issue is that the computer players, both enemies and allies in the campaign, rely almost exclusively on scripted build routines, scripted patrols and scripted attacks; they have no need for resources and can see the whole map. To be fair the AI was similar in homeworld 1+2 but that is no excuse for not improving it.\n\n4) The game feels like a downgrade from Homeworld 1+2. I understand that Deserts of Kharak is suposed to be a different game, with different features and setting (on a planet/2D as opposed to in space/3D), but the developers have deliberately made the game-play extremely similar to the previous homeworld games (which is not a bad thing) so the is no logical reason not to keep in things like the ability to dock smaller vehicles which would have been an extremely useful feature as well as adding to immersion. In actual fact this game is identical gameplay wise to the original homeworld games but missing features and depth (literally); it adds nothing which is a huge shame because I feel that this game could of been very good.\nThe campaign is very short (as with other homeworld games) and the story is ok but not great and feels fairly bland, I also get the impression that the lead up to the ending was rushed. I've come to expect and accept very generic/bland story's from games in general but because of this games predecessors I expected a bit more.\n\nThe majority of my issues with the game could have fairly easily of been remedied with patches after launch but the developers instead thought it would be a "better" idea to re-skin a faction and sell it as DLC ><\nLike I have mentioned the game is not bad as such and it does have some good points, which I will now list. It looks pretty, runs relatively smoothly with only a few bugs (that I have noticed), random radio chatter (good for immersion), units are reasonably scaled.\n\nIn conclusion, currently I do not recommend this game. if you have not played homeworld 1+2, buy the remastered edition of them, it is cheaper, and you get 2 games, both of which are better than this one. If you have already played homeworld 1+2 and want to play this game, I would still not recommend it, its far better to replay homeworld 1+2 and just read the plot of Deserts of Kharak on-line if you want to know the story. If you just want to play a new RTS then keep looking, the have been a few good and a lot of rubbish RTS games released recently. Personally I found Act of Aggression to be surprisingly enjoyable but I know a lot of people do not like it.","April 16","false","30.7"," 2 of 5 people (40%) found this review helpful","40","2","5","0","0"

Ignore all those negative reviews, just a bunch of spoiled gamers who only want to play a game they designed in their imagination (but that is just not how it works). I only just met with the Homeland Series and I must say I am really impressed! I love the fact that every unit you create counts, especially in the Campaign, as they gain veterancy and every unit and CU/RU get transfered to the next mission. This veterancy system becomes more and more important as the missions progress, and trust me, you will want high ranking units further in the game! The same goes for Skirmish mode, there is no unit spamming due to the fact that you have to micro manage you resources and research, as well as veterancy. An elite unit will always over power a lower ranked unit. Regardless off what many reviewers on here say about infantry, I also love the fact that it is vehicle combar only, as infantry would be useless due to the massive sizes of the vehicles, (just look at some of the cut-scene's, Rachel sitting under the Science Runner, or when the Runner enters the Epsilon base) so infantry would make no sense .. I agree on the fact that there are not a lot of skirmish maps at the moment but, come on, the game just launched I am sure they will add more in the future! As for NO Base Building, I do not care too much for that. I love the fact that you command a huge carrier which is your mobile FOB and you have to protect it all costs. People also complained that there was not enough advertising before the launch, but I can understand and even prefer that, as too many games over advertise their games and end up with just a lot of fuss .. I can recommend this game to everyone who has missed a proper RTS game (as it is a dying breed), I am really happy to be able to play a new type of RTS without unit spamming. The only thing that does bug me a little is the unit limit, a max fleet of 125 (vehicles can take up to 8 units at once) so that is another point that needs working on (I think it is like that for performance). As for the rest, I think we will some major balance and content updates in the near future and I cannot wait to see them.","January 22","true","39.8"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Delivers a very tightly focused and engaging, albeit short, campaign. Easy and intuitive controls that are the staple of Homeworld games, and the devs really hit the mark on getting the feel right.

Some minor optimization issues during cutscenes on ultra (i7 gen3 and nvidia 750ti) but overall smooth gameplay at high resolution. Played through on medium difficulty with only a minor challenge, no palm sweating like Tenhauser on the original and didn't have to restart the entire campaign because of an improper build. If you're looking for a devastating challenge this might not be for you(at least on medium difficulty), but if you loved Homeworld this is definitely worth your time.

I think this sort of tactic should be reserved for the classic difficulty, or add another mid boss type enemy that'll chase you down, but maybe save a final objective for when the player wishes to end it, for easy and / or normal difficulty anyhoo.\n\nAgain my complaint is when the final objective that will end a map happens to be a boss type character that is chasing the Kapisi down, forcing an early end of a map, I don't mind if the enemy is throwing other groups of enemies or challenges at the kapisi, I just don't like having the map end so fast because the final objective is chasing the kapisi, this just shortens the game overall, I'm sure I would've gleefully enjoyed a few more hours recovering any and all artifacts and resources on each of the maps, and my overall playtime would've been closer to 15 ~ 20 hrs at least, and I would've been happier for it.\n\nThe impatient players can always go force that final fight themselves, if they REALLY want to, what I liked about Homeworld was being able to strategize how I would win.\n\nAs for the ending, yes all of us who played homeworld know what will be found deep in the great banded desert, BUT it would be nice to add more of that lore and story, I don't even remember seeing the galactic map etched on stone being found in 'Deserts of Kharak'.\n\nI mean sure, you see that in Homeworld proper in the intro, but that intro summarizes what happened after, told in the future.  I would have loved to see the S'jets exposition the discovery, maybe even discussion between the people who worked the expedition react, posit theory etc.  and then at least have a 5 minute + exposition about the next 100+ years:  The tribes again becoming the Kuushan, the world embracing unity and discovery, the design and building of the Great Mothership.\n\nHopefully some decently priced DLC could cover this?  The greatest moving aspect of this franchise is the story, don't give it too short a shrift.  ;)\n\nSome other minor complaints I have include Rachel's Hack ability, why does it require RUs to use it? Why aren't hacked units special abilities researchable to add to your own units?\n\nAlso why does Rachel habitually drive in front of the Kapisi if she is assigned to it?  shouldn't as a support unit naturally stay to the rear of the Kapisi?\n\nWhy do direct fire units (like the railgun units) not get their shots eclipsed by terrain?  I'm pretty sure they shouldn't be able to shoot through hills / dunes accurately with ZERO line of sight.","January 22","true","11.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And while I'm not that happy that it did play on ground this time I still very much enjoyed it.\n\nBlack Bird Interactive tried to remain loyal to the original art and style which goes from the epic cutscenes including the famous cinema borders + sound to the level of cutscenes while slightly enhanced nowadays you certainly know that this is a Homeworld game so fans of the old series might feel at home right away just in regards of the style.\n\nStory: Well there isn't much to tell and I don't want to say much about it but it is a prequel to Homeworld 1 in which you rediscover your origin of your people. While few plot holes and unanswered questions remain the story was well executed and does flow charmingly into the franchise.\n\nGameplay: The game arrives with a decent tech tree and alot of discovery awaits. How ever I felt that the (SP) Missions were somewhat to easy and also to repetiive compared to the masterpieces of the original Homeworld games.\n\nAs for the factions both of em seem rather balanced and are mostly copying each other. Their animations and looks differ but that's all I could tell during the playthrough of the campaign. (on medium by the way) But that doesn't necessarily make it bad in either way.\n\nTerrain also plays a significant role in this game as the line of sight and hight matters which adds some sort of strategic benefit similar to the Ground Control games. Also long range units are of certain importance as well. Because they can mean the difference between defeat and victory. If you're getting caught off guard an enemy air raid might eradicate your ground forces kinda fast if there's no AA nearby. Same goes for Artillery if you lack your own long range units or other counters you might be in for a rough ride. Conclusion it's a fun and rather balanced game with several strategic possibilities.\n\nMp:\nThere isn't much to tell yet as the mp section of the game is very tiny to this point. There're like 5,6 maps total which is kinda sad although I suspect more might follow. The game modi are also limited to (team)deathmatch and artifact recovery which is somewhat similar to capture the flag or king of the hill gaming modes except that you need to deliver the artifacts to a certain drop off point just like in CTF.\n\nMost maps are very small which adds a certain tension throughout the match though at the same time I also find it limiting as it doesn't allow you much room to flank your opponents. Also pity that they didn't add in some of their weather effects of the single player missions (Sand storms, Tornados) to the mp maps as that might have added in some additional spice to the mp game sector.\n\nPro:\n-Lovely story.\n-Balanced game\n-Good audio components\n-Nice graphics\n-Good performance on a 3 year old Quad Core I5.\n\nContra:\n-Tiny and limited mp section\n-Small sp campaign with somewhat repetitive mission design "Salvage this, destroy that" kind of thing.\n- Few plot holes and unanswered questions remained in the story arc (Taiidan? And why did it crash? 1st expedition? What happened to the remaining crew of certain Characters ship?)\n-Can't modify the controls (yet)\n(-What do they eat? Not a single plant nor animal seen throughout the game. I know it's a desert planet but at least some alien cactus here and there wont hurt.) Getting answered more closely in the Survival Guide.\n\n\nAll in all I can recommend it. Though I would possibly wait till a steam sale. It's good but it's not that good to pay 50 bucks for. Simply because it's a rather small game at this point. If you're a hardcore Homeworld fan though, then yes "Get it right away". :P","January 22","true","10.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Im not good with the lore of the series so I don't know how well of a prequel this is. There isn't much difference in units but it is enough to see different strategies between the factions. Multiplayer is a blast when you arent getting dsync.  I haven't seen any gamebreaking bugs. The only bug i have seen is the physics of unit animations bouncing around at times but it doesnt hurt the gameplay. Overall i really enjoy this game. If your an rts fan you'll love this game.\n\nI would write about the absolutely amazing unit feedback audio, but i think rock paper shotgun said it best:\n\n"The stand-out element, however, is the sound design. Over long years, we’ve miserably adjusted to the idea that all you can do with unit chatter is have each guy say something funny or militaryesque when you click on them, but Kharak casually rewrites the rules. Either by selecting units or by just hanging around and listening, you’ll hear the units talk amongst themselves. Select a unit and while sometimes they’ll just give an ‘acknowledged’, other times a more involved, context-sensitive reaction to whatever you’ve ordered them to do. An endangered unit might thank you for sending in air support. A ship which has spotted incoming enemies will tell you what type of craft they are. Idle units will chatter amongst themselves at length about faults and tactics. As well as successfully giving you a general sense of what’s going via audio alone, it sounds natural and responsive, rather than mechanical and repetitive – all adding to that sense that this is a large and well-oiled military machine, not just some cute little guys who popped out of a magic factory. Kharak might not otherwise be a landmark moment for the genre, but its unit audio does set new standards. It’s going to be so disappointing to play a strategy game filled with tinned quips after this."\n(Alec Meer, 2016, https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/01/21/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak-review/ )","January 22","true","33.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Sadly I only played Homeworld 2 and didn't get to play the Homeworld 1 until the recent "remastered" edition came to steam.  With that said, I also enjoy playing games like Supreme Commander, Total War series, Distant World, etc.  A lot of 4x games and strategy games.  So when I saw this game about to be released five days ago (15 January 2016), I thought it would be interesting to get the game and follow the lore which I have enjoyed.  When I finally got to play the game, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nAs a standard RTS, there is resource gathering. but no base management.  Everything is mobile, just like Homeworld's motherships.  The UI is well structured and easy to navigate, those who say otherwise simply have not used control groups before.  With that said, Ctrl commands is something new to me.  It allows you to order selected units to target a selected enemy group through selection and pursue until all units of this selected group (designated by you) is destroyed, or you issue another order.\nDepending on how you play, you might spend most of the match building up your force for a single and final confrontation, I will address this in detail at the combat section.\n\n\nCombat: 10/10\n(Unit Types)\nI will start with unit types.  The diversity in units between the two nations is moderately diverse, with one nation being more superior than the other on a few aspects.  However, the two nations generally have the same units that fulfill the same roles.  With that said, every single unit is different, since Gaalsian uses hover technology, while Coalition uses treads.  It was designed so that each nation will have more specialized units for a certain task.\n\n(Tactics/Strategy)\nWith the limited number of units (10 + 3 air craft), it would be common for commanders to approach each other with similar forces.  However, because of this, there is not a single unit in the game that is useless.  Just because I can create battlecruisers, doesn't mean I will stop making the first unit.  Each unit fulfills its role adamantly.  The Carrier is also very combat efficient, so its not like a damsel in distress.  Terrain advantages and choke points can be utilized to maximum effectiveness.  If you are pressed, there is always a way out.  Enemy is harassing you with air?  Get missiles.  Raiding you with light vehicles?  Get armored vehicles to defend.  Their rails are destroying your armored vehicles?  Send your light vehicles in.\n\n(Aesthetics)\nThis game is beautiful.  The battles are awesome to watch and very fluid.  The environment is very well crafted and actually plays a part in combat.  Sometimes it can actually be more important to secure a strategic position rather than resources.  Combat damages and wrecks remain for the remainder of the match as a "trophy" of the battlefield.  The explosions are gratifying, especially when you timed it perfectly to wreck havoc on the enemy.  Resulting a decisive victory.\n\nSound/Music: 10/10\nThe music is nice, and plays well as ambience.  The unit chatter is as needed and is not annoying.  The constant notifications received from these chatter is actually helpful and if you prefer listening to music rather than unit chatter then you might miss out on some vital information.  Every now and then, you will hear additional chatter between two radio lines and its interesting to listen on to their conversations.\n\nReplayability: 6/10\nRight now it only has 5 multiplayer maps.  However, the battles are always exhilirating.  The campaign is good, but also good for one play only.  So replayability right now is low for campaign, but moderate for multiplayer.  So please get this game and join the fun!\n\nAlso, I have not encountered a single bug and plays very well at max.\ni7-4790 3.6 ghz Quad\n2x GTX 970\n16 GB ram\nSSD\n\n46/50 or 92% rating from me!

If you are a Homeworld vet, as I am, you may find the 'normal' difficulty level to be a bit too easy. But perhaps hard is called 'Classic' for a reason... I thoroughly enjoyed the game and would recommend it wholeheartedly to any RTS fan in general, but especially to any Homeworld fans out there that may be holding back.

Much nostalgia.  Missions are fast and furious, so if you're expecting a slow easy pace like Starcraft 2's campaign, you will be disappointed.  Air units are pretty strong, and mistakes are pretty punishing.\n\nThe game, like the remastered version of Homeworld 2, does not allow you to manually progress to the next mission.  This results in many lost minerals and artifacts if you progress on the main objectives at a fast pace.  The end result is that you start the next mission without the resources required to get off to a decent start.  This can be VERY frustrating!\n\nOnly other complaint is that most of the strike units are pretty boring.  Gone are the Ion Frigates, support corvettes, and other smaller units that made their mark on the homeworld franchise.  Instead, it's a bunch of trucks that all sort of seem to do the same thing, or very close to it.  The game is very heavily focused around fighter and corvette equivalent class vessels, and more than halfway through the story, I can't build anything bigger yet.  Makes for some frustrating gameplay, especially considering how flimsy those vehicles are and how impossible that makes maintaining veteran units.\n\nI'll update this review when I finish my playthrough, but for right now, I'm giving this a recommend based 90% on the fact that it's Homeworld and 10% on the quality of the game itself.\n\n","January 21","true","12.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Me and my bro used to play these games all the time even though I was too young to understand the story at the time, eventual re-runs solved that as I got older.\n\nIn my opinion, the story is the best part in the HW series, and is the overall contribution to the positive review.  There are some minor things that could have been improved on but I believe HW: DK holds true to the previous games as being story rich.\n\nMy only real disappointment was after the first mission when the stats of the fleet showed up and it showed the water and fuel levels.  I was really hoping for there to be some side missions where you had to re-supply and half-way hoping that the units in the game had a fuel meter that had to be managed or risk leaving a craft a sitting duck while waiting for fuel rats.  I know it kinda sounds like a pain but this would have had a moderate impact on how the game would have been played, as the last thing any sane person would have done was attack an excavation site running on fumes and it would have added a great deal to the desperate mood of the game.\n\nNow, I was reading through some of the other reviews and I have to admit, the graphics, camera controls, and unit diversity was a bit subpar.  Although I am more concerned about the camera controls than the graphics.  It was sometimes very difficult to get a good view of what was going on around you but popping into the strategy view helps with that at the loss of viewing the actual crafts.  I think that the ships could have been more detailed upon closer inspection and some of the in-mission cutscenes really pointed this out.\n\nFinally the unit diversity, which was pretty small, but in my honest opinion, was a good choice to go with as the story line revolves around a fleet with limited supplies (again, not as stressed as I was hoping it to be) going from point A to point B fighting enemies along the way.  Having multipurpose crafts such as the Baserunner would have been the economical choice.  Also I can't think of any other way to diversify the fleet that wouldn't have to have been re-discovered in HW1, such as beam weapons and the like.  Would be kind of silly to have a beam weapon craft in HW: DK and then play HW1 and have to buy Beam Tech from the Bentusi in order to build one :S\n\nI have yet to play MP, but I looked at it briefly and noticed there are very few maps.  I fear that DLC will add more maps and content for the price of 30 dollars...","January 21","true","12.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Here, it mostly feels like a plot designed purely to shove you into the combat in a way consistent with established lore - it's not until most of the way through the campaign that it starts to feel like more than a perfunctory/excuse plot and starts explaining its own internal logic.  By the end though, it does feel like a Homeworld game in tone, if not in length or depth.  The lore seems to mostly follow Homeworld 2, while the gameplay more draws from Homeworld 1.\n\nThe campaign seems a bit on the easy side.  For much of the campaign, the unit mix is relatively modern (ie small set of rock-paper-scissors units) - the unit diversity only comes in rather late, which is unfortunate, since the late missions are often much *shorter* since you have such a strong, veteran force (and numerous tools & utilities) by then.  Air units are treated more like special attacks than units, and are incredibly powerful, seeming to negate much of the potential difficulty.  The brevity means much of compounding economic decisions Homeworld usually has you make are vastly milder here.  It's like the game is filled with Homeworld's great macro-mechanics, but the campaign fails to utilize them well.\n\nThe brevity of the campaign is unfortunate, and makes it a questionable purchase at full launch price if that's your main interest.  But the quality means that if you can get over the lack of content by one means or another, Shipbreakers Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak is a solid offering.  Certainly the best RTS I've encountered in many years.","January 22","true","15.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/spycho/recommended/281610/","spycho","Spycho","http://steamcommunity.com/id/spycho/","175 products in account","First off I have always loved the homeworld series. Played them since they came out when i was a kid. And, i think this game and its background story as told in the expadition guide are incredible and i want more. There is a serious feel and connection to the old homeworld games that is distict. Ground Homeworld I feel is an AMAZING idea which needs to be repeated. That being said, there are many points about this game i like...\n\nPros\n- Guard Command in this game is one of the most useful tools in this game. Allowing automatic battlegrounds that work really well.\n- The line of sight tool in this game works very well and that combined with the move command allows for simple and intresting game play\n- LAND CARRIERS HOW FREAKING COOL IS THAT!!!\n- Units look like they should work in real life and i havent noticed any clipping in the models themselves\n- The Battle Chatter is AMAZING!\n- Music is PERFECT. Its something thats many times over looked but it sets the scene and this games music does it well.\n- The Deserts themselves are very well done. The rolling dunes look real and the desert walls look so realistic.\n- Vehicles move very well as far as ive noticed.\n- waypoint setting is very intuitive\n- Once again if you read the expedition guide you find the story is SOOO rich its incredible. Very much worth touching on again\n\nThere are however a few big things that i dont like\n\nCons -\n- TEXTURES ARE HORRIBLE and ill tell you why... if this where any other game id say what ever its an RTS. However this game is trying to focus on massive scales (not to mention being a series which always pushed the bounderies of graphics potential). As i play this game i find it very hard to realize the sence of scale because when i zoom as close as i can get to get a good scenic view the SAND LOOKS FUZZY AND UNDEFINED. This combined with the vehicles own textures being rather blurry results in making all the units look smaller.\n\n- SCALE COMPARISIONS are few and far between. with the sand and units hull detail lacking there is not much else to help you visualize the true scale being represented by the units under your command. Id like to see more human sized representations if not in some cases humans standing on the units walkways.\n\n- Terrain Shadows are not crisp even on Ultra which also separates me from the world immersion.\n\n- Weapons Fire seems very random. It would seem the units movement across the dunes means nothing. They could hit the target while on the move or miss by a mile while standing still. If your trying to sell the units as having future tech I don't see how you could miss by as much as some of these units do while they aren't moving.\n\n- Both teams units are basically the same exact things. As Ive heard it put so well, one teams units hover the other teams dont. Other then that they might as well be the same thing. Gotta switch it up. Every good RTS game ive ever played has done something to make the two teams really stand apart. Ground Control 2, all C&C games, War Craft and Star Craft are all examples of this. Also, all Total War games inately have this as well (because they seek to emulate real life)\n\nAll and all dispite my gripes, I really like what this game is trying to do and its original concepts and story are fresh and inovative. I dont nessisarally think this game recaptures what i felt when i played homeworld & homeworld 2 for the first time as a kid. However, although i may not find it to be the best made Homeworld game its still a good game if your just looking to play a game. I think maybe if they kept up on this path and didnt abandon it this titles predesessors will be truely amazing. For that reason i have to vote this game up.","January 22","true","13.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Guiding your carrier and continually growing fleet of units through the great deserts of Kharak really brought me back to the days of playing Homeworld. The campaign is done well, with great cut scenes connecting missions together in manner that tells an interesting story. Each mission is varied, much better than the usual "destroy all enemies" type missions other RTS games can suffer from. I've completed the campaign on normal in 11ish hours and now I'm going back in to do it all again on classic level. I've played a few skirmish games and found them fun, but they move a little fast for me. For that reason I'll probably be skipping multiplayer. That being said, I found great value in the campaign, making the game well worth my purchase. I think Homeworld is in good hands with Blackbird Interactive. I look forward to seeing what they and Gearbox can offer us next in the Homeworld universe.","January 31","true","15.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cwsteam/recommended/281610/","cwsteam","Capt Kill Original","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cwsteam/","104 products in account","Before DoK, I knew nothing of the Homeworld franchise.  The only reason I bought this was because it reminded me of Dune II all those years ago.  The pre-order came with Homeworld 1 & 2 remastered editions.  Knowing nothing of Homeworld, I played through those campaigns before starting the DoK prequel.  Solid and fun campaigns, reminded me of Battlestar Galactica.  Open space combat kind of felt like a giant submarine battle.  Interesting twist on RTS.  Remastered multiplayer could be fun but I prefer the polished balance of SC2 for competitive play.  I feared DoK would be a C&C4 abomination with the mobile carrier/construction yard.  It was not an abomination, it was excellent, a modern Dune II without the spice.  DoK has been widely criticized for multiplayer balance issues, a general lack of content, and easy campaign upgrades.  The balance is fine, I can win with either faction on all difficulty settings on skirmish mode.  Content is solid, but I did get 3 games for the price of one.  If you think the campaign is too easy then raise the difficulty and you won't have the resources to upgrade everything until maybe the later missions if you managed to keep your persistent fleet alive.  I enjoyed fleet persistence between missions on all 3 games.  The stories amount to a short comic book per game with little character development, and that's ok, it's still on par with or superior to most offerings.  DoK multiplayer could use some more maps, but there's plenty to get started with.  Now that the campaigns are done I might keep DoK installed to challenge my brothers on multiplayer when the price comes down.  I used the Steam Controller for all 3 campaigns.  Community templates get you started, might take an hour or two to customize for yourself.  After this I think the Steam Controller might improve my SC2 APM's.  If anymore DoK DLC comes out I'll probably play it too.","February 5","true","38.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

A brilliant addidtion to the lore of the series, and really  feels like an authentic homeworld game despite it being ground based. As much as i loved it however, the game is not without a few drawbacks:\n\nThe game is requiring some balance changes. Larger units/ air units absolutley stop all other types in the game.\nIt is also missing any sort of formation option, which was in the original games and is sorely missed.

The series that continued to inspire my childhood for years from homeworld to cataclysm to homeworld 2 is back in a really big way. It leaves you wanting more, which is something few games can do any more. These guys are still the masters of RTS and they make games because they love them. Rob Cunningham et al. are artists who deliver an experience that will leave its imprints on your mind for all time. Every homeworld game is a gem.

Needs more maps for multiplayer and a more consistent AI.\n\nFirst off, this game is fantastically well polished in the fundamental aspects.  With the other homeworlds I often felt there were lots of features and ships and upgrades that weren't pertinent to any viable strategy.  I think the goal was to make sure that all the content created and implimented was meant to be pertinent to the player.  I found myself using every single unit and almost all of their abilities.  I think they did a fantastic job with making this an in between 3D space RTS and 2D traditional RPS with the implementation of dunes.\n\nWhat is being said about the lack of content is somewhat true.  The story was rich and was easy to get into; an all around good time that didn't drag on forever.  Others might be looking for longer stories but I felt like it was appropriately measured for a prologue.  The number of maps is pretty depressing and I did notice that if a battle waged on for too long eventually the AI would kind of just stop pressing the offensive and turtle.\n\nThe assymettric factions are well put together with similiar units but put together in a way that requires different play styles.  There was perhaps room for a 3rd faction (the sakala really should have had a different design) but I wouldn't be surprised if all this was intended to be hand in somekind of DLC.","February 16","true","26.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This was desperate cut throat gameplay, intense pressured missions.\n\nIt has all the vibe of the HW1/2 the cutscenes are great the storyline was enjoyable but could have been expanded on a little (Id but any potential SP DLC for that allone)\n\nThe units are few but the value of those units, especially when you carry them through each mission never using the default fleet mode. The pain of losing that honourguard at the end he was with me from so early on.\n\nIts risk vs reward especially in the later missions. I loved it im glad they put a fully working game out with an intense singleplayer campain instead of padding it out and ruining the pacing.\n\nI do hope for more DLC and for (fingers crossed) homeworld 3.\n\nI think if you are a fan of the series it is a must, if you are a casual gamer id be on the fence.

It has good fastpaced RTS combat. I really do like the combat, the carrier actually feels a good platform for combat and is not only meant for production like in the other HW games. If you don't take HW Complex mods into account. Campaign and lore is up to the legacy of homeworld games.\n\nFor this "review", I would give it a side thumb if I could. For now I will give it a thumbs down once they fix the issues below.\n\nPrimary things that really made me do a refund:\n- Only a very few multiplayer maps. I mean it.\n- You cannot rebind hotkeys. Using arrow keys for map movement instead of WASD isn't optimal. In Wargame: Red Dragon WASD map movement is a must for me.\n- Region lock in multiplayer. This way you will kill the multiplayer.\n\nI will consider getting this game in the future, once it's at the 20 euro price tag and when they actually patch the game to the state where it should've been at the release. Gearbox Software doing the rushed releases as always.","January 24","false","1.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game feels just like rock paper scissors mostly.\n\nalso the interface needs some polish.. the way you navigate to your units to build is so annoying. and the fact you cant face a group of units in a direction, and cant keep them in formation is really annoying. the camera cant be zoomed out enough either, i just land up playing in the tactical map mode mostly, so dont even get to see the graphics most of the time. Also havent played multiplayer yet, but ive noticed in skirmish you cant save replays... in this day and age this is an attrocity.\n\nAs a homeworld fan im a bit dissapointed with this one. try again with homeworld 3\n\ncampaign was alright though, bit short","January 25","false","11.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

No complaints.\nUI - Mediochre. Needs work.\n\nGameplay - Fail.\n\n\nSo here's how every mission will go.\n\nThe game will most likely drop you into a senario where you have about 5 seconds to react and setup your forces before you start getting pounded or have to go meet some timed objective. Oh and remember, there's NO PAUSE feature so forget about doing any planning or strategy. You will then proceed to move into a defensive formation around your carrier. That is pretty much the last you will move your ground forces for the remainder of mission (with the exception of maybe sending out scavs). They will just sit there turtled and defending.\n\nWhy? Well a number of reasons.\n\nComputer has infinite resourses and units. You do not. sending out your units is pointless since even if they win a skirmish, the enemy will get new units in 5 seconds for free. Eventually you will lose all your units and will have accomplished little to nothing. Ground forces are just defensive turrets for your carrier.\n\nAlso the game does not allow a high enough unit cound to field and offensive and a defensive team. If you use your units on offense, your carrier will be undefended.\nThe only real offensive units are your aircraft. They will do ALL the work and they will do it better and more efficiently than any of your ground units.\n\nAnother thing....your units in this game are WAY too fragile. It's absolutely stuipid how fast units die.\n\n\nAnother downside to the game is mission design. Whoever was in charge of this, you really need to go back to flipping burgers.\n\nAlmost every mission is exactly the same. They pretend to be different, but in the end I played almost every mission exactly the same, had the same triggers, had the same outcomes.\n\nOnly variety to this was when the game would randomly take units away from you for ....reasons.\nMy favorite occurance of this being when you carrier arrives to a misson BEFORE all you other units/crusiers/etc. Um ok, your carrier, which is basically the slowest, lumbering beast in your entire task force, by some miracle, managed to arrive at the combat site a full half day before all these other units which are faster.\n\nSure makes perfect sense.\n\n\nAnother gripe...\n\nResearch.\n\nSo for the first handful of missions you get to research a few things at a time. Than at one point in the game you suddenly get like 50 things to research (basically all of the tech left in the game). Even though you are really only about half way through the game.\n\nThere's a veterancy system in the game but good luck with that. I acutally went through the trouble to farm units for a LONG time to build up veterancy in many of my forces. Only to have these forces instantly obliterated later by...oh any host of things. It doesn't matter. Your units pretty much die if anything larger than a gnat hits them.\n\n\nFor a game that claims to be an RTS, it is by far the worst RTS I've played in a LONG time.\n\nBut quite frankly, it's really not an RTS.\n\nSo there's my rant. Sorry if it's a bit random but I tend to just spew thoughts.","February 1","false","29.6"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","1","3","0","0"

I think this sort of tactic should be reserved for the classic difficulty, or add another mid boss type enemy that'll chase you down, but maybe save a final objective for when the player wishes to end it, for easy and / or normal difficulty anyhoo.\n\nAgain my complaint is when the final objective that will end a map happens to be a boss type character that is chasing the Kapisi down, forcing an early end of a map, I don't mind if the enemy is throwing other groups of enemies or challenges at the kapisi, I just don't like having the map end so fast because the final objective is chasing the kapisi, this just shortens the game overall, I'm sure I would've gleefully enjoyed a few more hours recovering any and all artifacts and resources on each of the maps, and my overall playtime would've been closer to 15 ~ 20 hrs at least, and I would've been happier for it.\n\nThe impatient players can always go force that final fight themselves, if they REALLY want to, what I liked about Homeworld was being able to strategize how I would win.\n\nAs for the ending, yes all of us who played homeworld know what will be found deep in the great banded desert, BUT it would be nice to add more of that lore and story, I don't even remember seeing the galactic map etched on stone being found in 'Deserts of Kharak'.\n\nI mean sure, you see that in Homeworld proper in the intro, but that intro summarizes what happened after, told in the future.  I would have loved to see the S'jets exposition the discovery, maybe even discussion between the people who worked the expedition react, posit theory etc.  and then at least have a 5 minute + exposition about the next 100+ years:  The tribes again becoming the Kuushan, the world embracing unity and discovery, the design and building of the Great Mothership.\n\nHopefully some decently priced DLC could cover this?  The greatest moving aspect of this franchise is the story, don't give it too short a shrift.  ;)\n\nSome other minor complaints I have include Rachel's Hack ability, why does it require RUs to use it? Why aren't hacked units special abilities researchable to add to your own units?\n\nAlso why does Rachel habitually drive in front of the Kapisi if she is assigned to it?  shouldn't as a support unit naturally stay to the rear of the Kapisi?\n\nWhy do direct fire units (like the railgun units) not get their shots eclipsed by terrain?  I'm pretty sure they shouldn't be able to shoot through hills / dunes accurately with ZERO line of sight.","January 22","true","11.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

And while I'm not that happy that it did play on ground this time I still very much enjoyed it.\n\nBlack Bird Interactive tried to remain loyal to the original art and style which goes from the epic cutscenes including the famous cinema borders + sound to the level of cutscenes while slightly enhanced nowadays you certainly know that this is a Homeworld game so fans of the old series might feel at home right away just in regards of the style.\n\nStory: Well there isn't much to tell and I don't want to say much about it but it is a prequel to Homeworld 1 in which you rediscover your origin of your people. While few plot holes and unanswered questions remain the story was well executed and does flow charmingly into the franchise.\n\nGameplay: The game arrives with a decent tech tree and alot of discovery awaits. How ever I felt that the (SP) Missions were somewhat to easy and also to repetiive compared to the masterpieces of the original Homeworld games.\n\nAs for the factions both of em seem rather balanced and are mostly copying each other. Their animations and looks differ but that's all I could tell during the playthrough of the campaign. (on medium by the way) But that doesn't necessarily make it bad in either way.\n\nTerrain also plays a significant role in this game as the line of sight and hight matters which adds some sort of strategic benefit similar to the Ground Control games. Also long range units are of certain importance as well. Because they can mean the difference between defeat and victory. If you're getting caught off guard an enemy air raid might eradicate your ground forces kinda fast if there's no AA nearby. Same goes for Artillery if you lack your own long range units or other counters you might be in for a rough ride. Conclusion it's a fun and rather balanced game with several strategic possibilities.\n\nMp:\nThere isn't much to tell yet as the mp section of the game is very tiny to this point. There're like 5,6 maps total which is kinda sad although I suspect more might follow. The game modi are also limited to (team)deathmatch and artifact recovery which is somewhat similar to capture the flag or king of the hill gaming modes except that you need to deliver the artifacts to a certain drop off point just like in CTF.\n\nMost maps are very small which adds a certain tension throughout the match though at the same time I also find it limiting as it doesn't allow you much room to flank your opponents. Also pity that they didn't add in some of their weather effects of the single player missions (Sand storms, Tornados) to the mp maps as that might have added in some additional spice to the mp game sector.\n\nPro:\n-Lovely story.\n-Balanced game\n-Good audio components\n-Nice graphics\n-Good performance on a 3 year old Quad Core I5.\n\nContra:\n-Tiny and limited mp section\n-Small sp campaign with somewhat repetitive mission design "Salvage this, destroy that" kind of thing.\n- Few plot holes and unanswered questions remained in the story arc (Taiidan? And why did it crash? 1st expedition? What happened to the remaining crew of certain Characters ship?)\n-Can't modify the controls (yet)\n(-What do they eat? Not a single plant nor animal seen throughout the game. I know it's a desert planet but at least some alien cactus here and there wont hurt.) Getting answered more closely in the Survival Guide.\n\n\nAll in all I can recommend it. Though I would possibly wait till a steam sale. It's good but it's not that good to pay 50 bucks for. Simply because it's a rather small game at this point. If you're a hardcore Homeworld fan though, then yes "Get it right away". :P","January 22","true","10.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Im not good with the lore of the series so I don't know how well of a prequel this is. There isn't much difference in units but it is enough to see different strategies between the factions. Multiplayer is a blast when you arent getting dsync.  I haven't seen any gamebreaking bugs. The only bug i have seen is the physics of unit animations bouncing around at times but it doesnt hurt the gameplay. Overall i really enjoy this game. If your an rts fan you'll love this game.\n\nI would write about the absolutely amazing unit feedback audio, but i think rock paper shotgun said it best:\n\n"The stand-out element, however, is the sound design. Over long years, we’ve miserably adjusted to the idea that all you can do with unit chatter is have each guy say something funny or militaryesque when you click on them, but Kharak casually rewrites the rules. Either by selecting units or by just hanging around and listening, you’ll hear the units talk amongst themselves. Select a unit and while sometimes they’ll just give an ‘acknowledged’, other times a more involved, context-sensitive reaction to whatever you’ve ordered them to do. An endangered unit might thank you for sending in air support. A ship which has spotted incoming enemies will tell you what type of craft they are. Idle units will chatter amongst themselves at length about faults and tactics. As well as successfully giving you a general sense of what’s going via audio alone, it sounds natural and responsive, rather than mechanical and repetitive – all adding to that sense that this is a large and well-oiled military machine, not just some cute little guys who popped out of a magic factory. Kharak might not otherwise be a landmark moment for the genre, but its unit audio does set new standards. It’s going to be so disappointing to play a strategy game filled with tinned quips after this."\n(Alec Meer, 2016, https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/01/21/homeworld-deserts-of-kharak-review/ )","January 22","true","33.7"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Sadly I only played Homeworld 2 and didn't get to play the Homeworld 1 until the recent "remastered" edition came to steam.  With that said, I also enjoy playing games like Supreme Commander, Total War series, Distant World, etc.  A lot of 4x games and strategy games.  So when I saw this game about to be released five days ago (15 January 2016), I thought it would be interesting to get the game and follow the lore which I have enjoyed.  When I finally got to play the game, I was pleasantly surprised.\n\n\nGameplay: 10/10\nAs a standard RTS, there is resource gathering. but no base management.  Everything is mobile, just like Homeworld's motherships.  The UI is well structured and easy to navigate, those who say otherwise simply have not used control groups before.  With that said, Ctrl commands is something new to me.  It allows you to order selected units to target a selected enemy group through selection and pursue until all units of this selected group (designated by you) is destroyed, or you issue another order.\nDepending on how you play, you might spend most of the match building up your force for a single and final confrontation, I will address this in detail at the combat section.\n\n\nCombat: 10/10\n(Unit Types)\nI will start with unit types.  The diversity in units between the two nations is moderately diverse, with one nation being more superior than the other on a few aspects.  However, the two nations generally have the same units that fulfill the same roles.  With that said, every single unit is different, since Gaalsian uses hover technology, while Coalition uses treads.  It was designed so that each nation will have more specialized units for a certain task.\n\n(Tactics/Strategy)\nWith the limited number of units (10 + 3 air craft), it would be common for commanders to approach each other with similar forces.  However, because of this, there is not a single unit in the game that is useless.  Just because I can create battlecruisers, doesn't mean I will stop making the first unit.  Each unit fulfills its role adamantly.  The Carrier is also very combat efficient, so its not like a damsel in distress.  Terrain advantages and choke points can be utilized to maximum effectiveness.  If you are pressed, there is always a way out.  Enemy is harassing you with air?  Get missiles.  Raiding you with light vehicles?  Get armored vehicles to defend.  Their rails are destroying your armored vehicles?  Send your light vehicles in.\n\n(Aesthetics)\nThis game is beautiful.  The battles are awesome to watch and very fluid.  The environment is very well crafted and actually plays a part in combat.  Sometimes it can actually be more important to secure a strategic position rather than resources.  Combat damages and wrecks remain for the remainder of the match as a "trophy" of the battlefield.  The explosions are gratifying, especially when you timed it perfectly to wreck havoc on the enemy.  Resulting a decisive victory.\n\nSound/Music: 10/10\nThe music is nice, and plays well as ambience.  The unit chatter is as needed and is not annoying.  The constant notifications received from these chatter is actually helpful and if you prefer listening to music rather than unit chatter then you might miss out on some vital information.  Every now and then, you will hear additional chatter between two radio lines and its interesting to listen on to their conversations.\n\nReplayability: 6/10\nRight now it only has 5 multiplayer maps.  However, the battles are always exhilirating.  The campaign is good, but also good for one play only.  So replayability right now is low for campaign, but moderate for multiplayer.  So please get this game and join the fun!\n\nAlso, I have not encountered a single bug and plays very well at max.\ni7-4790 3.6 ghz Quad\n2x GTX 970\n16 GB ram\nSSD\n\n46/50 or 92% rating from me!

When I first heard of the concept of this game, I thought it was stupid, but the pre-release videos really sold me on it. The game definitely exudes that 'Homeworld Vibe' I've been missing since Homeworld 2 was released, and is a worthy purchase. If you are a Homeworld vet, as I am, you may find the 'normal' difficulty level to be a bit too easy. But perhaps hard is called 'Classic' for a reason... I thoroughly enjoyed the game and would recommend it wholeheartedly to any RTS fan in general, but especially to any Homeworld fans out there that may be holding back.

Resulting explosions were gratifying. 10/10\n\nOn a more serious note, I enjoy the games aesthetics and it's streamlined gameplay. Normally I'm a fan of RTS games such of the likes of Command & Conquer Red Alert 2 to call back to the days or the Total War games, but this is a great example of pairing down the RTS and still making it enjoyable. I'm able to be jump in and play a good game without having to invest several hours into it.\n\nDeserts of Kharak doesnt have to be a very big and complex title to be a good RTS.

Much nostalgia.  Missions are fast and furious, so if you're expecting a slow easy pace like Starcraft 2's campaign, you will be disappointed.  Air units are pretty strong, and mistakes are pretty punishing.\n\nThe game, like the remastered version of Homeworld 2, does not allow you to manually progress to the next mission.  This results in many lost minerals and artifacts if you progress on the main objectives at a fast pace.  The end result is that you start the next mission without the resources required to get off to a decent start.  This can be VERY frustrating!\n\nOnly other complaint is that most of the strike units are pretty boring.  Gone are the Ion Frigates, support corvettes, and other smaller units that made their mark on the homeworld franchise.  Instead, it's a bunch of trucks that all sort of seem to do the same thing, or very close to it.  The game is very heavily focused around fighter and corvette equivalent class vessels, and more than halfway through the story, I can't build anything bigger yet.  Makes for some frustrating gameplay, especially considering how flimsy those vehicles are and how impossible that makes maintaining veteran units.\n\nI'll update this review when I finish my playthrough, but for right now, I'm giving this a recommend based 90% on the fact that it's Homeworld and 10% on the quality of the game itself.\n\n","January 21","true","12.5"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

It's a RTS, but it's not in the same vein as the frenzied click-fest style of so many modern RTS's. For the most part, you have time to plan moves, co-ordinate attacks with ground and air assets, long range and repair craft all contributing towards a sucessful maneuver.\n\nThere are times when it does turn into a panic, and you have to move fast and click even faster, but that's not the norm, and I think it only serves to add tension to an otherwise slower paced RTS.\n\nSignificient tactical choices are few, but vital. For exmaple, some terrain will not allow the passage of your carrier, so do you leave it unguarded and send the rest of your units off, or split them, losing the punch?\n\nI haven't tried mlultiplayer yet, but I can imagine that is a bit more of a click-fest, but still not overwhelmingly so, due to the way the game works. I think that it will be played better on the tactical map for MP than in the close u p pretty view though, so you can keep an eye on what your opponent is up to.\n\nThe game looks and sounds very good indeed, and although that's not why you buy a strategy game, it does add a lot towards the value of it.\n\nOverall, I'd recommend this game as rewarding and fun to play, but not a serious challange, at least in SP mode.","January 22","true","28.4"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Guiding your carrier and continually growing fleet of units through the great deserts of Kharak really brought me back to the days of playing Homeworld. The campaign is done well, with great cut scenes connecting missions together in manner that tells an interesting story. Each mission is varied, much better than the usual "destroy all enemies" type missions other RTS games can suffer from. I've completed the campaign on normal in 11ish hours and now I'm going back in to do it all again on classic level. I've played a few skirmish games and found them fun, but they move a little fast for me. For that reason I'll probably be skipping multiplayer. That being said, I found great value in the campaign, making the game well worth my purchase. I think Homeworld is in good hands with Blackbird Interactive.

The only reason I bought this was because it reminded me of Dune II all those years ago.  The pre-order came with Homeworld 1 & 2 remastered editions.  Knowing nothing of Homeworld, I played through those campaigns before starting the DoK prequel.  Solid and fun campaigns, reminded me of Battlestar Galactica.  Open space combat kind of felt like a giant submarine battle.  Interesting twist on RTS.  Remastered multiplayer could be fun but I prefer the polished balance of SC2 for competitive play.  I feared DoK would be a C&C4 abomination with the mobile carrier/construction yard.  It was not an abomination, it was excellent, a modern Dune II without the spice.  DoK has been widely criticized for multiplayer balance issues, a general lack of content, and easy campaign upgrades.  The balance is fine, I can win with either faction on all difficulty settings on skirmish mode.  Content is solid, but I did get 3 games for the price of one.  If you think the campaign is too easy then raise the difficulty and you won't have the resources to upgrade everything until maybe the later missions if you managed to keep your persistent fleet alive.  I enjoyed fleet persistence between missions on all 3 games.  The stories amount to a short comic book per game with little character development, and that's ok, it's still on par with or superior to most offerings.  DoK multiplayer could use some more maps, but there's plenty to get started with.  Now that the campaigns are done I might keep DoK installed to challenge my brothers on multiplayer when the price comes down.  I used the Steam Controller for all 3 campaigns.  Community templates get you started, might take an hour or two to customize for yourself.  After this I think the Steam Controller might improve my SC2 APM's.  If anymore DoK DLC comes out I'll probably play it too.","February 5","true","38.0"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Needs more maps for multiplayer and a more consistent AI.\n\nFirst off, this game is fantastically well polished in the fundamental aspects.  With the other homeworlds I often felt there were lots of features and ships and upgrades that weren't pertinent to any viable strategy.  I think the goal was to make sure that all the content created and implimented was meant to be pertinent to the player.  I found myself using every single unit and almost all of their abilities.  I think they did a fantastic job with making this an in between 3D space RTS and 2D traditional RPS with the implementation of dunes.\n\nWhat is being said about the lack of content is somewhat true.  The story was rich and was easy to get into; an all around good time that didn't drag on forever.  Others might be looking for longer stories but I felt like it was appropriately measured for a prologue.  The number of maps is pretty depressing and I did notice that if a battle waged on for too long eventually the AI would kind of just stop pressing the offensive and turtle.\n\nThe assymettric factions are well put together with similiar units but put together in a way that requires different play styles.  There was perhaps room for a 3rd faction (the sakala really should have had a different design) but I wouldn't be surprised if all this was intended to be hand in somekind of DLC.","February 16","true","26.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Played them since they came out when i was a kid. And, i think this game and its background story as told in the expadition guide are incredible and i want more. There is a serious feel and connection to the old homeworld games that is distict. Ground Homeworld I feel is an AMAZING idea which needs to be repeated. That being said, there are many points about this game i like...\n\nPros\n- Guard Command in this game is one of the most useful tools in this game. Allowing automatic battlegrounds that work really well.\n- The line of sight tool in this game works very well and that combined with the move command allows for simple and intresting game play\n- LAND CARRIERS HOW FREAKING COOL IS THAT!!!\n- Units look like they should work in real life and i havent noticed any clipping in the models themselves\n- The Battle Chatter is AMAZING!\n- Music is PERFECT. Its something thats many times over looked but it sets the scene and this games music does it well.\n- The Deserts themselves are very well done. The rolling dunes look real and the desert walls look so realistic.\n- Vehicles move very well as far as ive noticed.\n- waypoint setting is very intuitive\n- Once again if you read the expedition guide you find the story is SOOO rich its incredible. Very much worth touching on again\n\nThere are however a few big things that i dont like\n\nCons -\n- TEXTURES ARE HORRIBLE and ill tell you why... if this where any other game id say what ever its an RTS. However this game is trying to focus on massive scales (not to mention being a series which always pushed the bounderies of graphics potential). As i play this game i find it very hard to realize the sence of scale because when i zoom as close as i can get to get a good scenic view the SAND LOOKS FUZZY AND UNDEFINED. This combined with the vehicles own textures being rather blurry results in making all the units look smaller.\n\n- SCALE COMPARISIONS are few and far between. with the sand and units hull detail lacking there is not much else to help you visualize the true scale being represented by the units under your command. Id like to see more human sized representations if not in some cases humans standing on the units walkways.\n\n- Terrain Shadows are not crisp even on Ultra which also separates me from the world immersion.\n\n- Weapons Fire seems very random. It would seem the units movement across the dunes means nothing. They could hit the target while on the move or miss by a mile while standing still. If your trying to sell the units as having future tech I don't see how you could miss by as much as some of these units do while they aren't moving.\n\n- Both teams units are basically the same exact things. As Ive heard it put so well, one teams units hover the other teams dont. Other then that they might as well be the same thing. Gotta switch it up. Every good RTS game ive ever played has done something to make the two teams really stand apart. Ground Control 2, all C&C games, War Craft and Star Craft are all examples of this. Also, all Total War games inately have this as well (because they seek to emulate real life)\n\nAll and all dispite my gripes, I really like what this game is trying to do and its original concepts and story are fresh and inovative. I dont nessisarally think this game recaptures what i felt when i played homeworld & homeworld 2 for the first time as a kid. However, although i may not find it to be the best made Homeworld game its still a good game if your just looking to play a game. I think maybe if they kept up on this path and didnt abandon it this titles predesessors will be truely amazing. For that reason i have to vote this game up.","January 22","true","13.3"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

After about 100 minutes play, I am concieved they did. This is a game fabricated with sincerity, deep understanding to the old HW games and creative thinking, which I have found lost in so many old frachises. It is hularious to see it. Some games, bearing the same name of the series and doing good job of keeping superficial things all along, have lost their core on the way. In contrast, this game keeps the core of homeworld, what makes fan like it, while has been creatively done in a very different way.\n\nA smart and enjoyable piece of work for me.","February 14","true","13.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a ground-based RTS sure but unlike any you have played.\n\nThe vehicles look gorgeous zipping along; zooming off sand dunes only to bounce on their bouncy-bouncy tires followed by hair-raising hand-brake turns so that they can get close to their prey to finish them off with their high caliber, high powered kinetic weapons.\n\nObliterate your enemy form the air by dispatching an air squad or gunship (the equivalent to an AC-130); finally turning them to molten slag by raining death from your bombers.\n\nFeel envious of the enemy's shiny railgun capital ship floating in the air in the same way that bricks don't?  Well just appropriate it with Rachel's groovy "obedience whip" (well hacking ray anyway) and its all yours!  Arrr! That be pirates in this 'ere dunes now!\n\nSend out your salvagers to gather much needed resources; go defend your allies carrier; defend against incoming units.  Oh no incoming ordinance!

Vehicles are well detailed and it has different types to keep things interesting.\n\nI do have several things I disliked. The campaign I feel could have been a bit longer. While I am satisfied with what we got, I feel that a few more missions would have helped. I do feel the mission variety did help a bit though.\n\nSeveral other users have made comments of the low textures. I feel I must partialy agree. While zoomed out and moving around the map it really isnt that noticeable, when zoomed in, it does become apparent.\n\nAll in all, I was happy with the game and the way it turned out.

Already having the remastered edition I got a discount on the buy. And since I pre-ordered I got the DoK Expedition Guide as well.\n\n\nHW DoK certainly brings you back into the franchise - there is no Mothership nor space 3D tactics, but HW DoK has the same feel to it as the other games had - same type of mission videos, well told story line, music. The game evolves much like the original games - steady upgrading of your Carrier (Mothership) and units with research, while scaveninging as much resources as you can out of every map. Basicly, for the same reasons I liked the original games so much I also like DoK.\n\nAs others have mentioned the multiplayer maps are few - yet for me, this doesn't matter all that much, as I mostly stick to single player.\nOtherwise, the main drawback of HW DoK, for me, is like the other HW games - It's so enjoyable it simply isn't enough of it and you keep wishing for more. (Perhaps that is why we like the franchise so much ?)\n\n\nThe Expedition guide adds a bit of history to Kharak and the Kushan people. Enjoyable read which expands a bit on the HW universe.","January 25","true","21.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

It's a ground-based RTS sure but unlike any you have played.\n\nThe vehicles look gorgeous zipping along; zooming off sand dunes only to bounce on their bouncy-bouncy tires followed by hair-raising hand-brake turns so that they can get close to their prey to finish them off with their high caliber, high powered kinetic weapons.\n\nObliterate your enemy form the air by dispatching an air squad or gunship (the equivalent to an AC-130); finally turning them to molten slag by raining death from your bombers.\n\nFeel envious of the enemy's shiny railgun capital ship floating in the air in the same way that bricks don't?  Well just appropriate it with Rachel's groovy "obedience whip" (well hacking ray anyway) and its all yours!  Arrr!

Think more like Supreme Commander 2 but on a more tactical scale. Combat features generally small engagements with well under 100 units per side, and the campaign can be drawn out in terms of time (especially by completionists who make sure to mine every penny on a map before moving on), but it isn't very complicated or difficult. The UI can also be a little wonky at times (good luck figuring out weapon ranges, and just try getting units to form up facing a particular direction), and it would be nice if the main camera could zoom out a little more so we don't always have switch to the strategic view.\n\nNonetheless, good voice acting, very good - and mature, thoguhtful - writing, nicely done cutscenes, and excellent music all combine with a beautiful aesthetic to make something very enjoyable. The levels may just all be rocks and sand, but they're memorable, and even though a couple of the units tend to blend into each other when amassed in great piles and viewed at a distance, a lot of thoughtful detail has been put into the audio-visual experience.\n\nIt's soothing. It may not require tactical genius or bring very much new to the RTS genre, but it's a fun piece of art.","April 9","true","10.9"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

That's the best description I can come up with.  Various vehicles act as near-direct counterparts to ships from the previous two space-side games.  You research to upgrade your units, build up your forces by sending out mining teams, and manage your forces to stay under the population cap, same as Homeworld. Terrain offers minor advantages or disadvantages compared to space, but overall the gameplay is more of the same.  The story plays out through movies with a painting-like aesthetic between missions or in-engine cutscenes during the missions.  Without spoilers, it's a decent story, if that sort of thing matters to you, not superior to original Homeworld but still very solid.\n\nIn short, if you liked Homeworld, you'll probably dig DoK.

I find the story pretty interesting and like the look of it but I am already bored of the old-school RTS gameplay in the campaign.\n\nI had the same issue with Starcraft2.  After playing Supreme Commander FA for hundreds of games and the Warhammer RTSs I just don't find much fun in spamming units, ramming some health bars into some enemy health bars and waiting for my inevitable win.  I want more strategic and tactical depth.  There is a rock-paper-scissors thing but it's extremely obvious when to use what unit so the only real challenge is in putting up with a bit of tedium and moving quickly.\n\nAlso, I DESPERATELY want to scroll the camera back more in non-sensor mode.  It feels super claustrophobic and I wrestle with the camera to get it pointed at the action in time to see anything.  Which makes me want to stay in sensor mode, which seems like a waste. SupCom solved this problem years ago, but in the name of old-school we gotta ignore that?\n\nAnd yes, even though I loved homeworld back in the day I had the same feeling of boredom when I replayed the recent remastered version.  That old school RTS thing was just played to death and does not entertain me anymore.\n\nI hate to thumbs it down because it does what it says on the tin.  But I am sad that I probably won't finish the interesting story because the gameplay is not very engaging.  I would only reccomend it to someone with a nostalgic love of retro or who is new to RTSs in general.","January 22","false","1.1"," 9 of 20 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","9","20","0","3"

I play in 1920x1200, as I have for over a decade. Settings are on ultra. The video looks terrible, definitely low res up-sample. Ok, but who needs video, it's purely cosmetic. The UI is upsampled, this is unforgivable. The UI for an RTS needs to be 1:1, functional, efficient and utilitarian. It is the most important part of the game. The map itself is not very good looking, but now I'm just complaining. I can get over this.\n- There is no mini-map!?! There is no way to hop the camera around from part of the map to another. All you have is pan/scan which is too slow and inefficient. There is "sensor mode" which is not a good substitute.\n- The AI doesn't seem to be very smart at all, it simply seems to rely on scripts and overwhelming force. It appears hard the first play, but then you learn the script and you prepare a defense. Really not that insightful.\n- The controls aren't very good, I can spend some time remapping, but honestly I expect at least a little effort to properly utilize my left hand (KB) and my right hand (mouse) for the actions I am going to be taking most often. I have to do this myself, for a large majority of the controls. Worst I have to waste keys for pan/scan that i would ordinarily never use.\n- I can't seem to access settings from in game, I have to drop to the main menu.\n- The voice acting is kind of weak. Rachel S'Jet doesn't have the kind of voice that projects either "strong soldier" or "savvy scientist". She sounds kind of like that girl you sat next to in algebra that thought math was hard. And you remember 10 years layer sitting in linear algebra with the professor droning about eigenstuff and wondering "Huh, I wonder what she'd think of this?"\n- The units have a lot of special abilities that seem very challenging to effectively use given the limitations of the UI. I expect I will spend 90% of my time with the arrow keys moving my camera around.\n\nI plan to return this game. I'm sorry, but either this was intended to be a dumbed down RTS for consoles, or it just was not well conceived by people who understand RTSs. Play one of the later Dunes, play Command & Conquer, play Warcraft or StarCraft (pre activision). Learn what an RTS should look and feel like first, then make it Homeworldized.

Come level 13 (last level) they gave me a ♥♥♥♥ing orbital ion cannon that killed the last boss in 5 hits (took me 4-5 minutes to kill him). Worst boss fight ever in a homeworld game, story was okay but the ending sucked (last move was about 20 seconds long), from playing homeworld 1 i already knew the story and knew BBI had a challenge infront of them, they had to create something that put the fans on edge. The biggest plot twist was when the sister carrier, Sakala turned on you in mission 11. Suprise suprise, did not see that coming at all *cough*. She only hanged around for half the game ofcourse it was bound that she would betray your cause.\n\nEnding credit says that they want to thank all homeworld fans, Diden't know they wanted to thank us by spitting us in the face with this halfassed title of a game. It is to short, it has zero replayability, the AI is a ♥♥♥♥ing joke... But hey atleast the game looks pretty (and outdated).\n\nOriginal Review below.\n\n\nWas looking forward for this game, being such a Homeworld fan.\n\nThe story is good, even if its predictable for people who played Homeworld 1 (first schematic of the game pretty much spoils this game).\n\nBeing 13 mission long it's a bit on the short side, you can easily complete the game in 6-7 hours, and there isen't much of repliablity. Seing that most strategy games let you play the "story" from diffrent factions and this game only lets you play the game in the eyes of the "good guys", not like say Red Alert where you can play the campaign as both Allies and Soviets with diffrent missions.\n\nThe unit roster dosen't bring much to the table, and uses the traditional rock, paper, scissor. Where late game cruisers (battle cruisers/assault cruisers) being all around.\n\nThe game also feels unpolished, when i came to mission 8-9 the game unlocked like all research options at once, letting me research about 15 projects at once, in earlier missions you got like 1-2 research projects. So it felt kinda rushed, as soon as you get near end game, they unlock everything at once instead of having a progressive research tree.  Can't remember Homeworld ever did this. From what i can recall you get the Heavy Cruiser/Battle Cruiser research on the last 2 missions.\n\nAlso they added "nukes" in the form of cruise missiles. They are OP as hell and cost like 500 CU (Construction Units) to build and thats it. I had near 25000 CU's on the eight missions, so i could easily stand on standoff ranges and nuke the oppenents carriers without any skills whatsoever. Fun stuff! Right? No?\n\nGame also crashed 5-6 times durning campaing, Being a new release i'd figure that much so can't complain to much.\n\nIt looks great, sounds great, i love the detail, units contacting the carrier to get information as background noise, that immersion! Love it.\n\nHowever compared to Homeworld 1 and 2, this game falls short.\n\nI'd recommend it, barely if compared to Homeworld 1 and 2. As a standalone game without any comparison its short and overpriced, Fells like a DLC for any Command and conquer game of some sort.\n\nEdit: As of writing this, 57% of the people who rated my review like to play games that hold your hand and is way to easy. This isen't a strategy game people, its a tutorial for... i don't even know what to call it.\n\nRest in peace Homeworld.

A keyboard key to toggle the overlay would have been more useful.\n- positioning units, particularly large groups of units, to take advantage of elevation is virtually impossible as there are:\n- no formations for units\n- no way of specifying the orientation of units or groups of units\n- despite LOS being such an important mechanic, you will often find half your units have none, and there's little you can do about it.\n\nI love the concept and art design. The UI is fine. Music is spot on and the Story is OK, just under presented.\n\nI think most punters were surprised when this was announced. Almost seems like the release date was a little bit of a surprise for the developers - seems as if they were rushed into getting this out the door well before it was ready, otherwise I would be DEEPLY surprised if all these game dev vets who were supposedly working on the title would have been content shipping it.\n\nIf development continues post release and some of the above gets fixed, I would gladly change my review.

I've always been afraid of strategy games, they always seemed full of different systems and features, hard to understand. This game however, looked very easy to understand and so it is. Its great fun and it makes me finally like a strategy game for the first time in my 25 year old life. Rachel is great as your protagonist the story is the "lets fight for resources" standard in the genre, but they still tell the story very nicely with good movielike cutscenes before each mission, which draws me into the universe every time after putting it down for a while.\n\nThe game has a great learning curve. When I fail, its because I did not understand the features of a unit from the get go, and not because the game failed to tell me but because I just am so fresh and new in the genre. I never liked a gearbox-published game, this is the first one that I fell in love with. Please let the studio do the franchise from now on, and don't make it as complicated as the competitors. For me this was an amazing experience already and I'm only almost half-way through. I can only speak of single player, since I dont dare to try face off against other people. Just wanna get the basics straight for now.\n\nTechnically it seems very polished and clean, it has this "plastic" look that Portal invented. Some people call bad fps on this title, I never dropped below 60, but then again I only face off against AI in single player missions. Voice over work is also amazing.

According to their (more than likely automated) response;\n\n"Requests are considered on a case by case basis and are not typically issued for purchases of released products that are more than 14 days old, or if the purchased product has more than 2 hours of playtime. For in-game items the refund period is 48 hours and the item must not have been consumed, modified, or transferred."\n\nThe reason given is that I've played more than 2 hours. I'm sorry, but a blanket 2 hour window to request a refund for a game will never cover the multitude of possible reasons someone might request a refund, and it is potentially a massive problem for games that don't even last 2 hours. I've made it clear in subsequent requests that I would like a non-automated response to my concerns as the spiel indicates can and should happen, and yet again, did not receive one.\n\nFurthermore, there is no way to directly contact Customer Service (if in fact such a thing does even exist) about my issues.\n\nI don't even want a full refund. I want acknowledgement of my concerns and a real person to communicate with me. I have only ever requested a refund once before (for something that I've never even installed) and I wouldn't make such a request if I didn't feel strongly about this. I would be happy for Steam to keep their % of the sale and give me something back out of what's left. Something that I can use for a product that isn't advertised to be something that it's not. The game itself is not terrible, but it's certainly not worth the price of admission compared to any somewhat equivalent product.\n\n\nFinal Verdict: Ambivalence\n\nIf money is not an issue, and/or you love slightly slower paced multiplayer RTSs, and/or anything Homeworld is simply your "jam", get it, get it right now.\n\n\nIf you're looking for something single player, well;\n\n- For a number of reasons, the gameplay isn't the least bit challenging, even on "hard" difficulty. I finished the campaign on hard, barely losing a single unit, with enough spare resources to rebuild my fleet several times over.\n\n- It's ridiculously short. I think I've logged around 12 hours at this point, and that's including a few skirmish maps. Add to that the fact that if you spend time mining, it'll slow down your gameplay significantly, and that is something I did.\n\n- The scenarios desperately lack imagination. Researching and developing new units and abilities is interesting and all, but there was never any particular tactics or strategies necessary to succeed, and only a few story-related mechanics.\n\n\nI love Homeworld, and aesthetically and thematically, Deserts of Kharak does a grand number of things right. If that's all you need for a good time, grab it and look past it's faults. Just bear in mind that unless you're looking to blast your mates apart time and time again, there just won't be much to it.\n\nGonna have to go with a Not Recommended for now.","January 21","false","12.9"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","2","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bronzite/recommended/281610/","bronzite","Bronzite","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bronzite/","362 products in account","While Deserts of Kharak certainly was inspired by the Homeworld series, and the touchstones fans are looking for are present, the execution of the game demonstrates a bewildering naïveté by the developers who never seemed to get their arms around what they were writing.\n\nFirst, let me say this game is beautiful.  The artists did a top-notch job, and the cinematics feel like a more evolved form of Homeworld's black-and-white, simply animated cut scenes.  The new characters, the models, and the interface all compare favorably with modern RTS's.\n\nThe main problem I had with Deserts of Kharak actually had to do with the way the setting, the mission design, the visual design, and world never seem to meet, and indeed, actively clash in numerous places.\n\nLet's start with the visual design.  Deserts of Kharak, as the name suggests, takes place almost exclusively on enormous, tan dunes of sand.  There's very little visual distinction between terrain rises, falls, and textures.  If the game were in VR or otherwise provided steroscopic vision to the user, this might be less of a problem, but as it stands, just reading the terrain you're looking at can be surprisingly difficult.\n\nSecondly, there's the units.  They're the same color as the terrain they're sitting on.  While that would probably make sense for a desert fighting force, from a gameplay perspective, it makes interacting with your units from the main game view very tricky.  Even with the overlays that provide different shapes for different types of units, it can be a challenge even to see a unit, let along distinguish what kind of unit it is.\n\nThe sensor manager from Homeworld is back, and provides the shape-based overlays for both friendly and enemy units.  Unlike Homeworld, though, terrain plays a major role in the micromanagement-heavy gameplay of Deserts, as does unit orientation.  Neither bit of information is clearly expressed in the sensor manager, and as a result attempting to control the battle from the sensor manager can be something of an exercise in surprise and frustration.\n\nThe sensor manager also gives me an opportunity to segue into the issues with the mission design.  Especially early in the game, the missions introduce challenge by having enemy units attack simultaneously from multiple different directions.  In principle, that's fine, and it makes sense in the context of the story, but that type of mission is singularly poorly-suited to the interface of Deserts.  Because the game encourages, to the point of requiring, micromanagement of units, and because you can only get a view of the battle as a whole from the sensor manager (which is an entirely separate screen), it is very easy for a player to simply be unaware of a new attack force or front moving in from a different position.\n\nTo put it in more technical terms, the other games in the Homeworld franchise could get away with their UI choices because the missions always made it clear there was a defined axis of attack.  Deserts of Kharak does away with that choice, and while it is unlikely to cause a player to fail a mission outright (although certainly possible), it feeds a feeling not that the enemy is outsmarting you, but that the interface you're using isn't up to the task you've been set to.\n\nFinally, the story is... strange.  It moves in fits and jerks, asks a lot of questions, and answers few.  Long-time fans of the Homeworld universe will undoubtedly be left scratching their heads at a number of the retcons that were introduced to support the new story.  The end of the campaign comes suddenly, and the few seconds we're spared of denounement do nothing to resolve any of the questions raised to that point, or hint at the fate of the characters between the end of this game and the beginning of Homeworld 1.\n\nUltimately, and in spite of the Making Of content, this game feels like a game written about a science fiction desert society, that was crowbarred into the Homeworld franchise by adjusting the interface and story, but ignoring the game design lessons of its predecessors.  Deserts of Kharak would've been much better served to have simply remained Shipbreakers and stood on its own.  By becoming a Homeworld game, both the franchise and this product have been diminished.","January 23","false","9.6"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

There's a lot more going on.\nAt some point, it even felt a little bit like C&C Generals (If anyone remembers that game).  And yes, that's a weird and probably wrong comparsion to make (atleast according to some people), but the speed and action reminded me of that game.\n\nI miss some things, especially from the Remastered version of Homeworld. Battles are not as customizable as they were before. I can't change the population limit or ressource density anymore, which, since I like long and drawn out battles, really is a bummer. Also, it feels like there are less units available, so you feel limited. That's not really true, because you got your awesome carrier that you can upgrade into a truly powerful battlewagon and Aircraft is just amazing.\n\nThe graphics are absolutely stunning, BUT... if you zoom in and take a close look at your carrier or other vehicles, you notice some low res textures, but since you not often have the time to watch a battle errupt, that's not that bad.\n\nThe sound, oh man, the sound. It's brilliant. I love the sound design. Explosions have a good amount of *WAAM* in them, aircraft flying by your ground troops sounds like in a movie. Perfect.

That feels like a bit of a mistake now.\n\nWhile I enjoyed the story and had fun playing the game I completed it on normal difficulty in under eight hours. That was taking my time too, I was a little too cautious on several missions which in hindsight I could have beat with a small force. Once you got a decent fleet put together you can own everything pretty easily.\n\nFor $50 I just feel like there is not enough meat here to justify that cost. I would recommend this game at $20-$25 but it is not up to the standards of most of the other games you can get in this price range.\n\nFor me to recommend it at $50 I would like to see a much more envolved campaign more, different more challenging missions. More of a flushed out story, while I enjoyed the general story line it feels like the cliff notes version and could do with having more details flushed out.\n\n","January 26","false","8.4"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

Add it to your list and wait for the price to drop a bit.\n\nI’m gonna go on the record and say I loved Homeworld. In fact, I even made a Babylon 5 themed mod years back for the original (Conflicts of Interest), so I was super excited for this game.\n\nSpoiler free review.\n\n\nPositives\n\nArt direction  - Continuing the unique homeworld aesthetic, it’s almost minimalist letting silhouette and contrast describe things rather than piling on armour plate after plate. Its visually a breath of fresh air especially today when a lot of sci-fi these days is just over blinged crap (I’m looking at you Halo, StarCraft). The endless dunes in conjunction with massive machines is genuinely cool. The cut scenes are also fantastic, it’s a sublime mixture of 2.5d animation with in game cinematics.\n\nHomeworld feel  – The game is a prequel so naturally it’s going to borrow things but it really does recreate that feeling of the original. Unit icons, radio chatter, upgrading functionality of your fleet is all very reminiscent of the original.\n\nMusic, sound and voice acting  – Everything again feels spot on. From explosions to the urgency of dialogue in the middle of a battle, it’s extremely well produced.\n\n\nNegatives\nThe game is really short for a $50 title. I know I got the remastered editions of HW1 and 2 with it, originally I thought this was a plus, but now I almost wish I didn’t, did the price get pumped up to justify this? The missions themselves offer very little in diversity compared to SC2. Many missed opportunities here.\n\nFactional mirror matchup. Well one has tracks and moves a bit slower and the other has hover engines and moves a bit faster. It’s cool visually but gameplay wise after 6ish hours it really just feels visual. Disappointing.\n\nHomeworld feel  – The original came out eons ago, and while it was mind blowing at the time, I can’t help but feel like some things should change by now. No minimap. Yes, there’s a sensor manager but I just feel it’s a holdover from when you needed a fully 3d map(for homeworld). It’s too much toggling. It feels unnatural these days to be toggling on a mode that is essentially an oversized minimap. You can’t appreciate the art of the game while doing this, and you can’t properly manage any large scale battle without resorting to looking at light blue on darker blue boxes to decide the outcome of things. It’s kind of like how pro StarCraft players turn the settings all way down but to the nth degree. It’s cool for a mission briefing but I’ve grown to despise it for in game usage.\n\nSome units are also criminally forgettable  and look the same at a distance. Resource collectors and light units. Gotta use that sensor manager to select resourcers properly. But then Cruisers, all of them just blend into each other. In the sensor manager, battlecruisers, artillery cruisers and support cruisers share the same damn icon. But as they have vastly different functions, you have to zoom in or listen to the radio feedback when selecting them. But then you can’t see what’s happening on to your other units because you aren’t using the sensor manager to look at things, ugh. It’s just annoying. I’m forced to look at stupid light blue on blue boxes to issue orders and have map awareness, but it just hurts the experience. I can’t appreciate the little firing animations or the little clouds of dust they kick up when moving. Stop taking me out of the experience \n\nWhile the story is cool it’s also a bit naff. What do I mean? Well it drops you right in the middle of things and sets you up for an epic ride, and it just doesn’t quite get there. The motivations of your foes are quite flimsy, it feels a bit rushed or cut short. It basically left me feeling a lot of why and what and then just ok whatever towards the end.\n\nUI annoyances - Burying build units under icons. I found it rather irritating that building units you have to select your carrier, then select a box, an arrow shaped box, a diamond shaped box or a slightly askew box to then build light medium air or heavy units. The icon differences are just crap and it feels unnecessary given that there really aren’t that many units total to justify the categorization. The game focuses on quick decision making while managing your entire fleet and their abilities, this is something that takes away from your concentration in a big fight.  Basically the game definitely is a step back from the control and finesse system of SC2.\nI honestly did enjoy the game, and won’t be asking for a refund or anything but since steam only allows for positive or negative and not something in between, I’m going to have to go with negative mainly due to the current price. I was also kind of a superfan of homeworld, so for a newcomer I think at around $30(USD) would’ve been a good price (turn the recommendation to yes) for this title.\nI’ve been harsh on the game but only because of how I had such high hopes. My negatives really aren’t show stopping in any way, but I feel like the current price point the game just doesn’t offer enough to justify things. I both love the homeworld feel but also feel like BBI hamstrung themselves adhering to it so closely. They wanted genre defining but I feel like this will simply stand as a good game, not as the standout title that Homeworld was.","January 21","false","5.5"," 3 of 9 people (33%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","33","3","9","0","0"

It is very lacking in features and full of bugs. Only thing that felt complete is the campaign, and that alone is not worth the 40-50 dollar price. It really saddens me to see such a good series in the past do so poor now.\nThe camera controls were buggy, units lacking, ai just dumb as bricks, and the amount of skirmish maps I can count on my hand is pathetic. Individual unit behavior is pretty bad too. The entire high ground feature is more of a gimmick and ends up hindering your units are they are too dumb to move half a foot to crest a hill to shoot enemies and instead stare at the small hill while the rest of the selected units get shot up. I don't know if they were rushed from gearbox or the ip transition was too difficult for a small team, or what happened, but this game is bad. 4/10 just for the good cut scenes and campaign. 2/10 for actual gameplay.","January 20","false","10.0"," 20 of 47 people (43%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","43","20","47","2","0"

Very little different troop types, i mean really about 14 units in game.\n2. Unit limit of 125 and then you have to build these stupid pods to give you more troops up to 125 which the enemy keeps on destroying.\n3. You can only harvest with 2 harversters at a time on a harvest spot.\n4. 5 skirmish maps, reallly??? i mean come on and then the biggest one is 6 player and small at that as well.\n5. Not a lot of research and not even enough money on map to even research everything.\n6. Choppy graphics especially in the cutscenes, i mean really, i have a GTX970 G1 Gaming card and choppy. I play Witcher III on full graphics and not choppy.\n7. Controls are crap and when units close together it keeps on selecting just the one and you have to select all just to select the one you really wanted. Not good at all.\n8. Cannot even save in a skirmish, so if i must go after playing for hours in a skirmish, then i must either leave the pc on or just abandon the game. What a crap scaled down version from what Homeworld used to be.\n\nThis is a scaled down version of what Homeworld was and then at $50 price tag as well. This is maybe worth $25.\nGo play Homeworld Remastered or buy something else.\n\nI am really not happy and was waiting for this game hoping to be as homeworld. This whole game feels scaled down with so few troop variety and unit limit. In Homeworld i did not really feel the unit limit because there was so many diffirent troop types and just felt bigger.\n\nWait for a bargain.\n\nI feel like refunding this game.","January 20","false","8.7"," 22 of 59 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","22","59","0","7"

Right clicking puts the mouse in view mode rather than interpreting it as a move order. Control-dragging often results in a selection rather than an attack box.

The technical sci-fi unit chatter was there, the strategic overlay was a familiar blue with helpful unit icons, and my fleet was setting off into the emptiness of space the desert.\n\nDoK is a love song to the original 1999 Homeworld in all of the best ways.  Although I found myself missing the Z-axis, the rest of the Homeworld formula remained quite intact--from the strike/armored/ranged/cruiser unit types to the versatile camera movement. It also speaks to the fluid controls that I was able to play the entire game easily with a Steam Controller :)\n\nThe story in DoK also does a great job of mirroring the great continuity that was present from mission to mission in vanilla Homeworld.  You are not jumping around the planet/galaxy on various missions like in a Starcraft or C&C game--it is just your fleet on a long, difficult journey.  And true to the 1999 original's legacy, your fleet persists from mission to mission, so units left alive at the end of a battle are able to continue on in the campaign (now with helpful veterancy bonuses).\n\nOne place where I was a little disappointed was with the difficulty of DoK.  Although the campaign's strong narrative does a good job of making you feel a sense of urgency, I found that I was able to take losses and keep going way more than I could in the original Homeworld--even on Hard difficulty.  This lack of extreme difficulty also made the game effectively shorter for me (17 hours for the campaign) than its 1999 brother, even though I think the number of campaign missions was comparable.\n\nThe easier difficulty could be partly due to lulls in the fighting that allow ample time for your salvagers to hoover up every last resource in the AO--a tactic that was essential in 1999 Homeworld--so I was rarely wanting for resources.  But I really only found myself sweating before I had built up a fleet in some of the early missions, and in a couple cases where my fleet was not available on account of some smaller scale missions.\n\nBut I have a fix for these gripes.  I was not planning on getting the Homeworld: Remastered Collection before; but DoK has left me so thirsty for the brand of storytelling that has been true of all of the Homeworld games that I cannot resist grabbing the Remaster at this point.","February 25","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I love the homeworld games. I played the original back in 98 and cant understand why this hasnt been a more successful line. I recently played the remastered versions of the originals and enjoyed them all over again and I have to say I enjoyed this too. The campaign has always been the Homeworld strong point, but like the originals they are frustratingly too short. Hopefully now they are on Steam, more missions will be added. The ending of DoK is very abrupt and cries for more story. The game mechanics are great and the amount of missions don't really let you explore each units special ablility but I'm hoping these are all available in the multiplayer which I dont have much experiance with yet.\nThis really feels like it should be a beta realease with more content to come... fingers crossed.","February 26","true","32.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Deleting the config and letting it regenerate does not help as it is stored in the steam cloud and is downloaded each time you launch.  So annoying.\n\nMouse control was erratic and has something to do with having joysticks plugged in - unplug all joysticks if you are having erratic mouse issues.\n\nGame is sometimes jerky and slow sometimes (not always) even on extremely overclocked high performance machines and I suspect it has to do with Unitiy.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI'm very unpleased with not having unit formations.\n\nI like the guard function for its circle type formation, however, when something is being guarded the guarding vehicles don’t defend (when they are out of range) - They really should “GUARD” the unit in question…\n\nThe AI in this game is very dumb to non-existent.\n\nIt was a fun game for its story as it fits the Homeworld story timeline.","February 22","true","23.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

For reference, I am far more interested in the single player campaign than multiplayer/skirmish.\n\nPositives:\n\n-The feel of the game was very reminisent of the origional Homeworld game.  Everything about the art style and the music was very much in keeping with the orgional.\n- Going along with this was the quality of the vehicle and fleet designs and compostion.  I did not feel like there were any useless units, and overall the game felt well balanced.\n- The game was fun.  Both the story and the gameplay were generally immersive and fun.\n\nNegatives/Improvements\n\n- As mentioned elsewhere, the campaign was short.  In general, the whole game felt smaller, not as grand in scale, as the origional Homeworld Games.\n- A lot of interesting things happen off screen.  The inclusion of the "Feild Guide" was a nice piece of worldbuilding, but some of the things in it would have made for great missions, or would have made the reasons for some in game events make more sense.  I would have liked to see more of the guide included in the actual game.\n- The control scheme is a bit basic.  Something as simple as the ability to rotate your arrival points would have been greatly appreciated.  In general I thought the controls were adequet, but were a bit dated.\n\nOverall\n\nAs noted, I liked the game, and as a huge fan of the origional Homeworld I REALLY liked it, but for most people, wait until it hits $20.\n\n*Still waiting for a remake of Homeworld: Cataclysm though :(","March 17","true","18.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It would be nice for a continue after mission ends to gather these.  So save often.\n-Storyline is predictable, but it barely matters.

This game has both of it. The desert is looking gorgeous and the story is subtle and compelling. The campaign gives you a sense of discovery and adventure.\n\nYou get to keep your units between missions and see them level up, gaining many times the power it had when it was a rookie. You get a feeling of responsibility towards the survival of said units, and I've reloaded a save game many times in order to save a unit from getting destroyed.\n\nOtherwise the mechanics of the game are pretty straight forward. It's a case of stone-rock-scissors, even up in the tiers of units. You gather resources and spend them on new units (up to a unit cap that increases during the campaign) and on research which is done from the carrier which acts as your mobile base.\n\nFor the atmosphere and story I thoroughly recommend this game.

This game is fantastic. As a huge fan of the original Homeworld games, I was cautious about a Homeworld prequel game, especially given the fact that the game was being developed by someone other than the original developers, Relic. My fears appear to have been unfounded. What struck me immediately was the tone and feel of Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak. It's pitch perfect, completely reminicent of the original games. Everything, down to the music, effects and even the comm chatter between units...it's all so great. I've played 3 of the campaign missions thus far, and the gameplay is fantastic. Controls are smooth, intuitive, simple and easy to use. Combat requires a bit of strategy (for example, using terrain for a height advantage, using unit abilities to turn the tide of a battle) and it's challenging but for me the bottom line is always...is it fun? YES, yes it is. Given what I've seen thus far, I am so pleased that the Homeworld series appears to have risen from the dead. The series appears to be in the capable hands of Blackbird Interactive and Gearbox Software and if this game is any indication of what the future might hold...the future of Homeworld seems bright indeed. I'll likely update this review as I get further into the campaign and try out the Skirmish mode, but as of this moment I highly, highly recommend to anyone who loved the original Homeworld games or fans of RTS games in general.

My favorite game was H2, however this game has become my favorite game out of the series. I just finished it on normal and it took me about 21 hours. That isn't too bad considering I haven't tried multiplayer or skirmishes yet.\n\nOne of the major reasons why I love it so much, is that you can take the campaign at your own pace. What I mean by that is that you can resource first, and hoarde the CUs before you complete mission objectives most of the time. This gives you alot of flexibility and you end up being able to change your strategies often to minimize unit loss, and cause the most destruction.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of RTS games where the meta is fast and cheap zerg strategy. You never really get to use the really cool, heavy units and It's just, well - Boring to me. THIS game does not seem to reward the fast and cheap strategy. It was all about the heavy, destructive units. I had a lot of fun using them! There are a TON of resources in the mid to late game missions and it's nice to be able to really max out your fleet easily enough.\n\nFair warning - The game does NOT auto-collect resources if you finish a mission, so make sure to collect all the resources you can in the early to mid campaign.\n\nAnother thing that impressed me was the amount of unit abilities, things you can research, combinations of ships where their skills compliment eachother. It seems well put together. The unit pathing is fairly easy to control - I rarely if ever mis-moved units to their death.\n\nAir units are sick. Make sure to take out AA. Did I mention the air units are sick?\n\nTurrets are sick. Make sure to set up regular and AA turrets. They will make things easier for you to defend.\n\nUse the higher ground tactics with units and turrets - Sit them at the top of a hill and they do more damage and get a bonus to armor as well I think.\n\nThe story was good. It ties in directly with HW1. The ending could have been better, but that's all I'll say about it.\n\nOne thing I missed is the mothership/small carrier upgrading where you would make them what you wanted in terms of modules. This game has a linear upgrade path and you don't get a choice as to how they upgrade except in two ways; 1. You can collect artifacts (Carrier plug-ins) 2. You can research carrier upgrades. So it's limited in that sense. However, you do use the heck out of the main carrier - The Kapisi. Without spoiling anything - You eventually get smaller carriers capable of construction, and they're awesome. You'll see.\n\nYou also use the main character's baserunner a lot. She gets some really awesome abilities. One of them is hacking. Use it on the larger enemy ships for some free crusiers ;) She also gets EMP which is crazy - It really does a number on enemy units.\n\nThe audio is what you'd expect - Excellent. It feels like a Homeworld game in every sense.\n\nThe effects are very well done. The turrets, missiles, lasers, engine sounds, explosions - All very immersive.\n\nThe graphics are very good IMO. There are some anomalies here and there like clipping of units through things, but it's not too bad.\n\nGame optimization is excellent. I have an i5-2500k and an nvidia 660ti 2GB w/16gb of DDR3 and a Samsung 256GB 850pro SSD. Ran the game on full ultra settings. The game ran most of the time at 60FPS. Some cutscenes dipped below that, but I never saw stuttering or artifacting, etc. Top notch programming there.\n\nI love the art style. The detailing of the maps, units, backdrops, etc. are great. I spent a lot of time just looking around at all the units :D\n\nOverall, I'd rate this a 10/10. The reasons that I've described can all be funneled down to one thing - I had a LOT of fun playing the game and couldn't put it down.\n\nThank you BBI and Gearbox for an awesome game! I'm excited for the next Homeworld installment! Hopefully it's 3D/Set in space :)\n\n-BoostBlitzen","February 20","true","21.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The technical sci-fi unit chatter was there, the strategic overlay was a familiar blue with helpful unit icons, and my fleet was setting off into the emptiness of space the desert.\n\nDoK is a love song to the original 1999 Homeworld in all of the best ways.  Although I found myself missing the Z-axis, the rest of the Homeworld formula remained quite intact--from the strike/armored/ranged/cruiser unit types to the versatile camera movement. It also speaks to the fluid controls that I was able to play the entire game easily with a Steam Controller :)\n\nThe story in DoK also does a great job of mirroring the great continuity that was present from mission to mission in vanilla Homeworld.  You are not jumping around the planet/galaxy on various missions like in a Starcraft or C&C game--it is just your fleet on a long, difficult journey.  And true to the 1999 original's legacy, your fleet persists from mission to mission, so units left alive at the end of a battle are able to continue on in the campaign (now with helpful veterancy bonuses).\n\nOne place where I was a little disappointed was with the difficulty of DoK.  Although the campaign's strong narrative does a good job of making you feel a sense of urgency, I found that I was able to take losses and keep going way more than I could in the original Homeworld--even on Hard difficulty.  This lack of extreme difficulty also made the game effectively shorter for me (17 hours for the campaign) than its 1999 brother, even though I think the number of campaign missions was comparable.\n\nThe easier difficulty could be partly due to lulls in the fighting that allow ample time for your salvagers to hoover up every last resource in the AO--a tactic that was essential in 1999 Homeworld--so I was rarely wanting for resources.  But I really only found myself sweating before I had built up a fleet in some of the early missions, and in a couple cases where my fleet was not available on account of some smaller scale missions.\n\nBut I have a fix for these gripes.  I was not planning on getting the Homeworld: Remastered Collection before; but DoK has left me so thirsty for the brand of storytelling that has been true of all of the Homeworld games that I cannot resist grabbing the Remaster at this point.","February 25","true","17.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

While I'm overjoyed to see the original developers back in control of the IP and doing new things with it, I don't think this game ended up being what I wanted it to be.\n\nIt's a ground-based RTS that tries to be like the space-based games in some respects. This works well in some ways, but is a bit odd in others. Aircraft, the units most like units in the original games, are pretty nuked, and maneuvering/management of ground units is less seamlessly intuitive than fleet management in 2 or RM. I found myself playing a LOT of the game out of the sensors manager, because it was too difficult to get a strategic view from the main camera.\n\nWhen I heard BBI got the rights to use the Homeworld Universe and was going to turn Hardware: Shipbreakers into a prequel, I was most excited to see them draw on the existing body of backstory from the first game. This they certainly did in spades; the main antagonist of the game is discussed at length in the original game's manual, and indeed I went back to read my ~15-year-old copy to understand the plot better. They did a great job fitting the campaign's plot into the existing mythos, and even the retcons make perfect sense and don't feel weird given the plot of the first game.\n\nHowever, though the campaign story was exactly the one I wanted to be told, I don't think it was told very well. All the events I wanted to see happened on-screen and seemed to make sense within the mythos, but some of them just felt... awkward. The game seemed to expect players to be familiar with the plot of the first game, and so did not conceal critical information or make certain assumptions that I think should have been in place in the first half of the campaign. The main voices in the game transitioned far too rapidly from early exposition to a mentality that seemed more suited to AFTER the game's plot, and seemed to demonstrate knowledge of a certain ship's specific nature well before they should have known or even guessed that information. I would have really liked to see this story told with a greater degree of unfamiliarity and doubt on the part of the characters; it would have made the wonder of the final revelation much more dramatic, the way I always pictured it when playing the first game.\n\nI also found the campaign painfully short. Homeworld is known for its short campaigns that give you just enough to invest you, not enough to satisfy you, but the norm is 16 or 17 missions. HW:DoK has 13. I could point out specific parts of the map that I feel could have had additional missions.\n\nOverall, the campaign felt rushed, and some of the game mechanics feel somewhat underdeveloped. I would have loved to see more done with the heat mechanic, for example. The unit designs don't present as cohesive of a theme as the original game's did, and though I give BBI props for recreating the 'feel' of 2 nearly seamlessly in a completely different game engine (Unity), the graphics didn't blow my mind and make me squee the way HW:RM's did.\n\nSo, why am I recommending this game if I'm giving it so much flak? A couple reasons. Firstly, I think some of the game's limitations are due to the nature of its production. I almost feel like it would have been a better game if BBI had NOT gotten the rights to the IP, though I'm still glad they did. I'm not sure this game was ready to be "the next Homeworld game", though it could have been an interesting game in its own right.\n\nSecondly, it's hardly a bad game. I'm not as into ground-based RTSes, but it's well-balanced (though, knowing the homeworld fanbase, I'm sure everyone and his mom will disagree) and has a number of different effective strategies. The combat is fast-paced and dynamic, and the lack of base-building and presence of universal unit mobility really makes it feel like a homeworld game in some regards.\n\nThirdly, they did tell the story I wanted to be told, and didn't make any fatal retcons. For comparison, I felt HW2 was actually worse about this - in 2 it's established that the hyperspace core used in the mothership is 'special', and to do this they had to retcon parts of the original game's manual that mentioned it being 'reverse-engineered' and scaled up to handle the mothership's mass. I also felt 2's endgame made some bad choices about the direction of the universe and some of the explanations for its mechanics. DoK did much better about this - Kharak is Kharak. My inner cartography nerd was even squeeing when recognizing geographic/stylistic elements I remembered from reading the manual as a kid.\n\nI'm excited to see what BBI does next with the property, and I think existing Homeworld fans should play this game, more for closure than anything else. However, don't come into it expecting the atmospheric/mood quality of the original Homeworld or the mechanical polish of 2/RM. You'll be very disappointed.","February 5","true","16.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I did not find it an issue at all that there was no permanent minimap on the corner of the screen.\n\nThe units that you can build are not overwhelming, the first three attacking units that you build in the campaign are very rock, paper, scissors. however at the end of the campaign I stopped building them in favor of the heavier 'cruisers' and 'basebuilders' and I just turtled for when the enemy arrives.\n\nThe bugs I have come across was when your vehicle's randomly started doing barrel rolls as they drive forward. random stuttering (not from my pc), one random air unit that died and was still floating in the air, shadows in some of the cinematics were not full (very choppy), small texture bugs in scenery and unit selection boxes or attack move boxes staying up (cycling to the minimap helped remove that).\n\n\nStill a good campaign for the $40 i paid for it, it was worth it.\n","January 21","true","14.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/waspus500/recommended/281610/","waspus500","Waspus","http://steamcommunity.com/id/waspus500/","105 products in account","TL;DR\n\nGame is fun. Units are well thought out and the game is welcoming of many different strategies. Campaign could be longer, there could be more skirmish maps, but overall quite fun for any RTS fan.\n\nLong Review\n\nSome of the top reviews for this game are negative. I'm not sure what angle they're coming at the game or what their background on RTS games is, but I can assure you that if you're an RTS fan, especially if you're a Homeworld fan, you will enjoy this game.\n\nIt plays very similar to Starcraft in terms of unit construction, resource gathering, giving orders to units and other aspects. If you're looking for a grand-scale RTS like Supreme Commander, Total War, Age of Empires / Mythology or anything like that, don't even consider this game. It's decidedly very small-scale.\n\nThe main object of the gaim is centered around these giant, land-going aircraft carriers. We won't discuss the necessity of such a device, but the aim is to protect your own and destroy your enemy's. They have very high health but poor defense systems, and can be upgraded in a variety of ways by "shunting" power to their various systems, including weapons, armor and repairs.\n\nNext, you have small units, which are Salvagers, LAVs, and Baserunners. Salvagers gather resources, known as CUs and RUs, that allow you to construct new units and purchase upgrades for your existing ones. LAVs are your basic combat vehicle that can be upgraded to a miniscule extent over time, and Baserunners do a variety of things including deploying turrets, AA batteries, and collecting Artifacts, one of the objectives in Skirmish mode.\n\nThen you have your heavy vehicles. Missile batteries, railguns, and armored assault vehicles. I don't use these too much so the best extent I can describe them to is that they are simply more powerful, slower-moving LAVs.\n\nNext are your aerial vehicles; interceptors, gunships, and bombers. They are deployed from your aircraft carrier and all serve to attack ground targets. They move quickly and deal surprisingly high damage. They're actually a bit overpowered if you ask me.\n\nFinally, you have cruisers. Support cruisers, battlecruisers, assault cruisers and artillery cruisers. Support cruisers act as mobile drop-off points for resources, so they're good for resource gathering operations that are far away from your carrier, and the other three are basically giant, slow-moving attack vehicles that deal very high damage, especially to large groups.\n\nAs I stated before, this game is very friendly towards many different strategies and playstyles. You can check out some gameplay videos on youtube, including ones that I may or may not put up in the future to get a better idea of the gameplay.\n\nThe campaign is fun, if short, and offers a few new units and abilities that you can't get in Skirmish mode, namely different types of Baserunners with different abilities. The missions are all pretty much "Move from this point to this point, fight off wave after wave of enemy, and collect resources along the way". You do get to keep your constructed units and upgrades from mission to mission, so that's a nice touch.\n\nThe story is interesting and the art is very nice too. Nobody plays RTS games for the graphics so I'll leave it at "The art style is nice". Some people in the reviews down below complained of stuttering, I haven't experienced that myself but I do have an absolute beast of a PC (980 Ti / 6700k) so exercise caution. Turning down the graphics if you have to really doesn't hinder your experience.\n\nThe AI could stand to be better, I play on normal difficulty in both skirmish and campaign, and its strategy in skirmish mode anyway is to send wave after wave of Sandskimmers (Small, light attack vehicles) that are instantly dispatched by my cruisers.\n\nIn all, this is a fun game, a bit lacking for the price but what can you do. I definitely recommend it, you will have fun whether you pay $6 or $60.","February 2","true","6.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

A desert landscape isnt that hard to do I assume? The units have really crappy textures. What i find annoying is the game forces you to use Ultra graphics forced with ANTIALIASING which is the prime FPS killer. I try to cancel AA but then the game gives me a message my hardware isnt good for this game and turns textures down to high, If you want to use Ultra textures you are forced to enable AA.\n\nHomeworld is bascially dead, they tried to cash in on the homeworld name but had they released this game as a standalone and not with the homeworld game perhaps it would have been taken in a better light, but the expectations that people expect OF a homeworld game are not really here.\n\nTL;DR\n\nGaem doesn't have the graphics people expect in 2015-16 ( modders will, ofcourse, fix that soon )( HW2 original looks better)\nGaem is really simple to play, not complex like in Homeworld 1 or other such RTS's,\nGaem multiplayer is kill already, (4000 people in game, 1 online game being hosted) lessons from HWR learned\n\nI'll still recommend it, just for the story.","January 22","true","41.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Musics, Art, Ambience and especially Background story... all are perfect.\nI read the Backline Story of Homeworld years ago. In these days I was dreaming a new Homeworld game which may takes place in these days (Heresy Wars or advanture of finding Guide Stone). Thanks again for giving us (Fans) this game.\nI hope to see new Homeworld Game(s) in close future.

I get so excited when I call in a massive airstrike or send in a cruiser squad.\n\nCons:\nVery short solo campaign\nCombat feels like rock paper scissors sometimes\nMultiplayer only has 6 maps and 2 game modes\nI personally don't like limited resource games, it's fun to have gamnes drag out for an hour sometimes\n\nConclusion:\nThis game is super fun and I'm glad I bought it. Def got my moneys worth. However I don't see myself putting in 500 hours like some of my other strat/rts games I have, the replayability just isn't there. Although the devs seem like the sort of company who stick with a game and continue to improve/release stuff so I'll be checking back in waiting for content.\n","January 22","true","50.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'll grant this a positive review but only just.\n\nPros:\n- Got all the feels of the original Homeworld (A game that deserves far more praise than it already gets): the music, the style, the fun; it's all there.\n- A great lore expansion from the already enormous universe.\n- Just as simple a contrustion mechanic as ever.\n- Two fascinating new, complete factions.\n\nCons:\n- Rather dull designs for the new factions, each being practically identical except for the Carrier itself.\n- Slightly reptitive missions and CONSTANT lack of resources.\n- Doesn't even begin to match the scale of the originals both geographically and militarily.\n\nAll in all, it is a good game, it just doesn't quite make the Homeworld name.\n\nNewcomers to the franchise and those strong enough to not think about the originals are going to love it.\nThe rest of us however, are going to have to suffer the mild disappointment that comes with this new look on an ancient legend.","February 1","true","7.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

At first I was a bit skeptical. But since I have loved the other Homeworld titles I got the pre-order. Jumped into the story and wow! A lot better then I was expecting. The visuals and gameplay are very well done. The story is great so far. You still get that Homeworld feeling while playing. A must have for Homeworld and RTS fans.\n\nMy only complant is the bad AI in skirmish mode.
