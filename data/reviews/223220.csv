The player controls Giana as she searches for her sister Maria who has been kidnapped in the Dream World by a dragon. This provides the simple impetus for Giana's journey through The Dream World which she has the ability to manipulate shifting her persona between a cute girly girl that inhabits a halloween inspire iteration of the dream world and an edgier punk chick who traverses a variation of the Dream world that is more colorful and cheery. Giana's personas also have different special abilities. The cutesy Giana has a graceful twil jump that allows her to glide through the air over extended distances while the punk Giana can launch herself forward as a fireball. Swapping between these personas and mixing up moves to traverse the environment in integral to surviving Giana. The persona shifting in Giana Twisted Sisters is similar to the time shifting mechanic in Sonic CD except that it can be performed on the fly and you are in no way limited to how often or how many times you can shift.\n\nBlack Forest Games does a commendable job making the most of this gameplay mechanic. The shifting mechanic also adds a puzzle element to the game. Figuring out which sisters maneuvers will allow you to best proceed through an area is the central puzzle theme. It's fast paced and never leaves you scratching your head for long but keeps you mentally engaged with your surroundings. Platforms will apprear in one dimension that don't appear in another, platforms move in a certain direction with one persona while moving in another with the opposite persona, enemies change completely requiring one persona to defeat the enemy while the other can use the defeated enemy as a traversal tool... There is almost always something new in Giana Sisters\n\nWhile Giana Sisters starts as a cakewalk the difficulty ramps up quickly as you are required to shift dozens of times to complete small stretches of levels. Some areas require you to cacoon yourself in bubble gun and float through razor sharp crystals, others require you to run through a gauntlet of obstacles while being chased by a wall of fire. Boxes can be pushed to create raised platforms and some levels have a more open design that require Giana to collect several keys in an undetermined order to open a passageway to a new area. These challenges are remixed and recycled into devilish combinations late in the game.\n\nIt's backdrops are colorful and layered with detail. The juxtaposition between the dimensions is natural and entirely seemless. It is easy to spend time shifting between dimensions in some areas just to see how objects in one dimension are translated in the other dimension. Large hollowed out tree trunks in the cheery dimension become massive reptilian skulls, wells become rotted tree stumps, owls become horned demons... Texture resolutions are high and effects for things like water are far from generic with cloudy patches and bubbles. It is unfortunate that most of the same elements are reused for much of the game. Assests from the first level are found in great abundance in later stages and while I appreciate a 2D platformer that doesn't fall into fire, ice and desert level cliches, a greater degree of variety would have been appreciated.\n\nWhile perhaps one of the most obscure franchises to be resuscitated in recent memory Giana Sisters proves itself to be a worthwhile and enjoyable experience. It's colorful, challenging, and makes excellent use of a handful of mechanics. It is perhaps the best mix of platforming puzzles and reflex based gameplay on the market. While the limited soundtrack and small pool of art assets can make the last portion of the game a little less invigorating than the first, it does little to take away from the excellent gameplay. If you have conquered Donkey Kong and saved princess Peach a dozen times from the clutches of Bowser than it's time you considered shifting through Dream Land as teenage hero Giana.","November 25, 2013","true","10.7"," 73 of 87 people (84%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","84","73","87","0","2"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/recommended/223220/","mrninjasquirrel","MrNinjaSquirrel","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mrninjasquirrel/","1478 products in account","For a game billing itself as a retro platformer, Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams almost seems to go out of its way to break the mold that has formed out of such a rapidly populating genre. Shunning away from its restrictively minimalistic, outrageously challenging and graphically simplistic peers, it preserves and refines the classic platformer gameplay while giving it a modern face life. Giana Sisters is one of the most visually impressive games the genre has ever seen, but it's when you combined its looks with how well it plays that it becomes something really special.\n\nAlthough I wouldn't call minimalistic, Giana Sisters is certainly a pure platformer. The difference between the two which I feel is important to define, is that the former is intentionally designed to be basic to the largest degree possible, while the later takes the fundamental gameplay of the genre and doesn't add extra systems or mechanics because it doesn't need to to be fun. This is one of Giana Sisters biggest strengths and one of the reason it feels like a classic platformer from the 8 and 16-bit days but with all the benefits of current technology, and not simply a game designed to emulate the era.\n\nThe one additional mechanic to the typical running, jumping and dodging of any platformer is the world switching of the two sisters. With the press of a button you can shift between them, going from the lighthearted and colorful environment of the first to the hellish nightmare of the second. Both the music and graphics drastically change between the two, an effect that is incredibly cool to witness, but alternating between worlds also plays into the gameplay with certain platformers and machines only appearing and functioning in one or the other, as well as certain objects reversing direction or their entire physical property. It sounds more complicated than it actually is and takes only moments to grasp when you see it in action, but is used intelligently in conjuncture with the other obstacles in the game to test your skills and reflexes without resulting to cheap level designs or traps.\n\nI should probably point out that yes, this is a very difficult game, but it isn't that way right from the start. The challenge is a gradual slope and it wasn't until the last handful of levels that I felt it was seriously demanding. Checkpoints are plentiful and there is no penalty when you die, both of which make this a rather accessible game even for those usually scared off from supposedly "hardcore" platformers. If it proves too easy there are several additional difficulty levels some of which are quite frankly ridiculously brutal in design, and conversely if you find you can't handle the normal levels an easy mode has since been patched in for those that want to enjoy the game without risking an aneurysm.\n\nIf there is one thing that sets Giana Sisters apart from everything else though, it would be the astounding presentation. The graphics are stunning, with textures bursting with detail and color, and impressive water and lighting effects complimenting the great ascetic design (which is even more impressive when you consider there are technically two renditions of object, enemy and environment in the game, one for each of the sisters' worlds). Animations are immaculate, especially the transitions when you swap sisters and have the world transform around you. The soundtrack jointly composed by  Chris HÃ¼lsbeck and Swedish metal band Machinae Supremacy, each playing their own arrangement of the same track, is simply amazing and like everything else switches seamlessly as you swap sisters, creating a very memorable and original sound that is worth the price of admission by itself.\n\nThe only thing Giana Sisters manages to falter with is variety. While I enjoyed everything about the game it didn't take very long before I felt like I was running in place, replaying the same level with a few minor tweaks that were hardly noticeable in the grand scheme of things. You are essentially dodging the same enemies and traps the entire game, with only the exact placement of them changing slightly from level to level. This problem is extrapolated by each level taking anywhere from 10-15 minutes to complete, a length that begins to drag after a point and had me wishing for more numerous but shorter levels that I could better apportion for prolongation consumption.\n\nGiana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is perhaps the best example yet that the classic platformer is not dead but merely neglected and misunderstood. Although it doesn't hold up well for extended play, for bite sized sessions it is still a great deal of fun. The soundtrack is marvelous (and I don't even like metal traditionally) and everything polished to a degree that sets a new standard for indie developers. If my overly enthusiastic hyperbole hasn't convinced you that this is worth your time I'm not sure what will, but just know that you'll be missing out on a great game if you decide to pass this up.\n\nBuy it, play it, love it; you can thank me later.\n\nYou can read more of my writing on Kritiqal[kritiqal.com].","February 10, 2014","true","7.6"," 53 of 62 people (85%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","85","53","62","0","1"

Each sister has a special ability (fireball and twirl) that you have to use to make your way through levels.  You will find checkpoints along the way that you will return to after dying, which you will do a lot.  There's plenty of secret areas to find and lots of little crystals to collect, though their only purpose is to determine how many stars you are rewarded for completing the level (the purpose of which is to unlock the boss levels and if you score high enough on every level, hardcore mode.  Good luck with that.)\n\nThis game has a wonderful aesthetic.  When you switch characters, the world around to morphs to match the personality of the sister you are currently controlling and the music changes with it.  The music is really well done and switches seamlessly between styles.  Unfortunately that's really the only good thing about the game.\n\nGiana Sisters starts out fun and fresh introducing you to the world.  You'll quickly discover the controls leave something to be desired, especially the fireball which has a habit of rocketing you towards an enemy just slightly out of range, then ending one pixel before hitting it so you instantly die.  Puzzles rapidly become more complex and deathtraps start appearing everywhere while the checkpoints get further apart and before you know it the game has become a trial-and-error exercise in frustration.  I stopped enjoying the game about halfway through but I slogged through the rest to see if it got any better.  It didn't.\n\nI find it hard to recommend this game since there's a lot of better platformers out there that aren't nearly as frustrating.","February 7, 2013","false","8.7"," 60 of 85 people (71%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","71","60","85","0","7"

The level designs are sharp, colorful and brilliantly rendered. If I were to make a comparison, this is hand to hand with Trine series.\n\nThe essence of precision platformer is here, you make mistakes - you die as you only have limited lives. There's no need to use weapons, you only need to jump to pawn or evade the incoming attacks. More often than not you need to swap to your twisted reality, either to proceed or to get around enemies. Throughout the levels you'd required to collect the gems that influence your ratings in that particular level. Collecting gems, however, is not necessary to win - it's just a bonus challenge. At the end of the every world levels, there are a boss waiting. Bosses usually a challenge in a platformer, and in Giana they're indeed a challenge. Bosses have an attack patterns, that sometimes agonizingly require precise timing to evade yet necessary to win. I can't count how many I have to restart just in the first boss stage.\n\nThat said, the difficulty as a whole had been a subject of discussion since seemingly many players only want to win the game in a reasonable time. The Developers listened and added an easy mode to address the issue - hence the easy mode.\n\nThe game contains other mode than normal campaign. You can play to beat your own score (Time Attack mode), to Uber Hardcore that every time you die, you return to level one (how hardcore can you be?). A very good added value in my opinion.\n\nFinally, as a platformer, people prefer to play with gamepad. Game supports even dinput - it recognizes my Rumblepad 2 and assigns the buttons without problem. Good stuff.\n\nNow for the recommendation.... the game appears to be on sale quite often. 50% is a VERY good value, even at full price. 75% off is a steal, more than that... uber mega steal?\n\n9/10 score.","December 28, 2013","true","74.3"," 36 of 49 people (73%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","73","36","49","0","1"

(I sure wish I did.)\n\nI really like platformers and bought Giana Sisters to get more of that goodness as it looked gorgeous. At first I thought it was an okay game, but soon I grew really tired of it.\n\nThe main gimmick of Giana Sisters is switching between light and dark world. You can switch whenever and wherever at will. The switch mechanic feels forced, artificial and really out of place. You have to keep constantly switching thorough stages and sometimes in a split-second timing to avoid a deathtrap. Take a look at Trine. It has the switch system done right. You have 3 different characters and almost always you also have 3 ways to approach the stages. Sometimes you didn't have to switch characters in a stage at all. In Giana Sisters there is always only one way and it will require switching and numerous times at that.\n\nThe stages get really long  and tiresome quickly. There is too little variance. It almost feels like you were playing the same stage over and over again.\n\nMy last complaint is the fact that the game is in "2,5D". It would have worked a lot better in pure 2D as it is sometimes hard to see deathtraps because of the foreground objects or camera angle, which cannot be changed. 2,5D also causes bugs and glitches. I have got stuck inside solid platforms more than once without any hope to get out. Once just before the goal.\n\nThis platformer lover is disappointed.","January 1, 2014","false","9.9"," 91 of 145 people (63%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","63","91","145","3","2"

Sadly, the gameplay is some of the most frustrating, rage inducing I've had the misfortune to experience. This is due to the controls not being responsive enough for the kind of pixel perfect jumps and split second timed trap sequences that fill each level. Or at least, not with a keyboard. For example, the number of times I was holding two arrow keys to dash diagonally, only to go straight up into an instant death trap. Also not helped by the save system. Its no good having checkpoints every 2 minutes, if you still have to start a level from the beginning if you decide to (rage)quit the game entirely. This forces you to press on through building frustration. And its especially painful on the ridiculously insane boss fights, which come at the end of a 30 minute level.

Difficulty is very much non-optional. It is straight descendant of old school platformers. No story. No puzzles. Basically purely mad dashing around to avoid various deadly hazards, often timed, with some limited branching off exploration. It breaks off the old schoolness by having checkpoints and lack of lives system, you can die any number of times you please (or can live with, no pun intended). But basically you play to get better, and unlock even harder and harder modes/challenges, and for that you actually do not want to die to do any good. Which culminates in the definetely hardest difficulty setting where you have one life to rule them all in a single playtrough.\n\nIt may be not that hard as game like Super Meat Boy, however SMB has more modern approach to difficulty, while Giana Sisters features long levels and doesn't even feature quick restart after you know you â¥â¥â¥â¥ed up your challenge because of a death.\n\nHowever, if you accept dying a lot, and therefore pretty much abandon the harder modes, it is manageable even without the easy mode (more checkpoints and some slight changes in levels to make them easier), at least until the definitely final boss.\n\nSo yeah, this is pretty much all about murdering and torturing little girls in a dream world, and you play as one, die as one.. a lot. So not really dreams, nightmares rather, which is even accentuanted by how the cute version of you is trapped in a dark, grim world, whereas the punk version is stuck in a cotton candy fluffy cute world.

Foreground and background layers in some areas are designed to look like they have their own platforms and levels in them, and the same design motifs and objects as the main layer, without actually tricking you into thinking they're usable. The camera zooms in and out as appropriate without getting in the way. Each level is decorated with a variety of objects which shift seamlessly between two worlds. You gotta see it in action to appreciate it.\n* The platforming is very good. Your two special abilites both control well and are used to their full potential constantly, along with traditional platforming skills. New gameplay elements are added at a steady pace. Difficult at times without being frustrating, at least on normal mode.\n* The dark world/light world mechanic is explored fully, and is used at virtually every step along the way while rarely feeling forced. Enemy behavior, moving platforms, walls, gems, everything is tied to it.\n* Levels are huge and full of secret areas.\n* Two great soundtracks which shift back and forth in a very satisfying way as you play, again reinforcing the dual world mechanic.\n\nCons:\n* In some cases it can be hard to recognize obstacles that can hurt you in one or both worlds, especially thorny vines which are deadly in one world but recede in the other. Also, the light world's "deadly water" color looks very similar to the color of water you can swim in, leading me to occasionally mistake one for the other.\n* The bosses are a frustrating test of your patience. You have to survive a set number of attacks with only 2 HP until you can hit them. I think it's 9 attacks for the second boss and a whopping 15 for the third boss. Each attack will be something you can dodge *most* of the time, but they're all slow and have long buildups and pauses between them, and if you mess up twice you gotta start all over. A shame, since their attacks are actually creative and fun to dodge... if the whole process wasn't so slow and reset-prone.\n* The amazing graphics do require a decent system. If you have an older computer or graphics card, be sure to download the demo and try it first.","November 3, 2015","true","10.7"," 8 of 10 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","8","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/recommended/223220/","atratzu","Atratzu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/atratzu/","180 products in account","-Quick Review-\nGiana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is a platformer based game where you switch between two different modes of combat/movement.\n-Detailed breakdown review-\nStory:  Oh no, a dragon/dinosaur-thing swallowed your sister. Now you need to go through twenty three levels and pull your hair out as you struggle to beat the bosses. Thankfully the game offers you different difficulties to play through the game; if you not enjoying your time you can dumb it down to Easy so you can at least get through the game. Although I found myself dead often even on easy. How much fun is that, I had flashbacks to Super Meat Boy.\n\nGame Play: As my brother said âIt looks like a very generic platformerâ and that sums it up pretty well. I havenât played a platformer that I enjoyed since Sonic the Hedgehog and Mario. I got through the game but Iâm going to move on to something Iâm more naturally good at playing become I come back and try to grind my way to perfection to get the tough achievements. (ha ha, jokes on you game, I donât think Iâll come back until Iâve ran out of video games in the world)\nAs a whole, the game play isnât âbadâ per-say, I think anyone who enjoys platformers would enjoy this game, the controls are pretty tight, so when I died I knew it was my fault, not the games. So I guess thatâs what a platformer should do. But I would like a few extra mistakes before I die.\n\nAchievements: I donât wanna talk about those this time. I earned half of them by playing though the game; the other half will come from conquering this game, and beating ultra-uber-hardcore-mode. Kudos to whomever actually gets those achievements legitimately (hereâs looking at you, kid whoâs using trainers or hacks.)\n\nPrice: Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreamsâ non-sale price is $14.99, I spent a lot of time struggling with this game, so when it comes to time spent in game, thatâs a fair price. But there is a demo (that Iâm sure will take you through the first 5 levels which are extremely fun and fast paced. Itâs everything after that, that makes my fingers cry) Iâd recommend trying out the demo before you buy, but like said; if you already love platformers, youâll probably get a lot of enjoyment out of this game.\n\nConclusion: As Iâve clearly indicated, this is a good game, but annoyingly difficult for someone like me who cannot do perfect on a platformer. I recommend this game to anyone who already knows they like platformers. (I do play platformers on a keyboard, so as always, maybe thatâs why I struggle so much)\nIâm going to go curse at the humblebundle for giving me a platformer, Iâve learned my lesson. No more platformers for Atratzu. Excuse me while I go whine more in the corner.","May 21, 2014","true","10.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","3","3","0","0"

Over the course of that time I've only had the heart to play a few hours, on and off through about a dozen or so times.  I am a â¥â¥â¥â¥ for platformers, but Giana Sisters is a bore, and simply not enjoyable.  It took me a long time to put my finger on it, and I'll lay out my problems with it, here, in case anyone is reading this.\n1.)The graphics are VERY poorly optimized.  I have a fairly decent rig, and even at 1280x720 the framerate and textures are abysmal for me.\n2.)The controls feel really bad.  A good game (like Mario, or Super Meat Boy) makes you feel like death is your fault for a lack of skill.  Half my deaths in Giana Sisters feel like it's the controls fault. It's hard to describe, but you know it when you play it.\n3.) The collect-a-thon of gems.  It seems entirely pointless.  I had absolutely no incentive to explore and collect gems.  If they were used for something (lives, or a minimum to move on to the next level), but as it stands, unless you're nuts about collecting stuff, gems are useless.  Not to mention, it doesn't fit thematically ... you're off to rescue your sister, so why waste your time getting money and shiz?\n4.) The story is generic and boring, but that's just opinion.\n5.) The music is so vapid, and trying too hard to be grandiose, and becomes generic very quick.\n6.) There are about 6 lame enemy types in the whole game.  *yawn*\n\nI dunno ... I'm boring myself just thinking about it.  Everything this game does, Super Mario Bros. 3, and dozens and dozens of other games do better, so go get those.\nGood luck.","July 21, 2014","false","5.1"," 23 of 42 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","23","42","0","0"

It sports increasingly challenging level making use of the core mechanic; dual world that can change how enemies and the environment behaves around you.\n\nThe game is so cutesy, it must be easy! Hint: It is notAlthough the game starts simple and easy it soon becomes one of the most difficult platforming games with long levels full of secret paths leading to more gems, which you will need to explore if you wish to earn the best rank.\n\nAfter a point in the game you'll realize it became much more difficult and the game isn't as simple as you may have thought. Sure it went easy on you, but once the hard levels start popping up don't expect to see any other easy coming as a breather.\n\nPlatformer that requires precision requires good controlsAnd Giana Sisters delivers it. The controls feel amazingly smooth and responsive and the glitches are few between none.\n\nThere is ONE problem with it, though: the floating bubblegum. You have few levels that requires the usage of it and the controls are so sensitive and floaty that the slightest miscalculation will send you into a wall or an enemy and possibly to your demise.\n\nThe difficultyGiana Sisters: Twisted Dreams will not disappoint those seeking for a challenge having several difficulty levels, but you must earn the right to play them first.\n\nYou have Hardcore (no checkpoints, mind that some levels are quite long) and even Ãber Hardcore (one death and it's Game Over).\n\nHowever people who are looking for simpler, less difficult game can always opt for the Easy difficult which adds one thing or two to avoid instant death and removes some of the nastier tricks in each stage.\n\nAmazing soundtrackThe music is dissonant in-game: you'll hear a heavy remix as punk Giana while having cute graphics and a much more relaxed tune while as cute Giana while having a nightmarish background. The music itself? Amazing is one word to describe it.\n\nFinishing upOverall Giana Sisters: Twisted Dream is a very original and satisfying game which will certainly please anyone who gets past it's "cutesy" cover.","November 27, 2013","true","29.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The common usage of power-ups is left behind when everything is unlocked from the very beginning. Instead it's your way of playing that has to evolve in sync with the gradually higher difficulty on later levels.Twisted Dreams brings back an unlikely product of a derivative time and gives it unique life. It's a positive early argument for Kickstarter revivals and while it still works in known quantities, it provides a hellishly difficult and sweet platformer that finally provides a non-ironic reason to enjoy the Giana Sisters.","December 31, 2013","true","9.9"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

The ultimate feature of this game - two charaters, who can be changed at your will during level progress. Different characters mean different gameplay and different level features. Red-hair sister posseses fire dash ability, yellow-hair one - slow descent. Combining those two abilities is vitality for level progress. As for level features, it is represented by some walkthrough changes, for example, if you are playing for red one - there will be harmless turtle in the pond, but for yellow-haired sister this turtle would be displayed as deadly piranha.\n\nA few words of graphic style: it's wonderful. Level is existing in two dimensions: fairy tale and a bit spooky haunted place (forest, castle etc.). 3-D background is great. Designers put a lot of effort in it.\n\nMusic is great too. Aggressive, fast riffs by Machinae Supremacy  and calm melodies by Chris HÃ¼lsbeck create a wonderful cocktail for your ears. I can say, that you definitely will add some tracks to your playlist or gadget.\n\nSo. GS: TD is great, awesome and cost only 12$ for a bundle? Are you still hesitating?

Art style is great, but every now and then a foreground object gets in front of a hazardous object. And you die from it. So the camera angles and foreground objects needed work. The visuals also work against it from time to time, having to swap dimensions to avoid certain hazards, sometimes one or two will blend in with the world transforming, so you may not see it until you get hit by it.\n\nControls are clunky, your default attack runs out but keeps the momentum of movement, often causing you to die to an enemy just out of reach that the game forced you to attack.

The ability to switch between the two sisters with the press of a button and drastically alter the environment in the process is a seamlessly implemented mechanic that helps differentiate it from others in the genre. Makes it a fresh experience while maintaining a traditional feel. Stunning artwork with an excellent and detailed contrast between Light and Dark dimensions. More environment variety would've been welcomed since a few of the backdrops tend to reappear often throughout the game. Same goes for the sountrack, which is solid but gets a bit stale after the first couple hours.\n\nGamepad controls are precise and responsive, and considering how difficult Giana Sisters is, you'll need them to be. Enemies and traps can take you out with one hit and some sequences tend to feel like trial-and-error. Thankfully the checkpoint system is usually generous enough to alleviate most of your frustrations.\n\nOverall, a gorgeous, fun and fresh 2D platformer. It has a traditional old-school feel that's both welcoming and comforting, but also offers some unique mechanics to shake things up and keep you interested.","February 15, 2013","true","10.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The platforming action starts out simple, yet reaches moderately challenging levels once you have a good grasp of the gameplay mechanics.  The controls are tight and wonderfully executed, meeting the perfect balance of not being too airy or weighty.   The visuals do their job well enough, offering colorful landscapes and level features as well as dark and menacing places filled with demon-like enemies.  The game's polarity mechanic enhances the gameplay by changing the form of the level depending on which side of the level you are on beyond the aesthetic, sometimes opening areas that were closed or inaccessable on the other side of the level.  This keeps the level design fresh and always leads you to finding parts of the level you may not have even noticed or otherwise accessed before.  The soundtrack is outstanding, switching between the compositions of Chris HÃ¼lsbeck; who composed the original game to an intense metal soundtrack done by Machinae Supremacy.  The transitions in terms of graphics, gameplay and sound between the two forms of the level are smooth and the game is not afraid to keep challenging you.","December 20, 2012","true","7.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

The ultimate feature of this game - two charaters, who can be changed at your will during level progress. Different characters mean different gameplay and different level features. Red-hair sister posseses fire dash ability, yellow-hair one - slow descent. Combining those two abilities is vitality for level progress. As for level features, it is represented by some walkthrough changes, for example, if you are playing for red one - there will be harmless turtle in the pond, but for yellow-haired sister this turtle would be displayed as deadly piranha.\n\nA few words of graphic style: it's wonderful. Level is existing in two dimensions: fairy tale and a bit spooky haunted place (forest, castle etc.). 3-D background is great. Designers put a lot of effort in it.\n\nMusic is great too. Aggressive, fast riffs by Machinae Supremacy  and calm melodies by Chris HÃ¼lsbeck create a wonderful cocktail for your ears. I can say, that you definitely will add some tracks to your playlist or gadget.\n\nSo. GS: TD is great, awesome and cost only 12$ for a bundle? Are you still hesitating?

Each world grants you unique powers and has its own graphics, animations and music. The transition between these dimensions is seamless. Each will change pathways, platforms and deadly environmental objects.  These mechanics aren't an afterthought; they're flawlessly executed and the very essence of the game.\n\nIt'll hold your hand for a few tutorialish levels then quickly jerk you into reality, getting more brutal and demanding of your timing, precision and use of world switching with each level.  Fortunately, checkpoints are generous pre-hardmodes and the game has now implemented an easy difficulty, which is roughly equivalent to normal in most other games.\n\nGreat soundtrack, beautiful, achievements, and native 360 support.","October 26, 2012","true","14.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","7"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/stewiesnake/recommended/223220/","stewiesnake","TGrG","http://steamcommunity.com/id/stewiesnake/","319 products in account","A wonderful 2.5D platformer, with gorgeous aesthetics; visuals and music. The backbone of the gameplay is the dual-world mechanic, which is accessed by switching between the two sisters. Switching changes the level slightly, by unlocking new areas, opening or closing doors, creating or destroying traps. In order to progress and get gems (because it's always about gems), the player is required to learn how to handle the switch quickly and efficiently.\n\nEach of the sisters has her own style. The switch of the music from spooky castle to punk rock is extremely appealing and while the game does often provide the frustrations that are standard for the platform genre, it's never particularly unfair toward the player. Controls are tight -tighter than most platfomers- though a gamepad is recommended simply for enhanced experience.\n\nIt's the best platformer I've played in years and I would recommend to every fan of the genre. The only downside I can think of is that there is nothing here for those who aren't fans of platformer games to change their mind.","March 9","true","3.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Break on through. Listen to my words baby, and see Iâm telling the truth. In this remake of ancient platform game of dreams and dimensions, you will find Giana trying to save her sister Maria, who is held captive by a giant dragon man. What has he done to Gianaâs sister? She is being ravaged and plundered and he ripped her and bite her. We want to save her, and save her now!\n\nGame is published by Black Forest Games. They did a great job. They light the fire baby, and took it higher than ever before. This remake goes over the moon and back, just to see those happy faces we love so much. When I was a kid of very young age, I got Giana Sisters from my dad. I love you dad, I want to hug you. When I was playing it, I could feel how my spirit went away happily singing. Now it has returned. While I travelled this far without my spirit; I feel like a child, like a flower, floating in the breeze man, to have the chance to play this game again. The reaction I get now, thinking about it, looking back, is the game is leaping to my soul. I got to spread the love man.\n\nHello I love you, wonât you tell me your name. Hello I love you, let me jump in your game. Too bad this game doesnât have multiplayer. Itâs the only negative vibe Iâm getting man. Giana has two personas, the cute and punk. If I would say to you girl, just press jump and you can experience the doors of perception, would you take me higher? If you say no, Iâm going to feel unwanted and strange. When youâre strange no one remembers your name.

It has great platforming elements where you switch between two sisters, one being subtle and cute in her ways and the other taking a more hands-on approach and more punk-ish. Frustratingly hard at many times (The "easy" mode is the same level of difficulty as other games in "normal" mode), but one can't deny its charm. Lots of replayability if you consider yourself a completionist. The controls can get iffy at times (mostly because you press a button and don't land exactly where you want, causing you to die) but thankfully there are enough checkpoints in the levels to compensate for that.

It's colorful, looks great and plays fine with a controller, too. The character you control can switch between two realms on-the-fly; one is a happy, colorful world, the other one is a dark, twisted world. You'll have to switch between these world in order to progress, while collecting gems as well.\n\nNote that these gems are important. Normally I wouldn't have mentioned them but since I see it as a design flaw I have to bring it up anyway. There are some levels where you need to have a certain amount of stars (gained by collecting gems and not dying) before you can play them. If it's something I hate (not always by the way, it depends on the game/challenge), it is working for my game. I play games to relax, I *don't* want games to tell me I can't play a certain level because I didn't feel like collecting everything. It makes me want to stop playing it altogether.\nSo... that's what I did.\nBut if you don't mind all that this might just be for you.\n\n[Rating: 73/100]","October 28, 2012","true","3.9"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","1"

And with all things considered, the world-swapping mechanic which is lauded by the game's description & other reviews is not much more than a gimmick, and you'll be hard-pressed to remember much about the game after you're done with it.\n\nYou may also have trouble finishing the last 1/3rd of the game because at that point, as the recycled art assets, music, and enemies will start to become pretty monotonous. And the last boss -- which is where I quit playing the game -- was also very poorly-designed and frustrating because waiting for it to go through its sequence of moves took forever. I counted, and whenever you respawn the boss takes around 15 seconds to begin his first attack. And the maximum time it took in-between attacks in his sequence was 26 seconds. It all adds up and you'll get frustrated from the boredom of waiting, rather than from it being difficult.\n\nI'm putting specific emphasis on the boss because I honestly can't remember a whole lot about the game (the boss is fresh in my mind right now), and it ruined any little sense of momentum I had in the last few levels. It really does become a blur of tedium towards the end, and the mandatory-to-progress "Collectathon" aspect of the game especially wore thin by then.\n\nWith that, the "Rise of the Owlverlord" expansion was actually really good. I initially went into it with extreme reluctance because of how mind-numbing the original game was, but I had a great time with it. The level design was interesting and varied, and had a much speedier pace due to the design and being able to bum-rush them since a collectable-quota was not required to progress. The boss was also enjoyable and challenging. Took me about 50 minutes to beat the 7 levels.\n\nOverall, I'd stay clear of this game though, since there are much, much better platformers out there.","November 27, 2014","false","7.3"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

The graphical style is nice, the dual world mechanic with 2 playable characters you can switch out at any time is a good feature but the gameplay is just dull.\n\nMy biggest frustration with it by far is that the levels are too long.  They are not interesting enough to play through and the 2 types of enemies I encountered in the first 6 levels are brainless jump pads.  To fill out the unnecessarily large levels you have hundreds of gems to collect, they are everywhere and as Iâm not someone that enjoys heavy lashings of collectibles in games this just added to the tedium.\nAdd in a poor checkpoint system and I gave up by the end of the first world (6 levels in).  Not because I found it too hard, I just found it boring.\n\nHalf the level size, shrink the collectibles down to a handful (or keep the hundreds of gems but add something else more meaningful to collect in much smaller numbers) and give the enemies more character (from my experience of the first world that I played). That in my opinion would give you a tighter, more enjoyable experience.\n\nFor reference I would say Super Mario World is the best 2D platformer ever made.  Meatboy and the rayman Origins are right up there too.  I bring this up because as much as I loved Rayman Legends, the games âmore is betterâ style with the lums was very off putting to me.

The mechanics are unique, but don't feel gimmicky. The controls are fluid and intuitive. The graphics are gorgeous. The  difficulty is perfect, and relies on well constructed challenges, rather than feeling unfair; it can be very frustrating when a game feels like it's 'cheating', and that doesn't happen here.\n\nThe only criticism I have of the game is that the checkpoints are not saved when you exit the game, meaning that if you get stuck halfway through a level, you have to persevere until you beat it unless you want to start that level from the beginning.\n\nIf you like the expansion, then this is a no brainer. If you haven't played either, but like challenging platformers, I strongly recommend you give one of these a go.","June 26, 2014","true","12.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Do not even try without a pad.\n\nGiana is a game of three tricks: spinning slowfall (as yellow) fireball jump (as red) and colour switching (twists the world so that some platforms become accessible or traps become disabled) and, of course, jumping.  All you need is to master to use a proper trick in a proper place and a proper time. There is no healthbar. First mistake and Giana is dead (unless she has a shield gem, two mistakes in this case), You are going to die, a lot. Fortunaltely at lower difficulties, there are 'infinite lives' and quite frequent checkpoints. Hardcore is one live per level (no checkpoints). Uber hardcore is one live per the game (death = restart from level 1),\n\nThe whole design is about two parallel world: Yellow's Nightmare (dark, grim and gloomy) and Red's 'Nightmare' (cheerful, sunny, a fairty tale, think of My Little Ponny). Both worlds are even accompanied by different interpretations of the same tune: played as instrumental or as a rock.\nI am utmostly impressed how did the authors manage to design world shifting in such a natural a way.\n\nGiana looks somehow childlish in both versions, enemies and the environment look more funny then scary, even in the Yellow's Nightmare.  The locations are rather limited: forrest, cave, castle, underwater, but all of them come in two versions: a nightmare and cheerful.\n\nApprox 24 levels to go (plus bonus levels), Later they can can take several hours per level to complete (depends on your symbioss with the pad). Marvelous gallery can be unlocked.\n\nDo not play, if You:\n* don't like to die (a lot)\n* don't like childish graphics\n\nDo play, if:\n* love challenges","September 26, 2014","true","19.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

Accompanied by a group of pet stooges, they go up in arms against everyone showing their dissatisfaction with the complete lack of palpable progress and broken promises.\n\nDue to false advertising and the lying developer that is unable to admit their mistakes and treating paying customers like crap, I would strongly suggest to avoid buying the game, or anything else the studio has made, or will ever make.\n\nOn a side note, there was probably nothing else to expect from a series that always openly took pride in being a shameless knockoff from its very start.\n\nUpdate as of 07/17/15:\nI wasn't following the game for half a year, but, expectedly so, the situation has not progressed in the slightest. Furthermore, the developer is now admitting they have no reason to port the game to Linux at this point, since everyone who trusted their earlier promises already purchased it:\n"we are aware that a lot of people already "own" linux version and are just waiting for the release, so we are not expecting that the linux version will suddenly bring in half a million new sales. //BFG Zyddie"\nThe confidence game is becoming more and more apparent.","January 2, 2015","false","0.1"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

This game certainly has some of the charm of the original, but there are too many flaws in it for me to recommend it.\n\nThe world changing mechanics are a nice idea, but they are confusing and too underdeveloped to feel intuitive. When standing on a platform you often change the world and the platform disappears, sending you falling making you do the same platforming segment again and again. I don't have a problem with the platforms disappearing as such. I have a problem with the visual clues not being clear enough. How am I supposed to know if a platform will disappear or not? The visual clues are there, but they are so damn subtle that when you are playing a hectic segment, you just fail, fail, fail and fail again. Very frustrating. It's a general problem with the game. The graphic style is all over the place. So many colors everywhere and so many layers that you just can't tell what is going on. It's the same problem I had with the latest Red Alert game. It lost focus and became this color infested mess of a design that you almost couldn't tell your units apart. Same for this game. Often times you die from falling in "acid" because you thought it was water. And often you land on a spike and die, even though some of the crystals you pick up are very spiky. Signals are so mixed! And with the world changing looks all the time it just gets even more confusing.\n\nAnyways, it's certainly not a bad game by a long shot, meaning that I actually like the gameplay when I take it extremely slow. I'm just so disappointed that they didn't think of these things. Or maybe they did and they just ended up working so long on the game that they couldn't see the flaws anymore. It happens.

This is like old school platformer difficulty, where you will die repeatedly. Its kinda like mario bros, but its different enough to come into its own. Not much of a story but with this type of game thats, not what its about. Real soild controls, with full controller support. Its cool how you can switch between sisters on the fly and how everything changes. The backrounds change, the music changes and their powers change. My only complaint would be that you die alot, but you do have infinite lives. A really good platformer with up to date 3D type graphics, that is challanging, but fun.

I really like the idea of two characters with different abilities related to platforming, like Trine in a way, but faster.\n\nThe problem I have, however, is with the controls. A platformer requires tight and extremely responsive controls. This game, as of the time of writing this review, does not have the required responsive controls. It feels like a chore to play the game, especially with the default controls, both when using a keyboard and when using a gamepad (wired or wireless, X360 or XBOne). It's nigh on impossible to accurately control the main character or their abilities and some things like walljumping really just don't work at all most of the time. That's not even speaking of trying to switch characters and abilities mid flight, that's pretty much impossible to do and usually leads to swift impalement on some spikes.\n\nThe game runs quite well on my machine, but then it would be surprising if it didn't, considering the hardware I have in my system. Actually, this may be the issue in some respects, although I can't really fathom why the game would have problems with multiple monitors.\n\nPC Specs:\nCPU: i5-3570K (4x3.3GHz)\nRAM: 32GB DDR3-1600 CL11\nMotherboard: Gigabyte B75M-D3H\nGraphics card 1: Sapphire Radeon HD7950 Boost\nGraphics card 2: Gigabyte HD7790 single fan\nGPU #1 has two monitors attached to it: one 1080p 144Hz display, and one 1050x1680 Dell monitor.\nGPU #2 has four monitors attached to it and is not recognized as the main GPU by the system and should thus not be utilized. Regardless, I'm getting a stable >150fps, so I doubt this GPU is the one that's active (although this is something that happens with Unity games - developers, make sure to give us an option to pick the rendering device or your game may perform like â¥â¥â¥â¥ on a lot of systems!).","December 8, 2015","false","0.5"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The concept of the game is that there are two sisters one of the gets sucked into some mysterious whirlwind thingy and the other sister follows her. That's all you get for the story. During game-play you can alternate between two worlds one where the character looks like a sweet little girl and the other where she looks a Gothic girl, each one with a certain ability. On paper it looks great but it's executed very poorly, there is already a much superior platforming game with a similar system called Guacamalee, I highly recommend it. The jumps aren't very precise for a platforming game and after you stop pressing the direction button the character keeps moving for few frames then makes a stop animation, that gets really annoying after a while and gets you killed a lot. The music is ok at best and very repetitive at most. When the character dies she makes the most annoying death sound you can hear, after a few minutes of playing the game I turned off the character sound.\nI couldn't get myself to finish the game and had to delete it, because there are so many other games that are more worthy of my time.\nSave your money and time for some other game, unless you're an extreme platforming fan, even if you were you might get disappointed.","November 16, 2015","false","2.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Mind buggingly frustrating. Your character is all over the god darn place thanks to the abilities. Maybe it's my fault for trying to play on a keyboard. You misclick you die. You can hardly see some death traps. Everything kills you instantly. You don't even have lives, you just have a death counter that laughs in your face if you even manage to finish the level. If you can't as much as 30 minutes of frustrating gameplay goes to waste, because the game does not save mid-level, so you either finish it or start over.\n\nI give a game what's due: it looks beautiful, watching the background animation while changing your character is amazing, sometimes I stood still on purpose to see what some of the background objects become if you change. The music is also quite good, especially how it changes when you turn into the other character. I also found it funny, that the cute and innocent character has to walk a demonic and ugly plane, while the demonic punk character got a nice and cuddly, beautiful world, where she can destroy stuff. This part of the game is amazingly done.\n\nBasically this is a very nice looking game packed with amazing ideas and exectuted with horrible controls and gameplay.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/recommended/223220/","thetitaniumdragon","TheTitaniumDragon","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thetitaniumdragon/","776 products in account","Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is a 2D platforming game whose central mechanic is the ability to switch between two versions of the same stage â a âlightâ version and a âtwistedâ version. The game is very mechanically simple, with the main character possessing the ability to move, jump, and use one of two double jumps, in addition to the primary mechanic of switching between worlds. While the idea sounds like it has potential, the game exhausts itself of ideas very quickly. The levels of the game are uninspired and quite long, especially given that the game encourages the player to collect every single one of the many, many hundreds of gems scattered across each level. On the whole, the game is very weak and not worth your time or money.\n\nThe gameplay in Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is quite basic. Your character can run, jump, and stomp on enemies to kill them. In addition, your character has two special double jumps â one of them is a jump-twirl, which propels the character upwards an additional distance and allows them to descent at a slower, more controlled rate. The other power is the fireball â your character propels herself a longer distance than the twirl jump in a ball of flame, which can kill enemies you can headstomp on if you hit them with it, regardless of your angle of attack. Both abilities end up heavily utilized â the fireball ability for breaking through walls and bouncing from enemy to enemy, the twirl-jump for navigating several sections of the game â but neither really end up with all that much depth to them. The fireball has the seemingly-neat idea to use it to richochet around off walls, allowing the character to rapidly ascend or descend through narrow passageways, but ultimately, while this seems like a neat idea, it doesnât really end up being all that meaningful.\nThe game takes its name from the ability to âtwistâ the world around you, switching between the light world version and the twisted world version of the level. This doesnât really change the level much, but it does cause some platforms to slide in and out of the wall, some hazards to become dangerous or safe, allow for the collection of differently colored gems, and some doors to open and close. The fireball switches the character to the light world by default, while the jump whirl switches the character to the twisted world; however, even in the midst of using these abilities the player can switch back between worlds. The switching is seamless and the world doesnât change instantaneously in many cases, with platforms and gates taking a short time to slide in and out, and while this is important for a few puzzles, generally it doesnât matter very much.\nUnfortunately, this is all that there is for the vast, vast majority of the game. In the right hands, this might have been interesting, but unfortunately, the game ends up getting pretty boring pretty quickly. The idea of switching between worlds and using the abilities is introduced across the first two stages, and in the rest of the game, only a single new mechanic is ever introduced, and its use is very intermittent.\nThis could have been fine, but unfortunately, the gameâs levels have almost no variation at all. There are spikes which kill the player, spikes which only kill the player in one world or the other, enemies who can be stomped on, enemies who shoot projectiles in a straight line and can be stomped on, and enemies who canât be stomped on at all. There is another uncommon enemy type, which is an enemy which charges at the player when they are stood in front of in the light world, and which hurl ricocheting projectiles at the player in the dark world, as well as ghosts who only pursue the player in one world or the other and who are otherwise invincible (but can be stopped by beams of light, which kill them but primarily serve as a means of preventing the ghosts from pursuing the player into other parts of the level rather than as a means of actually defeating them organically).\nThese limited enemy types are hurt by the level design, which doesnât really introduce many new mechanics at all; there are platforms which rise, fall, or simply fall apart after the player stands on them, and there are arrows which, if the player strikes them with the fireball, launches the player in the direction of the arrow. The levels themselves are not designed in any sort of coherent or aesthetically pleasing manner, with the player making their way through the twisted path of the level, trying to get to the end while just overcoming arbitrary-feeling platforming challenges. I never got any sense of a higher intelligence behind the level designs, and very few of them included anything clever in them at all.\n\nIn games like this, collectables are often used as an incentive to create more replay value. However, this game goes about it wrong in two ways. The first flaw is that the game encourages the player to collect every single gem in each level, both via achievements and via unlocking the boss stages not by merely completing levels, but by completing the levels with enough âstarsâ. Stars are obtained at the end of each level both by collecting arbitrary numbers of gems (the threshold numbers for which vary from stage to stage, and arenât listed anywhere in the game) and by dying a small number of times (which, again, the threshold numbers seem to vary from stage to stage, and arenât listed anywhere in the game). Collecting every single gem in the levels is rather tedious, but not hugely difficult; it is mostly a matter of just finding them. Most of the secrets arenât too badly hidden, with some sort of hint in the level given that there is a secret there, but some of the secrets are hidden in pretty arbitrary places (which, to their credit, I did mostly find, but I didnât really feel like they were being hinted at). One problem was that oftentimes, the âpitsâ werenât actually pits but contained secrets; however, while some of these were marked with gems down at the bottom of the screen, others were unmarked (or, worse yet, featured the âyou will die if you go down this pitâ sign above them, and then, whoops, thereâs a secret down there). This is just bad design; the signs and the gems are supposed to help me.\nMoreover, the gem collection is simply tedious; thereâs no good reason for it. There is another type of collectable â gigantic, glowy gems which were hidden in each level â which were more interesting to find, and had they been the only secrets, they would have been better. Still, which one you were missing was not marked in any clear way, and thus you would have to search the entire (pretty large/long) level to find anything you had missed â probably while playing through the entire stage again.\n\nOverall, the game fails to do anything interesting, and ends up becoming boring and repetitive quite quickly. Thereâs nothing here that hasnât been done much better in other 2D platformers, and even the gameâs presentation isnât very strong. The game feels like it lacks much interesting content, and feels too long for what it actually does have.\nGiana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is worth neither your time nor your money.\n","November 6, 2014","false","13.2"," 2 of 6 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","2","6","0","0"

There are many things done right in this game for the game only to be dragged down from toilet because of few fatal flaws. Let's start with the upsides: The product itself is geared towards hardcore platform game players. The difficulty level can be scaled nicely to cater many preferences. An easier difficulty level has been introduced to the game after its release. That feature add-on is good for clumsier players like me. Easy and normal difficulty levels have abundant checkpoints and you usually don't have to backtrack much if you get killed. Which is kinda nice because you are going to die like 61 times per level when trying to figure out some puzzles. The graphical style fits the theme of the game nicely and the game looks great. Revisiting a legendary franchise for European players who have lived the C64/Amiga age at late 80's and early 90's certainly was the main reason I bought the game. The soundtrack is by 80's/90's computer game music legend Chris Huelsbeck and computer music inspired metal band Machinae Supremacy. When it comes to game theme and setting, you probably can't find better people to arrange music that works with the game.\n\nThen some downsides:  With considerable amount of sudden deaths and the graphical scenery plus style of puzzles being more or less the same for the entire span of the game made the gameplay repetitive. Even with easy difficulty a small amount of puzzles have a bit too much pressing the right button exactly at the same time thing going on, resulting into 10-20 deaths before solving the puzzle. I bought the game not long after it was released. I initially played the game halfway through using normal difficulty level. Then I kinda forgot the game for a year, and only recently I continued playing the game until the final boss using the easy difficulty level. At which moment I gave up. And why?\n\nLet me introduce the game-breaker that ruined the game for me: Somebody responsible for programming and quality testing dropped the ball. When I play the game, most of the time all the surroundings scroll smoothly without FPS drop. However, a TERRIBLE amount of screen stutter that occurs during movement in bigger areas makes playing very annoying. And of course, they are especially present when you are trying to do a combination of quick moves that rely on exact timing, resulting into extra deaths. And when you are trying to beat the final boss in a long-lasting fight and your protection crystals are tight, you'd be really delighted if the the stones needed to deal the damage against the boss didn't mystically disappear half of the time without any obvious reason and warning. After several retries the end result was summary uninstallation of the game.\n\nTL:DR: This game would be easily recommendable if it worked properly. I haven't surveyed how it performs on other computers but I wouldn't be surprised if there are computer systems that are devoid of aforementioned issues. However, I will NOT recommend a game that is potentially uncompleteable depending on your system.","January 18, 2014","false","7.2"," 1 of 4 people (25%) found this review helpful","25","1","4","0","0"

(visuals were nice enough, i noticed some poorly made assets but they are overshadowed by the main mechanic and the soundtrack)\n\n-The problem is that the hitboxes are inconsistent as f***, died many times to hitbox edges outside of spike model. (most noticeable on resized big spikes)\n\n-And the level design seems like a maze, arrows pointing everywhere, secrets that looks like the main path, branching paths that take the players backwards through the level or just wastes time.\n\n-The boss fights have incredibly long animations and half of the time during the fights are just waiting for it attack again, and you have to avoid stuff and not get hit twice while doing so.\n\n-Difficulty is mostly artificial, a common problem in games that try to appeal to oldschool. (a lot of sections are trial and error and avoid touching everything between very far away checkpoints),(you can move and die while the screen fade out and in between lives)\n\n-Dashing, the most enjoyable thing to do, sometimes it just stops right before hitting the enemy making you die, and also randomly decides to home on enemies when you are not aiming to it. (The function to bounce off walls is ultimately useless outside of specific tunnels, most of the time it just kills the player. Even more when the castle level introduces the bumper launcher, in which makes bouncing off the walls in later levels obsolete while including high speed launching outside of said specific tunnels)\n\n-You have to use the launcher to change keybinds, the default keybinds do not include Morph, which is swich world without using character ability button, making the game unplayable on later levels and if the switch worlds is set to manual too.

Im so upset it turned out this way.\n\nIt starts off pretty strong with an interesting art style combined with a nice sound track and a great mechanic. You switch between the two sisters and as you do the level, enimies, and music changes. Each sister also has its own power. However these powers are widley unbalanced. One power is a twirl that allows you to fall slower than normal whiles the other is a fast ball of firey death that can kill enimies, use the as bounce pads, and wall jump. This makes one sister MUCH more fun to play as than the other. I only switch to the other when I had to.\n\nThe other big problem is the story... or lack there of. As it stands I played the entire first section (about six levels) of three sections. The game starts with the sisters being sucked into a portal and one being eaten by a dragon and then all the sudden you can transform into her. Beyond that I have encountered no story (hinted or ortherwise) as of stage 2-1 which is over 1/3rd of the game. I have no reason to keep playing. Nothing is keeping me wanting to learn more.\n\nAnother huge problem is the length of the levels and the complexity. The levels are Entierly to long to the point where they become samey. The art stays the same and the setting just about stays the same so it feels like one giant level. It doesnt help that they never do anything with the mechanics beyond the gem collecting. The mechanics stay VERY simple.\n\nMaybe give the game a try if you like platformers and its on a deep deep discount, but for everyone else this is safe to avoid.","November 30, 2014","false","1.2"," 1 of 5 people (20%) found this review helpful","20","1","5","0","0"

The novelty here is that Giana can switch between a light world (enemies include owls and bunny rabbits shooting love hearts) and a dark one (demons, skeletons etc.). In one world she has the ability to rocket violently in any direction; in the other, to float a la Dixie Kong. Many of the platforming challenges revolve around switching between worlds to access environmental features that exist in one and not the other.\n\nFollowing the lead of Trine, graphics are full 3D models; the backgrounds in particular, with features morphing between light and dark, are spectacular. But there is a reason that precision platformers have tended towards 8-bit chic, and it's because genuine precision is very hard with 3D effects. Hitboxes aren't always clear, foreground and background elements can hide hazards, etc.\n\nWhat really lets Giana Sisters down, however, is the level design -- levels are long, repetitive, unpleasant and uninteresting. Perfect scores require collecting upwards of 700 gems in each level. The soundtrack is also incredibly grating.\n\nFor other, far better games with the same world-switching gimmick, try Guacamelee or Eversion. A vastly superior game with similar 2.5D graphics is Donkey Kong Country Returns.\n\n[Abandoned after completing 2 of the 3 worlds on Normal.]","December 28, 2013","false","2.8"," 0 of 3 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","3","0","0"

Do you want to take their hands, brush out their pigtails, and tickle them all over to watch those baby faces squeal and giggle? Or would you rather make them squeal by sliding that â¥â¥â¥â¥ down their yummy mouth and ramming it up that adorable â¥â¥â¥â¥? Chances are, you prefer the second option, as do the rest of us with a pulse in our pants. Giana is just so damn amazingly girly, it is just impossible to not want to corrupt her just a bit. Good thing for us, is that Giana is in real life one fully corruptible â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥ with an insatiable lust for nastiness. Those darling eyes and teeny smile simply beg for a formidable â¥â¥â¥â¥ session. Her small, creamy â¥â¥â¥â¥ have got just the perfect amount of under-â¥â¥â¥â¥ â¥â¥â¥â¥, youâd swear it was drawn on by a renaissance master painter. Maria's â¥â¥â¥â¥ is scrumptious enough to make you want to enjoy a snack of milk and cookies on those â¥â¥â¥â¥ before you toss the sweets aside and dive right in, nose first, to devour her â¥â¥â¥â¥. The Giana Sisters truly are a full package because itâs not just their looks that make them count, but she â¥â¥â¥â¥ like a â¥â¥â¥â¥ in â¥â¥â¥â¥ on Valentineâs day. The way they pump their â¥â¥â¥â¥ and â¥â¥â¥â¥ it on a â¥â¥â¥â¥ would make even the blind open their eyes to see, and seeing is believing when it comes to The Giana Sisters.\n","November 6, 2014","true","0.6"," 1 of 6 people (17%) found this review helpful","17","1","6","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/InsaneMaka/recommended/223220/","InsaneMaka","I give de 10/10","http://steamcommunity.com/id/InsaneMaka/","353 products in account","Giana Sisters: Twisted Dreams is a platforming game that allows you to switch between two versions of one character, you have an innocent looking girl with blonde hair and light blue dress then you have this red haired girl that seems to be heavy on makeup and dressed in a punk style. The environment alternatives with the character that you chose which seems to show the side of the character which is currently hidden away, yet the music that plays seems to be according to the character that you have currently chosen. Itâs a very peculiar game to say the least and I personally love the art style and how much detail the developers have put into both alternating worlds. The characters only have one move or action that they can execute but you can alternate between your innocent side and punk side at any given time during that move or action.\n\nIn terms of the story... Well, let's say its there but almost non-existent but don't worry, I won't spoil it for any of you. I don't think the game needed a strong story to begin with, I mean it has the protagonist and antagonist which for a platformer is all it really needs. It has enough content to keep even a person like me who is usually very story driven interested.\n\nIn each level you will usually spend 5 minutes or more, depending if you're keen on collecting the gems lying around in the level. There are enough levels and gamemodes to offer you a good 10-15 hours of gameplay to keep you entertained which for the price is not bad. The levels are very varied and well laid out with traps and enemies but itâs far more forgiving than Super Meatboy or Blood of the Werewolf is.\nThe music is great, it has a fantasy feel to it and I love the alternation between calm and the edgy metal when you switch the characters.\nThe game modes are as follows:\n\nEasy- Pretty self explanitory, its the the easiest mode to choose from and offers more checkpoints than the rest of the modes.\nNormal- I found normal to be challenging enough, good for people that aren't looking to be pampered.\nScore Attack- Sort of a mix between racing against the clock for a better score and collecting as many gems as you can+defeating enemies for bonus score.\nTime Attack- Race against the clock as you try to beat the fastest time, although only if you're hunting the achievements. I personally wouldn't recommend it for the reasons that I will state in a moment.\nHardcore- If you die at any point during the level, you get sent back to the beginning aka no checkpoints to save your â¥â¥â¥.\nUber Hardcore- The good old days of gaming where you have to go through ALL of the levels from start to end, if you die you get sent back to the beginning of the first level. This mode will kick your â¥â¥â¥ and call you its â¥â¥â¥â¥!\n\nAll that being said, while I recommend this game there are some gripes with it. The levels sometimes are a bit too big and you can find yourself getting lost often especially during the time attack mode because even with the arrows placed to guide you where to go you will need to know your way around the map. Its strongly recommended to use a gamepad, the PC controls are kind of bad.\nThere's no level restart, I repeat there's NO LEVEL RESTART, that means that if you die during Time Attack Mode you have to quit back into the menu and select the level again OR you can finish the level and get sent back into the menu and select the level, either way you're looking at about 20 seconds of wasted time when the developers could have just put such a simple but helpful option.\nI'd be lying if I were to give this game a negative review though because I enjoyed it thoroughly, its a decent platformer that adds a few nice gimmicks here and there. That's all I can say about this game, I give it a 6/10.","August 13, 2014","true","13.1"," 0 of 9 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","9","0","0"

In fact, in order to progress through certain levels, you will be required to switch on the fly at various points in order to activate certain game elements or collect certain items, etc.\n\nOne thing I quite enjoyed was that the background music changed depending on which Giana sister you were playing.

A collector's gem, literally, There is 300-700 gems per the 30+ levels, with a lot incredibly difficult to collect. The originlal Giana Sister's was pulled from shelves years ago for playing to simillarly to the Original Mario Bros games, but this iteration feels like a truely unique experience.\n\nEach level is rated on a star system, where more stars are given based on the total amount of gem collected, and the least number of deaths. The main game mechanic is swapping between the two sisters abilities, Both have a basic jump ability, with one sister able to do a fiery dash charge, and the other sister has a spinning glide to move further. Each of the sisters has her own soundtrack too, with one being a typical sugary bouncy track, the other a punk metal tinted soundtrack which balances out the game.\n\nOnly disappointment is the repetition of the game content. The same enemies, general level lay-out and soundtrack get stale by the end. The additional levels, (Holiday themed, which are completely different) do help offset this, DLC is available, but your money would probably be better spent elsewhere.\n\nThere is some unlockable artwork and incredibly difficulty settings for those that beat the game and are looking for a steeper challenge.","July 2, 2014","true","13.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Twisted Dreams is no exception to this and it offers a very solid platforming adventure to play and be challeneged by. Sadly the game decided to implement what every platformer was for a while, a puzzle mechanic. Switching between the two sisters to get a different power and a different layout of the world can be fun but also very tedious at times. It does it well with the music being similar but having its own flair for each sister and each power being unique so it does offer a differnt challenege; but it does it too much and it seems like traditional powerups would of been more fun more often as well. The millionith time you press that button to switch worlds just to get a different colored gem, you'll know what I mean. The music and world design do kind of blend together after a while too, despite both being very solid in general. It isn't perfect but well made and fun; get it if you love platformers.","July 4, 2014","true","5.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game is so smooth, vibrant with colors, challanging and just plain fun!\n\nIt plays sort of like the newer Raymans, with the dual world strategy that is just implemented beautifully. You can play as a cute or a punk sister, the environment, opponents, obstacles and music changes when you flip the world. And oh my gosh the music here is just breath taking, especially the punk side; it could very well be the best OST I have found to date!\n\nThere are more than enough levels that tend to be long and require you to collect LOTS of crystals. After each world you get a boss to defeat and that level can only be unlocked if you gathered enough crystals in that world's levels. Some people dislike it, but I'd say its a good preparation as the bosses are VERY challenging, especially the last one. Difficulty starts off small, allowing you to pick up controls, but ramps up fairly quickly. Once you get in the groove though, it is just awesome.\n\nThere is also the expansion that adds another world to the game which is just as good and brings a whole new set of envirnoments, opponents and dynamics, making it worthy of your time.\n\n10/10!

While not a defining characteristic of the game, Twisted Dreams is a graphically stunning game for both your eye and your graphics card. It's one of the few games that has left a lasting impression on me in both the audio and visual department, which says a lot considering this game was created by a small team of indie developers. Just like any good platformer, the controls are solid, the gameplay mechanics, while not entirely unique, are very well done, the music is awesome, and, in my opinion, the game strikes a nice balance in providing a relaxing yet challenging experience. If you're thinking about buying this game, stop thinking and start doing. You won't regret it (unless you're very inexperienced with 2D platformers or don't enjoy a decent challenge).","July 22, 2013","true","0.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The game reminds me a lot of Sonic the Hedgehog except with a bit more variety throughout the level deisgn. There is quite a bit to do for each level and different difficulty settings and modes make it easily replayable.\n\nThe one downside I found for this game was the bosses, they are frustratingly slow. By this I mean they will wait a few seconds between attacks which personally drove my patience as I would keep dying and have to start from the beginning of the Boss and slowly get to the point of where I died. This was especially prevalant for the last boss. I won't give out any spoilers, but if you get to that part, you'll know what I mean.\n\nI Boss appears at the end of the last level in each section but I think they would have been better just giving them their own level as it puts me off having to go back and try and collect all the gems to then have to fight a really slow Boss at the end.","August 24, 2014","true","10.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I'm really glad I did, because it's an excellent platformer with quite a bit of replay value if you're a completionist who likes the OCD reward of a bunch of gem-hunting (I'm not, quite, but I'm close enough to be able to understand why someone else would enjoy it :)).  The visuals are really top-notch, especially when you consider they essentially had to create two redundant sets of visual/aural media because of the "world-twisting" central game mechanic.\n\nSpeaking of which: a short explanation.  In addition to the usual jumping-on-top-of-things platformer fare, there's a special function that "twists" the world between two perspectives (in the game's lore, they correspond to two sides of the protagonist's personality).  Each personality has a unique special ability, and throughout the game you'll have to use the right one in order to progress.  In some cases, the world will actually change to allow you to progress or uncover a secret.  To clarify the previous statement: the game world always changes visually when you twist, but in some cases it will actually affect the level geometry.\n\nThe Steam store page write-up calls Giana Sisters a "blistering hardcore platformer"; I'm not sure I'd agree on the non-boss levels.  I suppose it's not a walk in the park, and maybe years of Super Mario Bros. has led me to take a certain level of platforming dexterity for granted, but compared to something like Super Meat Boy, it's not even in the same league of difficulty (I consider this to be a good thing, by the way...while I understand why other people want to wear their victory over adversity as a badge of honor, I just see the grinding as a waste of time replaying the same content over and over when there are hundreds if not thousands of new experiences waiting in the next game).  Except for a few times, just plain old progressing through the levels is easy...but if you really want to collect all the gems, that's when you're going to have to bring your platforming A game.\n\nExcept, notably, for the boss battles.  It is literally hilarious (well, to me anyway) how much harder the boss battles are than the rest of the game, at least on "normal" difficulty; do a search in the Steam discussions for the final boss character's name ("Gurglewocky") if you want a good laugh (warning: you'll also find lots of name-calling back and forth between the "this difficulty level is stupid" crowd and the "you don't deserve to play video games if you're not hardcore" crowd).  The other boss characters are still insane (again, relative to the difficulty of the rest of the game) but eventually doable with enough repetition (you can memorize their attack patterns); the final boss is mostly an RNG fest due to one particular attack where fireballs rain from the top and bottom of the screen and the only places you can reliably stand are too close to the screen edge to dodge them.\n\nThe good news is, it doesn't have to be a deal-breaker: you can play the bulk of the game on "normal", and switch to "easy" for the boss fights.  I can't comment on the other bosses because I did eventually slog my way through, but for the last one I finally had to give up on the eternal grinding.  Thankfully, the easy mode really is much easier, and (to the developers' credit) in a very meaningful way that shows they put real thought into the process.  Rather than a few quick AI adjustments in code (which may have done the trick as well, of course) there are actual, significant changes in the level design that directly address the things I was grinding my teeth about on Normal, saying "This would be 10 times easier if I could just _____!".\n\nSo, an honest hats-off to the developers for doing what a lot of games can't be bothered with these days, and taking the time to account for those of us who want to experience the game, not without challenge, but without having to grind the same five-minute sequence for 6 hours.\n\nThe one real gripe I have is a pecularity of "The Rebel"'s (the two personalities, according to the game's Steam Trading cards, are "The Rebel" and "The Perky One" :P) special move; a quick burst of speed that also works as a rush attack.  Most of the time it's great fun, but the game has a mechanic where if you rush into an immovable object, you'll bounce off it at a 90-degree angle.  This is the most annoying thing ever when you're trying to do super-precise platforming moves, and just seems contrived; the only times in the game where I actually wanted the behaviour were specific set-pieces that were clearly created by the level designers to use the feature.  Other than that, it was just an excellent way to randomly kill yourself by richocheting off in some random direction in the middle of a complicated action sequence.  This is what I was referring to in the bullet points when I said the controls were tight and responsive "most of the time".\n\nOn the other hand, I'll tell you one other subtlety I really did like: the fact that both personalities' special moves are available at all times (on separate buttons).  In other words, if you're currently "twisted" to The Rebel, you can still hit the button for The Perky One's spin ability and it will immediately fire off (while simultaneously "twisting" the world to match).  It's hard to overstate the importance of that particular design decision; if you had to explicitly "twist" first, then hit a single "special action" button, some of those action sequences would have been pretty near impossible.  I wonder if that's how it originally was...because then I could see where you'd call the whole game a "blistering hardcore platformer".  If so, I'm really glad they changed their minds because otherwise I'd have quit after the first five minutes and wrote it off as another Super Meat Boy (looks really cool, but I just ain't got that kind of time).\n\nReview metadata\nDate of update    Time played    How far in base game (estimate)?

I just thought it would be interesting since its all dream sequences.

I do like how changing characters changes music and background and they help you solve puzzles by basically giving you the crystals to look for in order to get past the next section. They don't just leave you hanging and have you forget to switch because you like the Punk sisters music so much more.\n\nWhat I would say is a bit unnecessary is the fact that the girls hair is just so physics involved that it really kinda kills the frame rate at certain points. I get you're trying to make them look very dreamlike cuz of how flowy it can be but its quite over the top when you have each hair tendril falling at its own pace.\n\nOverall I would say get this game if you like a good platformer with simple puzzle solving and if you like collectibles.","June 30, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So about a year later I decided to load it up and see if it was worth trying out. Sadly I couldn't stand the game past level two, so I'll just give my first impressions of the game.\n\nRight off the bat, the controls didn't feel too great. Running and jumping feels really sluggish and floaty (not that floaty jumps are bad, it's just that they don't feel right in this game). The swirl glide move was okay, and the attack dash wasn't my cup of tea at all, simply due to the fact that it acts like a homing attack ala recent Sonic the Hedgehog games, yet can cause you to ram into enemies and die because the attack stops just before it connects if you aren't close enough. While jumping on enemies can be a more viable strategy, it still doesn't feel right due to the awkward jump physics.\n\nProbably the most GS:TD has going for it is the fairly decent looking environments, music, and concept of switching between dimensions/worlds on the fly to change the level layout. But aside from that, there isn't much else to say. The controls don't feel as responsive as a 2D platformer should, the entire premise is kind of boring (sure, collecting items is almost a platformer must, but collecting the gems really didn't feel fun), and to pour salt into the wound, the game took somewhere between 5 to 10 minutes after I completed the second level just to return to the level select screen. I'd look elsewhere for a 2D platformer.","August 18, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This became another reason I got bored with this game. Every puzzle I encountered was a slightly changed iteration of a puzzle Iâd already been through because the mechanics never evolved or changed.\n\n- Moreover, stagnant mechanics and repetitive platforming puzzles became too much for me during levels which seemed to go on forever and after time blurred together.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nMy opinion is definitely in the minority, but I just couldnât get into this game.

The artists were clearly organized with what they wanted to do. The red haired girl you can play as makes everything look like something from a recent Mario game. All bright, sunny, and sickeningly cute. Even the music becomes an energetic rock sorta thing.\n\nThe blonde one has a glide ability and turns things a dark version of what the other one looks like. Mushrooms are delapitated, signs are spiked, colors are faded. The music is the same song, but played on piano. There is a 3D animation for switching between the two worlds as well.\n\n","November 21, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Much like Saints Row did for GTA. This game tightens the controls and adds a certain charm that newer Mario Games lack.\n\nThe levels, while technically linear, definitely encourage exploration, in fact it's impossible on most levels to get all 5 stars with just the beaten path. They're also well designed, look great, and make great use of the awesome dual world mechanic. They're a little on the long side but far from boring. Did I mention that each level type has great bg music that plays either a chiptune or punk/metal version depending on which sister you're playing as\n\nAlthough, even with it's awesomeness, it's kind of hard to recommend generally because this game is hard, The first 5 levels are pretty standard Mario-esq fare, if a little tricky. 1-6 is where it stops going easy. And just finishing a level won't  get you the boss fights, you actually need to do kinda well. Don't be surprised if you have to play a level several times to get the stars you need. Although, if you're up for the challenge, this is easily one of the best platformers on steam and it is remarkably fair for the most part.","October 28, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I finished the game in the end, because I do not allow my self to let something unfinished, but it was really stressful, because I am one really nervous dude when it comes to games. I am not that young anymore and I do not have time or nerves to cope with this. Final boss literally ruined me, but I was so happy when I finished it and deleted the game that instant. So, why I recommend this? Well, if you are not an nervous idiot like myself, you should play it.

I've played most of the Mario games on DS and 3DS (3D Land, New Super Mario 1 and 2, etc), but somehow they just never scratched the itch.  Giana Sisters is beautiful with memorable music, and yet its challenge was the biggest draw for me.  The game quickly escalates in difficulty, but it's the kind of difficulty that results from a necessity for precision than a lack of good control, so it always seemed fair.  Combine this with a seemingly innocuous mechanic of switching between worlds to match up colors... we saw this in games like Outland and Ikaruga, but Giana Sisters somehow finds ways of using this mechanic in creative ways up until the last stage.  My one complaint is that the music, while enjoyable for a while, really starts to grate on your nerves as there are really only two songs playing throughout the entire game.","January 19, 2014","true","8.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It might only have the name in common with the original Giana Sisters from back then, but still it totally FEELS 1980sh!  3D wasn't really a topic back then, we were happy about 16-color games with simple but catchy chip music, scrolling (hopefully smoothly) in 2 directions... if you asked me in '85 what I'd imagine games to be like in the far far future, my answer woulda been something like Giana Sisters Twisted Dreams. With oooh so many colors, scrolling perfectly smoothly in ALL directions in multiple layers (parallax!) and of course Chris HÃ¼lsbeck music... here we go! Yes, for todays standards the game is hard. Hard but fair, on "normal" difficulty it's doable if you ain't got no overly clumsy fingers. Only the boss monsters are a pain in the â¥â¥â¥ but with some patience even those can be cracked. We are a bit spoiled nowadays... I mean, in the original Giana Sisters you had like... what was it... three lives? And that was it... three mistakes and game over, and return to the very beginning! Today, on "normal" you got unlimited lives here, you'll only get kicled back to the last of many check points. And except for the painintheassified bosses, I love everything about that game. The colorful graphics, the perfect jump'n run feeling, the driving sound track, the morphable backgrounds, drat, even gem hunting can be so frickin' motivating! The game is full of awesome ideas and in my opinion it's one of the damn best platformers of all times for the PC! Warmly recommended!","December 11, 2013","true","27.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Albiet I'm not very good at them so it's not uncommon for a platformer made these days to â¥â¥â¥â¥ me off sometimes. Mind you that isn't really a bad thing. Given my experience with platformers know a platformer is good when I'm shouting obscenities at the screen and hoping the developer dies in a fire when I keep missing a jump on normal difficulty. I'm just kidding Black Forest; you did a great job with this title and I'm looking forward having my â¥â¥â¥ handed to me in the sequal. Aside from gameplay I love the music mechanic between perky and rebel giana. I'd like to see a soundtrack released at somepoint if it hasn't been done already.

Some games try to be interesting by introducing new game mechanics every 5 minutes, Giana Sisters manages to be fun with only some basic mechanics that are introduced early on. It's definitely a 'real' platformer and not a puzzle platformer like many other recent games.\n\nGraphics are pretty awesome for a platformer, imo even better than Trine.\n\nOnly downside is that the game is somewhat ruined by the boring, annoying and frustrating boss fights - especially the last fight is so much harder than the rest of the game. It's very frustrating if you get to the end of a game and can't finish it because you can't win the repetitive and boring boss fight. I tried a few times and then decided to leave it be.

I just thought it would be interesting since its all dream sequences. I haven't progressed too far but what I see I like.\n\nThe game controls are simple to handle and its actually not too floaty of a platformer. I do like how changing characters changes music and background and they help you solve puzzles by basically giving you the crystals to look for in order to get past the next section. They don't just leave you hanging and have you forget to switch because you like the Punk sisters music so much more.\n\nWhat I would say is a bit unnecessary is the fact that the girls hair is just so physics involved that it really kinda kills the frame rate at certain points. I get you're trying to make them look very dreamlike cuz of how flowy it can be but its quite over the top when you have each hair tendril falling at its own pace.\n\nOverall I would say get this game if you like a good platformer with simple puzzle solving and if you like collectibles.","June 30, 2014","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The artwork is gorgeous and detailed and because you can flip from one dream state to the other instantly, each level has two completely different art styles. My only knock to the graphics is that there isn't a great deal of variety in themes. You get an outdoorsy setting, a castle setting, and that's about it. The music also changes as you twist the dream back and forth, half of it done by SID-metal band Machinae Supremacy. The music is enjoyable but suffers in the same manner as the graphics; lack of variety means you're hearing the same tunes again quickly. The controls are pretty tight but not perfect; they're solid enough to get you through the game but could become a sticking point in the more difficult modes.\n\nWhich brings me to an important point: This game is hard, and prides itself on that feature. The later levels are not for the easily frustrated! There is an easier remixed level mode but if you're playing on even Normal difficulty expect an uphill climb fit for the accomplished platform gamer. For the truly masochistic there are Hardcore and Uber Hardcore difficulties which up the ante by either sending you back to the beginning of the level or the entire game with every death.\n\nOverall this is a game with a few nicks on it but is otherwise a solid platformer for fans of the genre. Fun to play, to look at and listen to.","October 11, 2013","true","9.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

With the inclusion in the latest Humble Indie Bundle, it is definitely the game I have enjoyed most this year.\n\nPresentation\nBesides the Trine Series, this has got to be the best looking 2.5D sidescrolling game to date. The attention to detail is fascinating and given that every object has a counterpart you can instantly switch to, you'll more often than not press the switch key just to inspect the environment with awe. The developers succeeded in building an immersive engaging world with a twist.\nThe soundtrack is top-notch as well and the ability to switch between two perfectly-synced tracks in mid-game is a feature I never knew I wanted. It is simply awesome.\nThe game runs smoothly on my laptop and I have had no performance issues with it whatsoever. There are plenty of options to customize your experience available in the launcher.\n\nMechanics\nThe game has only one central mechanic to speak of, which involves altering between two worlds seamlessly. Doing so changes the background aesthetic, your character's appearance / special move, soundtrack flavor and the behavior of certain objects within the environment. It's never been done before in this elaborate fashion and completely original and surprisingly well executed; therefore most obstacles can be elegantly solved in multiple ways. Doing so is most rewarding, once you have overcome the very steep and often frustratingly confusing learning curve. You'll often find yourself pressing the wrong key one too many times or altering yourself into certain death. Although the game appears as a child-friendly cutsie platformer, it is rock-hard and unforgiving, especially in later stages and you die instantly from anything (unless you happen to have a shield, which is the only powerup in this game). Hardcore platformer fans will definitely find the degree of challenge they were expecting in this game.\n\nCriticism\nAfter I played through the normal mode, I went back to go gem and star hunting, but the game lacks a restart key or even button, which is pretty frustrating. In order to ace a level, you don't want to die all that much. So if you screw up, you need to quit the level, wait for the menu to load, go back to the level, wait through dreadful loading times once more and try again. This issue could be easily fixed.\nAlso, dealing with enemies can become quite frustrating. Most enemies can be taken care of by jumping on them / using the dash move. However, in many cases if you don't hit the absolute center, you die instead of the enemy. Also, if you dash toward an enemy and are just one pixel too far away, Giana will uncurl right before hitting the enemy and die instantly. This often happens with homing dashes as well, which defeats the purpose.\nThis could be fixed by making Giana uncurl a few miliseconds later or upon touching the ground.\n\nConclusion\nI wouldn't have expected such a AAA-esque experience with such a strong and original idea from an indie developer. They did a fantastic job.\nI would even go as far as saying that it surpasses the latest sonic games in depth and pacing.","February 24, 2014","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Only 2 hours in?  Oh, this is gonna change in the coming months.\n\nI like platformers in general.  I picked this and Rise of the Owlverlord during the 2013 Winter sales (for probably 2$/per) and gave it a try.  I launch it, and set all of my settings before I started, and as soon as the menu appeared, I was already liking it.  The music was just...awesome.  I see a bunch of extra things on the menu, but decide to just attempt the normal campaign.  The game starts.  I look around, and I see something of an Alice in Wonderland view.  The art style is astounding.  The controls were easy to pick up (though I personally think there is a curve to you if you use keyboard instead of a Xbox 360 controller), the abilities were good enough to get majority of the way through unscaved.\n\nThe levels progressively get harder, as they should, and I started to not get perfect runs (all gems, no deaths).  It got to the point where I would die as much as 50 times before reaching the next checkpoint.  But I enjoyed it.  This game made me think, innovate, and practice before I could progress in the challenge levels.  I personally love this game (or as much as I've played of it so far) and I'm planning on starting the other once I actually finish the core part of the game.\n\nFinal Results\n\nMusic-9.5/10\nGraphics-8.5/10\nArt Style-10/10\nGameplay-9/10\nReplay Value-9.5/10\n\nOverall-9.3/10\nRecommended Buy Price-Full.\nFinal Thoughts-\nIf you like platformers, you will not be disappointed.\nAlso, I strongly recommend a) Using the DX9 version instead of 10/11, and b) using and Xbox 360 controller.","March 13, 2014","true","4.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I am pleasantly surprised.\n\nOther reviewers have already covered the basics: itâs a mix of old and new school platforming that does a lot of things right. Iâd say itâs comparable to Super Meat Boy but GS:TD is a smarter platformer which much better graphics. There is more you can do in this game thanks to the ability switching and thus the levels are more engaging to play through with more secret areas to discover. The first few are laughably easy but before you know it the difficulty skyrockets. This is fine, though, because of responsive controls and a generous checkpoint system. You have infinite lives, too, but dying decreases your score. The music is nice and the changing scenery when switching between sisters looks beautiful. It's also very cheap. You get a whole lot for your money.\n\nThe only downside I can think of is that there isnât anything in GS:TD that keeps me glued to my PC. Itâs fun but after beating a couple of levels I am usually ready to do something else, and I donât see myself shooting for perfect scores or trying hard or uber hard mode (but those things exist if you are so inclined). GS:TD is a title I will keep coming back to and playing in gradual doses rather than something I will devour right away b/c I canât get enough of it. Still, itâs a high quality, well-made game coming from Greenlight/Kickstarter. Much higher caliber than other indie offerings I have played.","March 14, 2014","true","1.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even the switch between the worlds looks great and smooth.\n\n+ The Soundtrack is great. Lucky, the original musician from the Old C64 version, the legendary Chris hÃ¼lsbeck, is also part of THIS game and creates one good half of the music for it.\n\n- The game loses in the deepness. The Main-thing in this game is to switch between the worlds and (only) collecting the gems - nothing more. there is no beloved Ball-power-up or like. Its just jumping around and collecting the gems, sadly.\n\n- The riddles gets quick pretty hard, even frustrating.\n\n\nFact:\nEven if the game self looks great and the sound is nice. Giana Sisters TD has the big lack in deepness of game play. You jump just around, collecting gems all the time. There is nothing more you can "upgrate" your skills or like...or the old Power ups like the Ball, Thunder or like. You can only Jump, spin and smash. And that over and over in Levels and Riddles which become very quickly frustrating? No thanks.\n\nIm Sorry to say that but people who thought to buy this coz they could get some old 80s feeling or memories will get quickly disappointed. People and REAL Fans from the Giana Sisters-Series can i still say go better play the Original Giana Sisters on the C64 or the Game Boy DS version. Even if the grafic from both of them isnt even "up to date" anymore, hardcore player and lovers from the Great Giana Sisters will AND still love it like i do. Also there is this the original Legendary Soundtrack which made Giana also to a "Legend".\n\nGiana Sisters TD may still has the soundtrack but lacks in the gameplay...sadly.\n\n","February 26, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

All that said, fair warning this game is not for those who want an easy game, as after the first couple levels it quickly starts ramping up the difficulty until you reach a level of difficulty that would have fit right in with the old school NES and SNES games that gave us the concept of Nintendo Hard, and while a controler is recomended for play it is not needed and I have had about the same level of success with the keyboard as without. There are few platformers this good even being made anymore fewer still for the PC. I'm going to be sinking a lot of time into this game so I can safely say it is worth playing.","February 27, 2015","true","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The main mechanic of the game is this: you play as a girl with a basic jump and can use it in a Mario style attack. You have two alter egos that you can switch between at any time. One of them allows you to quickly dash via transforming into a fireball anywhere, and one allows you to swirl through the air slowly, kind of like Dixie Kong. It's a unique mechanic that is the focal point of the entire game. The environment will also change depending on who you are (platforms fade away, spikes pop out of surfaces), so sometimes you may have to fireball dash and then change immediately after or even during your fireball dash.\n\nThat's the game in a nutshell. Good things about this game? The art. This game is fully 3D has backgrounds with many, many layers of things going on in them, like waterfalls or windmills. When you change your personality, the environment will morph it it looks kind of neat. This game also has various modes to play, like time attack or score attack.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where the good things end.\n\nSo what went wrong? Well, this game feels like 2 people started making a game without looking at the budget and blew it all on the art. Despite having great graphcis, it feels very hollow and empty. You'll see the same enemies and environments over and over again, and despite having great art, it becomes tiresome to look at. There's problems with gameplay, too. It's all style and no substance. It's sometimes difficult to tell what is where and what can be jumped on and what can't, because the background is such a big part of the visuals. The camera zooms in too much on the player, and by the time you'll see some stuff, it's already on you. While you can adjust it, you don't exactly have time to fiddle with it while you're jumping around and trying to stay alive. Hitboxes are wonky, but not horrible. The controls are bad. I don't know quite how to descibe it, but jumping around and changing direction felt slightly unresponsive. Sometimes, you'll be in a bubble and have to float around the level, and he controls for this are god awful. Trying to slow down or change direction is a nightmare, and this is even worse when combined with the fact that some parts requires speed on a stop-and-go basis.\n\nIt's not a horribly bad game. If the gameplay aspect were polished up a bit, and the difference between the background and foreground were made more clear, I would definitely reccomend this game. But as it is, it isn't worth the full price. I picked it up at around 3 bucks, and I wouldn't pay any more, now that I know what the game is like. If you love platformers and see this on sale, you may want to pick it up. Otherwise, you'll want to spend your money on something else.","February 28, 2015","false","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Even the switch between the worlds looks great and smooth.\n\n+ The Soundtrack is great. Lucky, the original musician from the Old C64 version, the legendary Chris hÃ¼lsbeck, is also part of THIS game and creates one good half of the music for it.\n\n- The game loses in the deepness. The Main-thing in this game is to switch between the worlds and (only) collecting the gems - nothing more. there is no beloved Ball-power-up or like. Its just jumping around and collecting the gems, sadly.\n\n- The riddles gets quick pretty hard, even frustrating.\n\n\nFact:\nEven if the game self looks great and the sound is nice. Giana Sisters TD has the big lack in deepness of game play. You jump just around, collecting gems all the time. There is nothing more you can "upgrate" your skills or like...or the old Power ups like the Ball, Thunder or like. You can only Jump, spin and smash. And that over and over in Levels and Riddles which become very quickly frustrating? No thanks.\n\nIm Sorry to say that but people who thought to buy this coz they could get some old 80s feeling or memories will get quickly disappointed. People and REAL Fans from the Giana Sisters-Series can i still say go better play the Original Giana Sisters on the C64 or the Game Boy DS version. Even if the grafic from both of them isnt even "up to date" anymore, hardcore player and lovers from the Great Giana Sisters will AND still love it like i do. Also there is this the original Legendary Soundtrack which made Giana also to a "Legend".\n\nGiana Sisters TD may still has the soundtrack but lacks in the gameplay...sadly.\n\n","February 26, 2015","false","1.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I finished the game in the end, because I do not allow my self to let something unfinished, but it was really stressful, because I am one really nervous dude when it comes to games. I am not that young anymore and I do not have time or nerves to cope with this. Final boss literally ruined me, but I was so happy when I finished it and deleted the game that instant. So, why I recommend this? Well, if you are not an nervous idiot like myself, you should play it.

With the inclusion in the latest Humble Indie Bundle, it is definitely the game I have enjoyed most this year.\n\nPresentation\nBesides the Trine Series, this has got to be the best looking 2.5D sidescrolling game to date. The attention to detail is fascinating and given that every object has a counterpart you can instantly switch to, you'll more often than not press the switch key just to inspect the environment with awe. The developers succeeded in building an immersive engaging world with a twist.\nThe soundtrack is top-notch as well and the ability to switch between two perfectly-synced tracks in mid-game is a feature I never knew I wanted. It is simply awesome.\nThe game runs smoothly on my laptop and I have had no performance issues with it whatsoever. There are plenty of options to customize your experience available in the launcher.\n\nMechanics\nThe game has only one central mechanic to speak of, which involves altering between two worlds seamlessly. Doing so changes the background aesthetic, your character's appearance / special move, soundtrack flavor and the behavior of certain objects within the environment. It's never been done before in this elaborate fashion and completely original and surprisingly well executed; therefore most obstacles can be elegantly solved in multiple ways. Doing so is most rewarding, once you have overcome the very steep and often frustratingly confusing learning curve. You'll often find yourself pressing the wrong key one too many times or altering yourself into certain death. Although the game appears as a child-friendly cutsie platformer, it is rock-hard and unforgiving, especially in later stages and you die instantly from anything (unless you happen to have a shield, which is the only powerup in this game). Hardcore platformer fans will definitely find the degree of challenge they were expecting in this game.\n\nCriticism\nAfter I played through the normal mode, I went back to go gem and star hunting, but the game lacks a restart key or even button, which is pretty frustrating. In order to ace a level, you don't want to die all that much. So if you screw up, you need to quit the level, wait for the menu to load, go back to the level, wait through dreadful loading times once more and try again. This issue could be easily fixed.\nAlso, dealing with enemies can become quite frustrating. Most enemies can be taken care of by jumping on them / using the dash move. However, in many cases if you don't hit the absolute center, you die instead of the enemy. Also, if you dash toward an enemy and are just one pixel too far away, Giana will uncurl right before hitting the enemy and die instantly. This often happens with homing dashes as well, which defeats the purpose.\nThis could be fixed by making Giana uncurl a few miliseconds later or upon touching the ground.\n\nConclusion\nI wouldn't have expected such a AAA-esque experience with such a strong and original idea from an indie developer. They did a fantastic job.\nI would even go as far as saying that it surpasses the latest sonic games in depth and pacing.","February 24, 2014","true","20.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Giana Sisters provides a fun, interesting romp into a dream/nightmare land full of all kinds of great platforming elements. At times it can be a little hard, but with great checkpoints and lots of replayability, youâll be playing this again and again and again.","March 16, 2014","true","2.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I wasn't disappointed. Even with no familiarity with the series, it's a solid modern platformer packed with challenge and atmosphere.\n\nAnd there is plenty of challenge. The level design gets pretty unforgiving pretty quickly. One of my personal gripes with difficult platformers has always been the fact that I have to repeat the same areas so much that I often just end up quitting out of boredom. Twisted Dreams counters this with plenty of checkpoints and basically infinite lives. That might make it sound easy, but without sharp reflexes and a keen sense of observation, they won't do you much good.\n\nI definitely recommend it if you like platformers. It isn't *quite* Battle Toads, but that's only to its credit. Controller integration is excellent, too.

The main mechanic of the game is this: you play as a girl with a basic jump and can use it in a Mario style attack. You have two alter egos that you can switch between at any time. One of them allows you to quickly dash via transforming into a fireball anywhere, and one allows you to swirl through the air slowly, kind of like Dixie Kong. It's a unique mechanic that is the focal point of the entire game. The environment will also change depending on who you are (platforms fade away, spikes pop out of surfaces), so sometimes you may have to fireball dash and then change immediately after or even during your fireball dash.\n\nThat's the game in a nutshell. Good things about this game? The art. This game is fully 3D has backgrounds with many, many layers of things going on in them, like waterfalls or windmills. When you change your personality, the environment will morph it it looks kind of neat. This game also has various modes to play, like time attack or score attack.\n\nUnfortunately, that's where the good things end.\n\nSo what went wrong? Well, this game feels like 2 people started making a game without looking at the budget and blew it all on the art. Despite having great graphcis, it feels very hollow and empty. You'll see the same enemies and environments over and over again, and despite having great art, it becomes tiresome to look at. There's problems with gameplay, too. It's all style and no substance. It's sometimes difficult to tell what is where and what can be jumped on and what can't, because the background is such a big part of the visuals. The camera zooms in too much on the player, and by the time you'll see some stuff, it's already on you. While you can adjust it, you don't exactly have time to fiddle with it while you're jumping around and trying to stay alive. Hitboxes are wonky, but not horrible. The controls are bad. I don't know quite how to descibe it, but jumping around and changing direction felt slightly unresponsive. Sometimes, you'll be in a bubble and have to float around the level, and he controls for this are god awful. Trying to slow down or change direction is a nightmare, and this is even worse when combined with the fact that some parts requires speed on a stop-and-go basis.\n\nIt's not a horribly bad game. If the gameplay aspect were polished up a bit, and the difference between the background and foreground were made more clear, I would definitely reccomend this game. But as it is, it isn't worth the full price. I picked it up at around 3 bucks, and I wouldn't pay any more, now that I know what the game is like. If you love platformers and see this on sale, you may want to pick it up. Otherwise, you'll want to spend your money on something else.","February 28, 2015","false","8.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

So about a year later I decided to load it up and see if it was worth trying out. Sadly I couldn't stand the game past level two, so I'll just give my first impressions of the game.\n\nRight off the bat, the controls didn't feel too great. Running and jumping feels really sluggish and floaty (not that floaty jumps are bad, it's just that they don't feel right in this game). The swirl glide move was okay, and the attack dash wasn't my cup of tea at all, simply due to the fact that it acts like a homing attack ala recent Sonic the Hedgehog games, yet can cause you to ram into enemies and die because the attack stops just before it connects if you aren't close enough. While jumping on enemies can be a more viable strategy, it still doesn't feel right due to the awkward jump physics.\n\nProbably the most GS:TD has going for it is the fairly decent looking environments, music, and concept of switching between dimensions/worlds on the fly to change the level layout. But aside from that, there isn't much else to say. The controls don't feel as responsive as a 2D platformer should, the entire premise is kind of boring (sure, collecting items is almost a platformer must, but collecting the gems really didn't feel fun), and to pour salt into the wound, the game took somewhere between 5 to 10 minutes after I completed the second level just to return to the level select screen. I'd look elsewhere for a 2D platformer.","August 18, 2014","false","0.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Much like Saints Row did for GTA. This game tightens the controls and adds a certain charm that newer Mario Games lack.\n\nThe levels, while technically linear, definitely encourage exploration, in fact it's impossible on most levels to get all 5 stars with just the beaten path. They're also well designed, look great, and make great use of the awesome dual world mechanic. They're a little on the long side but far from boring. Did I mention that each level type has great bg music that plays either a chiptune or punk/metal version depending on which sister you're playing as\n\nAlthough, even with it's awesomeness, it's kind of hard to recommend generally because this game is hard, The first 5 levels are pretty standard Mario-esq fare, if a little tricky. 1-6 is where it stops going easy. And just finishing a level won't  get you the boss fights, you actually need to do kinda well. Don't be surprised if you have to play a level several times to get the stars you need. Although, if you're up for the challenge, this is easily one of the best platformers on steam and it is remarkably fair for the most part.","October 28, 2015","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The world transform between light and dark as you switch sisters, giving two unique visual representations of each environment.\n\nThe music is fitting for the characters and world, and like the visuals will transform seamlessly between lighter and darker representations as you switch sisters. I don't find myself listening to the music out of the game, but I left it on throughout my playthrough.\n\nVery important for any game, the controls are solid and responses are consistent and fluid. I didn't find myself dying and cursing the game for not doing what I told it.\n\nWhile the game itself is somewhat sort, probably around 6-8 hours, it is definitely worth the sale price (currently 88% off / $1.79), though the full price ($15) is asking a bit much for the short experience.\n\nIf you are a fan of platformers or simply enjoy the visual experience games can offer, this one is for you.","December 28, 2013","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's hair-pulling. It's a classic platformer that depends on precise platforming and correctly juggling the easy to learn game system - switching between Giana's two forms, each of which change the game world around her and give her different moves (the Sonic-like fireball of the dark Giana, and the precise pirouettes of the cute Giana).\n\nAnd sure, it's a platformer that plays well, but it doesn't scrimp on the other features. This game's art design is gorgeous (effortlessly shifting the world from the cute and cuddly one dark Giana is in and the dark and sinister one cute Giana is in) and the soundtrack is perfect for a platformer - catchy and up-tempo.\n\nBottom line I've been stuck on levels in this game for months and played it for hours on end. I push and push until it gives. And when it doesnt? Hell, I just play it again. Want a platformer that doesn't forgive, doesn't forget, and is a bloody good time?

Truly, a highlight of this game are the transitions between the light and dark worlds when switching characters.\n\n- The music for both worlds is really well done, and adds to the overall feel of the game.\n\nThe Bad:\n- For me personally, there needs to be a somewhat compelling story in order to justify the difficulties one must endure to reach the conclusion. Giana Sisters severely lacked this component, and as such, I found myself playing through levels only to finish a game on my backlist.\n\n- Giana Sisters gives you everything up front, and so all of your characterâs abilities are the same from start to finish. This became another reason I got bored with this game. Every puzzle I encountered was a slightly changed iteration of a puzzle Iâd already been through because the mechanics never evolved or changed.\n\n- Moreover, stagnant mechanics and repetitive platforming puzzles became too much for me during levels which seemed to go on forever and after time blurred together.\n\nFinal Verdict:\nMy opinion is definitely in the minority, but I just couldnât get into this game. I can see why some like it, but honestly, there were just too many faults that accumulated over the course of my playthrough for me to recommend this game.","June 22, 2015","false","5.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Twisted Dreams is no exception to this and it offers a very solid platforming adventure to play and be challeneged by. Sadly the game decided to implement what every platformer was for a while, a puzzle mechanic. Switching between the two sisters to get a different power and a different layout of the world can be fun but also very tedious at times. It does it well with the music being similar but having its own flair for each sister and each power being unique so it does offer a differnt challenege; but it does it too much and it seems like traditional powerups would of been more fun more often as well. The millionith time you press that button to switch worlds just to get a different colored gem, you'll know what I mean. The music and world design do kind of blend together after a while too, despite both being very solid in general.

Think Banjo Kazooie, but 2D and with weird magic dimension switching. That's all I have to say about the gameplay really. Good luck trying to 100% it, because there are plenty of good platforming segments and secret areas to find.\n\nThe visuals I thought were really great. The artists were clearly organized with what they wanted to do. The red haired girl you can play as makes everything look like something from a recent Mario game. All bright, sunny, and sickeningly cute. Even the music becomes an energetic rock sorta thing.\n\nThe blonde one has a glide ability and turns things a dark version of what the other one looks like. Mushrooms are delapitated, signs are spiked, colors are faded. The music is the same song, but played on piano. There is a 3D animation for switching between the two worlds as well.\n\n","November 21, 2015","true","4.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The music is decent but gets old kind of quickly, and the electronic "dream" music isn't nearly as interesting as the metal-infused half of the soundtrack, which made me actually try to avoid switching and having to listen to it. Combining this with the near-nonexistence of a story, the atmosphere of the game was far from compelling for me.\n\nThe levels are definitely too long and have far too many gems, and if you want to get a decent rating that means the whole game turns into a tedious hunt for hidden gems which doesn't allow you to enjoy any pure platforming fun. I also found that many sections were zoomed in too far, making it near impossible to anticipate and dodge many things suddenly appearing from off-screen. The 2.5D often made it ambigous which objects were solid obstacles and which were "hollow" and able to be passed through, and certain environmental hazards such as the spikes and vines did not have a clear enough visible difference between their "on" and "off" states.\n\nThe controls kinda blow! ESPECIALLY with the dash move, which seemed to be responsible for half of my deaths.\n\nThis game started off feeling fun and satisfying but soon seemed to just drag on and on (and it isn't even a very long game!) Compared to gems like Super Meat Boy or Spelunky, it's just way too sloppy of a game to work as a tight, ultra-tough platformer.","December 17, 2015","false","4.7"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Has a light/dark mechanic that lets you access different parts of levels, and becomes very tricky as you progress through the game.  Much better than the older Giana Sister games, which were basically just Mario clones.  This introduces a lot of new mechanics that make it less like Mario and more unique.  Won't take very long to beat if you're good at platformers, but there's a lot of replay value if you like collecting stuff and the levels are long and increasingly difficult.

Soon you understand that's basically a damn Mario, an old school platformer that challenges your reflexes and nerves in every possible way. If you're up to that, buy it. If you're looking for a Trine styled gameplay, stay as far from Giana Sisters as possible. This is a hard and unforgiving game.\n\nUpdate: Decided to get back into the game after a while. I don't know how exactly they have updated it, but there are now constant fps drops (from 60 to 40-50) on a PC that is much faster than the game's recommended system requirements. Fps drops make the game stutter, and since it's a platformer, this makes it simply unplayable. Bye, Giana Sisters.","February 26, 2013","false","3.9"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's pretty simple to pick up and learn, with the primary gameplay mechanic being a "swap" between the two sisters at the push of a button, and each sister has their own ability to assist with the platforming and problem solving in the game.  Giana Sisters provides some challenging areas that don't get too frustrating thanks to some pretty flexible checkpoints.  There is definitely replay incentive for those who want to collect 100% crystals on each level, as there were a ton of hidden areas I missed, even after doing what I thought was a pretty exploratory approach to the game.\n\nThere are two somewhat minor areas of criticism I have for this game, although these may not be as big of a concern to others for various reasons:\n\nFirst, there is virtually no story here at all.  There's a brief cutscene of sorts in the beginning, and after that, it's pretty much 100% gameplay throughout the rest.  Obviously if you're looking for a large narrative-driven aspect in your video games, you're better off looking elsewhere, but I don't mind it here so much because the gameplay held up well enough to keep me interested through the end.\n\nSecond, the length - there are three worlds in total containing six, seven, and ten levels respectively.  While I do like the game's style/art design, I didn't really notice a huge amount of variance from one world to the next, but new gameplay elements are added frequently enough to where this wasn't a deterrent for me.  Nonetheless, I ended up completing all three worlds in under 10 hours, which I spread out over the course of about two weeks.  I do find that fairly short, although considering the game's asking price (I didn't kickstart it; bought it in a Steam sale), this is honestly a pretty fair offering.  Plus, the stand-alone Owlverlord DLC adds another world's worth of content if you like what you get here.\n\nOverall, I was pleased with my experience with the game.  There's a somewhat interesting history with this franchise, and I'm glad I got to experience what I'd say amounts to a successfully kickstarted project.","May 9","true","9.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
