"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashleymurray/recommended/292120/","ashleymurray","Ash.ZA","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ashleymurray/","96 products in account","This game has a tremendous polarizing effect on gamers. Either you love it, or you hate it. Hence I'm not surprised to see such mixed reviews. (Of course, the poor port is adding fuel to the negative flames, but I'll address my views on that later on).\n\nSo here is where I am coming from; I have NEVER played a Final Fantasy game. This is my entry point into the franchise. I have played JRPGs but not on the PC, PS3 or Xbox; only old-school stuff like Sword of Mana on the Gameboy.\n\nI did not expect much from the game, as whilst I patiently waited for it to download, I read almost exclusively negative feedback on steam and on the internet. I tried to ignore it, yet it did leave a sour taste. I launched the game expecting the PC to practically burst into flames. Hence my extreme surprise at how much I am genuinely enjoying myself.\n\nI expected the game to be "unplayable". Touch wood, but the game has not yet crashed/stuttered/glitched whilst I have been playing it. I have not needed to tweak Nvidia settings besides fiddling with V-sync; I did this after I had some lag in one battle with 6 or so enemies. After switching it off, the lag didn't happen again (I don't know if that was conicidence or not). My computer is not state of the art. I could list the specs but, really, it's not the newest nor the best. However, it does exceed the minimum and recommended specs listed below. I think that perhaps one should bear that in mind when buying this game; I don't know how well it will run on either listed specs. Perhaps ensure that you either hit recommended or exceed it.\n\nNow, about the port. Yes, I wish the resolution wasn't fixed/I could adjust graphics or sound in game/the file size wasn't so damn large. But honestly? I am really captivated by this game. Perhaps this is due to me being fresh-faced. Perhaps I don't have preconceived standards for JRPGs and SE and FF. But, to me, the game looks magnificent and beautiful. I haven't even bothered to download the resolution fix because I'm enjoying the game as it is. Just as a side note, I am using a controller but I played for a bit with the keyboard and it was highly manageable. I prefer using the controller simply because I think the buttons have been mapped appropriately.\n\nNow the actual game itself. The issues I saw on the internet about the game mainly revolved around A) a confusing story B) linearity C) rubbish characters. Here is what I think; The story really isn't that confusing. I have spent a bit of time reading the in-game datalog but I'm following it just fine. The game is linear at the beginning, but it hasn't exactly irked me up to this point like I expected it to. In fact, I needed the slow, linear, tutorialized start because I am completely new to the game style. In terms of characters, they all are fantastic. Yes, the infamous Vanille is poorly English voice acted and makes, um, extremely strange sighs and moans. At one point I turned to my sister and said, "This sounds like a dodgy adult film." But she is overshadowed by the incredible Lightning Farron and Sazh. Lightning is a badass, yet her pain and inner conflict is so evident and tangible. Sazh is just great. Plus he has an afro with a chocobo chick just chilling inside it, try and not find that adorable.\n\nThe combat is REALLY great. I was worried it would bore me, but it has not as of yet. With the tougher enemies you need to micro-manage the fights intently; using Paradigm Shift has been a really interesting strategy and I'm starting to use it to my advantage. Combat is rewarding and I feel as though this game hits just the right difficulty; not too hard, not too easy. Just right for you to enjoy yourself yet still be challenged, without getting frustrated. This is so rare to find in a game.\n\nI know my views conflict with others, yet I reiterate again; I come from a fresh-faced point of view. I had low expectations that were exceeded by this game. If you are a first timer to the franchise, I hope your experience will be similar and as engaging as mine.","October 13, 2014","true","44.6"," 1,010 of 1,198 people (84%) found this review helpful 16 people found this review funny","84","010","1","16","35"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/retroskull/recommended/292120/","retroskull","Bones","http://steamcommunity.com/id/retroskull/","56 products in account","It's really hard to talk about this game. I've finally beaten Final Fantasy XIII and the first thing that comes to mind is, it really is a unique experience. So, is it good? Well, I can't say I liked it, but I can see why others would enjoy it or even love it. That's why you'll find so many different opinions about this game. I'm not recommending it because buying it is a risky move anyway. But let me tell you, if you think you're going to like it, you probably will, so go ahead and buy it if that's the case.\n\nI can't say anything that hasn't already been said. The game is extremely linear. No excuses. The problem isn't that you go from point A to point B and you can't do side quests or something else, that's something to be expected in some RPGs to be honest. But here, it's not just side quests that you can't do. You can't do anything. 90% of the game is a hallway. You can't find hidden stuff. You can't pick a different path to get to point B. You can't even *talk* to NPCs (well, you can, but you just have to stand in front of them and that's it). The interaction with the environment does not exist. I honestly can't feel attached to a world that seems to be static and unalterable. But of course, maybe you don't mind playing a game like this.\n\nOnce you get to Gran Pulse you are allowed to do a bunch of sidequests, mount chocobos and find treasures, yes, but that doesn't change the fact that the worlds feels... dead. You can't do much, you still can't explore and meet people, explore towns, or at least know a bit more about the main characters. It doesn't feel like an open world game just because you're free to move around.\n\nThe story is rather confusing, but that doesn't mean it's bad (especially if that's the kind of stuff you like). And I hope you like it because it's the most important thing that this game has to offer, and if you don't, you're screwed. Same with the main characters, they play a big role in the game, and they're not your typical heroes. Instead, they seem to be taken straight from a shonen anime, with extremely pronounced personalities. That's been done before (remember Palom and Porom? Locke? Zidane?) so keep that in mind.\n\nI think this Final Fantasy has a way better battle system than the previous ones, and most people seem to agree. It's dynamic and relatively fast-paced, and probably my favorite aspect of this game. But since you don't have much to do in the game, you're going to see it a lot.\n\nIn short, you have to like the story, the style, and maybe the battle system. That's pretty much what Final Fantasy XIII is. An on-rails RPG with no interactivity, with a long story and lots of battles.","December 26, 2014","false","59.1"," 1,405 of 1,798 people (78%) found this review helpful 44 people found this review funny","78","405","1","44","27"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/recommended/292120/","Sequekhan","Sir Auron","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Sequekhan/","280 products in account","Square Enix have created a fantastic Final Fantasy title that has left fans with mixed feelings, yet again.\n\nAs someone that has played the game to completion on both PC and PS3, I find very little to complain about.\n\nNew FF titles have always been about pushing the boundaries - this is apparent to us from long development times, sometimes wildly different art styles between consecutive titles, and also the stories behind the characters and gameplay. It's true that to some extent developers should be catering to the customer's needs, but at the same time we don't want a carbon copy of a game that came out three years ago. If you do want a flood of FFVII clones on the market then perhaps you should stick with FFVII.\n\nThirteen exists on its own and does not require you to have played any other Final Fantasy games to get your head around it. The story starts at a mid-point of sorts, on Day 13. As you progress through the story you discover snippets of what happened on the earlier days, and is cleverly crafted so that some of the bigger questions are left unanswered for the majority of the story.\n\nThe story centres on Lightning, an ex-soldier from an artificially created moon, Cocoon, orbiting (geostationary?) above the planet Pulse, and it starts in the thick of action and explosions and cutscenes, which can leave players feeling a bit bewildered. The take-home message? Most of the main characters are out to rescue Serah, Lightning's sister, who has been branded by a magical entity, and both Serah and the entity are enemies of Cocoon.\n\nThe plot thickens as all the main characters are eventually branded in the same way, gaining the ability to wield magic, but also acquiring a doom-timer in the form of a task they must fulfil within a certain time period. The characters are true to form, behaving as we might expect given the situation, but also occasionally not as expected. This dichotomy of behaviour is one of the more intriguing aspects of the story, but far from the only one. I do not wish to give too much away.\n\nInsofar as performance on PC goes, I did have some framerate issues, but nothing more than that, and only at specific points in the game. Don't look away in disgust! Having said this, I don't think you'll find it any different on the consoles. I think it could have been optimised better for all the systems it got released on, so if you're thinking of getting it I recommend PC. I had no stuttering issues (as others have claimed) and I'm just running Windows 7 Prof. with a GTX590 card.\n\nMore on the gameplay though. As expected, FF13 treats combat very differently from how other, previous titles did. Combat is real-time, but there is a cooldown after actions such as attacking, buffing or healing. I believe items are the only exception. So in a sense it is similar to the ATB (Active Time Battle) system from previous titles. But the similarities stop there. There are six roles to swap between during combat - Medic, Saboteur, Synergist, Commander, Ravager, and Sentinel. Each of these has its own speciality - medic for healing, sentinel for tanking and taking the big hits, commander for physical attacks, ravager for magical attacks, synergist for buffs and saboteur for debuffing or crippling the enemies. Oh, and if you really want to damage enemies, you're going to want to stagger them.\n\nIt may seem like a lot to take in, but with a bit of practice you'll find it works pretty well. It's possible to customise your preset 'paradigms' as they're called, so that you can go from straight up assault to full defence at the flick of a button.\n\nFF13 is often criticised for its linearity and lack of side quests, but I value a good story more than how complex the game is laid out. If you need a break from grinding for experience towards role levels, HP, strength and magic, there is also Chocobo Treasure Hunting, unique monster hunts, and farming enemies for parts and gold so that you can upgrade and empower your Ultimate Weapons, of which there is an interesting selection to choose from , including various passive and hidden stats (which you will more than likely need a guide for!)\n\nThe art is sometimes breathtaking, vast, and beautiful, but occasionally you might find it a bit monotonous. End game maps such as the Archylte Steppe and the Yaschas Massif are so large and indentical in almost every respect that I'll hazard most players tire of it sooner or later. And yet, the game also boasts some true fantasy imagery - Lake Bresha turned to crystal, walking under frozen waves and churning waters; the awe-inspiring Tesseracts and Orphan's Cradle, where the environment is ever-shifting, ever-changing all around (probably why there's a framerate drop here). I haven't even mentioned some of the gigantic bosses - both mechanical and organic, and even the fabled 'Summons' that have become so much a staple of the FF games.\n\nI find myself playing a large chunk of the soundtrack on an almost daily basis too, for there is some incredible work right there. Empowering, mysterious, emotional, it just fits so well with the scenarios you find yourself in that it's hard not to find yourself liking at least some of it.\n\nSo what if it's a bit linear? I still enjoyed it, and definitely will again. I consider it 126+ hours well spent, and if you think you're up to trying it I can think of no other RPG I recommend quite as much as I do this one.

I heard a lot about these games, but never actually got to play any of them seriously before this particular installment.\nI am also relatively inexperienced with JRPGs in general. I played several of them, but I am mostly D&D-type of a guy.\nI did beat the game, so I can talk about it safely from the beginning till the end.\nI played the game with GeDoSaTo on (downsampling program by Durante which basically allows to launch the game in any possible resolution).\nAnd finally: I am somewhat biased towards Japanese voice acting, and while it doesn't really have any significant influence on my opinion on the game overall, I tend to enjoy some pieces of dialogue other people would consider cringeworthy. Which is why I played FFXIII with Japanese voices, so I can't tell anything about the English ones.There is a tl;dr section at the end, if you want short conclusions.\n\nWith all of that out of the way, let's proceed with the recommendation, shall we?\n\nFirstly I will address the port issue. And, my God, there is an issue here. What does this port have? 60 FPS. Theoretically. However these 60 FPS often turn into anything but 60. Sometimes you get 30. And sometimes it drops below even that. And if I may remind you, FFXIII is almost five years old at the time of writing. What does this port not have? Plenty of things, actually. There are no sound options. Half of the keys are not rebindable for some reason. On launch the game was locked at 720p with nasty black bars on all four sides of the screen (at least on my machine, maybe it's Radeon-specific). There is no way SE could not have made all the options and optimization. They just chose not to. To give Square Enix credit though, they listened to the fans and gave us dual-audio. Appreciate the option. The game is also quite stable - it only crashed twice for me in 87 hours of gameplay. The controls with keyboard and mouse are at least okay, but a proper mouse support in menus (instead of it just functioning as a mini-keyboard) would be nice.\n\nUPD: As of December 11 the game now has resolution options (up to 1080p, so no 4k for you) as well as AA and shadow resolution. It's good that SE gave us an ear and implemented these, although the fact still remains that there were no graphic options of any description on launch. And the time it took them to respond with some action is, well, two months.\n\nNow let us move on to the game itself. While I am strongly disappointed by the port quality, the contents of the game I am pleased with. Let me warn you: FFXIII is linear. As in linearly linear. In more ways than one. But is it really bad? No, I do not think so. This game is about watching cutscenes and fighting. If those things are good, then I myself do not care about linearity. And, well, they are. It also means that if you happen to dislike combat and/or cutscenes, you won't like the game either. The cutscenes are gorgeous and all, but the battle system is the highlight in my opinion, so let's talk about it a bit. The battles take place in real time with some turn-based limitations, where you have to make quick decisions while the action gauge fills. Your party consists of up to 3 characters (you can't choose them until chapter 10) and each of them has a role or a class. The combination of two or three classes (depending on how many characters are in the party now) is called Paradigm. Outside of the battle you can prepare 6 Paradigms and after that you can switch between them at any time in the battle. That is called Paradigm Shift and it allows you to quickly react to the situation at hand or to just choose your tactics on a whim. It turns already spectacular battles into something more interesting. Yes, you can just hit Auto Battle button and let AI do everything for you, but it's boring this way, and the AI doesn't make optimal choices considering AoE, buffs/debuffs and the type of your attack. Personally, I didn't get bored of fighting in this game even once. It's flashy, dynamic and requires some thinking to do right. It also has a lot of smaller nuances, like trying to initiate a battle with your enemy not noticing you (which makes the fight much easier) or character's action animation actually influencing his/her position (if during an attack your character is in the jumping animation, enemies may instead hit the ground or just cancel their attack).\n\nThe game opens up rather slowly with the first several hours being basically a lengthy tutorial in terms of mechanics, since they are introduced gradually, but there is a lot to learn. Exploration is practically nonexistent before chapter 11, where you get to roam an open-world style locations and do some side-quests, all of which (and I do mean all) are just "kill this monster" tasks. It's pretty dull, but since combat is fun, I found it more or less acceptable. Sometimes these quests even open roads to hidden locations with more challenges and items. Speaking about challenges, there are some rather nasty enemies, which are kinda hard to deal with. Not to mention, that there are enemies with 16 million HP capable of one-shoting an inexperienced party.\n\nSome people say that FFXIII's story is confusing. I don't think it's true - the plot is quite straightforward, somewhat typical and predictable, but it gets the job done. Since the cutscenes are quite a spectacle and the dialogues are well voiced (at least in Japanese), I enjoyed the overall story as well. Especially I want to praise Lightning's and Fang's voice actresses. On the other hand, some characters do not match well with their voices until you get used to them. The characters themselves, by the way, are quite bland and rather uninteresting. They are typical for your run-of-the-mill Japanese anime/manga/VN. To give authors credit though, the way they explain the connection between seemingly unrelated bunch of people is rather neat.\n\nI would also like to praise the game's setting. The worlds of Cocoon and Pulse, Mass Effect-style technologies and fear of magic wielded by pseudo-gods fal'Cie and their human servants l'Cie - there are a lot of interesting concepts, and the lore in general is compelling to say the least. I found myself striving to defeat some difficult optional bosses just to get a new piece of said lore.\n\nThe graphics. Even by default it's a nice-looking game, but with GeDoSaTo on it can be really stunning. Character models and lighting effects are especially good. Texture quality - not so much, but the game sure knows how to present itself and make it look good despite the lack of HD textures. And well, for a five year old game FFXIII is surely a looker. I've got a huge gallery of screenshots to prove that point.\n\nA couple of words about the music as well: it's really pretty and provides a fitting atmosphere. Sometimes I found it odd, when the music contained real vocals, but it was beautiful nonetheless. I think, I will get the soundtrack for the game, which I don't do often.\n\nTl;dr\nThis game's defining features (in my opinion) are as follows:\nBad port\nLinearity\nSide content can be boring\nLots of CGI movie quality cutscenes\nFun combat system\nAverage plot\nUninteresting characters\nEnjoyable voice acting (JP)\nCompelling setting\nNice graphics\nPerfect music\nI do recommend the game despite it having some rather major problems. The combat is great and the story is decent. It is quite a fun experience and the price point is laughably low. I don't want to support the idea of such a bad port coming to PC, but I also can not stop myself from enjoying FFXIII and expecting it's sequel to come our way.","November 1, 2014","true","89.0"," 282 of 352 people (80%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","80","282","352","2","6"

I can see where it came from, honestly, so it's an odd game to review. You see, I bought it expecting to play for a couple hours, see that it was as bad as they say, and then chuckle as I turn it off, ready to move on. This didn't happen though, I ended up finishing this one. Why did I finish it? Well...\n\nObjectively speaking, this game checks off every item on the list of elements that draw the hate crowd: drastic changes to an established and venerable game series, confusing and poorly presented story, awkward 'romance' scenes, weird anime character archetypes (looking at you Vanille), and very linear gameplay with a streamlined battle system when compared to ealier games in the series. These problems really are present, and I can see how they annoyed people, especially uber fans who wanted this game to be just as good as they remembered the earlier games (bit of a loaded point there, I'll leave you to interpret it's meaning). Personally, I didn't really mind these problems as I wasn't expecting a masterpiece to begin with. I actually found all these elements entertaining in their own right, especially considering the concept of the story is pretty interesting if you can get past all the weird anime melodrama and the really horrid (at times) dialogue. ("Worst birthday ever!" is exclaimed by a character who is supposed to be the practical level headed uber soldier.)\n\nIn addition to the problems that were present in the original console version, the PC port is laughably inept. A game this old should not struggle to maintain 30 frames a second on a PC equipped with a GTX 980 and the surrounding hardware to support it. I've never had a problem adjusting to crap framerate, but if you're the type to get nauseated from the sight of inferior video display, steer clear of this game.\n\nSo what did I like about it and why did I finish it? No reasons that were intentional on the part of the developers. As I said, the bad elements are very entertaining and worth playing if you find this kind of thing funny and not intolerable. The battle system starts out infuriatingly simple, but gets better after an excruciating 20 hours of tutorial-like handholding, during which my interest was only sustained by the train wreck of a plot unfolding. When the battle system does open up, however, it's actually fun to experiment with, where the point is to sort of pre-program the party make up and switch between these programs in order to react to changing battle conditions.\n\nAlso, Lightning's character design is incredibly attractive so thats okay...\n\nI'm not obsessed or biased\n\nI guess\n\nNot like I have her profile background or anything\n\n","December 5, 2015","true","54.6"," 208 of 262 people (79%) found this review helpful 117 people found this review funny","79","208","262","117","5"

It's not the bet FF game by far, but not the worst like many people say. There are some pretty meh ones out there besides FFXIII.\n\nFFXIII is criticized for being too linear. Well, it is (more linear than other FF titles). But like all FF games, once you reach a certain point, there's extra side content to be done like in all FF games. Unfortunately you are 100% restricted from any kind of side content until hitting Gran Pulse (20 hour mark). You could easily triple your playtime on side content, however. I do admit that the side content is a bit on the dry side, as it doesn't necessarily contribute to the lore of the FFXIII or expand on other aspects of its story.\n\nThe story is decent, the characters are okay, the combat is just a tweaked version of the FFX-2 combat system but designed for you to only control one character. It's rewarding and everything should be at a standard that's good enough to keep you intrigued. If it doesn't, then it's just not for you really. But let me tell you, I enjoy and admire the hell out of this game. It keeps me entertained, and so I keep running down the long hallways they put in front of me to meet my next challenge. It's definitely not my favorite, but it's definitely not my least favorite. But as of now, the FFXIII games of the series are the best looking in the franchise, still have the great soundtracks you all love, and still feel like a FF game to me.

Snow's group NORA)\n- Poor optimization for PC; many, many issues trying to get the game to run properly, that often require invasive workarounds (the stuttering problem was truly debilitating)\n- Maps are unforgivably linear in nature; there is virtually no exploration until very late game, and even that is very limited in scope\n- Skill advancement, while very friendly to new players, is also horribly linear and boring\n- While most of the dialogue was excellent, it was interspersed with some noticeably cringe-worthy choices (the worst offender being Hope's 'Operation NORA' stint; it was bad enough to rival FFX's laughter scene)\n- Very little in the way of side-missions and activities\n\nIf you enjoyed this review, please follow my curator page.

The only minor irritation was the fact that the game locks the mouse cursor to the center of the window and sometimes when you alt-tab it doesn't release the mouse cursor and you have to keep alt-tabbing between windows until it releases it.\n\nControls are pretty comfortable, I have a PS3 controller but I actually preferred just using keyboard and mouse.\n\nThe game itself: 9/10\nI loved the story and the music, the cinematics were amazing and the characters are likeable.\nThe gameplay is casual-friendly, hardcore FF fans who like extremely difficult sidequests/puzzles may find themselves disappointed. Everything is pretty linear until Chapter 11 where you can finally get around to doing sidequest content.","December 10, 2014","true","68.3"," 271 of 361 people (75%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","75","271","361","3","3"

Was a little hessitant starting a new game because I wanted to play on the best possible settings, and now I can! Cheers everyone!\n\nUpdate as of 2:15 pm PST: Durante a well known modder who helped fix many of the issues in Dark Souls and Deadly Premonition is said to be working on a fix atm for all of us fans.  Although his tool is barebones, from what I have been reading, it seems that a fix to the resolution issues is on the way. Initially I wanted to do a write up about why PC gamers should give FF13 a chance, but I felt this was the more pressing issue to inform fellow fans and potential customers about.\n\n-----------\nMy Lightning body pillow is more realistic than this port. All jokes aside heres a rundown of what you can expect from the PC port of FF13.\n\nGames Resolution is locked at 720p, Up to 60 FPS (if you are lucky to even run it that stable,) 30 FPS cutscenes.  This isn’t a case where the consoles are keeping the PC port down, its the incompetence from Square Enix keeping the game down.\n\nWhat makes this more disappointing is the sheer fact that SE was hush hush about the details regarding the port and only recently, as of last night they updated their minimum settings. They had weeks to let customers know, and yet instead of informing gamers, they waited until the last possible moment to reveal the games specs.\n\nThe game is 50gigs to download, and is probably the largest game I have downloaded to date on Steam, on top of that I have had a nearly two hour wait after its game’s release time just to unpack all the files in order to start the game up.\n\nThe xbox version is around 20gigs and Ps3 version is around 40gigs, yet early comparison pictures courtesy of bittercup from the neogaf forums show the stark differences between these versions.  (http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showpost.php?p=133609256&postcount=3004) For being bloated in size, it does not make up for it in the looks department.\n\nIf you own an Nvidia graphics card you can tweak a few settings here and there like forcing AA in to the game, but why should gamers have to do this? Why aren’t these bare minimum features already in the game? People are even suggesting ripping out the video files from the PS3 version and seeing if they can work in the PC port.  But even then why should it be left to consumers to tweak the settings in order to get the performance they want out of the game?  What about AMD users, what options do they have?\n\nOn one hand I am disappointed - but on the other hand I am hopeful the community can mod this to the point where it is the preferred platform to play on.\n\nTo me Final Fantasy 13 is a great game that just got a lot of flak for its linearity in a time where most games were linear, and they still are even to this this day.  While this may not the best RPG ever made, many of the criticisms from the big gaming press in my opinion were unwarranted for FF13. I haven’t played FF 13 in many years after I beat it originally on the PS3.  I eagerly bought the PC version in hopes that it would be the definitive version to play, but I guess Square Enix was too busy pushing out a “definitive” version of Sleeping Dogs, a game that came out a couple years ago.\n\nNot only did I purchase this port because I wanted to replay it, but to also show my support to SE that there are PC gamers like me that want these types of products out on our platform.\n\nMy suggestion is wait for news from modders before purchasing this, lazy port jobs should not be rewarded.  That or just wait for a steam sale.  Thanks for reading and hopefully this gives you an idea of the state of the situation of FF13 on the PC's.","October 9, 2014","false","9.8"," 1,244 of 1,784 people (70%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","70","244","1","2","52"

My opinion of the game is not an attack against the people who enjoy it. There is no need to defend yourself against me. If you have a differing opinion of the game, I encourage you to write a review of your own. I do NOT encourage you to leave nasty comments and/or personal attacks on this review (nor does the Steam SA). You're welcome to disagree with my opinion, but please be civil and decent.\n\nI wrote this review immediately after having finished FFXIII, and before reading anything about the sequel, or what anyone else thought of the game. Yes, this review is colorful and dramatic, but it's because it represents my gut reaction: utter dissatisfaction. I have re-read the review and don't see that it throws any unjustified punches or says anything inaccurate. Therefore, I am leaving it as is. Please, stop whining. It won't change my opinion.\n\nI have played every entry in the Final Fantasy series, and I can tell you right now - this game is not very good. I thought my mild disappointment with XII was the most I'd ever dislike a FF game, but boy was I wrong. XII is a masterpiece compared to XIII.\n\nThat said, it's not a complete disaster. The battle system has some redeeming qualities. The game looks and sound amazing. Leveling up your characters in the Crystarium has that old MMO "treadmill" effect that gets you into this state where you just can't seem to put down the controller, no matter how awful the game is, or how frustrating it becomes. I'm not talking about "man, this is a hard and I can't beat it, and it's frustrating". I'm talking about frustration from just really, really poor design choices...\n\nFirst off, FFXIII is, hands down, the most linear RPG I have ever played. You will spend the first 30 hours of the game literally traveling in a straight line from one corridor to the next, with no ability to explore, or hit the world map (there isn't even a world map, btw - only game in the series without an explorable world map, ♥♥♥♥ing incredible)."\n\nOk, so what will I be doing with my time as I travel in a straight line, you might ask? Well, you'll be fighting, of course, with Square's so-so Combat Synergy Battle System. And that's all you'll be doing. The same monsters, over and over. Over half the monsters in the game are just re-skinned versions of ones you fought 20 hours ago. Going into a fight, there's absolutely nothing to distinguish how hard it will be - not appearance, not context, nothing. There'sa 1 in 3 chance that what you're fighting will be:\n\nA) some trash mobs that you won't even have to switch paradigms for, and will obliterate in less than 30 seconds.\nB) a boss fight (this can often be predicted by context) or mini-boss fight (these often can't be predicted at all) that may or may not require you to switch paradigms, apply buffs or debuffs, or one of the basically 4 or 5 possible functional combinations (combat is not very deep).\nC) some trash mobs that, for some inexplicable reason, are harder than any creature or boss you've ever faced before and will wipe your party out because you didn't have that one particular paradigm slotted that allows you to win. Either you figure out/Google what the rotation is to beat the trash mob, or you go back and beat up on some less overpowered opponents until you have the CP to increase your stats so that the fight is now reasonable for the significance of the encounter.\n\nThat's it. That's the whole game. At least 60 hours of that is what you have to look forward to. There are no mini-games. You can't explore. You can't find items, really. Everything is either dropped by mobs or found in chests, and then you sell or use other drops to upgrade those items. There are no side quests to speak of. No puzzles, no mysteries. Chests are laid out nice and neat right in your path as you trudge forward through the linear storyline. The most work you have to do to find a "secret" chest, is to turn right or left instead of following your waypoint. Walk into a little area just off the beaten path. Maybe fight a monster or two. That's your "exploration". There are side quests of sorts, in the form of C'ieth Stones, which give you "marks" that you must kill. They're not fun, as the gameplay basically consists of running from one side of the map to the other, fighting trash monsters, until you get to your mark and fight it. The only real value or drive in doing these is to get CP/items/5 stars for your achievement. Grinding, essentially. That's the whole game.\n\nYou can't quest for ultimate weapons... but you can grind for them. Yeah! Just keep farming mobs so you can sell or acquire enough items for upgrades. You then sell the items you bought (in a menu you access from any save point) to buy other items that you use to increase your weapons stats until it levels up to the next form. You can do this twice, and you will have an ultimate weapon for your character (Upgrading is also performed in the aforementioned save point menu, btw). Now, repeat 5 more times and you have ultimate weapons for all your characters. Woohoo! Didn't that feel significant? No, it didn't.\n\nSo, yeah, this sounds really bad. If you made it this far, you're probably thinking there has to be some redeeming quality. The story has to be good because it's Final Fantasy, right? The answer is no, it does not. It doesn't even have to make sense, or involve likable characters. Your party consists of the most one-dimensional, paper thin, saltine cast to grace a video game. How do we know it's bad? Not only will you not know what the characters what, or why they want it - neither will they! Yes, your characters motives seem to change every 5 minutes, and for no other reason than to move the story along. A character that was woefully depressed two cutscenes ago (which isn't very long, since cutscenes happen every 10 minutes or so), will suddenly be perfectly fine, and for no apparent reason other than "well, I've just decided it's all ok." Couple this with the traditionally cheesy writing of JRPGs, and the absurd and bizarre reactions to story events of some characters (I'm looking at you, Hope and Snow) and you've got a recipe for "I don't give a damn about these pixelated golems"-itis. The game culminates in a "magic" ending. Why anything happens the way it does is never explained. We never learn anything concrete about the world, or why it is the way it is. Why characters do the things they do at the climax of the storyline remains a mystery...and everyone in the cast seems to be myseteriously fine with that.\n\nI'd say that this is the worst game in the mainstay FF series, if it weren't for the mess that was FFXIV. At least, before that game was launched, scrapped, and rebuilt into an actually pretty damn good MMO. This is certainly the worst entry in Square's iconic single-player RPG series... but I'm saying that having never played FFXIII-2, which I have no intention of doing. FFXIII makes me feel as if every time the designers were faced with a gameplay-shaping decision, they failed to ask themselves what would make the game more fun and engaging. If they did indeed ever ask themselves that question, the answer, 9 times out of 10, appears to have been "screw it, throw in another cutscene or make Hope or Vanille cry or something".\n\nI finished FFXIII out of a sense of duty. I was holding on to the hope that something interesting would happen, or the story would take a turn, or the game would open up and let me explore...but it never happened. It wasn't a completely miserable experience...but when I saw the ending, I really wished I had spent my time doing something else. Is this game worth $15? That's not even the question you should be asking. You should ask yourself, "does this look like something I want to invest 60 hours of my life into"... and I would advise you that the answer should be a resounding, "no".","February 22, 2015","false","73.2"," 248 of 341 people (73%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","73","248","341","27","15"

I think I spent a little over 10 hours on it. I hated every minute.\nWhy? It was exactly what everyone said it was.\nFlash forward to just a little awhile ago, and I just completed a play-through of the PC version. I, well, I liked the majority of it.\nWhy? It is exactly what everyone says it is.\n\nConfused? Yeah so am I. Hmm..It sounded clever in my head. *shrug*\n\nApologies in advance. This review is going to echo nearly every other FF13 review out there. Everything you've heard is true, but not all of it is actually bad. In the end, everything is subjective. What doesn't work for you might work for others, vice versa, and all that good stuff.\n\nThe plot to FF13 is pretty dang convoluted. This is mostly due to the fact that you're dropped into the game with hardly an idea of what's going on. All these made-up words are being thrown at you, and everyone sounds like an obnoxious jerk. This is completely understandable, since Lightning and Snow are two of the first characters you meet. Basically the story goes like this: become a l'cie, get sweet powers, run down several corridors, punch the space pope in his stupid face, and try to figure out how not to become a cie'th (crystal zombie). Once you understand the basics you can switch your brain off and watch the pretty cut-scenes.\n\nThis game does take about 15 hours to reach its full potential. A good portion of the game is spent under some sort of limitation. Lightning and company split up more often than a Scooby Doo cartoon. This means two-person parties, and an overlong tutorial. This is the second-most draining part of the game, ESPECIALLY compared to prior Final Fantasy titles. I could be getting so much done if I was playing any other FF. I could play through FF1 twice, reach space in FF4, get involved in some major sidequest in FF7, and so on. The only FF title that compares in this regard is FF10. Even that game gave players a full-party before they left the first town (Zanarkand doesn't count because it's a city).\n\nDespite this, FF13 is still very much a game. This is due to the huge emphasis on combat. It's a fantastic battle-system, probably one of the best of its kind. If anything, the limited freedom forces the player to learn how to actually fight, since grinding for level-ups is a non-factor for those 15 hours. This makes for tons of opportunities to learn the ins and outs. Everything from when to switch paradigms, which enemies to focus on, and cutting out all of the in-efficiency (spending too much time healing, not staggering enemies fast enough, etc). There's a lot that goes into each battle, even in the 2-15 hour time-frame. The boss battles are superb.\n\nWhen you finally arrive at Gran Pulse, that's when the real game begins...eh. At first I was really excited to reach this portion of the game. I couldn't wait to explore a world and move in a direction besides forward. Honestly, while I appreciate what Square-enix was going for here, it could have been done better. The biggest annoyance is that there's just so much running around. The major side-quest involves cie'th stones. Find a cie'th stone, kill the monster it directs you to, and collect a reward of some sort. All this running around gets old, especially if you're not quite adept at dodging battles. Warp-points and Chocobos are available after enough progress is made, but I really could go for an arena or a list or something. However, if I could just choose what monsters I wanted to fight, wouldn't that make Gran Pulse just a bunch of filler to wander around in? Hmm....well it's pretty. At least there are a nice amount of character-specific scenes while exploring.\n\nGrind Pulse is also where the game starts to bury you in busy-work. Like any good J-RPG, the world is going to end in less than 10 hours, everyone is about to die, but what's stopping you from spending the next 30 hours making your party super strong? Aside from getting those all important stat bonuses through the Crystarium, you're also going to want to upgrade your gear. It's that moment where you realize that "Hey! I can make my weapons really powerful!" but you're flat broke. Trying to get cash is the #1 biggest problem I have with this game.\n\nYes, I could use cheat-engine to give myself all the money I could ever need. But forcing the player to take shortcuts isn't good game design. Hell, nowadays game-developers are trying to sell us shortcuts. Buy my way to level 99? Why do that when I can just youtube the ending for free? The only legitimate (?) & logical(???) way to make good money is by killing giant turtles with Vanille's death spell. The amount of money necessary to max out a weapon's capabilities is FREAKIN ABSURD. Square-enix probably figured that if they didn't have all this nonsensical grinding, the game would be 5-10 hours shorter, making it less valuable in the eyes of consumers. Either that or they just really hate completionists. Is an extended vacation in Grind Pulse necessary? Not really. Sure battles will be more difficult, but that can make them more appealing. Despite my issues with this portion of the game, I appreciate its inclusion.\n\nIn all fairness, this method of getting the strongest weapons is somewhat an improvement over FF10's. I mean hell, would you rather dodge 200 lightning bolts? Collect those godforsaken butterflies? Ride a chocobo and get those crazy balloons? Turtle-grinding gets zero points for imagination, but at least it's less hateful than soul-sucking, marriage-destroying, world-ending minigames from satan's party-hole.\n\nI actually grew to like the main cast of FF13. The ever-popular Sazh is naturally my favorite of the group, but everyone else comes into their own....eventually. The villains are throwaway trash however. I don't even blink when they're introduced and then unceremoniously discarded. Space Pope is pretty decent, but he's not even a factor for most of the game. I guess it's a side-effect when the first several hours are spent just trying to figure out what the hell is going on. There are a handful of other characters, like the tough mom, woman who wears a bikini to battle, some freedom fighters, a guy, and....yeesh. I can't remember any of these geeks.\n\nI shouldn't have to mention this, because you already know, but Square-enix did a crap job on the port. Durante and his Gedosato program bailed SE out, as FF13 looks really nice at 4K, downsampled, or whatever other high resolution you can force. The frame-rate is still horrendous. At least an update is scheduled for next month. It's too little too late in my case, but I can't complain too much. I just played through the game didn't I? Oh well.\n\nSpeaking of...why didn't I quit this game? This has been bugging me ever since I finished my play-through. I went from hating FF13 to liking it. Both times I knew exactly what I was getting into. Maybe it was a change of attitude. Maybe I realized that the glass can be half-full (of corridors). FF13 definitely requires an investment. For a long-time FF fan like myself it was severely off-putting, but I stuck with it, and I'm kinda glad I did. The battle-system is fantastic, the music is excellent, the characters and story...have their moments. Overall this is a very solid entry.\n\nGetting $5 worth of card drops was nice too I suppose.","November 11, 2014","true","39.1"," 202 of 275 people (73%) found this review helpful 13 people found this review funny","73","202","275","13","2"

But I didn't, lets list some pros and cons.\n\nPros: +Beautiful locations and environments.\n+Good music, kind of a no brainer in a Final Fantasy game. Few memorable songs but no bad ones that I remember.\n+Interesting world and mythos.\n+The overall story is interesting and I wanted to see how it ended.\n+Combat system is fun.  For the first couple of hours.\n+60 fps.\n+1080p and several other graphical updates such as CSAA and better shadows using GeDoSaTo.\n\nCons: -Pacing is at a snails pace which I can forgive if the story is actually moving along. But chapters 2-10 (game has 13 chapters) can be summed up as such:\n\nMain characters running from the police with no clear objective and regularly argue about what they should do so the party has an excuse to split up into groups of 2 or 3 every couple of hours..\n\n-Character motivation is pretty non exsistant for the most part so it's hard to know why characters do things when they do them.\n\n-Story is filled with plot convenience. Example:  In the last chapter most of the main cast turns into monsters but then they just randomly appear 1 minute later even though they talk about people not being able to turn back earlier in the game. The game doesn't even explain how they did it.\n\n-Native resolution locked at 720p.\n\n-No native graphics options.\n\n-Combat soon becomes a matter of only changing classes and mashing auto-attack.\n\n-You can only control one character in battle. If he/she dies it's game over. This is maybe the games worst sin, next to not being able to switch out characters during battle. The reason this is bad is because, well lets imagine this:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEnemy is charging up a nuke.\nYou start to buff up everone to take the hit.\nThe character you are controlling dies but your tank survives.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBut wait, the game forces you to control the character with the least health.\nWhy doesn't the game let me switch control to the surviving members once the character I'm controlling dies?\n\n-Some characters are so annoying you will want to end your existence.  I'm looking at you Vanille.\n\n-Game is one big hallway with no exploration and treasure chests are just laying there in your path taking away all satisfaction of obtaining new items and weapons.\n25 hours into the game you get one field to walk around in. What amazing things can you do here?\nHunting quests, because you haven't been killing things the entire game or anything.\n\n-The game is so linear infact that there are no towns or physical shops to visit, all shopping is done via save points.\n\n-The weapon upgrade system is horrible. Getting new weapons is pointless because if you've been putting all your weapon upgrade items into one weapon you dont want to switch because it takes forever to fully upgrade a single weapon.\n\n-Leveling up system is bad. It's like the Final Fantasy X sphere grid but without the options to choose what new stats/abilities you get. Like the rest of the game this system is so linear it could have just been a normal level up system and the game would have lost nothing of value.\n\nConclusion:\nLike I said in the beginning I really wanted to like this game because of the interesting locations, lore and music but ultimately the lackluster combat and story that gets worse every chapter holds it back a great deal. I will most likely get XIII-2 since I hear they fixed a lot of the linearity problems. But with the game as it is I just can't recommend it to anybody.\n\nTL;DR:  Wasted potential. Badly written story and bad combat in a interesting world with good soundtrack. Bad PC port but can be somewhat fixed via GeDoSaTo.","October 15, 2014","false","44.4"," 576 of 849 people (68%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","68","576","849","7","39"

To get the negatives out of the way, the bulk of the game, especially the critical path, is extremely linear, sometimes even resembling series of interconnected hallways with battles scattered along the way. That said, there is a very rewarding wealth of late-game content awaiting those who can persevere. A huge number of optional side quests and expansive, wide-open areas, in stark contrast to the former half to two thirds of the game. However, as I found out, it is very much worth the wait.\n\nAnd the real core of the experience, and what drove me to keep going to the end (and then some), is the excellent combat system. The battle system is fairly unconventional for a FF game, while still drawing a lot of inspiration from the previous entries, giving a sense of familiarity to series fans, while also making it feel very fresh and different. This difference is something that you may love or hate. Yes, there is a lot of "mash A to win" in the combat here, but once the game finally allows you to experience all of what the combat system has to offer, you'll understand that the addition of an "auto battle" menu option in battle doesn't actually dumb down or simplify the tried and true Final Fantasy combat, but instead shifts the tactical focus to clever use of the "paradigm shift" mechanic at the right times to dole out the damage, buff/debuff, heal, etc. What this ultimately means is FFXIII offers as much tactical potential in its combat as the previous games in the series, while making it feel much faster-paced and intense. It is extremely unfortunate that the game forcibly holds your hand for nearly 10 hours before finally letting you really get an idea of what this combat can offer, and another 15-20 hours on top of that to really let you go nuts with it, but if you can stick it out, you will be rewarded greatly.\n\nVisually, the game is still incredible looking, regardless of the fact that it came out nearly 5 years ago. The music is excellent as well, almost across the board, as is usually the case with the Final Fantasy series. As for the story and characters, it's a mixed bag, and definitely something that will differ based on personal tastes. For me, I didn't find much substance in either. There are certainly some flashy moments here and there, but I mainly looked forward to getting back to combat any time a cutscene popped up.\n","January 4, 2015","true","36.9"," 115 of 151 people (76%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","76","115","151","2","9"

Here you go.\n\n(Skip to the bottom to see a summary of my review, and the improvements/drawbacks of the PC version compared to the console versions.)\n\nShould you buy this game? If you can enjoy a game for the visuals, music, and innovative battle system, then look no further. This game is for you. The sound and music are great, and despite it being 720p (no longer an issue) it looks fantastic compared to the console versions (I played it first on the PS3). The cutscenes are beautifully rendered. The battle system is fluid and gets quite fun at higher levels once you understand how it works (it's MUCH more complex than it initially seems).\n\nYou'll enjoy this game if you can look past the flaws it has--namely the confusing plot, a few cheesy characters (In the English version at least. I'm looking at you, Vanille and Hope), and extreme linearity (Corridor Simulator of the Year). That being said, I still think it's worth playing FFXIII if for no other reason than to prepare for the FAR SUPERIOR FF XIII-2, which will be coming to Steam in the following months is also available on Steam. That game fixes a lot of these issues and has a better plot in my opinion, but you'll need to be familiar with the story in this game in order to understand what's going on in XIII-2.\n\nEspecially considering the price, this game is one of the best JRPGS you'll find on Steam (granted there aren't many...yet). But you have to go into it expecting the flaws I mentioned above. If you can look past them, you'll enjoy it. Final Fantasy XIII has never looked better, even at 720p. However, if you're looking for a plot that will move you, deep characters, or an open world to explore, this is probably not what you're looking for.\n\nPros:\n+Fantastic visuals\n+Fantastic soundtrack\n+Interesting battle system (requires a fair bit of time to get used to)\n+Lightning is cool\n+Sazh is awesome\n+Good controller support. But you need to change the option in the settings to display Controller prompts rather than keyboard prompts.\n\nCons:\n-What on earth is going on in the story? I still can't really tell you.\n-Too many hallways/corridors to run through during the first half, though it does open up a bit more after 20 hours. You may develop Claustrophobia before then, though.\n-Vanille and Hope. You'll see what I mean. Although they're far less cheesy if you use Japanese audio.\n\nLength: 40-50 hours depending on your speed and how much of the side stuff you complete.\n\nPC version improvements:\n+Higher frame rate than the console versions (60 fps)\n+Japanese audio! The US console versions did not include this feature.\n+Possibility of mods. Who knows, maybe someone can mod Vanille and Hope out of the game entirely.\n(This list will be updated if I discover more.)\n\nPC version drawbacks:\n-It's only 720p. This is a bit of a disappointment, and hopefully it will be patched or modded to run in higher resolutions. Though it still looks much better than console versions. Download GeDoSaTo to run it in higher resolutions.\n-The Esc button exits the game. This is beyond annoying. Mod please!\n(This list will be updated if I discover more.)\n\nClosing remarks: Buy this game if you have ANY desire AT ALL to see Final Fantasy XV or Kingdom Hearts III on Steam one day. Although I say that half-seriously, there is some truth to it. If this series sells well and Square Enix sees that there is enough demand for their console games on PC, it only makes sense that other previously console-exclusive games will follow.","October 9, 2014","true","26.4"," 295 of 434 people (68%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","68","295","434","2","11"

In my view it was boringly average. I didn't enjoy the combat system and the story never really connected with me, which are two elements the game really is built upon.\n\nThere is a lot of depth in the battle system but the game takes far too long teaching you how it works before it really gets fun. It isn't a 20 hour tutorial but expect the first 3-6 chapters (depending on how many jrpgs you have played) to be tutorials.\n\nThe story has some cringeworth dialogue (Snow will never be likeable in my eyes) but the characters do change in interesting ways and there are alot of cool ideas here, I just feel like it was lost amongst many Terms and Names. It will take several chapters (for me about 6) before you really start to grasp what is going on.\n\nI would never go out of my way to suggest this game to someone, it really doesn't do a lot for me.\nIf someone did come up to me saying they were intrigued by this game and wanted to know my opinion I would tell them to pick it up on a sale however since they may fall in love with it.\n\nLike FF X and FF VIII and FFXII, it is a love it or hate it type game. Just know that the first 6 hours can be really rough and painful, but those who stick with it will be rewarded with one of the most deceptivly unique battle systems in a video game. Never before has turn based gameplay felt so fast and intense.","August 9, 2015","false","47.0"," 168 of 241 people (70%) found this review helpful 15 people found this review funny","70","168","241","15","6"

Very exhilarating.\n-Many beautiful locations in the game. No stone was left unturned as far as visuals go.\n-Many different enemy npcs. Encounters rarely become repetitive.\n-Excellent pacing. There is like 5 hours worth of cutscenes in the game. Its all mixed very well with the gameplay.\n-Lots of crazy unexpected boss fights which require precise button mashing. Very intense. Much sweaty palms.\n-The music is great. Some stuff seemed a bit repetitve but the battle themes and boss fight themes were really good.\n-Difficulty is just right. Not too hard and not too easy.\n-The last couple chapters in the game was really good.\n-Choice of Japanese or English audio.\n\n\n\nCONS\n\n-The story can be a bit vague at times. Some ingame datalog reading is required to get a better grip on things.\n-Some of the characters are kind of bad. But they turn out to be so useful in combat you will eventually like them.\n-Can't customize clothes on playbable characters. They're all dressed like a bunch of bums.\n-Lazy port with no video settings. (patched 2 months after release)\n\n\n\n\nI don't understand why there is so much hatred for this game. The Final Fantasy fanbase can be very repulsive sometimes for whatever reason. I guess this is one of those games people really love to hate. I found very little wrong with it. Its not perfect by any means but as far as quality goes this is probably the best 15 bucks you can spend on steam right now. The attention to detail and art design from Square Enix is just extraordinary. The whole experience is filthy rich from start to finish. Its one of very few modern day AAA Japanese games.

FFXIII seems to be a divisive game for people, with a lot of fans of the old games hating the linearity of this one, and some or all of the characters in 13.\n\nRegarding the linearity, it is incredibly linear for most of the game, with you just running along straight paths fighting enemies. Once you get to chapter 11 it opens up and you can explore and run around in this massive field (you even get a chocobo to ride to get around faster), with these huge dinosaur turtle creatures and sh*t you can fight. This is a really cool area, but if you really don’t like the linearity of the game I wouldn’t recommend you buy it and persevere till you get to that part. There are 13 chapters in the game and that is the 11th, which is more than 30 hours through the game! You are close to the end at that point, I honestly wondered why they even had an open section at all, I was used to the linear paths.\n\nI don’t usually play turn based RPG’s so I have nothing to compare the combat system in this to, but it does a good job of easing you into it, at first it’s a cake walk, I had no issues for the first 10 hours. There are 6 main characters you get to play as, but in battles you can only equip 3, but at the beginning as the characters split up, you go between fighting with 3 equipped to only being able to use 2 at some points for story reasons. This gave me some trouble early on, with one or two boss fights, like most RPG’s grinding would make those encounters a lot easier.\n\nI had to use a guide to defeat some bosses later on, there really seemed to be only 1 or 2 methods that worked on them and if you don’t know what you’re doing you could be there hours without a guide, but most of the time I had no problem, though I did grind for a few hours to level my characters up (also with a guides help to find the best places to grind).\n\nThere is a ton of secondary boss fight missions you can attempt once you get to chapter 11 (63 in total I think) so there is plenty here for you to do, I put in 70 hours at the time of writing this and I still have about 5 missions left to do. If you don’t feel like doing those then you should be able to complete the main story in 55 – 60 hours.\n\nI bought this game for the story more than the combat, and this is the other area people have a problem with. I liked the characters, but some people had issues with Lightning being stoic through the whole story, but the other 5 characters all have different personalities, and each of them has their own story and arc through the game, so even if you don’t like Lightning or find her boring, the story is always shifting between all 6. This is really an ensemble cast of characters, even though they heavily promoted Lightning in all the marketing/trailers and covers for the game. In the first game it's an ensemble anyway, in the second one you might only get to play as her sister, and in the third you may only get to play as lightning (though they do feature the other 5 characters in the story still).\n\nThis should go without saying but the game looks visually amazing, and the architecture and creature design is unique to a Japanese mindset, so as a westerner I enjoyed it. There are many CGI cut scenes throughout, which I enjoyed because I got the game for the story, but if you only want gameplay and minimal story that could be an issue for you.\n\nThe port has some issues, outside of combat I would get 60fps if I turned off the mini map, in combat it dropped to 30, I noticed it dropped as low as 24fps once or twice. I tried a few different methods to try and fix it and none of them worked. This wasn’t an issue for me because the game’s turn based, so the camera is in a semi fixed position when fighting, it didn’t really bother me when playing. NOTE: my pc is pretty good (I7,R9 290), if you have a mid or low range PC it might not run as well for you.\n\nIf you found this review helpful then spin around in your chair, if you don’t have a chair that can spin then do what I do and drink heavily until the world starts to spin for you.","April 16","true","71.1"," 45 of 52 people (87%) found this review helpful 7 people found this review funny","87","45","52","7","7"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/recommended/292120/","nerdhouse","Nerd House","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nerdhouse/","2628 products in account","The Final Fantasy fanbase is a bunch that cannot make up it’s mind. With each new installment, you have a faction of the fanbase who wants the old, classic ATB battle system back. Then you also have the faction that wants something new and edgy. Anytime Square-Enix delivers one or the other, the fanbase causes an uproar….wanting the other! With this in mind, know that with Final Fantasy XIII….you will either love it or hate it, depending on which faction you belong to.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII is a great game.\n\nIt's fairly linear though, but that doesn't hinder it in a bad way. It actually brings the story to the forefront of the game experience. Final Fantasy X was exactly the same, but is praised by fans as being one of the best FF titles to date (very close to VII), while FFXIII got a lot of hate after it’s initial release. Why is FFXIII different?\n\nThat's the thing: It's not!\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII takes place in a society called Cocoon, which exists in a large sphere that hangs in the sky over the world of Pulse. The citizens live in constant fear of invasion from the surface after an attack centuries earlier cracked open the shell of their world, and rely entirely on the fal'Cie, godlike creatures that provide Cocoon with everything it needs to exist — food, weather...even light. While Cocoon's fal'Cie are revered as benevolent protectors, the fal'Cie of Pulse are feared and demonized, to the point that anyone who comes in contact with anything from Pulse is considered tainted. When a Pulse fal'Cie is discovered in their own society, a chain of events leads the government to purge an entire city of civilians, and leads six strangers to become l'Cie, servants of the Pulse fal'Cie who must complete their appointed task or suffer a fate worse than death.\n\nThe story is fast-paced and filled with mysteries that unravel as the game progresses, and it's paced perfectly, with cutscenes popping up as you move through each area. The characters are also fantastic, each presenting themselves as a typical JRPG archetype in the beginning, but quickly showing much more depth. Furthermore, each character is tied to the story of the game; there are no incidental characters filling out your party, and likewise there is no main character. Final Fantasy XIII is about the overall group, and this is further emphasized by dividing them into separate groups on separate paths before they join together again for the second half.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII's weakest link is unfortunately the beginning. The first few hours of the game see keywords like Pulse, l'Cie, and fal'Cie thrown at you without any context or explanation to their meaning. The characters also lack any kind of development for the first few hours, and the result is a confusing plotline with uninteresting characters that leaves a terrible first impression.  The combat system is completely stripped of the depth is shows later on. The player barely needs to pay attention for these early battles, and coupled with some extremely linear level design, the first three hours are unquestionably a low-point for both the game and the series.\n\nAnd then Final Fantasy XIII really begins. The Crystarium, the game's answer to leveling up, becomes available, and likewise so does the Paradigm system, the meat and potatoes of Final Fantasy XIII's combat system. When this all becomes available, it becomes readily apparent why you've been spamming "Auto-Battle", and why you'll continue to spam it for the next fifty hours. The combat isn't about the nitty-gritty details of individual spells, it's about the overall strategy. Just as Final Fantasy XII gave you control through gambits, Final Fantasy XIII lets you play the general in the same way by rapidly changing between sets of classes in the heat of battle, altering tactics to suit the ever-changing situations that come up. The AI is extremely intelligent, and can select appropriate skills faster and with as much efficiency as most players, anyways.\n\nEach character has access to three primary classes, and the Paradigm system allows you to create customized class set-ups that you can switch between at any time during combat. If you're on the offensive, a Commando and two Ravagers can effectively decimate an enemy. If you're looking at a longer fight, a Saboteur/Synergist team can drastically increase your fighting power. Facing a powerful foe? Bring out a Sentinel and let them tank while the other two lay the hurt on. Each class has a unique and important purpose, and while most fights can be completed with different strategies, many of the boss fights require rather specific ones in order to be successful.\n\nThe environments aren't the only amazing visuals Final Fantasy XIII boasts; the character/enemy models should not be sold short. The characters easily have some of the most realistic and believable facial expressions ever produced in a video game. Every emotion the characters experience is mirrored flawlessly on their face, and while the designs retain a hint of anime influence, they are still shockingly realistic.\n\nOf course, this realism would be marred without solid vocal support, and for the most part Final Fantasy XIII delivers it. While not quite approaching the level of quality seen in Final Fantasy XII, the vocal cast of XIII nonetheless perform admirably, and this in spite of the lengthy monologues each character performs on a regular basis, true to form for a JRPG. The only weak point in the vocals is Vanille, which in the early parts of the game is rather grating. To her credit, the performance improves dramatically.\n\nThe musical score is also excellent. The main battle theme is similarly exciting and gets stuck in your head easily. While wandering dungeons, the music gets a bit more eclectic. Other tracks deviate from the usual, melodic Final Fantasy style and delve instead into techno and other styles.\n\nLike Final Fantasy XII before it, Final Fantasy XIII has unquestionably caused cause a rift between those who love it and those who don't. As long as you don't judge the game on its beginning, Final Fantasy XIII is a game worthy of the series, and a terrific game.\n\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=383116499\n\nHighly Recommended\nBe sure to check out Nerd House Gaming for more reviews!","October 9, 2014","true","150.6"," 877 of 1,397 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","877","1","0","46"

The cinematics (which make up more then half the game) are extremely well done, and still look great today.   My only gripe is that the PC port shipped at 720p and you need to download an addon to make it play at 1080.

Į hated it at some point too, but in the end i fell in love with it. I love Final Fantasy series and FFXIII is no exception.\n\nMany people complain about it being a bad port. Yes there‘re some fps drops. It‘s either 60fps or 30fps usually. Lowest i‘ve seen was ~20fps. It‘s no matter what PC you have, fps will drop anyway. But it‘s not a big problem for me. The game still looks beautiful, you want to take screenshot after screenshot. And it plays well too. Considering the price i think the port is good. It costs less or the same as some short, small indie games. Yes it is a port of an old game, but you can‘t expect developers to redo everything and release it at the current price of 13€. I‘m thankful to SE and i hope to see FFXV on steam someday.\n\nBattle system has changed since the last Final fantasy games. The battle system In final fantasy XIII is faster and less boring. I‘m not saying the battle system was bad in previous games, but i really like this new faster system. Now you have paradigms which you need to change constanly in a fight. Maybe it looks not so fun at the start, but when you finally get to the chapter 11 where you can start hunting monsters it gets really interesting and fun. You need think of a strategies for different enemies. Buffs and debuffs means a lot in this game. You can‘t beat a strong enemy without them.\n\nPeople also complain about it being only corridors. Yes it is in a way, but as i remember previous FF games were linear too. This doesn‘t bother me. You run, you fight enemies to get stronger and get more money. Same as in other rpg‘s.\n\nMaybe the game is not very good as Final fantasy title, because there‘s barely anything left in common with the series, but as a jrpg it‘s good. I loved it and i recommend it to everyone who wants to play a beautifully looking game with a pretty good (but very frustrating story at times), fun battle system and interesting characters and of course awesome cut-scenes.","February 4, 2015","true","69.6"," 75 of 108 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","75","108","0","8"

Admittedly, being a PC-exclusive gamer for the last decade or so, I haven't played too many JRPGs lately, and I was frankly thrilled to finally be able to play a modern Final Fantasy game on PC. Final Fantasy VI (SNES) is one of my favorite games of all time, and I've briefly played but never beat (rented back in the day) FF 7, 8 and 9.\n\nThe game is as linear as they say, but I didn't really have a problem with it. I play Final Fantasy games primarily for the story and spectacle, and then the battles, and then very distantly the out-of-battle gameplay sections. FF13 performs strongly in the first two, so being pretty much completely linear for most of the game isn't really that big of a deal. I really enjoyed the story, and though some have complained that it's confusing or hard to follow, I found it easy enough to understand (though I did read all of the datalogs religiously, which definitely helps).\n\nSome stuff I really enjoyed are some new "convenience features" that basically remove most of the things I find annoying about JRPGs. Namely:\n-No random battles! You can see (and usually avoid) any enemy on the world map.\n-Your party is automatically healed and cured at the end of every battle (so you don't have to micromanage all that stuff yourself all the time)\n-If you die in battle, you can restart the battle immediately to try again, and it even starts you outside of battle so you can change your party/upgrades/paradigms or just run away. This even applies to boss battles!\n-No grinding - the game is somewhat challenging (though there's also an easy mode you can switch to at any time), but I never felt the need to stay in one area and grind experience before moving on. Grinding is boring and it's exclusion will not be missed.\n\nThe battle system is really novel. You only control one character, and you have an "auto-attack" option (though you can still individually choose your attacks if you want). There are 6 different roles, and a combination of these roles is a paradigm. The main focus of battle is switching up your paradigms for the situation, sort of macro-managing the battle rather than micromanaging every single move. I found this quite an enjoyable change of pace from the same battle system that's been in FF for years.\n\nAs an aside: yes, the port is horrible, and it's absolutely shameful that they'd lock such a beautiful game to 720p. Fortunately this is easily fixed with the program "GeDoSaTo" (created by legendary modder Durante, who also fixed Dark Souls 1). The framerate is weirdly inconsistent during battles (bouncing between 30 and 60, despite sitting at like 30% GPU load, and 10% CPU load) but it wasn't enough to put me off from playing the game.\n\nOverall I enjoyed my time spent with FF13. The game is absolutely gorgeous, especially at 1080p (I've taken several hundred screenshots during my playthrough), the story and characters are interesting (except Snow, ♥♥♥♥ that guy), and the battle system is fun and novel. My JRPG experience is admittedly a bit lacking, but I loved them back in the SNES days, and if FF13 is anything to go by, I still love them now.","October 27, 2014","true","57.4"," 99 of 148 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","99","148","0","0"

Although it's a very linear game, it's still very enjoyable. At first you might think this game is just pressing x (auto-battle) constantly, win the battle, rinse, repeat, but just wait until you reach the part where the crystarium is unveiled. Basically after each battle you earn Crystogen Points and you use them to unlock abilities and stats on the Crystarium, which is a sort of FFX sphere grid. There are also 6 different roles, each of them having their own abilities, stats, and different magics. So for example you can assign one character the role of physical attacker, the other one might be a healer, and the last one might be a support character. Or maybe you want two attackers and one magic user! You choose their roles, and the beauty of it is that one character might have several roles in just one battle (especially the end-game content.)\n\nIf you're a hardcore rpger, just wait till you get to the endgame content, hunting marks and achievements, I assure you, you will have a great time, especially those bosses where you just can't find the way or tactic to beat them, and then you finally realize which combination of roles to use.

This game in my eyes, is an absolute masterpiece as well as the rest of the trilogy, being a near perfect game that takes me through one of the most incredible adventures I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying. That being said, I will be looking through this game without my incredible love for the game and will analyze and talk about each part of the game. While this game may be the best game in the world for me, most players may see it being around an 8 out of 10.\n\n// Gameplay - Field //\nFirst I'd like to get into the gameplay of this game. Final Fantasy XIII, like most JRPGs and just about every other Final Fantasy game, is a linear journey for a majority of the game. The game has very little areas to branch off and explore into and has a straight path to follow making it so you'll never get lost. Many people hate on this game for this very reason but the thing is, almost every Final Fantasy game is just as linear as Final Fantasy XIII. Look at IV, VI, and VII... some of the most beloved games in the series. The games merely give you the illusion of an open world, but no matter what you do, you're thrown into a world map and given a linear path to follow. You must always go from Town A, to Town B, to Dungeon A, to Town C. The game will force you down the same path every single time. The difference in this game? They don't try to hide it under some pretty world map.\n\n// Gameplay - Combat //\nThe combat in Final Fantasy XIII is completely in real time. When battles start, you will have control over your party leader while the other characters are controlled by good AI. I've never once really felt the need to take control over anyone else. You will have everyone set into a different class known as a paradigm. Before battle, you select up to six paradigms you'd like to go into combat with. For instance, one of your paradigms can include a COM, RAV, RAV which would have a damage dealer focused on slowing down the chain gauge and the casters building it up to eventually generate a stagger to severely weaken the opponent. From this point you can make the decision to keep building that gauge up for heavily increased damage up to 999.9% then switch to a full set of Commandos for absolute punishment that you may or may not have enhanced with a Synergist's Bravery and/or Faith.\n\nCombat in this game is very challenging as you get further in, and what starts off as a simple mashing of the confirm button with occasional Paradigm Shifts, becomes a deep and complex combat system where you will find yourself getting punished if you dare use the auto-battle. Many people complain about Auto-Battling, but the truth of the matter is that Final Fantasy XIII isn't the only game adding this in their games and those who find themselves using it will never beat the game and find themselves experiencing countless deaths, which occur if your party leader dies.\n\nCombat is strategic and wants you to think with a tactical viewpoint. Every enemy has weaknesses and ailments they are vulnurable, or resistant to. Your goal is to discover those weaknesses, and find a way to exploit them. Bosses will require a great deal of strategy later into the game and will stretch your understanding of the combat system to it's limits, especially the 64 mark missions available in the post-story gameplay.\n\nMonsters also don't award Exp or Gil in the traditional RPG sense. Instead they reward something known as CP or Crystogen Points. This can then be used to enhance your character's abilities down 6 massive trees. Each tree represents your paradigm and while you start off with a few at the beginning of the game, you eventually unlock access to all six. Every character has trees they are good at, or bad at and in no instances will you find yourself using Hope as a Commando, however the stat bonuses learned from the trees still make them worth going through once you've mastered the other roles. Every paradigm has a passive ability that stacks with the more of that role you have in combat. If you head in with three Commandos compared to one, you'll find your damage output across all characters MUCH higher. There are also Synthesized Abilities the game never brings up and keeps a shady secret. Essentially these are abilities that are created when you equip a certain combination of a weapon and accessories that belong in a set. Some of these bonuses can be very mild such as adding extra damage with specific elements, to giving you faster ATB recharging, making your attacks heal you, or even making you invincible to physical attacks or magical attacks! The game rewards those who like to play around with different builds and using these synthesized abilities can severely make the difference in some fights between life and death.... As for Gil.... it's the most valuable thing in the world and should NEVER be spent unless absolutely necessary as no monsters drop gil, it is a pain to find. The only way to obtain Gil in this game is to obtain an item that can be sold for a premium and sell it. These items PURELY exist to be the method to bring in Gil, you don't start seeing many of these until a decent bit into the game however... luckily you don't need to really buy anything from the shop for the beginning of the game as most items are easily won from battles.\n\n// Characters //\nThe characters are incredible and have many various personalities and great background stories to each one. I instantly fell in love with these characters, every single one being great and interesting. The game has lots of character development, ESPECIALLY Chapter 7 in the story. Lightning is trying to deal with the fear of being alone and lashes out in anger, Hope tries to deal with losses in his life and revenge. Every character goes through so much, and at the end of their journey, they've become very interesting characters.\n\n// World //\nFinal Fantasy XIII is a sci-fi game, taking place primarily on a large floating world known as Cocoon, which like the name suggests, is a hollow, artificially built world where everyone lives along the inside shell. Their technology is much more advanced thanks to the Fal'Cie, a race of machines with god-like power. The game has many terms you will learn as the game goes on and gives such a great immersive experience. The designs of the world, airships, airbikes, and much more are so interesting and the world itself is an absolute beauty, especially after reaching Chapter 11 where you're dropped off in the untamed wilderness of Gran Pulse, the lowerworld much more like our own in the manner that it's a planet and not an artificially made shell.\n\n// Mythos and Story //\nThe trilogy heavily revolves around the Fabula Nova Crystallis Mythology, and while it isn't required, it is HEAVILY advised you go brush up on this mythos and possibly the official Novella Episode Zero before going into the game to have some knowledge of the backstory to this game. The game has two stories, the story of the gods, and the story of our party. And while this game focuses on the characters, the true story is the struggles and battles between these gods and truly knowing the mythos, opens up eyes as the game, instead of being a story of fugitives running from the government, becomes a story about our party and their influence with these gods and their battles. The story is deep, complex and the most incredible story I have ever found myself enjoying and while it is difficult to get into as many people don't even realize there is this mythology and backstory behind it, if you go in looking for it and wanting to learn more about this world, it won't disappoint you.\n\nWonderful game that I would heavily recommend to anyone who enjoys a good story and wonderful music. Lacks many PC options players expect, but will be added in soon. Do yourself a favor if you enjoy stories, characters, and music and buy this game.","November 25, 2014","true","27.2"," 78 of 119 people (66%) found this review helpful","66","78","119","0","2"

Port them better and give your players options and the money will follow. Think about the player experience first and as a result you as developers will be rewarded handsomely every time by the loyalty of your fans; provide us the service we expect from great developers like you. Looking forward to the future titles with the improvements listed below if you decide that this game doesn't deserve your attention!\n\nSUPPORT CUSTOM RESOLUTIONS!\n1080p support at a minimum! Some people have weird monitors with weird Aspect Ratios. This stuff is important!\n-This game needs to use multithreading (using more than a single CPU core), because that is the core issue behind the unstable framerate. That is the priority because even if they add 1080p without fixing this issue first, you will have 1080p with 30-60 frames skipping wherever they want anyway, like it is right now. Most people here at the bare minimum use a Quad-Core CPU, and thus would like to put it to full use, even Alan Wake which came out on PC a few years ago makes full use of all cores in multicore CPU's. The game is being bottlenecked by only utilizing a single core, so no matter how strong your graphic card may be, the game will struggle to run even on high-end machines.\n\nFULL SET OF GRAPHICS OPTIONS!\nAllow users to change Antialiasing, Anisotropic Filtering, V-sync, Shadow Resolution etc.\n-Better optimization for the game so that it can run better for different graphic cards (AMD, Nvidia). Some people run it perfectly fine without any issues, and some people can't run it at all due to unplayable frame rates and other graphical issues.\n\nLET USERS CHOOSE WHICH LANGUAGE THEY WANT TO DOWNLOAD!\nThe Dual Audio support is a welcome feature, but you've nearly doubled the size of the download! 60GBs is no joke! I'd like to be able to right-click the game in my library, and have the option to uncheck Japanese Audio. Simple! Or have an optional DLC download for the people that want the extra option. For free of course.\n\nREPLACE THE CURRENT CUTSCENES WITH PS3 QUALITY CUTSCENES!!!\nWhen FFXIII was released on XBOX360, the cut scenes were downgraded to fit the smaller disk size. Why have you done the same here!? It will take up even more HDD space to have better quality cut scenes and some people might not like that, so create an option of an HD High Resolution Texture Pack DLC, another free DLC; giving your customers options is a good thing.\n\nENABLE FORCE FEEDBACK FOR SUPPORTED GAMEPADS\nThe Vibration/Rumble on controllers seem to add a little more suspense to the gameplay and cutscenes, as you already know I'm sure; since the console versions supported it, why not here?\n\nSquare, you need to fix these problems. I have some predictions about what's going to happen here. You're going to see articles on Kotaku, Polygon, GameSpot,‎ etc. about what a terrible port this is, and about how modder’s have to step in and fix a game for your customers again. I think you'd rather not have that? I'm not going to pretend that I know how easy or hard it is to fix these problems, but I doubt it's beyond your abilities.\n\nGameSpot has created a good video indicating the major issues as well: http://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiii-for-pc-has-basically-no-graphic/1100-6422856/\n\nIf you would just dedicate a few extra work hours to fixing these problems, you could change the reviews on the store page from "MOSTLY NEGATIVE" to "MOSTLY POSITIVE". If you deliver on this it will pay off, I promise you.\n\nMany people who purchased this game will not purchase the sequels and many who are on the verge of purchasing this product; will not because of the reasons listed above.\nPlease Square Enix, we all know you can make things right!","October 15, 2014","true","51.7"," 78 of 122 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","78","122","0","4"

The FPS also really depends on your computer, that's all.\nThe keyboard/mouse controls are fine too? It's just the regular wasd+mouse that you can actually change settings and keybindings for anyway? The menus are easy as hell to navigate for me too (out or in combat), so I have no clue why people are whining about this. Like literally, the thing you do in combat is just go through menus. And it works great with kb/m. It's not like this is a hack n slasher or anything.\n\nWhile I do like when the games I play are pretty, I don't buy them to play with the graphics settings. I buy games to play the THE GAME ITSELF. Besides, to me the game looks pretty as hell already. So anyway if you're the same and don't play for graphics, just go ahead and buy the game. Otherwise, you might wanna consider finding something better to do, because this whining is ridiculous lol.\n\nGAMEPLAY/STORY/ETC: Storywise I can't say much yet, but I'm really enjoying the game so far. I've only played one other older FF game, so the change in the combat system was interesting, and for me, in a good way. I wish the game wasn't as linear as it is but it's not that of a big deal for me personally.\nAlso the music. I LOVE the music in this game. And yeah there's quite a lot of cinematics to watch but hey, me? I'm not complaining. I really love the style the game has so I love watching them as much as playing the game itself.\n\nMight edit this more later but my final say is?

I finished it without getting all achievements because I'm sure I'll play the game again one day. Here are my thoughts on overall quality of Final Fantasy XIII:\n\n\nWhen I first started playing this game, I felt just the same confusion as with every other game in the series. I had no idea what it's all about, and I only knew that I'm controlling Lightning, and a black dude with a chicken is following me. Just like all FF titles before, FF13 revealed the plot much later, and assembled a gallery of very interesting characters. A couple of plot-holes here and there are something Final Fantasy players are already used to, so I can't say everything is perfect. If you have ever played (and liked) any of the Final Fantasy games' stories, you'll like this one as well.\n\nThe graphics are awesome, and beautiful. The wide variety of monsters, enemies and bosses is great, and the main characters, as well as all others, are well designed and interesting.\nI've read a lot about stuttering and graphics-related problems online, but I had no such problems while playing in 1080p maxed out.\n\nMusic is not as spectacular as a FF-fan would expect, but it's still not bad. It just seems a little... poor.\nOn the upside, voice acting is great, so we can easily forget about weird and awkward scenes like the HAHAHAHA scene form Final Fantasy X!\n\nIf you like using a controller, you'll hate the game in the first couple of hours. It doesn't support many controllers, so the mappings are a little weird, but you can easily get used to them. A big con is that the game didn't any re-mapping options. It's okay, but I can imagine many players get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ as hell because of this.\n\n\nSo, to come to the conclusion:\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII is a wonderful game, with lots of gameplay, missions, interesting characters, mediocre music, and bad gamepad-controls. Whoever said it's a bad game, or a bad port should stick to Call of Duty, because this is no game for them.\n\nPersonally, I liked it, and I'll most definitely play it again.\n\n\nMy score: 8.7/10","June 17, 2015","true","42.7"," 36 of 50 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","36","50","3","3"

It's very different from other Final Fantasy games, which I found immensely disappointing, and that put me in a mood where I couldn't appreciate anything the game had to offer because none of it is what I was looking to get out of it. It also annoyed me that the game launched with some performance/graphics issues.\n\nSo, why recommend it? I came back to this game a year later with a totally different set of expectations. Instead of treating this as a typical Final Fantasy game, and thus expecting things like towns, an overworld, the attack/magic/item combat, leveling, Cid, Biggs and Wedge references, etc. (none of which this game has), I chose to approach this as if it were an interactive visual novel with a light Final Fantasy flavor. With all the chatty cutscenes and linearity, that's exactly what it feels like, and if you come in expecting it then this game is actually quite satisfying.\n\ntl;dr: Very nice game if you're looking for a visual novel with a heavy focus on combat and some light Final Fantasy themes.

The linear structure keeps the game very focused and story-driven, and I enjoyed many of the cutscenes scattered throughout the game. The pacing of this game is quite good imo. Usually just when you were starting to get bored with the constant forward-running and fighting, there was a beautiful cutscene to move the story forward. The graphics, in a word: GORGEOUS, even though this is already a 5-year-old game.\n\nThe story itself is a mixed bag, though. The Fabula Nova Crystallis lore is interesting and detailed, and the plot of FF13 explores it quite thoroughly, especially in the well-written datalog entries. Even still, the dialogue in this game is often bad or so-so, with poorly hidden exposition every once in a while, characters explaining self-evident facts, and being all-around jerks. I cannot count how many times I facepalmed during Snow's "Self-proclaimed hero" -rants. Some of this has to do with the voice acting (which is generally good, though), but a lot of the writing is a bit clumsy and not very clever. On a broader level, the plot of the game was intense and interesting.\n\nThe thing that kept me going, though, was the intense, strategic, increasingly rewarding and (imo) absolutely fantastic battle system of FF13. I cannot stress this enough. Without a battle system as good as this, I doubt I would have become so hooked on this game. Characters have different roles to fullfill in battle (physical attacker, mage, medic and so on) and you can freely combine these in different battle paradigms. The "paradigm shift" system, which requires the player to change the roles of each character in your party according to different situations in battle, is pretty much the most intense and fun battle system in the Final Fantasy series, if you take your time to master it. Different characters have different specialities in battle, and combining those specialities in an effective way is the main challenge of this game. Final Fantasy 13 is HARD, especially near the end, and requires you to really explore the battle system and master it to take down some really tough foes (with millions and millions of hit points). Finally taking down an especially tough enemy that you have tried to kill many times before with various different accessory/paradigm setups is an intensely rewarding experience.\n\nWeapon/accessory upgrading is also a nice touch. Hunting the "Treasure hunter" -trophy, which requires you to hold every weapon and accessory available in the game, is tough and most of my gaming hours consist of trying to achieve this trophy...\n\nI have seen some complaints about the optimizing of this game, but it runs very smoothly with only a few fps drops here and there with my 2,6 ghz, 8 gb ram laptop with a Nvidia Geforce 710M card. No complaints there.\n\nTo sum it up, if you can look past some of the obvious design flaws, this game is very rewarding, challenging and fun.\nScore: 80/100","September 11, 2015","true","369.0"," 30 of 41 people (73%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","73","30","41","3","0"

You might end up on either one of them and I am personaly on the "I like this" no scratch that "I FREAKING LOVE THIS GAME" side. Now than;\n\nIf you are here for a classic ARPG experience (as in: open world, many towns, bunch of NPCs with all sorts of cool or less cool side quests) you are not going to find that here BUT WAIT, DON'T LEAVE YET. The fact that this game is different doesn't mean it's bad.\nYou are not going to find yourself running around through he whole world of Final Fantasy XIII like in previous games, in fact it's ~80% linear experience, you will have to wait a while before the game opens up for you. Where the game opens up is in Chapter 11, you will get to explore pretty big area(s) with challanging content, you will get to form your own team and strategize alot during tough battles in side quests (if you choose to do them and honestly, you should do at least some of them or you are not going to be able to progress in chapter 12 IMO).\nBut getting to Chapter 11 will take you 20-30 hours (depending on your play style) and the first 10 chapters is just "hold A to win" type of gameplay.\nBut the story will keep pushing you forward! And my oh my, if you like well written stories you might like this one. It's a bit confusing at the begining, you have no idea who you are and who the people you meet are. You don't know what you are doing here and what's happening, but keep on going and you will uncover everything. Don't forget to read logs often because in these you'll find even more information that will help clear things up for you. And really check the logs often, because logs about people you meet often change, you don't want to miss out.\nAnd just when you think you know everything, the game still has secrets for you prepared. All in all the story is really strong part of this game, if you find that you don't like it, just keep on going, maybe you'll like it more once you know more.\nThe characters have strong personalities and they go through alot, I got really invisted in most of them and while some may seem bad, I feel that they are like that for a reason.\n\nSince I mentioned the combat already. It's rather simplistic at the begining, you just choose auto-battle, your character is aoutomaticly going to choose what's best to do and it's going to do just that. You are controlling just 1 character all the time while the party have maximum of 3 characters in it. You can't switch to other character to do anything with them, you are pretty much forced to play as the leader all the time. But don't worry, the AI is great, they are not messing up at all. You can choose not to "aouto-battle" and attack however you want by lining up abilities to the queue. If that's what you want to do, just switch the battle in options to slow as you want to have some time to choose how you want to attack. All the characters can have 3 out of 6 different roles (later on all of them, but they are generaly good only in the main 3) and you can switch roles during battle at any time but only to previously created presets (there are 7 presets available that you can modify however you want). So if your starting stance is - Commander, ravanger, ravanger you can switch to Commander, Sentinel, Medic at any time if you have this kind of preset created. And your companions will behave differently in battle. This strategic gameplay makes it not so simplistic anymore and is quite fun to play with. Once you get to chapter 11 it's all just great!\n\nYou will find all sorts of accessories and weapons through the game, they might not look powerful and you are not going to find much better stuff. While your characters are not leveling like in classic RPG game, you can level up your weapons and accessories with items you find after battles. Make your research with weapons. Each character can get many different weapons but they all have similiar starting statistics. But if you level them up to maximum level, they differ alot! You don't want to end up leveling a weapon the whole game only to find out it's the weakest of them all too late.\n\nWhile your characters aren't leveling up, they gain Crystarium Points (or CP) after each battle and with that you can improove them in their roles. It's nothing complex, there's no massive tree where you could mess up your character, it's all straight forward. And you will unlock all abilities here too. All the magic comes from Crystarium, so you are not going to be buying magic or anything like that.\n\nThe game looks amazing! Just great, it's the best looking Final Fantasy game released ATM. I still remember when I've been playing FF VIII many years ago thinking how cool it would be if the game looked like the cutscenes... Well this is even better and I felt like it's a dream coming true. There are many cutscenes that just blew me away with the ammount of creativity in them, the game just looks wonderful.\nThe game even sounds great! What do you expect? It's final fantasy after all. If there's somethign that never change it's the music. I found myself denying faster travel through the locations of Chapter 11 just so I can listen to the wonderfull music there.\n\nDid I tell you how great the story is? I am not spoiling anything here, you should just enjoy it for yourself! I personaly found the story of Final Fantasy XII weak, but on the other hand I prefered the gameplay there more. Here it's wonderful story with weaker gameplay (but with rich elements as I wrote above). I was touched, I was scared, I was happy and sad. The emotions are there and they are not going to go away untill you are back in the main menu after the ending credits.\n\nNow for the main reason you might hate this game. The freaking port. Yeah... it's not great, it's lazy as hell. For reference. I have GTX 780 (MSI OC Gaming edition) and Intel Core i5-4440 3.1GHz. Running at 1080p with maxed out graphical settings (there's not alot of them mind you, shadow resolution, filtering, resolution... And that's about it I believe) the game ran great for the most part (60fps) but I've been dealing with heavy stuttering. That is happening if you don't have USB controller pluged in to your PC. The game is aparently looking for the controller which is causing the stutter. You can fix that by disabling all ""HID-Compliant Devices" in "Device Manager". More info here -> http://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/2it9rz/stuttering_in_ff_xiii_pc_try_this_worked_for_me/\nTHAT you should not have to do no matter what, one big BOO for you Square Enix.\nBut that's not all, in certain areas the game would drop to 30 fps for no bloody reason. Narrow Corridor? suddenly 30 fps. It doesn't make the game not playable but it's frustrating. For me, there were only 2 areas in the game where it dropped below 30fps but only for a few seconds, nothing to really complain about but it makes you wonder "why the hell?".\nOther than that the game ran great on my machine. And I don't think it's getting any better even if you have 10 times better PC than me, aparently the game utilizes only 1 GPU core or whatever (I am not good at this stuff, that's only what I heard on the internet) so it can only get worst if you do not meet recommended requirements. Also aparently on AMD cards it's quite bad, can't comment on that personaly tho.\n\nI still heavily recommend this game! It's bloody cheap for what it has to offer. I mean come on 13€? Yeah I can forgive you the bad port for this price, I would still love to see it running better tho. So even if you are not sure if you'd like this game, it's not going to cost you much to just try it out. It offers many hours of gameplay and I enjoyed every single minnute of this game. Now I don't know what to do, complete all achievement or play XIII-2? Hmm... Anyway. JUST BLOODY BUY IT ALREADY.","January 16, 2015","true","89.0"," 32 of 47 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","32","47","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007522164/recommended/292120/","76561198007522164","Measure","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198007522164/","48 products in account","From what I have gathered, this game is somewhat controversial. I have 3 playthroughs now, looking forward to a 4th, and I would like to bring up a few points and offer my opinions, that potential players might have a better perspective on the game beforehand. This review will be quite lengthy, for there is a lot to cover, even scratching the surface as I am. I assure you there are no story spoilers.\n\nJourney - The game is very linear. The first 80% of the story takes you on a singular path from one locale to the next, with little deviation, before it opens up into the main side-questing hub. (Firsttime players: at this point, I strongly advise following the map and pressing on with the main story for the best experience; there will be plenty of time later to complete this content, and you will be much better prepared.) Those of you looking for a cohesive, story-driven rpg that will keep you glued to your controller for 40 hours before you even get to the endgame, look no further.\n\nStory - An intricate and well-developed plot replete with heroism, hope, despair, and intrigue. Consciously make sure you develop a firm understanding of the terms being used (l'Cie, fal'cie, etc.), or you will find yourself a bit confused often. The game introduces the story in a very logical way, and if you diligently read the journal entries, you may find yourself thoroughly immersed. The characters are very human (if sometimes melodramatic), and the overall experience was satisfying and complete.\n\nPresentation - The polish in this game is quite astounding. The graphical style of the characters seems to deviate just enough from photorealism to avoid the uncanny valley, yet be very believeable; and I found myself often taking time away from the story to just stare at the environments for a bit. The soundtrack is phenomenal, sound design is very pleasing, and the voice acting is absurdly well done. If there was such a thing as a quadruple A title, this would be one.\n\nCombat - Combat starts almost insultingly simple, but evolves into an extremely tactical and customizable aspect of the game. The systems used are quite novel, and somewhat difficult to describe. Your party maximum is 3 members, but you only control the party leader, and the commands you select are executed when your command queue (called ATB gauge, which charges within seconds at a set rate over time) finishes charging. This makes combat a much faster and action oriented experience than the customary Final Fantasy turn-based combat. Another aspect of combat is the paradigm system, wherein you save up to 6 builds (called paradigms in the game) for your party (out of combat) by specifying each member's role. These paradigms can then be cycled through (called paradigm shift) on-the-fly in combat to fit the given situation. There are 6 different role types. Put simply: tank, healing, damage, damage multiplier increasing, debuffing, and buffing. There is a ton of potential for diversity here. In order to survive many battles post-game, careful timing, thoughtful planning, and equipment tailored to the situation will all be required.\n\nProgression - This is one of my favorite things about the game. While the system for leveling up is arguably as linear as the story to a certain degree, it simply cannot be denied that there is a vast and satisfying journey to be had in regards to increasing your party's strength. The game's EXP is used to purchase abilities and stat upgrades from giant role 'skill/stat trees' (for lack of a better term). All 6 roles have their own trees, and eventually become accessible to everyone, but each character is 'native' to specific roles, meaning that progression with EXP through their native trees is much cheaper. This essentially means that your characters will be limited in their individual role capabilities until you are well past the end of the story. Maxing out each tree is possible, but it is an extremely daunting goal that will take many hours of post-game play to achieve, so there is a certain definite replayability in the way you level up your characters. At a certain point, you can also decide which 3 of 6 party members you utilize as your active party, and who you use as party leader (all of which can be changed at any time, once available). The role trees will be your primary source of progression, but upgrading weapons will increase their damage stat (there are 2 damage stats: strength and magic) boosts, and earlier in the game you will also find it useful to use accessories to boost your stats.\n\nEndgame - As mentioned earlier, some of the endgame content is actually accessible before you finish the story. The trick here is that most of the encounters in this area will either leave you sweating by the end, or simply have you die within the first 10 seconds from a single blow. There are 64 side quests in the game, with some of them actually being woven into and required to complete for the main story. Each quest is essentially a boss enemy you are tasked with hunting down, and the 'quest givers' (term used to avoid plot details) are spread throughout a great portion of the game. To offset this, there is a fast travel network you unlock as you complete certain quests. Generally, the higher the quest number, the more difficult the boss and the better the item and EXP rewards. The fact that there are enemies that can simply wipe the floor with you by hardly trying is one of the things that makes this such a fun experience for me. Because eventually, if you do enough side quests, farm some of the more lucrative quests (quests are repeatable), and obtain the right equipment, you will eventually be more than a match for that enemy. And those groups you were sweating to beat when the quest hub unlocked will die in seconds. Other activities aside from questing include working at completing a robust set of achievements, upgrading your weapons to their ultimate forms (very expensive), upgrading your accessories, and maxing out role trees.\n\nReplayability - As mentioned earlier, there is some replayability value in the design of the role tree system, and which 3 characters you choose to have your experience with when the feature is unlocked. There is also a choice to make for each character: that is if you are specializing them for strength or magic or both, in regards to weapon choice. Some characters may be more naturally inclined to one stat over the other, but it's still your choice. Personally, I think that perhaps the story itself is one of the greatest advocates for replayability. Despite its extreme linearity, it was an amazing and intense journey that I look back fondly on.\n\nBeginner Tips - 1.Once you start gaining experience, don't rush the game and skip encounters. Doing so will leave you much weaker once you near the end of the story, and you will really just be making the game uncomfortably difficult for yourself. 2.Best defense is a good offense here most of the time. 3.Paradigm shift. A lot. 4.Grab ATB and accessory upgrades from the role trees asap.\n\nOther opinions - As far as hearsay regarding this game in comparison to FFXIII-2 and FFXIII-3: The second and third games seemed little more than truly terrible fan fiction to me, and featured some awful game mechanic and interface changes/additions. I simply can't understand why anyone would claim that they were an improvement over this game in any way whatsoever. Unfortunately, I found that the only way to preserve the memory of the wonderful characters I came to know and love in this game was to pretend that the second and third games do not even exist. Story and mechanics aside, they are absolutely abysmal ports, with the first game being BY FAR the best optimized port of the three. FFXIII is the masterpiece, people.\n\nClosing - If you've taken the time to read this entire review, I hope you've gained a better understanding of what to expect from this game, and wish you a very enjoyable experience.","May 30","true","188.3"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","12","12","0","0"

Connected by more hallways. Aside from this point, I don't think that's where the games interesting aspects lie. Hear me out.\n\nMechanics :\nThe battle system is extremely chaotic at first glance. It's essentially an anime meter management sim. However it sure feels good when you manage those meters well. The battle system is almost completely automated, you have 6 characters and 6 roles they could play. (I'll get into why that doesn't really matter until you're at least 27+ hours in, later)\n\nQuick summation of each role\nCommando – Builds chains, physical attacks\nRavager – aids in chain building, stagger meter drains faster than COM, uses magic\nSentinel – the consummate tank, aggro machine\nSynergist – Provides + stat buffs\nSaboteur – not intuitively named, gives target – stat debuffs\nMedic – support healer, self explanatory\n\nYou take either two or three of these roles depending on where you are at in the narrative. And form Paradigms or strategies (up to six) Essentially you control the leader of the pack while the other party members fulfill their role they have been assigned in the current paradigm. Effectively you as the leader switch paradigms to best fit the situation at hand. With most battles objective to get the enemy stagger meter all the way up, allowing their turns to be interrupted and take more damage. All battles essentially go on like this for the duration of the game. (Building chains essentially is the stagger meter, as if the meter drops to zero you must restart “the chain” to get the enemy staggered once again)\n\nThere are a few exceptions such as the gestalt Eidolon battles. Which have you perform the same sorts of tactics under a timer. THE DOOM TIMER. Spooky. You end the battle by getting the gestalt meter to the top and pushing a button. A sort of manifestation of consciousness as I understand. Which leads me to the other part of battles which is known as TP or technical points. You can summon your Eidolon or do other moves unlocked through the various roles. Which in my experience were only useful in the end game. The Summons however where almost completely useless. A sort of fan service if I may borrow the term.\n\nThe game does open up. Despite its exceedingly boring linearity. In Chapter 9, you gain the ability to select your party and assign them any role. However it seems slightly counter productive to have your characters spec down a completely different path then what you've been doing for the past 20+ hours. In Chapter 11, the infamous open world comes to fruition. Sort of. You're no longer traversing an extremely linear actual hallway. You now have open fields to explore. You do have the option to take side missions but they are just crystal waypoints. There is some loose narrative in that you are fulfilling the focus of a l'cie turned Cei'th but what it really feels like is monster hunting to disguise level grinding. All that being said, they are not all easy fights. I had to adopt new strategies rather quickly to survive.\n\nThe game is fact rather easy until you are suddenly dropped into the wild fields of chapter 11 leading you into ten's possibly triple digits (if you're a completionist) of additional hours of fighting enemy after enemy. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not against level grinding but the degree to which this game makes you do it combined with not letting you choose who or how they will play until this far into it. Well, for lack of a better word. It's just wrong. And its not worth it.\n\nIt's just missing that special something. There isn't any HUB world. No replenishing stock with your favorite vendor and establishing a rapport after a long grind of killing beasts in the forests. Just inanimate kiosks that bring you goods should you ever need to actually purchase something. And that's another issue. Other-worldly precious Gil is almost a total non factor. Complete let down.\n\nThe story is fine. It's nothing to write home about. Lightning is a cool character. I like her better than Liara T'Soni (same voice actor) Although some obvious things drag on a little long Hope realizing he needs to forgive Snow and the weird reaction Snow has to Hope confronting him\n\nAll in all, the battle system is wasted on a game that is too linear and too long for its own good. This is a missed opportunity.","February 28, 2015","false","46.5"," 51 of 84 people (61%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","61","51","84","4","3"

Especially for me as it is my first ever Final Fantasy game. At the first part, it’s all fun and games. Most of the time, you just have to click the auto-battle and eventually, enemies will die. As I progress through, it really gets harder and harder. I had to bring out tons of different guides from the internet on how to upgrade efficiently, I had to search the internet for the best combinations and which weapon fits each character perfectly. In the last chapter, I ended up turning down the difficulty from normal mode to easy mode because enemies just became a pain in the ♥♥♥.\n\nThe good part is definitely not at the start, which is probably the reason a person will just stop playing. You can clearly see this from the average playtime of the users over here[steamspy.com].\n\nPros\nGame Length – One of the things you can expect from any Final Fantasy game is how long it takes to finish the story alone. For whatever price you got this game, you will surely get your money’s worth.\nCharacters – I think they are all amazingly done; they will definitely grow on you. They should… Given how long this game is.\nSkill system – Upon reaching a certain chapter, all characters can build up any class types. But ofcourse, different characters excel at different classes.\nCutscenes – This is already given, you can always expect that Square Enix will leave you in awe.\nNeutral\nPlot – I believe that there is not a single game on the franchise wherein the storyline is bad. I think it all comes down to which one is better. XIII may not be ranked as the top ones, but it is still great.\nBattle System – It’s a kind of battle system that you either love it or hate it. The game uses Command Synergy Battle, you can learn more about that in this site[finalfantasy.wikia.com]. Basically, you only control 1 character while the other two will fight automatically. And an ATB gauge which is utilized for your commands.\nRegion Locking – Apparently, if you live in Asia or atleast bought this game from Asia, you are bound to only have Japanese audio and English/Chinese/English subtitles. I understand that Japanese audio is the original, and nothing beats the original. But it wouldn’t hurt to have an option, right? Meanwhile those who don’t live in Asia will have both English and Japanese audio. The only downside of this, is that you will be downloading around 26gb more than those who live in Asia. Cons\nBad Optimization – It’s like they forgot that they are porting this game to PC. The game has very limited graphic options, four options to be exact: Screen Settings (Full-Screen or Windowed), Resolution, Shadow Resolution and Anti-aliasing (MSAA). Top those with a 30 FPS lock in-game and a 60 FPS lock on some cutscenes.\nVery Linear Gameplay – It says linear as one of its genre in the store page, but I did not expect a tutorial for about 40 hours wherein three guys walk a corridor and eventually get a taste of some side quests.","March 13","true","63.1"," 23 of 33 people (70%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","70","23","33","3","0"

It has an interesting combat system and awesome cut scenes, with lots of character development.  Well worth the price.  If however you have previously played this game on the consoles I would not recommend this game.  After all it is the exact same game you have already played.  There are no graphical improvements, no added quests, items, weapons, etc..  With only a slight increase in framerate & achievements thrown into the mix.\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\nOriginal Review\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------.\n\nI definately recommend this game.  It may be linear, but the combat is fun and fairly complex.  The story is pretty good, Each of the characters in your party has their own history and motivation.  The cinematics and world are beautifully rendered.  This is my first time playing ffxiii but so far I am thoroughly enjoying the game.  As ports go, I jave played far worse.\n\nA lot of people hve been saying negative things about the game, honestly I don't agree with some of those comments:\n\n1. The game is a massive 60Gb (When I first pre-ordered the game it was actually 30GB, but it only had English audio which upset a lot of fans, who then made a huge issue about it, even going so far as to start a petition to get SE to add Japanese audio to the game, which they then did, doubling the size of the game, so is it really SE's fault for the massive size when all thet were doing was listening to the fans?)\n2. Game locked at 720p (There's already an unofficial patch that unlocks 1080p)\n3. The only difference between the pc version and the ps3 version was increased framerate (What did you expect the game is only $16)\n4. They say don't buy the game so that SE has to make better next time (Seeing as one of the reasons the released FFxiii on pc was to see if it will be viable to release future ff games on pc, this means if only a few people buy ffxiii we will most likely see very few ff games coming to pc, this would mean no ffxv on pc)\n\nSo far my game has run smoothly with no lag.\nMy pc specs:\nWindows 7 64 bit\nQuad core 2.6 Ghz\n4 GB Ram\nGeforce GT 430\n\nSo if you want a fun fantasy jrpg for only $16 and you want to increase the chance of more final fantasy games coming to pc buy this game.","October 12, 2014","true","47.8"," 118 of 207 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","118","207","0","9"

Now that I finally have, I can talk about it somewhat fairly. The truth is that there's so much wrong with this game that it's hard to recommend it to just anyone.\n\nI enjoyed the combat system. The faster paced paradigm shift system (similar FFX-2's ATB/dressphere system) was a refreshing take on the turn based combat that FF12's didn't really provide. Shift canceling/ATB canceling also provided a lot more depth into what may look like simple combat mechanics. The story was acceptable but had major pacing issues with the first 10 chapters feeling overextended, while the last 3 chapters were much more enjoyable and interesting, yet shorter. What really stands out in the game however, are the visuals. Everything from the prologue to the end is a gorgeous vista of sci-fi fantasy, with a decadent high-tech society clashing against a beautiful yet raw planetscape. Eden in particular stood out for me, with it's beautiful architecture and sci fi-esque atmosphere.\n\nHowever, the infamous graphical issues, the random crashes that occur and the ESC key essentially being a one button Alt+F4 are major issues in this game. It's depressing to see a fan-made fix that was made in one day is still the only option to fix this heavily broken game. Squenix recently patched, and I was hoping for some official fixes, but all we got was a simple pop-up change to ask if you really wanted to quit the game when you hit ESC. Not even an ingame message but for me it distorts the current game screen and freezes it. Only by Alt-Tabbing do I see an off screen dialog window box asking me whether I really want to exit the game. I knew Japanese pc ports had a terrible history, but this one is almost as bad as the Dark Souls port (at least we didn't need GFWL). Technical issues aside, the pacing is terrible, you don't actually get to use the full combat system for the first half of the game. Sidequests are replaced by what is essentially hunts from FF12, the Crystarium system of leveling is extremely shallow with the bare minimum of choice. Animations are often clunky and slow for the kind of fast paced combat the game uses. These are some of the most obvious probelms you'll encounter.\n\nOverall, it isn't a terrible game. However, it's got so much wrong with it'll be hard to finish or enjoy, even for the seasoned RPG fanatic. It's a definite oddity in the consistency we've seen in the FF series. While it did have some very good areas, it's crippled of it's potential. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone unless they had the tenacity to see it through, and even then they might regret it.\n\n","November 11, 2014","false","97.6"," 84 of 146 people (58%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","58","84","146","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/mechanicallions/recommended/292120/","mechanicallions","Mechanical Lions","http://steamcommunity.com/id/mechanicallions/","552 products in account","Until now I've never quit playing a Final Fantasy game in the entire franchise's history. I don't even hold the earlier series in nostalgic sacredness like so many. FF7 was not my favorite. I loved 3(6) as much as the core fans, but I loved 5 and even 12 especially. Wasn't a huge fan of 10, but 10-2 was a blast. I played 11 online for well over a year on my PS2 and even though it wasn't a "real' FF game made no difference to me. It something different yet familiar and I enjoyed it in it's time. Point is I've experienced the series and have my own personal expectations when it comes to ups and downs. Being "new" doesn't sway me from critiquing a game so hard. I'm not mad because this game wasn't 7.5 or 6 HD.  I'm mad because this game was the first FF game I've refused to finish due to sheer stupidity on the games behalf. I've heard it was bad, but really assumed people were just not accepting a few things and that I'd find some kind of joy in playing it. Sadly, I owe all of these people an apology.\n\nThe game had some amazing ideas but it played out through the most time consuming nonsensical game flow I've ever seen. Final Fantasy games are usually top quality JRPG games, but this felt like something some B-label released on the  Vita as a niche experiment for marketing. Someone made a video game that 'They" wanted to play but they forgot about other people, and that's more than fantastic in the terms of selfish design. You should create experiences that mirror your own wants and needs, but you don't ruin a successful franchise to do it. The combat was actually a GOOD idea. Shifting into jobs and allowing other abilities to be used on the fly was forward thinking , but it's actually backwards in design. Monsters that have 89 million health so that you will consider the stagger meter at all times sounds tactical, but it's actually in-line with the rest of the game's thinking when it comes to cramming you down a corridor and forcing you to play a very specific way. Most of the fights boiled down to "create a few sets and find the right rotation" and once you did. It just became this treadmill of working your way through the same enemies over and over to get to the next key event.\n\n"But that's Final Fantasy!".\n\nActually you'd be correct, but it's not as fun when you aren't dynamically creating CHARACTERS you feel confident in. You are more or less just leveling jobs. Since the system is based on time = reward and the mobs have so much health,  you eventually get to the point where you don't want to fight a group of mobs forever so you begin to forsake the tanky roles and get more risky with damage and the debuffer types. Hey so the system works right? No. I don't design a character I enjoy. I design a placeholder full of jobs that I leveled up to compliment other placeholder jobs. Then I put someone else in my party and I have to rearrange all of those sets again.  The fact that characters are kinda like Transformers in their abilities is cool, but to be honest it's just dumb to constantly rotate someone to cast Faith or Protect. You didn't stop a character from having the ability to be able to use a lot of skills from other jobs. You just put this weird gated system in that made it a puzzle game to get to the the spell you need. The game would have been 892949% better had I just picked which spells to give someone and limited the usage of them much like the older games, but ALSO a step towards something new and different reflected. You tried to reinvent the wheel here, but you put square wheels on an otherwise drivable car.\n\nCombined with the grindy "level up equipment" that's introduced some 15 hours into the game, and it's also nearly impossible make use of until AFTER the game opens up, Characters are only reflected in the cutscenes. Their abilities should actually define them. In the past we've had super memorable characters like Terra and Vivi that were a product of their abilties. Not placed on the screen as a mindless attitude between coming up with stupid combos of things for them to do whilst you fight on to the next cutscene. The game's image is saying Lightining is basically a Commando that runs around shoving her sword up everything's butt. In the actual GAME though she's great at casting spells and healing people, which is quite a contradiction to shoving a sword up someone's butt. Not to mention training her in said jobs was a pointlessly gated system of absolutely no-choice whatsoever. Hold the button, level the things up on this pretty screen. Beat a boss? You can do it some more!\n\nThat said I hated this game. I really wanted to finish the story and give XIII-2 a chance since I already own it. I took a blind guess at how this game would end and a leap of faith into the interwebs. Wikipedia told me I was absoultely right in guessing the outcome because it's pretty to assume that every single established cliche would come into fruition (spoiler alert: it does!), so no I don't need to play this garbage for 30 more hours to feel satisfied nor justify my opinion that this is without a doubt one of the worst JRPG games I've ever played in the history of video games. It pains me to say that. This is a person that has done speedrun after speedrun of Final Fantasy 1 on the NES and tried crazy things like all White Mage parties. It's sad that the 1980's gave this level of flexibility and fun factor when it came to interacting with the game's mechanics and character choice. There is none of that here.  Pretty cutscenes cannot outweigh terrible game mechanics.\n\nFinal verdict:\n\n3/10.\n\nThis game is a corridor of linear failure that will annoy you if you expect to play an actual video game that tests something... anything... other than patience towards tedium and monotony. And this comes from a person that loves grindy JRPGS. (for Lolth's sake I played Marvel Heroes for almost 400 hours and that game is terribly grindy and admittingly boring! I couldn't stand to even finish this one)","April 12, 2015","false","23.5"," 88 of 154 people (57%) found this review helpful 10 people found this review funny","57","88","154","10","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedarkchaplain/recommended/292120/","thedarkchaplain","DarkChaplain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/thedarkchaplain/","2659 products in account","The PC Port is atrocious as of now. Not only did they not bother making localization files optional downloads (Steam supports selective downloading of localization files), and have you thus install 60 gigabytes (49gb download) onto your machine, but they also failed to provide any sort of graphical options beyond Windowed/Fullscreen modes. No VSync, no Anti-Aliasing. Additionally, the game's internal renderer is locked to 720p, and the game won't output anything but 720p. Fullscreen on an 1080p screen will thus either stretch/scale accordingly, or add black bars.\nThey have also failed to add audio options. There are no volume sliders at all.\n\nOn the Gameplay front, there's enough been said already. The game is excruciatingly linear, and chock-full of cutscenes. For comparison: If you played Final Fantasy X and considered it too linear due to the lack of global world map and directly connected areas, you'll hate XIII. It takes a good 15-20 hours of corridor walking to reach the point where it opens up a little bit. There is little to nothing to distract you from narrow corridors.\n\nThe combat system is shoving the Auto-Battle command down your throat right from the start. The command selects attacks and abilities based on dynamically calculated algorithms. Especially early on, where the characters are limited to one job, with one or two commands(!), the game turns into a simple "Press A to do stuff" simulator. The tactical element from previous Final Fantasy titles is almost completely lost as a result, as the game almost turns the player into a passive observer.\n\nOn top of this, the game attempts to "rate" the player's combat performance from 1 to 5 stars, based on how long it took them to win a battle. The rating affects the item drops, but even then a 5 star rating will not guarantee even common drops. I'd also like to point out that the target time, especially early on, is very generous, almost giving double the time you actually need to finish a battle with a 5 star rating.\n\nLastly, battles are completely isolated from one another. Where in previous FF titles you had to watch your HP carefully, and would take damage and negative status effects into the following battles, XIII instead heals the party to full health after a win. Wave-based engagements like seen in Final Fantasy X (most notably the tutorial section teaching you to pick targets wisely, or the Bevelle Marriage scene) do not stress you beyond the current, very short battle.\n\nAs for the story I will just say it is very, very convoluted and throws technobabble at the player for lack of better writing. The characters contradict each other and themselves at every turn, and make you shake your head in disbelief. At least the Japanese Audio will make their voices bearable, though.\nBe prepared to read up on a lot of the game's terminology and background via the in-game Datalog to fully grasp the game's reasoning. Still, do not expect things to make complete sense.\n\nGraphically, it still looks quite nice, with pretty effects being thrown around. The vast amount of pre-rendered cutscenes (18, if I count the game's video files) look gorgeous, even if the contents aren't making for a good story. If you enjoy eyecandy, you will get it, even though the resolution lock and lack of options are a big failure on Square Enix's part.\n\nOverall, the pricetag reflects the game's quality. The mechanics and exploration are half-baked and too automated and controlled to satisfy an old franchise fan like me. The port is dreadful, and I would not recommend buying it until they at least offer a patch to add some basic settings for graphics and audio.\n\nIf you can't wait, though, please don't expect it to be up there with the franchise's gems and fan-favorites. It "innovated" on all the wrong areas, and neglected its core vision as well as the franchise's strongest point: Storytelling and Character Development. As such, XIII is a lukewarm JRPG at best, and a below-average corridor crawler at worst.","October 9, 2014","false","53.4"," 166 of 298 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","166","298","0","2"

And that should be what matters, sure the game doesn't have 1080p atm so what? you don't think modders are working with this now? at least they didn't forget about 60FPS. Yes the game is locked at 720p is that bad? kinda but does that give this game a thumb down? no, do the game got graphic options? no not in-game but you can force things like AF and AA through Nvidia control panel or the equelant for AMD. So about the actual game? is it good? yes it's very good actually as good as the PS3 release. Why? because it's the same game. Are the controlls any good? yes they are actually very good i have tried this game with both gamepad and mouse and keyboard and you know what? the controlls are amazing. Final Fantasy XIII isn't just a game you merely enjoy. You fall in love with it. It's gorgeous worlds have you stopping to admire them in complete awe, while a graceful soundtrack massages your brain. Final Fantasy XIII is an amazing game. With an engrossing story and a thrilling new battle system, this is one title you can't afford to miss as an RPG fan. However, though it succeeds on the most important fronts, there are some notable areas where the game could have been better. The linear level design is a fairly large stumbling block, and if you are used to open-world games, it can make the entire experience feel a little claustrophobic.\n\ni give the game 8/10 it's a very great game, it's not perfect but very close.","October 9, 2014","true","36.0"," 186 of 335 people (56%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","56","186","335","3","37"

Even the leveling up system feels like it was pared down: it's like FFX's Sphere Grid, but lacking any kind of significant branching. I'm about 14 hours in, and the game is still feeding me a steady drip of new battle mechanics, each more tedious than the last; unfortunately, new mechanics don't make the game more fun or interesting, because battles are still essentially just blocks of time where you mash A for a while. I mean, sometimes the game throws you a single stronger enemy and you need to switch between preset battle styles, but in practice it feels more tedious than exciting or interesting. Battles aren't the only thing that's repetitive: the dialogue gets repeated and rephrased a lot too, so I frequently found myself watching two dimensional characters think out loud at each other over and over.\n\nOf the ~14 hours I've played, I think about half of it has been just watching cut scenes. Some of the sequences are so long there are (sometimes multiple) save points in the middle. Some of the sequences are so long that my Steam Link shuts off because it hasn't received any inputs in a long time.\n\nI want to like this game, and I feel like if I kept at it, by the time I got to the end the battles could be legitimately interesting. But I also feel like it'll still be dripping me new ideas right up to the final boss. I've kind of been playing this in the hopes that at some point, they say, "OK, tutorial over!" but, again, I'm at 14 hours and so far the game has only treated me like a ♥♥♥♥♥ and I'm just kind of tired of doing the same ♥♥♥♥ over and over to advance characters that I can't force myself to pay attention to.","February 3","false","13.9"," 78 of 140 people (56%) found this review helpful 12 people found this review funny","56","78","140","12","6"

It cuts a few of the archetypal role-playing elements, while adding little to make up for it.  It's linear, you're gonna be dealing with pre-made parties, tutorials, and little customization for about %70 of the main game.  Regardless of all that, I really enjoyed Final Fantasy XIII.  The combat is simple, yet fun and rewarding.  The game looks great, and the music and SFX are top notch, and even though the story and cast are a bit mediocre, it's still very much worth a play.\n\nNow, the big elephant in the room...\nBeing locked at 720p isn't what most of us were hoping for, even if they did allow for 60fps.

Honestly, it’s not. Not as bad as everyone says anyway.\n\nAs far as story goes, it’s pretty much the same old Final Fantasy formula. A group of unsuspecting heroes must travel to the farthest reaches of the world in order to destroy an ancient evil which hangs the very fate of the world in the balance. However, FINAL FANTASY XIII (referred to as FF XIII from now on) has probably one of the most convoluted narratives I have ever come across, which needed three games in order to straighten out (and even then they didn’t do all that great a job.) FF XIII is an epic adventure, and is successful in managing to make its self interesting and is sure to hook your attention for the 40-50 hours you will be spending there. However, the game does take a while to get off. Things start to get interesting around hours 10-20, where the pacing begins to move the game more steadily. The story is told from the perspectives of our new playable heroes; Lighting, Snow, Hope, Sazh, Fang and Vanille. These characters have been subject to a lot of criticism, which is understandable because most of them are extremely unlikable and far too whacky for their own good. They fit well in to the story however, and that’s probably the only thing that makes them bearable.\nThe gameplay is probably one of the better aspects of the game, as the new Paradigm System is a huge improvement on previous Final Fantasy battle systems. It allows complete customisation of the battle field and characters, as the new level-up system allows you to level up certain aspects of your characters.\n\nAs far as a Final Fantasy game goes, this really does break the chain and dares to be different. As the first FF game to grace the 7th console generation, it tried to be something new and I think it succeeded in doing so. It is a very enjoyable game, despite its many flaws – and is easily the best game in the FINAL FANTASY XIII trilogy. It’s whacky, it’s new and it’s different. But sadly, I think it can only be enjoyed fully by a fan of the series. If you are looking to join the Final Fantasy universe, do not start with this one. Try out FINAL FANTASY VII, and see how you feel from there.\n\nAll in all, FINAL FANTASY XIII does not deserve the criticism it gets. It’s not the best Final Fantasy, nor is it the worst.\n\nIf you decide to give this game a bash, then you DON’T need to play FINAL FANTASY XIII-2 and Lighting Returns to get the full story. They essentially tarnish the narrative in FF XIII, so only get in to the trilogy if you are ready for a commitment.\n\n+ Great battle system, one of the best that the series has to offer\n+ Story is told in an interesting way. Characters interact well with each other and the narrative\n+ Level up system\n- Convoluted narrative. Made worse by unnecessary sequels\n- Poor pacing. Game takes  a while to kick off\n- Bad port\n- Over powered bosses. What else did you expect? It’s Final Fantasy\n8/10","October 10, 2014","true","15.2"," 35 of 60 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","35","60","0","0"

It is the thirteenth major installment in the Final Fantasy series. The game includes fast-paced combat, a new system for the series for determining which abilities are developed for the characters called "Crystarium", and a customizable "Paradigm" system to control which abilities are used by the characters. Final Fantasy XIII includes elements from the previous games in the series, such as summoned monsters, chocobos, and airships.\n\nThe game takes place in the fictional floating world of Cocoon, whose government, the Sanctum, is ordering a purge of civilians who have supposedly come into contact with Pulse, the much-feared world below. The former soldier Lightning begins her fight against the government in order to save her sister who has been branded as an unwilling servant to a god-like being from Pulse, making her an enemy of Cocoon. Lightning is soon joined by a band of allies, and together the group also become marked by the same Pulse creature. They rally against the Sanctum while trying to discover their assigned task and whether they can avoid being turned into monsters or crystals at the completion.\n\nOne of the best JRPG on PC. This game is perfect. The story is awesome. Just in the beggining I didn't understand what the hell is going on here. But by the time playing Final Fantasy XIII you will get it or at least you will have an idea. The characters are cool and interesting. The graphics are beautiful. Girls are very sexy in this game (Fang really enjoys watching at other girls). The music is very sweet. Most of the tracks are very calm. The atmosphere this game creates is just fantastic. The controls are pretty good.\n\nTo sum up I can say that I'm deeply in LOVE with Final Fantasy XIII and I really enjoyed time spending on this game. I hope that other Final Fantasy games are as good as this one.","June 25, 2015","true","98.0"," 29 of 49 people (59%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","59","29","49","4","0"

Locked at 1280x720 resolution, no graphics settings, absolutely gigantic download (60 GB + 120 GB required for install), and badly optimized so framerate jumps all over the place and stutters a lot. The FMV cutscenes and audio are also supposedly lower quality than the PS3 version.\n\nI know it's not right to judge the game entirely technically, but since this is a port of an old game released YEARS AGO and the only selling point was for people to play it on PC with enhanced graphics and all, well...it does not deliver that at all. You might as well play the console version for a better experience.\n\nThank god there's at least a way to mod higher resolutions in, but really, Square should've fixed that themselves. It's outrageous to release any kind of PC game without offering any graphics options whatsoever and it just shows that they paid no attention whatsoever into this port. Even the instant esc-button closing the game feels super cheap like this was a test build and they couldn't be bothered to create a proper menu for it.\n\nI'm all for more games being ported to PC but this minimum effort kind of release is not the right way to do it at all. I can't support it. I'm only playing it because I missed the PS3 release which I might as well have played instead.","October 10, 2014","false","18.0"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","3"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Orion1189/recommended/292120/","Orion1189","Orion1189","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Orion1189/","600 products in account","THE GAME:\nWhat I once regarded as my least favorite Final Fantasy game by far, and one of my least favorite games ever, has somehow grown on me quite a bit given a lot more time. To get the negatives out of the way, the bulk of the game, especially the critical path, is extremely linear, sometimes even resembling series of interconnected hallways with battles scattered along the way. That said, there is a very rewarding wealth of late-game content awaiting those who can persevere. A huge number of optional side quests and expansive, wide-open areas, in stark contrast to the former half to two thirds of the game. However, as I found out, it is very much worth the wait.\n\nAnd the real core of the experience, and what drove me to keep going to the end (and then some), is the excellent combat system. The battle system is fairly unconventional for a FF game, while still drawing a lot of inspiration from the previous entries, giving a sense of familiarity to series fans, while also making it feel very fresh and different. This difference is something that you may love or hate. Yes, there is a lot of "mash A to win" in the combat here, but once the game finally allows you to experience all of what the combat system has to offer, you'll understand that the addition of an "auto battle" menu option in battle doesn't actually dumb down or simplify the tried and true Final Fantasy combat, but instead shifts the tactical focus to clever use of the "paradigm shift" mechanic at the right times to dole out the damage, buff/debuff, heal, etc. What this ultimately means is FFXIII offers as much tactical potential in its combat as the previous games in the series, while making it feel much faster-paced and intense. It is extremely unfortunate that the game forcibly holds your hand for nearly 10 hours before finally letting you really get an idea of what this combat can offer, and another 15-20 hours on top of that to really let you go nuts with it, but if you can stick it out, you will be rewarded greatly.\n\nVisually, the game is still incredible looking, regardless of the fact that it came out nearly 5 years ago. The music is excellent as well, almost across the board, as is usually the case with the Final Fantasy series. As for the story and characters, it's a mixed bag, and definitely something that will differ based on personal tastes. For me, I didn't find much substance in either. There are certainly some flashy moments here and there, but I mainly looked forward to getting back to combat any time a cutscene popped up.\n\nTHE PORT:\nNow, just like the game is a bit of a mixed bag, the same goes for this PC port. It's pretty obvious that there wasn't a ton of effert put into sprucing the game up for it's PC debut: a complete lack of graphical options, resolution that is locked to 1280x720, plenty of performance issues varying from user to user, and a MASSIVE download size weighing in at about 50 gigabytes. It's far from a polished release, for sure. That being said, it's also a relatively inexpensive release, at a regular $15 at the time of this writing, and for that price and the amount of time I've been able to put into it so far, I can look past the few crashes and occasional framerate hiccups (or chokes, at times), and be pretty happy with the purchase. And if they manage to patch the game up and improve performance, then all the better.\n\nTLDR:\nThe game has an amazing combat system hidden under a soso story and HOURS of linear, handholding gameplay, but the wait is well worth it. The PC port is also pretty iffy, but if you can look past the performance flaws, you'll have a good time with it for the price.","November 2, 2014","true","82.9"," 31 of 53 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","31","53","0","0"

The game looked gourgeous on the PS3 and I couldn't wait to see how good it would look on a PC, running at 60 FPS and at a 1080p resolution.\n\nThe day of release came and I anxiously booted it up, only to become frustrated. The first window the game opens before running has only two options: Windowed/Fullscreen selection and Audio Language selection. I figured the graphics options would be inside the game itself, so I got in and looked for them. I found nothing, because there are NO GRAPHICS CONFIGURATIONS in this game. You can't change the resolution to 1080p, it's locked to 720p. You can't turn Vsync on or off, and I think it's ON by default, causing very annoying slowdowns since the game isn't optimized at all.\n\nAfter a liittle more than an hour playing it, the game seems to be good, especially to me since I'm a Final Fantasy fan, but  Square Enix making the PC users play the game under these conditions is just disrespectful. My recommendation will stay at NO until they decide to correct their mistake.","October 9, 2014","false","92.2"," 104 of 192 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","104","192","0","0"

About the three issues listed above, there are the solutions:\n\n- Use GeDoSaTo\n- Use GeDoSaTo\n- Sorry, the game is really big, no solution for this one\n\nIf you want to know how good is the game, continue reading, if you just care about the problems, they're over, you can ignore the rest.\n\nFirst of all, the game is GORGEOUS! It is surrealistic like most titles of the series, the story is a little complicated, but well written. Most characters will captivate you, even the ones who lack a little depth(I'm looking at you, Snow). The plot twists are not monumental, but they will hold your interest. Everything looks done with attention to details. If you like to think about the characters and the events, you will like this game.\n\nThe game is VERY (I mean, like REALLY) linear. There is no open world to explore (exceptions in some chapters) and there is not much to do besides the main quest. I did not find this too bad, the main quest is good enough to make the game worth it.\n\nThe combat system brings something new to the series and, personally, I enjoyed that. It sometimes gives more action than Final Fantasy XII system. You cannot control your teamates actions, only the party leader's. The AI is relatively good (there is no much left for the AI to do, since you will select their role) and there is the paradigm shift mechanic, which allow you to change the roles of your team to adapt to different situations in battle. Those roles change a lot of things, from the damage you deal and receive to the actions/skills available and battle support. The stagger bar on enemies and characters brings a new aproach to damage dealing, sometimes is prefreable to do less damage in order to prepare a more efficient offensive.\n\nThe music and dialogs are nicely implemented, you can feel that the characters have life. The music ambientation and placing is perfect and will atract you even more to the game. The only thing I can blame in this section is the dialogs text. Although they're mostly interesting and full of emotion, some lines don't feel "natural", like "no one would say this"(I'm looking to you again, Snow!).\n\nOverall, I enjoyed the game a lot, I played it on Xbox and now I want to play it again on PC. I hope the sequels come to PC as well.\n\nRating: 9/10","October 10, 2014","true","1.5"," 30 of 52 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","30","52","0","0"

Replace every noun in FFXIII with Marklar and you would not be any more lost as to what is going on or why.  There is an entire encyclopedia that opens up as you play the game, but it only opens up when it feels like it.  I would figure having all the information ahead of time and studying said encyclopedia would allow the player a better understanding about the story from the start.  Then again, if I wanted to read a story about another world and people saving the day, I'd read a book, not play a game.\n\nI made it 16 hours in and I'm still on rails, following character stories that I am barely starting to understand about characters that I really don't care about.  You jump from one group to the next with no real reason and lacking context of their world or situation.  I found it very difficult to connect to them in any way.  At least beyond the ideas of, Snow is an idiot, Hope is a cry-baby, Lightning is a robot, Vanille makes the most annoying sounds, and Sazh is what you would expect of people trying to be PC about a character.  My favorite character so far, is the chocobo chick that lives in Sazh's hair.  That little guy is more expressive than any of the other characters, and that's just out of his 20 minutes of screen time.\n\nWhile times change, so do games and everything else.  Final Fatnasy XIII is less fantasy and more sci-fi.  Albeit 1970's, B-rated, acid trip sci-fi.  Horrible storytelling, un-relatable characters, constant tutorials, game mechanics that play the game for you, an unnecessarily convoluted leveling system(one that puts the sphere grid of FF-X to shame), and a world so lost in itself it requires a dictionary and encyclopedia to understand.  If you're new to the FF series, you might like it, especially if you are into sci-fi.  If you are one of the "old school" FF players, that loved anything 7 or under, you should skip it, the series is dead.\n\nOh, and motorcycle twins Shiva summons.

The music, story and characters are all expertly woven together throughout the story flawlessly. Whilst people would argue differently over the characters, they often fail to realise that a character you hate is just as good as a character you love in terms of, well, their CHARACTER. It is the reason we all wanted Geoffrey dead in Game of Thrones, because he was such a good CHARACTER.\n\nIf you have not played any Final Fantasy game before this is a fantastic game to begin with. The best, I would argue. Not that this is the games only redeeming factor, nor is it diminished by any of the other games. If you are someone who is looking to step into this series and see what all the commotion is about, then this is the game for you. Should you like it, continue on through to play the coming sequels to this Trilogy that will be released over the next year or so. Should you not, put the game down and walk away, you lose nothing but a few hours of your time, if that. You are only denying yourself the chance to experience what I think to be an absolutely outstanding game if you shape your decisions off of the vocal hatred witnessed often for this title.\n\nThis review is made for the people looking to test the water in our critically acclaimed Final Fantasy but are unsure of where to start. Do not look to this game and be discouraged by a vocal minority that spout various criticisms and compare it to their beloved Final Fantasy '#'. This game has a much larger fanbase that love the game than the ones who adamantly put it down at every turn.

So far this has absolutely nothing to do with any FF games I've played in the past - VI, VII, X and X-2, which I all liked in their own way. But this installment of the series here seems to be just a linear "press A to win" corridor runner. Though it still plays like a real long tutorial, if I don't make use of the "press A to win" mechanics (auto battle), the battles feel confusingly chaotic. And while there seems to be a certain (albeit small) promise to the story, the characters are extremely unlikeable and behave more than cringeworthy. Lightning is the best of the bunch, but even she is just a cardboard cutout.\n\nI fear I probably will stop loss and drop this even though I recently bought all three of them ...\n\nEdit: After yet another set of corridors and boring monsters, I decided to uninstall.

As last also keep in mind I am writing this review with only a few hours into the game. thanks in advance;\n\nFirst of all I am new to the Final Fantasy series. This summer sale (2015) I bought FF3, 4 and 13. I played 3 for like 7 hours by the time I am writing this and started 13 today.\n\n(Without spoilers)\n----------Story----------\n\nThe game introduces you with a cutscenes which are beautifully made by the way. My first reaction was "It looks epic". It tells about the usual good vs evil but with a twist. The story really submerges you into the FF world, the athmosphere, music, sound, everything helps with making you feel submerged.\nThe game has 6 main characters which all have their own story. FF does a great job on combining them so they all have their own and their shared story.\n\nThe cut scenes are a welcoming thing. I am actually excited when one appears. Normally I feel like skipping but with this game its like watching a movie.\n\n----------Combat----------\n\nThe combat is just like (from what I know) the other FF games: Turn based.\nOnly everything continues simultaneously, so in other words: If you dont tell your character which attacks to use the character will get attacked but wont attack unless you tell it too. You control one character per battle and the others in your party will auto-attack based on what attacking scheme you use.\n\nFighting schemes decide which classes what characters use.\nFor example you can have a scheme where you would have one Attacker, tank and a medic. If you would control the character who is the attacker the tank will try to take the hits and obviously the medic will try to heal.\n\nYou can switch schemes at any time in a battle and I recommend you do so.\nThe battle begins as you walk towards an enemy and they notice you, But you can also try to sneak up from behind to try and land a sneak attack. With a sneak attack the enemies stagger bar is already filled so when you hit an attack the enemy will be staggered and take extra damage.\n\nNow what is staggering? When you chain up attacks on a specific target their stagger bar will be filled and when it's full your next attack will stagger it so the enemy will take more damage and be stunned for the first hit.\n\nYou fight with a max of 3 people from what I have seen till now.\n\n----------Customization----------\n\nIs pretty basic, A skill tree based on the classes so for example: Char 1 -> Choose which of the classes you want to upgrade the skills of.-> Upgrade skill -> Earn more xp with battles ^\n\nI am pretty happy with the skill system, its basic but it works good. Feel comfortable and not weird.\nYou can customize what kind of weapons your characters have and what kind of boosters etc. By the time I am writing this it is not that important in the game yet.\n\nPros:\n->Looks good\n->Good story\n->Great atmosphere\n->Option between Japanese or English audio\n->Beautiful world\n->Great combat\n->Keyboard feels comfy to use too\n\nCons:\n->Not a lot of settings to choose from\n->Combat might feel repetitive for some\n\nBoth:\n->Lots of grinding\n\nTL:DR;\nI recommend this game, makes me feel part of the world, but lots of grinding.\n\n8.5/10","June 28, 2015","true","8.2"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","12","18","2","2"

I don't understand the hate towards this game, i understand that it has awful flaws. The cosntant tunnel runs being the main gripe, but gameplay wise is it bad? No! the combat system is actually interesting, the issue with it is that it isn't fully realized, they had an idea but they didn't fully execute a team wide combat system for some reason, but despite that its still a very fun and interesting combat system.\n\nAs for the story, it isn't as conveluted as most people might think, the main problem here is that the names of the "Deities" are largely similar to what the Human Drones and "Branded" humans are, but despite that the backstory is actually quite unqiue! I love the world buliding, the locations, the general universe and its all quite exciting if you think about it.\n\nThe main downfall storywise is the likability of the characters; Snow is overly passionate, Hope is all a bit too whiney at the beginning before gaining his Edulon, Vanille always seems like an awkward mix of Postitive and Depressed. but I feel like most of the issue here is fixed through the Japanese Voice Acting, because they deliver the lines much more genuinely than the English counterparts that go full ham and not enough ability to tone it down!\n\nBesides what I see as the worst game in the Franchise - Final Fantasy VIII - comparitively its so much better, but I still see hoards of people give VIII a glowing score beause ♥♥♥♥ing nostalgia!\n\nbut its not much different to Final Fantasy X as a game now is it? I mean they're similar yet they both are hold in different acclaim and I think there is a reason.\n\nEndless Corridors. Check. A plotline involving the destruction of a civilization through the transformation into said destructive force (Ragnarok and SIN). Check.  Character with a Shadey past and Moody demeanor (Lightning/Auron). Check. Token happy Ethnic guy with troubled past (Sazh/Wakka). Check. Scared healer needing the support of everyone who finds their feet (Yuna/Hope). Check.\n\nIts scary how similar the two games and I think thats partially the reason.\n\nbut I feel like the main hate of this game is beacuse Square are realizing Final Fantasy is the same game year after year, and they've wanted to change that since XII/Kingdom Hearts.\n\nSo this was the first step in an entirely new direction. They want to keep the old souls happy, so they made Bravely Default, but they've come to realise that Final Fantasy can't be the same game anymore, they want it to be more of a cinematic experience.\n\nFinal Fantasy XV looks like the prime example of that.\n\nedit: The PC version suffered from awful porting with no graphics options.\n\nThey somehow vamped up the graphics so much that when it turned it on after the update I literally ♥♥♥♥ myself after seeing the difference.\n\nit looks so. much. ♥♥♥♥ing. better. than. the. console. counterparts.\n\nLiterally 8/10 right now.\n\nSquare enix are seeing the PC market as a serious money maker and they seem to care right now.\n\nthis is only a good thing","October 20, 2014","true","84.9"," 43 of 77 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","43","77","0","3"

My score is tethering just on the edge between Recommended and Not Recommended.  But thanks to the production values I can’t deny I had a reasonably good time with the game. Nobody was phoning it in during the production of this game. The problem is, every design decision in the game from the combat system, exploration and level design were shaped around the story. They’re all there to support it. Unfortunately it’s no exaggeration to call the story a complete mess.\n\nIt takes about 20 hours before you can answer the simple question: “What is this game about?”. It’s not like nothing happens before that point, but it has a laser focus on the characters, without explaining anything about the world it takes place in or what’s going on. This section of the game was the best, even though it was confusing. It did at least contain drama. It had glimmers of brilliance here, like a character driven to suicidal despair in a way which felt believable. In scene after scene it tried to be touching, and felt earnest. I liked that.\n\nIn the second half of the game this all fades away. Focus is shifted from the character to the “plot”. Things start to happen, it’s going somewhere. But all the characters freeze in development. Everyone in the cast had multiple layers of issues in the first half. They were all maintaining a facade, with deep regrets over how their lives had turned out. Things which in a good story would be dealt with in a satisfactory way before the end. Instead they’re all dropped. Other things take center stage, and the story starts to feel hollow. I remember the writers of Stargate SG-1 referred to certain episodes as “plot driven” or “character driven”. The plot driven episodes were always boring pieces of crap. This is how the second half of Final Fantasy XIII feels. Things happen on screen, but it's so vapid I start to question what I'm doing with my life. Not the kind of experience I'm looking for in a game.\n\nThe shoe really drops at what was clearly intended to be the emotional low point at the end of the second act. The place you visit, the meaning it should have for the characters just doesn’t exist in the script. The environment, the enemies, and the music do their best to create a feeling of loss. The writing here is simply a disaster. It doesn’t acknowledge the scene before you. Characters are as cheerful as ever, when they should be screaming at the sky. It should have been the scene the game had been building up to the entire game. The payoff for everything that had gone before. Instead there’s nothing. Just the vague intent of what they were aiming for based on the work everyone else on the team put in for the environment.\n\nPlaying it I got the impression everyone involved believed they were making the best Final Fantasy ever. The designs, the music, the level of technical expertize are on the highest possible level. It’s a game where it feels like the negative response came as a genuine surprise to the developers. On paper, every element they’ve included in the game are the ingredients of a classic. Did they realize the wreck they were making?\n\nThe game deserved better than this. It’s possible they noticed the problems midway through production. But when you notice too late, there’s nothing you can do. You have to do it right from the start. Changing course is incredibly expensive, both in time and money. Whoever was responsible for saying that the script was “good enough” did it too soon. A single critical component ruined the entire game. I pray they don’t make the same mistake with Final Fantasy XV.","January 6, 2015","true","44.0"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","12","18","2","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/recommended/292120/","Humanure","Belphegore","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Humanure/","1599 products in account","Final Fantasy XIII was originally released in 2009, it rose quickly as one of the modern favorites of the franchise's fan base. Opposed to its predecessors, the title is quite different in terms of gameplay and style; which is a make or break point for many who've played it. Final Fantasy XIII is either a game that you're going to fall in love with, or absolutely despise.\n\nThe storyline is straightforward and simple; set in a futuristic world called Cocoon, it is up to ex-soldier Lightning and her five comrades to decide and unleash the fate of the world all the while attempting to figure out the focus that they've been cursed with. The landscapes and levels are beautifully designed, both equally colorful and filled with rich organic and bio-mechanical life.  As always with Square Enix, the pre-rendered cutscenes were ahead of their time when the game first released, and they've aged fantastically over the last seven years. No one can deny that the game looks superb, sleek and stylish. Though beware, 98% of the game is made up of linear corridors, while only one small section in Chapter 11 (out of 13) has a small open exploration area.\n\nThough as gamers know, looks are definitely not everything. Final Fantasy XIII can hardly be classified as an RPG, rather it would be better classified as an action game, and many of the franchises main elements have been left behind in lieu of moving forward and carving a new path; unfortunately, main staples that we've grown to love over the decades are nowhere to be found within this installment. There is no leveling system, your characters level up by obtaining Crystogen points which are then spent in the Crystarium; much akin to the skill system in Final Fantasy X. Crystogen points can be spent between a total of six Paradigms (classes); Medic, Commando, Ravager, Synergist, Sentinel and Saboteur.\n\nAt times, the battle system seems both overly complex and at the same time overly simple. The game makes the battle system come across as complex, as it throws new tutorials at you for the first 8-9 hours, you're really better off piecing it together on your own to avoid becoming overwhelmed. Despite having three characters in your part at (almost) all times, you only have control over whoever you've deemed as the leader... once you get to that point. You don't actually get to pick your party members until well over halfway into the game. This can be rather frustrating when the AI doesn't do its job, and sticks you with picking up the slack with one character. Although it is fun to fight alongside Eidolons, the summons in this title, it can also be frustrating when they fail to keep an enemy Staggered.\n\nWeapons can also be upgraded/leveled by using found and/or bought components, typically most weapons can be upgraded three tiers to their ultimate form. All of these weapons can be purchased from the store, and are not missable; unlike in previous titles where you would have to seek out a character's ultimate item. There's also no armor, the best that you'll get are accessories. The higher you rank up your Paradigms, the more chance you have to unlock another accessory slot. Accessories can also be upgraded in the same manner as weapons, though typically only one or two tiers are available.\n\nThe biggest issue with Final Fantasy XIII is that this port is terrible, the performance in terms of FPS is utter garbage. My above average rig (specs in profile) cannot get this title to run at a smooth, stable 60 FPS. While I did achieve this during some sections of the game, the FPS would hop all over the place; from being locked at 30, to back up to 60, to running generally in between 40-50, while occasionally dipping down to 20-25. It didn't seem to matter where I was in game, what I was doing, and oddly enough the open world area in Chapter 11 was the place where I got mostly consistent 60 FPS. The only part of this game that runs at a constant 60 FPS are the pre-rendered cutscenes. However, this port is nowhere near as flawed as Final Fantasy XIII-2. There are some minor fixes in the Community Hub, but few work.\n\nWhile I hated every aspect of the gameplay with Final Fantasy XIII, I loved every moment of the story; this seems to be a general consensus for those who are more attracted to older Final Fantasy titles. There are a lot of moving moments during the story, and the characters have a great depth to them that hasn't been seen since Final Fantasy X. The player will find themselves growing attached with empathy to the entire gang. A huge part of the playtime within this title is committed to cutscenes and story building. In fact, I would say out of the 30 hours that it took me to finish this game that 10 of those hours were dedicated to cutscenes. So if you're in the mood for a good story, Final Fantasy XIII definitely has your back. However, given the performance issues, it is hard for me to recommend this title. I would wait for at least a 50% off sale, otherwise just get it on another platform to avoid having your experience tainted.\n\nRating: 3.5/5.0 - Average, can take it or leave it.Belphegore's Hell House Reviews (Group)","March 9","true","79.3"," 11 of 17 people (65%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","65","11","17","0","6"

What does it fix? We now get a confirmation that we want to close the game when we press escape in full screen.\n\nExcuse me if I'm too overwhelmed to edit anything else about my review just yet. (Less cynically: at least it's SOMETHING and the patch notes say they're working on other stuff. I'll be holding my breath until I pass out from lack of oxygen. Stay tuned, and, as always... Please look forward to it.)\n\nOriginal review:\n\nLocked 720p resolution\nESC key is a shortcut for Alt+F4 in full screen mode\nLiterally no graphics configuration options (whoops, I mean, you can choose full screen or windowed)\nBest 60 GB I ever spent 10/10 would fellate Squeenix again\n\n::10/10/2014 EDIT::\n\n60 GB is stupid. The "reason" this game is 60 GB supposedly is because fans clamored for Japanese languages. To maintain everyone's super deep lip sync immersion, this means that the Japenese language pack doesn't just consist of extra audio files, but slightly tweaked versions of every pre-rendered cutscene. So the game installs two versions of every cutscene on your computer. And no, the Japanese pack is not optional. Why not do as Dynasty Warriors 8 did and make the Japanese language pack free optional DLC? I'm not the only one who isn't going to play with Japanese voices (though I know many are). Perhaps they could even offer two separate downloads, a 30GB English install and a 30GB Japanese install. (I don't see the need for having both installed at the same time, since I figure most people would play through the game using one or the other language.)\n\nLocked 720p is stupid. Note that this isn't CAPPED 720p, it's LOCKED 720p. There are literally no resoultion options. The game touts 60 FPS but many people experience stuttering and inconsistent framerames (myself included). Some people have suggested certain workarounds revolving configuring video drivers, with mixed results. Some say it works, some report it doesn't. (I'm in the "it doesn't do anything" boat.) And before the mindless white knighting fanboys tell me to upgrade my toaster hurr durr (in the same breath they tell me to stop being an entitled PC master race elitst for wanting resolution changes), my specs are:\n\nTime of this report: 10/10/2014, 01:58:56\n\nOperating System: Windows 8.1 Pro 64-bit (6.3, Build 9600) (9600.winblue_gdr.140723-2018)\nProcessor: Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-4930K CPU @ 3.40GHz (12 CPUs), ~3.4GHz\nMemory: 32768MB RAM\nDirectX Version: DirectX 11\nGPU: 2x NVidia GeForce GTX 780 3GB VRAM in SLI\n\nThe inconsistent performance is happening for people across the board regardless of their specs.\n\nOnce you get past all of that, the game runs and you can play it. So that's a thing. It hasn't crashed on me. But it should be mentioned there are several reports of people who can't launch the game, can't get full screen working, have the game crashing after loading the launcher, and other similar problems.\n\nBUT HEY AT LEAST IT'S ONLY $16 LOL WHAT DID YOU EXPECT??????\n\nI dunno, maybe a port like The Last Remnant which has all the standard configuration options, and even went above and beyond the call of duty by adding extra content and features that make the PC version even better than the console versions for $6 less than what the same company is asking for Final Fantasy XIII?\n\nLastly, yes, there is a pre-alpha community developed mod headed by Durante (of the DSFix and DPFix fame) that lets you tool around with resolutions but also reportedly breaks menus and has other graphical glitches and such (hence: pre-alpha). Also it has no impact on performance (FPS dips, etc) problems. Forgive me for being old fashioned but I kind of think it falls to the devs to offer these kinds of basic functionalities, not modders.","October 9, 2014","false","14.4"," 69 of 129 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","69","129","0","7"

I would, if it were actually playable for me. This is the first game that gave me a migraine from the constant stuttering going on. Keep in mind the hardware requirements for this game are laughably low, and even on my aging machine I exceed them. However the gameplay is a consistent stuttering mess and sucks all joy from the experience.\n\nThe day before release, I had a great feeling of joy that this would be a decent port. After all, Square (or someone) sprang the announcement of Japanese audio on us. Unfortunately that's about the only thing they did right for this game. You have no graphical options beyond windowed and fullscreen mode. No way to change the resoultion, which is locked at 720P. No way to actually exit the game (but escape instantly shuts the game down). But you get that Japanese audio track, right?\n\nAs it stands, I'm not even disappointed with Square. This is only reinforcing the idea that they have no idea how to treat PC gamers, just like most Japanese developers. Very few deliver quality ports, and Square isn't one of the few. Unless there is some major patching of this game in the coming weeks, I'll not be buying the rest of the series.\n\nI guess you do get what you pay for.","October 9, 2014","false","1.1"," 18 of 31 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","18","31","0","0"

What program in this new century doesn't allow for players to pick which keys on their keyboard do things? FFXIII apparently.  Until the graphics resolution and keyboard control features are fixed, the game is pretty much unplayable for me, as I tend to hit the 'ESC' key often to skip movies, or enter a game menu (IN LIKE EVERY OTHER GAME ON THE PLANET!!!!!!).\n\nThe game itself is fine, and the graphics issues for me aren't as serious as others have made them out to be, but the lack of customizability is a deal breaker for me.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/athemhun/recommended/292120/","athemhun","Athem","http://steamcommunity.com/id/athemhun/","274 products in account","First of all:\nI'm playing this series since the snes era, and I'm a big fan of it. However as you may guess, I got too old to hype a game just because it's called Final Fantasy and Square is behind it. That means, what you will read might be pretty accurate. Well it will be up to you to decide that of course.\n\nFinal Fantasy - Only in name?\n\nDefinetly not. How can I say that? Well.. Back then when Final Fantasy V and VI came out on SNES .. do you remember that? You could make decisiont which affected the gameplay and the story a bit. That was awesome. Deep character designs, well developed world and etc. After that Final Fantasy VII came out. You could still make choices but they made LESS impact on the story. However there were mostly improvements like the materia system, side stories and so on. That was obviosly a step ahead technicaly too. The story was better or worse than the previous ones, depending on your taste. Personally (as most of the players) I liked that pretty much. Than Final Fantasy VIII and IX came, and they weren't improved much likely rethinked compared to Final Fantasy VII. They were VERY good games and honestly..why should they change anything if it worked? They couldn't improve the side quests, secrets, mini games more, because of the hardware, so they just revamped the things and it worked.\n\nNow time jump, and everything begins here... Final Fantasy X. Definetly a good Final Fantasy, however already lacking the depth in side quests. (Blitzball was awesome thou.) The story telling went into the "movie style", mostly because the character had voice acting. That was ok and we all knew that they have to keep up with trend and technic.\n\nFinal Fantasy XII... I think that was a "we don't know which way to go" game, since it was pretty much like the MMO version but in offline mode, with better story. Not bad, not good..and not because you couldn't enjoy it but it was a totally revamped thing. The atmosphere was ok.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII Is what we got here. They went back to Final Fantasy X because I think they felt that this is better than the FFXII mmo style, and "improved" that. This is a success. More movie like, faster, more action based but...lacks the things what was still in Final Fantasy X. While there was still some "game" elements, like story development while you play, the feeling that you are respoinsible at least a bit for the things and so on, Final Fantasy XIII is more like a movie. You wont feel that you are making the choices, you won't feel that you are responsible for anything, you won't feel that your characters developed cause of you (more precisly, you wont get this illusion like in the older games), and you wont be sad when you finish the game cause your journey ends.\n\nThat's because we are in 2014 (or 2010 when the game was released) and the trend is the movie style gameplay. It's not as bad as you think, it's definetly a Final Fantasy, just not a game but a movie with many interractions.\n\nShall I play this if I want to play a J-RPG?\nDefinetly, comapred to the J-RPGs on pc, this one is one of the best. Even if it's not good compared to the old Final Fantasy titles, It is pretty good compared to other J-RPGs nowadays.\n\nHowever if Tales Of Vesperia and others will come to PC once, I think I will have to take this back... :P\n\nHm..ok, but should I buy this for 13€?\nIf you like J-RPG and Final Fantasy, I think this is pretty much a good price. The port is cheap and lacks many things, but let's be honest: Who the hell plays games like this without controller?\n\nPros:\n-Nice design.\n-Final Fantasy feeling\n-Actually pretty good combat system\n-Fang\n\nCons:\n-Bad characters. Not just because you can't feel anything special about them, but most of them actually ANNOYING!\n-Too movie like, too linear\n-No mini games. WUT?!\n-Without controller it's masochism\n-Poor port.\n-Hope (Haha, you will definetly know why if you play the game. Tbh I would write Vanille and Snow here too)\n\nWhy thumbs up then?\nEven with this many flaw, even with the annoying characters I still played for hours and couldn't stop. That means: as a game I can recommend that.\n\nI hope this will be help some of you. :)\n\nCheers!","October 30, 2014","true","55.6"," 20 of 35 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","20","35","0","0"

It is the worst port to PC I have ever seen in my life, and I dearly hope to never see one such as this again.\nSo Final Fantasy XIII was released on PC today, and ooooh boy this does not bode well for future Square Enix releases on PC if this is the way they're gonna do it.\nIn the almost 7 hours that have passed since I started the download of the game, till I started writing this, I have maybe been able to play for 15 minutes. The very first BIG problem that we get is that the game is a staggering 49,4 GB download (hue hue big). Oh and while we're at it, the game itself does not just take up 49,4 GB of your harddrive, no actually it takes up 58 GB, yep 58 (that's a LOT). "Well Watch Dogs was also a 50 GB download and that turned out fine right?" Yes and no, but that is unimportant\nAnd so we can be led into the next problem, because what are those 58 GB? Surely that must mean 4k textures and super HD shaders and so on right? Not at all. When you launch it you get a fancy launcher where you can toggle Windowed Mode and the spoken language in the game. There is no video options. What. So. Ever. In this game. It is locked at 720p and there ain't ♥♥♥♥ you can do about it. In 20♥♥♥♥ing14 we have to look to modders for our games to be proper 1080p REALLY?!\n"But if it's not HD textures and all that then what are those 58 GB?" Well funny you should ask. 39,7 GB of those are naught but prerendered cinematics. Yep, if you go into the FFXIII folder in your steamapps, you'll find a small folder called "Movie" and there lies most of your now taken harddrive space. So we are left with a 20 GB 720p game. But enough about that.\nYou enter the game and what are the first thing you realize? No proper mouse control. Okay that has been seen many times. You move the curser by scrolling the mouse wheel, or you use the keyboard, not the worst thing to happen but well take it as it comes. You enter the options menu to check if there is a resolution option somewhere, which of course there isn't, and then proceed to check your controls. There are pseudo rebindable keys, however you are only able to change 6 inputs. Nothing about how you move, look or interact with the world can you touch. Disappointed you proceed to press escape, because you are used to PC gaming, where that is the go-to button for getting back to the previous menu. What happened? Did the game just crash? Nope, it simply closed. For some inexplicable reaason, the escape key COMPLETELY closes the game, and it is only if you play in windowed mode, that you get a prompt that say "Are you sure you wish to exit the game?" Oh you're certainly asking for it that's for sure.\nI highly recommend that you use a controller for this game, because this is an even more barebones port from the consoles than FFVII and VIII. At least those games had proper key remapping, as well as the ability to play in 1080p. This port was made by people who had no idea what the hell they were doing. It is an insult to not only the PC, but especially to the game itself. FFXIII might not be the most loved game in the FF series, but you cannot deny how well it did on the PS3 and 360. One would think that Squeenix's move towards PC ports of their older games, might be proof of what they said a while back about maybe moving towards PC gaming with their main series, however if they do not get their ♥♥♥♥ together, I can guarantee that they will see no sales on PC in the future. I am already forseeing far fewer sales of FFXIII-2 and Lightning Returns, not just because they have ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t stories, but also because the port of XIII is SO bad, that it is probably not worth it. We can only hope that if Squeenix decide to bring FFXV to PC, they do it properly. Maybe they should talk to some of their western collegues about how to do a PC port. I would recommend Ubisoft, Blizzard or BioWare for starters. I think we can already see the solid 0 out of 10 scores streaming onto MetaCritic. And I would almost say that theyare in their every right to be that.\nThis game has NO right to fill 58 GB. Essentially you are simply running a PS3 emulator on your PC, and even then I'd say that emulating the original PS3 disc would probably be better, because then you could most likely get proper 1080p fullscreen. We can only hope that they will patch this game, or that the modders work fast, because right now, I can only say "Do not buy"","October 9, 2014","false","4.4"," 22 of 39 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","22","39","0","0"

I'm a fan of more serious games and haven't been able to play certain games like Final Fantasy X-2 because of just how cringe-worthy everything was.  FFXIII is a solid game with a great cast of voice actors, characters, and phenomenal gameplay with a really interesting plot that's reminiscent of FFX.\n\nHaving said that, locking the graphics at 720p was plain stupid and I can only hope with the next Final Fantasy on Steam they will realize exactly what the consumer base of PC gaming actually wants in a game.  One of the biggest highlights of PC gaming are modifcations and maximizing the graphics potential and I can't fathom why Square Enix would intentionally straddle us with settings that are so outdated.","October 27, 2014","true","147.8"," 23 of 41 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","23","41","0","0"

I have a GTX 970 and this 4 year old game stutters and drops well below 60 fps constantly. The game also doesn't have any graphics options.\n\nThe game itself is fine. Having completed it on the Xbox, it is a good game with some huge flaws. The game has great combat, some good characters and an interesting world. No other JRPG combat comes close to how fun this combat is. It uses  an active time battle system where actions can only be perfomed when a meter is filled. The main goal isn't to select the right attack (by looking at things like weaknesses), the game does that automatically. Your goal is to look at the current situation in the battle and set the state of your party to work with that situation. For example, if one of your part members is low, you need to switch to a state which allows a party member to heal. Switching between these states is fast and the most important part of the battle. This is why the game is set to autobattle by default and is what you should stick with.\n\nThe problem with the game is the linearity. You are constanly walking down a path fighting enemies. There are no branches or side activities. There is no option to go back to older areas which would be a problem if there was anything else to do.\n\nThe game also insults the players intelligence by having the game introduce gameplay concepts incredibly slowly. Where the game could spend 15-20 minutes explaining and allowing the player to try something, it spends 1-2 hours doing so. This leads to the game not unlocking the full potential of the great combat system for several hours (around 15 if I recall). This slow tutorial combined with the lack of side activities means that after the novelty of the new mechanic or idea is gone, you still have to slog through a good hour of gameplay before you get to anything interesting\n\nThe characters are good but are let down by some poor voice acting. It's not just the voice but some of the delivery and animations make some scenes in the game incredible cheesy. The slow pacing of the game also hurts characters because the time between story sections is so long that characters don't seem to grow or change until much later.\n\nWithout the graphical issues, I would give this a 3/5. It's definitely worth trying and it's a game I love despite the flaws but it's not a good purchase until the problems are fixed.","October 10, 2014","false","3.6"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

Especially by a game which bears the names Final and Fantasy in it. Often the actions of the characters seem unclear. The history of Cocoon and Pulse, the fal'Cie and l'Cie lack explaining. There is some kind of logbook (the Datalog) which goes more into detail and I would have wished these stories were told by the characters and not by some dull loading screen und page of text\n\nCharacters (5/10)\nThere are 6 main characters, with close to opposite personalities. Their behavior doesn't change much and after a while their actions and speeches get quiet predictable.\nLightning: Grumpycat the person\nSnow: Mr. Big Talks\nVanile: imagine the most annoyingly happy anime character you can think of.\nHope: Mr "I-blame-you-for-being-responsible-for-the-death-of-my-mom...well-lets-be-BFFs"\nFang: kind of cool character, but lacks emotions\nSahz: My favorite (although I didn't like his chocobo). The most interesting character development of the 6\n\nCombat System 3/10\n-it sucks\n-You only control one of three characters in fight. The other two are controlled by bots. You can put them in certain roles (healer, dps, support, tank) and they act accordingly\n-you've got an action skills bar (called ATB gauge), which fills up over time. Abilities cost a certain amounts of energy, allowing you to cast up to 5 spells in a row\n-instead of choosing spells wisely or controlling other characters you just spam the most efficient spell of one of you characters up to 5 times\n-(DE-)BUFFING IS OVERPOWERED!  That needs some explaining I think.\nThere are three type of damage increasing mechanics in FF XIII. First and second are Buffs and Debuffs. They're applied by your characters onto each other and the enemies. The Buffs are all single target, meaning you will cast each spell 3 times. There are four dmg-increasing buffs (haste +magic +str +elemental dmg) and three dmg-increasing debuffs (-magic/phys resist -elemental resist). There are also four buffs and three debuffs which reduce incoming dmg.\nto win fights later in the game often need all/most of the buffs. So your usual playstyle is (de-)buffing with two characters while the third one is keeping your party alive, then switch all three to dps.\nThe third way of increasing your dmg is staggering. To put it simple, the more often you hit an enemy, the more dmg it will take. After reaching a certain amount of dmg they become staggered, increasing their dmg taken again.\n\nHow is this overpowered? Staggering can stack up to 1000% each (de-)buff increases you dmg by roundabout 50% per buff. They increase each other multiplicative. So there's 1 * 1000% * 150%^4 =~ 5000%. This means you will deal 50 times more dmg. My attacks were capped at 99999, regular trash mobs have around 500k - 1M hp and I attack 5x in a row. At this point everything except bosses just evaporates before you, once you reach that point in the fight. But to get that far, you have to go the long way of casting dozens of buffs. Without buffs you've got a mob of 500k HP and your attacks deal about 3-5k dmg each...have fun.\n\n-the AI is just plain stupid. Lots of enemy attacks are area based, hitting your entire team when they're close together. And since you can’t control other characters and not even move your main char, especially your squishy casters tend to cuddle during fights and get brutally beaten to death...except when they don't and move /get knocked away from each other. There's no way of controlling their behavior. Have fun remaining calm, after you lost three fights in a row because your team is too stupid to move away from each other.\n\n-you lose the fight the moment you main character passes out. You cannot phoenix down him/her. You can only resurrect other members of your party...\n\nLeveling System 5/10\nRemember the great FF X leveling board and enjoyed building your tanking Yuna? Well FF XIII system is kind of like that, but worse. You still have points to spend. But instead of spending them on a FF X -like board, you can spend each character's points on one of the characters role-paths. Each character has three roles (out of six) available to him/her and you get so many skillpoints, that you can master all three. There is no chance of varying anything. Snow will never be a healer and Hope's just to weak to become the tank...\n\n\nOpen World 2/10\nThere is none. Enjoy your hallway simulator\n\n\nGraphics 8/10\nNeat looking graphics, nice cutsceens\n\n\n\n\nTL;DR\nIt's not worth the time. You should just play FF 7-10 another time.","January 23, 2015","false","43.8"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","64","9","14","3","0"

I was also curious to see if the bad reviews were founded: I thought that at worst it would a nice "autopilot" pass-time, something to go through without torturing my brain too much for when I'm tired.\n\n... Unfortunately, the negative reviews were founded. I mean, the graphics are great and I was genuinely intrigued to see how the story would end, but that about ends the positive points. The game as a whole is a linear borefest with a combat system that invites you to spam a single button, except for the occasional super-hard fight. The combat and crafting mechanics are intentionally obscured, and the "paradigm shift" mechanic didn't strike me as very fun. Give me back my turn-based FF combat please.\n\nEven the much-touted "part when it opens up and becomes real Final Fantasy" i.e. chapter 11 consists of a green plain with some scattered generic fetch quests. And then the game becomes a corridor again. I distinctly remember having an impression of epic freedom while I roamed the world in an airship in SNES Final Fantasy RPGs, not so in this game.\n\nIf only the story was well-delivered. Unfortunately most of the time the party has no clue of where they are going or why, and the characters are not very interesting. In the end I made it to chapter 11 to see if it would get better, and then I was so bored that I decided to watch the rest of the cutscenes on Youtube. I'm glad I did. The end cinematic is pretty cool but not worth slogging through the whole game.\n\nThere are two sequels, XIII-2 and XIII-3, but honestly I'm not even interested in watching their stories. I'll go play some actual good classic JRPGs I missed or watch a real movie instead.","August 2, 2015","false","24.1"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

I am glad that FF took a bit of a leap to do something new, but people hate change. If you are one of those players don't play/buy this game.\n\nYes the game has issues but so does every game EVER.\n\nThe game is very linear, gives you one straight line with no exploration to talk about until you get to a certain point, thats about 10hours into the game. The Graphics is really beautiful, but some people have issues with fps drops and stuttering on the game.\n\nI really am enjoying the Battle System, the way you have to shift your paradigms to fit to your strategy, this also tries to make the game harder in a sense as you have to select "medic" to get someone to use a healing spell. The most fights is really boring at times as you have 10sec of a fight and then 5meters later another 10sec of the same type of fight but for the boss fights you really have to know when to swap your paradigm and this makes it interesting.\n\nThe storyline is confusing at first but they kinda try and explain it to you, with flashbacks. Some characters are really irritating and some you really learn to like. (But thats how the real life is, you don't always like everyone)\n\nThe upgrading of your gear could have been done differently, it's a bit boring and you don't always know what to do. The same with the leveling up of your crystarium, also they only get you to upgrade to a point every time, but this stops you from becoming overpowering.\n\nAs a last note:\nThis game is fun to play, really spoon feeds you most of the game, and the fights become bland and tedious as they are short and almost always the same. The game does not have any real exploration features and might make this a boring game for some as you only have one option, moving the way the corridor is leading you to. SE really tried to do something different they didn't make a flop neither was it a masterpiece but this is still a game worth playing if you can get past the 10hour tutorial.","March 9","true","23.4"," 9 of 14 people (64%) found this review helpful","64","9","14","0","0"

I lose all respect for companies that launch games just to win a quick buck.\n\n\nAdded this after playing the game for about 20 hours:\n\nSo i have been playing FFXIII for over 20 hours and i have come to the comclusion this game is pretty good!\n\nFirstly, how was i able to play it? I used a mod, link below.\n\nhttp://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?p=618\n\nThis guy pretty much saves the game. If only Square Enix bothered as much.\n\nAnyway back to the game.\n\nThe story isn't as good  as other FF stories, but it's not bad. The characters are cool and you don't get that feeling of "why do i have to play with this guy?" anymore.\nThe combat system is very good. Takes the classic combat system you  had in the previous games and makes it better and more user friendly.\nThe Eidolons tho... i don't know how they did it, but they managed to make them both cool and awkward. One secod you're like "what the hell is this?" the next you're "oh wow, this is so cool!"\n\n\nThis is a good game and it's fun to play. What else can you ask for?\n\nChanged my review to recomended, thanks to a mod.","November 5, 2014","true","78.1"," 10 of 16 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","10","16","0","0"

And ended up creating a few more problems in the process like FMVs now stuttering\nList of issues currently remainingLow volume. The game currently has about 20dBfs worth of headroom until it hits the noise ceiling of -0.0dBfs\nNo volume slider.

When it doesn't, the result is microstuttering or what is commonly known now as "Frame pacing issues")\n(Ignore the drops down to 0 as that is normal with a fast polling rate)  You will want to notice however, the lines between those gaps. This should be a flat line like this http://u.cubeupload.com/MrBonk/wcap.jpg So in battle, the game is constantly spiking frames upwards of 33ms. Causing the game to stutter and drop frames.\nNo stable framerate caps available. See the above. Need 30FPS,60FPS and unlocked frame caps. You can stabilize performance by using a 30FPS cap and 1/2 refresh rate Vsync. But that doesn't do anything for 60FPS.\nSub-par low resolution ultra compressed Bink FMVs\n60GB DL FOR THE ABOVE VIDEOS.

Being a long time fan of RPGs, I was overjoyed yet somewhat cautious to buy this game, as reviews were generally mixed.  Upon completing the main story, I can say that while many of the issues raised by Final Fantasy fans (linearity, character development) are legitimate, for the most part Final Fantasy 13 is a decent RPG.  This is in large part due to the game's fairly interesting story, excellent character/monster design, innovative combat system, and of course beautiful CGI.\n\nThat is the TL:DR version of my review.  I would definitely recommend this title to anyone that enjoys RPGs, even if as a Final Fantasy game it is not one of Square Enix's best titles to date.\n\nNow if you're a long time Final Fantasy fan or would like to read a more detailed analysis, read on for the pros and cons!\n\nPROS\n\n- The overall storyline is fairly well-written and creative, even if it falters at times due to a lack of interesting characters or confusing developments.  Right off the bat the game places you in a conflict between the high-tech, futuristic world of Cocoon and the lower, more primordial world of Pulse.  You are Lightning and you start your journey in Cocoon as a soldier turned rebel.  Eventually you make your way to Pulse, meeting new friends and enemies as you uncover your destiny.  This is primarily a battle of good vs. evil but also a story of friendship, love, and personal growth.\n\n- Character design, world design, and monster design, are a treat to look at.  The first thing that drew me to this game were the cool-looking characters and the awesome cut scenes.  If this sounds like you, you will not be disappointed.  Square Enix artists and design crew did a fantastic job on this game's aesthetics, especially with the cut scenes, which are cutting edge and a pleasure to watch.\n\n- The soundtrack for this game is good.  Compared to previous installments, I would say the soundtrack is much more subtle and subdued.  I am a big fan of Lightning's theme and the introduction theme, although they are not quite on par with some of the legendary sound tracks of the past, like "To Zanarkand"  and "Suteki Da Ne" from Final Fantasy X or "Melodies of Life" from Final Fantasy IX.\n\n- The leveling system (called the Crystarium) is simple and customizeable.  If you remember the Sphere Grid in Final Fantasy X, this will seem very intuitive.  There are six roles available: Commando(offensive fighter), Ravager (offensive mage), Medic (healer), Synergist (buff expert), Saboteur (debuff expert), and Sentinel (tank).   Initially you can choose to invest your experience points (called Command Points in this game) in one of two roles per character but later you unlock the ability to teach ANY character ANY role.  This offers a lot of freedom for the player to evolve each character as he/she sees fit.   Generally speaking, however, as you progress you will learn that each character is naturally inclined toward one or two of the six roles.\n\n- Fluid and dynamic combat system with some strategic depth.  This game introduces the new Paradigm combat system, which is essentially a streamlined version of the Final Fantasy XII system.  Similar to the combat system in Final Fantasy XII, you only directly control one of the up to three members in your party while the AI controls the others.  The AI behaves according to what role each character currently has.  For example if the character Hope is assigned the Medic role, he will heal wounded characters and remove debuffs from those afflicted with status changes like Poison.  These roles can be switched IN REAL TIME during any battle by shifting Paradigms, which are set configurations of roles for your active party members.\n\nWhat all this complexity means is that the Paradigm system brings a key strategic element to every battle that makes boss fights and normal monster fights interesting and fun.  Each enemy and boss typically have specific weaknesses to certain elements or are susceptible to certain debuffs.   Furthermore, Final Fantasy XIII's monsters/bosses are often powerful and require strategy to defeat.  Therefore, in order to secure victory in battle the player must adapt and exploit enemies' weaknesses by using the appropriate Paradigm.  The player is rewarded for quick and efficient Paradigm useage by a high rating at the end of every battle, which translates into higher drop rates of rare items.  The net effect is that the Paradigm system creates a dynamic, rewarding, and most importantly fun combat experience that makes each encounter with a new enemy a unique and satisfying challenge.\n\n\nCONS\n\n- Character development and individual storylines are somewhat dull, regrettably.   In Final Fantasy VII Cloud's mysterious past and his conflict with the evil Sephiroth drove the story.  In Final Fantasy X the story of Tidus and his tie to the antagonist Sin or Yuna's pilgrimage and her noble spirit were quite compelling and memorable.   In this game, we have Lightning who is a no-nonsense soldier with very little tolerance for ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t.  Very little is told about her mysterious past.  The friends you meet are actually more interesting, albeit slightly.  Sazh and Hope, two of the characters who join you early on, do have unique and compelling personalities to be fair.  However, many of the other characters you meet lack depth or simply boring.  As a result, the individual character storylines of Final Fantasy XIII are largely forgettable.\n\n- Level/world design and storyline is extremely linear.  First of all this game completely does away with the overworld.  You do not have the ability to wander around and explore new and secret levels/dungeons.  You generally have one path to take, making the game feel like one long dungeon.   Limiting freedom and exploration generally hurts my gaming experience; in my opinion, more choices equals more fun.  Sadly, in Final Fantasy 13 there simply aren't many choices that actually affect the story.\n\n- Combat system AI can feel very restrictive.  Due to the fact that the game controls 2/3 of your party in every battle, the player never truly has full control over the party's behavior.  Also the AI handles certain roles rather poorly, especially any character with the Medic role (the AI will overheal other characters or prioritize spells poorly).\n\n- Lastly, there are some annoying port issues (such as stuttering, loss of frames, etc.) that Square Enix did not seem to catch before release.  Thankfully, a recent patch has fixed most of these issues and there are now adjustable graphics settings.\n\nOverall, as the successor to Final Fantasy XII, this game doesn't quite live up to its potential.  The beautiful graphics and innovative combat system have progressed nicely but the character development and sound tracks are painfully lacking.  As a result, I would say that this is one of my least memorable Final Fantasy games in the series despite it being a decent RPG in its own right.\n\nFor seasoned veterans this game may be disappointing in some ways but there are definitely many bright spots like the exciting new combat system, impressive graphics, and overall interesting storyline.  For $16, I would recommend at least one playthrough for any fan of the RPG genre.\n\nFINAL RATING: 7.5/10, good but not great","October 17, 2014","true","66.5"," 12 of 20 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","12","20","0","1"

You can then revert to your regular desktop resolution. The next time you run the game it will display correctly but it WILL look like butt. It will just look less like butt than it would have before. I have no idea how to fix it on NVidia GPUs but I assume the procedure will be similar.\n\nFor the review I will say the game doesn't run at 60 FPS it is clearly running at about half that. You can tell as soon as the first video plays after starting a new game. I just spent 3 hours trying to get the game working correctly and I have not yet actually played more than the first couple of minutes. I will update my review accordingly as I make progress. I just wanted to be sure I posted some fixes for the game so noone else has to spend 3 hours fixing the issues like I just did.\n\nUpdate 1\nAfter playing about 15 minutes I noticed the game consisted of alternating between holding forward on the analog stick and mashing the A button and I often found myself looking for other things to do. So as an experiment I created a video in which I play the game and simultaniously perform other tasks like making tea, reading a book, and watching firefly on netflix.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ViuPzr-Dm7A\n\nThe game plays like an endless cutscene. The battles are shallow and rarely require any intervention. There are moments when it releases control of the characters back to you just for you to walk 10 feet before it initiates another cutscene. The story isn't explained and the characters talk as if they expect you to know everything already. The characters are played out overused cliched archetypes with the depth of a shot glass. I feel like this game tarnishes Sakaguchi's legacy and drags it through the mud in a very unforgiveable way.","October 9, 2014","false","58.5"," 29 of 53 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","29","53","0","0"

Compared to the Playstation 1-2 classics (FFVII, FFVIII, FFX, etc.), this will be the least intersting, challenging and interactive sequel of its time. For starters, this is a completely linear story, no exploration, no interaction with people, no shops, no towns, no side quests.\n\nWhile I typically don't mind being on a rail of an expansive story, the narration is by far the worst ever told where so many terms are comfortably used without properly introducing the player what the hell it all means; thankfully they included a datalog to explain all the necessary, but apparently too trivial to incorporate in real-time, information. Final Fantasy XIII intentionally skimps out on a lot of details to reveal a bunch of cheap "twists" that you have an inkling is going to happen or something of that sort as you play through.\n\nThe biggest gaffe to the game is the strategy, or lack of. It's so bad that I am actually writing a proper review for this game. Final Fantasy XIII does away with all sort of customization both in leveling as it is a shadow version of Final Fantasy X's sphere grid and equipment consists of an Accessory Slot and Weapon Slot with no real way to improve them besides chucking found items and boosting their stats. It's not very complex, elaborate or even that cool. For the majority of the game, the weapons hardly vary and pretty much offer better stat of your two stats: Magic/Strength (Magic/Physical). Since there are no shops in-game, you do all your purchasing through randomly placed books that let you buy items, save and upgrade your weapons, no real interface, customization or aesthetics, just menus and menus.\n\nLet's not forget that you only control one character at a time. You don't control all three in battle, you control one and switch "roles" of all three when you want to be more aggressive, support/healing or more defensive/disruption (slow, haste, protect, etc.). It's a very unique system, but limiting in strategy and even more limiting in how to approach foes. To add, you don't get to control any three characters for the majority of the game, so you're individually leveling different characters and their stories throughout most of the plot. Their leveling is slow and some roles (such as the Sentinel Role or Saboteur) gets only one ability or two abilities. It's cumbersome, slow and hinders the entire pace of the battle for what they thought was an innovative system.\n\nEverything that made Final Fantasy itself is gone: No Blitzball or Triple Triad minigame, no collectible Guardian Forces, nothing. Eidolons are the equivalent, but they're awkward, lifeless and there are very few of them. You summon them, they can do a limited amount of attacks and then they vanished. There is no real grandiose spectacle of their attacks that I would consider on par with the other games and certainly not as memorable.\n\nThe characters are also the most disliked people in the entire series. Without a clear antagonist highlighted or underlined for the majority of the game, you turn your hate towards the main characters who are very shallow in backstory and mostly hypocritical ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s, I'll summarize it for you without any real spoilers (most of these are the premise of the game):\n\n*play with Japanese audio and save your ears from the over-Americanizing of the characters, trust me.\n\nLightning: Emo ♥♥♥♥♥ who changed her name to be cool. Loves her sister, though they never show a moment when that was. Suppose to be cold-hearted and tactical, comes off as a lifeless ♥♥♥♥♥ who needs to experience high-school again.\n\nVanille: Pedophile Thermometer.  She's 19 but you're never quite sure. Her mannerisms and constant narration that surrounds around a shrouded "dark past" is perhaps the most cliche situation ever. Agatha Christie couldn't even use this character. She is the summation of every dramatic asian show you've watched and went "oh brother". Your eyes will roll like a locomotive as soon as you hear her speak and then listen to what she says, does and is so blatantly bothered with (but keeps up a happy appearance).\n\nSnow: Obnoxious ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. He is every "that friend" who is Tidus from Final Fantasy X with a pretend naivete to everyone he uses for his way. He's not selfish or an ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, on the contrary, he comes off as overliked, obnoxious to the point that you want to puke at his "for family, for glory" schtick. His motivation in this game is cliche, a romeo & juliet kind of deal.\n\nFang: There's really nothing to say about her. She's more of a plot tool than anything else.\n\nHope: The worst of the worst. Don't believe anything this ♥♥♥♥er says or does. He's a massive little ♥♥♥♥ and a whiny one at that. His emotions and views towards people change almost instantly and what he says about his family is contradicted by the series of events that actually occur. For 14 years old, he stills calls his mother "mommy" and continues to ♥♥♥♥♥ and moan even when he has chance to talk about it. In every sense, he's that kid in the corner that you know has anger and frustration problems, but is too much of a massive tool to mention it; he just lets it fester and makes everyone around him miserable.\n\nThis game is melodramtic. They try to make it seem like the worlds are tearing themselves apart and try to promote moralities, but in truth, every one involved is melodramatic, exaggerating and disliked. Beautiful music (though not as memorable), beautiful cutscenes (too many though) and beautiful world. Everything else can go to hell and should be promptly talked down whenever mentioned. I didn't even get to talk about the lack of options and controls in the PC Version of this game: it's not even 1080p.","November 11, 2014","false","55.2"," 32 of 59 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","32","59","0","4"

Leave it to Squenix to half-bake something for the PC.  The've done it with a fair number of their other PC games.  FFXI as well as FFXIV both come to mind, and they were even intended for the PC.  There's no quit option, you basically just save your game and then press ESC which just closes the game without asking or anything.\n\nResolution is locked to 720p, which would have been fine 10 years ago.  Nothing like basically losing half the screen on my 16:10 monitor to giant black bars on the top and bottom.  There is a 3rd party fix for it (just like there was for FFXI), but unfortunately it makes the menus unreadable for me.  Maybe I'll be able to get them to work properly with the 3rd party tool, maybe not.  In the unlikely event that Squenix gets their head out of the ground and fixes these issues, I would more than likely change this to a recommended game, but as it is you should avoid it.\n\nAs somebody who hasn't owned a console since the PS2, I was actually looking forward to finally getting to play this game.  I guess from now on the takeaway is going to be wait and see and not pre-order older but well recieved games - especially from Squenix.\n\nedit: Looks like they've heard our complaints and will be adding custom resolutions shortly in December.  Supposedly they fixed the "ESC" instantly closes the game issue recently.  I will check on it again after the custom resolutions are added, hopefully changing the review to a thumbs up at that point.","October 9, 2014","false","71.4"," 16 of 28 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","16","28","0","0"

Won't be taking in consideration of the 720p and nonsense like that (I am just glad to be able to play FF on PC again).\n\nBut even without taking considerations of the fact that it is a horrible port; the game is still pretty bad. You have a bunch of very ridiculous and annoying characters this time around. Lightning is a cloud wannabe (ok this is still tolerable actually) , Afro (forgot his name) is the voice of reason and then there is a lady with a sari; Fang; these 3 here are the 'normal' ones.\n\nThe abnormals ones include constantly ♥♥♥♥♥♥ic high pitched Vanille, you-killed-my-mother-but-I-am-too-shy-to-talk-about it Hope (he is also incredibly emo) and 10-year-old-hero-wannabe-in-adult's-body Snow.  I just don't know where to start. This not how you do character progression godanggit! I don't care if they have a tragic history, a hidden agenda or 'it's get better at the end' but this is not how you tell a character's story! Read more books before you write out horrid character development like this for heaven sake! Even if a character has a hidden agenda or tragic history; they are much better way to flesh them out and make them interesting! Go watch GoT or something and learn a thing or 2. GAH.\n\nGame is so damn linear that it nearly felt like I am playing a cutscene (actually I felt like I am playing a VERY LONG tutorial). You don't have access to the world until you are about to fight the last boss. I will give a little bit credit in the setting of the game being interesting. But jargons are too overused that the gamer felt lost in the game setting. Certain stuffs that are important to the plot is not being explained until later in the game. I really hate to pause the game and wiki all the jargons they are speaking just to know what the ♥♥♥♥ they are talking about. Very poor writing here once again.\n\nIt's very easy to feel disconnected the game and it's difficult to immerse into the story of the game. You will feel like you are a third party watching everything that is happening instead of being involved with the events in the game.\n\nCombat is so-so. It is quite fun with all the stance juggling and stuff but it can get VERY repetitive. Then again most RPGs ARE repetitive in nature so I will not hold this agaisnt XIII (see? I am reasonable and lenient! I try my very best to actually love this game).\n\nFelt bad giving such a hard review on this game despite buying the game to encourage more JRPGs being released on PC. But having played JRPGs like Shadow Hearts 2, Terranigma, Last Story, Pandora Tower and Xenoblade Chronicles; this game is just outright ridiculous. Perhaps my expectations were too high.\n\nFor JRPGs  fan out there who love FF; I would recommend this game if you are a die hard fan. If you are not; I will definitely ask you to stay away from it and not waste your time. My only hope in finishing this is because I heard the next instalment is much better (and I hope this is true).","October 12, 2014","false","25.8"," 33 of 61 people (54%) found this review helpful","54","33","61","0","0"

Grasping desperately for the help we so often want, towards the silent comfort of another right beside us, with hearts seeking purpose, seeking the answer to the conflict within our heart and mind. Only for it to be violently ripped away, lost beyond the focuses of our reach. Anger, confusion, despair become a tumultuous mess within the captivity of the cage we withhold from others. Until you feel, in the distance blooms a shiny new haven, a future worth fighting for. Releasing the ties that bind you.\n\nConfused? Haha, as was I. When I started my play through this game I was met with great confusion because I asked myself:\n\n“Would I enjoy this game?”\n\nAnd again it occurred once more when I saw Square were going to port FFXIII onto pc. I was a bit overwhelmed, but decided to give it a chance.\n\nThe Hope\nMy expectations/hope when I first started playing this game was somewhat like this:\n\n“Man, hope the story doesn’t disappoint.”\n“Wonder how many hours I’ll put into this.”\n“Wonder if I can grind a lot.”\n\nAnd so on... My thoughts were primarily on such topics regarding this game. And I can say with confidence,  IT DOESN’T DISSAPOINT . For one, I expected myself to be lost in direction like any other standard rpg, but I wasn’t. I was held by the hand throughout the game, which was cool in a way, because it offered a different experience from “Here have a shot.” yes there were times of great freedom, but throughout most of the time I felt someone was guiding me through my adventure in Cocoon(The game world).\n\nFrom that moment on I knew this game would be different from previous Square games. And you know what. It was!\n\nMy previous thoughts of what An RPG should be were shattered as I was continually held by the hand each time through this game, and this is not to say it was irritating or annoying or I had a great dislike for. No, I realized FFXIII was a game ported to the west with different approaches to the genre of RPG’s. And with such a different approach came with it change. And that change my friends are the traditional view we often associate with previous games from Square.\n\nI was happy and intrigued at this new direction Square was trying to achieve, with a different way of structuring the battle instead of turn based combat (granted it still is turn based combat) and yet, they brought a new change:\n\nI.	How battles are fought.\nII.	Traditional premise of our sense of direction.\nIII.	Storytelling like an epic novel.\nIV.	Powerful resonating themes of the Soul.\n\nThe New War\nFor me, I’m rowing my boat of enjoyment throughout the game! Beginning-middle-end. I absolutely enjoyed playing FFXIII, because it offered a different approach to traditional battles I was so accustomed to. Yes there was still a time to wait, but this time I could switch roles and tactics while keeping an eye onto the real time battle ahead. It gets even more complicated when you have to consider additional values of possible danger, when multiple enemies of the same type show up against you, or when diverse groups of enemies coordinate your downfall.\n\nThese roles were flexible; you could be the leader, or a mage, or a shield, de-buffer, buffer, medic, etc. It matters solely on your matter of play style. I couldn’t grind in an area to become overpowered and just steamroll my enemies to death with button smashing auto-battle forever, I had to play it cool, safe, smart, and etc.\n\nBecause this game strays away from my expectations of grinding in a spot then move on, it wanted me to move on, to move to the next area, and see the new cut-scene to unfold the shroud covering the story-line. This is why I didn’t want to grind so much in an area, because then I would miss previous information from the cut-scene because I was grinding so hard, that it becomes just a dissolving thought, gone into the wind. There was one good thing to come from not grinding, and that was it kept enemies challenging to me, since I was weak!\n\nAs such, this new direction in how battles are fought gave it a plus in my book for now. Even maps were changed! Going for linearity which is baffling since this is a jrpg. Nevertheless I welcomed this new concept into a jrpg because it’s as if the game wants me to move on, to keep going, and not stay bogged down into an area. Yes, I could’ve grinded, but I wanted to see more of the story unfold, hence why I kept on moving.\n\nConvergent Crossroads\nHmmm, Story-Time...\n\nIt’s hard to express to someone in simple terms but here’s the gist.\n\n6 Unfortunate souls are intertwined, through unlikely circumstances, in a race against time to save their world; loved ones, and themselves.\nEach character is unique concerning their own background and relationship with one another, they all share a common curse of loss and a race against time, and yet they must somehow work together to save the world they live in. It’s an arduous and monument us task, daunting for some, and yet for this group it’s difficult to even work together, let alone without their differences clashing with one another. But, somehow, someway they must confront the coming darkness ahead.\n\nLike a book, the game is mainly told through a series of cut scenes and log entries stored within your catalog. If you enjoy reading + playing games, then it should come to no surprise how much you’ll read and read again and again. It doesn’t imo diminish the overall combination of it within the game. But, rather rewards the player who hungers for more background knowledge and punishes the unworthy with just a dialogue to follow only. It’s also worth noting because I kept on progressing, more data entries would pop-up than grinding for some hours at the same old boring spot.\n\nCrystal Clear\nAt the end of the day; after defeating the final boss, seeing the final cut scene, seeing the credits. I felt strangely content at the work I managed. Exploring the beautiful landscapes and areas coupled with the right atmospheric/unique music to set the tone and setting of the place traveled. A unique set of individuals struggling to defy fate’s chains and an epic story to grab hold of you from start to finish.\n\nHate is easy, and yet to forgive is harder to do so, because we cling onto the memories of the joyous past that gives us meaning, hope, and the will struggling through. No matter the danger, no matter the horrors that face the lies that erupt from masks. All the remains from which, you struggle against time itself and the destiny of fate’s clockwork. We dream, we pray, and wish for miracles, and promises to become  Heroes .\n\nThe Path of Heroes begins with?\n\nTotal times Beaten: 1 (normal)\nLegit: 0.75\nScore: 9.5/10\nScore is based off how much I enjoyed the game)\n(Legit is based off no cheating whatsoever, no guides, walkthroughs, video’s advice, etc.)\n\nDate Reviewed: 10-20-14\n","October 20, 2014","true","64.4"," 20 of 36 people (56%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","56","20","36","0","5"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaplinbeats/recommended/292120/","chaplinbeats","Nawnee","http://steamcommunity.com/id/chaplinbeats/","244 products in account","Update:\n\nWith no word from Square Enix about a possibe patch, and no comments on the games performance, i can no longer recommend the purchase. I honestly thought these problems would be patched by now, however it is becoming clear that Square Enix TRULY doesn't care about the PC as a platform for gaming.  If they leave the game like this, don't buy it, just "get it from somewhere else" *wink, wink* it's what they deserve.\n\n---------------------------Additional Findings----------------------------------\n\nUpdated:October 11th, 2014 @ 5:30 PM\nPlaytime:~5 hours\n\nSo I am about 5 hours into the game at the time of writing this update. Throughout my additional 4 hours of playtime I have noticed a couple of things. The lag is not going away further in game so get used to it. I have noticed the lag to be Somewhat Consistent throughout each of the levels so far (and SOME of the battles have no lag at all). More visually impressive environments and levels seem to have little affect on the performance, the game just always seems to lag and stutter consistently (most likely due to how the "texture and lighting" Load Subsystems are put together, but that is just a guess).  Dont worry it really is playable in my opinion, I am a Gamer who considers framerate to be one of the most important factors to consider when playing a game, and bad framerates have kept me from enjoying many different games. Dead Rising 3, Assassins Creed 3, and GTA 4 (one of my all-time favorite games) are all examples of games whose experiences were negatively affected by poor performance. 5 hours into the game and I can say one thing for sure, this game DEFINITELY has poor performance. In my opinion this is the biggest (and really the only) serious problem this port has. So far at least.\n\nThe Controls are tight (at least when using a gamepad) and the resolution really doesn't bother me. I downloaded Durante's fix to upscale the resolutions to 1080p bilinearly and I ended up scaling back down to 1280x720 with AA forced on. (in my opinion upscaling to 1080p made the game look great, but made the HUD extremely pixelated and ugly). The game honestly looks just as brilliant in 1280x720 as it does in 1080p (aside form the minor aliasing which can be fixed with Durante's update). The voiceover Audio quality is stellar, in both Japanese and English, and you can freely switch back and forth between japanese and english audio during your playthrough (no need to start a new game to change language settings, however language is changed out-of-game, so you will need to quit and restart if you want to hear the other voice-overs). The same could be said about the quality of the music. It's as amazing and beautiful as it ever was, and you already know that if your'e a fan of any FF game.\n\nI still haven't experienced any of the crashing or Glitching that others have claimed to experience, however i am only 5 hours or so into the game. I am still thouroughly enjoying my laggy, stuttery, Adventure through FFXIII. But here's to hoping that Square Enix is working on a Patch to improve performance, i suppose we will have to wait and see (fingers crossed). If you can muscle through some lag and can entertain yourself during the LONG download then i still recommend picking it up for its $15.99 asking price. I am still taking notes on what I am experiencing and will continue to update these impressions as I progress.\n\n------------------------FIRST MPRESSIONS--------------------------\nKeep in mind that Everything that Follows is my personal opinion:\n\nI personally feel that most of the Negative reviews on here are slightly exaggerated, I understand the dissapointment that the community is feeling,  but It really isnt all THAT bad. Yes It's true, this IS a terrible port, Square Enix should have done a MUCH better job. However If you're someone who loved FFXIII (like me) then it really shouldnt bother you too much. If you have always wanted to play FFXIII on your PC then this version is still worth the $15.99 asking price (in my opinion). keep in mind It DOES lag and stutter quite a bit but it's not TOO noticeable in battles. It mainly lags when you are running around the world and orientating the camera. The cutscenes look great (in my opinion) and dont stutter at all for the most part. Throughout the game you probably won't see TOO much aliasing except for when you are in-game, the cutscenes tend to look quite smooth comparitively. I have seen many people complain about the controls, but in my experience; if you use an Xbox One/Xbox 360 Controller and change the in-game button prompts to use "gamepad prompts" instead of "Keyboard prompts" in the Title screens' settings menu, then you really shouldn't have any noticeable trouble with the controls. Now onto the screen resolution problems. This game has NO resolution settings (the only option you get is to run the game in either windowed or fullscreen), however this doesn't matter too much if you happen to have a 16:9 display. I am playing on a 50" LCD TV at 1776x1000 and I don't see hardly any problems (aside from the aforementioned minor aliasing in-game). However if you are a person whose display is a 16:10 ratio, i can't say for sure that you won't have problems with the games resolution (I have heard that a modder has made a fix for the resolution problems). I haven't experienced ANY of the crashing or glitches that have been described and i found that using a microsoft gamepad fixes the "instantly quits when you hit escape" problem.\n\nThe real down-side to this port is the fact that nothing seems compressed, having to download 49.4 GBs of data for a game that came out on the XBOX 360 and PS3 is kind of ridiculous. ESPECIALLY when you realize that there are no higher resolution textures then there were in the original game (which WOULD make up for the size of the game if they WERE there, which they are NOT).  I believe most of the extra space is due to the fact that languages for the games audio and text are not region locked to what country you downloaded it in. What do i mean by this? Well, Everybody who downloads the game has to download Both Japanese and English audio files as well as different languages for all the text in the game: German, Italian, Spanish, and French ON TOP of having english and Japanese. Being able to decide on either Japanese or English audio is actually a really welcomed addition, however the amount of data that decision ended up adding to the game kind of ruined its practicality.\n\nNow you might have read this review and concluded that this game is not worth buying, and in many ways that is probably true; however, if you have got some free time for a long download and plenty of space on your hard drive, Then I sincerely do recommend this game for the $15.99 asking price, It's still beautiful and it's still FFXIII on my PC. Which i never thought would happen. I am only an hour or so into the game and these are only my first impressions, i will continue to update this review If more problems appear down the road.\n\nSystem Specs:\n-8gb Kingston Hyper X fury ram\n-AMD FX 6300 CPU ~3.8 Ghz w/stock heatsink\n-MSI R9 270 Gaming OC at 1050 Mhz\n-Corsair Cx-750 Watt PSU\n-WD blue 1TB HD\n-MSI 970A-G46 Motherboard","October 11, 2014","false","9.4"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

It's a bold deviation from the norm in the Final Fantasy series, and I commend them for that. Unfortunately, for someone who has played the original version on Playstation 3 for hours on end, I can't bring myself to reccommend this version to anyone. This is an insult to us Final Fantasy fans.\nFINAL FANTASY XIII PC is whittled with bugs, crashes, and graphical glitches. Not to mention the annoying frame skipping despite them unlocking the framerate from 30 to 60 fps. It is also locked at a measly 720p, which for those of you with 1366x768 monitors shouldn't be that noticeable. However my monitor is at 1920x1080, and the image gets blown way up, making details look fuzzy. Now, normally, this wouldn't be much of an issue for me. I don't really care about resolution as long as the game is playable. But what's annoying is the constant pauses and frame skips that the game does, cutscene or not. I have an NVIDIA GTX Titan Black Edition + Intel Core i7 Extreme OC @4.8 GHz combo (In other words, FAR superior to the reccommended requirements) so I should not be getting frame skips on any game whatsoever, much less this one. There are zero (count them) ZERO graphical options to lower or raise the quality of any part of the game to increase or lessen the load on your PC. The movement in this version is a tad wonky as well, making your character jerk from animation to animation whenever you move. Some npc's will randomly disappear and the mouse controlled camera is... something left to be desired. Top that with the numerous crashes, for 60 GB and 15 bucks, this is not worth your time.\nThere aren't many positive points, but one that I would consider a plus is the Japanese voiceovers. I watch anime regularly, and listening to the cast speak in their native language is rather refreshing for me. Another plus is someone is already working on a patch for this game to get 1080p and hopefully fix some of the bugs and frameskips.\nSo I would wait until a patch comes out to address these issues before buying this game. The game itself is amazing, as I've said before. But this version... I'm sorely disappointed in Square-Enix. They're far better than this. Yet it seems they've gotten lazy lately.","October 11, 2014","false","101.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cowwy/recommended/292120/","cowwy","cowwy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cowwy/","263 products in account","I'm genuinely curious at this point if Square Enix is just completely incompetent at porting games to PC, doesn't care, or just flat out hates PC gamers.\n\nIt absolutely boggles the mind how they can release such an atrocious port of a console game and not give even the most BASIC options. First of all the game is locked at 720p, there's no graphics options at all, the visual quality is noticeably worse than the xbox or PS3 versions, and there's no volume setting at all. That is absolutely ridiculous, this is now at least the second time a volume setting has been completely omitted from a SE port, and it's completely inexcusable.\n\nAt first when I was playing I noticed some poor performance with FPS drops being regular occurences, and chalked it up to myself not having the best hardware, but apparently (and while some of it may still be my PC) a lot of other users are experiencing FPS drops on excellent rigs as well, so SE screwed the pooch on optimization as well.\n\nAs far as I'm aware half the keybindings as well aren't changeable, with the most annoyingly omnipresent one being the escape key. Press it once, no matter where you are or what you're doing in game will immediately close the game without giving a popup confirmation. How this button stayed as it is without anyone saying anything during the porting process confuses and saddens me.\n\nAll these technical issues alone are enough to make me recommend everyone to stay away from this game, and that's not even going in to any of the "gameplay". I played this game for about 45ish hours on xbox before giving up and leaving the game unfinished, which is why I bought it on PC, to finally finish the game. However the litany of technical issues might make me give up long before I can finish the game.\n\nOn to the "gameplay"; the game is a long series of hallways for about 20-30 hours, at which point you get a tiny bit of freedom to run around a somewhat open world and do a series of missions where you go to a certain place and kill a certain enemy. The combat system is very lackluster, giving the impression of gameplay for any onlookers without actually having any gameplay really save changing paradigms mid fight, the rest of your time is spent mashing the space bar to do auto battle as quickly as possible. You only ever have to control one character, the other one or two in your party will control themselves based upon which paradigm they're in. The gameplay is extremely tedious, you don't even get the ability to switch paradigms until about 2 hours in, and you feel like you're in a tutorial for about 15-20 hours of the game, which is slow pacing at best, and maddeningly infuriating at worst.\n\nThe story is a typical Final Fantasy affair, our main characters are all citizens of Cocoon when they are slated to be killed by the Purge, a massacre of civilians under the guise of exile, just due to the fact that they were near contact with a fal'Cie. Very little is explained about anything in this particular universe really, what exactly a fal'Cie is or does never really gets explained, and there are tons of glaring plotholes littered throughout the story that are just completely glossed over, which is to be expected from a Final Fantasy game but this one in particular really hits the ground running with the confusion it gives and never really stops.\n\nTL;DR\n\nDon't buy the game on PC. I would recommend not buying it at all but if you want to play it I would highly recommend playing it on Xbox 360 or PS3. Both give much better graphics quality and better stability.","October 10, 2014","false","23.1"," 23 of 42 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","23","42","0","3"

Very limited options (no resolution options or key bindngs), controller support is splotchy at best (my xbox controller for windows doesn't work at all in game and apparently can't rebind buttons), the ESC key closes the game (no warning, just straight to desktop). Seems if I want to play this I must do it on my PS3 else risk tossing my keyboard through my monitor like a ninja star. And to people who think these issues are petty, go fly a kite. PC games have standards (mostly) and proper I/O (input/output) of devices is essential. [/redacted]\n\nSquare has fixed most of what was wrong above. Escape, even in full screen mode now has a prompt rather than a seizure to desktop, my controller now works properly, and there is even a choice in display resolution with other glittery options. The game is actually quite lovely. The comment below about he boring gameplay is still accurate, however credit is deserved for Square actually listening and fixing their game.\n\nThe story was very unappealing to me. Lightning was a very bland character with the personality of an ATM, Sachz is annoying with very poorly executed physical comedy, and the rest of the characters fall into the same as Lightning or is the standard spunky go get 'em character common in many anime stories or annoying white knight nuisances.  I don't really remember any of them fondly or at all and I just played the game, yet I can recall Jade Empire support characters and even Final Fantasy 3/6 sub characters without issue.

The amount of effort they put into the artistic aspect in this game is simply jaw-dropping. This is one of the most beautiful game I have ever played, the graphic designs and music alone are enough incentives for me to finish the whole game (which takes tens of hours).\n\nThe battle system is also the high point of the game which emphasize on pre-battle planning. I was fascinated by the simple yet deep battle system, so I took the time to grind like crazy and grabbed all the achievement post-game. For your reference, it takes at least 100 hours to 100% this game.\n\nPersonally I do not have much problem with a game being linear. Also it will open up in chapter 11 and become semi-open world. The change from linear to semi-open world is a bit overwhelming for me at first, I somehow liked it being linear.\n\nStory is not bad but it feels cheesy at times. I liked the lore and the confusing mythology. Although the English localization/ translation is decent, I am not happy that US version doesnt have Japanese text and subtitles.\n\nOh, I liked Lightening, and those awkward Ane-Shota stiuations with Hope. My only compain on Lightening is that she is way too skinny for an Onee-san type of character, if her body build is more like Fang it will be perfect. Hope is annoying as fuxK for a few chapters, but he gets much better later not unlike a lot of those anime characters.\n\nOn the technical side, this game is a pretty bad port, because of the inconsistent framerate caused by horrible optimization. But at least the framerate never droped below 30 for me on 4k with 2K shadow resolution, and stayed at 60 during cutscene and most of the explorations. So I kinda get used to it. The next port FFXIII-2 has even more severe performance issues.\n\n\nIt is either hate it or like it situation here, it has to do with personal taste. If you like a linear game with beautiful graphic and music, good battle system, do not mind framerate drop too much, after go through a few dull tutorial chapters, it will become a pleasant experience. Considering the price, and the production value of this game, it is not a bad deal, and you can always grab it when it is on sell for a few bucks. However if you are looking for open world experience, choice and consequences, look elsewhere.","April 7, 2015","true","251.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

There are very few options and it doesn't run well. Compared to, say, the Valkyria Chronicles pc port it's embarrassing. Kb/m controls are glitchy. We had to make threads on steam and wait months just to get above 720p resolution and graphical options, which are still very limited. That's how bad a port this is.\n\nNow, the game itself. It looks very good. The cutscenes look amazing, the story is kind of interesting, and, if it's the sort of thing you look for in a game, the female characters are done very well imo, except for Vanille, she's kind of annoying. The battle system takes a while to get the hang of but when you do, it's quite good. Until then, you will be just spamming the A button. The story focuses on a group of unlucky individuals who have been cursed - 'l'cie' (some of the names in this game are silly, and it throws a bunch of nouns at you  immediately which you won't understand) They struggle with their fate - which for me is one of the more interesting parts of the story. A good part of the game is just them coming together as a group, and figuring out their destiny, which makes the dynamic of the group strong and interesting.\n\nThe game is very linear. This wouldn't be a problem if the game wasn't so repetitive. There is nothing to do besides walk forwards, fight, cutscene. The game desperately needed some variation, some more puzzle solving, or something. It's too long, too. Be prepared to walk, battle, cutscene for 100 hours+. There are no towns, and very little people to actually interact with in the world, which makes me question why this is even a game at all, and not a film/tv series/ anime. When the game finally opens up all you get are quests, go here kill this monster, but at this point the thought of doing any more battles felt like such a chore I skipped most of them. The upgrade system is a complete gamble and you end up wasting so much money through being inefficient at what's essentially a guessing game. The crystarium levelling system is a perfect metaphor for the game: looks flashy, but in fact is very linear with few branching paths. I am seriously failing to understand what the logic behind some of these design decisions were, unless they thought 'It's final fantasy, we can do no wrong.' Well, they did wrong. I remember the devs talking about streamlining the game to make it more accessible. Well, that was a bad idea, because nobody who doesn't already play total grindfests will want to spend more than a few hours playing this.\n\nI tried to enjoy this game, I really did. I tried to persevere through the repetition to find out what happens in the end. But it's just too much. They should have made this game 15-20 hours, cut most of the flashy yet ultimately linear and boring levels and told a much tighter, more varied story through more than just the cutscenes. It feels like a bunch of grinding attached to an admittedly very stylish and good looking collection of cut-scenes which tell an interesting story. It's just a shame that the actual game couldn't have been better.","June 30, 2015","false","47.1"," 6 of 9 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","6","9","0","0"

I knew what to expect from FINAL FANTASY® XIII over listening to repeated complaints from a cancerous online gaming community regarding its linearity over the years, but there's always that major gulf in hearing and experiencing. To put it in perspective, FINAL FANTASY® XIII is more linear than Super Mario Brothers ® 3. Infact, to call Super Mario Brothers ® 3 in terms of its representative platforming genre linear is quite the injustice as there are many tactile and descretive choices, plus discoveries a player can make in terms of journey to reach the final stage.\n\nPlaying Final Fantasy ® XIII last night on the other hand I couldn't help but compare the storytelling mechanics to the drearily tacked on singleplayer campaign of Battlefield ® Bad Company 2, infact this is probably Final Fantasy ® XIII's closest cousin. You will be presented by cutscene after cutscene, and during exploration (pressing forward on the controller) your party members will constantly teleport ahead of you and enact out a scripted scene akin to walking past other kids roleplaying in the playground during a typical lunchtime in primary school. The result is quite irksome and distracting, as your primary focus is wrestling with the camera trying to visually locate stray treasure chests (spheres) dotted to the left and right of paths.\n\nLinearity is not so much a bad thing in games that focus on a rich narritive experience, except that Final Fantasy ® XIII repeatedly shows that it is shameless about its stripped game design. This wouldn't be a problem at all if it did offer a half decent narritive experience (or compelling scenario), or less cringeworthy character interactions to begin with. I did not even mention the Crystarium system yet. Its basically how you 'level up' your characters in terms of stat boosting and is an algamation of the acclaimed Sphere Grid (Final Fantasy ® X) and Job Board (Final Fantasy ® XII) counterparts, except that each "Grid" (or Crystal!) is about 12 nodes long, and there is no detriment of choice in which stats or skills to take since you will eventually fill them all in anyway.\n\nCrystarium is a dumb name for Line Grid.\n\nConsole Port-wise, this is the Xbox 360 version except you can choose between Japanese and English voice acting on start up and downscaled 4k 1080p graphics thanks to an unnofficial graphics patch made by GeDeSato (a very talented modder from Neogaf) that appeared SIX HOURS after the official Steam release. So to fully reap the benefits of buying this game for the PC you need to fish around the forums for a patch link.\n\nAll in all, I doubt more than 2 people will read this wall of text this far down.

The gameplay is a little bit to casual, just controlling one character with auto-select attack/spell/etc is a bit surprising and the moment when you have to choose it manually for change really the issue of a battle is too rare.\nSecond, the first half of the game is a "one-way", linear game, this point could be great if the story was as much as great than the previous FF, I think it s one or two degrees down compare to pieces of art like FFVI/VII/VIII/X.\nThird, some characters i could never apreciate because they are too cliche for me. I don't feel that in usual FF; i think mainly to Hope and Vanille. Fortunately, Lightning and Fang are badass as hell.\n\nMany points were excellent, when you reach Gran Pulse, it s the moment the game take is full potential, little "open-wolrd" and many additionnal quests and contents to do that looks like more than a traditional FF.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/kerwyn/recommended/292120/","kerwyn","DIGITAL SPORTS","http://steamcommunity.com/id/kerwyn/","232 products in account","I enjoyed this game, however I can't exactly say it was good. It has every element that makes up a good story driven RPG. The characters, on paper, are compelling. The story, on paper, is interesting. The character development, on paper, is interesting and the combat is really fun. The game is gorgeous and the world, on paper, is interesting.\n\nThe problem is that nearly every element of the game is mishandled from minute one.\n\nThe characters are held back by atrocious dialog and awful voice direction (Although for the most part the voice acting is good).\n\nThe story is held back by awful pacing and a habit of extreme repetition as if the game doesn't trust you to understand it (and keep this idea in mind, the game not trusting its players - I'll get back to that in a bit).\n\nThe character development harkens back to the excellent systems of Final Fantasy 10, then manages to mishandle them in every possible way. It recreates the sphere grid, but with multiple classes per character; however each class is essentially one path with little branching and additional classes aren't unlocked later in the game; this turns the system into effectively grinding for miniscule stat increases between new ability unlocks. Item upgrades are very similar; grinding monster parts or gil to throw xp at them for miniscule stat gains. Again, the game fails to trust the player to make any in-depth decisions with their characters.\n\nCombat, on the other hand, is very interesting and fun. Battles play in typical Final Fantasy fashion of pseudo-turn based with menus, however everything is much faster and the ability to switch classes on the fly (in the middle of a turn even!) makes for some fast paced and entertaining battles.\nAgain, though, there are problems. Final Fantasy 13 seems afraid to give you too many options early: not letting you even customize your party until nearly 15 hours in and limiting you to 2 characters at a time for much of the game, making early battles both less interesting visually and from a tactical standpoint. Not being able to switch character control in combat (your party lead is directly controlled, other members AI controlled) is also a problem, but less of one than it sounds - the AI does a good enough job of picking the right actions (based on your knowledge of the enemy to boot). Combat also becomes very repetative against some of the simpler enemies.\n\nBut now, for the gorilla in the room: This game is linear. It's linear as ♥♥♥♥. The phrase "corridor simulator" comes to mind. Square Enix creates a very interesting and potentially detailed setting, then renders you completely unable to actually explore or interact with it. Even when the game world opens up, you're still very limited in what you can actually do. Almost as if SE couldn't trust the player to figure out what to do if the game was more open.\n\nAnd therein lies the game's largest fault; it doesn't trust the player to be able to do anything on their own. SE doesn't trust you to figure out the story, find your way in the world, figure out the battle system, or develop your characters without leading you on the nose for hours and hours.\n\nIn spite of all of this, I enjoyed the game. Combat is really, legitimately fun 90% of the time; despite all the flak the characters get from fans I enjoyed most of them (I stand by most of the criticism with the characters boiling down to awful dialog and direction); and the story is legitimately interesting until the later chapters (there's a bit of a deus ex machina at the end). I still recognize its faults though; there's bad game design right left and center here.\n\nSome words on the PC port: it ran great, framerate wise. Controlled fine with M+KB and controller. The resolution locking is incredibly stupid but you can at least toss a hack on to set it to whatever you want. The escape key quitting the game is so hilariously stupid I can't even get mad about it; it's just funny. Had some minor FPS drops entering new areas and a crash here and there, but nothing major.\n\nThe pricetag is right on this one. At $16 you could do a lot worse provided you can look past this game's faults. Throwing a recommend here; with the caveat that if you can't see past the game's flaws you should just avoid it.","October 20, 2014","true","52.9"," 14 of 25 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","14","25","0","0"

Locked at 720p, runs like ♥♥♥ on my 870m (and a lot of other Nvidia cards), and it's 50GB. And almost all of that is from the movie files (Japanese and English forced download). There's some fan fixes in the work, one specifically from Durante, but it's pretty rough as of this moment.\n\nNow, as for the game... Awful story, it's pure garbage. Almost ALL of the information you need to follow the story is told to you in the game's codec. You need to read paragraph after paragraph of information as you explore and are given bits at a time. Now you might say. "But Damuel, what about Dark Souls? It doesn't spoon feed you the story and you would be lost without a lot of reading!". Well here's the difference. Final Fantasy gives you practically a NOVELs worth of information, and the game shoves story references down your throat left and right that will leave you absolutely confused without reading. And it's not like there's any thought, it's just that you're basically given a book that you need to have to even remotely follow along.\n\nBut how about the characters? Oh boy, Lightning is my waifu, so pretty. Shame she's an absolute ♥♥♥♥♥ for no reason, and the supporting cast isn't much better. You have Snow, your typical do-gooder, he's absent for a good portion of the game, but he's somewhat likable if perhaps a bit too generic of a "hero" type character. You have Hope, a whiny child who constantly is afraid of things and silently spits on everyone else. You have Vanille, an annoying tween girl who has been overly sexualized both in game and in the stacks of rule 34 online, possibly the most annoying character of all time in FF. Bad VO, bad script, terrible fighter, and just nothing redeeming. The two remaining characters barely have an appearance but they're decent. Sazh is amusing and an alright supporting character but he's barely ever seen. Fang is just super generic strong female character, nothing special.\n\nThe visuals were nice for its time but they're ♥♥♥ now. Everything is super jagged and the animations are stiff. It's not HORRIBLE, but it would have been nice to get some HD textures at least for the PC release. The CGI is nice though.\n\nCombat system is garbage. The only practical way to fight is to use the autobattle, otherwise things take too long. Basically push A/X to win. Shifting is okay but gets VERY tiresome at times. It's basically the game's class system and you need to switch classes constantly mid fight. At times it gets frustrating to switch back and forth between every other attack. Personally I liked the old fashioned turn based fighting of the pre FF12 games.\n\nThe game is SUPER linear. A lot of the FF games are but this one takes it to the next level. The TUTORIAL is over 10 hours long. You can't change your party members (Yes, even if visually you have a crew of 5 people with you, you're forced to play with the three the game wants you to play with) or pick what classes they use until the 'tutorial' is over. What a horrible design choice.\n\nThat all being said... The game IS Final Fantasy. It has pretty CGI, the story is decent if you don't mind a TON of reading, and most of the issues gameplay wise are in comparison to the previous games. It's still a very solid JRPG for 15 bucks, though I wouldn't pay more than 10 these days for it. The game clocks in at around 20-30 hours depending on how much you're willing to grind.\n\nEdit: I guess I should mention, the game gets A LOT better after the 'tutorial'. But it will take most people between 10-20 hours to actually get through it. And that's unacceptable. There's a good game underneath all the garbage, but we shouldn't have to play through for 10 HOURS to get to the fun stuff. The characters are more likable, the game is less linear, there's side content, and you can FINALLY play with the people you want (besides a few fights). It almost turns into a true final fantasy game.","October 10, 2014","false","23.8"," 18 of 33 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","18","33","0","0"

When FF7 was released on PSX, we found characters up against a seemingly herculean enemy. And so it goes up until at least FF13-3. This game is no different and seems as though the story of FF games just keep getting recycled iteration after another. Branded by "gods" known as Fal'Cie, our group of heroes struggle to cope with what it means to be "branded". Apart from the obvious insinuations to humanity and what it means to be a conscious animal, the story unfolds in typical Japanese fashion, where the key to getting out of the existential nihilist framework our heroes have been suddenly thrown into is to courageously fight. And fight they do! Too bad the combat system within which our heroes are controlled is abysmal.\n\nFor starters, this game mirrors FF12 in that characters are given a set of behavior conditions and the AI acts them out. This game, unfortunately, has truncated that concept and instead of "conditions", characters now have "roles" and customization comes in the form of paradigms where the user gets to mix and match roles and instead of setting the conditions upon which certain behavior is expressed, the best action is chosen by the AI. Sometimes that doesn't really work out too well. As an example, I was fighting a boss and had set a paradigm with a "saboteur". The role sounds exactly like the name; de-buffing enemies. My brilliant character, however, when faced with an enemy with 4 buffs, including haste, took it upon herself to continue to cast "slow" instead of "dispel". Casting slow will not actually slow the enemy in this game, it will remove haste. Slow will need to be caste twice, in that particular situation, to actually slow the character. Here's the problem: dispel has a 100% success rate, while "slow" on the other has a base success rate of 30%. The omniscient AI chose to caste slow TWICE instead of just casting dispel. I have no word (beyond the ones I've just used of course).\n\nAnother absolute blunder is the stipulation that whenever a user controlled character (the leader) dies, the game is over, even though other characters have the ability to revive dead characters. I don't mind the artificial difficulty this addition brings if it were implemented a little better, but unfortunately, as the game progress and the user is faced with stronger and smarter enemies (oh yes, enemies can and will "coordinate attacks against a single person"), success starts to hinge more and more on luck until battles start dropping more points with which to level up. So there's a period of about 18 hours (or the first 10 chapters) where success is based on luck because enemies will attack a user controlled character and kill that person. A single enemy has the potential to deal 50% damage in one attack string, so 2 enemies can KO a character within 10 seconds of the start of a battle. Huh? Further, when one is trying to heal, in those clutch situation where actual seconds can work against you, characters take the time to turn and face the character they want to cast a spell on before actually casting the spell even though every spell in the game has homing properties. Oh my jesus.\n\nThis actually takes a few seconds to complete because characters who aren't physically offensive will stay behind all other characters. Which brings up mobility. Characters move around the battlefield on their own and sometimes walk into AOE spells that they would normally be out of range for if they just stopped moving. Some enemies will cast spells on characters in the back row but if no command is input by the user, the "leader" will just start to walk backwards. What? The ATB also hilariously stops when the character is grounded (collapses or is collapsed to the floor). It's an active tme battle, why does it stop?\n\nAnother wonderful addition is the characters themselves. The voice acting is atrocious. The character development is hilarious and the causes and conditions that would seem to cause character introspection actually do the reverse. Moral certainty is questioned not when a slew of people start dying around this one specific character, but when one little boy questions the intentions of his actions. Are you serious? Part of the reason this game fails so miserably at being an RPG is because none of the characters are relatable. I couldn't find a single character to relate to expect in a few instances where the story stopped being a children’s bedtime story and got "real". These characters are killing so many people and animals that they don't even stop to reflect. Independent of whether or not it was in self-defense, they have done things which one could define as "traumatic", yet they continue on as if nothing actually occurred, until, suddenly, they can't continue because "it caught up with them". The story doesn't really explain why or how because we aren't told what's going in the character's head. One stage a character is fine, then, suddenly, the character isn't but nothing in the external environment has changed. Ok, so what happened? RPG's are about story, so tell us the story.\n\nAside from all that, this is still an RPG with lots of side missions (that occur towards the end of the game) and one can still have fun. For me, I had to let go of the idea that this was a game released by a company that used to be much beloved who came up with a much beloved series. This is just an RPG game that will kill some time as newer games are released and it works as such. In that regard, the game is fine as a distraction, but nothing more. As a FF game, and a game with any kind of depth, it sucks.","October 15, 2014","false","137.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/bilibala/recommended/292120/","bilibala","Bilibala","http://steamcommunity.com/id/bilibala/","359 products in account","Okay. This is DISAPPOINTING. First off, this is totally a LAME port over to PC with unfriendly settings down to the very crucial aspect of all: Graphic options. Just when you thought you have a fancy graphics card to show off and tweak about the settings for it, you can't actually find in anywhere of the game for setting up any freaking 3D performance option.\n\nWorst still, i am using an older graphic card with smaller monitor resolution of 1440x900 (AMD RADEON HD6670), the game appear horrendously surrounded with BIG black borders (in FULL mode). Thus, making the viewable window 50% smaller. Though you are getting niffty graphics as such, but what's the point of showing it in a smaller viewable area with HUGE black border around it? And the fact is, you CAN'T change the bloody resolution to fix this! How cruel is that?\n\nWell, putting that aside, there's another BIG problem: Pressing ESC quits the game. Period. Yea. not even a single notification asking you whether is it a confirmed exit? At a point when i was happily into the game and I accidentally pressed ESC thinking that i was jumping out of the menu selection, it totally quited the game for god sake! There goes my game progress! Good job Square Enix for ruining my Final Fantasy moment in PC. This is supposed to be a PC friendly game (that's the point of having a FF in PC rite?) and not just a lame copy-paste port over rite? How could such a big fault in user experience be 'thoughfully' implemented?\n\nApart from that, an even most annoying problem is that, you can't change the voiceover of the game. Yes. It's stuck with Japanese. And the point is, if you didnt turn ON the subtitle, you can't even understand a bit of what they are saying!  Couldn't you make our life easier just by doing great ENGLISH voiceover like what you did with other Final Fantasy port over?!\n\nWell, it's a BIG letdown and I can't even start my game with such horrendous first impression. Totally SPOILT my appetite to continue.  To Square Enix, please get it right before you rush it out to the market, it will definitely turn ppl away. I am one of them.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichillum/recommended/292120/","ichillum","iChillum","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ichillum/","433 products in account","Summary:\nThere is a lot to love, and a lot to dislike about this game depending on what type of person you are.  For those that have been entrenched in the Final Fantasy universe for the past few decades will find glimmering pieces of storytelling and art direction that will get you excited and surprise you with something modern that still gives nostalgia.  For those of you looking for a new RPG experience, and have no experience with Final Fantasy, the game itself will have to be redeeming to you and may only cater to a particular audience.  I see many people argue that the plot "makes no sense", but I would argue the game rather has a hard time establishing relationships with the characters during the first 4-8 HRs of the game, and otherwise it is a wonderfully crafted story.  The problem I believe lies in the fact that the characters themselves are discovering the plot as it unfolds to you.  So there is a certain air of ambiguity as you start the story.  Stick to it, and discover with the characters.  Overall I say this is a title to pickup if you haven't played it before.\n\nPros:\n-The art direction of this game is absolutely exquisite.  While we continue to race toward more pixels, AA and hardware to handle the continually complex environments, this team shows that amazing artists can bypass technology.  Consider that this game was originally released in the US December 2009, and how the graphics can still stand-up to several titles being released today.\n-Fast-paced and fun combat system.  While I could easily argue that the system could have been slightly more complex (which they continued toward with the next installment, Final Fantasy XIII-2), it gives you a sense of not only turn-based RPGs, but arcade button mashing.  Grinding mobs in any RPG can be one of the lowest IQ activities you can experience, but the pace of battle keeps you involved and can take out the "grind".\n-The progression system, Crystarium, was unique and interesting.  I'll also be placing this in the cons category so I can elaborate what would make it better, but the ability for all characters toward game completion allows for all roles (jobs, classes, various other names in other games) to be played which gives you interesting combinations to experiment with.\n-I personally enjoyed the story, and have found each time I played the game that my interest in a particular individual would grow with the story.  The writing pushes you to make assumptions about the character, while the tale is yet unfolding.  I will be forward in saying that they could have done a better job during the first 4-8 HRs of character progression, but even then I don't think it would be a complete re-write.\n-Just like most Final Fantasy games, the musical score was inspired.  It was very different than previous installments, but great.\n\n\nCons:\n-The game in entirety is nearly completely linear.  That can be scathing for a lot of folks being that sandbox RPGs are king for consumers right now.  It will take you anywhere between 18-21 HRs to finally reach "Gran Pulse", an area which has an open map and various quests/objectives to complete.  Paths deviate every once in a while, but otherwise it is a heavily story driven game with singular paths.\n-The ability progression system (Crystarium) again is unique and interesting, but it does almost give you a sense of choice when there is not.  It will finally open up more so at about the 15HR mark during the game, but up until that point you are basically given choices which are superficial and don't make too large of a difference.\n-While I rave about the story, it isn't groundbreaking...and I fear would appeal further to specific audiences.  Being someone who adores Japanese culture, and always loves a rousing tale of good versus evil in various fashions, this is up my alley.  If what I described isn't for you, then you are probably reading this in the "Cons" portion for a good reason.\n-The ending feels slightly rushed.  And this may be due to the fact that the game doesn't really open up for you until the 20HR mark.\n\nOther Notes:\nI did not place this in either category, however many are aware of the custom video setting issues that were present upon release of the PC port.  And by issues, I mean that they were non-existent.  Luckily they saw the error of their ways, and quickly released a patch that allowed for all manner of advanced settings.","January 23, 2015","true","26.8"," 4 of 6 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","4","6","0","0"

Now I'm a huge Final Fantasy fan and this game is in fact one of my favorite Final Fantasy games.  I enjoy the gameplay, the story line, and the general feel of the game.  I remember first playing it on the 360 and hearing about the game coming to Steam gave me happy joy joy feelings.  However, I have to say that I am dissapointed in the PC port of Final Fantasy XIII.\n\nI pre-ordered the game and had high expectations that it would be smooth and joyous how I had originally remembered it.  The PC port suffers from low frame rate, micro-stuttering and 720p. Now the 720p doesn't make a big difference when it comes to this game.  I'm playing Final Fantasy XIII to play the game, not to gush at 1080p graphics (1080p would have been nice though).  However, it's the framerate and micro-stuttering that irritates me.\n\nImmediately after popping the game in and beginning through the intro I had issues with the framerate and a stutter that the game was generating.  I have played a multitude of games that did not have this same issue, that pushed the processor hard and did not generate this same stutter.  The micro-stutter is very annoying and is probably the only reason I would give the game a negative review.  Another missing feature is the ability to change resolution, and the Esc. key will automatically close out the game if your playing in full screen.\n\nIt's still the same game.  It's still my beloved Final Fantasy, but until Square corrects the micro-stutter issue I cannot give this game a positive review.  That issue alone impacts gameplay too much.  I'm flat out dissapointed in Square for not properly preparing a port before release.  I sincerely hope that the fans (us) are still special enough to recieve their attention and the issue being corrected.\n\n","October 10, 2014","false","66.9"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/strig9/recommended/292120/","strig9","Strig","http://steamcommunity.com/id/strig9/","348 products in account","First off, let me start by saying I have no experence with the console ports of this game. That being said, this game is VERY poorly optimized for PCs. Even on my Higher-end PC (i7-5930k, 16 gb ddr4, nvidia gtx 770) I can barely keep this game at a consistant 60 FPS, and that is excusing all the times it would drop BELOW 20 near the end game sections. The most stable way I found to play this game was to go into the Nvidia control pannel and enable tripple buffering, but it would still have issues. All of this asside, Let's get into the actual aspects of the game.\n\nBeing a fan of JRPGS, this was one of those games my friends would always tell me I need to try. For many years I thought this game would be utter garbage because of all the hate it had recieved, but my friends assured me it was an awesome game. So as soon as I saw it was getting a PC release, I thought now would be a good time to go ahead and give it a try. Was this game as good as i've been told?\n\nMy first impressions of this game were very mixed, the combat was super easy and required no skill and the game felt like it was just guiding me down one long hallway for hours, and hours. And that is where we see the first problem with this game. Right off the bat this game treats you like you're an unintelligent player who has never played a rpg. Do you get the freedom to explore? no. Do you get to custumize you're skills for what YOU want to be? nope. Insted, you're guided and told what to do to the point where it really feels like you're not doing anything at all. Because of this, it took me a very long time to even get past the first 10 chapters of the game. But my friends kept assuring me to keep playing. After forcing myself to keep going and playing even when I found NO FUN in it what-so-ever, the game finally took me off my leash. Chapter 11 and on is where this game really shines, and let me tell you, it shines bright. The combat get's fleshed out and requires you to not just keep pressing A until the enemy is dead. Now you actually have to start making the correct decks in order to win and know when to switch to them. Chapter 11 should have been the whole game. Hell, Chapter 11-on is long enough to be a game on it's own (It'll take you around 15 hours if you want to just blow through it), But it's not. Insted, they put a 20 hour long TUTORIAL (if anyone argues and says its anything more, you're just wrong). People who argue and say the first ten chapters are to really get you into the story are wrong. The story is so simply for the most part that they could have easily fit it into 3 or 4 chapters and the players would not be as burned out before you get to grand pulse (chapter 11). And that's another thing, the story is a little too simple for my taste, towards the end I did have a little bit of the feels for some of them, but for the most part, I wasn't really engaged. The reason the game is so good in chapter 11 is it turns in to a tradition RPG, but with just the right amount of a modern twist filled with side-quests, exploration, and customizable battle mechanics. You gain the freedom to do what you want and only move on when you feel you want to continue. The combat feels really fluid and engaging. Because of the set up of the mechanics, the combat feels more energetic and exciting. it's a really unique experence that you just need to try for yourself.\n\nJust to wrap up, The game wasn't BAD, it just has some MAJOR problems in it's design that REALLY hold it back. I know for a fact that thes flaws are the reason so many people gave up on the game and just auto-matically brushed it off as a bad game. I've heard 13-2 fixed a lot of the issues and i'm looking forward to play through it.\n\nNow if I could only rate the game based on chapter 11 and on, I would give it a 9/10\nBut as a whole, it's nothing better than a 6/10\nPlay this game if you have the patients to get through 10 chapters (20 hours) of mediocre gameplay to get to the amazingly sweet end game (15-20 hours). It's kind of like a Tootsie-Pop.","February 2, 2015","true","47.5"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","1"

Sadly, this doesn't happen. Final Fantasy XIII is a joke. It sits at an unchanging 1280x720 resolution and is capped to 60FPS.\n\nThere are no video options outside of "Fullscreen or Windowed", and the controls are not only touchy but unusable on the keyboard as well.  Performance also seems to have some really strange quirks involved as any reading or writing to disk instantly causes pre-rendered scenes to stutter, though they seem to be sped up to keep up with the 60FPS target. In-game, performance stutters pretty badly, even in combat which is pretty absurd.\n\nAesthetically the game does okay, but considering that my monitor is 2560x1440, having it limited to less than half of the available resolution when other recent games not only look great but perform great at that above-1080 standard, it's disheartening to see this kind of result.\n\n50GB to download and install, locked to 1280x720 at 60FPS with strange side effects, dodgey keyboard and mouse input, already on top of a story that I want to finish but feel less than thrilled about in the first place.\n\nAt least it's cheap?","October 10, 2014","false","3.2"," 6 of 10 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","6","10","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/regaltv/recommended/292120/","regaltv","Big Buff","http://steamcommunity.com/id/regaltv/","443 products in account","Here's something you have to realize about this game: Yes, it sparked debate and controversy and a fair bit of backlash from fans. Now, most of this was warranted, yes. Nomura and Square Enix took some risks with Final Fantasy XIII and some were better recieved than others. For example, Linearity. The linear nature of this game was the cause of a lotof backlash. And, frankly, it  is  really linear. In fact, a fair bit of the first twelve chapters will be spent walking down a pretty, dressed up corridor. That's undeniable. Once you get to Gran Pulse, however, the game world really opens up, and it becomes much better in that respect. Another source of backlash was a mediocre story and shallow, unlikeable characters. This isn't easily fixed, was never fixed, and returning characters continued to be unlikeable throughout the FFXIII series (which in itself was another issue.)\n\nBut  there is also a lot to love about this game. For one, the Paradigm Battle System is one of my personal favorite battle systems of all time. It's fast, fluid, and the range of Paradigms makes combat feel fresh each time. Keep in mind that this system didn't really shine in the grindier fights or the standard enemy fights. This sytem  really  shined during the big boss battles. Another great thing about this game was the music. Christ, the music of FFXIII is some of the best in the series, if not in all of gaming. Nobuo Uematsu knows how to make music and certainly knows how to convey emotion through his orchestra. And, I mean, c'mon. Sazh. How could you not love Sazh. Plus, this game's environments, while restrictive, were (and still are) absolutely stunning. This is a very pretty game, even six years later.  Can't wait for the 1080p patch or inevitable mod.\n\nOne last high note is the lack of port issues, at least as far as I've gotten, which is only to the Pulse fal'Cie. Unlike previous ports, this one seems to have no issues, aside from the inability to play in fullscreen, though that could be an issue on my end. In all, while this game has some flaws, and has been exaggerated as one of the worst Final Fantasy games of all time, it still deserves your time and money, because despite what some say, it's a brilliant game.","October 17, 2014","true","12.7"," 7 of 12 people (58%) found this review helpful","58","7","12","0","0"

The combat, repetitive at it is, was actually fun and the story was interesting. But then things went wrong somehow.\nSo, I came to this point of the game where I'm being repeatedly throw into fights with annoying and unforgiving enemies. Literally, I was fighting like 6 enemies at the same time and, as much as I like to win, winning these fights just makes me wonder if I should be doing something else with my time.\nThen the story... Jesus Christ, this game actually had an interesting story. Then, it seems like the writers decided to start making no sense at all. I mean, I can forgive a bad story if the gameplay is really good. Unfortunately, FFXIII fails to deliver. I only bought this to actually promote more Final Fantasy games in the PC but if this trend of FF games continue to come out, I'll have to say goodbye to this franchise. This is not a good Final Fantasy game. Hell, this is not even a good game at all.\nI'll just finish this game (or at least try to) to make myself feel that I got my money's worth back.

I cannot see what anyone would possibly see in such a terrible game... I have various reasons for disliking it, cheif among them that I am a Final Fantasy fan since NES and this is just simply put, a boring game.\n\nAlthough I've only played a bit of this game I can say simply that there is very little to offer here. The battle system is rediculously boring. You can get by the entire game just pushing X. You have control over only one of your character in the party as well which takes away from the game. Your "members" in the party are basically NPC's that add AI support. If you just choose the "auto-battle" option it will generally apply the skill or ability best suited to the situation and layout of enemies. That is like doing someones homework for them. Sure its easy and quick but you won't get a damn thing out of it. I prefer a game where you actually have to think for yourself...\n\nAlso, the dialog is very very poorly written. For example, in the beginning of the game, Snow Villiers gets support from some citizens that want to help fight. They don't want to sit back and do nothing, alright, I get that. But there is a mother who gets up to recieve a gun and fight, and when she does her son says, "Mom, wait!" and all she says is that it will be ok. And when she gets her gun all she says is moms are tough and gives her son an unconcerned look.... what parent, knowing they might die or live doesnt so much as say goodbye to their kid? It completely took away from the impact of her death later because of how poorly written that entire scene was. Like... normally stuff like that would get me choked up, like in Mass Effect 3 when Shepard sees a transport carrying a kid she failed to save explode. That actually made me cry because of how it was written, it makes a big difference.\n\nAlso, this game is so poorly compressed it's a joke. Just shy of 60 gigs is a rediculous amount for an MMORPG, why the hell is a 1p game that large? Coming from someone who plays only PC games, this title is not pretty enough to warrent such a large game file. Why is it so big? *shrug*\n\nThe only thing I can say that countradicts the bad things I've heard about this game is that the story really isnt as confusing to me as it seems to have been for many people... and I barely got through the beginning of the game. The premise reminded me of a FF7 rip off the way the world was made. And the fact that Lightning is an ex-"soldier" who appears to be against the government now.\n\nIf you are planning to buy this game, DON'T! It isa waste of money for a boring, easy game with terrible writting. I didn't get into the game long enough to really get into any of the characters either, but I can say they are all very unimpresive. None but the black man witha chocobo in his fro even stand out in my mind... and I hated that character. I hope this prevents someone from wasting their time with this FF. It's sad but Final Fantasy is all but dead in my opinion. It seems that ever since they changed from square soft to square enix, they have just been failing in the game market.","February 9, 2015","false","1.9"," 8 of 14 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","8","14","0","9"

The audio also skips every now and then, mostly during visually intense sequences. Further tweaking would be for naught, as the tweaks I've made had little to no influence on the game's performance. I'm not the only one experiencing such issues either--plenty of people with much more powerful hardware are experiencing similar problems. As such, I can confidently attribute this game's erratic performance to poor optimization on the part of Square-Enix.\n\nIn it's current state, I cannot recommend the PC version of Final Fantasy XIII. While it's perfectly playable (controls are decent on either joypad or keyboard and mouse, despite their respective lack of rumble and sensitivity settings; it's also more fun than the naysayers will have you believe), it's full of audio/visual stuttering, takes up a massive amount of hard drive space, and is locked to 720p by default.

Along with the low price, it's a great purchase.\n\nHere's to hoping future games in this series won't suffer from bad porting decisions.","November 15, 2014","true","35.2"," 9 of 16 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","9","16","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/recommended/292120/","astring","every bae is halloween","http://steamcommunity.com/id/astring/","4251 products in account","Here is the problem with this game: it is not nearly the ♥♥♥♥♥how you may have heard, but it is still busted on every damn level, and there is no reason to play it when its sequels improve on its flaws massively. That's it. That's the short review: skip to XIII-2 and never look back, the story doesn't mean a damn. If you absolutely, positively must catch up prior to XIII-2, watch the video Square released prior to Lightning Returns that summed up the entire plot to date in a 16-bit style in about 6 minutes. It's more coherent than this entire game.\n\nAlright, let's just break this down some, because that deserves explanation.\n\nThe battle engine is DECENT, but you're going to be stuck with a highly-gimped version of the combat system for HALF THE GAME. I mean, I know the early chapters are shorter than the later ones? But you don't unlock "everyone has all their job roles" (and no, this isn't FFV-style jobs, it's "you fit into this style of skill when in that class", no variance, no ability carryover, only stat gains) until CHAPTER TEN OF THIRTEEN. Even with my lopsided playtime, that's still over a third through the game before you can finally use all of its functions.\n\nThe port's got issues. I just upgraded this machine under half a year ago from scratch, a solid setup, and even then there's still weird frame chugging. God willing they'll patch that up some when Lightning Returns drops (there was an engine update on XIII-2's release that was... questionably helpful), but expect hitching. More than a few areas still look gorgeous, though, props there.\n\nYes, it is about as linear as you've heard. There is basically a single chunk of game where you aren't on one-way-briefly-branching paths, and that one is just a huge open field, which is a middle-finger in that there's kiiiiiind of fast-travel, but you have to complete a sidequest to open each point. And go to one of them to warp to the others. And you can only hold one sidequest at once. So it's miserable to get around is what I'm saying. I guess there's post-game stuff to do there too, but heck if I really want to do more of this for completion's sake now that I'm done when I have XIII-2 in my library to actually enjoy.\n\nFinally, there's the story. This story is hot trash. The finale is unquestionably one of the dumbest things I've ever seen in JRPGs, and I want you to really, really ponder what that implies. It's not even funny dumb, either, because I'd be marking this as a positive if so. It's "none of this makes any sense and it's all random BS at this point". The tale goes that this game's development was such a trainwreck that all the cutscenes were done far before the game, meaning that rather than scrap those scenes, they had to write around already-animated footage? I can believe it. Characters "die" only to reappear an hour later nonsensically, people flip personalities on a dime all the way to endgame, and I still can't quite understand what the relationship between a few characters was because it's ENTIRELY ALIEN AND UNIQUE TO EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE GAME.\n\nI am literally telling you to skip this and play its sequels if you want anything to do with this story, and you will be better off for it. 100% sincere here. The soundtrack is decent (and I mean DECENT, not amazing or anything), and that's about the best praise I can give this that doesn't have the qualifier "...but the sequels did it better so you don't need to stick your hand into the rough edges of this title".","January 23, 2015","false","22.6"," 11 of 20 people (55%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","55","11","20","0","3"

Yes, you read that right, I'm a big fan, but I'm not recommending the game. I've played around 100 hours on PS3, and I've reached Gran Pulse at the time of this review, and have spent about 20 hours on this version at the time of writing.\n\nThe combat system is fast-paced and cinematic, and requires good strategy to do well. I've never been a person for story, so I can't comment on that. The game is a good length for the price you pay.\n\nHowever...\n\nThis game is quite possibly the worst port I have ever played.\n\nLet me mention all the problems that come to mind right now:\n\n-Locked to 720p\n-Awful framerates, despite me having far higher specifications than recommended.\n-Pressing ESC immediately forcequits the game without a prompt. (There is a prompt if you're playing windowed)\n-Absolutely no graphical options at all.\n-You're forced to download the Japanese voices, whether you want to use them or not. This adds a lot to the size of the game and makes it take far longer to download than it should.\n-Graphical glitches in cutscenes: In one cutscene, Vanille's hair didn't render at all, and Sazh was invisible. Odin completely failed to render in the Eidolon fight, too. I was fighting against an invisible Odin.\n-The HUD is the most framerate intensive part of the game. When I disabled it, my framerate shot up. Unfortunately, playing battles without the HUD is kinda....impossible.\n\n...That's all I can think of right now. I think the game is great, but it is definitely not worth the asking price right now for how awful a port it is. Wait until Square fixes the port. (I really hope they're actually going to try fix this...thing).\n\nIf you must play the game, I highly recommend you go check out Durante's fix with GeDoSaTo. It fixes the resolution issue, at the very least. None of the other framerate fixes have made a difference to me, so I can't recommend any of those.\n\nNow, if you'll excuse me, I'll go back to playing this awful port. Or maybe I won't. I really don't have any desire to play at 15 FPS anymore.","October 12, 2014","false","32.6"," 21 of 40 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","21","40","0","4"

As this is my first Final fantasy game, I was really thrilled and astounded with its beginning. This game has really nice and impresive visuals, glamorous world and developed characters. I have really enjoyed about the first 40 hours of a gameplay stuck deep with it. To this point everything perfect for me. Quite a lot of people wrote a negative reviews about the engine performance, which haven't occured when i played (stuttering, lagging, crashes, unresponsive controller and such) - everything worked nicely on my 3 years old notebook (2.3 Ghz, Radeon HD 5650 1GB, 4GB ram - using XBOX 360 controller) on 108p0. I have felt some framerate drops during really graphicaly challenging sceenes with many spells blazing, but still most of a time really playable with decent FPS (30-40 FPS -> Yeah it is not that trendy 60FPS, but still really good,ey? :D)\n\nBut after those cca 40 hours came a big downside of a game. Massively repetetive fighs, same enemies started to bore me a lot. A LOT...There i decided I really dont want to strive for all achievments (what would take about another 40 hours of repetetive grinding) and rushed to a finish....That is quite sad, because it quite ruined the game for me after that nice time i have spent with it. The last 2 hours were really teeth grinding and needed full will to not trash the game and finished after i have spent so much time with it. + Outro is really great :D\n\nSo at the end it was 50/50 between recomendiing this game or not, but still i have enjoyed longer time than i didn't, so after a long decision I recommend the game....I think many people will really like it but my tip is : Dont grind too much (as it is not really needed (I have easily finised with my Specs and Equip in middle level (LVL 2 items-some not fully upgraded and crystalarium in about lvl 8), with only 3 hours of pure grind (and even there i was slopy :D) and enjoy the game as a story takes you or you may get in similiar situation of bored gamer and that might ruin your game.\n\nSTORY: 8/10 - Story is great, but some strange twist and the prolonging (for boredom to me) sometimes strikes it down. Still, in a basics I have enjoyed the storytelling.\nGraphics : 10/10 - Nice for 3 years console port and the settings, artworks and such is realy beautifull\nSOUND : 6/10 - There are some nice pieces but i found some soundtrack tittles really out of the place for a given situation. Also the sounds used in fights are quite similiar to each other and after a few hours of listening to them over and over again they got quite annoying.\nGAMEPLAY: 3/10 : Quite a lot said in a review...inovative (for me as a newbie in JRPG) at first, really borring and headbashing after some time. Of course you can swich to different charracters, change the style but at the end, it is still the same over and over again.\n\nTOTAL 6/10","January 7, 2015","true","61.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Pretty damn good graphics overall.\n2. Brilliant and engaging battle system. A little complex too.\n3. Interesting story, with quite a few backstory-style datalog entries to read.\n3a. The Soundtrack! The best video game soundtrack I've heard in a long while. Simply fan dabby dosie.\n4. Controller support. I like using Mouse and Keyboard, but not with this. Too... clunky. Controller doesn't take away from the experience, so why not? It only makes it better!\n\nBad Bits:\n1. My god the frame drops. My computer, without sounding too flashy, can run this game on max shadow resolution (8192x8192), so it begs the question: Why can't it maintain 60fps? It only drops to 30, nothing less. It just noticeable.\n2. Around 15 hours of total linearity. Which in my eyes is okay, due to the game being able to hold my attention for that period of time. Now, around 13 hours of my playtime after this has been non-linear, but involved alot of farming. Alot. A word of warning.\n3. 30gb+ install. My god. If you're where I am, where your internet runs off a pizza box and is 1.2mbp/s (0.12MB/s), then good luck downloading the game. If you're anywhere else, you should be fine.\n\nOverall. 8.5/10. Pretty fantastic, with great visuals, an engaging story with pretty damn badass characters. Except one.\nWould recommend.\n\nEdit: Okay, solved the FPS drops. It's because for some reason the game hates CPU's with more than 4 cores. So, you have to run it on 4 or less. So, I've changed the rating in lieu of the port being unoptimised. Easy fix though, so not a hefty decrease.","January 9, 2015","true","120.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game takes a while to reach its stride, the true battle system isn't unlocked until Chapter 3, and up until that point, battles are pointless and albeit a bit tedious. And like classic JRPGs, you're in for a lot of cutscenes.\n\nIf you're not a fan of JRPGs or if this is going to be your first, I honestly wouldn't recommend this game to start unless you're a stickler for storylines and character development (I know I am so perhaps I'm a bit biased here).

The game is extremly linear, but that is common in more modern RPGs. The story however is epic. It is one of the best stories of a Final Fantasy game since FFVII. They did change the way battles are done, to real time from turn based which is a mixed bag in my eyes. It is a different element, but it has down sides also. One is that you have a main hero, who if dies you who team dies. I also feel this game made Eidolons kinda worthless, which is one of the main aspects of the game and me main gripe.\n\nPros:\n-Beautiful story\n-Beautiful Graphics\n-Interesting characters as usual\n-Real time battles make the game feel fresh and more fast paced.\n-Decent length story, much longer if you do all the optional missions.\n\nCons:\n-Eidolons feel like they have less purpose as I can beat the game using them only once or twice often not even using them on main bosses.\n-Real time battles can be frustrating and harder to use tact and you have less control over the characters and only control the role of them in predesignated paradigms. The only character which you have specific control over is your party leader (which is hard give specific commands as the battle is real time)\n- Unlike in games like FFVII if your party leader dies you lose the battle. Whereas in other FF gams I have played if the party leader died you could ressurect him/her.\n-very linear\n-instead of finding your ultimate weapon you "craft" it. This was painstakingly LONG and rediculous.\n-You can "upgrade weapons" also, which is odd since your old weapons can literally be made better than end game weapons powerwise. In a way it feels more like the weapons are less about dmg, than their abilities.\n\nAll in all I like the series, but it has many pluses and minuses. Most of the minuses are either things I have gotten used to with other modern RPGs doing the same or they are outweighed by the pluses.

Too linear, undeveloped character, confusing storytelling, etc. One can argue that the game gets better after the first 20 hr. However, a game that needs 20 hrs to start being pleasant is a bad game.\n\nNow, at 2016, after playing this game again I have change my mind. This is a solid entry in the series with a deep combat system (maybe the best one ever?).\n\nMy advise is not spending a lot of time battling in the beginning. Just move forward with the history and you will probably enjoy this game. It is still a linear experience, however if you focus on enjoying the history instead of battling over and over again the characters will grow on you. Also, the enemies within the first chapters of the game almost doesn't give you XP and this is another reason to avoid these battles.","March 21","true","6.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I do have a wired xbox 360 controller, but the port is weird: my computer detects and uses it fine, until I start final fantasy, after which my computer miraculously doesn't recognize the xbox controller anymore to the point where i couldn't use it anymore. Maybe the latter is a problem with my own computer, I don't know.\n\nFor the cons:\n- the game is supremely linear, I mean every final fantasy game is linear, but for instance in FFX or FFXII you had this open world kind of thing where you moved around and went as you please. In here it's a map, you never really decide where you're going, you're just following and moving forward on one street. At least it's like that from the point where I'm at, haven't finished the game yet. I really miss being able to walk inbetween mountains and explore a little bit before eventually moving to the next checkpoint, whereas in here you really... can't exactly go anywhere else other than where you're supposed to.\n- I dislike the weapons upgrading system. Once you've upgraded a weapon, you can't see the base stats, making a comparison between your current lv15 weapon and a newly found lvl1 weapon a little weird. Basically I didn't know wtf to spend my resources on without googling it.\n\n\nOther than that:\n\nGreat game, good story, not as mind♥♥♥♥ing as FFX for instance but still with enough gaps to keep you interested. Combat is actually rather nice, although the battles last pretty long. The characters are, as far as I can tell, pretty likeable  and 'natural' in all. Giving it a recommend, although it is by far not one of the best FFs out there.","August 30, 2015","true","28.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Not at all.\nWhilst the original port was somewhat shoddy, it has been hugely improved and is a very pleasant experience.\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII is a curious game. For the first 30+ hours, you are railroaded along with minimal input, occasional fights (auto attack) and a LOT of FMV.\nThe storyline is a little confusing and even non-sensical (I honestly think its the absolute worst FF storyline, ever, having played everything since 3) but I love the character development.\nForget the l'Cie, forget the Fal'Cie, forget the never ending fight between Cocoon and Gran Pulse, listen to Lightning, Vanille, Fang, Sazh, even Snow and Hope as they grow and realise that the world is a much bigger place than they thought it was and that their own problems are really quite petty in the grand scheme.\nAuto Attack really does kill off the majority of fighting, but the paradigm system shines when the going gets tough, being able to switch in healers, buffers and debuffers and swap melee / ranged classes as required was a masterstroke of design, its the single biggest inovation in the FF franchise in a long time, so much so I found the 6 variation limit too... limiting.\nThe side quests (Ci'eth Stone missions and Choco treasure hunting) do offer some variation, but even when on Gran Pulse, there is quite limited freedom and whilst quite large, there are too many tunnels.\nFinishing the game isnt terribly hard, but if you want to level your main teams weapons up, finish the Ci'eth Stones / Titan Missions, then you are going to have to farm a fair bit as you are fairly starved for gil unless you focus on earning it.\n\nOverall, a good port of a somewhat different Final Fantasy game that has garnered a lot of love and hate over the years.","April 2","true","93.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

However, let me explain why I bought it twice! (PC and Xbox 360) Refer to the rating/ Pros and cons to know why\n\nFirst, I would love to specify that it was not a Steam Gift, gifted by a friend or something, I made the purchase at full price. On thus lets go!\n\nI do not mind the Battle System as much as other people! In fact I believe it is quite a challenge to understand at first but then once you get the hang of it, you can play it really strategic.\n\nThe game's progression is chapter-based and in most chapters, the player will see the story through different characters' view. Players can move around the field map while controlling the party leader, the other members moving independently, sometimes running ahead, engaging in dialogue, or stopping to look at objects on the field and pointing things of interest out to the party leader. Other party members being far away from the leader does not affect their participation in battles that take place in a separate module. Players can jump, but only at specific jump spots marked on the map.\n\nEnemies will appear on the map and battles initiate when coming into contact with them. Treasure chests cannot be opened in close proximity to a monster, and there are several instances enemies are "guarding" treasures and must be banished to collect the loot. Shrouds can be used to move about the field without triggering enemy encounters, and to bestow the party with buffs prior to the battle's start.\n\n\nPros Beautiful Visuals, including a variety of open world maps and areas to explore for hours\nChocobos, obviously\nStrategic battle system including sort of classes\nAmazing Story telling, easy to fall in love with each and every details of it. (Exclude characters)\nCons Hard to feeling attached to the characters during the first entry of the game\nThe skills and stats unlock/system is a tiny bit too simple\nNot enough chocobos\nIt is the first game of a trilogy.\n\n\n\nRating        Rate/10                Visuals        9/10                Playability        9/10                Story        8/10                Characters        5/10\n\n\nWould I recommend this game? The answer is Yes!\nHowever, make sure you have a good 40 hours(If you skip a lot of stuff) to spend.","December 23, 2015","true","7.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can comment on one issue I had and that was the controls stopped responding to my commands after a few hours of playing. I wouldn't be able to ALT+TAB out of the game and sometimes I would have to rely on it to get my controls back, at which point they would continually scroll through menu options making selection a timing-based thing. This was particularly horrible during battles and swapping paradigms. Since the game has been out for a long time I will be brief in my review.\n\nPros:\n+ Good English Voice Acting - I didn't know you could play it in Japanese, but I don't particularly want to hear a Japanese guy voice a black guy.\n+ Good Music - I owned the soundtrack before owning the game, so I played a vast majority of the game in silent minus the cutscenes.\n+ The Paradigm System - Once you can unlock swapping team members, the possibilities for battle styles becomes interesting and a lot of fun.\n+ The Crystarium - The game, as a JRPG, is obviously going to be grindy in a way and the Cyrstarium makes you feel like you're getting results from mindless battles.\n+ Rendered Cutscenes, and Character Portraits - Great art and attention to detail. Characters are expressive and it's nice to watch the cutscenes.\n+ Lots of Lore - Kind of necessary to explain some backstory when the names for the entities in the game are so stupid.\n+ Upgrades and Disassembly of weapons and accessories - Pretty cool system but it feels like I'm throwing a lot of items at something and it only gets a little bit better.\n\nNeutral:\n+ Linear Paths and Gameplay - If you don't want to think, this game's map is good for that. Go down every path the NPCs don't is my general rule.\n\nNegatives (oh man, and are there ever negatives):\n+ The ♥♥♥♥♥iest camera ever - Like it really just sucks major ♥♥♥♥. There's no visual feedback to let you know that the camera can't be turned in certain areas and it defaults to an awful location. Its turning speed is incredibly slow and you can't change its settings except for inverting its axis.\n+ Defaulting to Auto-battle can just make battles "Press Enter To Win"\n+ Grinding gets significantly less effective in a short amount of time - Enemies offer less CP and abilities cost a LOT more.\n+ You can't freely move in battle - Which may seem obvious, but characters just wander around as they please and can get hit by AOE spells at low health.\n+ No option to turn off animations for changing Paradigms - At first it starts of by focusing on each character and this ACTUALLY TAKES TIME IN BATTLE. While you're transforming, someone can die and you're basically ♥♥♥♥ed.\n+ Can't control other members in battle\n+ When your Leader dies, it's game over - Even though other characters can learn to raise other team members from death!\n+ Bland characters\n+ Sometimes difficult to understand map - Trying to find Marks to hunt and I can't figure out where they're meant to be.\n+ Characters can't actually walk straight - They default to North on the minimap, but the map actually starts turning slowly while walking so you start walking diagonally in hallways.\n+ Limited settings interaction\n\nThe list could go on, but I can't really think of anything else at the moment. This game reminds me of Ni no Kuni but it sucks as a port. I'd play it as a PS3 game, but not as a PC game. I'm going to stick with it and its sequels just because I've come this far.","November 24, 2014","false","87.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The game is totally linear, like following a story set in stone and does not offer much in the RP department either. I got the feeling of watching a movie somewhat.\nThe story is not of the caliber of the previous entries in the series either, being somewhat boring and hard to understand at some points, due to unique to the story terms being introduced almost constantly with little to no clarification of their meaning, leaving the player confused.\n\nAnd after all these you will ask me, "and why have you given this game a positive review?". This is a great question, because I am going to list you this game's great points and what someone who tries to decide if he wants to play it or not can expect from this game. First I want to clarify that this is not the greatest Final Fantasy game I have played, it's actually closer to the worst title I have played (maybe after FFX-2). However, being a fan of the series and with many new innovations added to the gameplay experience, I can't bring myself to not recommend others to play it, at least people who have played and enjoyed another Final Fantasy series in the past.\n\nI will begin from this game's greatest point, in my opinion, which is the new combat system. Although people will argue that it looks boring and repetitive at first (I can't blame them), the new role-based battle system is a great addition to the series. It comes with an incredibly good AI for issuing the non player-controlled characters (or the player-controlled character as well if you wish so) and, even if it's not really intuitive at first, offers a great diversity to the gameplay experience and the user costumization. If you are a casual user, who is here for an easy experience and wants just to see the story and rush through the content, you can keep allowing the AI to do most of the work and finish the game without many problems (except for a few battles). On the other hand, if you are a hardcore gamer and interested in a more intense experience, you can choose to take all the actions yourself, while having the possibility to speed things up or simplify some actions by understanding how the AI works and using it only when you feel necessary.\nAdditionally, even though the story is mostly linear (like I said earlier), it gets an open-world chapter much later in the game which improves the game's total feeling and allows for some pretty great post-game action that saves the title from getting a negative review from me. I also really enjoyed the wide range of customization of the characters in every aspect; skills, equipment and roles, like in all entries of the series, although I still prefer the older systems in some aspects.\n\nTo sum things up, FFXIII is a game that I can recommend to anyone, both casual and hardcore gamers with fans of the series getting the most out of the experience, will suggest however that you start with earlier titles of the Final Fantasy series first if you haven't played any, which are much better in every aspect.","January 16","true","115.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Megamean09/recommended/292120/","Megamean09","Zihark Akemi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Megamean09/","75 products in account","XIII is a pretty polarizing entry in the Final Fantasy franchise. While I can understand why, I certainly don't agree with the haters; the things that warrant complaint from others are some of the bigger things I like about it. Let's take a look at these first.\n\nTo start with, YES, it's linear. Most of the chapters are pretty straightforward. To me, this meant less time spent looking for your destination and more time heading there. But if you don't like the idea of little exploration, then I suppose this would be an issue to you.\n\nAnother compliant I hear a lot is about the level-up system, the Crystarium. For the first two chapters (few hours), your characters can't get any stronger, but I didn't notice this for a while and didn't mind. It actually makes sense in-universe that the characters can't become magic-slinging superhumans until they're no longer normal humans. Once you get it, the Crystarium progresses in stages, up to 10, and though you can accumulate more CP (EXP equivalent), you can only upgrade as much as your current Crystarium stage allows. This means you can only be as strong as Squenix decided you'd need to be at that point. Yes, this means you can't overlevel, but it also means that you'll always know that if you're stuck on a boss, it's not your characters, it's your tactics.\n\nThe battle system uses six different roles, with each character having three as their primary roles (they unlock the others as secondary roles late-game): Commandos, who do the most damage, Ravagers, who use elemental attacks to exploit enemy weaknesses and build the Stagger meter, Sentinels, who draw enemy aggro, Synergists, your buffers, Saboteurs, your debuffers, and Medics, self-explanatory. You can store up to six "Paradigms" of different roles for your party to switch between in battle as need arises. For example, open by having a couple Synergists buff the party while a Saboteur debuffs the enemy, switch to Commandos and Ravagers to attack, and switch to a paradigm with a medic or two when your health is low. You can only directly control your party's leader, but the ai is programmed to use what's needed where it's needed- Medics prioritize healing the party member closest to death, Ravagers use elements the enemy is weak to and stop using elements that don't work on it, etc.\n\nHow does this game look and sound? I think it's beautiful. There are a lot of great environments you'll travel through, and you'll stop on those linear paths a lot to admire them. The summoning sequences look so good they'd make a fitting wallpaper. The soundtrack doesn't stick out much in my memory, but it's not bad. You won't get sick of, and there are a couple pieces you're sure to like.\n\nThe plot's one of those types that's intentionally vague at first: you'll wonder how A led to B and what even caused A, but the backstory leading up to the start of the game is all revealed in bits and pieces as you go along. I won't say much on what the plot consists of, but I would put it among the better plots for the eight numbered Final Fantasies I've played.\n\nTo wrap it up, if either or both of those common complaints are a minus for you, then you probably won't enjoy it. But if you don't mind or consider them pluses, I don't see why you wouldn't. This game has a fast-paced battle system that'll keep you busy, scenery I've got multiple screenshots of on my profile, and a plot I looked forward to seeing through to the end. It doesn't feel much like prior Final Fantasy installments, but that doesn't mean it's not a great game.","April 21, 2015","true","108.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

This essentially makes a sub-franchise of the FF series, where this series in particular has multiple games all clumped up together with the same mythology, but with different stories all together.\n\nI remember way back when they first teased this game in 2006; I believe at E3. It was pretty big news for Final Fantasy in general, so when this game finally came out it was hyped up a lot for being the next main installment in the FF franchise. This FF in particular has a very unique concept and setting overall. Among the other FF this takes the trophy for being the most Sci-fi-esque one. Comparing this to FFX, FFXII, or even FFVII this one is incredibly futuristic as seen in the trailers, which may turn you off a little from the traditional medieval setting that FF used to be known for. Nonetheless this game proves to be very beautiful, and divergent from the rest of the games in it's own little way. A lot of FF games age pretty well, but after 6 years this game still shines bright among other modern titles.\n\nThe game starts off very user friendly if you will. About the first 8-9 chapters of this game can be considered a tutorial for the entire game, which is actually quite disappointing since there's only 13 chapters total. Square Enix was playing it perhaps to safe this time, and wanted to appeal to a more broader audience because compared to other FF's this one is the easiest, and the most linear even moreso than FFX. In a way I appreciate how painless the game can be on your first playthrough, but there're parts where you feel like gouging your eyes out because of this certain boss. Some of the enemies you engage do require atleast some sort of skill, which leads to the battle system. Square created a new system called ATB, which essentially voids the old FF turn-based gameplay mechanics for what it was originally known for.\n\nYou can view this as a positive or negative thing, but imo it made the game easier than it should of been. Some people will say that it's a boring mechanic and express that by saying all you do is button mash "auto-battle" endlessly thus resulting in an automatic win. Now I won't say that they're wrong because they're in fact right in many occasions. I'm pretty adamant that you can finish this game's story by just doing that, however if you decide to complete the extracurricular activities; you will indeed find yourself in a more traditional JRPG FF of grinding and lvling up. Unfortunately a lot of the side quests won't open up until later in the game. If you're a person who just wants to play the game, and not care about the story than this game will not satisfy your needs until you progress through the story, which can be enjoyable or not depending on yourself. A battle team consists of 3 people. Only 1 character is assigned to you in a battle whom you control, while the other 2 are controlled by AI. However you are able to change your character in between battles, but you will find yourself only using 1-3 for the sake of strategy.\n\nThis brings us to the story of FFXIII, which is arguably very cliche yet imo very interesting and distinct among other games in general. Linearity was this games biggest problem, so you will find yourself being shoved tons of exposition down your throat 24/7, which some of us may enjoy. I personally didn't care as much because I found the concept of it very intriguing. You got 6 main characters: Lightning, Snow, Sazh, Hope, Fang, and Vanille. Serah is another character who sort of has a role in this game, but you never play or control her. Lighting is the essential main character who was posted on promotional art. She's a strong individual who's stoic, humble, lacks humor, and resembles a soldier of an army. Snow is your average wannabe hero, but lacks intelligence and can't face facts. Sazh is the comic relief racial diversive character. Hope is your annoying little brat who later develops into a stronger individual. Fang is much like Lightning, except much softer to her friends, and has humor. Vanille is your average annoying waifu little teenage girl from anime who's oblivious to everything. I must say that some of these characters are weak, but they all end up being solid ones in the end. I never found myself utterly annoyed by any of the characters except maybe Hope.\n\nThe main plot of the game is rebelling against the gods of the world, while creating/fighting for your own destiny. The 6 of the characters all end up meeting each other, and are given the same fate from the gods known as the Fal'Cie. The Fal'Cie turn the 6 humans into L'Cie, which basically makes them a demigod. They're given magic powers like summoning eidolons such as Bahamut and Odin. The people of their world (Cocoon) fear another world called Gran Pulse (the world beneath them...Literally). Cocoon is a planet that floats above the world of Gran Pulse, which is a wild land that consists of wild-life, and titan-like beings. The people of Cocoon have this irrational fear of an invasion from Gran Pulse, which is where our game begins. The story can be a little confusing because of the terminology they use to refer to the mythology, but if you can wrap your head around all of that; it becomes very clear.\n\nI personally think the best thing about this game is the soundtrack. Final Fantasy has always been known for their OST's, but this one blew me away. Nobuo Uematsu has always been known to be the composer for most of the FF's, but XIII had a brand new composer Masashi Hamauzu who did an amazing job. It has the right amount of instruments that create a soothing blend of euphoric music that is catchy, yet very distinctive from other FF OSTs. Serah's Theme, and Dust to Dust is a small sample of some of the great songs in this game. be sure to listen to the OST if you can.\n\nThe game runs okay for what it is. You might need an above average PC to run it flawlessly, but I noticed FPS drops during certain fights, but it shouldn't be anything gamebreaking. About 70% of the time you will have 60fps.\n\nThis game also has 2 sequels called XIII-2 and Lighting Returns. Both of them are shorter than this one, but the story of the 2 sequels are quite garbage. They utterly destroyed the perfect ending the original had, much like how X-2 dumpstered the original. I would recommend this game to anyone. I don't neccesarily think it's the greatest FF by any means, but it's not the worst imo. It's a beautiful game aesthetically, and stands out very well. If you can get past how linear it is, it can be very fun to watch and play.","January 17","true","34.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

The way the story is presented is confusing as hell but the music is pretty good.\n\nThe datalog feels more like a tool to help the developers keep track of what the hell's going on than designed for players.  "Wait, what's supposed to happen here again? Oh right." Mysterious shopping system built into save terminals that also allows you to upgrade your weapons and accessories.\n\nAt least they didn't make Hope's weapon a gun-boomerang.\n\nYeah, it's linear; blame the console - maps of original FFXIV was more or less the same until the uproar.  Fancy battle system that makes you press more buttons during fights.\n\nPretty CG cinematics.  Annoying antagonist who loves to destroy any sense of accomplishment you may feel after a hard-won victory.","January 29","true","33.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

I can comment on one issue I had and that was the controls stopped responding to my commands after a few hours of playing. I wouldn't be able to ALT+TAB out of the game and sometimes I would have to rely on it to get my controls back, at which point they would continually scroll through menu options making selection a timing-based thing. This was particularly horrible during battles and swapping paradigms. Since the game has been out for a long time I will be brief in my review.\n\nPros:\n+ Good English Voice Acting - I didn't know you could play it in Japanese, but I don't particularly want to hear a Japanese guy voice a black guy.\n+ Good Music - I owned the soundtrack before owning the game, so I played a vast majority of the game in silent minus the cutscenes.\n+ The Paradigm System - Once you can unlock swapping team members, the possibilities for battle styles becomes interesting and a lot of fun.\n+ The Crystarium - The game, as a JRPG, is obviously going to be grindy in a way and the Cyrstarium makes you feel like you're getting results from mindless battles.\n+ Rendered Cutscenes, and Character Portraits - Great art and attention to detail. Characters are expressive and it's nice to watch the cutscenes.\n+ Lots of Lore - Kind of necessary to explain some backstory when the names for the entities in the game are so stupid.\n+ Upgrades and Disassembly of weapons and accessories - Pretty cool system but it feels like I'm throwing a lot of items at something and it only gets a little bit better.\n\nNeutral:\n+ Linear Paths and Gameplay - If you don't want to think, this game's map is good for that. Go down every path the NPCs don't is my general rule.\n\nNegatives (oh man, and are there ever negatives):\n+ The ♥♥♥♥♥iest camera ever - Like it really just sucks major ♥♥♥♥. There's no visual feedback to let you know that the camera can't be turned in certain areas and it defaults to an awful location. Its turning speed is incredibly slow and you can't change its settings except for inverting its axis.\n+ Defaulting to Auto-battle can just make battles "Press Enter To Win"\n+ Grinding gets significantly less effective in a short amount of time - Enemies offer less CP and abilities cost a LOT more.\n+ You can't freely move in battle - Which may seem obvious, but characters just wander around as they please and can get hit by AOE spells at low health.\n+ No option to turn off animations for changing Paradigms - At first it starts of by focusing on each character and this ACTUALLY TAKES TIME IN BATTLE. While you're transforming, someone can die and you're basically ♥♥♥♥ed.\n+ Can't control other members in battle\n+ When your Leader dies, it's game over - Even though other characters can learn to raise other team members from death!\n+ Bland characters\n+ Sometimes difficult to understand map - Trying to find Marks to hunt and I can't figure out where they're meant to be.\n+ Characters can't actually walk straight - They default to North on the minimap, but the map actually starts turning slowly while walking so you start walking diagonally in hallways.\n+ Limited settings interaction\n\nThe list could go on, but I can't really think of anything else at the moment. This game reminds me of Ni no Kuni but it sucks as a port. I'd play it as a PS3 game, but not as a PC game. I'm going to stick with it and its sequels just because I've come this far.","November 24, 2014","false","87.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

For the first 30+ hours, you are railroaded along with minimal input, occasional fights (auto attack) and a LOT of FMV.\nThe storyline is a little confusing and even non-sensical (I honestly think its the absolute worst FF storyline, ever, having played everything since 3) but I love the character development.\nForget the l'Cie, forget the Fal'Cie, forget the never ending fight between Cocoon and Gran Pulse, listen to Lightning, Vanille, Fang, Sazh, even Snow and Hope as they grow and realise that the world is a much bigger place than they thought it was and that their own problems are really quite petty in the grand scheme.\nAuto Attack really does kill off the majority of fighting, but the paradigm system shines when the going gets tough, being able to switch in healers, buffers and debuffers and swap melee / ranged classes as required was a masterstroke of design, its the single biggest inovation in the FF franchise in a long time, so much so I found the 6 variation limit too... limiting.\nThe side quests (Ci'eth Stone missions and Choco treasure hunting) do offer some variation, but even when on Gran Pulse, there is quite limited freedom and whilst quite large, there are too many tunnels.\nFinishing the game isnt terribly hard, but if you want to level your main teams weapons up, finish the Ci'eth Stones / Titan Missions, then you are going to have to farm a fair bit as you are fairly starved for gil unless you focus on earning it.\n\nOverall, a good port of a somewhat different Final Fantasy game that has garnered a lot of love and hate over the years.","April 2","true","93.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

No char development in late-stage for the others.\n\nEnvironment & Graphics - 9/10\nImmersive worlds & in-game graphics.  Smooth for me, but maybe I have a good PC.\n\nGameplay - 4/10\nMaps are very linear.  Thought it suits a complex story that might unravel if I roam and deviate often. 1 or 2 maps were unfinished with a lot of secondary paths with no treasures or monsters.\nThe battles are much simplified now.  Some battles are over with just pushing the X button 6 times or so, no joke! The hard battles are more fun and involving.\n\nStory - 1/10\nA lot of 'deus ex machina' especially in the ending.  No, you're NOT supposed to know why the the chars turned back from l'cieth into humans at the end.  They haven't fulfilled any focus then (either destroying Orphan / saving Cocoon).  Another example is Cid Raines helping & training the chars under the order of Barthandelus (main antagonist) to make them stronger ... as a team!!  Defeats the purpose of having a SINGLE ragnarok.\n\nAt the end, I still don't know if the 'focus' was to destroy Cocoon (completely covered with magma, before turned into ice) or save Cocoon (humans and creatures were evac'ed into the much larger Pulse world).\n\n\nConclusion - 5/10\nThis is a game like the Transformation movies.  Top-notch visuals & slick presentation, but cheesy emotions (cringe-worthy in the final against the story bosses).  Coupled with a bland pop song 'My Hands' by Leona Whois.\n\nHuge budget and talents poured into FF13, yet soulless.

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","261 products in account","I've finally gotten to Grand Pulse, but at this point I honestly don't feel like exploring.\n\nIt took me a little over 25 hours to finally reach the open world portion of the game, and knowing that it's almost over I honestly just wanna continue and finish it.\n\nFFXIII has large production values-the music, visuals, and mythos are all there. But it makes for a lousy game. You've probably heard this before but I'm just gonna regurgitate it: this game is sofa king linear. It's INCREDIBLY linear. There are no treasure chests, no hidden pathways, or even different ways to get from point A to B. The damn thing might as well be on-rails. ♥♥♥♥ at least change the damn perspective so that I gotta hit back on the joystick to continue moving forward or something. I can do it myself by manually changing the perspective, but it's just not the same, Square.\n\nIt's not the same.\n\nI'm not big on the Final Fantasy series, but I did play FFX, which was just as linear. But X at least had the courtesy of giving you a full party in the first 5 hours, and I tolerated its linearity around the 15 hour mark as its plot became intersting. By contrast, FFXIII does everything in its power to never allow you to have a full party. You FINALLY get to arrange your party and get the full cast together around the 75% mark.\n\nI could excuse the story not allowing you to have a full party if something interesting came of it. But from chapters 2 to 7 it's just people fuc*ing around not knowing what the hell they should do. The characters are all forcefully branded as enemies of the state by a lowerworld entity, and if they fail to follow through with the task they turn to horrendous beasts. If they DO follow through, they basically turn to stone, so they're screwed either way. They spend chapters 2-7 not knowing whether they should fight against their homeland or if that is even their assigned task (it's not explicitly stated). So you get people wandering around the whole damn place running from the military that's hunting them down while cursing their fate. It's the gaming equivalent of what you did in your High School essays: pad the sh*t out of them with size 13 font and repetition. The strange part is, there's this whole backstory to the rivalry between the worlds of Pulse and Coccoon that COULD HAVE been delved into more deeply and presented a LOT of room for backstory. But it's given a passing mention in in-game files, which is just horrible plot management. I guess wasting my time with nothing happening was a better use of chapters than actually exploring the game's mythos.\n\nTowards the end I got the feeling the writers hit a wall with the storyline. The protagonists are all essentially 'bad guys', but they can't be bad cause they're protagonists! So instead the narrative reasons around the 9th chapter that they are actually good guys taking down a society ruled by corrupt Gods! Oh but hey the entities they're being forced to take down turn out to REALLY BE bad so its cool! It feels like a damn cop-out. Instead of having a game where they really are damned and forced to be the evil of society it turns out that-oh hey they're actually doing good cause they really ARE taking out bad dudes! Lame. It's so damn convenient, isn't it. But that's just me not being satisfied with the story's trajectory.\n\nThe battle system is alright for the first few hours. You queue up attacks that are carried out when your ATB gauge fills up, so if you idle while it's full you're just wasting time. That would be problematic if there was any complexity involved. All your characters have a skill that outright tells you everything about the enemy. Use it once and then just hammer away at the enemies weakness to build up its stun gauge. After it's stunned just auto attack. If it's a boss or a battle that takes a bit of time then prep up some people to debuff the enemy/buff up the party while ocassionally getting a healer to queue up healing spells when health goes low. If it's a run of the mill battle forego the stun gauge and just hammer away at it. You can either 'blitz' to hit enemies in a wide area (takes a larger portion of your ATB gauge) or 'attack'. It's not hard.\n\nIt becomes just as repetitive as all the linear corridor exploration. Speaking of which, the level up system might as well have been left on the cutting room floor. It's just as linear as everything else. There are 6 roles and all the characters specialize in three. Towards the end all roles open up for the characters, so that Vanille can now be trained as a commando and learn the skills in that role. Too bad the costs to reach tier 1 in that role are INSANE, so you're better off spending your experience points where you've been spending them all along. You can spend 6000 points to reach the first tree in a role that gives, say, +10 hp or +4 strength. Or you can use that same amount to reach tier 4 of the roles the characters already been levelling up and gain +100HP or +20 strength. It's really more of a way to keep you busy post-game (intensive grinding).\n\nThe weapon system is just as stupid. You can level them up as well, the problem is that it takes so long. Once you've invested a sh*tload of cash into your first weapon, you won't want to level up any of the newer weapons you find cause you're so invested in the previous one. Besides, its current stats are better than the newer weapons you've found anyway so what's the point?\n\nMaybe Gran Pulse really is this fantastic place that will make me have a more positive attitude about the game and will drown me in money and XP so that I can level up all the weapons to a reasonable degree and break tier 2 of the newly opened trees for every character. Maybe the story will pull out some fantastic sh*t at this point that will really blow me the hell away. But if it took 30 hours for the game to turn around then don't bother. FFXIII has some high production values, but objectively it's hard to call this game good.\n\nPS. Sazh is such a cool guy. I think everyone who's played this game agrees that Sazh is awesome. And Lightning's a pretty cool and likable protagonist.\n\ntoo bad the game's mediocre. It's not terrible, it's just really lack luster and, honestly, a waste of time. That's honestly the first game I've ever said that of that I think PERFECTLY captures it's 'spirit'\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII: a waste of time -Cpt. Moist Panties\n\nEdit-finished the game. The 'open-world' portion consists of doing missions that are simple 'go defeat this monster' grindfests. The ending is a 'happily ever after' type that doesn't actually explain what the ♥♥♥♥ the characters actually did to save the world. They throw a lot of the plot out the window for a bad ''lights started shinning and the world was saved because there were a lot of shiny lights'' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It actually made me hate the game cause a lot goes unanswered. Fu*k this. I mean, seriously, fu*k this game. I totally don't want conclusions to my plots with explenations. If there's a shiny light show and people hug it out at the end and say 'we did it' that's totally good enough and I don't need to actually have questions answered. Hey, they were under threat of being turned to crystal for eternity, and they did for a total of three seconds. Then they broke out of it with the perfect explanation being 'yay us!'. I hate this game so damn much. If this game was a child I'd orphan the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.","January 24, 2015","false","100.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","4"

I believe it has a lot to do with your expectations going in. If you are anticipating a generic RPG or even Final Fantasy experience, then you are in for a surprise or perhaps disappointment. If you approach this game with an open mind, you may find it to be a unique and enjoyable journey.\n\nIn my opinion, this game was sufficiently challenging. It's not a game you can smash one button through while staring off into space. The battle system is one of the best I have experienced in any RPG. It is unique, fast-paced, and requires you to think strategically. If you don't have an understanding of how the different battle roles work and enter fights blindly, you are going to have a bad time. That said, once you have grasped how things work, it is much easier, but still not too easy. The battle system and the challenging nature of the battles are the highlight of this game.\n\nThe characters are likable and inspiring. There were several scenes that I felt were very emotional and made me cry a bit (secretly, of course). As for the story itself, as someone who has grown up playing RPGs, I feel there are few unique storylines. Pretty much everything has been done before in one way or another. What matters to me is how a story is told. Like almost every Final Fantasy game, they hit the nail on the head with this one. The story unfolds beautifully and draws you in. I have heard some people say the story is confusing. I felt this way at first, but as the game went on it made sense. I guess you just have to give it a chance and try not to think too deeply. It's actually rather straightforward for the most part. Also, there is a datalog you can access in the game that includes entries on people, events, and history and myths, which should provide more detailed information.\n\nOne of the biggest critisims I have seen about this game is its linear nature. For some it is their only complaint but it completely ruins the game for them. Without spoiling the story for anyone, If this game were more open world it would not make sense. The fact that it feels like a "hallway simulator" to many people is completely understandable, but I feel as though this makes it easier to relate to the characters and what they are going through with the themes of fate and destiny, and their personal circumstances. Even the limited interaction with NPCs makes sense once you have an understanding of what's happening.\n\nIn conclusion, if you'd like to experience a strategic, fast-paced battle system, and a well told story, give this one a chance. I really enjoyed it and I hope you do too.","December 31, 2014","true","80.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I heard it wasn't a true Final Fantasy, the story was confusing, the controls are ridiculous and so on. But it was finally available on pc and it bore the name Final Fantasy so what the heck, I bought it. And I'm very glad I did.\n\nFirst of the world looks simply gorgeous. Everything is a joy to see and nothing is the same. Sure, nowadays we expect everything in HD and this is not, but I could care less. The graphics are simply awesome. Zero complaints here.\n\nSecondly, the story isn't that confusing at all. Sure, in the beginning you go what in the name of insanity is going on, but it all becomes clearer the further you get in the game. For me it was an incentive to keep playing because I wanted to know what it was with Vanille, the whole stuff and more. Neither does the story progress very linear. It may seem that way because you traverse linear places, everything's a hallway basically, but you jump pretty much everywhere. The linear hallways didn't bother me either, but that's probably more due to the fact I always get lost on world maps and find three other places before I find the one I need. Once you're on Gran Pulse the linearity decreases in the field as well.\n\nThirdly, the battlesystem was great. You're not exactly controlling all your characters anymore, but you still have some flexibility. Two of your team do whatever the heck they want, but within their role you assign them and you have total control over your team leader. Not to mention, you can switch jobs in the middle of battle. It makes for some great versatility and no more useless healers unable to do anything but sit back and enjoy the show.\n\nThe game is really easy to control too. I played with keyboard and mouse and the controls were really easy to learn, though I did remap the pause button. Just remember that spacebar works like enter and you're fine.\n\nFifthly, the game made me fall in love with the characters. They were well done, had motives and grew over the course of the game. They are far from flat and their interactions are fun to watch.\n\nI do have some complaints though. First of, Snow takes an incredibly long time to stop exclaiming he's a hero. I heard you the first thousand times Snow. Secondly, Vanille makes some definitely dubious sounds. My major gripe though is the money issue. Where's the gil? I spent most of the time completely broke. You don't get money from defeating enemies, so you'd better start beating every PSICOM ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you see and then some, and hope they drop loads of incentive chips and credit chips to sell.\n\nIn the end, is it a true Final Fantasy game? Heck if I know. What makes a game Final Fantasy anyway? It does have a depressing lack of moogles, but the Chocobo chick Sazh carries around more than makes up for that.","February 3, 2015","true","82.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

It is also made fun of as a game that is very linear through almost the whole game (there is a certain point in the game where you can do sidequests and explore a bit and can return to that point near the endgame) being dubbed as a "hallway simulator." Also made fun of by its vast amount of cutscenes, which are wonderfully shot and beautiful, also calling the game a "movie." This is a title that shouldn't be avoided by any type of Final Fantasy fan whether a newcomer or long time fan such as myself. And as per usual from a JRPG, the combat is a new form of active choice based combat, even if you can let the game optimize the attacks and support by simply selecting "auto," it still lets you switch the team's roles and plan the battle according to the situation at hand.\n\nTo summarize, give it a try before you join the naysayers who most likely just judge a book by its cover, so enjoy the music, the wonderful visuals, and the interesting combat.","July 22, 2015","true","70.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The game is pretty much one giant linear corridor for the first 20-30 hours. The game doesn't even seem to try and hide it with no real towns or buildings along the way until like 10-15 hours in. However, the combat is very fun and unique compared to other turn based games as it includes a huge amount of real time combat elements and the game gets quite challenging despite a slow start. The combat also works suprising well with a keyboard and mouse. I played through the entire game with kb+m despite believing initially that I would need a controller to play. Customization could be deeper but is still there. Graphics are excellent for a console port and the story is very interesting. However, there are some noticeable port issues despite the fixes the implemented. There are still very few graphics option. I also got random framedrops in some overworld areas despite playing on a 780 ti with 16 gigs of ram and an i7 4790k. It seems the framerate drops were totally random and seemed to mostly occur when there was very little occuring on the screen compared to where you would normally expect frame drops, in the larger more open areas later in the game and in combat.\n\n7/10","April 14, 2015","true","35.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

One of the (if not THE) most hated Final Fantasy in existence, has such infamy that I expected very little of the game when I got it here on PC....\n\n\n....and it's not THAT bad.\n\n\nWell, I can see why you'd hate it if you came in from all the other FF's. The world map got, for the most part, reduced to corridor walking, no towns to speak of, the story is incomprehensible if you don't read a primer sitting somewhere in the menu, the game takes a long time before it gives you full control (the famous "it gets good in 20 hours) and battles are quite simplified, to the point that most of them are basically automated.\n\n...but all of these turned out not to be that much of a turn-off to me. In battles, the stagger system helps turn things around, with quite a few enemies gaining weaknesses that didn't have before (ie: status ailments are finally useful in a FF game)\n\nGraphically, the game looks very good! I'd say unusually good for a 7th gen game, and until recently, only with mods could you see it in full 1080p, but latest patch thankfully adds resolution & GFX options. Unfortunately, framerate is still a hot mess, with SE promising 60fps, but the game actually having a hard reaching that, even with good hardware (4670k+R9 280). Expect battles to run @ 30fps for the most part.\n\n\nSo, to sum my opinion: Good game, "heh" Final fantasy game, terrible framerates. Recommend buying it on sale if you have some interest in the game/series.\n\n\nPS: note that the Asian version is regionally restricted AT RUN-TIME! Meaning you can't run the game outside of Asia if you bought it from there. Unless you really want JP subtitles, you should try to get someone to gift you the western version, as it includes both ENG & JP voices.\n(source: https://steamdb.info/sub/41110/)","October 10, 2014","true","59.0"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","4"

I believe it has a lot to do with your expectations going in. If you are anticipating a generic RPG or even Final Fantasy experience, then you are in for a surprise or perhaps disappointment. If you approach this game with an open mind, you may find it to be a unique and enjoyable journey.\n\nIn my opinion, this game was sufficiently challenging. It's not a game you can smash one button through while staring off into space. The battle system is one of the best I have experienced in any RPG. It is unique, fast-paced, and requires you to think strategically. If you don't have an understanding of how the different battle roles work and enter fights blindly, you are going to have a bad time. That said, once you have grasped how things work, it is much easier, but still not too easy. The battle system and the challenging nature of the battles are the highlight of this game.\n\nThe characters are likable and inspiring. There were several scenes that I felt were very emotional and made me cry a bit (secretly, of course). As for the story itself, as someone who has grown up playing RPGs, I feel there are few unique storylines. Pretty much everything has been done before in one way or another. What matters to me is how a story is told. Like almost every Final Fantasy game, they hit the nail on the head with this one. The story unfolds beautifully and draws you in. I have heard some people say the story is confusing. I felt this way at first, but as the game went on it made sense. I guess you just have to give it a chance and try not to think too deeply. It's actually rather straightforward for the most part. Also, there is a datalog you can access in the game that includes entries on people, events, and history and myths, which should provide more detailed information.\n\nOne of the biggest critisims I have seen about this game is its linear nature. For some it is their only complaint but it completely ruins the game for them. Without spoiling the story for anyone, If this game were more open world it would not make sense. The fact that it feels like a "hallway simulator" to many people is completely understandable, but I feel as though this makes it easier to relate to the characters and what they are going through with the themes of fate and destiny, and their personal circumstances. Even the limited interaction with NPCs makes sense once you have an understanding of what's happening.\n\nIn conclusion, if you'd like to experience a strategic, fast-paced battle system, and a well told story, give this one a chance. I really enjoyed it and I hope you do too.","December 31, 2014","true","80.1"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

I heard it wasn't a true Final Fantasy, the story was confusing, the controls are ridiculous and so on. But it was finally available on pc and it bore the name Final Fantasy so what the heck, I bought it. And I'm very glad I did.\n\nFirst of the world looks simply gorgeous. Everything is a joy to see and nothing is the same. Sure, nowadays we expect everything in HD and this is not, but I could care less. The graphics are simply awesome. Zero complaints here.\n\nSecondly, the story isn't that confusing at all. Sure, in the beginning you go what in the name of insanity is going on, but it all becomes clearer the further you get in the game. For me it was an incentive to keep playing because I wanted to know what it was with Vanille, the whole stuff and more. Neither does the story progress very linear. It may seem that way because you traverse linear places, everything's a hallway basically, but you jump pretty much everywhere. The linear hallways didn't bother me either, but that's probably more due to the fact I always get lost on world maps and find three other places before I find the one I need. Once you're on Gran Pulse the linearity decreases in the field as well.\n\nThirdly, the battlesystem was great. You're not exactly controlling all your characters anymore, but you still have some flexibility. Two of your team do whatever the heck they want, but within their role you assign them and you have total control over your team leader. Not to mention, you can switch jobs in the middle of battle. It makes for some great versatility and no more useless healers unable to do anything but sit back and enjoy the show.\n\nThe game is really easy to control too. I played with keyboard and mouse and the controls were really easy to learn, though I did remap the pause button. Just remember that spacebar works like enter and you're fine.\n\nFifthly, the game made me fall in love with the characters. They were well done, had motives and grew over the course of the game. They are far from flat and their interactions are fun to watch.\n\nI do have some complaints though. First of, Snow takes an incredibly long time to stop exclaiming he's a hero. I heard you the first thousand times Snow. Secondly, Vanille makes some definitely dubious sounds. My major gripe though is the money issue. Where's the gil? I spent most of the time completely broke. You don't get money from defeating enemies, so you'd better start beating every PSICOM ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you see and then some, and hope they drop loads of incentive chips and credit chips to sell.\n\nIn the end, is it a true Final Fantasy game? Heck if I know. What makes a game Final Fantasy anyway? It does have a depressing lack of moogles, but the Chocobo chick Sazh carries around more than makes up for that.","February 3, 2015","true","82.6"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

After i have finished the story and almost all side quests i started to search about FF universe and another games, i also tryed some more FF games, not so many so far, FF13-2 FF13-3 Type 0 and FF4, just to compare this game with others, because lot of true FF fans just hate this game, so i was just wondered why. Well i saw lot of bad reviews with one main "problem" like they said, this game is too far different from FF universe, well i can say nothing about it, i repeat this is my first experience in FF, but i can say a lot of good things about this game.\n\n1. First of all graphic, i was really shocked, its just amasing, i didnt skip any cutscenes (about 8-10h ^^ even when i killed last bost and watched final cutscene, was another last boss after that and like 4-5 last scenes more, and then true final boss with true final cutscene), it looks very colorful and beaty, this game was originaly released in 2009-2010, and i tryed it in 2016. Graphic not main plus of this game, it just first thing i noticed\n\n2. Story. well first 5h i think i just didnt get any ♥♥♥♥ing minds about story, it was not even hard to understand, it just was like im playing it on japan, all i could say about story was 2 words: l'cie and Fal'cie. But after some time i realised whats going on (tnx to database) and was really inspired, its not that unique, it has same "rules" with same words like "love" "never" "together" "forever" and so on, whatever i liked it much, and one of reason because of music.\n\n3. Soundtrack. i already have favorites songs like "dust to dust", or "snow theme" or "Archylte Steppe theme". but most excited thing about music in this game is ♥♥♥♥ing right track in ♥♥♥♥ing right moment, really sometimes smiley sometimes lonely, but alwasy in right time and right place. for me one of this moment was when u first visited oerba and dust to dust song was playing, wet eyes\n\n4. Characters, and ofc perfect woman - beatch LIGHTNING, first i hated Snow much and ofc always crying Hope, but later in game i just couldnt imagine someone instead of anyone of the group, again was just perfect summ from both procs and cons, all chars will say typical ♥♥♥♥ in their dialogs, bla bla bla forever ever never whatever, but its just nice gang, at least i was enjoed while was with them, and btw for me vanille just a little bit high, not autism like all haters saying, and high woman its just fun. oneworddescribe Lightning - beatch/(or perfect, just same to me). Snow - "hero", Hope - woman/child, Sazh - black (no offence, no rasism, just one always must be black, because of rules, i repeat for me no matter even if they all were black, jsut fun to watch another game or movie where everyone white, but at least one must be for sure black, god tnx his son at least black too) Vanille - high, Fang - vanille's friend (show me you friends and i will tell about you, right?)\n\n5. Gameplay, talking about battle mechaincs now - so im not really that good in any strateges rts or turn based, not only i hate strateges, but it seems they hate me too, so i was really afraid of this here. Well for my pleasure gameplay is weird, i mean its not true turn based, and not true real time, i dont even know how to call it correct, just google it ^^. And when u not in battle u just moving straight forward from battle to battle. there is some kind of open world in post game, but whole game yes its linear, just regular walk from battle to battle through stroy cutscenes, but i cant say its bad, at least in this game. And also u will use 1 button always, yes its true this game is onebutton but only before first mob which kill you, well and even after u will still almost always use one button - auto attack, yes mob it wont be boss who KOed you first. But its not slasher with combos and etc, all u will need to do is figure out paradigms and equipment for this battle and correctly switch it during battle. For me at end it really remind just puzzle.\n\n6. Leveling system, ♥♥♥♥ yes i love it, its simple u cant screw it and then create new game just because of your inta was not enough for casting golems.... for me its perfect, u dont need at least read freaking guides about BEWARE ABOUT STAT POINTS SON\n\n7. I said at the begining not graphic main plus of this game, what is main u ask, i think all, i mean its not just graphic with some sountrack and so on in my list, i think all these things are just common but all they made this game perfect TOGETHER FOREVER WHATEVER\n\nPS: if u need cons feel free to just find red review in store page","March 16","true","111.7"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","5"

Some flaws but worth buying if you like a good story and fast paced battles.\n\nLooking at the reviews for this game, many seem to criticise it for two main problems: first is the lack of port and second is the corrider/linear styled gameplay that could potentially restrict the freedom you have when playing. However, I personally didn't have a problem with either.\nThe games's port for my laptop was absolutely fine. I experienced very minimal to absolutely no framedrops throughout my game time, even during battle scenes, and my laptop kept the game to a steady 60fps.\nThe linear styled gameplay, however, may put off some people from buying this game and I personally can understand that opinion. The game starts off very slowly at the beginning and most of the early hours spent on this game will consist of you of either watching cut scenes or simply swatting away easy enemies that adds very little experience in terms of content in the game.\nEven so, if you're a major FF fan or if you're a patient type, like me, the late game experience is certainly a reward for toiling through countless yet pointless hours. In my experience, the story line starts to bring life and excitement at around chapter 7 (some may disagree) and once you're about 20 hours in, the game finally provides an alternative to the monotonic, corridor styles gameplay and introduces the player to a vast, open world in which you can finally participate in some side missions or just explore and generally have fun. In addition, the battles start to feel more challenging, and with the entry of the paradigm shifts and techniques such as libra or summon, they begin to feel enjoyable and rich in content with great, fast paced action that'll keep you on your toes throughout the whole fight.\nIn conclusion, Final Fantast XIII is a good game. There are definitely some flaws that some gamers may not like and if they're the reason why it's preventing them from buying or liking this game, then I can only wave away what little argument i have and simply agree with them: everyone has their opinion. However, I think there are some who are too critical and too unfair which could then upset the true reflection of a solid, good game. Personally, I think this game is worth buying.\n\n\n\nI only wrote this long ♥♥♥ review because it's an excuse for revision, essay writing if you're wondering what i'm revising.\nAlso, if you think it's rubbish it's because i wrote it from the top of my head in under 5 minute and it's my first one :).","January 4","true","51.4"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

Anyways, it manages to catch you somehow, somewhen. The story is pretty good (in my opinion), as usual in this series. Kind of dystopian. The characters are also great, even if the conversations can be sometimes a bit awkward. But if you're used to watching japanese series you won't be bothered by that at all.\n\nAbout the fighting system, I was reticent but it's got its own style and it innovates. It's much more tactical, of course you can just press A and die of boredom but you can make battles much more interesting. It's up to you. Also, there are some cool challenges in this game, specially that stupid giant green thing (you will know what I'm talking about when time comes).\n\nI've played some other FF games and I think this is not the worst, as some other say. It has a lot of good new things and if you're willing to try something new, go ahead.

Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","261 products in account","I've finally gotten to Grand Pulse, but at this point I honestly don't feel like exploring.\n\nIt took me a little over 25 hours to finally reach the open world portion of the game, and knowing that it's almost over I honestly just wanna continue and finish it.\n\nFFXIII has large production values-the music, visuals, and mythos are all there. But it makes for a lousy game. You've probably heard this before but I'm just gonna regurgitate it: this game is sofa king linear. It's INCREDIBLY linear. There are no treasure chests, no hidden pathways, or even different ways to get from point A to B. The damn thing might as well be on-rails. ♥♥♥♥ at least change the damn perspective so that I gotta hit back on the joystick to continue moving forward or something. I can do it myself by manually changing the perspective, but it's just not the same, Square.\n\nIt's not the same.\n\nI'm not big on the Final Fantasy series, but I did play FFX, which was just as linear. But X at least had the courtesy of giving you a full party in the first 5 hours, and I tolerated its linearity around the 15 hour mark as its plot became intersting. By contrast, FFXIII does everything in its power to never allow you to have a full party. You FINALLY get to arrange your party and get the full cast together around the 75% mark.\n\nI could excuse the story not allowing you to have a full party if something interesting came of it. But from chapters 2 to 7 it's just people fuc*ing around not knowing what the hell they should do. The characters are all forcefully branded as enemies of the state by a lowerworld entity, and if they fail to follow through with the task they turn to horrendous beasts. If they DO follow through, they basically turn to stone, so they're screwed either way. They spend chapters 2-7 not knowing whether they should fight against their homeland or if that is even their assigned task (it's not explicitly stated). So you get people wandering around the whole damn place running from the military that's hunting them down while cursing their fate. It's the gaming equivalent of what you did in your High School essays: pad the sh*t out of them with size 13 font and repetition. The strange part is, there's this whole backstory to the rivalry between the worlds of Pulse and Coccoon that COULD HAVE been delved into more deeply and presented a LOT of room for backstory. But it's given a passing mention in in-game files, which is just horrible plot management. I guess wasting my time with nothing happening was a better use of chapters than actually exploring the game's mythos.\n\nTowards the end I got the feeling the writers hit a wall with the storyline. The protagonists are all essentially 'bad guys', but they can't be bad cause they're protagonists! So instead the narrative reasons around the 9th chapter that they are actually good guys taking down a society ruled by corrupt Gods! Oh but hey the entities they're being forced to take down turn out to REALLY BE bad so its cool! It feels like a damn cop-out. Instead of having a game where they really are damned and forced to be the evil of society it turns out that-oh hey they're actually doing good cause they really ARE taking out bad dudes! Lame. It's so damn convenient, isn't it. But that's just me not being satisfied with the story's trajectory.\n\nThe battle system is alright for the first few hours. You queue up attacks that are carried out when your ATB gauge fills up, so if you idle while it's full you're just wasting time. That would be problematic if there was any complexity involved. All your characters have a skill that outright tells you everything about the enemy. Use it once and then just hammer away at the enemies weakness to build up its stun gauge. After it's stunned just auto attack. If it's a boss or a battle that takes a bit of time then prep up some people to debuff the enemy/buff up the party while ocassionally getting a healer to queue up healing spells when health goes low. If it's a run of the mill battle forego the stun gauge and just hammer away at it. You can either 'blitz' to hit enemies in a wide area (takes a larger portion of your ATB gauge) or 'attack'. It's not hard.\n\nIt becomes just as repetitive as all the linear corridor exploration. Speaking of which, the level up system might as well have been left on the cutting room floor. It's just as linear as everything else. There are 6 roles and all the characters specialize in three. Towards the end all roles open up for the characters, so that Vanille can now be trained as a commando and learn the skills in that role. Too bad the costs to reach tier 1 in that role are INSANE, so you're better off spending your experience points where you've been spending them all along. You can spend 6000 points to reach the first tree in a role that gives, say, +10 hp or +4 strength. Or you can use that same amount to reach tier 4 of the roles the characters already been levelling up and gain +100HP or +20 strength. It's really more of a way to keep you busy post-game (intensive grinding).\n\nThe weapon system is just as stupid. You can level them up as well, the problem is that it takes so long. Once you've invested a sh*tload of cash into your first weapon, you won't want to level up any of the newer weapons you find cause you're so invested in the previous one. Besides, its current stats are better than the newer weapons you've found anyway so what's the point?\n\nMaybe Gran Pulse really is this fantastic place that will make me have a more positive attitude about the game and will drown me in money and XP so that I can level up all the weapons to a reasonable degree and break tier 2 of the newly opened trees for every character. Maybe the story will pull out some fantastic sh*t at this point that will really blow me the hell away. But if it took 30 hours for the game to turn around then don't bother. FFXIII has some high production values, but objectively it's hard to call this game good.\n\nPS. Sazh is such a cool guy. I think everyone who's played this game agrees that Sazh is awesome. And Lightning's a pretty cool and likable protagonist.\n\ntoo bad the game's mediocre. It's not terrible, it's just really lack luster and, honestly, a waste of time. That's honestly the first game I've ever said that of that I think PERFECTLY captures it's 'spirit'\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII: a waste of time -Cpt. Moist Panties\n\nEdit-finished the game. The 'open-world' portion consists of doing missions that are simple 'go defeat this monster' grindfests. The ending is a 'happily ever after' type that doesn't actually explain what the ♥♥♥♥ the characters actually did to save the world. They throw a lot of the plot out the window for a bad ''lights started shinning and the world was saved because there were a lot of shiny lights'' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It actually made me hate the game cause a lot goes unanswered. Fu*k this. I mean, seriously, fu*k this game. I totally don't want conclusions to my plots with explenations. If there's a shiny light show and people hug it out at the end and say 'we did it' that's totally good enough and I don't need to actually have questions answered. Hey, they were under threat of being turned to crystal for eternity, and they did for a total of three seconds. Then they broke out of it with the perfect explanation being 'yay us!'. I hate this game so damn much. If this game was a child I'd orphan the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.","January 24, 2015","false","100.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","4"

I never had the chance to finish this on the PS3 because the console was my cousin's, and not entirely mine. I understand why most people gave this a bad rep, but here are some simple explanations on why I like it more than I hate it.\n\nLinearity 11/10\n-the word I frequently see being used when describing FF13. But it's very sadly true. The FF series as a whole is known for its vast open world and the running around in different cities and completing mini games before going into the final battle. FF13 made me feel like playing a movie rather than a game with its dragging and frequent cutscenes and trodding on roads which can only lead you in one direction. You're literally running on a straight line, or an intersection that still ends up on one path. The only place you can freely enjoy is the open fields of Gran Pulse. Freedom is limited, which is ironic since the characters themselves were not given much.\n\nCharacters 6/10\n-Lightning is just too bland--a female version of Cloud Strife but worse. I felt like Fang should be the lead character, and Vanille the second (which makes sense because the creators originally wanted Lightning to have Fang's personality). Lightning is under the bundle of brooding, untalkative, serious main characters Square Enix seems to like. The first half of the game you're stuck with a bunch of people with no objective whatsoever, but still kept on running to wherever fate takes them. You get the brooding kid, the self-proclaimed hero, the father figure... basically people with more personality than Lightning. You may hate them at first, but the long cutscenes and the story progress can make you like them little by little. The conversations between the characters were awkward and poorly written, but gets better fortunately.\n\nGameplay 8/10\n-The gameplay may have some few faults here and there, but it becomes fun as you progress. To be honest, I hated the battle system. You can only manually control one person, which is the battle leader. This could've been an okay concept but the game doesn't let you pick your teammates until the second half of the game. Otherwise, you're just stuck with only two people in one chapter (Hope and Lightning; Sazh and Vanille for example.) It's tedious to get into the battle system, but once you can unlock every single option, it becomes enjoyable. The paradigm and crystarium system is great, as you can choose what that certain character's specialty would be.\n\nMusic 10/10\n-There hasn't been an FF game that disappointed me at this component and FF13 is not an exception.\n\nGraphics 8/10\n-FF games have always been beautiful little things. Since FF13 was released years ago on last gen consoles, I still think it's pretty even up to today's standards. After the update, the developers added more graphical settings, but even on max settings I still get the jagged lines and low-res textures on some surfaces (but I guess it was just really made that way) They also recently added an 1080 version thank god.\n\nPlot 6/10\n-Basically, the game throws you in a world with no explanation, not even a little. They have a Datalog option which enables you to read about the background and history as you progress. I doubt people read all the pages in the Datalog. It took me a long time to differentiate l'Cie with Fal'Cie and C'ieth, etcetera. They don't explain ♥♥♥♥. Even the narratives and the long cutscenes isolate you. I like that they influence the story with Norse Mythology which I'm very interested in, but overall the plot was relatively okay, though it doesn't make sense most of the time, but I guess that's just the game's lack of explanation.\n\nTechnical 5/10\n-I have a generally ok rig, somewhere in the center of mid-tier and high-tier—an intel i7 and an AMD 7870 plus 12GB of ram. I could run most games smoothly on 1080p but this one seems to be an exception at first. It was stuttery--like hiccups. My FPS doesn't stay on 60, especially during battle. Small areas (like rooms and hallways) doesn't lag so much. When I finally couldn't take the 0.01 second stutters I searched the net for a fix. It worked, thankfully. But I wished the developers did something about it themselves, as the game seemed to always try to detect a game controller, which made it lag a lot.\n\nDespite my wavering review, I still recommend this game, but only to those familiar with the Final Fantasy franchise. I wouldn't recommend this game to someone who wants to get into the series. Still, I enjoyed it. I have a love-hate relationship with this game. The ending was so touching that I cried (literally) because of the utter satisfaction that I felt. I hope you'd give this game a try, especially since the price has gone down.","February 14, 2015","true","73.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/recommended/292120/","CPTMOISTPANTIES","Cpt. Moist Panties","http://steamcommunity.com/id/CPTMOISTPANTIES/","261 products in account","I've finally gotten to Grand Pulse, but at this point I honestly don't feel like exploring.\n\nIt took me a little over 25 hours to finally reach the open world portion of the game, and knowing that it's almost over I honestly just wanna continue and finish it.\n\nFFXIII has large production values-the music, visuals, and mythos are all there. But it makes for a lousy game. You've probably heard this before but I'm just gonna regurgitate it: this game is sofa king linear. It's INCREDIBLY linear. There are no treasure chests, no hidden pathways, or even different ways to get from point A to B. The damn thing might as well be on-rails. ♥♥♥♥ at least change the damn perspective so that I gotta hit back on the joystick to continue moving forward or something. I can do it myself by manually changing the perspective, but it's just not the same, Square.\n\nIt's not the same.\n\nI'm not big on the Final Fantasy series, but I did play FFX, which was just as linear. But X at least had the courtesy of giving you a full party in the first 5 hours, and I tolerated its linearity around the 15 hour mark as its plot became intersting. By contrast, FFXIII does everything in its power to never allow you to have a full party. You FINALLY get to arrange your party and get the full cast together around the 75% mark.\n\nI could excuse the story not allowing you to have a full party if something interesting came of it. But from chapters 2 to 7 it's just people fuc*ing around not knowing what the hell they should do. The characters are all forcefully branded as enemies of the state by a lowerworld entity, and if they fail to follow through with the task they turn to horrendous beasts. If they DO follow through, they basically turn to stone, so they're screwed either way. They spend chapters 2-7 not knowing whether they should fight against their homeland or if that is even their assigned task (it's not explicitly stated). So you get people wandering around the whole damn place running from the military that's hunting them down while cursing their fate. It's the gaming equivalent of what you did in your High School essays: pad the sh*t out of them with size 13 font and repetition. The strange part is, there's this whole backstory to the rivalry between the worlds of Pulse and Coccoon that COULD HAVE been delved into more deeply and presented a LOT of room for backstory. But it's given a passing mention in in-game files, which is just horrible plot management. I guess wasting my time with nothing happening was a better use of chapters than actually exploring the game's mythos.\n\nTowards the end I got the feeling the writers hit a wall with the storyline. The protagonists are all essentially 'bad guys', but they can't be bad cause they're protagonists! So instead the narrative reasons around the 9th chapter that they are actually good guys taking down a society ruled by corrupt Gods! Oh but hey the entities they're being forced to take down turn out to REALLY BE bad so its cool! It feels like a damn cop-out. Instead of having a game where they really are damned and forced to be the evil of society it turns out that-oh hey they're actually doing good cause they really ARE taking out bad dudes! Lame. It's so damn convenient, isn't it. But that's just me not being satisfied with the story's trajectory.\n\nThe battle system is alright for the first few hours. You queue up attacks that are carried out when your ATB gauge fills up, so if you idle while it's full you're just wasting time. That would be problematic if there was any complexity involved. All your characters have a skill that outright tells you everything about the enemy. Use it once and then just hammer away at the enemies weakness to build up its stun gauge. After it's stunned just auto attack. If it's a boss or a battle that takes a bit of time then prep up some people to debuff the enemy/buff up the party while ocassionally getting a healer to queue up healing spells when health goes low. If it's a run of the mill battle forego the stun gauge and just hammer away at it. You can either 'blitz' to hit enemies in a wide area (takes a larger portion of your ATB gauge) or 'attack'. It's not hard.\n\nIt becomes just as repetitive as all the linear corridor exploration. Speaking of which, the level up system might as well have been left on the cutting room floor. It's just as linear as everything else. There are 6 roles and all the characters specialize in three. Towards the end all roles open up for the characters, so that Vanille can now be trained as a commando and learn the skills in that role. Too bad the costs to reach tier 1 in that role are INSANE, so you're better off spending your experience points where you've been spending them all along. You can spend 6000 points to reach the first tree in a role that gives, say, +10 hp or +4 strength. Or you can use that same amount to reach tier 4 of the roles the characters already been levelling up and gain +100HP or +20 strength. It's really more of a way to keep you busy post-game (intensive grinding).\n\nThe weapon system is just as stupid. You can level them up as well, the problem is that it takes so long. Once you've invested a sh*tload of cash into your first weapon, you won't want to level up any of the newer weapons you find cause you're so invested in the previous one. Besides, its current stats are better than the newer weapons you've found anyway so what's the point?\n\nMaybe Gran Pulse really is this fantastic place that will make me have a more positive attitude about the game and will drown me in money and XP so that I can level up all the weapons to a reasonable degree and break tier 2 of the newly opened trees for every character. Maybe the story will pull out some fantastic sh*t at this point that will really blow me the hell away. But if it took 30 hours for the game to turn around then don't bother. FFXIII has some high production values, but objectively it's hard to call this game good.\n\nPS. Sazh is such a cool guy. I think everyone who's played this game agrees that Sazh is awesome. And Lightning's a pretty cool and likable protagonist.\n\ntoo bad the game's mediocre. It's not terrible, it's just really lack luster and, honestly, a waste of time. That's honestly the first game I've ever said that of that I think PERFECTLY captures it's 'spirit'\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII: a waste of time -Cpt. Moist Panties\n\nEdit-finished the game. The 'open-world' portion consists of doing missions that are simple 'go defeat this monster' grindfests. The ending is a 'happily ever after' type that doesn't actually explain what the ♥♥♥♥ the characters actually did to save the world. They throw a lot of the plot out the window for a bad ''lights started shinning and the world was saved because there were a lot of shiny lights'' ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t. It actually made me hate the game cause a lot goes unanswered. Fu*k this. I mean, seriously, fu*k this game. I totally don't want conclusions to my plots with explenations. If there's a shiny light show and people hug it out at the end and say 'we did it' that's totally good enough and I don't need to actually have questions answered. Hey, they were under threat of being turned to crystal for eternity, and they did for a total of three seconds. Then they broke out of it with the perfect explanation being 'yay us!'. I hate this game so damn much. If this game was a child I'd orphan the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥.","January 24, 2015","false","100.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","4"

I really only have two complaints, but it is enough that I wouldn't have purchased the game had I known this in advance.  I'm definitely waiting on FFXIII-2 and FFLR to see if they also have the same issues on the PC.\n\n1) 60GB for the game?  That is ridiculously massive, and there is no way I'd be able to store all three games on my main drive and have much room for anything else.  Even for those not running off of SSDs and have space, that is a long time spent downloading one game.\n\n2) No options to tune the graphics.  I know a lot of people are complaining about the lack of 1080p, but the game still looks pretty good at 720p.  I'd say it is much more close of a port of the XBOX360 version than the PS3 version, which makes sense considering the platform.  Regardless, it would be nice to tone down some of the options to play on lower end computers.

Visuals - awesome\n3. Cinematics - awesome\n4. Combat - awesome , new , fresh, chalanging\n5. Music - awesome, Final Fantasy standard\n6. Linear - yes u heard me. I did know the game will be linear and i bought it. Its like u watch an interactive movie.\n7. Very good menu control with mouse. Left click right click\n\n-Cons (spoilers)\n1. Console based - u move like moroon, u cant go where u want, invisible walls\n\n2. Linear - Yes LINEAR even the DIABLO is linear and u can go for ♥♥♥♥ing side quests. Here is nothing. Sometimes i have\nfeel thet the game plays itself. U have no control. U cant even go 5 meters to the side. U are in linear tunnel. Its like a railroad game\n3. No towns, no shops u just go straight forward.\n\n4. 10 chapters of the game u cant choose your party, and what is worse u cant change your leader. Once u get familiar with your curent party the game takes them from u. The game gives u another memmbers and  doesnt take carap about if u did spend all theyr CP points. You appear straight in the middle of the battle nad noone asks u if u are ready.\n\n5 Leveling - the leveling is interesting with one minor issue. Its a total crap. U just add more points and there are no crossroads. Do i wanna go fire magic or do i wanna go water magic. No you just add points and thats it. This is a travesty to the RPG. FF 12 had a great leveling system u could become anything here u will become the fabricated character.\n\n6. Level design - There is no level design. There are just textures in different tunnels. Each tunnel has 5-10 battles than u\ngo to another tunnel. No chests or secrets. When u see an dead end on the map u are sure there will be chest. U cant go anywhere, the game forces u to go only straight forward. ( u can go back obviously:-) )\n\n7 - movement - clasic console based - terrible. U cant jump. The game jumps automaticly. U have to aim precisly if u want to go inside some entrance.\n\n8 -  and many more...sry guys im so ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off on Square Enix, that i cant even finish this review. Sry for the gramar too im not english born.\n\nOK final result. Im NOT recommending this game.

Would've liked more free roam like in Chapter 11 with the GranPulse missions, a bit too much linear gameplay for my liking. Amazing soundtracks and cinematics, this game is just very aesthetically pleasing. The port was the only real problem, could have definitely been better, but it didn't bother me too much. Playing with a keyboard and mouse was really awkward, so I switched to XBOX 360 controller, and that made the experience a whole lot more enjoyable. The game was ~60GB, which is pretty absurd, but it includes voiceovers in English and Japanese, CG cutscenes, etc. FFXIII was well worth the money.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PukingMagma/recommended/292120/","PukingMagma","Rektless","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PukingMagma/","171 products in account","Let's just start by saying I have played every other Final Fantasy before this one except 9 and 11. I feel I need that preface so I don't get a lot of crap from crazy FF fans that dislike this game.\n\nWith that out of the way, I'll write as much of a review as I feel is needed for this game.\n\nI want to start by saying that with all the hate and bashing going on around this game, I put off playing it for YEARS because I never heard a good thing about it. It wasn't until I saw a stream of it that I decided I should play it. After having actually played the game, I have one question:\n\nWhy do people dislike this game so much?\n\nThe story is incredible, if a little difficult to follow. The combat and gameplay is actually better than in FFX due to the return of real-time battling, and to top it off the game actually has character development. There is an actual story to this game that keeps you engrossed in it, characters that actually have life, and smooth gameplay and graphics that don't leave you wishing there was something else in it. So where is all of this unfounded hate coming from?\n\nIf it's because of the linear nature of the game, maybe you just didn't spend enough time playing it. Without spoiling anything, once you get far enough along, the game opens up to a whole world of sidequests. Until that point, which, to be fair, is pretty far in, yes, the game is incredibly linear and not very open to exploration. People that dislike linear gameplay for lengthy periods of time may be the reason this game has many negative reviews.\n\nContinuing on that point, maybe it's the characters that people dislike? Well, if you continue playing the game, the characters really start fleshing out. One in particular, Hope, is... well, he's a weenie. A really big pansy. However throughout the game he toughens up and actually becomes quite the contributing character. I rather enjoyed seeing something like that coming from a final fantasy game, where the characters are usually figured out at the start and the story kind of revolves around them.\n\nPerhaps it's the systems that people hate? Well, the leveling system is reminiscent of the sphere grid from FFX, which I know got a lot of flak since it didn't follow traditional leveling systems. This system really isn't any different. You gain experience  (or CP in this case), figure out where you want it to go, then spend it moving forward in the class of your choice. To that end, the game actually offers some customization of characters, but once again, it takes a while to get to that point, and when you do you're basically already stuck with the main classes you started out with. This is basically the biggest gear that I had to grind with this game. It really wants you to stick with the set out course of character classes it has for you, and if you don't want to, you'll have to do a ton of grinding.\n\nThe other system that people may have issues with is the weapon and accessory upgrading system. With this, you can spend items to give your weapons EXP and level them up, to a maximum rating of a star. Once that's done, you spend a catalyst to upgrade the weapon to the next tier. The problem I have with this system is that every weapon becomes the same thing when fully upgraded. The only real difference is the passive abilities, which can be obtained from lower tier weapons. The other issue is that you can't fuse weapons to get other passive abilities, you can only use component items to upgrade. The problem here is actually a huge lack of customization, rather than a fair amount. Those who want to 100% completely customize their character (somewhat like you can do with the expert sphere grid in FFX International [or HD]) should probably look to a different game.\n\nOverall, I absolutely loved this game. I'd rate it probably an 8/10 mostly due to some gears I had to grind with the characters at the start and some of the systems implemented in the game to keep you from going too crazy with character classes. I'd recommend any fan of more recent final fantasies like 10 and 12 to give it a shot. Hell, even fans of the older games should at least try it. I think rather than just relying on word of mouth, people should experience the game themselves. This game gets a lot of flak for no good reason.","January 6, 2015","true","67.8"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

I played through the Xbox 360 when it first released back in 2010 and then once again in 2013 for PS3 and just completed another 100 hour playthrough for the PC, putting my life total at around 300 hours for this game. Quite a lot of time I must admit, but I feel this game's story and gameplay (despite some flaws) has great replay value and totally justifies coming back and revisiting the world of Cocoon and Gran Pulse every 2-4 years.\nOne of the main points of contention of this game is the 20-25 hours of travelling in corridors until you arrive at Chapter 11 in the story where the game opens up considerably. But I feel the developers made a wise decision in order to get the player to become emotionally invested in the characters. It's my opinion that if the game opened up completely from the outset, the developers would have had a much harder time trying to develop a cohesive narrative. Nonetheless, if you stick with it, the endgame will keep you quite busy with a myriad of freedom and challenges...you just have to endure 10 chapters of running through corridors.\n\nThe game truly shines in the combat department and you'll indubitably spend most of your time fighting monsters. It can become quite "grindy" trying to gather gil for your huge expenditures endgame, but unlike the aforementioned PS3 and Xbox360 versions I played through, the game allows you to switch over to an "easy" mode which greatly increases the drop rate from monsters. This helped me shave hours of my completion time versus the previous versions I played. Also, the combat mode (for the most part) requires your full attention and you have to do more than "repeatedly press x" in battles. When I am grinding endgame in other final fantasy titles, I tend to use about 10-20% of my attention in non-boss battles whilst reading or some other non-gaming activity. However, this game will require your full engagement throughout.\n\nOther reviewers have expressed the pros and cons quite well so I don't need to reiterate them here. To succintly put it; if you are willing to invest some time in the more trying sections of the first half of this game, I feel it can be a rewarding experience.","January 22","true","112.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cargotruck/recommended/292120/","cargotruck","Trifroze","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cargotruck/","12 products in account","FF13 probably has one of the slowest starts in a video game, not giving you full control of your party or what each character can do until you're around 20 hours in, and most of it essentially consists of running through corridors. The mechanics really start to shine once the game is running on full cylinder though, so much so that I'll have to say FF13 competes for the most interesting battle mechanics I've personally experienced, with a solid equipment upgrading system to go with as well. On the other hand the characters and the story are uninteresting and forgettable, and the PC port has considerable framerate issues pretty much regardless of what you're running. The visuals are pretty though, and the soundtrack is good.\n\nThe battles in the game use a variation of the ATB (Active Time Battle) system, in which you have a recharging gauge that has a number of bars, and each action consumes a certain amount of said bars, usually one. Enemies have different elemental weaknesses and are susceptible to different debuffs, and buffs/debuffs actually make a considerable difference in FF13. Each enemy also has a stagger bar which, once filled, will cause them to essentially become ragdolls for a short period of time, and the more you build up their stagger bar, the more damage they take. The most important and also the most interesting mechanic in the game is the Paradigm system, giving each of your three active battle members six different roles that they can take, each having their own benefits and ATB actions. Commando does the most damage, Ravager builds up the enemy's stagger bar quickly, Sentinel decreases the damage you receive by a considerable amount and lets you draw the enemy's attacks and tank their hits, Saboteur is for debuffs, Synergist is for buffs, and Medic is for healing. You can make several very relevant combinations of these, letting you set six of them at a time, and on many bosses you really have to figure out which ones to go with and when to quickly switch between each.\n\nThe equipment system in FF13 is also satisfying. Every character can equip up to four accessories and there are several useful ones that you can combine to really increase the potent of your characters, such as an accessory that reduces your entire damage intake by 20%, or accessories that considerably boost your strength or magic. All weapons and accessories have levels that you can increase by using any materials on them, and once maxed you can transform them into better versions of their particular line with a specific catalyst item. This process can be quite costly especially when it comes to upgrading weapons, and finding out effective ways to make the required money even before you're late into the game can make a big difference. The system is pretty simple but just complex enough, and it's satisfying to upgrade your items once you've finally managed to get some decent resources together.\n\nThere are 64 side missions for you to complete, all of which involve a special monster or a combination of those for you to hunt down. Many of these are some of toughest battles in the game so they force you to get yourself together and learn the game, nicely complementing the battle mechanics and equipment upgrade systems of FF13. While the game does have a fast travel system, it's a bit limited, and some of these missions will force you to run around more than you'd often like.\n\nGet this game for its solid mechanics, not the story. While the PC port is poorly executed, I still have to recommend it for its humble full price of 13€ at the time of writing this. FF13 a good game with some very strong points and some considerable shortcomings.","January 16","true","75.1"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

Why? Because it FEELS like a Final Fantasy; there's great character development, pacing, storyline, battles and of course outstanding music.\nThis is a perfect starting point for those new to the franchise. Although it may be confusing and overwhelming at first, I strongly suggest for those who are confused by the opening (which I will admit explains nothing) is to check the datalog entries on L'cie and Fal'cie etc.\nNow. Onto the meat of the game.\nLike previous FFs, progress is largely done by exploration and battles. Sadly, exploration is where the game falls short. No doubt you've heard of the lineraty of the game, and its true. You will be walking in a hallway-like fashion most of the time. However, the game does open up at a late stage in the game which is great for those yearning for side-quests and exploration - that they are plenty.\nInstead of following the traditional method of Turn-Based battles, all battles will be in real time which makes the game far more interesting and difficult at parts.\nOn the whole, this was my first FF and I loved it. Where it falls short is on-the-rails exploration and the game holding your hand most of the time. However, this will be undoubtedly be overpowered by the sheer production values and experience this game possess.","December 31, 2015","true","23.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

15 minutes.\n\nthat said, this brings me to what i consider to be the only major cons to the game as well. first of all, you can only ever control one character in battle. and while you can change who is the lead character, its a long ways into the game before you get that ability, or any control over your party for that matter. this wouldnt be a major issue in my opinion however, if it werent for my next con.\nthe biggest con in this game is that you cant save your party configurations. this means that anytime you change out party members, you also have to re-setup all your paradigm settings. because of this, i generally found my self sticking with one group configuration whenever possible and continuously refining my paradigms and strategies with that one group rather than trading out characters and playing as all the different characters to take full advantage of their different character strengths and paradigms.\nall in all, yes this game is pretty different from the other final fantasies. but not really any more so than they are from each other.\n\nlike all final fantasies this game also has a fantastic story. in fact i would rate it among my favorites next to 9 and 10 as far as story goes. and while japanese voices is an option, i actually found the english voice actors to be very good in this one, with no memorable cringeworthy moments. the story is also serious and deals with some pretty down to earth emotions. the characters of lightning, hope, and sahz are some of the deepest and best developed characters in the entire series in my opinion. lightning even beat sqall in becoming my favorite protagonist of the series.\n\nsince this is a port, something has to be said for port quality. shortly after release, they released an update to allow higher resolutions. however, there are still some issues, which i dont expect to be fixed at this point, regarding that update, particularily one involving scan notes that keeps me from taking full advantage of it. for some reason, on my machine anyways, any resolution above 1280x800 causes the notes to disappear from the enemy details screen when using libra. this is especially problematic since, as i mentioned before, playing off your enemies strengths and weaknesses is an important part of the battle system in this game. most importantly, the summon battles become practically unwinnable without some critical information that is provided in those notes.\n\nthat said, even playing at 1280x720 on my 1080p monitor, the graphics are surprisingly good, impressive even, and the scaling is hardly noticable. even though for me, most other games ive played are almost unbearable at such low resolutions. ive also only very rarely noticed any of the frame rate issues or lag that most other people complain about so excessively.\nlast but not least, and perhaps most surprising, the mouse and keyboard controls are good. and i dont just mean for a port, but good in general. its unfortunate that they didnt stick with these controls for the pc ports of xiii-2 and LR. i'll probably have to find some way to get a controller working for those before i can get more into them. but as for this game, well, i was fully intending to play this game with a controller like every other final fantasy id ever played, but i started a game without setting it up at first just to see how it ran and try it out really quick and not only was i completely satisfied, i was very impressed with the pc keyboard and mouse control sceme they came up with. in fact, i played the whole game through using mouse and keyboard. its easily the most satisfying ported controls of any ported game ive played on pc. other ports need to take some notes on this one. very dissappointed that xiii-2 and LR didnt follow suit.\n\noverall, this game was very enjoyable for me and i highly recommend it for anyone whos interested in jrpgs.","March 11","true","203.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You can force a few graphical settings through Nvidia Control Panel or AMD Catalyst though.)\n(Update - It seems a lot of people have problems with game looking really bad. I recommended it originally because the game looked nice on my end without any tweaking but it seems to be not the case for everyone. If you don't mind trying to tweak the settings in Nvidia Control Panel or AMD Catalyst, the game can look really good and I do recommend it but otherwise I definitely say you should wait for a patch to the game before buying. A Square Enix developer said they are looking into adding more resolution options and potentially more graphical options. Until then, I don't recommend it unless you don't mind playing with Nvidia Control or AMD Catalyst settings which may or may not work for everyone.)\n\nFor me, I used Nvidia Control Panel, go to "Manage 3D Settings" and click the "Program Settings" tab and click "Add" and select "Final Fantasy XIII" (and make sure it is selected when you are changing the settings, "don't use the mousewheel" as you may accidentally move to other programs).\n\nIt seems the major settings which help is to set "Texture filtering - Negative LOD bias" to "Allow" and "Anisotrpic filtering" to "16x" (or at least 4x) and "Anisotropic sample optimization" to "Off". A few other options is "Power Manager Mode - Prefer maximum performance" (this should fix FMV stuttering in case you have it). A few other settings that may help are "Antialiasing - FXAA" to "On", "Antialiasing - Setting" to the highest values. "Antialiasing - Mode" to "Override any application settings". "Texture filtering - High Quality".\n\nIt seems the major setting though is make sure "Texture filtering - Negative LOD bias" is set to "Allow" and "Anisotropic sample optimization" set to "Off". Try playing with the settings in Nvidia Control Panel or AMD Catalyst to see if any of those settings help. Those are the settings I use and the game looks great.\n\nDue to a lot of potential settings fiddling, I don't recommend the game yet until Square-Enix releases more graphical options, which a developer said they are looking into. The main issue though is the lack of resolution settings and borderless windowed mode (plus sound settings).\n\n(If you don't mind it and really want to play FFXIII, you can fiddle with the settings and the game can look great but I still recommend you wait for an official patch for the game before buying, especially if it is your first time playing it since it'll be best to wait until FFXIII is at its best before trying.)\n\n(Older Review Below.)\n\nA few important things to know before buying and/or playing the game:\n\n1. The PC port is bare but if you want to play FFXIII and don't have a console, it's decent and playable.\n\nThere is no borderless windowed mode (only just one regular windowed mode which you can't resize). You also can't set the resolution or change any display settings besides full screen and windowed. Game is also locked to 1280x720 resolution but the devs said they are looking into it and potentially add a patch to allow scaling to other resolutions.\n\nMy monitor and desktop resolution is natively at 1920x1080 and the game still looks fairly decent at 1280x720 (my Nvidia control settings is set to scale full screen games in Aspect Ratio mode under "Adjust desktop size and position" settings, for those with Nvidia cards - So the game plays without black borders).\n\n2. The PC version really lacks a lot of customization settings. For example, you can only change a few keybinds (not all of them). You can't change certain keybinds like the cancel button (it's Backspace my default and it seems you can't change it). This is sort of a big deal since you'll be using the cancel button a lot (going out of menus, going out of the map, etc), so you'll have to get used to using that key a lot. Also, don't accidentally press esc or you will exit the game without any confirmation.\n\nUpdate - I noticed you can use the mouse. I set "H" to Pause" and "T" to "View Enemy Intel" and "Tab" for Paradigm Shift / use Shrouds. "Open Area Map" is set to "4" (these are settings under Keyboard config in game). With Mouse, I can use WASD for movement + Cursor and "left click" for "confirm" and "right click" for cancel and I can use the mouse for camera.\n\nI highly recommend playing the game with a controller but I have gotten used to the keyboard controls after 2 hours of play, so even if you don't have a controller it's not too bad (just don't accidentally press "Esc" or else it exits the game without saving). Most of the keys can be rebound though. The keys you can't rebind are the camera (Numberpad), the cancel button (Backspace), the confirm button (Enter), movement (WASD), and cursor (arrow keys or WASD).\n\nBesides that, the game really runs well and I haven't really noticed any problems. Just a few things to note (you can get used to the keyboard controls easily but it does take some time to get used to).\n\nIt is a bare bones port but I haven't noticed any errors and the frame rate is smooth for me, so it is playable.\n\nMy computer specs are:\nWindows 7\nIntel Core i5-3750k\n8GB RAM\nGTX 750TI\n\nNow on to the game itself:\n\n3. It is recommended you set the default battle command to "Ability" and not "Auto-Battle" (under settings).\n\nWhile this won't make the game that much deeper, it can make the gameplay a lot more interactive and fun if you input the commands manually rather than selecting Auto-Battle. Of course there are times when you can use Auto-Battle and it can remove the tedium of having to manually select or use abilities (especially later in the game or when you just want to apply a bunch of debuffs quickly). For most cases though, it is definitely a lot more fun (especially in the early game when there's not as many abilities) if you select the abilities manually rather than using Auto-Battle.\n\nPersonally this made the game a lot more fun for me.\n\n4. The game is really linear and there's almost no customization until near the very end of the game. You only control one character at once and you cannot switch between characters mid battle (FFXIII-2, you can switch between characters mid battle but you still only control one at a time). Plus, you only have two characters with you for the majority of the game and you are limited to three paradigm roles per character for most of the game too. Finally, while the summons are visually impressive in this game, they are really impractical to use and aren't all that viable in the majority of battles (at most, you can get a few free attacks in but it's nothing like the previous Final Fantasy games where you can use summons as much as you want). There are a few viable strategies involving summons later in the game but it still isn't as fun or usable as in the previous Final Fantasy games.\n\nHowever, if you don't mind the above and if you are are prepared for lots of cutscenes and dialogue, then you'll probably enjoy the game. I've known about this before I played FFXIII and I definitely enjoyed the game a lot despite those facts.\n\nNear the end of the game, there are a lot of optional bosses and enemies you can fight and there's a bit more customization. Plus, the battles (some of them) are a lot fun and fast paced too.\n\nTaking note of the above - If the linearity of the game, lack of customization, and the numerous amount of cutscenes don't scare you away, then you'll probably enjoy the game. It is around a 20-40 hour game (20 hour game if you skip all the optional stuff near the end of the game) and it is probably over a 70 hour game if you want to get all the achievements and fight all the optional bosses as well as max out all accessories and ultimate weapons.","October 9, 2014","false","106.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

The J-RPG genre went astray. Completed straight when it first came out in 360, but I can't continue further this time:\n\n--Little to no spoilers--\n\n-Flat and childish characters (Sazh is the only credible man in the game, and he still is a worse version of Barret -background, story and battle wise).\n\n-Super convoluted story. S-E "tryharded" too much and ended with a bunch of nonsense premises.\n\n-0 difficulty and near to 0 customization makes this game boring. If you die you can restart right before the battle, the character stat/skills development is castrated and unlocks progressively because narrative reasons. No random battles, but level programmed -and easily avoidable- battles instead. You don't even need to shop until you are 30 hours into the game, etc...\n\n-Poor level design in terms of gameplay. Long corridors with short branches that always lead you to treasures.\n\n-Eidolons and weapons. Everything in this damn game is a Transformer. That's one of the worst ideas I've ever seen, not in a FF, but the entire RPG genre. The game suffers from that. "-Hey guys, what about the MC wears a blade? -Hey, better, what about a compact gun-blade? And Odin can morph into a horse too! EPIC!".\n\n-Combat is dynamic, but repetitive and unrewarding. The stagger system brings something but it isn't enough.\n\n-The class system in this game is done badly. There is no Physical class and Magic class, just non-elemental mixed attacker and elemental mixed attacker. Then there is a full healer, full tank, full support and full disrupter.\n\n-PRESSING "ESC" BUTTON CLOSES THE GAME. FOR REAL? I MEAN, F-O-R R-E-A-L.\n\nThere's a bunch of things i won't criticize because I tilt too much; let's talk about the goodies.\n\n+Beautiful grapichs, even now they are somewhat charming and impressive. Nice scenarios, good character face details. I don't like the context nor the futuristic setting, but that is too personal to be relevant.\n\n+The OST fitted the game perfectly and has some of the best tracks of the series and pretty much every theme is enjoyable. He's not Nobuo Uematsu, but Masashi Hamauzu performed.\n\n+If you survive the early and mid game, the game becomes not-so-terrible. Some sidequests and challenging battles open in the majestic Gran Pulse.\n","October 10, 2014","false","52.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tardivex/recommended/292120/","tardivex","Tardivex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tardivex/","839 products in account","It's definetly hard to be concise on such a controversial game, it's basically split, a lot of people like it, a lot of people hate it, I'd say I'm somewhere in the middle, but I think it's at least worth a shot. So here are my thoughts on Final Fantasy XIII, I think this will be a bit long, but I'll keep it spoiler free so you shouldn't worry about that. Also for those wondering about the PC port specifically it's gonna be in the last few paragraphs.\n\n\n>> STORY AND PRESENTATION <<\n\nThe presentation is absolutely gourgeous, there are some great looking enviroments and the music is really good aswell with some really iconic tracks that you'll probably remember even after you play the game. The story is definetly huge, about 40-70 hours long depending on your playstyle and some people may find it complex, but you can really pick up easily, it's only a bit confusing in the start but if you're paying attention and reading the Data Logs which were surprisingly nice to read and explain / sets up and foreshadows some things really well you should be just fine.\n\nI think the problem here for most people are the characters, they really have some uhm... Quirks I suppose that people might not enjoy, like Vanille for instance, I can definetly see her not appealing to a western audience just by the way she speaks, and in combination with Hope's mopeyness it can get annoying, I will say that I think I have a higher tolerance for that sorta stuff, but it builds into some great moments for these two characters in the middle of the game and you can really see how these characters develop. The rest of the group is fine in my opinion, however I think Lighning needed more development...\n\nI am trying to avoid spoilers here but I'll say that a bit past the midway point of the game the story starts falling apart a bit, like an issue that a character already went through and grew upon is brought back and it seems like it's a step backwards and just repeating the same thing again but with much less effect, and the whole overarching goal is kinda lost, so the characters are just wandering around doing whatever, which doesn't help it one bit, but then the goal's randomly back, so it definetly seems like this point in between that, having no goal, is just to pad out the game's length more than anything, this arc I'm talking about here is about Chapter 10 and 11, they definetly could've been handled better, and honestly because of them they sorta set the game up for a trainwreck, which could've been fixed mind you in Chapter 12 and 13, the last chapters, but the ending is just really bad.\n\nRemember what I said about the Data Logs before and how they were good at explaining and setting things up? Yeah well the end chapter completely forgot that and it seems to just make stuff up as it goes along, manufacturing the most convoluted and unescessary plot holes in the game, plus they went for the generic happy / everything's alright ending but they handled it very poorly and left a lot of unexplained stuff. I think overall the journey IS worth it, but I think the last chapters will leave you a bit dissapointed because of what it could've been.\n\n\n>> GAME MECHANICS <<\n\nOn the mechanical side of things the combat is a bit simplifyed, It's turn based but you can basically use the "auto-battle" button throughout the entire game and not put that much thought into it, the most that you'll do is just switch to a healing role when you need it every now and then with the paradigm system but that's about it, there is some optional content which is much harder though, so you could go for that if you're looking for a challenge.\n\nThere's no level up system for your characters on this game, all you have is a linear upgrade web which uses points you earn by winning battles, but you can level up your equipment with materials you drop from monsters or buy from the shop, it's kind of a bad system in my opinion because you have to commit to one specific weapon just because of the sheer cost of upgrading, and there's no way to know that "X" sword is better when upgraded than "Y" sword, so you can end up wasting it and having an inferiour weapon, some people don't like it but I'd definetly say to just check out the wiki on this for optmal stuff, but you really shouldn't have to which is a problem.\n\nThe game is very linear, you just have one path for most of the game, there are some very small detours to get collectables but that's about it, the game opens up in Chapter 11, providing some side missions but sadly they just feel like busywork, it's just "Go to A and kill this monster" and you can't accept multiple missions at the same time so there's a LOT of running around, I did them all for completion's sake but I honestly recommend you just skip them and move on with the story, in which the game becomes linear again in Chapter 12\n\n\n>> PC PORT <<\n\nI've bought this game a few months after launch and from what I've seen of release day it's definetly improved quite a bit, it's definetly playable now and you can change the resolution, anti aliasing and shadow resolution now too without using a 3rd party software, there's not a whole lot of customization but it works\n\nI will say I experienced some frame drops in some areas of the game due to poor optimization and I hope it gets fixed with more patches, but it's not THAT frequent, and the majority of the game will run fine at 60 fps\n\nThe controls are fine because it's basically all menus, and the camera in the game is pretty good for the most part\n\n\n>> CONCLUSION <<\n\nFrom what I've said here you probably expect me to not recommend it and say that I hate this game, but for some weird reason despite all the flaws I found it very compelling, I don't know how to explain it exactly but I just wanted to play more and see how the story unfolded, it was interesting enough and the Data Logs were really interesting to read, also putting points into the crystarium felt satisfying somehow, plus even though it's simpler I still enjoyed the combat system, and there are some really challenging optional fights that you can go through that I found quite fun to beat.\n\nIn the end I just wanted more and more, and I think that's the reason I did all 64 side missions like a crazy maniac, hell I didn't even know you could go back and do them after you finished the game, so I did them all with an underpowered team, but it was really cool trying to find loopholes or strategies to beat these really hard enemies, some of which I shouldn't even really be fighting, and the soundtrack really helped make the experience that much better, and even though I didn't really like the final chapters I still felt satisfied with the journey overall and ended up wanting even more, I mean I'll even pick up the sequel and play that aswell because of this game\n\nSo to summarise... Final Fantasy XIII is not a masterpiece, but there's a LOT of content here, enough to keep you playing for at least 40 hours or even more than that, I genuelly think people should give this one at least a chance, grab it on sale if you're unsure about it, it'll probably be 75% off next time which will be very cheap, I think it's a compelling enough game that you'll end up enjoying at least on some level, but if you're really put off by the characters you will have a bad time, ultimately I think it's all about your level of tolerance for that kind of stuff or if you have any at all","January 16, 2015","true","60.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","4","7","3","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/tardivex/recommended/292120/","tardivex","Tardivex","http://steamcommunity.com/id/tardivex/","839 products in account","It's definetly hard to be concise on such a controversial game, it's basically split, a lot of people like it, a lot of people hate it, I'd say I'm somewhere in the middle, but I think it's at least worth a shot. So here are my thoughts on Final Fantasy XIII, I think this will be a bit long, but I'll keep it spoiler free so you shouldn't worry about that. Also for those wondering about the PC port specifically it's gonna be in the last few paragraphs.\n\n\n>> STORY AND PRESENTATION <<\n\nThe presentation is absolutely gourgeous, there are some great looking enviroments and the music is really good aswell with some really iconic tracks that you'll probably remember even after you play the game. The story is definetly huge, about 40-70 hours long depending on your playstyle and some people may find it complex, but you can really pick up easily, it's only a bit confusing in the start but if you're paying attention and reading the Data Logs which were surprisingly nice to read and explain / sets up and foreshadows some things really well you should be just fine.\n\nI think the problem here for most people are the characters, they really have some uhm... Quirks I suppose that people might not enjoy, like Vanille for instance, I can definetly see her not appealing to a western audience just by the way she speaks, and in combination with Hope's mopeyness it can get annoying, I will say that I think I have a higher tolerance for that sorta stuff, but it builds into some great moments for these two characters in the middle of the game and you can really see how these characters develop. The rest of the group is fine in my opinion, however I think Lighning needed more development...\n\nI am trying to avoid spoilers here but I'll say that a bit past the midway point of the game the story starts falling apart a bit, like an issue that a character already went through and grew upon is brought back and it seems like it's a step backwards and just repeating the same thing again but with much less effect, and the whole overarching goal is kinda lost, so the characters are just wandering around doing whatever, which doesn't help it one bit, but then the goal's randomly back, so it definetly seems like this point in between that, having no goal, is just to pad out the game's length more than anything, this arc I'm talking about here is about Chapter 10 and 11, they definetly could've been handled better, and honestly because of them they sorta set the game up for a trainwreck, which could've been fixed mind you in Chapter 12 and 13, the last chapters, but the ending is just really bad.\n\nRemember what I said about the Data Logs before and how they were good at explaining and setting things up? Yeah well the end chapter completely forgot that and it seems to just make stuff up as it goes along, manufacturing the most convoluted and unescessary plot holes in the game, plus they went for the generic happy / everything's alright ending but they handled it very poorly and left a lot of unexplained stuff. I think overall the journey IS worth it, but I think the last chapters will leave you a bit dissapointed because of what it could've been.\n\n\n>> GAME MECHANICS <<\n\nOn the mechanical side of things the combat is a bit simplifyed, It's turn based but you can basically use the "auto-battle" button throughout the entire game and not put that much thought into it, the most that you'll do is just switch to a healing role when you need it every now and then with the paradigm system but that's about it, there is some optional content which is much harder though, so you could go for that if you're looking for a challenge.\n\nThere's no level up system for your characters on this game, all you have is a linear upgrade web which uses points you earn by winning battles, but you can level up your equipment with materials you drop from monsters or buy from the shop, it's kind of a bad system in my opinion because you have to commit to one specific weapon just because of the sheer cost of upgrading, and there's no way to know that "X" sword is better when upgraded than "Y" sword, so you can end up wasting it and having an inferiour weapon, some people don't like it but I'd definetly say to just check out the wiki on this for optmal stuff, but you really shouldn't have to which is a problem.\n\nThe game is very linear, you just have one path for most of the game, there are some very small detours to get collectables but that's about it, the game opens up in Chapter 11, providing some side missions but sadly they just feel like busywork, it's just "Go to A and kill this monster" and you can't accept multiple missions at the same time so there's a LOT of running around, I did them all for completion's sake but I honestly recommend you just skip them and move on with the story, in which the game becomes linear again in Chapter 12\n\n\n>> PC PORT <<\n\nI've bought this game a few months after launch and from what I've seen of release day it's definetly improved quite a bit, it's definetly playable now and you can change the resolution, anti aliasing and shadow resolution now too without using a 3rd party software, there's not a whole lot of customization but it works\n\nI will say I experienced some frame drops in some areas of the game due to poor optimization and I hope it gets fixed with more patches, but it's not THAT frequent, and the majority of the game will run fine at 60 fps\n\nThe controls are fine because it's basically all menus, and the camera in the game is pretty good for the most part\n\n\n>> CONCLUSION <<\n\nFrom what I've said here you probably expect me to not recommend it and say that I hate this game, but for some weird reason despite all the flaws I found it very compelling, I don't know how to explain it exactly but I just wanted to play more and see how the story unfolded, it was interesting enough and the Data Logs were really interesting to read, also putting points into the crystarium felt satisfying somehow, plus even though it's simpler I still enjoyed the combat system, and there are some really challenging optional fights that you can go through that I found quite fun to beat.\n\nIn the end I just wanted more and more, and I think that's the reason I did all 64 side missions like a crazy maniac, hell I didn't even know you could go back and do them after you finished the game, so I did them all with an underpowered team, but it was really cool trying to find loopholes or strategies to beat these really hard enemies, some of which I shouldn't even really be fighting, and the soundtrack really helped make the experience that much better, and even though I didn't really like the final chapters I still felt satisfied with the journey overall and ended up wanting even more, I mean I'll even pick up the sequel and play that aswell because of this game\n\nSo to summarise... Final Fantasy XIII is not a masterpiece, but there's a LOT of content here, enough to keep you playing for at least 40 hours or even more than that, I genuelly think people should give this one at least a chance, grab it on sale if you're unsure about it, it'll probably be 75% off next time which will be very cheap, I think it's a compelling enough game that you'll end up enjoying at least on some level, but if you're really put off by the characters you will have a bad time, ultimately I think it's all about your level of tolerance for that kind of stuff or if you have any at all","January 16, 2015","true","60.4"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","57","4","7","3","0"

Which the problem for me is... i didn't grind till the 5th chapter...But that made it alot harder for me to beat the chapter 6 boss... so that mistake went into me making a schedule for a whole day of grinding and focusing on the enemy attacks, which is hard for me since i forget most of the enemy attacks, which brings me onto the next point...\n\nENEMIES.WILL.THROW.EVERYTHING.AT.YOU! No matter if your ready or not, enemies will throw anything at you which makes it really hard to remember there order of attacks. Why? Because the order is random. (At least for me) So if you want to remember every single attack, welp good luck, as this can take Hours upon end... Believe me, i almost ripped my hair because of one boss... so that was very painful for my head and now that im saying this it just tells that i may be a little bit crazy... ANYWAY!\n\nInstead of talking about the main game... Lets talk about the parts that are good, or just awful...\n\n\n+Soundtrack is just amazing, when your not battling, the music is very peaceful.\n+When you get junk from enemies (cloth, tears, etc...) You can go to the same save station and upgrade weapons and little accessories you can find in little floating bubbles. (The upgrade station is later on in the game while the items are already there)\n+There are weapons and accessories that are either very useful, useless, powerful or just plain crap\n+Bosses are a neat little challenge, so are some smaller enemies and mini bosses\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n-Battle system is kinda weird to use for me personally, for you it might be good or the same like me\n-One enemy in a chapter is so hard to beat that even the GAME warns you about him, but there right, STAY AWAY UNLESS YOU HAVE A GOOD WAY OF BEATING HIM!\n\n\nThats all i have to write, so here's my little tip (as a bonus ^^)\n\nStay away from this game if you dont have alot of time for it, or dont have the money. otherwise, buy it. its fun!","April 13","true","12.2"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

That's like the most basic thing I expected from a port. Had low expectations and still disappointed. You just have to get used to the controls they have mapped on your gamepad. It works nice on xbox controller, but on other type it gets a bit awkward. Controls on keyboard is okay. But if you're like me, and accidentally tap Esc on reflex to open the menu every now and then, then it gets quite stressful when you accidentally exit the game when you don't intend to.\n\nNot recommending this game at the moment. Probably later when they patch or someone else come up with something to cope with this problem. But I guess if you need something outside official stuff to run the game properly, that still makes it a terrible release.\n\nBut if you think 15 bucks is worth all the trouble, or if you just need to get it over with because its Final Fantasy, by all means go for it.","October 12, 2014","false","30.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/biidi/recommended/292120/","biidi","Biidi","http://steamcommunity.com/id/biidi/","261 products in account","So, I haven't seriously played a Final Fantasy game since 10-2. Played 11 for a few months and 12 for a short time. I thought that 13 would be a good way to get back into the series, especially since it's now on Steam and I haven't had a console for a long time.\n\nThe graphics in the game (as you'd expect from a modern Final Fantasy game) are breathtaking. All you have to do is look at the screenshots above and imagine those in motion. The visuals aren't a problem one bit. However, the graphical STABILITY is. Even after the patch in December that added "graphics options" it still doesn't even run at a stable 30 fps. Combat often dropped down below 20 for me. I know, a lot of people think 30 is "unplayable", but this isn't a fast-paced fps. It's not smooth, but it is easily playable.\n\nThe size of the game on my drive is the biggest reason I nearly didn't buy this. 60 gig? WTF are they loading? Turns out, they didn't do 1 video stream and 2 audio streams. That 60 gig is because you are forced to download both English and Japanese cutscenes whether you want both or not.\n\nCombat is mostly fast-paced semi-real-time action. You control only one character (and it takes at least 20 hours into the game before you're allowed to change your combat party) while the other two are controlled by the computer based on the roles you give them. This works out reasonably well since you only need to focus on the actions of one character, though you still have to babysit the other two. Early game combat doesn't really prepare you for later on. Early combat is basically 'press Auto combat to win'. This lasts for 20+ hours. Occasionally there's a boss where you need to use a little bit of strategy.\n\nMy biggest gripes with the game are the extreme linearity and the horrific grind-fest the game turns into. Once you get to Gran Pulse it looks like the game opens up! I was so excited! Big open areas with monsters for me to fight or avoid as I saw fit. Five minutes later I'm being railroaded through canyons and narrow walkways again.\n\nThis is also about where it turns into a grind-fest. Shortly before getting to Gran Pulse it unlocks all the roles for each character. You might be thinking that it allows for more variety and customization, which it does, if you're willing to pay a hefty cost for. The first skill in one of the three 'secondary' roles costs 3000 cp (or whatever the points are called) while the final one in the first tier costs 48000. In contrast, the skills for the main roles top off at 8000 for tier 3.\n\nThis isn't even mentioning weapon upgrading which is probably just as bad if not worse. Each character has what appears to be only about a dozen weapons. You have 4 basic ones which you upgrade and transform into the second level weapons which you upgrade and transform into their final version. For example, I was using the Axis Blade for Lightning. It would take about 23000 points to upgrade it fully. It's secondary form takes 367000, and the final form takes 1.6 million. Doesn't sound too bad until you realize that most upgrade items give less than 100 points each. Even with the multipliers it still would take a hell of a long time.\n\nSo anyway, my verdict on FF13: Ruined a decent movie by trying to make it a game.","February 10, 2015","false","33.5"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","56","5","9","2","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047384109/recommended/292120/","76561198047384109","VTXShiva","http://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198047384109/","124 products in account","Before I start this review, I will let you know I'm addicted to this game and series for various reasons, so expect moderate to high level of bias. I will try my best to explain WHY i enjoyed it because there are a lot of things that this game does well and you the reader will be able to gouge if it is something you would fancy or not.\n\nStory: good and bad The game has a strong well developed story.\nThe main story and narative is quite complex and it does a lot of reminiscing and going back and forth between past and present. I found this enjoyable as it replicated to a small scale how we often remember specific moments from the past in different situations. It's not just that the game flings you into flashbacks, it does it when it generally makes sense. One of the characters is going through a specific conflict or hardship, here's a flashback letting you know how some of those feelings and thoughts came to be. It adds to the experience, not detracts from it.\nThat being said, I've heard a lot of people complaining about this and I can see why some did not like it. There's a lot to keep track of and the number of cutscenes and flashbacks is quite high. If you're not on the ball, the story can become complicated and convoluted really fast. You NEED to pay attention to it, it's not spoon fed to you.\n\nThere are also special entries in the datalog section explaining various aspects of the world. These are small pieces of text regarding locations, characters, deities folklore and more. These offer quite a bit of information about the world but it's not for everyone.\nIf you're the kind of person who likes reading books in Skyrim in addition to talking to people it's great, if you dont' care for it, it sucks. And the bad thing about this is that a reasonable amout of information, especially in the later part of the game, is only really explained in these entries.\nBear in mind however that these are only added information to make the world richer, it's not really needed to experience the story. You don't really need to know how NORA came to be or what each Fal'Cie's function is, but it's fullfilling to know a little more.\n\nCharacters: Really good Personally i found them realistic and sometimes annoyingly so. Most complaints people have tend to partake to Hope a very very young boy going through some very turbulent times and emotions and Vanille, a character with a ton of internal conflicts. Both of these character often annoyed the people who played the game, myself included: Hope can be extremely whiny and Vanille seems to be a walking oximoron with so much double-think it makes your head spin.\nAnd that's fine! As you progress through the story and understand more and more about the characters, the world and their situation, it starts making sense and you warm up to them. While avoiding spoilers it's important to note that the characters are thrust into a situation that is pretty much "Us versus the entire world". In such a setting, where everyone you meet can turn a handshake into a potential knife at your throat, these conflicting and often irrational behaviors are "normal" or at least expected and plausible. I really can't stress this enough. The story is heavy and it doesn't tell you how to feel, you have to put in a bit of effort to understand it. But once you do, it is oh so rewarding.\n\nGameplay: A rough diamond, no exagerationAs someone who works in Games QA, I didn't get to play a game with a system as rewarding as XIII's. From a design point it's so great I could talk about it for weeks on end, but i will try to keep it as short as possible.\nThe basics are very simple to pick up and understand. Use elemental magic and attacks (Ravager) to stagger enemies ( staggered enemies take more damage and in various cases become weak to a few or more types of attacks) use non-aspected attacks and magic (Commando) to deal tons of damage. Use buffs and Debuffs to take less damage or deal more. Straight forward, easy to pick up. The beauty of the system is its depth however. There are so many ways to defeat enemies it's hard to describe. The intersectionality between item functionality, abilities, buffs and debuffs allows for countless customization. But that's not all. There are a lof of small aspects that can easily go unnoticed as well.\n\nEvery character has unique animations for its attacks which makes some characters exceptionally strong in specific scenarios. Snow for instance has a very fast casting animation, while Sazh Blitz ability is a hail of bullets resulting in multiple smaller attacks. Even abilities themselves have shorter/longer animations or impact timers. Switching between paradigms gives you an ATB refresh if done correctly which reduces downtime between attacks for instance. Learning these small secrets adds a whole new dynamic to how you perform in battle. A 5 minute fight can suddenly become a 30 second stomp simply by using the right abilities and aproach. In this sense the game is more about understanding the system and less so about the actual execution. You don't need fast reflexes or specific timings most of the time.\n\nDifficulty: Very easy, very boring or very frustratingBecause of what i also mentioned above the difficulty can vary drastically. There are some tactics that will work on most enemies and encounters, making it very boring to go through when you can just repeat one patern to win.\nUsing said patterns can be very frustrating however when you fight some of the mobs that require more unorthodox approaches. All of a sudden you find yourself hitting a brick wall because you didn't explore the system enough. The combat mechanic is designed so that you abuse the various enemies weaknesses, and some of them don't flaunt their weaknesses on their sleeves. Once you understand the system and the enemies, the game becomes almost trivial. There are only a handfull of enemies that can be considered hard and none of them amount to anything you would call a superboss, unless you intentionally go there unprepared in which case they can be devastating.\n\nMusic: It's a Final Fantasy gameHonestly, that's all you need to know. Like every other game in the series, Final Fantasy XIII has a beautiful soundtrack.\nIf you're familiar with the series you won't be dissapointed, if you're new to it, you will likely end up loving it.\n\nVoice over: Play it in english, no reallyThis game is one of few "foreign" games i would actually recommend playing in English. The main reasoning behind this is because there are several characters that don't feel, look or act asian/japanese. Sazh is a clear example of this. Aside from some hickups on Vanille's part where she sometimes switches accents, (she and Fang are not from the same "world" as the rest of the characters so the accent may be intentional) the english VO fits the characters and their personalities.\n\nLinear Gameplay vs. Open World The vast majority of the game is linear. Others have said it and it bears repeating. If you like your RPGs westernized with tons of exploration, XIII isn't the game you're looking for. The game only opens up late into the playthrough, chapter 11 to be specific. Even then, the exploration aspect is minimal and most of the available optional content is mission/quest based where you're only tasked to kill monsters. However i find this also a strong point. It makes missing items/objectives less of an issue. If you like unlocking all achievements on a game, or want to do it for the first time, this game is a fairly good place to start. Not too easy to "plat" not too hard.\n\nVerdictAll in all i would definitely recommend this game to the right people. It's a good game and it gets a lot of things right, but while I say that, i must also admit that some of its strengths can also be its weaknesses.","April 14, 2015","true","136.2"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","2"

Works great in 720p no frame stutter anymore, and overall the proper experience that should have been able to be played at launch. For whatever reason, any time I go beyond 720p and increase shadow detail, the framerate starts to do the stutter a bit but not quite as bad. In the cutscenes it is definitely noticable, so Square-Enix you still have some work to do.\n\nI already know people will say, "Oh it's your system, your graphics card sucks, etc." Which ok, if that was the case, why is it I can play Skyrim on Ultra 1080p no problem? BF4 Ultra no problem? Just this game has problems...? Yeah so it's not me, it's Square Enix who needs to do some more work on their PC port. It even states on some systems that if you bump up the resolution your game can freeze/crash. So don't give me the "It's your system" crap. Square-Enix you've done ok so far, but you still have a ways to go before this is the definitive port of the bunch.\n\nOld review as of first release:\n\nWhile I'll agree with everyone that this is a dodgy PC port, if you love the game I still recommend getting it. Hopefully the visuals will be patched for max potential 1080p or higher, and the frame stutter will be fixed. The frame stutter is noticable in game and if it really bothers you then I guess don't pick this up. I however love this game and I am willing to at least put up with an annoyance to play through this game again.\n\nAnother bonus is getting the option of Japanese and English audio, which apparently the console versions didn't give you an option to choose (I didn't mind the English voice acting so I never bothered to look up a Japanese alternate). Overall, if you are a fan of this game, if you want it bad enough you'll buy it and probably put up with it's problems for now, but hopefully we will get a patch to fix the game. Other than what I mentioned the game plays fine for me. No crashing, black screen, etc.","October 13, 2014","true","15.6"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

And boy, does it deserve it!\nIt does some things well, some things are okay and a bunch of'em very bad, which leaves a taste sweet and sour at the time.\n\nThe story starts slow, not knowing what's happening besides there are baddies out there and they wanna kill you. As you progress the history, everything starts unravelling in two timelines, the days before the first one (when you start playing) and in the present (by moving the story forward). It gets quite chaotic sometimes but nothing a quick read on the Datalog cannot repair. As boring and bad was the beginning, I think it changed up to good. From "we bad you good" it changed more into a grey-ish tone at the end, were you cannot feel but think "Damn. He had a point.".\n\nThe visuals are stunning, but I've a hard-one for this kind of art, so take that with a pinch of salt. The game suffers for some low level textures that don't mesh well with some of the high res one. For example, in some upclose scenes of Ligthning, everything is detailed but the grip from her gunblade isn't. Maybe it was a problem with my own system but damn.\n\nThe music delivers, as expected from a FF title even though it wasn't composed by our dear Nobuo Uematsu. If you're curious to hear some of the best tracks of the title. you can google "Born Anew" (Watch out for the spoilers!) "Blinded by Light" or the heavier "Snow's Theme".\n\nAaaand the gameplay department. The most controversial of things. In this game, you can only control your main character (that you can change and it's useful to do it due to special skills of each character) and the other ones will act accord a role you have set up (Damage dealer, debuffer, healer, tank...). It starts slow due to not having too much options/party members, but boy it does well later on! You have to constantly switch paradigms to react and adapt or fail on your quest.\n\nFinally, as a port? It sucks so hard ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s could do a series with it. I mean, pressing ESC in fullscreen closes the game without a warning! WTF SE?\nGet Durante's GeDoSaTo and fix it by downsampling (game's locked at 720p in vanilla) and having 60FPS.\n\nIn the end? Worth the 10 euros. I beat it on 35 hours (story) and farmed a bunch outside of Steam and started doing sidequests. Game clocks at 90 right now and have to still beat the hardest optional bosses.\nAlready had beaten it on X360 so had an advantage on some encounters and what-to-do. Even if it was a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port, the PC community always stands up.\n\nPros:\n\n·Stunning visuals and music\n·Interesting gameplay and difficulty\n\nCons:\n\n·Longass tutorial (Pretty much 10 hour long)\n·Doesn't feel like the old FF games without a big space to travel around besides an area you unlock later in the game. No overworld map, city visit...\n·Such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port. God bless Durante for fixing it!","November 10, 2014","true","35.0"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

For this price there is 40+ hours minimum of gameplay . With cool graphics 720p as they where on concoles , and keybord and mouse countrolls ( I recommend a controller) , wich are partly customizable. All in all it`s a very good looking Final Fantasy game ON PC !!! Wich is wicked already , cause back at the days i coudnt even imagine having FF on PC. And having it on steam is amazing ! FF13 is a turn based RPG with a lot CG cutscenes , amazing and touching story and cool machanics that i like a whole lot !\n\nFor those who played on a concole , there will be mostly nothing new for you here , except for window mode ( that I am using )  and keybord/mouse  controls . For most part i have spotted that there were less frame drops than on Xbox and the picture lookes better cause on a 47 inch plasma pixels where always there , while on my 17inch laptop it looks much better .\n\nTo summ it up , it`s a simple port of a concole ONLY game without graphics settings that most PC games have but never the less , if dont have a concole and like Final fantasy series this is a game for you . MOST IMPORTANTLY : I havent encounter any of the FPS drops that are ONLY on this port , cause there were many drops on Xbox too and it didnt hinder my gameplay at all .\n9/10 from me . No game is perfect and never will there be such a game .\n\nFor all those who write negative reviews i will remind you that this game is the same as Dark Souls it is a PORT( and there are very few of those) ! And we are lucky to have it at this price ! I personaly am very thankfull for this PORT as i was with dark souls . I would like to have such games as God of War or other Gears of war on PC even if those would be PORTS .\nThank you for you attention.\nGood luck and don't suck !","October 10, 2014","true","51.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zjarcal/recommended/292120/","Zjarcal","Zjarcal","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Zjarcal/","394 products in account",""It gets good later" is a rather common phrase used with a lot of games that start rather slow. FFXIII though takes that premise to the extreme. It does get good later, but it forces you to go through an entire game's worth of (bad) content before it starts getting interesting.\n\nI was actually all set to quit the game at around the 12-13 or so hour mark, and I only forced myself to go on because of a quote from another review regarding the game's characters, which read "these are all winning characters". Considering how bad they had been till that point, I couldn't bring myself to understand how anyone would say that, so I decided to force myself to go on just to see.\n\nWell... I'm actually really glad I did, because eventually they did become winning characters, but for the love of all that's good and holy in this world, did it take FOREVER for them to get interesting. The same goes for the main story itself and the gameplay.\n\nSee, the main issue with the game is pacing, it's just awful at pacing itself properly. The game is padded with filler to the extreme, which is already an issue in and of itself, but when combined with a "in medias res" beggining that does a terrible job at explaining the basic premise to the player, well, it makes for the most mind bogglingly bad (loooooong) intro to a (eventually good) game ever.\n\nIt doesn't help at all that the game is linear to the extreme. I don't mind linearity in and of itself, it's fine when it's delivering the right notes at the right times, but again, with the pacing of the game being practically dead for so long, the linearity sticks out like a sore thumb.\n\nThe game got interesting for me at chapter 7 (of 13, so yeah, about halfway through), it's where all the characters finally started showing proper develoment, the story finally started making sense, and the gameplay itself also finally became a little bit more than just spamming the auto battle key (it never really becomes anything noteworthy imo though, even if it can be fun).\n\nIt's funny to say now that I actually love all the characters, considering how much I didn't care for them at first, but I really do love them now, Fang and Vanille in particular, who were more central to the plot than the "official" main character Lightning herself. Fang is super awesome from the moment she's introduced, though Vanille is quite the opposite, terrible at first (like all the others), but once her character and motivations are expanded, she gets interesting and likable, not to mention that she eases up a bit on the uber annoying kookiness.\n\nThe rest of the cast also deserves praise though, Sazh, Hope, Snow, they all get very good development (eventually...) and it was easy for me to root for all of them by the end. Ironically, Lightning was the least developed character, never really becoming that interesting, though she was likable enough.\n\nThe main story itself, once it finally came together and I was able to understand what the hell was going on (reading the datalog is mandatory since the game doesn't bother explaining vital details), it became quite good, not a masterpiece by any means, but definitely entertaining. The ending though, now THAT was a masterpiece imo. It's without a doubt now one of my favorite endings, a perfect mix of bittersweet and joy, with clear closure. I kinda don't even want to bother with the sequels because of it, I like for stories to end on a high note and just leave it there, and this was as high a note as it could possibly achieve, no need to mess up with that.\n\nSince the story and characters are what made me love this game, I won't really go into that much detail about the gameplay, especially since I don't even feel there's much to go on about. Combat is sorta a hybrid of turn based and real time, with the action happening in real time but individual actions only being possible when a gauge fills up.\n\nFor the most part you don't really need to think a lot during battles, the autobattle system chooses the most optimal actions for the character to execute. Only thing that really demands your attention is healing and the paradigm system introduced later on, in which characters can switch classes midway through a battle. It's actually a nice system, feels like you're playing coach to the team during combat, but it's still not the most engaging thing out there.\n\nLastly, one thing that gets mentioned a lot is how the game stops being linear at chapter 11. Well it's true sorta, you get an open area where you can do lots of "side quests", which are just more battles, though some of the more interesting battles take place here. However, considering how late in the game that area comes up, at that point not only was I already exhausted from the combat, the story was also nearing its climax, the last thing I wanted to do was take a massively long break from it, so eh, don't really care much for that area.\n\nFinally, the game is gorgeous to look at and an absolute joy to listen as it has a FANTASTIC soundtrack. Hell, when I was first all set to quit the game early, I actually consoled myself on at least having gotten a great soundtrack out of it.\n\nAnyway, to sum it up, I ended up loving the game even if it did everything in its power to make me hate it. If you're gonna give it a try, I warn you, you better be patient.\n\nEDIT: Right, forgot to mention the PC port issues, but then those have been discussed to death already, no graphics options, 720p res, 60gb install, etc. At least the port had the decency to show keyboard controls properly, not like I haven't seen other ports still showing console controls... :/","October 17, 2014","true","50.5"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","3"

If you don't like to play 720p upscaled or don't like to tinker with the game and use mods then don't buy this game right now cos you will be very disappointed. This game needs some fixing and tinkering from fans before it comes playable and enjoyable atm sadly. Other than fullscreen mode and windowed mode there are no other graphic options available without modding so that's a bummer.\n\nBut thanks to Durante and GeDoSaTo now we can render the game in 1080p and must say it looks friggin beautiful in 1080p with AA at 8. If you are going to play this checking out GeDoSaTo is a must http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/  This is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played.\n\nStory gets interesting after around 10 hours or so & if you are gonna give up before that I urge you not to. Gameplay is linear but its acceptable and somewhat enjoyable, would've liked to have the opportunity to interact with the surroundings more since this is a rpg. Characters are a mixed bag for me as Lightning is very interesting, Sazh is somewhat interesting and rest is well not that much interesting so far tbh, not gonna spoil the whole game explaining why. Combat system will take some time to get used to but once you starts to master it, it will become fun trust me.\n\nThe cut scenes my god they look really beautiful considering they are from 2009 and from a console game(no offense console users), would've preferred the H.264 cut scenes from the PS3 version as bink is outdated and if you look really closely you can see the pixels in very few videos sadly, specially when upscaled to 1080p. Download size is whooping 49.4gb thanks to the international version being dual audio with both Japanese and English audio so before buying might wanna look into that if you cannot download that much data.\n\nOverall if you are a fan of JRPG and turn based combat games go for it as for 15 bucks you are not gonna loose that much. Beautiful world (with mods ofc), huge and very interesting story, great music, somewhat good characters that you will start to like more you play, good voice acting in both languages(except for Vanile in English, she's a disaster :/ ), somewhat okay port so justifiable for 15 bucks.

I could write paragraphs about this, but instead i'll just sum it up like this:\n\n- The game is ridiculously linear for much of it's duration\n- It feels like a very long tutorial before the "real" gameplay actually begins\n- The story is confusing and very poorly told early on, and only really makes sense as time passes\n- If you can slog past the first crappy hours of this game, it gets better eventually\n- The PC Port is ♥♥♥♥♥\n\nAll of these things turned out to be true.\n\nIt took me a month to beat this game for two reasons. First I got embroiled in a very nasty conflict in ARK Survival Evolved that required alot of my time and attention before it was settled to my satisfaction, and second playing anymore than an hour or two of this ♥♥♥♥ing game during it's early parts was just too much for me. Also I played in only in offline mode so I wouldn't be harassed by friends wondering why I was playing this known "terrible" game, and I can only really get away with that a few hours a day.\n\nI don't feel like typing a long review for this, so, much like I summed up what people have told me about this game over the years, I will do the same with my general thoughts:\n\n- I was bored out of my mind for large segments of the early game.\n- The battle system became kind of neat later on, but at first it felt like I wasn't even playing a game because of how little input was necessary.\n- The port annoyed me because I couldn't change the key bindings (or at least I never found out how).\n- I'm glad there is an "easy mode" setting for the battles because it means I was able to spend less time with them.\n- The art/graphics are pretty, and it is obvious even to people who haven't played this game that that is where most of the effort went.\n- The main characters eventually grew on me, but at first they were all either whiny, ♥♥♥♥♥♥s, or I didn't quite know enough about them yet to form a solid opinion. If I had to pick favorites, it would be Lightning and Fang, though Hope certainly had the most character development.\n- The running theme throughout the story about xenophobia and how it can lead to horrible things being done was actually a bit novel. It was probably one of the more interesting things that was going on story-wise.\n- I managed to play the game for extended periods of time without getting bored once the party was (finally) united and I was able to use strategy for battles and roam around maps that weren't completely linear. But this only happened about partway through Chapter 9... of 13. The stuff before that was either tolerable or boring.\n- Certainly the weakest FF game of the ones I have played and finished up until this point (7, 8, 10).\n- No, I will not be getting the rest of the achievements. ♥♥♥♥ grinding.\n\nSo... with all of that said, what do I say to this notoriously divisive game? Ehh.... I gave a negative review to Far Cry 4 yesterday and I generally had more fun with that than this. But unlike that, my expectations for this game were pretty damn low, so there was far less room for disappointment. I -knew- that this game would be pretty mediocre or bad for about half of its duration, and by now anybody who is considering looking into this will know that as well.\n\n"Maybe" isn't an option on Steam, so I'm going to blow everyone's mind and give this game a "Yes". Why? Not because it is a good game, because it isn't. I can't think of a better example of a game to point to and say "The devs really should have gotten people to play this and submit critique before they decided to release it". But by now, this game's reputation is pretty hard to avoid. If you are getting it, then you should know that you are in for a very long game that won't be very good (or good at all in some parts) for quite a few hours. But, eventually, it will end up being okay. Not great, but... okay. FF13 is not as bad as I was led to believe, but it's bad enough that I'm pretty sure I won't ever install it, much less play it, again.\n\nBesides, I hear the sequels are actually kinda good, and you do kinda need to play the first game in a series before moving on to those. Sadly, this is the reason why I still haven't played Witcher 2/3 yet. I bet somebody's jaw is dropping about the fact that I managed to get through FF13 before I got through Witcher 1. That amuses me.\n\nSo now I'm installing FF13-2. I'll get around to that eventually. If that turns out to be crap however, I may turn around and give this game a "no" review just to be spiteful or something.\n\nCan I go to sleep now?

Now with the PC port here and nearly 300 hours of experience (on the PS3) I can write with some leverage to you.\n\nGraphically, this game is pretty fantastic. Minus some pixelly textures on the sides of the environment, the backgrounds and everything else, spell visuals, weapon details and model textures are pretty high quality, very excellent in terms of a port that was released all the way back in 2010. If you're a fan of CGI, then FFXIII nails this part perfectly. It's pretty tough to judge the quality of this game's CGI when it pretty much looks like something out of real life.\n\nHowever, for the PC port of this game, this is where FFXIII falls apart here. There are MASSIVE issues with the port regarding FPS. It is very tough to get constant 60FPS everywhere, and for some this will be a massive downside, this was the case for me. Below this review, there are some performance tips that will make or break the game's performance for you. Try these out and see if your PC can achieve 60FPS for this game.\n\nDuring battles, the game dips to as low as 10FPS when switching paradigms, a form of switching classes mid battle to put it short-like. Aside from FPS issues, FFXIII offers a very indepth battle system that can get very intense against some of the toughest enemies this game as to offer.\n\nGameplay wise, ignoring all the technical difficulties, the game starts off by holding your hand and explaining what each option does for quite a bit, all the way up to Chapter 5 roughly. The pathways are often just a single path towards your goal, up until Chapter 11 when you reach the open world part. The Paradigm system is underestimated by a lot of people  - not many people choose to manually select their Abilities and just go for Auto Battle. My tip is to change the Default Command to Abilities instead of Auto Battle in the ingame settings menu.\n\nFInal Fantasy XIII is a beautiful game is that often underestimated by a massive majority of the public. If you appreciate visuals, a good JRPG, some bland humour (mostly Sazh's script) and of course, want to give yourself the chance to have a challenge, then I highly recommend this game to you.\n\n**PERFORMANCE TIPS**\n- People have been using a program called GeDoSaTo edit the ingame's graphical capabilties, lowering or increasing the resolution beyond 1080p, etc. (Google GeDoSaTo, find a link from github.\n\n- To achieve 60fps in the field, turning off the minimap can be a massive help. For me, I went from around 30FPS fluctuating to 60FPS constantly.\n\n- Unconfirmed FPS fix for everyone but for me, restarting before playing the game gives you a perfect 60FPS performance everywhere, minus some very little stuttering. My build if anyone is wondering...\n- GPU: AMD R9 380\n- CPU: i5 3470k\n- RAM: Corsair Vengeance 8GB.","November 9, 2015","true","45.8"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

And I sure hope I would have read any reviews before purchasing it... Because what I was stuck with was a extremely poorly optimized game which ran in 720p with no graphics options whatsoever. However, there was still hope for me, within just A DAY the work of ONE man was enough to give me what I craved for. Full HD resolution... Something that should be the absolutely minimum to be supported. Then when I today saw that Square Enix had released an update I got quite excited, so I rushed to the news feed to see what they had updated and this is what I saw...\n\n"Hello,\n\nThe FINAL FANTASY XIII team have been working hard to improve your experience on Steam and we're happy to announce the following changes will be rolled out.\n\n■ All versions\nA request-to-confirm notification, will now appear when you try to quit from the full-screen mode. "\n\nIs it not enough that they have yet to be able to do what a single man was able to do within a fraction of the time they had to develop this game, but then they go out and post that they have been working HARD! This makes me rather upset, I would never in my life recommend this game to anyone and it's a shame, it's most likely a pretty decent game which have rather stunning graphics when you are able to play it in 60fps 1080p... However, I can't recommend a game where it takes the developers over a month to put out a fix for something as mundane as the fact that the ESC-button simply shuts down the whole game. A fix like that shouldn't just take less than a day to fix, it shouldn't even have been there from the start.\n\nSquare Enix have made great games and I really mean great games. With stunning visuals and great storytelling, however, if this is how they wish for their PC-versions to be, then I'm sad to say that I no more will buy a game from them. At least not until they prove that they have learnt their leason.","November 11, 2014","false","8.0"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","9","17","0","0"

The thumbs up is an "only for a certain kind of gamer" recommendation. While that usually doesn't need to be said, in this case fans of RPGs may find the game's flaws too glaring to forgive. So I strongly recommend researching the ups and downs of Final Fantasy XIII before committing to a purchase. Steam does have a refund policy, but it takes more than two hours of game-time to really see where FF13's design flaws come into play.\n\nHaving played through this game on the PlayStation 3, I can say without reservation that I enjoy this game's combat system and that I think the characters are pretty cool in their own ways. Whether that can carry you through a 60 hour RPG is up to your individual tastes. The game can be engaging and pretty but the main draws that players associate with RPGs aren't really here. The storytelling is badly-paced and underdeveloped, often requiring the player to take a break and read in-game Datalog entries to solidify their understanding of the game's concepts. The stage design is almost oppressively linear for the vast majority of the game and does not really open up until close to the end (at which point you are given the opportunity to experience the plains and valleys of Gran Pulse, which introduces the kind of area design that Xenoblade Chronicles on the Wii gave players free reign over from the very moment they took control of Shulk and Reyn in Colony 9). There are no real town exploration sections except for a single mid-game interlude in a theme park which players are not allowed to revisit afterward, either; the game consists almost entirely of traversing enemy-laden wilderness and dungeon areas in a strictly linear progression, making it by far the most monotonous game in the Final Fantasy main series (one could accuse Final Fantasy X of being too linear, but it still had the basic staples of an RPG's adventure progression and the freedom to revisit old areas, two things XIII does not provide).\n\nThe negatives are ever-present and all-encompassing: this is a game that is definitely not for everyone, and even having enjoyed my first playthrough of it, I personally have not been compelled to either complete all of the sidequests (which you only gain access to once you reach that late-game Gran Pulse area) or to play through the story a second time. Replay value is at an all-time low here.\n\nIf these things do not sound like flaws that will totally break the experience for you, then I encourage you to give Final Fantasy XIII a try. If you're unsure which way you'll swing, I recommend watching some Let's Play videos of the game on YouTube to see for yourself what the game is like--HCBailly in particular is a good bet.\n\nThe bottom line is that this isn't a game I can give a single sweeping recommendation for. I could do that for the sequels, which while lacking in story cohesion are just better-designed as videogames; but this first entry in the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy is the hardest recommend to people, even as I can't see it as exactly "bad." If that makes any sense.\n\nIf there was an option in between "yes" and "no" I would probably have picked that instead.","December 10, 2015","true","1.0"," 9 of 17 people (53%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","53","9","17","0","3"

Picked this up on sale thinking, "There's no way it can be as bad as people say, can it?"\n\nIt is. It very, very much is. At first, I assumed the reason I could only control one character and the MIND-BLOWINGLY boring level design was that I was in a tutorial. Then hour one somehow managed to creep up on me and all hopes of me being trapped in some sort of Tutorial Hellscape were gone.\n\nNot to mention that out of that hour, I've maybe - MAYBE - actually been able to put in about an ten to fifteen minutes of solid gameplay. It's like the game director wanted to make a sequel to spirits within, then keeps remembering that it's supposed to be a game and throws the "player" a bone saying, "Oh, fine, wreck my beautiful story and DO something, if you MUST." I've lost count how many times I had to sit through 5-10 minutes of cutscene, only to fight one - ONE - fight before it was right back to the cutscenes.\n\nI even skipped a cutscene once. You know what happened next? IT PUT ME RIGHT INTO ANOTHER DAMNED CUTSCENE.\n\nLook, if you want to tell a story with a game, that's great. I love good stories in video games. But after watching (literally) almost an hour of cutscenes of this game, I don't even have the level of context of what's going on as I would if I woke up to six hobo's giving each other BJ's in my living room. I might not know how the hobos got in or why they chose my living room, but at least I can get an idea of WHY THEY'RE DOING IT. I mean, after this much time watching this train-wreck of a plot in this "game", I should be able to describe it better than "French Jesus is kind of a jerk and a kid is worryingly sad about his mom."\n\nEven the actual gameplay makes you feel like they just want you to sit and watch. You control ONE character, and nine times out of ten, you're just going to be mashing that auto-fight button. I feel like if one of the game directors were next to me while I was playing, they'd constantly be pushing me out of the way and taking over, saying, "UGH. MOOOOOVVVVVVE."\n\nNow, I understand that the game gets somewhat interesting after the 25-30 hour mark. Re-read that. Twenty-five to THIRTY PAIN-STAKING HOURS. That's like going to get the most delicious ice cream cone in town, but before you're allowed to have it, the sweaty dude behind the counter has to drag his balls over it. I don't care about ice cream THAT much, and I *certainly* don't care enough about this game to slog through 25-30 hours. Maybe if there were an option to have those first 25-30 hours summed up in a half hour cutscene (that you could SKIP), I'd be listening.\n\nThe thing is, with this game, they've taken as much control away from the player as they could, while still being able to classify it as a game. I might even still would be able to enjoy it if they didn't keep trying to hammer home story themes that were made brutally clear in the first few minutes of meeting the characters. Yes, FF13, I get it. Hope, the exponentially more and more ironically named character, is sad. Square-Enix, I now have to see an eye doctor because of the repetitive strain caused by all of my damned eye-rolling. Can we move on?\n\nI was willing to give this game the benefit of the doubt from all of the negative things I've heard, but with every chance the developers had to redeem this game, they wound up taking a big, steaming dump on my desk and giving me the finger.\n\nBut hey, there are some people out there who like this game. Maybe they're masochists, I don't know, that's their business. For the vast majority of gamers (myself included), however, this game really, truly, is as bad as they say it is.","February 7, 2015","false","1.1"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","53","10","19","5","9"

The game and its subsequent sequels offer some of the greatest visuals, original music, and engaging battle systems that builds off previous games in the series' successes.\n\nFFXIII serves as the introduction to the world and people of Cocoon, led by the "divine" Sanctum Fal'Cie, and whom are afraid of the world of Pulse that lies beneath their floating paradise. Lightning Farron is a sergeant in the Bodhum Regiment of the Guardian Corps whose life is changed when she is branded along with five others as a l'cie, a slave to a Fal'cie from Pulse tasked with the very destruction of her home. As she comes to terms with her fate of either fulfilling her 'Focus' or becoming an undying monster, she and her new companions are hunted by the military and hated by civilians. The story is a dramatic tale of six people that must put beside thier anger, fears, and despair, and make a choice...\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII is, like many other games in the series, one that demands some time to complete: Roughly 40 - 50 hours. Get ready to spend a week or so with this one. It is also a game that departs from many series staples, like exploring through towns and engaging in side quests. This means that the biggest draws for the game are its story and combat systems, which fortunately(in my opinion) get passing marks. The combat system in this game is called the 'Command Synergy Battle' system. Throughout the battle, you are in command of one character, the party leader, and the other characters in your group are operated by a surprisingly iintelligent A.I. that takes the best course of action in battle based on their selected roles and known enemy stats/weaknesses. There are six "classes" in the game: Commando, Ravager(magic attacker), Medic, Synergist(enhancing abilities), Sabeteur(enfeebling), and Sentinel(tank). Characters can develop their stats and abilities in the Crystarium by expending Crystal Points earned after the end of battles. Battles progress by switiching 'paradigms', or role combinations to best take advantage of the situation. Should you press the attack with a pair or ravagers and a commando to build up chain gauges? Should you put a sentinel on the field to soak damage while a synergist enhances your attacks? The choices are up to you as you try to weaken and 'stagger' enemies to submission. Trying to gain high battle ratings through skillful use of the paradigm system is surprisingly engaging.\n\nA grand portion of the game is spent "on the run" from the military, and this informs a lot of the exploration segments. So much in fact that the game has been called(rightfully so) very linear up to a certain point where it opens up tremendously. Fortunately there's never a dull moment in the story, and many times I've found myself needing a break just because of how intense the story and battles can get. This game can be hard, make no mistake. If you aren't careful in certain conflicts, enemies can get some pretty quick hits that'll have you retrying quite a few times.\n\nAfter originally having played Final Fantasy XIII on the Xbox 360 back in 2010, I've loved the the series even more with each new entry. The mythos behind Gran Pulse, Cocoon, and the beings that inhabit them create a dramatic story filled with great characters facing immense tragedy while trying to escape their fate as pawns in a Chess game being played by beings beyond their comprehension for reasons even more unclear. When it originally released, nobody was aware there would be a series of sequels released later, so a lot of the plot points seemed to be very hazy without the context provided by future games. I feel that this has become less of a problem with the release of Final Fantasy XIII-2(my personal favorite. Give this RPG a shot. It's different by a lot of standards, but I feel that it is an entry in the series with a lot of merits.","October 21, 2014","true","92.4"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","0"

That's all fine and dandy IF the cast begins at the START of the fight not because you're busting your !@#$ butt off and you get this slapped on you.  As a player, it makes me feel like crap.  I work hard to hold my ground and only lose the battle because I "took too long" that's just dumb!\n\n* Linear - Don't mind linearatiy but it would have been nice to have SOME open world (not just the chapter 11 part)  This doesn't bother me too much because the game tells a decent story (too poltical at first but somewhat makes sense at the end).\n\n* ♥♥♥♥ poor port - I know they're are putting a fix for this later this December but a final fantasy title a game with these awesome sauce graphics LOCKED at 1280x900 res?  Props to Durante for the GeDoS program took me 4 hours inintally to get it to work right (because it was in beta for FF13 so I would have wierd things like mini map not showing up, menu selections dimmed out, and blurry characters).  I finished this game before the fix has came out...which is sad.  It also interfers with the steam interface so I can't reply to my friends either.\n\n* No forcefeed back - Really?\n\n* BIG download - Give the option to download the Japanese voice overs, 60 GB is pretty huge.\n\nand finally\n\n* Leader dead = Game Over - I find it overwhelmingly frustrating that if the leader dies it's instant game over.  Sometimes this works in some games (like Persona 4) but for this one it really didn't.  I had many o times my leader being KO'ed were my other two party members were at full health....just frustrating.\n\nIf you can get over these factors, for $15 (or maybe 10$ for a sale), it's a decent purchase.  I overall enjoyed the game and had few rage quits but to recommend someone this title would be a flat out lie w/o warning them of these features (PS3 or even PC).\n\nOk fan boys, do your worst and trash my "review", I'm OUT!\n\n*Drops the mic*\n","December 6, 2014","false","75.2"," 13 of 25 people (52%) found this review helpful","52","13","25","0","3"

That could be considered as true, though I have at the time of writing this played 4 hours, I think it is a fun and worthwhile experience yuo should have if you like FF in general or like JRPGs. The soundtrack, maybe not as good as previous title in the 20 year-old-series is still very good and gets you pumped for battles adn cut-scenes.\nThe story is quite complicated but the general idea (no spoilers) is quite simple. Your characters become, lets say, 'cursed' in a huge accident whilst fighting in a resistance. For the most part I've played your characters are wondering around aimlessly trying to find things and people. But thats all for now.\nSummary : Very good JRPG with elements veterans will find familiar.\nGreat music.

Call me fickle, but fixing that alone has greatly increased this game's value for me - especially (pardon any potential snarkiness) as it makes it seem SE actually care about what they release on Steam.\n\nFFXIII, whilst it definitely has some issues - the story seems really overly complex for what it is and the game doesn't open up the full extent of its battle system until way later on (a problem I found was fixed in FFXIII-2, also available on Steam), I couldn't help but find myself enjoying it.\n\nI found that if you experiment with it fully, employing the use of Saboteurs and Synergists alongside Commandos, Medics and Ravagers, the Paradigm system is great fun to use, particularly later on when the battle system finally does fully open up.\n\nThe game definitely has some great visual design in both the characters and the world as well in my opinion, with the trip through Nautilus being a highlight for me, showcasing what might be best described as a "Final Fantasy Disneyland".\n\nThough the grindy combat system will understandably turn some people off the game, in my opinion those who can make it through that will find a huge JRPG adventure with a cast of either honestly or ironically enjoyable characters that whilst being incredibly long, never truly gets boring.\n\n\n...\n\nIf peeps can find a way to mod in alternate playermodels GAAAAH - you can do it, you beautiful modding geniuses, you! :P","December 12, 2014","true","10.9"," 40 of 79 people (51%) found this review helpful","51","40","79","0","3"

Did you played through the first chapter? Or even started the game? Since the graphics are more important than the game experience? Do you care about the story, the characters, the locations, the music, the battles? OK, the port is not the best, but play with it if you payed for it. I think many of you have not played with the previous FF games like V or even VII…\n\nWhat you will expect from this Final Fantasy (tl,dr; if you interested please read all, I played with the X360 version):\n\nPros:\n- Exciting new combat system\n- Lovable characters with background story\n- Epic music\n- Amazing and captivating story, but...\n\nCons:\n- ...Linear and complicated (only at early)\n- Minimal open world\n- Short especially for a FF game\n- Not the best RPG\n\nPlaytime: Story: 45+ hours (ofc with cutscenes), Full Achievements: 130-150 hours(or more based on farming-luck)\n\nTerms you may need to know first:\n\nFal’cie – False gods, machines responsible for the creation and maintenance of the land where humans dwell, and indirectly govern their lives. They can turn the people into l’cie.\n\nL’cie - humans "branded" by divine entities (mostly fal’cies) and given great physical and magical power, as well as a Focus to fulfill. If they manage to complete their Focus they will become crystal or you will become a cie’th. People are afraid of l’cies.\n\nCie’th – those who fail to complete their Focus in time. They are mindless monsters who attack everybody.\n\nCocoon – A planet which floats in the sky above the land of Gran Pulse (it’s like the Moon), the events starts here.\n\nGran Pulse – A planet like the Earth, and Cocoon floats in its atmosphere. It is a world of natural evolution where animals and plants can grow to tremendous sizes\nthe human civilization of Gran Pulse had nearly been wiped out by the War of Transgression.\n\nThe War of Transgression – It was a war fought between Cocoon and Gran Pulse between six and seven hundred years.\n\nPurge – It is a form of social cleansing conducted by the Sanctum, the fal'Cie-run government of Cocoon, to get rid of those believed to have been "touched" by Gran Pulse.\n\nStory/Characters:\n\nIf you new in Final Fantasy games I can recommend this one, it plays on a planet called Cocoon, where you can control 6 characters, our heroine is Lightning who was a soldier (Guardian Corps) she is on the Purge train to save her sister Serah who is caught by a fal’cie and marked as a l’cie. Serah’s boyfriend Snow travels to the Hanging Edge to fight PSICOM and the Purge in the hopes of saving her. Meanwhile Sazh the old timer pilot boards with Lightning to save his son Dajh. On the same train Vanille (who is already a l’cie), Hope and his mother are part of the group of exiles onboard the Purge train. And Fang who will appear later in the story she searches for Vanille and aims to complete her Focus. Their ways cross them to Serah who fulfill her task as a l’cie and turns into crystal while the other party members marked as l’cie. With the fatal fate on their shoulders our heroes take up the struggle against the curse, rescue Serah and Cocoon’s people from the suffering of the fal’cies… “The Battle Within Begins...”\n\nFor me this game 10/10, if I need to compare to the other FF games then 8.5/10.\n\nIf you liked this masterpiece I can recommend the XIII-2 and Lightning Returns too.\n\nThanks for reading!\n","October 10, 2014","true","110.5"," 59 of 117 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","59","117","0","11"

If you play for graphics, you aren't a gamer and should uninstall steam.\n\nAlright, this is going to be lengthy. Since most haters can't put up arguments on why this game is bad, here's my good/bad. Overall i'd give this game a 7/10.\n\nGood things I liked about Final Fantasy 13 was the side quests(all 64 of them), the paradom(paradime? forgot the systems name), memorible characters and the fact they added more to the story.\n\nGame had difficulty, specailly first bartandualus fight(don't know how to spell that face gods name), the summon things that come out when they face themselves were no pushovers and the star rank rating system was amusing, good way to test out your skill.\n\nBad things I don't like is the AMOUNT of cutscenes they have, its like MGS4, they focused too much on the story. The footsteps were also very loud, annoyed me through most of the game. The villians were also meh, didn't really like them all too much. I forgot them fairly quick.\n\nThe game did much better in 13-2 by allowing EVERY area you've been to be explored again. Required a lot of back tracking to get through the game. Even had a difficulty level in case you thought the game was too hard or too easy. The main villian was great, very memorble.\n\nLightning returns story was bleh at best, but I LOVED the action RPG combat it had. Not to mention you could explore EVERYTHING in that game. Requires a lot of side quests to be able to finish the 5 bosses(6, not sure cause of hidden boss on the 13th day). The villian was bloody terrible, bad writing too.\n\nI'd recommend it for RPG lovers, not for casual gamers however.","October 9, 2014","true","34.5"," 64 of 128 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","64","128","0","1"

Nothing enjoyable to switch it up i.e. no blitzball, no chocobo hide and seek, no Lindblum hunting festival, no card game. I'm not exaggerating when i say nothing interesting ever happens. Everything that happened after the first bossfight about 11 hours ago was meaningless and uninspired.\n\n- terrible writing - not fun, not interesting in any way. Most characters just whine all the time.\n\n- boring story - played 13 hours and i still know about as much as after 2 hours of playing\n\n- terrible combat - you control only 1 character with a very limited skillset at a time in a FF typical ATB System. Imagine if in Final Fantasy 7 you could only ever give orders to 1 character which the game picks for you for a majority of the game. It also has barely any strategy outside of --> get stagger --> burn -->low hp? -->heal. This applies to every enemy in the game and even bosses are lame.\n\n- no limit breaks (wot???)(this deserved special mentioning)\n\n- linear progression/bad rpg elements - the way you characters progress is pretty much laid out for you. There is close to 0 customization. All characters feel essentially the same with some stat differences.\n\n- looks good but resolution is capped at 720p and even in fullscreen mode there's huge black bars on the top and bottom of my screen which i looked for a way to remove but didnt find any (steam forum / ingame / google)\n\n+ audio is nice\n\nI will probably finish the game at some point just to be able to say i played through it but after 13 hours of played time there's nothing here that makes me want to play it.","October 27, 2014","false","13.7"," 44 of 88 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","44","88","0","3"

I'm not going to give my opinion of the game in detail but I will say that it is very underrated and, if nothing else, worth experiencing at this price for the visuals and audio alone. Square Enix is truly in a class of their own when it comes to audio/visual design and FFXIII is one of the best places to see it until XV is released. This new port of the game is optimized to run at 60 frames per second, maximum, though you might have a hard time hitting that consistently if your system isn't configured properly. By enabling Vsync through my GPU drivers for this game, forcing Anisotropic Filtering (which is unrelated but really helps the visuals), and setting my PC to Maximum Performance in the power settings I was able to get 60fps at almost all times during battle and field scenes, though cutscenes (especially the pre-rendered ones of course) tended to hover around 30fps, which is fine.\n\nIn general, if you were ever interested in this game and are very easily swayed by gorgeous, artistic visuals and sound, you will enjoy this game, especially at a discount like this. The Japanese dual audio option also helps if you find the English voices grating on your ears, which is subjective; I'm fine with them but options are always nice! It's true that, at the moment, the game is locked at 720p and you use the ESC key to quit the game, but those are not nearly as big of a deal as they're made out to be as long as your GPU or monitor properly scales the game to your screen size. The game uses a lot of post-processing effects so that the 720p visuals are barely noticeable on my 1080p screen except for occasional aliasing, and the game runs so smoothly with those small tweaks that I barely notice anything "wrong" with how the game looks anyway. In the end, if you've intended to give this game a try or even experience it again, there is no better time than now.\n\nMy general, relevant specs, if anyone is curious, are:\nCPU: Intel i5 3570k OC'd from 3.8 to 4.2ghz\nGPU: Nvidia GTX 770\nMonitor: Asus 1080p 60hz","October 11, 2014","true","4.2"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It took you by your Hand an guides u through the surprisingly complex Story. Yes it is linear, yes the port is not perfect and it runs on 720p / 60fps, but this smooth. And it looks beautiful, at least in my opinion. Encountered no bugs / problems so far, my Xbox Controller works fine with it and it feels exactly like a Final Fantasy should feel.\n\nlots of people are complaining about the combat system and how it isn't "FF - like" but i can't agree. Every single FF i've played so far had some unique kind of battle system, so does this one. The fact that u only control one Party member directly and the other two only indirectly makes the combat system not bad. If you want it easy just press auto fight. I's not the first FF with an Auto Fight option. Otherwise coordinate your Abilities and Combat stances by your self and yes, this can be quiet intresting. At least in my Opinion.\n\nPersonally i don't regret to buy this. Its a only 12€ Game and i've got enough out of it, to get my money valued already.\nOut there are Triple A 50 -60€ Games that doesn't can do that, at least not for me.","October 11, 2014","true","57.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The combat and mechanics are fine if a bit over top cartoony.\n\nI wanted to like this game and played all the way through but in the end I have to just describe it as bad.  The problem is, if you are going to have a linear story based game then the story needs to make sense and be interesting.  The plot in this game is literally the main characters wandering around never knowining what to do next.  After having no clue what is happening the whole time, the evil bosses then give cliched speeches telling the heroes what to do next.  It is truely awful.\n\nThis isnt just bad translation or acting.  The characters actually endlessly discuss that they never know what to do next.  That is the plot.   Square literally has no idea how to write a plot and dialogue that makes any sense for them to follow.  This is really to bad because alot of other things about the game are great.  The characters themselves are fairly interesting and the English voice acting is actually top notch making me want to like the characters.  The actual plot and sequence of events is just eyerolling and unforgivable.\n\nIf anyone is totally new to the Final Fantasy games, get Final Fantasy 10 in the bargain bin instead of this one.  It is better in just about every way imaginable with a story that actually makes some sense.

Nothing about this game promots PC ready. All they did was take the xbox 360 version and copy it to render on the PC in lame ♥♥♥ 720P with issues surrounding tearing. I can max out my settings easily, I can download an extra program that will allow me to run at upscaled 1080P, but it does nothing to help the ♥♥♥♥ poor rendering that makes it seem like im running at 25fps constantly. I would rather ask the company for my money back not only on this purchase but for the console version that I bought years ago after this blasphemy of a PC release.\n\nSo I fare warn anyone who is wishing to download this. About 15-20 GB of data are useless if you don't need the Japanese version, Unless you can get your AA to 16 or 24X it will not fix all of the issues. If you don't want to have to remember switching your video settings to 720P or having to open an extra program, or even building a batch file to do it all for you, then save your money, save your time, most of all save your dignity and do not buy this. I was a huge FF fan from the release of VII, but now I think it has passed after this ♥♥♥♥ storm. I was finally ready to play it to see the ending for a change instead of searching for everything in the game.\n\n\nEDIT: my time may be very little but while I enjoy playing my games on a 50" TV, and being able to relax on a couch I am happy that I am able to use my controller for this. Yes the game still holds up to the original release from PS3 and sh!tbox, but not having any controls for the graphics sucks. I was hoping to max out how it would look compared to when I played it on console. Maybe I will wait to hear from some other people on how they fixed the settings, or I can wait from game evolved to have an optimization for it. Other than buying it while it was $15 thats my only enjoyment.","October 16, 2014","false","13.4"," 6 of 12 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","6","12","0","0"

TLDR - Horrible porting job.\n\nThere are no graphical settings. You are locked in to 720p and have no control over texture quality, antialiasing  or anything else. You can use GeDoSaTo to get around this, which will allow you to get the resolution up, but it has no effect on the pre-rendered cut scenes (of which there are plenty).\n\nThe game couldn't tell the difference between a 360 controller and a joystick, wouldn't let me choose, and refused to accept the latter's input until the former had been unplugged.\n\nIt's a good thing that the save points are so close together, because pressing escape will immediately  exit the game. No warnings. Straight to desktop. Why did they bind the ragequit button to one that is normally used to exit a menu?!?\n\nDon't expect to alt-tab either. And attempt to minimise the game will make it crash. If you're unlucky enough to have something minimise the game (add new hardware wizard, I'm looking at you!) you're going to be re-loading your save from the most recent point.\n\nIf the one-man team behind 'From Dust' can do an awesome PC Port, I don't see why Square Enix can't.

If you play for graphics, you aren't a gamer and should uninstall steam.\n\nAlright, this is going to be lengthy. Since most haters can't put up arguments on why this game is bad, here's my good/bad. Overall i'd give this game a 7/10.\n\nGood things I liked about Final Fantasy 13 was the side quests(all 64 of them), the paradom(paradime? forgot the systems name), memorible characters and the fact they added more to the story.\n\nGame had difficulty, specailly first bartandualus fight(don't know how to spell that face gods name), the summon things that come out when they face themselves were no pushovers and the star rank rating system was amusing, good way to test out your skill.\n\nBad things I don't like is the AMOUNT of cutscenes they have, its like MGS4, they focused too much on the story. The footsteps were also very loud, annoyed me through most of the game. The villians were also meh, didn't really like them all too much. I forgot them fairly quick.\n\nThe game did much better in 13-2 by allowing EVERY area you've been to be explored again. Required a lot of back tracking to get through the game. Even had a difficulty level in case you thought the game was too hard or too easy. The main villian was great, very memorble.\n\nLightning returns story was bleh at best, but I LOVED the action RPG combat it had. Not to mention you could explore EVERYTHING in that game.

Nothing enjoyable to switch it up i.e. no blitzball, no chocobo hide and seek, no Lindblum hunting festival, no card game. I'm not exaggerating when i say nothing interesting ever happens. Everything that happened after the first bossfight about 11 hours ago was meaningless and uninspired.\n\n- terrible writing - not fun, not interesting in any way. Most characters just whine all the time.\n\n- boring story - played 13 hours and i still know about as much as after 2 hours of playing\n\n- terrible combat - you control only 1 character with a very limited skillset at a time in a FF typical ATB System. Imagine if in Final Fantasy 7 you could only ever give orders to 1 character which the game picks for you for a majority of the game. It also has barely any strategy outside of --> get stagger --> burn -->low hp? -->heal. This applies to every enemy in the game and even bosses are lame.\n\n- no limit breaks (wot???)(this deserved special mentioning)\n\n- linear progression/bad rpg elements - the way you characters progress is pretty much laid out for you.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/klyxmaster/recommended/292120/","klyxmaster","Klyxmaster","http://steamcommunity.com/id/klyxmaster/","320 products in account","Has the Final Fantasy franchise lost its ability to make a game?  Like many of the recent Final Fantasy series (I would say 12+), these are nothing short of an amazing movie, with the viewer/player taking part in the battles.  The rest is left to movie script.\n\nPlaying the many hours of the XBOX and a few hours on the PC (bad port - esc key kicks me out! Really? and I didn't save), it became apparent that the game just guided the player through a scripted movie, and all the while I watched I kept yelling "..LET ME PLAY DAMMIT". Square Enix LITERALLY controlled the player, not the other way around, What if the player needed a break? nope - just gonna have to hold it.  It was mentioned to me that after about 25hrs of game play, you end up in the open world. Really? Players have to sit through a 25hr movie, to "get to the good stuff" and even then, I found, it is still limited to the movie script, and not what the player wants to do.\n\nIt's no doubt that Square Enix reigns supreme in the graphic skills, and one only needs to watch a few videos to see this. But what about game play? This is a game. Most would feel that game play involves PLAYER interaction on many levels, after all, they are in control!\n\nWhile playing, I kept feeling that I was playing THE WALKING DEAD (any episode). I get to watch the movie, with a few breaks in between for some action scenes. But even TWD had more interaction, as you were allowed to interact with the NPC's to change the outcome of the game, and other events. In FF13 a great opportunity came when the mom wanted to join. But no, scripted right on by while players just sit and watched.\n\nSquare Enix has more than enough skill, money and man power to make a game something similar to METRO, FALLOUT 3, TOMB RAIDER and the list is endless. Like Final Fantasy, these games are linear, but there is an added illusion of freedom, and many choices will change the out come of the game.\n\nWhen people sit down to play a 55gig game, they expect to PLAY. Not to sit cut-scene after cut-scene.  I was really excited at the beginning, when the kids were gonna hop on that cycle, and many  thought, sweet, gonna take a look around, but no, that was taken from the player as well. We sat helpless as the "game" guided it to the next destination. Maybe players want to go left, instead of right (at all times) and learn from mistakes that was the wrong way. Tell a NPC that they are wrong, only to find out later, we better go back and make them change their mind so we can progress the story. Many AAA games are out there that do this, why is Square Enix behind?\n\nIf you are looking for a hand-holding "game"  to do more than fight, and watch the movie, this is not for you. To me, this is an alpha game, simply because player interaction is not finished, story line control needs to be adjusted (Star Wars TOR?, Old game, but you can interact with the NPCs). Square Enix is NOT a small company, yet the continue to make games that, while amazingly drawn, come across as something created by a small company and empty.  Never have I played a game, where I was so disappointed at not only being a part of this story, but even in combat it was nothing more than button mashing (after you set up some combat settings).\n\nSadly, many REALLY wanted to play this one, as  most are avid FF fans, but even they are at their "Limit Break-ing" point. This is not the 90's, and higher standards for the Final Fantasy franchise have been set. I don't want to watch cut-scenese, we know Square Enix can make trailers - we want to play your game!\n\nEDIT:\nI wanted to add  that if the game goes on sale (reasonably priced that is), and you are a FF fan, definately one you want to add to your collection. But paying full boat to watch a movie and play stunt man for the fight scenes - watch it on youtube.","November 2, 2014","false","6.2"," 25 of 50 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","25","50","0","0"

TLDR - Horrible porting job.\n\nThere are no graphical settings. You are locked in to 720p and have no control over texture quality, antialiasing  or anything else. You can use GeDoSaTo to get around this, which will allow you to get the resolution up, but it has no effect on the pre-rendered cut scenes (of which there are plenty).\n\nThe game couldn't tell the difference between a 360 controller and a joystick, wouldn't let me choose, and refused to accept the latter's input until the former had been unplugged.\n\nIt's a good thing that the save points are so close together, because pressing escape will immediately  exit the game. No warnings. Straight to desktop. Why did they bind the ragequit button to one that is normally used to exit a menu?!?\n\nDon't expect to alt-tab either. And attempt to minimise the game will make it crash. If you're unlucky enough to have something minimise the game (add new hardware wizard, I'm looking at you!) you're going to be re-loading your save from the most recent point.\n\nIf the one-man team behind 'From Dust' can do an awesome PC Port, I don't see why Square Enix can't.

Dull linear story with boring characters that made me wonder if Square Enix even tried on this game half as much as they did on 10 or 12.\nLinear Storyline\nMain Character with no personality - Dull dialogues and voice.\nCombat system is a joke without depht unlike 12 where you had to be really tactical.\nin no other game than in 13 do they let you experience the feeling how it is to be caged. i mean it. you walk down a given path the whole game long without even ONE area to explore and a few minutes later, fight, cutscene. walk another minute. cutscene - repeat.\nIt does have gorgeous graphics but graphics alone isnt enough to justify its price when it first got released.\nFinal Fantasy series has managed to make me laugh, sad, angry and cry in positive ways but 13 only managed to make me alt+f4 a few times.\n4 out of 10 cuz of graphics and music and a somewhat existent story (not that story matters in 13 though). without those...i wonder if i would even be able to give 1 point","January 28, 2015","false","50.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","2"

The fact is this is still a continual issue that they have not bothered to fix before shoveling the second one out.  This just plain disgusts me as a loyal customer to the company and a die hard fan of the final fantasy series (ya since nintendo).  Its seems like another ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port to grab up some extra cash I feel that they either didn't care or just flat out disregarded the PC community allowing their name to pull us into buying it because who cares if it doesn't perform well the cash has been spent. .   I spent 6 hour downloading this game and another 6 hours trying to find a fix for the stuttering and the missing voice over audio whenever the characters speak.   One thing is right though it is a unique experience I don't think anything has made me this frustrated outside of an EA game.   I honestly would recommend just buying it for your console (and I am not a fan of consoles) but the money spent would be well worth it to avoid this crippling dissapointment.","February 9, 2015","false","16.7"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","1"

This game is a terrible let down for the series. Linearity to the point of disbelief, boring simplistic combat. I can't comment on the story because I uninstalled after about an hour.

That said, the game looks amazing with the Durante fix that I'm sure you can find easily by googling.  FPS suffers a bit but not much with the patch, but does drop every now and then, but not enough to ruin the experience (for me at least).   Also, just to put this out there, the alt-tab issue is fixed with the patch, the steam overlay seems to slow down significantly, and hitting escape will still exit the game immediately.\n\nFor those that HAVEN'T played the game before, DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN RPG.  Exploration is near non-existent, you have only a slight choice in building your characters, and during the 'tutorial' that lasts what seems like half the game, you don't even have control over your party as a whole.  There's only slight differences in the stats and abilities of all characters that you will have control over once everyone is fully built.\n\nOn the good side, however, i really enjoy the music and gameplay.   This is one of my favorite FF piano soundtracks, and even though it's not a true RPG, the gameplay is fast paced and does require a small degree of strategy (a little more so on the 'bosses').  The graphics deserve special mention as they are amazing.  Once again, you realy need the fix because the default steam version looks AWFUL compared to even the xbox's version.  And the story... oh the story... It has so much potential and is just a convoluted mess.   And don't get me started on the characters.  This may be a shoo-in for having at least some of the most shallow FF characters of all time, and easily has one of the most annoying.\n\nSo do I recommend it? Yep.

Final Fantasy XIII is kind of a mess...yet I was still compelled to finished it.\n\nThe first half of the game is linear to a fault, this would be fine if the battles were interesting at that point, but they aren't.  So you're looking at 20-30 hours of hitting the A button until you get to the next very pretty cutscene.\n\nThen it opens up and becomes more engaging in the gameplay department for a while, until you realize at that point it has just become a grindy, fairly boring JRPG of yore.\n\nThe story is fairly close to being complete nonsense and the characters are hard to relate to when they're trying to get their overwrought anime drama-on in a universe that's built on pillars of gobbledegook.  That said, I somewhat begrudgingly grew to like the characters -- only a little mind you, but that's more than I thought I would based on what they were like in the beginning.\n\nAnd yet in spite of many flaws...I still finished it.  I guess because once you put the battles on easy difficultly (highly recommended if you value your time) it's fairly inoffensive to play and nonsense though it may be, I was still interested in seeing the story brought to its conclusion.","June 21, 2015","true","65.7"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

I have played a couple of other FF games but once you play X or XIII it is hard to go back to the older ones. Final Fantasy lived up to my hopes that it would be comparable to X. While many people complain about the linearity of the game and the limit to exploration, I think it is fine. When I played this game I played it for the story, which is possibly my favorite story of any game I have ever played, all of the characters are unique and pull you into the story. I originally played this game on Xbox 360 and bought it on PC when it came out. While the PC port is sort of lazy, but they have improved it greatly. Compared to the Xbox version the graphics look incredible and really show how beautiful this game is. The soundtrack is one of the best I have heard and I love all of the songs and the scenes that they correspond to. The visuals in the game are gorgeous and the CGI cut scenes are so realistic and incredibly good looking. There are about 7 hours of cut scenes on their own. The sequels to this game are also similar, they have great stories and even better, more polished gameplay. The combat system works well and is very fun. End game there is plenty to do if you are one who likes farming to get the best gear and clearing all of the missions and objectives. I absolutely love this game and it will definitely play with your emotions and make you want to keep playing. This is in my Top 5 games of all time.\n\nPros:\n- Incredible story that has many plot twists and changes\n- Very developed and unique characters\n- Decent replayability with farming and gear\n- Great visuals\n- Stunning cutscenes\n- Great Soundtrack\n- long story (30-35 hours)\n\nCons:\n- Linear story\n- Below average port\n\nVisuals:           9/10\nAudio:             9.5/10\nCutscenes:      10/10\nGameplay:       7.5/10\nStory:              10/10\nReplayability:   4/5\nSolo:                N/A\nCo-op/Multiplayer: N/A\nBalance:             N/A\n\n\n\nOverall Score: 91/100","February 15, 2015","true","45.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Story\n\nThe Story lacks of the, for Final fantasy typically, boomer moments.\nThere is no real good story part or an turn of tables moment,\naltough the charakters are well made, and have nice treats, i cant belive,\nthat this story is written by the guys that made Final Fantasy VII.\nThe story is not bad but in the older titles you progress trough the game, cause of the story and here, the story doesnt keep me playing, but it isnt that bad either.\n\n5/10\n\n3. Gameplay\n\nThe Gameplay is very easy to handle, and every tutorial is easy to understand, so you get a very fast feeling of how to play even as newbie.\nThe fightingsystem has some overhaul but there i have to mention, that it feels like every fight is the same.\nThere is no such thing as poision status or limitbreak attacks.\nThe fightingmechanic seems a bit dull, because of that and for me thats the games second biggest problem.\n\nalso the mapping is somehow loveless, dont get me wrong there the maps are beautifull to watch BUT,\nthey are so linear that at some point you start wondering why you even run trough them.\nSo far i had NOT a single map which had more than 2 ways, or a map which is used more often in the story, like a city or a wood, which has to be passed more often.\n\nThe whole mechanics feel like you watch a movie with no real options, so the game gets boring pretty fast\n\n2/10\n\nSo i cant really recommend that title for Final Fantasy Fans, because of the story which somehow lacks my excpectations and the gameplay which is simply boring becaus it is held too easy and to far away from what i consider an RPG\n\nTotal 6/10\n\nWould not buy again","February 8, 2015","false","12.1"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

The graphics were nice and gameplay wasn't that complicated. This game took me a lot longer to finish than I had originally anticipated. It took me about 73ish hours to finish this game which I did not enjoy. Frankly it was too long for me. I don't understand why people would describe this game as "linear." When I played it, it did not feel very linear. They're a lot of side quests, lots of stuff you can find if you want, and lots of challenges that you can face if you want and of course there was a lot of grinding. I even got lost a few times wondering "ok, what am I suppose to be doing now?" The crysterium system (or however it's spelled) was probably one of the most infurating things I've encountered. I would constantly grind to max it out only to find out a few scenes later it would grow even bigger. I've had many moments while playing this game where I've said to myself "ok this has got to be the end or I'm really close to finishing this game" and I was way off. Let me give you a tip, when you're leveling the crysterium don't put any points in any other roles except the default ones given to the characters from the very begining. Save your points so once you reach level 5 (which is after you finish the game) and max out their main roles then you can start grinding for points in the other roles which aren't really neccessary and you'll probably won't use for some steam achievement or something. Oh and if you stuck on a mission that seems impossible, chances are it is. There are acouple of missions that are almost impossible to beat until after you finish the game so don't think it's because you didn't max the other not main roles, the game was simply made that way. I also found out while playing the game that the upgrading system is useless. You can finish this game without leveling your equipment at all. Save everything until after you finish the game then you can upgrade your equipment and try to unlock all of the things for a steam achievement or something. One last thing, this game is very buggy. It microstudders for me unless I use a 360 controller (or just a game controller) which is weird. This game is really poorly optimized for the PC. The FPS drops many times throughout the game. Even with the buggy FPS I still played this game and found some enjoyment out of it but it sucks that this game is optimized so poorly on the PC. I'm not going to recommend this game but I'm also not -not going to recommend this game, I leave that up to you. Since steam doesn't have a button other than yes or no I'll put a yes on it.","February 6, 2015","true","76.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Whether you like it or dislike it, there will always be a large number of people waiting to hate you for it. But I'll share my thoughts at least:\nI personally feel like 9 or 10 was the last true Final Fantasy game, then the world map disappeared, the battle system changed repeatedly, and of course, most areas became boring corridors in FF13.\nI wasn't a big fan of 12, but it was still fine, and so far (about half way through the game, I think), I dislike 13 more than any other Final Fantasy that has come before it. However, my thoughts continue to change on it as I get further...\n\nI started off very unimpressed by the boring areas, lack of exploration, annoying characters (or lack of personality, in Lightning's case), and I hated the battle system. I always enjoyed strategically giving commands to all my characters individually, but in this game, you only control the leader, and pretty much just give suggestions to the other party members. Granted, they're actually quite smart sometimes, but I just feel like I would be a lot more comfortable knowing exactly what everybody is going to do.\n\nBut as I got further, I started to accept things a bit more. The battle system is quite clever in some ways, the areas start to get slightly more interesting (I think), and despite what people say, there is actually some character development. I never thought I'd say it, but I've warmed up to the game, and even Lightning's character.\nBut at the same time, I think this is still my least favourite Final Fantasy (I've not played any other game in the FF13 trilogy yet). In fact, it's probably one of my least favourite JRPGs in general. And yet, I feel like the good parts are so good that it's still enjoyable and worth my time.\n\nAnyway, I'm far from an experienced reviewer or anything, but to anybody on the fence about whether or not to try this game, I'd say:\nGive it a go, but be patient with it. There were times when I just wanted to stop playing and give up on it, but I've continued onward and am enjoying it more than expected, for the most part. Give the characters a chance, even at their most obnoxious and whiny. They become more bearable, at least to me.\n\nAnd that's about all I can think of to say about this game. I hope it helped in any way at all, but if not, oh well... I'm just sharing my opinion online, leave me alone!

Graphic is stunningly beautiful with pretty low system requirements. Soundtrack is a breath of fresh air that keeps Final fantasy originally with something new add in the mix. Battle system is fun for a couple of hours, then became mindlessly routine. kind of Buff > attack > heal > attack > heal > attack > heal >  buff. why ? because weapons and items upgrade system that you'll need to upgrade them BUT at least for the first 10 chapter(out of 13) you can't afford it. Result in your attack became relatively weak and those 3M+ hp recycle boss(yeah you'll have to fight the same old boss about 3 time which nothing more than hp add in each time) and your attack around 3k each. it will be painfully LONG battle.\n\nDon't get me wrong, I think item upgrade system is good idea, but they didn't do it right. it worst matching them with Linear gameplay. unless you know what you're doing you'll mess up upgrade weapon with your very limited resource. For accessory it was far worse. You'll get a better one along the way so why upgrade them ? These thing need trial and error but you don't get to do it untill you get to ch. 11 so hang in there, don't lose Hope(he's pretty good dps btw)\n\nThe story ... hoo boy ... let's talk about story ( spoiler free ) The plot is cliché, shallow and well ... weak. You got power fight the mumbo jumbo name bad guy and save the world in the process. That's about sum it up. You won't get any sentimental moment like Saphy jump down and slash, dancing in the ballroom or save the princess from the mad queen. since It's action based RPG so don't expect much out of it.\n\nLastly this is just me who know a bit of Japanese. Transaltion suck real bad. They will be wrong 2 out of 10 if you read subtitle and listen to VO. Subtle emotions didn't came across due to cross culture thing THAT I can forgive but most of the time it is not. It's like you order pizza and get fried chicken, both are food but it is not the same. If in any case you want to learn Japanese don't try it here.\n\nI'd give this thing 6/10 not bad but not that good.\n\nNormally I'd give about 2 sentence review of any game. I've spent over 100 hours+ each on Final fantasy series title ( mainly 7 and 9 which I love it. the rest is about half of that time. It make me sad and want to rant it out each time Square relese a new game that manage to get lower and lower. Somehow they spent most of the time on graphic and less on story or gameplay mechanics which is sadden me a lot.\n\ntl;dr If you looking for a game to play over a long holiday that can be left unfinish without so much regret. This is about right to pick it up. Not recommend unless on sale, it's still worth at least that much. This game don't have Newgame+ so if you decided to get it take your time playing. and oh! happy hunting turtle(s) it's your new grinding nightmare.","February 12, 2015","false","73.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/serphius/recommended/292120/","serphius","Serphius","http://steamcommunity.com/id/serphius/","358 products in account","Final Fantasy XIII is not a good Final Fantasy, but it's a really fun and gorgeous JRPG.\n\nThe story follows two different worlds: Pulse and Cacoon, each so afraid of the others that even contact with someone from the other planet will cause friends and family to turn against each other in order to rid themselves of those affected. Ruled by benevloent creatures called fal'Cie, players follow a commando, Lightning, and the people she meets as they are touched and turned into l'Cie, or touched warriors, by a Pulse fal'Cie that had hidden on Cacoon for ages.\n\nThe combat system features some FF staples such as Phoenix Downs, summons, and certain magics, but instead of picking abilities individually, most players will likely be auto-attacking. Instead, the challenge comes from its Role system, or Paradigms. Paradigms are customized for each party, and rather than selecting attacks, players will be juggling roles among their characters fairly heavily. The result is a little different from other FFs, but it's fast-paced, pretty fun, and can get fairly difficult if role combinations don't pit well against tougher fights. Characters can then be leveled up by putting points into their various roles.\n\nPerhaps the biggest criticism with the game comes from the exploration, as this is where XIII splits from previous titles. Instead of an open world environment, players are set along linear paths with little room to move about. There are no World Maps, airships to control, or forests filled with random battles to get lost in. It feels nothing like Final Fantasies in that that regard.\n\nHowever, franchise name aside, the maps tend to work. Most jRPGs are simply "Go From Point A to Point B" to begin with, even with World Maps. The tunnels make it easier to play in shorter bursts for people with busy lives, and they keep players from forgetting where to go if they put the game down for a few weeks. The game does open up significantly in Chapter 11, but for the most part the game trims the fat and focuses on the fights and getting through the story.\n\nIt helps that the environments and character models are gorgeous. With the PC fixes/patches, everything is beautifully rendered with smooth models and bright color palette. The characters themselves are highly engaging (though some take longer to warm up to than others), and there's a great deal of cuteness scattered throughout. Even with the hallway maps, there is a great deal of content, and players can expect to spend 60+ hours easily to finish.\n\nI highly recommend this game if players can put the "Final Fantasy" name aside. There are certainly some great traditional FF elements here - big swords, Cid, a Moogleworks shop - but it doesn't feel like the classic games. That's perfectly ok. It's well worth the price when taken to be its own jRPG.","February 22, 2015","true","30.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Everyone complains about the linearity of the game and I knew about it but I didn't know exactly what they meant, so here is what they mean by linear. In most other FF games you can freely go to towns or villages that you have previously been to but this games is just forward all the time. There are no towns, no safe areas, no shops, or anything like that. Just the characters running pretty much down a hallway. The only "stops" are save points along the path that also serves as a shop.

Basically if you pay too much attention to other characters on the map, you may see edges that aren't exactly smooth.\n\nMY RATING: That said, I give this game 9/10, considering it's an FF jRPG classic and the graphics are amazing and the port is really good.\n\nDISMISSAL OF GRAPHICS WHINERS WITHOUT APPROPRIATE HARDWARE: As I said before, I'm a software developer, and, using my knowledge of code and now experience with the game, I don't think the character models, textures, etc. need any updating to 1080p. Instead, let folks add AA and such, if they can't already get that through their graphics driver. It would ruin the original graphics, imho! I heard someone complain that the computer got the lesser quality cutscenes, but 50GB is enough for a game, imho, and, again, this is the definitive modern jRPG non-MMO graphically and otherwise as far as I'm concerned.\n\nSUMMARY: So, that done, on to the summary of the game: be prepared to not understand the story or how combat works completely for 4-8 hours, depending on the speed you play jRPGs. But this game delivers in length- not quite as long as I'd wish in a perfect world, but, being completionist, it took me at least 120hrs to get through. You can handle that, as the crazy FF fan who can't choose between FF, FFIII, FFIV, and FFVI for the best FF, right? FFVII was great, no question, but not in the running... kind of like FFX.\n\nSTORY: actually not bad, after you understand what le'cie are... the voice acting is very good, including the annoying teenage female character who later develops. The story draws various types of relationships between the characters, drawing you into the necessity of the quest. Altogether, it's somewhat contrived, but, hey, go retrieve four crystals and no further explanation!\n\nGAME MECHANICS: The most annoying thing is the lack of a world-map like most final fantasy series games... a lot of the fun/sense of accomplishment of other FFs is when you gain a vehicle that allows you to visit those "secret" places you couldn't go to before. So, I think this is where the "linear" criticism comes from. You will see a multi-level large world environment. And there is an elementary "side-quest" system, and you can still go through areas again and again (it sometimes gets old, but seldom, since the wonderful music and varied environments keep you in it) to chase after the ultimate badassdom.\n\nThe class system/grouped-combat feels confining for about 4-8 hours until you realize the variety of skills each character specializes in and that the system makes "formation" of front/back seem like "Goodnight, Moon." Though I love that book. You can play the combat in so many ways- I recommend ignoring the timer-based results of combat... just try all sorts of techniques out... you can speed-kill later.\n\nCOMBAT: There are people who hate the fact that a jRPG is not Truly turn-based, and vice-versa. I like both, especially that correct blend that gives me time to decide strategy and "units of time" to work with, while reasonably limiting the decision as to sometimes influence my decisions. Hence, the "auto-battle" technique you're familiar with so far. Guess what? "Auto-battle" is surprisingly often what you want to do - healing) auto-heal will pick the person who needs healz the most tank) well, depends how you like to tank, but it spams some sort of guard skill, which you'd usually do anyway. Taunting skills are used too much, but you can always stop the queue after you successfully taunt, giving the skill added value since it auto-picks non-taunted targets.\n\nThe bosses are challenging to a mid-aged gamer who played each FF. Most teach you to use new game-mechanics, and there are definite tough-fights if you go seeking them. And the bosses are like "wait, whoa- look twice."\n\nAnyway, the combat system has true depth, give it some time, and once you have some good commands, you're only badass if you set the default command to "abilities" instead of "auto-battle."\n\nEND: In the end, FFXIII really delivers what you'd expect of Square *coughSOFT* Enix. The port is pretty well done considering some annoying FF ports in the past, that felt half-♥♥♥♥♥. FFXIII is ftw once you realize that it's a post-MMO jRPG that chose a lot of the good parts of an MMO without being online. But don't think it's dumbed-down, because it has worthy challenges. This is truly the definitive jRPG of the post-MMO world, with all the bells and whistles you'd expect, imho. Not that I don't log in to FFXIV now and again ;)","January 1, 2015","true","646.0"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

The combat is fun to figure out as well and gives you options to customize your team how you want to play. You can focus on Buffs,Debuffs,Meele,Casting,Tanking.

I thoroughly enjoyed the game and I don't undertand what is so confusing about the story to people. At this point, I think it is just a fad to call this story confusing. Sure some of the charatcers seem a little flat and aren't lovable, but they grow on you in different ways. Definitely by far, Hope has the most character development and becomes one of my favorites story-wise by the end of the game.\n\nEnough about the story though, let's talk about the port. So far (Although I haven't played it much yet) I have not run into a single bug, runs just as smooth as you would expect from a Square Enix game. the 60fps is definitely noticable having played it at a now considerably less smooth 30fps on console. The anti-aliasing is also a great touch going all the way up to 16x to wipe away the jaggies that 7th gen console games are known for. Having not actually changed the textures of the game (which still look fine for 2014), don't worry about raising the settings and experiencing lag because as long as you meet the recommended, pump up that AA. The shadows resolution goes all the way up to 8k creating crisp player shadows suring fights and walking around. And last but not least, being able to run this game natively 1080p is a dream come true. Given the astonishing beauty of this game even on console, a 1080p version of it makes it all the better and really turns this game into a piece of art.\n\nNow as for cons, just wish that they would have tweaked the gameplay just a bit like the camera control which is still god-awful. All it wants to do is reset back to center. Might as well have a fixed camera. I would have liked better camera control to admire the beautiful scenery this game has to offer. Also speeding up the gameplay such as making paradigm shifts smoother like in XIII-2 would have been nice. Instead you have the long drawn-out shifts. Also I would have liked to see them up the amount of Gil you get from treasure chests or maybe throw in Gil when you win a battle. Gil shortage was a huge problem in the console version and required endless hours of Trapezohedron and Plat ingot hunting to get enough to get everyone's final weapons. On console, I put about 120 hrs into a single playthrough of this game and probably more than 20 of it was grinding for money... This game was obviously a copy and paste port, but at the price point, can't blame them.\n\nGiven there are no bugs so far and the game looks better and plays just as well as on console, I give the port a 9/10 and the game a 8/10. For a final fantasy game story wise, 7.5/10.\n\nMy RIG\ni5-3570K 3.5GHz Quad\n8GB RAM\nGIGABYTE GTX 770 2GB OC Edition\n120GB SSD (only for Windows launch though)\n2TB Hard Drive for storage\nASRock Extreme3 MoBo","February 10, 2015","true","93.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's combat style is quick paced and interesting to watch but can unfortunately become a tedious mash of auto battle unless you are looking for the best strategies to consistantly 5 star your fights and boss battles in epic strategic frustration.\n\nIt's story is based mostly on the development of characters' morals and their reason to "keep on fighting" but other than that we are left quite in the dark about the history of Cocoon and Gran Pulse which would have been amazing to flesh out and bring to life within the game. I have yet to finish FF XIII-2 or play Lightning Returns to see how the world fleshes out but it is an interesting and exciting universe.\n\nHowever, it's linearity is frustrating but offers the same number of options previous Final Fantasy games offered for early game story. The length of the "tutorial" as seen by a lot of the public to be the first 9 or so chapters can be quickly played through with dodges and correct combinations of upgrades in less than 4 hours but this requires a lot of skill and strategy of a later playthrough. So for your first time sitting through expect a 15 hour + "tutorial" but with a lot of "annoying" characters that have you screaming "ughhh, not you again" to "why won't you just die!"\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience with the computer ported game as it ran just as smoothly and even smoother in most parts than my previous Xbox360 could handle and also displayed in better resolution when I have quite a weak laptop for such displays. I barely experienced lag so far in my play and found this still to be one of my favourite games.","March 12, 2015","true","29.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

No joke. Okay, I wanted to give a Final Fantasy game a try too.\n\nI was very pleasantly surprised.\n\nYes, the game has it's shortcomings. The vast majority of the game has you running down "corridors" because the game is THAT linear. Yes, the story is a bit confusing to begin with, but once you get into the swing of things it picks up quite well (there's always the internet/datalog to assist you). Yes, the meat of the gameplay doesn't really begin to surface until a few hours in when you can manage your team and get into the bigger fights. Yes, there is a bit of grinding towards the end as the difficulty curve increases sharply.\n\nHowever, after all that you still have an interesting game with unique and fleshed-out characters, with a fantastic musical score, in-depth lore, emotion-invoking story, immersive graphics, and intense gameplay to boot! I was really happy with my purchase and it took me a good 30-40 hours to complete the game first time around. In fact, at the time I couldn't help but pray for a sequel (which, it turns out, wasn't as good and XIII was in fact best as a standalone story).\n\nIf you like Final Fantasy or game's with fantastic story/cutscenes, I whole-heartedly recommend this game.

Ruled by benevloent creatures called fal'Cie, players follow a commando, Lightning, and the people she meets as they are touched and turned into l'Cie, or touched warriors, by a Pulse fal'Cie that had hidden on Cacoon for ages.\n\nThe combat system features some FF staples such as Phoenix Downs, summons, and certain magics, but instead of picking abilities individually, most players will likely be auto-attacking. Instead, the challenge comes from its Role system, or Paradigms. Paradigms are customized for each party, and rather than selecting attacks, players will be juggling roles among their characters fairly heavily. The result is a little different from other FFs, but it's fast-paced, pretty fun, and can get fairly difficult if role combinations don't pit well against tougher fights. Characters can then be leveled up by putting points into their various roles.\n\nPerhaps the biggest criticism with the game comes from the exploration, as this is where XIII splits from previous titles. Instead of an open world environment, players are set along linear paths with little room to move about. There are no World Maps, airships to control, or forests filled with random battles to get lost in. It feels nothing like Final Fantasies in that that regard.\n\nHowever, franchise name aside, the maps tend to work. Most jRPGs are simply "Go From Point A to Point B" to begin with, even with World Maps. The tunnels make it easier to play in shorter bursts for people with busy lives, and they keep players from forgetting where to go if they put the game down for a few weeks. The game does open up significantly in Chapter 11, but for the most part the game trims the fat and focuses on the fights and getting through the story.\n\nIt helps that the environments and character models are gorgeous. With the PC fixes/patches, everything is beautifully rendered with smooth models and bright color palette. The characters themselves are highly engaging (though some take longer to warm up to than others), and there's a great deal of cuteness scattered throughout. Even with the hallway maps, there is a great deal of content, and players can expect to spend 60+ hours easily to finish.\n\nI highly recommend this game if players can put the "Final Fantasy" name aside. There are certainly some great traditional FF elements here - big swords, Cid, a Moogleworks shop - but it doesn't feel like the classic games. That's perfectly ok. It's well worth the price when taken to be its own jRPG.","February 22, 2015","true","30.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I thoroughly enjoyed the game and I don't undertand what is so confusing about the story to people. At this point, I think it is just a fad to call this story confusing. Sure some of the charatcers seem a little flat and aren't lovable, but they grow on you in different ways. Definitely by far, Hope has the most character development and becomes one of my favorites story-wise by the end of the game.\n\nEnough about the story though, let's talk about the port. So far (Although I haven't played it much yet) I have not run into a single bug, runs just as smooth as you would expect from a Square Enix game. the 60fps is definitely noticable having played it at a now considerably less smooth 30fps on console. The anti-aliasing is also a great touch going all the way up to 16x to wipe away the jaggies that 7th gen console games are known for. Having not actually changed the textures of the game (which still look fine for 2014), don't worry about raising the settings and experiencing lag because as long as you meet the recommended, pump up that AA. The shadows resolution goes all the way up to 8k creating crisp player shadows suring fights and walking around. And last but not least, being able to run this game natively 1080p is a dream come true. Given the astonishing beauty of this game even on console, a 1080p version of it makes it all the better and really turns this game into a piece of art.\n\nNow as for cons, just wish that they would have tweaked the gameplay just a bit like the camera control which is still god-awful. All it wants to do is reset back to center. Might as well have a fixed camera. I would have liked better camera control to admire the beautiful scenery this game has to offer. Also speeding up the gameplay such as making paradigm shifts smoother like in XIII-2 would have been nice. Instead you have the long drawn-out shifts. Also I would have liked to see them up the amount of Gil you get from treasure chests or maybe throw in Gil when you win a battle. Gil shortage was a huge problem in the console version and required endless hours of Trapezohedron and Plat ingot hunting to get enough to get everyone's final weapons. On console, I put about 120 hrs into a single playthrough of this game and probably more than 20 of it was grinding for money... This game was obviously a copy and paste port, but at the price point, can't blame them.\n\nGiven there are no bugs so far and the game looks better and plays just as well as on console, I give the port a 9/10 and the game a 8/10. For a final fantasy game story wise, 7.5/10.\n\nMy RIG\ni5-3570K 3.5GHz Quad\n8GB RAM\nGIGABYTE GTX 770 2GB OC Edition\n120GB SSD (only for Windows launch though)\n2TB Hard Drive for storage\nASRock Extreme3 MoBo","February 10, 2015","true","93.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's combat style is quick paced and interesting to watch but can unfortunately become a tedious mash of auto battle unless you are looking for the best strategies to consistantly 5 star your fights and boss battles in epic strategic frustration.\n\nIt's story is based mostly on the development of characters' morals and their reason to "keep on fighting" but other than that we are left quite in the dark about the history of Cocoon and Gran Pulse which would have been amazing to flesh out and bring to life within the game. I have yet to finish FF XIII-2 or play Lightning Returns to see how the world fleshes out but it is an interesting and exciting universe.\n\nHowever, it's linearity is frustrating but offers the same number of options previous Final Fantasy games offered for early game story. The length of the "tutorial" as seen by a lot of the public to be the first 9 or so chapters can be quickly played through with dodges and correct combinations of upgrades in less than 4 hours but this requires a lot of skill and strategy of a later playthrough. So for your first time sitting through expect a 15 hour + "tutorial" but with a lot of "annoying" characters that have you screaming "ughhh, not you again" to "why won't you just die!"\n\nOverall, I enjoyed my experience with the computer ported game as it ran just as smoothly and even smoother in most parts than my previous Xbox360 could handle and also displayed in better resolution when I have quite a weak laptop for such displays. I barely experienced lag so far in my play and found this still to be one of my favourite games.","March 12, 2015","true","29.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

No joke. Okay, I wanted to give a Final Fantasy game a try too.\n\nI was very pleasantly surprised.\n\nYes, the game has it's shortcomings. The vast majority of the game has you running down "corridors" because the game is THAT linear. Yes, the story is a bit confusing to begin with, but once you get into the swing of things it picks up quite well (there's always the internet/datalog to assist you). Yes, the meat of the gameplay doesn't really begin to surface until a few hours in when you can manage your team and get into the bigger fights. Yes, there is a bit of grinding towards the end as the difficulty curve increases sharply.\n\nHowever, after all that you still have an interesting game with unique and fleshed-out characters, with a fantastic musical score, in-depth lore, emotion-invoking story, immersive graphics, and intense gameplay to boot! I was really happy with my purchase and it took me a good 30-40 hours to complete the game first time around. In fact, at the time I couldn't help but pray for a sequel (which, it turns out, wasn't as good and XIII was in fact best as a standalone story).\n\nIf you like Final Fantasy or game's with fantastic story/cutscenes, I whole-heartedly recommend this game. For the price, I recommend just trying it out anyway even if it isn't your usual cup of tea!","March 16, 2015","true","19.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Ruled by benevloent creatures called fal'Cie, players follow a commando, Lightning, and the people she meets as they are touched and turned into l'Cie, or touched warriors, by a Pulse fal'Cie that had hidden on Cacoon for ages.\n\nThe combat system features some FF staples such as Phoenix Downs, summons, and certain magics, but instead of picking abilities individually, most players will likely be auto-attacking. Instead, the challenge comes from its Role system, or Paradigms. Paradigms are customized for each party, and rather than selecting attacks, players will be juggling roles among their characters fairly heavily. The result is a little different from other FFs, but it's fast-paced, pretty fun, and can get fairly difficult if role combinations don't pit well against tougher fights. Characters can then be leveled up by putting points into their various roles.\n\nPerhaps the biggest criticism with the game comes from the exploration, as this is where XIII splits from previous titles. Instead of an open world environment, players are set along linear paths with little room to move about. There are no World Maps, airships to control, or forests filled with random battles to get lost in. It feels nothing like Final Fantasies in that that regard.\n\nHowever, franchise name aside, the maps tend to work. Most jRPGs are simply "Go From Point A to Point B" to begin with, even with World Maps. The tunnels make it easier to play in shorter bursts for people with busy lives, and they keep players from forgetting where to go if they put the game down for a few weeks. The game does open up significantly in Chapter 11, but for the most part the game trims the fat and focuses on the fights and getting through the story.\n\nIt helps that the environments and character models are gorgeous. With the PC fixes/patches, everything is beautifully rendered with smooth models and bright color palette. The characters themselves are highly engaging (though some take longer to warm up to than others), and there's a great deal of cuteness scattered throughout. Even with the hallway maps, there is a great deal of content, and players can expect to spend 60+ hours easily to finish.\n\nI highly recommend this game if players can put the "Final Fantasy" name aside. There are certainly some great traditional FF elements here - big swords, Cid, a Moogleworks shop - but it doesn't feel like the classic games. That's perfectly ok. It's well worth the price when taken to be its own jRPG.","February 22, 2015","true","30.9"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

People say this game is boring because of that option, but if you don't use it the game is much better. Everyone complains about the linearity of the game and I knew about it but I didn't know exactly what they meant, so here is what they mean by linear. In most other FF games you can freely go to towns or villages that you have previously been to but this games is just forward all the time. There are no towns, no safe areas, no shops, or anything like that. Just the characters running pretty much down a hallway. The only "stops" are save points along the path that also serves as a shop.

If you know you're not the kind of person that can handle linearity, do not pick up this title. The game has 13 Chapters, however the game only opens up at Chapter 11. Chapter 1~10 is all about getting used to the battle system and all about the storytelling.The world is really greatly thought out with some really great visuals. Masahi Hamauzu also did a great job with the soundtracks, following in the footsteps of Nobuo Uematsu.The soundtrack is simply awesome.\nThe story and characters are basically FF. Many people say the story is too convoluted, however if you follow the game's pacing everything will be handed on a plate, overall not a bad storyline.The characters are quite interesting and there are rooms for character development.\nThe battle system is quite different in a way it is really fast and frantic. It would seem like full-on buttle mashing but it has a lot of interesting approaches to a battle.The battle system is still a love or hate relationship, if you're considering this title, check up some gameplay on the Internet first.\nOverall, I do enjoy this title and will recommend it to diehard FF fans.

The game will take up a big amount of GB, around 50. Yes, that is much, because of the many cutscenes this game has. The game has a good and interesting story, maybe a bit confusing at times if you don't pay attention, but luckily, you can reread all of it in the game itself; so if you take a break from playing the game, coming back to it later and don't know what's going on, it's easy getting back into.\nThe battle system is pretty cool. You can only control one character in battle, but that's not a bad thing, since the battles are still pretty busy when you're fighting enemies.\nIt is true that you don't have a lot of freedom in the game when it comes to exploration, it is pretty linear, but on the other side, it gives the story enough time to unfold itself.\nThe characters are all individual; one is funny, the other one may be more serious, etc. I'm sure you'll find someone you like. My personal favorite is Lightning.\nAll in all, I like the approach that this game in the Final Fantasy series is taking. Alot of times, people complain about that games and their sequels are too similar, so why not change something once in a while?\nI hope you have as much fun with this game like me.","January 4, 2015","true","42.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

For example, you could have a very offensive paradigm with one physical attacker and two ravagers, a very defensive one with a medic, a synergist and a sentinel or something in between; during the battle you can switch at any point in time among up to six different paradigms. Much different than what I just said about the prologue now, isn't it? =D\n\nIn conclusion... if you like JRPGs and good stories, and you can bear map linearity give this game a chance. It's a good one.\n\nMy vote: 8 / 10","January 25, 2015","true","59.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

I am an anime fan and of course I like the voice acting and the classic music is fantastic. Interesting place or setting for the game.\n\nCons\n\nIt was very LINEAR, its like u just following a long straight path. Character motive is difficult to understand.Weird leveling system, u couldn't upgrade what u want.\n\nOverall this grame is great but like I mentioned above its not too great to be ur JRPG.

Good combat, good art style, bad pacing, bad level design, bad story, bad characters.\n\nBy far the best combat I've run into in a Final Fantasy game (I absolutely loved the Paradigm system), but there's just too much of it. This game consists of about 50 hours worth of hallways with a meaningless throwaway battle every ten steps.\n\nIt briefly breaks out of the hallways around the 25-hour mark, opening up the game a bunch and giving you an opportunity to do more meaningless combat until you've leveled up enough to continue. Once you've done a sufficient amount of grinding, it's back to the hallways.\n\nThe characters weren't interesting. Out of six characters, only two of them were even believable as human beings. The rest were hamfisted caricatures that seemed to be written by a checklist.   The two person-esque characters still weren't anything special.\n\nOne of the characters is a scantily-clad 14-year-old girl who moans, sighs, and grunts sexually, nonstop, in every single cutscene. If you weren't watching the cutscenes, it would have you convinced that someone was having sex in the background of every single cutscene she's in.\n\nThe story is nonsensical. It meanders tediously, relying entirely on the characters inexplicably wandering to places they have no reason to go to. Over and over and over. Repeat until, all in one cutscene, each and every major plot point gets abruptly and miraculously tied up without any explanations for how these miracles happened.\n\nDeeply unsatisfying.","March 29, 2015","false","46.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

That said, the game looks amazing with the Durante fix that I'm sure you can find easily by googling.  FPS suffers a bit but not much with the patch, but does drop every now and then, but not enough to ruin the experience (for me at least).   Also, just to put this out there, the alt-tab issue is fixed with the patch, the steam overlay seems to slow down significantly, and hitting escape will still exit the game immediately.\n\nFor those that HAVEN'T played the game before, DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN RPG.  Exploration is near non-existent, you have only a slight choice in building your characters, and during the 'tutorial' that lasts what seems like half the game, you don't even have control over your party as a whole.  There's only slight differences in the stats and abilities of all characters that you will have control over once everyone is fully built.\n\nOn the good side, however, i really enjoy the music and gameplay.   This is one of my favorite FF piano soundtracks, and even though it's not a true RPG, the gameplay is fast paced and does require a small degree of strategy (a little more so on the 'bosses').  The graphics deserve special mention as they are amazing.  Once again, you realy need the fix because the default steam version looks AWFUL compared to even the xbox's version.  And the story... oh the story... It has so much potential and is just a convoluted mess.   And don't get me started on the characters.  This may be a shoo-in for having at least some of the most shallow FF characters of all time, and easily has one of the most annoying.\n\nSo do I recommend it? Yep.  Just make sure you know what you're getting yourself into though!","October 17, 2014","true","32.2"," 4 of 8 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","4","8","0","0"

Not because it is a bad game but because it is slightly different from your traditional RPG. In a way, you really only need to press 1 button during combat. Sqauare Enix does a nice job incorporating mechanics that make, even single button, combat enjoyable. All in all, its a hit or miss. I think this is probably one of the few Final Fantasy games out there where you don't necessarily need to be a Final Fantasy fan or an RPG fan in order to thuroughly enjoy. It's a great game for the casual gamer (like me).\n\nI would recommend this to anyone. The game has a good story - with a bit of reworking it could be a good movie on the big screen. The game has characters that we love (besides Vanilla since no onelikes her VA - I don't have a problem with it though).

But the good parts are sparkly and great.\n\nI was a little skeptical when I decided to buy the game. I spent at least a week poring over the reviews before I actually bought the review. All of them give the same message : You MIGHT like this game. Good luck.\n\nBasically, the big issue I had was with how tedious some of the gameplay felt. Other than that, it was actually a really great game, with pretty graphics, not-boring (though somewhat confusing and cliche) plot, and a lovely battle system.\n\nThe Plot:\nJust keep running. Just... keep running. Run through monsters. Crush them under your boots, and keep running. Run around them. Sneakily steal loot from treasure orb-chest-things while guarding mob isn't looking. Have issues with your party running away from you or you running away from them like twenty times before reuniting AND STAYING THAT WAY.\n\nThen slap the living daylights out of everything while trying to figure out what you're gonna do with the time you have left. You have like a dozen chapters to figure it out and even near the end you got some issues.\n\nThe Verdict:\nI need a lot of CS. Therefore I must grind.\nI need a lot of gil. Therefore I must grind.\nI need equipment. Therefore I must get gil. Therefore I must grind.\n\nYeah, at this point I'm gonna put down the controller and take a break. Probably play something else then come back and grind intensely.\n\nThe slight tediousness is what kills the experience a little. The battle system is fun, but of course too much of a good thing gets tiring. Until you get the freedom to rearrange your party, around chapter 10 and 11, the whole game feels like a very, very long tutorial. It's great because the monsters are little weak babies, but then whammo you fall out of the sky into Pulse and there's Behemoths in pairs and giant turtoises dominating the plains. Whee. More running.\n\nI loved it at first, then slowly got kinda tired of it. I'll grow to love it again, but then the cycle'll keep going.\n\nSo yeah, fair warning about buying it.\n\n\n\n","February 15, 2015","true","43.4"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

I think that this game is what most folks who know the series have come to expect.  Yes, it is straight forward, but the story is rich as is with most JRPGs.\n\nThe environments are gorgeous. The battle system is rather simplistic at first, but quickly becomes more interesting.  The characters are cool and mostly not annoying, which is appealing to me.  I cannot wait to finish the game to move further into the series.\n\nI recommend this to people who like Final Fantasay games.","December 25, 2015","true","109.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

It's kind of hard to persuade people in this situation because the problems this game has I don't really pay attention to. Also for the price it's at I doubt anyone would be interested.\n\nPlot-Personally I liked it, it was something different as to what I have played before, really I don't have a problem with it. However that is one to be disagreed with because according to some people it's hard to understand, which I can relate to at times.\nGameplay-One of the major problems in the game for me. Yes, the game does have a very nice switching paradigm system but it's all dumbed down by the fact that you can just auto-battle and win.\nGraphics-I love this game's graphics, the enemies, the surroundings. When you get to Chapter 11 you will see how great it is however it will take a LONG time to get there and when I got there my fps dropped substantially.\nCharacters-I believe most people have problems with the same ones namely Hope, Vanille and Snow. I can agree with Hope to some degree but he gets less "hopeless" *wink* as time goes on. Vanille is extremely kooky and at first I didn't like her but I started to like her as time went on. Snow is my favourite character but he's a complete idiot.\n\nFinally the part almost everyone has a problem with...corridors. It's all good saying "oh well if you get to chapter 11 it opens up" ok bright idea I will play over 30 hours of your game to get to the fun part, nope, it isn't going to happen. Needless to say I persevered and I tried to ignore it and to be honest I didn't have to try hard. To me as long as a game has interesting parts that keep me preoccupied I couldn't care less about corridors. However that is down to opinion, also one last thing I want to state before jumping to my conclusion, the New-Game+ is good but a few things are getting on my nerves. If you do get to the end and you actually do like it there are a few things you can do afterwards like the remaining quests (stone missions), maxing out COMPLETELY (trust me it's going to take years to do so) and getting all achievements. Where most of my beef comes from is maxing out, it will take ages, there is however a way to speed it up. One of the missions will give a Growth Egg doubling xp so when you need it is when your low levelled (logic). However that's where the problem comes in, to beat the boss that drops it you can either be almost maxed out (if so what's the point of the reward) or test your luck at getting a 1% chance instant kill move. Good Luck...\n\nSo I can only really say buy the game if you can look past its problems which I did but I am not saying it will work for you. I liked it because I tried to look past all of it and in the end I succeeded, I came out pleased. I was stuck on what to give this because in many ways it can be considered a really bad game. Its lacklustre start will put of most people but as long as you can endure it until the half way point hopefully it will start to change your mind. I reccommend it just purely because I found it fun. Even though I have covered more than a few things to me the game has so much more good things about it than bad.","December 26, 2015","true","87.2"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

For example, you could have a very offensive paradigm with one physical attacker and two ravagers, a very defensive one with a medic, a synergist and a sentinel or something in between; during the battle you can switch at any point in time among up to six different paradigms. Much different than what I just said about the prologue now, isn't it? =D\n\nIn conclusion... if you like JRPGs and good stories, and you can bear map linearity give this game a chance. It's a good one.\n\nMy vote: 8 / 10","January 25, 2015","true","59.4"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","1"

I hope to see that in this game but rather get the same experience, i got it alittle boring.

Whether you like it or dislike it, there will always be a large number of people waiting to hate you for it. But I'll share my thoughts at least:\nI personally feel like 9 or 10 was the last true Final Fantasy game, then the world map disappeared, the battle system changed repeatedly, and of course, most areas became boring corridors in FF13.\nI wasn't a big fan of 12, but it was still fine, and so far (about half way through the game, I think), I dislike 13 more than any other Final Fantasy that has come before it. However, my thoughts continue to change on it as I get further...\n\nI started off very unimpressed by the boring areas, lack of exploration, annoying characters (or lack of personality, in Lightning's case), and I hated the battle system. I always enjoyed strategically giving commands to all my characters individually, but in this game, you only control the leader, and pretty much just give suggestions to the other party members. Granted, they're actually quite smart sometimes, but I just feel like I would be a lot more comfortable knowing exactly what everybody is going to do.\n\nBut as I got further, I started to accept things a bit more. The battle system is quite clever in some ways, the areas start to get slightly more interesting (I think), and despite what people say, there is actually some character development. I never thought I'd say it, but I've warmed up to the game, and even Lightning's character.\nBut at the same time, I think this is still my least favourite Final Fantasy (I've not played any other game in the FF13 trilogy yet). In fact, it's probably one of my least favourite JRPGs in general. And yet, I feel like the good parts are so good that it's still enjoyable and worth my time.\n\nAnyway, I'm far from an experienced reviewer or anything, but to anybody on the fence about whether or not to try this game, I'd say:\nGive it a go, but be patient with it. There were times when I just wanted to stop playing and give up on it, but I've continued onward and am enjoying it more than expected, for the most part. Give the characters a chance, even at their most obnoxious and whiny. They become more bearable, at least to me.\n\nAnd that's about all I can think of to say about this game. I hope it helped in any way at all, but if not, oh well... I'm just sharing my opinion online, leave me alone!

The story starts with Lightning (the main protagonist of FFXIII) battle the PSICOM soldiers during the turmoil caused by an event called "The Purge". And as the story progresses, other characters appear to fight off the PSICOM soldiers. Don't worry, I won't spoil you any of the plot.\n\nExpect a bit of confusion since the game starts throwing events at you immeadiately. But as you progress through the story, you'll begin to understand bit by bit why they are fighting for such a cause. Each character or should I say a member of your party has their own reason for fighting off their current foes.\n\nJust like any Final Fantasy game, FFXIII has its own battle system but you only control one character of your party. The game distinguishes the members of your party into roles and the only one you take control of is the Leader. The FFXIII focuses more on formation and the debut of the Paradigm Shift. The Paradigm Shift is a unique battle feature of FFXIII where your party sets up formations applicable to your current situation. As the leader, you have the command to change paradigms suited to the situation or your style of battle. Unlike other Final Fantasy games that involve many characters, FFXIII mostly restricts you to the characters available during the plot or scenario. Since the game is very linear, your party maybe split into multiple teams either alone, by pair or by trio depending on how the plot goes.\n\nThe level up system is also linear since the game somehow adapted Final Fantasy X's crystal level up system. The main difference is that in FFXIII, each character has their own roles and each role has its own crystal level up system. So if Lightning has 4 different roles, then you have 4 level up systems for Lightning.\n\nAgain, the game very much linear. Digging very deep into the storyline. The game still features an open world but you'll have to grind down up to Chapter 11 to play it. By the way, the game has 12 chapters all in all.\n\nSome Updates of Game:\n+ O and X buttons are now well distanguished when using the Asian or Western controls.\n+ The "ESC" button issue has now been resolved.\n+ The game graphics can now be adjusted to suit your PCs.\n\nMy own rating:\nGraphics: 10/10\nMusic: 10/10\nGameplay: 7/10\nStory: 9/10\nOverall: 9/10\n\nI recommend this game to big fans of Final Fantasy games. If you love dwelling deeper into the storyline and want to experience the new innovation of the Final Fantasy Series, then this is the game for you. If you prefer the traditional way then, this game will surely disappoint you since it IS very linear and very much attached to the storyline. And don't worry about the game's price because this game is very much worth every penny with the game spanning to more than 100 hours of gameplay and the tough boss battles that can span for more than an hour.\n\nIf you loved this game, then continue on with the 2nd part of the trilogy, Final Fantasy XIII-2.","December 23, 2014","true","37.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I have played a couple of other FF games but once you play X or XIII it is hard to go back to the older ones. Final Fantasy lived up to my hopes that it would be comparable to X. While many people complain about the linearity of the game and the limit to exploration, I think it is fine. When I played this game I played it for the story, which is possibly my favorite story of any game I have ever played, all of the characters are unique and pull you into the story. I originally played this game on Xbox 360 and bought it on PC when it came out. While the PC port is sort of lazy, but they have improved it greatly. Compared to the Xbox version the graphics look incredible and really show how beautiful this game is. The soundtrack is one of the best I have heard and I love all of the songs and the scenes that they correspond to. The visuals in the game are gorgeous and the CGI cut scenes are so realistic and incredibly good looking. There are about 7 hours of cut scenes on their own. The sequels to this game are also similar, they have great stories and even better, more polished gameplay. The combat system works well and is very fun. End game there is plenty to do if you are one who likes farming to get the best gear and clearing all of the missions and objectives. I absolutely love this game and it will definitely play with your emotions and make you want to keep playing. This is in my Top 5 games of all time.\n\nPros:\n- Incredible story that has many plot twists and changes\n- Very developed and unique characters\n- Decent replayability with farming and gear\n- Great visuals\n- Stunning cutscenes\n- Great Soundtrack\n- long story (30-35 hours)\n\nCons:\n- Linear story\n- Below average port\n\nVisuals:           9/10\nAudio:             9.5/10\nCutscenes:      10/10\nGameplay:       7.5/10\nStory:              10/10\nReplayability:   4/5\nSolo:                N/A\nCo-op/Multiplayer: N/A\nBalance:             N/A\n\n\n\nOverall Score: 91/100","February 15, 2015","true","45.1"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Performance is terrible even on most powerful PCs although this game is several years old. The engine also stutters every few seconds if you don't plug-in a controller or use a virtual (fake) one. Also the game provides very little graphic customization options.\nBeing a very bad port is the only downside of this game. Final Fantasy XIII is one of the best JRPG titles ever released and has won several awards. If you manage to get over the troubled shell, you will find a beautiful gem inside.\n\nGameplay: 9/10\n\nGameplay structure is a bit different than most RPG & JRPG titles available on the market. Most of your playtime will be spent battling various monsters and enemies through game's innovative battle system called ATB (Active Time Battle). ATB is closer to Turn-Based gameplay of traditional JRPG games rather than Real-Time. Your party consists of two or three characters, of which only the leader can be controlled. The rest of your party is controlled by AI which does a pretty good job.\nThe progression speed of the game is very slow which can frustrate impatient and casual players. Game takes a very long time to unlocks all of its gameplay features. It's basically like a very long tutorial that makes up for almost half of your playtime before showing you the true game. Final Fantasy 13 is mostly linear with paths filled with enemies and a cut-scene at the end.\nOverall, gameplay is very addictive and rewarding. It's a difficult game to fully accomplish and some of the optional bosses and enemies need a lot of grinding to defeat.\n\nStory & Lore: 10/10\n\nStory is where Final Fantasy titles shine, Final Fantasy 13 is no exception. It has a very expansive lore and a really intriguing story. Although it may be a little hard to grasp for newcomers, it's what you would remember for a long time once you understand its true nature. Characters are presented in a very good way and as they develop, story becomes more and more interesting.\nFinal Fantasy 13 is like a living, breathing world that you can live in.\n\nVisuals & Graphics: 8/10\n\nThe original game is a relatively old title so we can't except cutting-edge technology and mind-blowing visuals. However, the art design of the game is simply fantastic. As with most Japanese titles, a lot of work has been put into art design. Every single monster you encounter looks alive, every single character you see look real. The world is very beautiful.\nUnfortunately, the technical aspect of the game and its weak engine can't really catch up with today's standards but the art design can easily make up for it.\n\nAudio & Music: 10/10\n\nAgain, another area in which Final Fantasy titles have always been great is music. Soundtrack is amazing and you feel like you want to listen to it over and over again. Sound Effects are great too and Voice Acting is professional. Both Japanese and English voice actors should be proud of their work.\n\nOverall Score (Conclusion): 7.5/10\n\nFinal Fantasy 13 is one of the best JRPG games that I've ever played, however the PC port feels very rushed and is done terribly. It still doesn't make the game itself a bad title, but the PC release is really a weak port. I'd recommend getting it on the console if you haven't played it already (and own a console, of course) but if you don't have a console, well PC seems to be your only choice.","December 14, 2014","true","180.4"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

Good combat, good art style, bad pacing, bad level design, bad story, bad characters.\n\nBy far the best combat I've run into in a Final Fantasy game (I absolutely loved the Paradigm system), but there's just too much of it. This game consists of about 50 hours worth of hallways with a meaningless throwaway battle every ten steps.\n\nIt briefly breaks out of the hallways around the 25-hour mark, opening up the game a bunch and giving you an opportunity to do more meaningless combat until you've leveled up enough to continue. Once you've done a sufficient amount of grinding, it's back to the hallways.\n\nThe characters weren't interesting. Out of six characters, only two of them were even believable as human beings. The rest were hamfisted caricatures that seemed to be written by a checklist.   The two person-esque characters still weren't anything special.\n\nOne of the characters is a scantily-clad 14-year-old girl who moans, sighs, and grunts sexually, nonstop, in every single cutscene. If you weren't watching the cutscenes, it would have you convinced that someone was having sex in the background of every single cutscene she's in.\n\nThe story is nonsensical. It meanders tediously, relying entirely on the characters inexplicably wandering to places they have no reason to go to. Over and over and over. Repeat until, all in one cutscene, each and every major plot point gets abruptly and miraculously tied up without any explanations for how these miracles happened.\n\nDeeply unsatisfying.","March 29, 2015","false","46.5"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","1"

This game has 13 chapter, the gameplay is long, and some bosses are quite hard, and this is not a joke.  People will say ooo this game is easy and all that, but don't be fooled by the reviews user give out on public.  I've been playing this game for about 30 hours total.  I love the battle system, the characters are great, and I must say it is a bit different from other final fantasy games, but not extirely.\n\nI don't see why all the hate towards this game, I really love this game.  It has a very addictive battle system and leveling up the storyline is actually great, and not confusing like many will say.\n\nI got confused as I started Final Fantasy XIII-2 on Xbox 360 back in the day and almost finished it, but was entirely confused as I didn't played the first one lulz.  Now I'm playing it on PC which is better on, and I just bought FFXIII-2, so I can't wait to finish up FFXIII and jump on FFXIII-2 on PC, I never played the 2nd one on PC, and very excited to play it again because I will now understand the first part of the story.\n\nI say get this game it is a very amazing game, and Yes i'm all possitive for this game its one of the best graphics i ever seen in a final fantasy game, and it is pretty damn good!\n\nThanks for reading my Review, and I hope more and more people actually put the real positive truth of this game.  If you are a JRPG gamer and a fan of Final Fantasy, it is one big collection to add on steam :)\n\nIt is also the biggest Final Fantasy game ever made.","July 1, 2015","true","64.3"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Though after a almost 2 hours of playing I realized all i was doing was hitting 1 button fast while in combat and then using a potion as needed every 9 or 10 fights. This I can look past since final fantasy games for me has always been more about the story that pulls you in and the sense of accomplishment you get when you overcome the various hurdles thrown in your path for character development. This game failed miserably in providing either one of those.\nThis game has you change main characters every 15 to 25 minutes during the first few hours of play. There is no depth, it's full of cliches, and lacks from any sense of cohesion that could possibly be existant in a storyline except for the fact that there is a war going on inside a city somewhere. I'm sure if I devoted my time in reading all of the background articles the game wants you to spend reading I could of gleaned additional information, but I bought this game to be entertained via cinematics and gameplay. I did not want to be informed of key elements of the story via stopping game play to look up the excessive amounts of datalog files...\nAll things considered I found this to be the first Final Fantasy game I've played that was not enjoyable.

Game runs smooth and haven't run into any problems.  My only complaint about this installment in the FF series is that it's VERY linear.  It's not much of a problem for me since I like to focus on the story just as much if not more than the gameplay but it might be a turn-off for some.  You're in for many hours of being lead down a narrow path before you can get to a point where you can explore on your own.\n\nThere are a couple or characters I couldn't care less about so it's a bit of a bummer when I'm forced to have them in the party but luckily if you neglect them they still get points they can spend to increase their skills when the others fight.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/lefaust06/recommended/292120/","lefaust06","LeFaust","http://steamcommunity.com/id/lefaust06/","129 products in account","FF XIII is not a "traditional" Final Fantasy game in the sense that it places the story front and center for the vast majority of the game. This is different than other FF games in that the battle systems, mini-games, character abilities, and exploration are primarily hands-off affairs for the first 15+ hours. Once that period is over, there is a rich game to explore and delve into, but it takes time and not everyone will be up for the investment it takes to get there.\nHere's the breakdown section by section:\n\nStory\nThe majority of the story in FF XIII happens between the characters that you control and the group of seemingly antagonistic entities known as Fal'Cie. There is quite a bit that happens that would take far too long to detail, but know that this is a pretty story-rich game with decent character development and a satisfying story arc for each character. That said, there isn't a lot of explanation of the backstory for the world, the Fal'Cie, and environments that happens in-game, which leaves the player with questions. There is much, much more information that can be gained by reading the datalogs in the menu, but it can be quite tedious and it's a shame that there wasn't more of this information put in the actual game. Clearly this game asks for a large amount of time from the player, would it have been that much more onerous to explain the inner-workings of the game's world to the user without resorting to datalogs?\n\n\nBattles\nThe battle system for a FF game is a good one. Similar to FF XII you are only in control of one of your three party members at a time, with the computer taking over for the other two. You can assign "paradigms" to your party, with one of six being active at any one time, with the ability to switch to others mid-battle. This system works well throughout the entire storyline, but can occasionally cause problems when attempting optional late-game content. In some late-game scenarios it would be extremely helpful to have more control over the other two members of your party, and sometimes you might have to retry battles due to computer players making bad decisions.\n\n\nExtras\nAs stated earlier, there is a point late in the game in which you can explore/grind/take on side missions that really shines. This section of the game really feels more like a final fantasy game than the rest, and if you're a fan of the series then this section will definitely scratch your itch for more FF. If you're not a veteran, than this area still holds some value and interest if you're enjoying the RPG aspects of the game and want to go further. While some people might argue that it was frustrating to leave this section until the later parts of the game, I think it was actually a good idea. Players who only want to experience the story can do so and can completely ignore this section of the game. While others who want the ability to ignore the story for a bit and develop their characters and inventory further can do so without the worry of having missed certain items or content earlier in the game. With all the "missables" of previous FF games being a frustration to completionists (especially FFXII with the Zodiac Spear nonsense), leaving this content until later works out really well. There are plenty of challenging side-missions and achievements to hunt that will satisfy all but the most hardcore of FF fan.","September 7, 2015","true","123.0"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

If you know you're not the kind of person that can handle linearity, do not pick up this title. The game has 13 Chapters, however the game only opens up at Chapter 11. Chapter 1~10 is all about getting used to the battle system and all about the storytelling.The world is really greatly thought out with some really great visuals. Masahi Hamauzu also did a great job with the soundtracks, following in the footsteps of Nobuo Uematsu.The soundtrack is simply awesome.\nThe story and characters are basically FF. Many people say the story is too convoluted, however if you follow the game's pacing everything will be handed on a plate, overall not a bad storyline.The characters are quite interesting and there are rooms for character development.\nThe battle system is quite different in a way it is really fast and frantic. It would seem like full-on buttle mashing but it has a lot of interesting approaches to a battle.The battle system is still a love or hate relationship, if you're considering this title, check up some gameplay on the Internet first.\nOverall, I do enjoy this title and will recommend it to diehard FF fans. For gamers new to the series however, I strongly advise you to do extensive research before picking up. The game is still great but it may not be your taste.

That said, the game looks amazing with the Durante fix that I'm sure you can find easily by googling.  FPS suffers a bit but not much with the patch, but does drop every now and then, but not enough to ruin the experience (for me at least).   Also, just to put this out there, the alt-tab issue is fixed with the patch, the steam overlay seems to slow down significantly, and hitting escape will still exit the game immediately.\n\nFor those that HAVEN'T played the game before, DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AN RPG.  Exploration is near non-existent, you have only a slight choice in building your characters, and during the 'tutorial' that lasts what seems like half the game, you don't even have control over your party as a whole.  There's only slight differences in the stats and abilities of all characters that you will have control over once everyone is fully built.\n\nOn the good side, however, i really enjoy the music and gameplay.   This is one of my favorite FF piano soundtracks, and even though it's not a true RPG, the gameplay is fast paced and does require a small degree of strategy (a little more so on the 'bosses').  The graphics deserve special mention as they are amazing.  Once again, you realy need the fix because the default steam version looks AWFUL compared to even the xbox's version.  And the story... oh the story... It has so much potential and is just a convoluted mess.   And don't get me started on the characters.  This may be a shoo-in for having at least some of the most shallow FF characters of all time, and easily has one of the most annoying.\n\nSo do I recommend it? Yep.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/redsoul41here/recommended/292120/","redsoul41here","redsoul41","http://steamcommunity.com/id/redsoul41here/","191 products in account","Final Fantasy XIII is the first part of the Final Fantasy XIII trilogy. The story starts with Lightning (the main protagonist of FFXIII) battle the PSICOM soldiers during the turmoil caused by an event called "The Purge". And as the story progresses, other characters appear to fight off the PSICOM soldiers. Don't worry, I won't spoil you any of the plot.\n\nExpect a bit of confusion since the game starts throwing events at you immeadiately. But as you progress through the story, you'll begin to understand bit by bit why they are fighting for such a cause. Each character or should I say a member of your party has their own reason for fighting off their current foes.\n\nJust like any Final Fantasy game, FFXIII has its own battle system but you only control one character of your party. The game distinguishes the members of your party into roles and the only one you take control of is the Leader. The FFXIII focuses more on formation and the debut of the Paradigm Shift. The Paradigm Shift is a unique battle feature of FFXIII where your party sets up formations applicable to your current situation. As the leader, you have the command to change paradigms suited to the situation or your style of battle. Unlike other Final Fantasy games that involve many characters, FFXIII mostly restricts you to the characters available during the plot or scenario. Since the game is very linear, your party maybe split into multiple teams either alone, by pair or by trio depending on how the plot goes.\n\nThe level up system is also linear since the game somehow adapted Final Fantasy X's crystal level up system. The main difference is that in FFXIII, each character has their own roles and each role has its own crystal level up system. So if Lightning has 4 different roles, then you have 4 level up systems for Lightning.\n\nAgain, the game very much linear. Digging very deep into the storyline. The game still features an open world but you'll have to grind down up to Chapter 11 to play it. By the way, the game has 12 chapters all in all.\n\nSome Updates of Game:\n+ O and X buttons are now well distanguished when using the Asian or Western controls.\n+ The "ESC" button issue has now been resolved.\n+ The game graphics can now be adjusted to suit your PCs.\n\nMy own rating:\nGraphics: 10/10\nMusic: 10/10\nGameplay: 7/10\nStory: 9/10\nOverall: 9/10\n\nI recommend this game to big fans of Final Fantasy games. If you love dwelling deeper into the storyline and want to experience the new innovation of the Final Fantasy Series, then this is the game for you. If you prefer the traditional way then, this game will surely disappoint you since it IS very linear and very much attached to the storyline. And don't worry about the game's price because this game is very much worth every penny with the game spanning to more than 100 hours of gameplay and the tough boss battles that can span for more than an hour.\n\nIf you loved this game, then continue on with the 2nd part of the trilogy, Final Fantasy XIII-2.","December 23, 2014","true","37.8"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

Options are also changed in the launcher, which means that you can't change them in the game. The game runs at 60fps.\n(It might be that the resolution goes higher than 1080p and it just doesn't show them to me because I have a 1080p monitor. Let me know if this is the case.)\n\nPerformance is poor, as a result of very poor PC optimization. Some people have reported that they are running this with smooth 60fps, but other people have reported huge performance issues even with high-end machines. I myself am getting around 30fps. What seems to be causing this is the UI, which is in some way bugged, and disabling the UI via a thirdy party program actually gives me a huge performance increase. However, you obviously can't play the game without the UI. This is something that Square should really look in to and fix it. FFXIII is not an action game so I found that bareable, but your opinion (and performance) may vary. I'd never play an action focused game at 30fps.\n\nThere is still no audio options, which is a problem for some people. There's also both Japanese and English audio, although this heavily increases the file size.\nThe game is roughly 50gb, so that might a problem for you if you have a small hard-drive or a slow internet connection.\n\nKeyboard and mouse controls are functionable, although I found playing with a controller much more pleasant.\nKeyboard and mouse controls are mostly rebindable. Mostly. You can't rebind movement controls from WASD (or whatever AZERTY uses) and selection keys, which are left and right mouse buttons. I really don't see this as a problem because, honestly, would you actually ever rebind those? Rest of the keys are fully rebindable.\n\nSo yeah, the port is still very barebones, but if you can deal with that, I think that the game is worth playing.\n\nReview of the actual game:\n\nFinal Fantasy XIII is a very story focused game, so if this is not what you are looking for, I wouldn't recommend the game for you. First eleven chapters of the game are very linear, but this allowed them to focus on the story telling in a way that would not have been possible on a more open game, although at times even I found this linearity fairly dull. I actually quite enjoyed the story of the game.\n\nI have one problem with the characters though. In my opinion, Final Fantasy XIII has five well written characters, and then there is Lightning. I just found her incredibly boring character, and aside from one scene in around chapter 4 or something with Hope, she received practically zero character development. This would not be a huge problem if she wouldn't happen to also be the main character of the game. On the other hand, I found all the other characters very well written.\n\nCombat system of the game is fairly unique, and while it starts out as very repetitive, I did find it quite interesting after a while. Although I must recommend that do not use "Auto-Battle" button. Just don't, that makes the combat very dull and isn't always the most optional option anyway. I have some minor problems with it though, biggest one being that you can't change your party leader/controlled character during the combat. I heart that this is changed in FFXIII-2, so I'm quite looking forward to that.\n\nSoundtrack of the game was in my opinion also very good, although thanks to the sound balance (which you can not change due to lack of audio options), it's not quite as loud as I would have liked.\n\nAs I said, the game is very linear, but honestly, the side quests that the game introduces in chapter 11 are very dull. I got obsessed with it and got all the achivements, but I really do not recommend that. It is very grindy and takes countless of hours and hours, and hours of time. There is a reason why only 0,64% have the Treasure Hunter achievement. Just, don't do it. Play through the story and do those few side quests (Cie'th Stone missions) that you do during it, and leave it at that.\n\nIn the end, I enjoyed FFXIII, despite its faults. Thanks to the linearity, I found some of the chapters fairly boring and doing all the side quests definitely wasn't enjoyable, but the story, combat, and the characters (aside from Lighting) were quite good. I do recommend the game, at least to fans of JRPGs.","December 11, 2014","true","98.6"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tumalu/recommended/292120/","Tumalu","Tumalu","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Tumalu/","1165 products in account","First of all, I would like to start by saying that I did enjoy this game. There are certain problems that can be deal breakers to many people, so I went with "Not Recommended", which I will explain why below.\n\nBeautiful graphics. The soundtrack is magnificent, as with any Final Fantasy game. The voice acting and plot development was just okay to me.\n\nWarning: The game will freeze every few seconds for about a second (referred to as "stuttering" on the community forums) unless the game detects a gamepad plugged in.\n\nThe port to PC isn't particularly great, but can be looked over. I use keyboard controls myself, which can take some time to get used to. The keyboard controls cannot be remapped. You shouldn't have a problem if you're using a gamepad though. Also, pressing escape at any point during the game will open a prompt to close the game, so be careful about accidentally closing it.\n\nThe game is as linear as they say. You'll mostly be traveling down a single path for a good part of the game. This doesn't give much room for those that love to explore and find hidden treasures. Eventually, you will get to a point where the game becomes more open world, but the world itself can be a bit overwhelming. You may run into monsters that you'll have no chance of beating until later on in the game, so pick your battles wisely. You'll also be spending a lot of time just running around the map.\n\nThe game feels like it's about 50% running, 40% combat, and 10% cutscenes. Running and combat doesn't add too much to the game, so you could probably just watch the cutscenes and still understand the plot. The running around doesn't bother me because the scenery in the game is absolutely beautiful and very enjoyable.\n\nMy biggest problem is with the combat mechanics. You only play as the party lead, and you don't really have much control over what can be done. One huge problem for me was that you don't have control of character positioning. Therefore, if two or three bombs decide they want to self destruct in front of someone's face, your characters will have no problem just standing there accepting their imminent demise. While this can be remedied by playing with a smarter setup, the lack of character positioning can be annoying. In older Final Fantasy games, you could at least send someone in the back row to deal and receive less damage, so the concept of positioning was there.\n\nThere are a few new mechanics introduced which are definitely worth pointing out. Square seems to enjoy reinventing combat mechanics with each new game. You do have the ability to switch your character's roles at any point during the battle. This can switch your team's behavior from offensive to defensive in order to adapt to the situation of the battle. You can also build up chains on an opponent, which will cause them to become staggered. Staggered oppoents take more damage and get interrupted whenever they are hit, which makes this mechanic pretty important!\n\nNon-party leader characters will do their own thing, which unfortunately, you won't have control of either other than the role they are playing as. This can actually be both good and bad, since the AI will surely be faster at inputting commands (unless you use the Auto-Battle feature). The AI for the Synergist class isn't particularly smart though, and can be a crutch if you need to prioritize offense over defense to achieve a 5 star ranking in a battle (getting a bad ranking doesn't affect your game too much, but it's still nice to try and aim for the best!). Lastly, some battles can also be extremely difficult to the point of frustration, despite the difficulty level being on normal. All in all, the combat feels a bit uninspired as you don't have much control over what's going on.\n\nThe "leveling up" system is fairly linear as well, and may force you to learn skills that you could strategically leave out to specialize certain characters (again, not a huge problem, because it isn't game-breaking).\n\nThe weapon and accessory upgrading feature is pretty interesting and is new to Final Fantasy series, I believe. The upgrading tutorial only covers the basics though, so you could end up wasting a bunch of items unless you're following a guide.\n\nIf you can look past what was mentioned above, then you will enjoy this game. Otherwise, there are better Final Fantasy games out there. Personally, I have a high tolerence level for these kinds of things, so I definitely enjoyed most of the game.","March 15, 2015","false","148.0"," 3 of 6 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","3","6","0","0"

I'll try my best to split the good and bad because i find it easier to point out the bad rather than what i actually like/love about this game. (SPOILERS AHEAD)\n\n\nGood:\n\n-Square Enix hardley ever dissapoint when it comes to delievering a lore and setting for a Final Fantasy title. The whole L'cie concept and how it can result is to me, original. The design of Cocoon and Gran Pulse feel very natural with the story arch alongside the whole Fal'cie and L'cie idea.\n\n-Music. Now this i can say whole heartedly that Square Enix NEVER dissapoint when it comes to scoring a Final Fantasy game. If i were to give you a taste of why i think it's amazing then listen to this song.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D4ytiqB6xlU\nThe music in every big Final Fantasy title always make the lore feel very alive and rich, this part of the series that we all know and love is fortunately carried through in this title and i'm sure you'll all enjoy it.\n\n-Game length. While i have 102 hours on my record i truly completed the game in 83 hours and the rest is where i left the game on and fell asleep but Final Fantasy only tracks time i've been actually playing. Final Fantasy is never usually a short game, especially because these titles are in development for many, many years. Don't worry about not thinking you might not get your money's worth out of this game because trust me, you will and there's still another 2 titles ahead of this that you have to play still.\n\n-For the overall goodside i'm still not sure on what makes me love this game even with all of it's flaws (which i state below). I think the character i love the most is Sazh, he's the one who seems like he's the only one who's slightly true to the objective of the game. Getting Dajh back as a father figure is his biggest drive, even though he doesn't seem very driven throughout most of the game because he proclaims himself as "old" and "tired/fed up". Like i said, this game gives a very love/hate relationship between itself and the player.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBad:\n\n-Snow Villiers.\n\n-A lot of the characters just moan throughout the game and a lot of the lines are pretty tacky/cheesy/cliche. Snow Villiers is the biggest example. Not only is he a cocky character but the majority of his lines are super far fetched about being a "hero" and if it's not that then he's always screaming and crying about Serah and holding that damn crystal tear. I also find Hope to be very annoying throughout the first half of the game, yes he lost his mother but he bottles his emotions towards Snow and starts to give of the vibe of an annoying little emo kid that only has character development because of a dead mother.\n\n-The last boss, Orphan. Not only do you fight barthandelus for the third time in the game but you then go on to fight Orphan straight after without any preperation and by then you might have used all of your TP to even have any left against Orphan. My biggest complaint about Orphan is the attack it uses and it's name ends in "Wrath". I can't express how ******* ANGRY that move makes me. That move has a chance, yes, A CHANCE, of instant killing either you, your party members or nobody at all. I want to put my keyboard through my ******* monitor when i'm close to killing Orphan and i get instantly killed by ******* CHANCE! To put the very final boss fight to rest in review, After you defeat the annoying Orphan you go on to fight Orphan's "final form" which is literally the easiest boss fight ever. Spam buffs and debuffs and Orphan II goes down in like 1-3 staggers.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nOverall:\n\nI do recommend this game a lot as it is one of my favorite Final Fantasy titles and because in the ending i felt nothing but relief and i cried tears of joy, but i do warn you of the bad things about this game, seriously.","January 3","true","108.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","50","1","2","0","0"

Once you realize how easy it is, you'll wonder why they even bothered pacing you.\n\nIt's a FF game catering to mainstream JRPG casuals, just like FFX did years before it... flash some graphical T & A and the bro's come a running. Then they claim to think they know stuff about RPG's and believe they're diverse because they're playing a game outside of their realm of EA sports titles... *sigh* whatever... let them have their piece of candy.\n\nThis game basically combines the story telling and gameplay progression elements of Final Fantasy IV and the graphical boner inducing glory that was FFX, put them both in a blender and yeah, you get this... a great looking FF game with autism.\n\nFor the first 25 hours or so you are introducted to our motley crew of characters, their backgrounds, obnoxious personalities and how to set the game on auto-battle and leave it there until you gain some kind of control over your party.\n\nThe game also introduces the crafting system, albiet a bit briefly and never really explains much other than telling you that you can upgrade your gear and dismantle it or sell it for gil... Bringing me to my next gripe, you never earn gil in this game, only components and computer parts that you can sell for gil... kind of ridiculous in a FF title, no? So needless to say this game is artificially extended by the GRIND. Seriously the game is only about 50 hours long but you'll be grinding materials for over 80+ hours if you expect to get everything in the game maxed out... be warned.\n\nThe game's maps consist of linear hallways for roughly 80% of the game with only a few area's giving you some room to explore. Nothing is really hidden either, there are literally zero secrets in this game, everything is incredibly obvious and in your face. The map never lies to you either, every area is mapped out properly so once you hit the edge of a map, that's it... there are no hidden path ways... It doesn't leave much to the imagination unfortunately but at least you know you're not going to need a guide book to hit 100% completion.\n\nFF13 sets out to tell a story, and that's exactly what it does, it's like the Metal Gear Solid 2 of Final Fantasy games... The game consists of very little game play and mostly cutscenes moving along the drama and unfolding the convoluted and confusing plot. At some point you'll just start disregarding everything everyone is saying so you can auto battle the next colossal, gorgeously rendered monster.\n\nIt's a great looking game, I'll give it that, it's just not a great Final Fantasy title... they stopped being great after FF6... it's just a sad fact. They all have way to many flaws in them to be considered great additions to the franchise and this is just another one added in to the mix of mixed bag RPG titles. Although I must admit, after playing FFXIII-2... it makes this game seem incredible in comparison.\n\nI recommend this game for someone looking for a story to just disappear in to for a few hours a day but as a gamer who enjoys to actually play their games and delve in to things rather than just run back and forth grinding out materials... I'd have to say meh.\n\nThankfully I've already beaten this game years ago and felt like experiencing it again, so I'm in a good mood... other wise I would of just trashed it but in retrospect the game does look beautiful... and I think that's what SquareEnix's original intensions were... to just show case how powerful the new generation of consoles could be.\n\nEither way, "bad ports" aside (what did you expect? I mean really?) It's like a 6.5/10 overall.","October 13, 2014","true","42.5"," 10 of 20 people (50%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","50","10","20","2","0"

Some people might dislike it,  cause it starts as a linear play-style like FF X but I would say , there is nothing bad about it. Story might look complicate it to you with weird words and stuff that happens in the game, but with flashbacks and in-game dialogs between protagonists you'll likely begin to understand whats happening and like the scenario.\nCombat is different, different then what I've seen before. Characters have different roles which you can swap during combat to heal, make your enemies vulnerable or to create tactics which suits you best. Character development is quite same as FF X, in which you use points that you gained combat to increase their base stats and make them learn new spells and techniques. While the stories moves on , you meet with your Espers, like Shiva and Odin but the with the name of Eidolon, which you can use in-combat also. I don't know why, but they can turn into motorbikes and horses and stuff , I don't know why, but hey it's Final Fantasy Right?! And, even if it's a port from PS3, I am playing and also recording the game with 60 fps. Splendid work from Square-Enix.\nWhat I don't like about the game, is mostly the male main characters and first chapter areas of the game. I don't like Sazh, Snow and dark & wasteland areas, which you encounter a lot during first 6 chapters. On the other hand, female characters are awesome, which I can say, is the best in all of FF series. ( even better than Tifa or Terra in my opinion ) They are tough, cold but strong and have their own dark/painfull past which makes them more interesting and wealthy.\nWith it's price, I asure you, you wont regret playing this game , but beware, 40gb's are gonna be downloaded first.\n\n10/10 will play again and make Lightning mai waifu.

For a game released in 2014, the visuals hold up very well against games in 2016.\n\nThe Crystarium levelling system, while also beautiful to look at, again feels linear. Another sucker punch to the hardcore Final Fantasy fans like myself, is the inability to power level. The Crystarium system locks to each section of the story and puts a halt to over levelling your party.\n\nI absolutely recommend FFXIII to hardcore Final Fantasy fans and users that are entirely new to the franchise.\nA fantastic game yes, but a fantastic Final Fantasy game?","May 19","true","23.8"," 5 of 10 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","5","10","0","0"

That being said, I played this game with an open mind and optimism.\n\nTo keep it short, the quantity of Pros I can list is more than the Cons, however the magnitude of those Cons I've seen puts my feelings towards it in a delicate balance.\n\nThe factors I believe favour this game are :\n+great soundtrack\n+memorable characters and their designs\n+battle system\n+difficulty\n+well written story\n+lovely visuals\n\nThat being said, the factors which oppose them are :\n-level caps\n-linearity\n-sudden spikes in difficulty curve\n\nBut the one that stood out to me the most was the glaring fact that everything which pieces the game together is more or less good except for the GAMEPLAY itself. The factors which were supposed to make this game good didn't mesh or merge together at all. Everything felt too disjointed, and this left me largely unsatisfied. I'm sure this game had a lot of potential on the drawing boards, even now I can see that it does, but they really sacrificed quality gameplay, possibly overthinking that the components were enough. That doesn't work in a JRPG. I do admit that I did feel a lot of love and immersion during the cut-scenes, however that did not make up for the entire thing.\n\nLooking at it now, the game in its rawest form is very good. If you're a fan of the series or a JRPG fan at heart I recommend it. Ibidem if you're an achievement hunter, though I do suggest possibly getting a trainer if you're in it just for the achievements, the game gets pretty hard and drawn out at its cusp. Highly recommend following a walkthrough either way.\n\nTo conclude, if you're familiar to RPG's and like how this game looks, or you bought it for cheap during Steam sales, give it a run through, you'll eventually at least want to continue on for the pretty stuff. However, if you're looking to get into JRPG's like Final Fantasy or never played a JRPG before, stay as FAR away from here as possible.\nWhile I don't like to work on a number or rating system, I'll simply say I'm neutral to this game; it's okay. Not bad or great, just good. 7/10 from me.","July 1, 2015","true","66.9"," 2 of 4 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","2","4","0","0"

It's a good experience as a first RPG, if you don't seek challenge or afraid to be lost on the map or on skill trees.\nGran Pulse is a lie, it should be renamed Grind Pulse, This game is closer to a Korean RPG than a Japanese.\nIf you didn't understand: FXIII is not a "RPG", its a grinding railroad visual novel.\n\nLong version, of facts that may you reconsider choice of buying the game:\nGame doesn't give you full control until Chapter 11 of 13, so after roughly 20 hour (easy 5 hours of videos and animations).\nStory is dull, even SpongeBob's life is more interesting.\nBattle Team of 3 max, on the 6 possible heroes.\nYou control only the leader, the AI controls the others depending on the current Parag~\nAuto-battle Option, because its better to let the IA choose the attacks instead of wasting time checking enemies weakness and select strategic skills.\nYou can't switch teams during the fight.\nIf the leader dies during a battle you lose, even though you have an healer that can rez him.\nEach hero can execute one Role at a time (Commando(Warrior), Ravager(Mago), Sentinel(Tank), Saboter(Debuff), Medic(Healer), Synergist(Buff))\nEach Roles has its own abilities, and they can't be shared. You have to switch Parag~ all the time.\nWhen you switch Parag~ every hero does an useless wasting time animation, while the enemies keep attacking.\nEvery Action sequence is directed to only 1 target, you can't heal several heroes one by one, or hit different enemies to disable them. So what's the game do? It split the sequence for each target,\nYou can only invoke the Summon of the leader.\nEach hero has only 1 summon (that you get after 20hours), so only 6 summons availables. That's poor.\nOnce summoned, the creature replaces the team and fight only with the leader, but its damages are weak on late game, so you don't use them.\nYou can't move your heroes during the fight. Result: Your tank aggro the enemies AOE just near the healer and the dps. You can lose or win a fight because of this.\nNo open-world: Gran Pulse is a joke and is the same as the common maps in Last Remnant.\nNo crafting\nEach weapons are the same, but the textures change.\nAttack animation are the same with every weapons.\nThere are archetypes of enemies, they are all the same, but the textures change.\nEnemies attacks animation are the same.\nVFX of magical attacks are simplistic, you don't feel any power from them.\nThere are tons a cinematic and animations sequence for nothing. They just break the rhythm (for as slow it is).\nSkills tree is a joke, i wonder why they didn't made an auto-level option, like the auto-battle option. Wasted my time waiting for useless animation of line filling up.\nSkills are the same for everyone, the only difference is the amount of xp to reach them.\nEach battle gives you a score with stars...  but no scoreboards or records of best fights exist.\nEnemies drops are bad, 2 max per enemies: 1 normal and 1 rare.\nBoss are HP bags, and not memorables...... i could go on but i won't.\nAnd if you still feel like playing this game because you never played FF, then don't because its not an FF.","December 26, 2014","false","30.6"," 54 of 109 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","54","109","0","6"

But again, just by lowering the shadows to 4K you will not get that problem at all (I tested walking through the same 5 locations with different options). Just by doing this you most likely will fix the problem.\n\nBottomline, I get 1080p/60fps with no other issues using AA x16 (even while recording at max settings with shadowplay) by using vSync and 2K instead of 8K. This doesn't change much what I said above, because despite this reduction from 8k to 2k the quality is very good at the end, and you still get the constant 60 fps with no stuttering at all.\n\nDuncan","December 11, 2014","true","13.3"," 33 of 67 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","33","67","0","1"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/shodacan/recommended/292120/","shodacan","Shodan","http://steamcommunity.com/id/shodacan/","246 products in account","I will start off by saying that I used to be a big fan of the FF series and Square's JRPGS of the 90's in general. After Squares PS1 era, I never had the chance or interest in playing any of the later installments in the FF series, mainly because I was exclusively a PC gamer. Then one day I notice to my surprise that they've released this on Steam, so I figured I'd go ahead and try the latest game in the series that I used to be such a big fan of in the past.\n\nAt first I have to comment on filesize of the game. When installed, the game takes 58 gb's of HDD which is insane!\nThe filesize is that big because the game includes both Japanese and English audio in the game and in the cutscene videos. It really would of been a nice if the original Japanese audio/video was an optional download. That way you would save up about 20gb worth of download time.\n\nNow for the actual game:\n\nGameplay:\nI found the gameplay incredibly boring and repetive. It doesn't have the ATB turn based combat of the previous installments, which I was aware of before I bought this game. Instead it has sort of real-time battle system where you only control one character. You can perform 3 moves in 1 turn and sort of chain different abilities and spells together. Or alternatively, you can just hit the auto-battle and it will automatically choose the best chains for you.\nSeriously, every battle is the same: Auto battle -> Auto battle -> Auto battle -> Heal -> Auto battle -> Auto battle -> Auto battle ->\n\nYou can unlock new abilities and attributes for your characters with the Paradigms. Basically, your characters have these roles you can choose for them which include offensive, defensive and healing roles. Each of these roles have their own "skill tree" which you can climb to unlock more abilities. The skill tree is as linear as it can get, so theres no actual options to choose from at all. You will simply unlock everything in one order over time. You can also change these roles in combat at anytime when you need to go from doing damage to healing. Its also good to point out that you can't change roles for individual characters in battle.\n\nThe game doesn't really have any actual RPG depth to it at all. Theres only 2 different stats (Strength and Magic) and only 2 different types of items that you can equip (Weapon and accessory). Can't get much more simplified than that.\n\nAs for the difficulty of the game. Theres two settings, easy and normal. I played the game on normal and thought it was incredibly easy. None of the boss battles gave me any challenge whatsoever (but then again, how could it with such a simplified gameplay mechanics). The game also recharges your health back to full everytime you win a abttle.\n\nGraphics:\nThe graphics are quite alright. The game is about 4-5 years old with initial release on 360 and PS3, so you can't realistically expect anything spectacular. Now that SquareEnix actually managed to get the game to run at 1080p, it looks even better. The game also runs at 60fps, but it has difficulties in maintaining it, so fps drops to 30 are pretty common. My GPU had max GPU usage of 10% when I played the game, so its simply bad optimisation.\n\nThe art design is where the game actually shines a bit. The characters are all well designed and look good. Most of the areas, landscapes, machines, bosses etc look great.\n\nControls:\nWith the game being a console port, you can expect some not-so-great controls on the keyboard. My biggest gripe was that Esc actually EXITED you out of the game without saving the game (Its now fixed and it asks you if you want to exit instead). I'm pretty sure that any PC gamer will automatically assume that Esc is the menu, not the god damn exit button.\nJust goes to show that the people at Square Enix who were reponsible for this port, had no idea how a game plays on a PC.\n\nMusic:\nThe music in this game sounds quite dull in general. Almost like elevator music, with the exception of few tracks in certain parts. They really need to hire Nobuo Uematsu again.\nAlso, theres no final fantasy fanfare. Thats equivalent of not having the blue policebox in doctor who!\n\nStory:\nI'm not gonna go into much detail about the story, but on a personal level, I found it to be quite uninteresting. For the first few hours of the game, I had no idea what the hell was going on at all. It starts you right in the middle of the action and doesn't explain much till later on. I can't comment on the entire story as I have yet to finish the game, but I'm about 12 hours in and it has pretty much failed to spark my interest yet.\n\nCharacters:\nI don't really know what to say about the characters in this game. Lightning was ok, though she sort of represented your very standard JRPG pragmatic soldier archetype. Sazh was a funny sidekick with his very handsome afro.\nVanille and Snow on the other hand made me want to hit the Esc button more than a few times.\n\nConclusion:\nThe game is INCREDIBLY simplified to the point where it felt like I was watching a mediocre visual novel, rather than playing a game. The game is very easy and offers little challenge. While the game has some redeeming qualities in certain areas, like in the visual design and certain aspects of the story, its not enough to make this game worthwhile at all when the only actual gameplay taking place in the game is you continuously pressing AUTO BATTLE and sometimes switching to heal mode when taking damage.","December 21, 2014","false","13.4"," 31 of 63 people (49%) found this review helpful","49","31","63","0","5"

If you want to know why, you can read more here.\n\n- My first impression about this game is the graphic. I played Final Fantasy XII in PS2, and I thought that the game had great scenery to offer. After I come here, I was really amazed. Such effects and realistic scenery that I think deserve high rating for this, I can say the development is much better.\n- The challenge. Although this game doesn't offer "full free roam" feature like FF XII, exploring the area of each chapter is still giving interests. Sorry to say, that compared to FF XII, this version is much easier to complete. I really miss the time when I needed to defeat Yiazmat in 4 hours :(\n- The storyline. It seems that Square Enix did well enough to give the players "feel trip". Hard times, good times, all of them are expressed well. I give 8/10 for the storyline.\n- The last, but not least, the EPIC BGM. It seems that Final Fantasy Series offer beautiful soundtrack, and always related to the atmosphere the player in. I really like the final boss BGM, giving enough thrill to defeat him (lol)\n\nI don't regret buying this game for spending my holiday. Probably going to buy Final Fantasy XII-2 for Summer Holiday.","December 26, 2014","true","95.2"," 15 of 31 people (48%) found this review helpful","48","15","31","0","0"

This game is simply amazing. It was great on the consoles and it's even better on PC. Why is it better here? Because we can mod it! I can't speak for how far the modding community will go, but by god it looks good with the mods.

(legit crap though...see later)  I enjoy this game a lot.  Once you get past the first few areas, the combat picks up a lot and you really start to get a feel for the flawed characters, how they mesh together...or not, at times.  Back to the combat though.  Yes you control 1 character, and yes if s/he gets down'ed it's game over, but that adds to the sense of urgency in some battles that you need to control the game very carefully.  Yes there's that silly auto-battle function, but you literally will not have fun with this game at all if you just rely on that.  Paradigm shifting and having good setups is essential to winning mid-late game fights.\n\nYes the "exploration" is quite linear, but once you realize that, it makes you want to see every nook, cranny, horizon, etc. for what it is.  And some places are just plain gorgeous, nearly on par with top level pc games.  Also that linear'ness means you can't go back to any areas at all, on Cocoon at least, so find every treasure chest/orb you can.  But yeah this is a beautiful game and stop and smell the roses sometimes.\n\nThe story?  People say it's confusing or convoluted or whatnot.  ...I found it fairly simple.  You just have to pay attention to what's happening, read the bits of dialogue presented to you, don't skip the cutscenes. (lol telling this generation of gamers that is folly, i know).  Don't let your ideas of a "perfect story" cloud what's going on.  Listen to the character's plight, how they interact with each other and the world around them.  Let the characters grow on you.  ...Yes even Vanille, though if you use her in the party after a certain point, try to keep the volume down.  Otherwise it'll sound like you're watching an adult film.  Not sure what her voice actress was thinking in that regard.\n\nYou don't "level up" in a traditional sense.  You gain points every battle you use to advance on the crystarium and increase the power of your roles and characters.  The crystarium itself levels up though almost every time you face a major boss.  The enemies do respawn in some areas, so grinding is possible.  though early in the game if you want to grind you have to save/quit/load.  Your weapons and accessories gain experience through using items gained by defeating enemies or buying at the conveniently placed shop consoles.  (there are no "town hubs" to go to like other Final Fantasy games)  Also your HP is restored after every battle.\n\nThe visuals, sound effects and music/soundtrack?  All excellent.  Areas that Square/Square-Enix never fail to deliver.\n\nIn short, i'm only halfway through the game, and I enjoy the crap out of it.  Final Fantasy 13 has a reputation for being a polarizing entry in the series.  People love it, or they hate it.  ...I'm on the side of the fence that loves it for what it is.  A charming adventure with a cast of quirky characters in a desperate situation trying to survive and get to know each other and grow as people.  ...Who happen to have super powers.\n\nMy only gripes with this game are the quality of the port.  No grapics options?  Locked to 1 resolution?  Alt-tabbing breaks some of the visual functionality and sometimes crashes the game.  I wish i could go back to visit areas.  Vanille's battle sounds reminding me of "adult content".  The lack of being able to get gil without farming specific enemies in specific areas for sellable items.  ...The lack of use for gil until the endgame.  The game does lose framerate in high stress/action areas, even though my pc blows a PS4's specs out of the water. (this is a playstation 3 game, so...).\n\nRight though.  Give the game a chance.  You'll either kick yourself for not playing this fantastic game sooner, or you'll hate it.  It's fairly cheap as well, so, yeah.","October 14, 2014","true","94.7"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

The most frustrating thing about it is, all of the necessary parts to have made a very passable and enjoyable Final Fantasy game are here, but any gems were sunk deep into an ocean of bad design decisions and poor storytelling.  The gameplay is a complete mess driven primarily by random luck and twitch reflexes, and the game primarily plays itself.  Battles are needlessly and frustratingly long, and because the vast majority of control and configuration are taken OUT of your hands, you don't even feel like victories are the result of your actions.  Yes, Final Fantasy games have always had battle systems where you did the same thing over and over again and very rarely needed to change your strategy up, but once you've removed even THAT gameplay, you're left with nothing.  But in "streamlining" away the actual gameplay, Square-Enix didn't bother to REDUCE the amount of it.  In fact, they doubled down on making all of the post-game content entirely combat based.  Well, scratch that... half combat, half WALKING.  Out of my 40+ hour save file, easily 5 hours was spent watching Lightning's butt run across meadows.  And none of that was "exploration", it was needless backtracking.  There's a point in the game where there's a circle of stones that give you quests.  It is a 3 minute run across an open field away from the closest fast travel point, every single one of the missions it gives you is a 20 minute run away (or 6-8 minutes with fast travel you need to run ALL the way back to), and you can only accept one of the missions at at time, and they HAVE to be set from the stones.  They'll get added to your list of missions alright, but if you want to change your active one, you have to WALK to the stone you got it from.  This game has more senseless padding than a dozen freshman term papers.  If they'd pared down the crappy gameplay and tightened this to a 20-30 hour experience, spread out the exploration instead of trying to cram an unimpressive Monster Hunter clone into the middle, and fleshed out the story and characterization more with writers instead of character designers, they could've had something to be proud of.   Instead it's an incoherent padded mess that just frustrates you with squandered potential.","April 22","false","43.4"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

PROs and CONs first. Then some comments I have about the game.\n\nPROs:+Story presentation\n+Characters and development\n+Scenery / environment\n+Some nice architecture\n+Variety of enemies & bosses\n\nCONs:-Boring\n-Annoying item crafting / upgrading system (grindfest)\n-Linear (not really important though)\n-Uninteresting gameplay\n-Seriously... very boring gameplay.\n\nComments:\nI played this game total of 16.5 hours or so. And first hour was somewhat interesting. Then it just became such a drag to play and was just painfully boring. Gameplay became such a drag that I even lost interest in cutscenes / story... because gameplay just utterly killed the mood to bother with anything. Gameplay in a nutshell is just run around, encounter enemy, spam A.. sometimes press R1 ...then sit in cutscene for 10min  and so on. It's just is not interesting at all.\n\nEven when game sessions / sittings where I felt "I played this game quite a lot today. Prolly like 2-3 hours has passed" then I look at the clock and only ~50min had passed.\n\nBut I paid money for this game and constantly forced myself to "finish" it... at some point (6-8) hours into game? I just got so fed of it and figured to make it a bit more entertaining for myself by simply maxing my money (cheat it in) so I could upgrade my weapons and stuff. And thus it helped to play another 8 hours.\n\nBut no... I'm done with this game. It's probably the most boring game I have ever played in my life. The gameplay.. is just painful... its a drag...\n\nSometimes it became so boring that instead of feeling sleepy or yawning.. it just ♥♥♥♥♥♥ me off.\n\nFF XIII-2 Is supposedly more fun to play. So I will check it out.. but I'm expecting same boredom.\n\nIf you want to know story or so... just go watch "cutscene movie" on youtube or something.\n\nScore: 4/10","May 11","false","16.6"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeliveryGodNoah/recommended/292120/","DeliveryGodNoah","DeliveryGodNoah","http://steamcommunity.com/id/DeliveryGodNoah/","363 products in account","Final Fantasy has certainly changed, for better or worse. In some respects, it's certainly obvious that the changes made were to make the game appeal to a large audience, simplifying some of the mechanics people have come to love to make it more approachable. FFXIII is a victim of this.\n\nWhile 13 does have a bit of RPG depth, it's mostly shallow and a bit false. To start off, the "leveling" system is pretty linear. In fact it's mostly linear. You have multiple different character "classes" to level up, but each one is just a stream of single graphs that only really go forward. There are a couple random branches, but you might as well fill all them up with the experience you gain from one battle anyway, so there's absolutely no reason to skip them. It's almost like they wanted to go for a Sphere Grid like system from Final Fantasy 10, but decided for the sake of simplicity to just make it a single line. The only real effect you have on the leveling is which class you want to level up first and when.\n\nThe most character building depth comes from the weapon customization, but even that is almost too straight forward. You gain several little useless bits and pieces of monsters and electronics after each battle, which you can either just sell, or use to craft weapon upgrades. It's not as exciting as it sounds though. You choose one weapon to upgrade, and then choose from ANY of the components you've acquired. The only difference is the amount of experience it puts towards your weapon upgrade. Eventually you'll meet the number on the screen, and your weapon or armour's stats boost up a bit.\n\nI can also see what they were TRYING to do with the combat, but it still falls victim to it being too simple. You've probably heard that the game plays itself. Well, early on in the game, it actually kind of does. The game chooses the "best" combination of attacks toward and enemy, and then executes them without you having to touch anything. You CAN choose exactly which skills to use and in what order, but since the Auto-command chooses the best set anyway, you'll end up using the exact same thing. There is a bit of strategy with the Paradigm system, which basically changes the class of your characters in battle to different jobs such as switching from melee attacks to magic, or from magic to healing, but that doesn't come into play until a couple hours in.\n\nBut really, I came for the story to be honest. Final Fantasy games have always had very interesting stories in my eyes, even if they are sometimes predictable. The story in this game isn't...terrible, but I feel like they wasted a bit of potential. Character progression is okay, even if it does sometimes go to that cheesy, over-dramatic line. Part of the problem is, the game is so linear you only feel like an onlooker rather than part of the story, so often it's hard to become completely invested in what happens. Overall though, it's not bad. Voice acting ranges from almost bad, to pretty admirable.\n\nNow what about the PC port. In one word, pathetic. In more words, at least they tried...later on.\n\nAt first the port of a sad excuse and laughable. No PC options, abysmal framerates, and forced 720p resolutions. It's the whole reason I held off buying this game on PC.\n\nThen they decided to wait until they released the second FFXIII game on PC to patch the first game. And then they have the audacity to claim that they are features. 60FPS and 1080p are not features on the PC platform. They are what many consider to be the absolute standard.\nBut good luck keeping the game at 60FPS. While there are a couple PC graphic options, it's still pretty hilarious how little there are. You get a resolution option, an AA option, and shadow resolution. That's really it. Outside of combat, my FPS ranges from 30-60 all over the place, causing pretty bad stuttering when doing so. It's never consistent. In combat my FPS tends to stay at 60, but does drop when there are a lot of enemies.\n(780ti OC\nAMD 8350 OC\n16GB 2300Mhz RAM)\n\nDespite all this, do I enjoy this game at all? Yes. Even with all it's simplified mechanics and poor porting, the game has gorgeous vistas, a great soundtrack, a decent story, and the combat can occasionally be exciting and even challenging. It's also not terribly priced. It should be less due to the awful port issues, but at least they aren't trying to get $30-$50 out of us.","December 19, 2014","true","13.3"," 7 of 15 people (47%) found this review helpful","47","7","15","0","0"

This game in much more linear than most of other FF in the game series and the first installment n the series of FF XIII has a slow start, but later on the game becomes really fun. I totally support this game, specially if this mean square enix will bring other RPGs to PC.\n\nI have read so many complains about the graphics or the escape issue but really, is nothing that big.

And also, the keyboard gets locked very often, usually with anything related to the ESC key. Imagine wanting to get out and the damn thing doesn't let you. It's more than annoying. Plus, when the ESC key works 'fine', it doesn't even ask you if you want to quit, it just quits without warning. A lot of issues.\n\nThat said, the game itself is pretty good, I enjoy it. Sadly all these issues let me no option than to not recommend to buy this. At the very least until Square-Enix even dares to apologize or even release some statement regarding this. They're acting like the game is fine and as if we all are happy. Awful behavior for what it calls itself a serious company.

Sure, the technical side of things don't look so good yet, what with the frame rate problems many are having, along with the 720p lock etc, I still am having a good time on this game.\n\nWith maximize performance and v-sync along with triple  buffering, this game has become very much playable (not a constant 60 fps ofc..) and very enjoyable. The visuals are extremely appealing, the story is easy to follow for those who pay attention and it's rather immersive too. I definitely enjoy the casts very much, as they each portray significant character progressions and developments, which in my honest opinion, is what makes a bunch of good characters.\n\nDefinitely an enjoyable time so far, despite only playing for a little, and definitely looking forward to playing this game for the next couple of hundred hours (replay and all that, since I like it).

After playing about 15 hours I am disappointed.\n\nBeginning with the positive Points:\n- I like the graphical style, it looks quite nice\n- the story seems to be engaging\n\nNow to the more negative points\n- The Port is locked to 720p, which is unacceptable, not even because I am a graphics-fetishist (as seen in the positives), but because it messes up my Second Screen, which I use to watch Stuff while playing (I know, you should concentrate on the game, but that way I get bored).\n-not a big point, but I would like buttons on screen to reflect if I'm using Keyboard or Gamepad, but the controls are easy enough, so that's not a big deal\n- at first, the level-up system (crystals) seems to give you more choices as to how to develop your Characters, or have a more direct control over it like in ff7 and 8, but when you start backpaddling to grind a little more points you'll soon be at the point, where you just developed everything, so there's no real choice.\n-right now I have 4 Characters, maybe there'll be more, but it doesn't feel like these are enough. Also, I had at no point a choice which Characters I'll pack, maybe that'll change.\n-leveling up weapons is as boring as can get. In FF7 you had to find or buy them, maybe do a quest or something. in FF 8 you had to find a magazine and some materials, to build them (quite similar with limit breaks), in 13 you (as far as I see it) have no limitbreaks whatsover, you find weapons somewhere in the level or just buy them at the next save point. Also every weapon can be levelled up, but you don't need specific items. You just use whatever you have, because non-usable items just give you points, and leveling up the weapon needs X points. So you don't need to search for thos items, just grind until you have enough.\n\nbut the 2 big points that just puts me off:\n-Every level is linear. No maze, no puzzle, nothing. For now I haven't even seen some kind of world map. I don't have a real option where to go except for like 10 meters left or right, where there's usually a box with a little item. Not hidden or anything, just in a little appendage of the original path. If I wanted to watch a movie, I'd watch a movie.\n-The fights. I kind of miss random fights, especially when I try to develop my characters and don't want to run for through the whole level again and again, because fights are kind of sparce, but that I can look over. Most of the fights are just to easy. You have an all offensive paradigm at start, and your Characters will get rid of every opposing force in 30 seconds (sometimes less than 10). But there are some bigger fights, that just go on and on. for the most part, it doesn't seem to make much sense to actually compose your attacks manually, because the automatic choses well enough, so except for some usage of items, you choose your paradigm (depending on situation) press "A" repeatedly until the situation changes or the fight is over. That's not very engaging, to be fair.","October 19, 2014","false","15.0"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful","45","5","11","0","0"

My impressions of the game itself are mixed but positive. Character development is phenomenal and the story is engaging. I would have been happy watching the first 10 chapters (instead of playing them). The paradigm system relies significantly on switching AI profiles to manage combat. While it takes away some strategy, combat is nevertheless fast-paced and engaging.\n\n\nThe few low points are the extreme linearity of most of the story, slow then sudden character progression, and upgrade system. For much of the game you literally walk characters down hallways. Then, quite suddently, you are thrust into an expansive overworld! Character progression is slow and boring, but eases you into many of the non-obvious game mechanics. Upgrading weapons and accessories is pointless through most of the game, then only crucial post-game (apparently...).\n\nThe Port\nHere is why I would never recommend this game: the port is terrible. I've stuggled through 30 hours of gameplay and have can no longer tolerate the laggy and stuttering graphics. My computer exceeds the recommend requirements (AMD Phenom X4 965 and AMD Radeon 6850) but still struggles to plan the game at 720p.

But hey a 2~3rd year Computer Science major could write a decent configuration why couldn't Square Enix do it?\n\nThat said it's a beautiful Final Fantasy game. For PC. For $15.

In my opinion, Final Fantasy XIII is an incredibly amazing game. From the storyline to the dynamic characters, from the picturesque settings to the beautifully orchestrated music, this game is an easy favorite for me. As a fan of RPGs, I've never really tried a "JRPG" before, but Final Fantasy XIII has shown me a new sub-genre of gaming to love.\n\nDownside(s)\n\nOnly one thing I found that slightly irked me about the game is the post-game or end-game Gil (the in-game currency) and item farming to get the coveted 100% completion. It can become mundane, but I've been able to push myself through. Another common complaint I've seen online is people are upset this PC remake of the PS3/XBOX 360 doesn't use 1080p but 720p for the graphics. Personally, I don't find it a concern big enough to not buy the game. Could it look more polished up, sure, but what couldn't? It still plays well and looks stunning.\n\nGood Bits\n\nOne of my favorite things about this game is the fact that it's incredibly easy to get the hang of battling monster (which is the main game-play mechanic). As you progress, combating enemies goes from something easy-breezy to moderately challenging to downright complex. The game does an incredible job though of introducing each new character, skill, ability, and game-play mechanic in a timely fashion which makes it easy to adapt to. Some battles will literally last you six seconds while others can have a "target time" of 30 or more.\n\nThe characters are another thing I fell in love with for this game. The cutscenes that develop the plot further with well-spoken dialogue and an amazing array of people. Along the journey of Final Fantasy XIII you'll meet people ranging from the stoic "Lightning" Farron to the overly optimistic Oerba dia Vanille. It's an incredible array or personalities that collide due to fate, and how they interact is beautifully done.\n\nIn summary, Final Fantasy XIII is a wonderful game. It offers a challenging game-play with easy-to-use controls, scenic locations, all wrapped up with an amazing storyline.","October 14, 2014","true","193.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

Tetsuya Nomura punya woo..\n-japanese audio.\n-high fps. no frame skip.\n-fast load\n-interesting myths and storyline.\n-menus are easy to be navigate.\n-CP for upgrading skills is not distributed between characters.\n-characters' health is fully restored after each battle.\n-enjoying the game so far. hope will not get bored later.\n\nCons:\n-Confusing plot. need to read a lot about it in menus. so chill.\n-no native graphic options. means that u can play with preset graphic. cant get ultra setting.-.- but the environment looks great already.\n-control only one character as a leader in battle. if he/she is dead, game over. sucks when 5 enemies are targeting the leader.\n-battle system is not so creative. people will mash on auto-battle a lot. i wish it would be more tactical.\n-exploration seems easier than previous FF. need more adventure >.<\n\nJadi, sapa2 yang minat game FF tu bole la try main kat Steam.","October 21, 2014","true","44.1"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","0"

People complain about the linearity of FFXIII but I put it to them that most of the FF games are just as linear and that works just fine for them.\n\nIf you like Final Fantasy games, you'll like this one. If you're getting in to them, I'd start at something like 10 instead (maybe the HD port will come to Steam one day!). If you don't like them, well, why are you reading this review, this game is obviously not for you. :P\n\nThe scenery is beautiful, the gameplay is fun - even on easy bosses can be quite a challenge so make sure you have the right paradigms set up so you can switch to either aggression or healing whenever you need. Vanille's voice slips all over the world in terms of accent but as a bright and cheerful character she's a ray of light in the first 15 or so hours of the game.\n\nI'm about 17 hours in to the game at time of writing and I've only just been given the ability to change my party members - since it apparently takes that long to get the party together and for most of the game you're jumping between pre-determined groups. Which is fine for plot reasons though it is really nice to actually have a say in who I'm playing as. Not expecting too much from the plot, it's certainly not 13's most redeeming quality. But it's a fun game - especially if you just want to relax - I find this is the game I turn to when I want to mostly switch my brain off. Which isn't a criticism - it's good to relax with video games and the gorgeous scenery and indeed the game's contentious linearity are absolutely perfect for that.","October 16, 2014","true","40.2"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","44","4","9","0","0"

I played 45 hrs before I realised that the gameplay was unlikely to open up enough to make up for the time spent on it. I stopped playing it for several reasons:\n\n1: This game runs like a turd, with an fps that goes up and down with more vigor than your favourite pornstar, terrible issues with stuttering ( it seems to be the in thing these days ) and very few settings to change.\n\n2: The linear maps. I went through chapter after chapter in a straight line. No joke. There was a few obstacles to "auto-leap" over. Seriously? Most likely you will keep moving forward, come accross a very obvious floating orb, you cant miss it, open it to find loot, move forward and face an ememy and do it again.\n\n3. No side quests, no dungeons to get lost in, little to no customization, a level up system that is a straight line and the most challenging puzzle I played ammounted to turning 4 switches on which were only guarded by enemies that I had been defeating for the last 4 hrs - that's it. There is some upgrading to weapons and accessories, but it's overly complicated and not worth the hassle. You discover weird things like a microchip, electronic this and that but what it boils down to in the end is converting it to exp to level up your weapon in microscopic ammounts. I did this for a while only to find a better weapon in those very easy to access orbs. And by the way, the orbs are the only thing that have loot besides enemies.\n\nThat being said the game does have some positives. Despite the issues, the game is very pretty and the cut scenes are epic. The story line is pretty epic, though I didn't want to finish it because the gameplay ruined that aspect. I think the only reason I put up with this game for so many hours was because of the interesting story line. I think I might just watch all the cutscenes on youtube or something.\n\nThe combat system is moderately fun, and there is an element of trying to figure out what moves work and don't, and learning to chain with paradigm shifts is somewhat satisfying. Unfortunately, it's all you do... all the time.\n\nI have never really played Final Fantasy before, so unfortunately, this seems like a bad place to start. I'm not sure I can handle the graphics of Final Fantasy 7. So I guess I'll wait till 15 comes out.\n\n4/10 - + Great story, awesome cutscenes\n- Performance issues, linear gameplay, a combat system that grows boring, no japanese?!.","April 23","false","49.0"," 4 of 9 people (44%) found this review helpful","44","4","9","0","1"

The design and atmosphere of both shining utopian world of Cocoon and wild, dangerous and abandoned Gran Pulse is just so original, you will never know where to look first. Although the visual side of the game was apparently top priority for developers, all of the other aspects are not so bad as people like to claim. All of the characters have their own motivations and troubles, and even though i didn't enjoy unfolding their stories as much as i did in Final Fantasy VII, or Final Fantasy IX, it was in no way boring.\n\nFrom very start of the game, you must forget about how our world works and patiently absorb the atmosphere and working of Fabula Nova Crystalis universe. There is no explanatory intro and you are thrown into conflict between two sides you don't know, in place you don't recognize on a planet which is apparently freaking inverted (reminded me of standing on the inside of Halo ring). It comes slowly and I spent a LOT of time browsing through "datalog" (kind of in-game encyclopedia and journal) so the mild feeling of confusion is something you should expect from the beginning. I personally enjoyed the slow exploration of this strange sci-fi, fantasy, mythical world however.\n\nThe combat in XIII is an interesting mix of direct action (your character) and indirect role selecting (two other characters in your party) which makes for a lot of ways to play. Just look at youtube and you will find that everyone uses quite different team compositions. Generally the combat is fast, stylish and definitely feels like Final Fantasy type, although you won't feel so much of control over the exact actions of characters, as you did in past games. Too bad the character development is kind of straightforward one (at least until over half of the game) and sometimes i felt like a machine putting experience points ("Crystogen Points" or "CP" in-game) into the skills and attributes chained one after another with a little choice which one to prefer of leave behind. For example, for a mage caracter Hope, even if you want to max preferably "magic" attribute, you sometimes have to "waste" a lot of CP into strength attribute, even when you know you won't use it, just to get to those "magic" ones.\n\nI finished the game recently and the beautiful EPIC finale left me with no doubts about quality of this game however. Even though its sometimes more of a movie, than a game, its still a must for every fan of series and I would recommend it to every other player, who likes rpgs with strong story, fast action and japanese sci-fi world filled with strange but beautiful magic and myths.\n\nI personally had no trouble with graphics or other port issues as some people mentioned.","December 20, 2014","true","59.0"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I was excited to see it released on steam and I bought it on sale.  I can't get the game to open and play it.  I can't get past the launcher.  It seems I am not the only one with this problem, the forums are full of FFXIII "Crash Club" members.  I am very dissapointed.  Until this issue is addressed I don't recomend buying it.","December 31, 2014","false","17.8"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

The story was one of the best stories I have ever played in my life, One of the main reasons I regretted trading my 360 in was that I couldn't finish this triliogy, but now I have the chance to be able to play all three games again on steam. I strongley recommend this game and part 2 if you are looking for a good story to play.","November 16, 2014","true","6.5"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Why all the combat consists of only three (3) options, namely strike, heal and strike twice? Is this some kind of joke? Why there are no items and stats? Why enemies are not giving you nether exp no money?\n\nWhy Hope's mother says "Moms are tough" three times in a row? Are we 8 year old?\nIGN, I'm looking to you, you gave this game 8.9 and at the same time criticize Life is Strange for bad writing.\n\nOr that guy is complayning that his gun is heavy and he is YAWNING? While people are dying around him?\nVanille, you are standing in a pile of bloody corpses and you are LAUGHING? Seriously? People are ♥♥♥♥ing dying around of you, and you finding this fun?\n\nWhat the ♥♥♥♥ is this? How can we feel even some degree of emotion toward a characters who look like a bunch of cosplayers playing paitball and speeking in generic cliche phrases?\n\nWhat the heck is going on with the game, why so many posititve reviews? Has the world went mad? I may understand that some people never played a single FF game so they don't have a perspective, but that game is plainly bad, broken, and absolutely unredeemable from any point of view. I dont even know.","August 7, 2015","false","1.6"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

I've played the game partway through Chapter 2, and had low expectations.\n\nThis game is... Not as bad as people make it out to be. The music is godly thanks to Uematsu, the combat mechanics are solid, and the story... Well, that's my one problem so far. It's a case of "let's use all these phrases, then only explain them once they're right in front of our faces," rather than previous FFs where you hear rumors and such, explaining what things are. Oh, and Hope is the most punchable character in writing.","January 2, 2015","true","7.1"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"
