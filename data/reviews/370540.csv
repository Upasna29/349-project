It's not World of Tanks. It's not Panzer General.\n\nThis is massive. It's a simulation of the largest ground conflict in history. It models weather, ammunition, supply, logistics, partisans, air warfare, and of course combat. But because it's massive it can be daunting.\n\nWith all of that details come the challenge. At times it can be difficult to know if you're making the right choice. The interface can, at times, be overwhelming. All of the sudden a unit is highlighted in red. Why? It's not always evident immediately what is happening, or if it's significant. (Red highlight means it's out of supply range)\\n\nI'd recomend starting with the 3 turn Scenario Road to Minsk. It's a quick fix, shows you the basics, but also is complex enough to offer a lot of replayability. With some of the longer scenarios it's easy to get lost and just see a wave of units. With the Minsk scenario you have a difficult objective. Not because the battles are hard, but because you must grab massive quantities of territory on top of conquering the enemy. For an added challenge, try the Soviet side. The game tacticvs change completely.\n\nWhich brings me to the full campaign. The monster that is Barbarossa. For myself it's too big. It's a massive theatre of war that quite frankly is daunting. Check out Grey Hunters Let's Play for a truly epic story.\n\nI'd love to see more scenarious I can tackle in an evening. I'd love to see tooltips to tell me exactly why that unit is highlighted yellow. Or why that attack failed.\n\nThrough all of the detail and interface is an entertaining game. The first time you play just click and go. Then learn to encircle, learn to use multiple hexes (hint, select one hex to attack, then hover your mouse over the neighbors), then start longer games.\n\nWar in the East is difficult, no doubt about it, but it's also an entertaining simulation.","July 9, 2015","true","92.4"," 104 of 120 people (87%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","87","104","120","4","8"

BitD is actually 1973 with the release of a paper hex map / cardboard counter game by the name of Drang Nach Osten. The map was about 4' x 5', the counters totaled over 1,500 individual pieces. Add the expansion Unentschieden! (yes, they invented what would become DLC BitD), and the maps got bigger, with thousands more counters. It took hours just to set up, before ever actually playing. And the play... we met every Saturday night for about a year, and only got into 1943 before marriage, college, the military and various nervous disorders most often resemblng German and Russian language Tourette Syndrome broke up the group and brought the endevour to an end.\n\nAll of which is only backstory to my purchase of War in the East - technology has granted us the ability to actually play the beast that is The Great Patriotic War at the operational level without renting a hall and losing our minds. It's been done a number of times in recent decades, but Gary Grigsby has done it the best, by a wide margin. If you've read this far and have any idea what I'm talking about. AND are interested in the subject, then buy this game. I'd forgotten how good it is (getting it on Steam has reintroduced me and taken me away from other CCG and FPS for the past weeks), and how easy it is to immerse oneself in it. But back in the saddle it's the only thing I'll be doing for a while.\n\nLike: It's the @#$%&*! East Front done right, for Zhukov's sake!\n\nDislike: It's 01:43 after a full work day, again, and I'm too tired to keep playing.","September 12, 2015","true","227.8"," 75 of 81 people (93%) found this review helpful 24 people found this review funny","93","75","81","24","1"

Not to mention the unending amount of bookkeeping involved. If you want to simulate manpower, replacement rates, supply etc., and you DO if you want any sort of realism in a wargame, you're going to have bookkeeping. Computers do all of that PLUS you don't have to have a spare garage to keep those giant maps and thousands of counters lying around for months while you play it. IF you can find somebody to play it WITH.\n\nNow, back to this game. Old grognards like myself will remember cardboard titles like Drang Nach Osten/Unentschieden (Fire in the East/Scorched Earth) and Gary Grigsby's War in the East IS those games, only even better as you now have a computer capable of simulating everything down to the amount of ammo available for Mauser 98k rifles available to every single unit in the game. All behind the scenes so you don't have to bother if you don't want to. But you can, and if you ever want to know how many PzIVs you made this months, you can get that info too. Or not. You don't have to.\n\nIf you just want to push counters and conquer hexes, you can do that too, leaving almost everything else to the AI, which is very good at what it does. And that's the true beauty of this title, in my opinion. If you're just starting out and are a bit intimidated by the sheer size of this monster, and you have every reason to be, then don't worry. Just play. Select unit, move, attack, move some more, and let the computer handle the rest. Very intuitive and easy to get into.\n\nIf you want more, and eventually you will, then there's the extensive manual (almost 400 pages) that covers everything you might want to know. And so gradually you learn more and more about how your supplies work, how air power works, how to keep your units in supply, how to keep the enemy OUT of supply etc., all without having to learn it before moving a single counter. Too many games demand that you memorize the manual before you can even be moderately successful at playing the game, much less have any actual fun doing so. WitE is not one of those games, which is really impressive considering the amount of information and detail involved.\n\nHistorical? If you want something closer to history than this game, you'll probably have to invent a time machine and start learning how to speak German. The early lightning advances, watching your precious Panzers becoming shadows of their former selves as they race out of range of their own supplies as their supporting infantry struggles to keep up, watching everything come to a standstill as General Mud bogs down everything, grand encirclements, spending weeks reducing pockets of enemy troops cut off knowing that your infantry really needs to get the job done and get to the front before the Russians can start counterattacking your vulnerable flanks, you name it. WitE has it.\n\nThe price tag? Yes, it is expensive, but you'll be playing this game for years and years if wargaming is your thing, so you'll get your money back. If you're not sure if you'll ever like actual simulations of operational warfare as opposed to the beer and pretzels variety with pretty 3D icons, you should probably start off with something smaller, but if you're already interested in turn based wargames and the war on the Eastern Front, this is the game you absolutely have to have.","July 22, 2015","true","140.1"," 68 of 75 people (91%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","91","68","75","3","1"

This game rewards the knowledge you gain from each turn, and you start feeling like those Kraut armies of yours are all your own well disciplined children that are ready to wreak sytematic havoc and destruction on the Russians ahead.  You will feel proud of them as they attack fearlessly, with you knowing Hitler's meddling won't do them in this time.  You are going to show the world what a well organized modern army can do to it's enemies.  (at least this is how I felt after getting comfortable with my personal Russian whoop-♥♥♥ mechanism).\n\nForget Road to Minks, just start with the 224 turn 41-45 Barbarossa map and start going balls deep into Russia.\nYou will be thinking what a bunch of German generals thought in the first few weeks, Moscow by Labor Day perhaps.\nLittle by little your respect grows for the enormity of this map, the challenges of supply, an enemy driven by the whims of a brutal dictator, and the wonders of finding yourself balls deep in a vast and mysterious Soviet landscape.  Just start over each time you learn something awesome so by the 3rd or 4th Barbarossa you are feeling much more confident with your boys because you have the needed "trigger time" from 20 or so hours of gameplay.  I like a game where I can say, "ok ♥♥♥♥♥es, hit me with your best shot, let's see what you got!" and still have fun if you fail to get an objective you set for yourself.  After 70ish hours of gameplay, the closest I have been to Moscow is within 15 hexes, and love how the game challenges me to capture that rathole at any cost.\n\nPOSITIVES:  I love the actual numbers of soldiers, etc, I love how the armees are set up for complete freedom of movement, I love I finally found a game that does THE ENTIRE EASTERN FRONT. Thank you Gary Grigsby, your photo is getting framed and going up next to Wagner and Nietzsche on the mantle.\n\nNEGATIVES:  Jeez, we are going to need a powerful microscope to find some dirt here, let me think....ok...there are no naked chicks in this game.  After 70+ hours of gameplay, nothing significant is coming to mind.  It appears pretty polished at this point.

Many may remember Avalon Hill's classic "Russian Campaign."   The manual is an impressive 377 A4 pages.  Despite this, the game can be played with remarkably little knowledge.  So while the learning curve is long, at the introductory level it is not steep.  After the initial interest of movement and combat you will soon find yourself persusing the manual to find out the finer detail and how to get an advantage on your opponent.   There are, thankfully, no boom/flash graphics.  A well laid out "board" with enough graphical detail to give information without being over the top.  Standard wargaming counters give it that classic boardgame feel.  Multiplayer is well catered for with the Matrix server providing the interaction between players.\nSo if you like classic wargaming, and part of the fun is reading through the manual, GG WiTE could be a good title to add to your collection.","September 2, 2015","true","68.7"," 19 of 22 people (86%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","86","19","22","0","0"

The price should be enough to scare away anyone from making an impulse purchase they will regret. That said, if you are looking for an incredibly detailed depiction of the Eastern Front in WW2, look no further.\n\nIf you don't want to tackle the whole enchilada, you can have plenty of fun playing the smaller scenarios depicting the individual Army Groups during Barbarossa, or other scenarios covering events later in the war. This is where I've spent all of my time and I have enjoyed it. One day I will take on the full campaign, but not yet.\n\nMy biggest personal surprise when I started playing the game was just how easy it is to pick up the basic controls.

Of course, there's a ton more to the game than that, but it's great that you can hop right in and get to the action.\n\nI wouldn't jump in blindly, given the price tag, but if you are interested in the setting or just a lover of strategy, you can't go wrong with GG's War in the East.\n\nNote: I played the game a lot before it was available on Steam, which my play time here doesn't reflect.","July 13, 2015","true","7.7"," 21 of 28 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","21","28","0","0"

That's a period from 1941 to 1945 with numerous scenarios covering a number of campaigns. The game's really a board game that has been changed into computer software, with all its benefits, such as no dice and counter hassle, no CRT hassle (combat results table), no problems with a huge map or simulating the fog of war, everything being automatically calculated, and so on and so forth.\n\nThe counters represent divisions. You can also use battalions, regiments, and brigades, but smaller units are treated in a more abstract way. Each unit has a meticulously researched historical organisation and equipment. The game is played on a huge map consisting of 36,000 hexes. It simulates air war, logistics, weather, as well as amphibious and airborne landings. You can play against the AI or against a human opponent. Each turn represents a week.\n\nThe developer continuously supports this product. There have been numerous patches so far, fixing bugs, balancing gameplay, and generally improving the simulation.\n\nWith regard to complaints over the price of this gem, let's take a look at these board games by GMT ( http://www.gmtgames.com/c-16-east-front-series.aspx ):\n\n1. Barbarossa: Army Group Center, 1941 (mind you - only a small fraction of the Eastern Front) = $65\n2. Barbarossa: Army Group North, 1941 (again, only a small fraction of the Eastern Front) = $102\n3. Barbarossa: Army Group South, 1941 (again, only a small fraction of the Eastern Front) = $89\n4. Barbarossa: Crimea (a tiny fraction of the Eastern Front) = $79\n5. Barbarossa: Kiev to Rostov (again, only a small fraction of the Eastern Front) = $85\n6. Typhoon! (again, only a small fraction of the Eastern Front) = $75\n\nTOTAL: that's $65+$102+$89+$79+$85+$75=$495 (that's roughly €443 or £318) - and it still doesn't cover all the campaigns that Gary Grigsby's War in the East offers...\n\nAnother good case in point is Total War by HMS/GRD ( http://hmsgrd.com/wordpress/?page_id=16 ): take a look at the price of Total War. That's $234. It's a remake of Fire in the East, and it only covers the period from... the summer of 1941 to the spring of 1942... - a lot less than Gary Grigsby's War in the East...\n\nTo conclude, taking the above into account, the price, whether it's €51, €73, or €83 (including both add-ons), is really a bargain. Gary Grigsby's War in the East offers a lot more than all the above games taken together and it serves it in a computerised, automated, and a lot more comfortable and convenient form, for a much lower price. Of course, you need to like playing wargames to appreciate this.\n\nIf you're into realistic wargames and WWII simulations, I really recommend this product to you.","July 13, 2015","true","176.7"," 13 of 19 people (68%) found this review helpful","68","13","19","0","0"

Please note that I had this game before being available on Steam and have countless hours played before switching to a steam account to run the game.\n\nHaving said the above what I can say about this game is that the developers are still hard at work improving the game based on feedback from the community on their forums.  That in and of itself is a huge plus!!!  Playing either side gives you the feel that you are actually there commanding the units that actually took part in War in the East.

This game isn't for the feint of heart & will challenge you at every turn versus other players.  If you are looking for easy mode this game isn't for you.  If you love a challenge and see how well you place against others then I highly recommend this game.","May 24","true","129.4"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

Be advised this is a monster wargame.\n\n1941-45 @ one week per turn. Old school...I do my turn and then you do yours. Rinse and repeat until victory or (player) morale failure.\n\nDivision and Bde level (bns & rgts assigned at Corps/Army level, CoC modelled very well\n\nUnits tracked by various types of supply (fuel, ammo...) fatigue, experience, morale...oh and by squad, mg and tank\n\nThe course of the war is one of amazing highs and lows regardless of the side you choose. Risks will have to be taken and disasters WILL occur. It will flow historically more or less if losses are near historical levels and skill levels aren't too far off but more or less casualties can lead to a very different army than seen historically. For example...woe to the Russian who threw away too many lives in low odds attacks and careless encirclements in 1942. Instead of standing up to the nazi invaders toe to toe...the retreat may very well continue throughout 43. I have won the game as the Germans in 1944 (admittedly against the ai)...panzers still pushing with all that late war goodness. Also been stopped cold in 42.\n\nThe war in the east from 1941-45 was by far the most brutal and total war ever fought by mankind. If you are seriously interested in learning about this conflict (and for anyone interested in military history, all other conflicts pale in comparison) this game is the only choice to make. Your only other serious options are TOAW, dosbox with this game's predecessor and vassal with a good boardgame. For the grogs and children of the grogs I can't possibly recommend this game enough. Don't give the price a second thought. 2 years after you delve into this game do the math...dollars vs hours. It will be cheap at that point. The thing is you're not done. Do the math again after four years and then six. Yeah, it's one of those games.\n\nFor the impatient, for those not interested at looking at the Soviet-German war (yeah and Hungry, Romania, Slovakia, Finland, Croatia and even a division from neutral Spain!) in it's totality, for those demanding something looking and sounding 'awesome' or immediate gratification move along. This isn't for you.\n\nDo not be concerned at the age of this beast. Like a fine bottle of Scotch it has only improved with age. It is now very near a state of balance where any further changes carry both diminishing returns and the risks of unintended consequences.

I heard this is a very complicated game but I am shock how easy to get into it even without reading the manual.  Just right click to move and right click again to attack.  Of course eventually you will need to read the manual for better understanding regarding to rules like supply, production etc.  But this is far easiler to learn than I first believe.\n\nIf I have to pick some issues from this game.  I will say this game does not have enough tool tips.  There are too many symbols or short form that is not shown in the game unless reading the manual and remember what they mean.  There is no in game tutorial to show you things step by step.  I really would like it to copy the civilization manual system that the whole manual is integrated inside the game,    The rule book is pretty dry and it shows you tons of mathematical formulas and functions.  I will say it is essential if you are a competitor.  But it makes reading the manual very hard like reading a school book.  I will suggest just make the manaul without the formual but only the logic of different topics, and add the formulas and functions in the appendix section.  Afterall, this is war and in really we will never know how much more difficult to move through EZOC.\n\nIt looks like I critcize a lot about this game.  But in fact I am not.  I love this game.  I can easily give it a solid 9/10.  If it integrades the manual into the game and show more tips when I move the cursor to different symbol  I will give it a 10.  Very good wargame.

It is a game you will either spend tens (ok, hundreds) of hours with... or you will just not get over the first hurdle of user interface & the manual. If you get over the interface and the hefty manual (highly recommended for new players, 100's of pages of important stuff), you need to gain understanding a rather delicate web of interdependencies, between morale, supply, air raids, HQ, generals, encirclements and evacuation. Than, AI will be piece of cake - but it will take tens and tens of hours to get to stage when you need to start playing Soviet Union on Hard to get some challenge.\n\nHowever, the game begins when you start playing against humans. And you will find out that you have much to learn and that you do not know how to play. You will find that there are tricks, fine tricks and almost exploits. In any case, the game against expert player is quite different than even against very tough AI. Things are unfair, no matter which side you play... but also fun. You will understand that the system of interdependencies is much deeper and that micromanagement is much more important. I guarantee that during games against humans you will reach total despair, no matter which side you play.\n\nHint: choose Soviets for your first game against human - they can fight even after you made quite some mistakes. Germans, Germans require a player class or two better than the opponent to succeed. But expertly played Axis is a very challenging opponent, even for an expert Soviet. At least until you stabilize in '42-'43.\n\nTo sum up, the game if you choose to get deep into it, will take hundreds of hours of play.  Worth it? Worth it if moving symbols over hexes is your thing. However, be careful if your family situation is strained and you should not get into a very complex game which will take hundreds of hours of your life. And if you do not like complex games, that is not the game for you.\n\n\nPros:\nComplexity\nDetails\nMost complete warfare simulation of the Eastern Front\nReally well thought out - though one can appreciate the finer design only after hundreds of hours played\nCons:\nComplexity - not a game for everyone\nPredicting the results of battles can be frustrating and require a lot of skill (one needs to take into account all the variables, that is morale, supply, type of units fighting, arms in the units etc - the numbers on the counters are only rough guidelines). That is doubly frustrating against expert human players as they can improve supply, morale etc. by skilled play leading to more difficult prediction of the results - as you do not know everything due to fog of war.\nSome balancing issues when facing expert humans\nSimulation of warfare only; no option to simulate production, interfere with the units armaments, etc\nYour social life will be in danger if you like complex wargames\nCheck the AAR's here:  AAR Forum [www.matrixgames.com]\nMy opponent AAR (two year old) - myself playing Germans	[www.matrixgames.com]","July 17, 2015","true","81.8"," 6 of 11 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","6","11","0","0"

There are many unfriendly and rude people in this forum like user Pelton for example. They insult you even if you just express your oppinion about the game. The rudeness in this forum is quite amazing. And nobody is really monitoring the forum so it's basically Thunderdome. Who ever shouts the loudest wins. :-)\n\n\nTo sum it up: Game good! Matrix forum bad!","August 1, 2015","true","544.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","3","8","0","0"
