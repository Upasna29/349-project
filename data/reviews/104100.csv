Inside a Star-Filled Sky is exactly the type of game I'd expect to see win some kind of award at the IGF - but winning an award at the IGF doesn't necessarily mean it's a good game.\n\nInsidie a Star-Filled Sky is a novel concept and little more. The game itself is themes around the idea of recursion where you 'enter' power ups and enemies. While this is a nice idea it doesn't really impact the gameplay that much and each item you enter is effectively just the next room. I did appreciate the power up mechanics. You can collect up to 3 powerups and they can be combined in interesting ways to produce interesting effects. This fact alone, however, is not enough to merit a recommendation from me.\n\nAs a product, the game is very unpolished and feels like a prototype - for example editing the controls involves manually editing a config file. There's also no sound effects to speak of, just some ambiance music.\n\nThere are some nice ideas here but I don't feel the developer took time to flesh them out into a compelling gaming experience and instead delivered us a rough prototype.\n\nScore: 3.5/10","December 5, 2013","false","0.8"," 58 of 75 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","58","75","0","0"

That this game appears to have depth and complexity is itself an illusion. I can count on my fingers the number of new things you will encounter as you play through the levels. My first time, I went as low as level -40. I couldn't seem to figure it out and every time you die, you go down a level. But then I started over, and am currently stuck at around level 118. There is a room full of robots that shoot enough bullets to make a japanese top-down shooter choke, and so to get past it, I went "inside" one of the enemies to try and disable it's weapons through giving it weaker powerups. Instead, now I am trapped inside of it by more crazy robots.\n\nThe way I got as far as I have was not actually through a whole lot of careful planning or picking the right items. Instead, I find that I progressed faster by running straight past or through things to the exit. Since when you die you automatically get one of your three "power ups" replaced with about 6 life points, you can burn through those and get to the exit. But, having done this, I am now not strong enough to proceed.","August 5, 2014","true","6.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

The trick, though, is that everything is fractal; instead of grabbing a powerup you can shrink down inside it, and then shrink down inside an enemy inside of that, and so on. You have a procedurally-generated infinity to explore.\n\nExploring is all there really is to it, though.

What if you could enter an object in that level and find another level inside of that?" is basically the entire point of this game, and the answer is just that it'd be a procedurally generated game like so many other indie games nowadays, but wrapped in an attempt to make some kind of fancy artistic point out of it.\n\nHonestly, it's exactly what it looks like, though frequently far more boring than the screenshots depict. The game is described as: an "infinite, recursive, tactical shooter". By infinite and recursive, the designer of course means procedurally generated, and by tactical it means you'll often be sitting behind a corner waiting for the one time you can dash out without instantly dying, or choosing to run away into a different level because discretion is the better part of valor. If you're expecting good top-down shooter mechanics, look elsewhere.\n\nThe artistic point isn't worth $8, and while it managed to bamboozle me into buying the game, I have no idea how it confused reviewers like IGN's or GamePro's, who actually managed to play the game before writing their reviews.

The powerups you collect inside an enemy affect its abilities, the powerups you collect inside powerups affect the nature of the powerup you are in, and the powerups you collect inside yourself affect your own abilities. Only the last 3 powerups have an impact, and not until you leave the thing you're in and pop up to the level you entered it from. Every map has a square for popping out of it, so there is no "top" layer.\nIt can get a bit dizzying, but the awesome number of potential powerup combos, plus the strategy of altering the game elements around you to suit your needs, plus the difficulty scaling based on depth and powerup collection, plus the ability to plant your flag and mark those places where nobody has been before make this a fairly worthwhile game.

Now back to mine. Now back to your level. Now back to mine. Sadly, it isn't mine. But if you stopped shooting blindly and started deleveling enemies, it could look like mine.\n\nLook down. Back up. Where are we? You're inside yourself in the level your level could look like. What's in your hand? I have it. It's a power-up that increases your Rate of Fire. Look again. The power-up is now Bullet Size!\n\nAnything's possible when you play "Inside a Star-Filled Sky" and not cover-based rail shooters.\n\nI'm in a Health-Up.","June 6, 2011","true","1.4"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The powerups you collect inside an enemy affect its abilities, the powerups you collect inside powerups affect the nature of the powerup you are in, and the powerups you collect inside yourself affect your own abilities. Only the last 3 powerups have an impact, and not until you leave the thing you're in and pop up to the level you entered it from. Every map has a square for popping out of it, so there is no "top" layer.\nIt can get a bit dizzying, but the awesome number of potential powerup combos, plus the strategy of altering the game elements around you to suit your needs, plus the difficulty scaling based on depth and powerup collection, plus the ability to plant your flag and mark those places where nobody has been before make this a fairly worthwhile game. (My flag is a black glider on a blue field. Try to find it!)","August 9, 2011","true","3.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Featuring a recursive level diving type system that allows you to go into your enemies, power ups and even yourself and change aspects of the respective object to change the game around. The gameplay itself is much like many other twin stick shooter type deals but a lot more tactical.  I myself am not entirely sure who I'd recommend this to but it certainly is an interesting concept.","August 13, 2012","true","1.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
