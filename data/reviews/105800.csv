I am not really sure what the developers' intent was with this game... on the surface, it looks like a sort of casual interactive art piece showcasing a synergy of music and colors. But once you get deeper into it, there are increasing levels of challenge (and frustration), which go against the laid-back casual vibe. But what is it, exactly? I'm not really sure... I guess my best simple summary would be to say it's sort of like an unholy union of the artistic games "Flow" and "Flower" on the PS3 (if you've played/heard of those). Anyways, you play as some sort of little bug thing that can jump around and stick to plants. By jumping into floating spores, you release pollen that fills in seeds, which when filled, sprout new plants that allow you to reach new areas. You just keep exploring in this way until you find a special glowy thing called a "spectra", which ends the level. There are 15 levels (or "gardens", as they are called), each of which contains 5 spectra. So there is plenty of content to play through. While no major mechanics are introduced after the first few levels, the game mostly stays interesting throughout, due mostly to the diversity in the look and music. Each garden has a unique vibe, due to the music and color palette/design. As each spectra is collected, the levels evolve slightly to introduce more visual elements. It's a pretty neat effect. As I mentioned earlier, while the game is fairly simple at its core, some frustration creeps in during the latter portion of the game due to the introduction of really annoying enemies and some slightly more challenging platforming bits (the sometimes wonky controls don't help, either). It's nice for the challenge, but it also sort of goes against the enjoyable casual feel of the early parts of the game. It felt somewhat like the game had an identity crisis to me... but I dunno, maybe it's just me. That said, it is still a super enjoyable experience if you go into it not expecting some sort of blockbuster. It's a great experimental art piece that is perfect for those times when you just want to turn your mind off and get lost in a spaced out state of sights and sounds... and yes, that means it's definitely the perfect game for you if your favorite time of day is 4:20. But even if not, it's still an enjoyable experience and worth checking out.","August 13, 2013","true","16.7"," 153 of 176 people (87%) found this review helpful","87","153","176","0","1"

It has become my go-to game for when I've had enough of killing things, blowing things up, and other related virtual mayhem. Or, after rage-quitting the last five games in a row because they are deliberately obtuse or sadistically difficult, it serves as a good reminder of why I play games in the first place; to have fun and feel good about myself. PixelJunk Eden has those "Man, I'm good" moments when you clear an area, in the same way that very well done puzzle games do. It can have it's frustrating moments, like falling 50 stories after a long and complex climb, but they are always user error and not the fault of the game design. Difficulty progresses naturally and not without commensurate upgrades and new abilities. Time is made a valuable, albeit renewable, resource. It has the perfect balance of relaxing and challenging that makes it highly addictive to play. Adding to replay value are the achievements for clearing an area a second time or for activating all of a certain interactive object. The soundtrack is generally pleasant, in a techno-jazz kind of way, but I occasionally found it irritating and so played that area in silence. And as I've said, I do love the art direction, although some screens in the higher levels are downright hard on the eyes. It is still one of the most fun, refreshing, satisfying and addictive games I've played in a while, well worth the full price.\nhttp://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=489916563","August 20, 2015","true","12.1"," 65 of 65 people (100%) found this review helpful 4 people found this review funny","100","65","65","4","4"

However, after only 30 minutes in the game, I was sorely, sorely disappointed.\n\nFirst of all, you need to dissociate this game with the console versions. According to a good friend of mine, the game is far more fun on the console, because it has multiplayer. PC does not.\n\nThe game involves you controlling a little bug thing who has to leap about flowers to activate "Spectra" while gathering enough pollen to grow plants (never explained). The game has absolutely no story whatsoever. The game revolves around the process of shooting your silk, spinning around and guesstimating where you are meant to go next, which almost always leads to 90% of your time thinking "what the hell am I meant to do?"\n\nAnyway. I played 9.4 hours of it, completing the "Eden" aspect of the game, and would not recommend it.\n\n-Nilesy","August 2, 2012","false","9.4"," 57 of 74 people (77%) found this review helpful","77","57","74","0","0"

Never have been. They usually feel way to linear and restricted to me, and hardly ever offer exciting game mechanics.\n\nWhile PixelJunk Eden technically is a platform game, this label wouldn't do much justice to it, as it truly is so much more! The game mechanics are simple yet innovative and the gameplay is very fluent. The player can move around freely over the entire map, explore every corner and in the meanwhile develop the map as it grows with you (by seeding plants).\n\nNo need to use the keyboard; the mouse does it all for you. This however doesn't mean it's a simple point-and-click game. Different combinations of mouse buttons make you jump in different ways and it all feels very natural.\n\nThe artwork is amazing and the 15 maps all offer something new. The minimal house music compliments the game very well.\n\nIs there nothing negative to mention about the game? Of course, there always is. While the gameplay has the potential to be very relaxing, the timer that decreases your health can be stressful. You have to pick up crystals to recharge it, but these are not always around in the later stages of the map and it can be a little frustrating to die just before reaching your goal. In my opinion your health shouldn't be affected by time that much, but rather more by the enemies you have to defeat. These do some occasional damage, but more often interfere with your jumps.\n\nOverall a very nice game with high replay value. You can play for just 10 minutes or for several hours, which makes it a game you can easily come back to. Even the main menu is fun to play around with.","January 4, 2014","true","73.0"," 24 of 26 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","24","26","0","0"

To traverse these levels you have a jump and grip/swing mechanic, the physics involved in which are slightly “floaty” therefore offering a good degree of mid-air readjustment. Reaching the higher areas of a level requires the player to pollinate plants, a process achieved by picking up nearby items, or destroying enemies in the vicinity, with larger pollen rewards generated for destroying multiple enemies in a single jump. Players are required to accomplish all of this against the clock, though that clock can be topped up by acquiring some items dotted around the gardens.\n\nThere are no great bold innovations to be seen here, the pleasure of the game is derived from the fact that the design of the game mechanics, the visuals and the sound all come together to make a very pleasant gaming experience. In an odd juxtaposition of perception and content, the easy going almost Zen-like meditative vibe of Eden in the early stages is tempered with some really rather infuriating moments in the later in the game, but that’s alright, because you can simply drop back a few levels and do a run through an earlier level for no other reason than the fact the world of Eden is a very pleasant one to visit.\n\nFinally it should be noted this is the definitive version of the game, controls redesigned for mouse and keyboard, several annoyances ironed out from the original PSN version (Thankfully you no longer have to collect all 5 items in one run to clear a level), all of the Encore content included, and the addition of a nifty “warp” function which allows for the rapid repair of any mistimed jump.","December 18, 2013","true","13.4"," 28 of 34 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","28","34","0","0"

The game's supposed to be relaxing, and the music stressed me a lot.\n- Instructions are also terrible, you receive wrong/incomplete hints all the time (like, they say you need to press the drop button to drop fast, but you have to press the spin button as well). Also, some controls are a bit counter-intuitive (when you wanna jump from plant A to plant B, you have to press the jump button twice, or else you'll be caught by your own silk thread... the silk thread could've easily worked for as long you hold the jump button, for example). Also, after clearing 1/3 of the game, I was still wondering what "orbitation" is, even after they've mentioned a few times (as if I already knew what it was).\n- The "health" mechanic (I'm not even sure if you die when they run out) with the crystals is just another thing that breaks the flow of the game, making you stop to collect those orbs, or whatever they're called\n- Each level has 5 Spectra you need to find (like Super Mario 64's stars). It would really be great if you could find them all in one go, but you're removed from the stage every time you get one. Not only that, but if you unlock a new level, you're forced to try it immediately. So, if you're like me and wanna complete a level before moving to the next, you'd have to enter the new level only to quit it, then navigate back through the hub to where you were (which is not always an easy task). It totally breaks the flow.\n\nIt's not a bad game, but it's just meh, and those negative details ended up ruining the whole experience for me.","September 8, 2015","false","4.6"," 27 of 39 people (69%) found this review helpful","69","27","39","0","0"

It is a REALLY good puzzle game.\n\nThe objective is to control a bug through spinning and rolling and make it hit spores and then collect the pollen so that it germinates nearby seeds which will grow further branches which you can now latch onto. You must navigate each map with your grappling silk hook and find five spectra (glowing bulb spirits) so that you can unlock more maps. There is a total of 75 spectra in all. The game is visually impressive with it's abundant in  your face vibrant colors and patterns and it's comprehensive list of trendy instrumental music scores. It's peaceful and relaxing, but it is also very fast if you are to take on the challenge of getting the whole five spectra in a single course in a single run. There is no dillydallying then. The further you progress the more interesting the different mechanics of the game.\n\nWhat I love about this game is that there is NOTHING like it.

Gameplay consists of leading a small creature from plant to plant or to rocks via jumping or spinning. In later gardens there are additional movement and puzzle mechanics which complicate the game in a positive way. The game introduces new mechanics slowly, which keeps frustration to a minimum. There's some need for planning and quick movements at times, but it's not a game that relies 100% on twitch reactions. The main goal is to find all 5 spectra in each garden and there are additional challenges such as collecting all 5 spectra in 10 minutes or unlocking all seeds in a garden. You can go as quickly or as slowly as you want through gardens, which is a very attractive freedom to me. It has an odd graphic style which is pretty fresh. Each garden has its own graphic style and color scheme, which change as you collect spectra. The music is made by an independent Kyoto artist and is a good selection of electronic trance with light beat (get the soundtrack bundle, it's worth it).\n\nOverall, this is a solid puzzle game that has a lot of fresh and interesting attributes - a great thing to play and just relax with.","July 8, 2014","true","11.7"," 13 of 16 people (81%) found this review helpful","81","13","16","0","0"

Don't be tempted to go for the "Open All Seeds" achievements on any but the first few gardens (levels). The game gives you no tools to find any seeds that you've missed and most of the gardens later in the game are huge with at least a couple seeds in really obscure locations. To top it off there is a finite amount of life rejuvenating crystals in each map so there is a very real cap to how long you can spend searching before you can't sustain yourself anymore, die and have to start all over. I likely would have given this game a higher rating had I stopped playing at 10 hours instead of 20.\n\nAnd what a pleasant first 10 hours it was. The experience included eye-catching visuals, a unique and fitting soundtrack, simple yet challenging enough gameplay and some good level design with plenty of variety. It had a relaxing feel to it. In the early to mid levels health crystals were plentiful enough that I hardly paid attention to the life bar. I'll admit that the soundtrack didn't appeal to my tastes but there seems to be a lot of praise out there for it. There were a couple tracks I liked and the rest at least weren't grating.\n\nIn my mind the life system that is constantly ticking down and needing to be refilled was a very poor design choice for this type of game. In a game all about exploration, collecting things and taking in the sights and sounds, why impose an unnecessary time constraint? It would have been better to let players set their own pace and have a more standard health bar so that the enemies still have teeth.\n\nDespite my gripes I’d still recommend this game if you treat it casually. Bring too much hardcore gamer mindset to it and it’s likely to go sour on you.","February 4, 2014","true","20.7"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","7","8","0","0"

I like having games I can play when I want more casual, relaxing gameplay, and PixelJunk Eden serves this purpose very, very well.\n\nIf you like artsy, atmospheric platformers with good pacing, then you will really enjoy this game.\n\nThe aesthetics are spectacular! The artstyle and background is very refreshing - the theme is plants in a garden (in a variety of colors depending on the level). The sounds and music are very good and add to the relaxing atmosphere emitted by the game.\n\nThe controls are fairly simple and easy to learn - instructions are given whenever a new mechanic is introduced. The tutorial is quick and painless - your primary objective is to find these special items throughout the level. The learning curve is minimal - the most you have to worry about is completing your objective before your time runs out, however, it is quite easy to obtain the collectibles that increase your time limit.\n\nDuring gameplay, there are various pollen-like objects floating around the area, and hitting them will cause the pollen particles to float toward the nearest "plant-budding" area. When enough pollen has accumulated within the circle, touching it with your character will cause a plant to sprout. These structures are essential because your character can stick to any part of the plant, allowing you to jump/move to higher areas. Later, you will unlock a rappel ability, allowing you to swing for a finite amount before propelling yourself in a particular direction. Furthermore, if your rope touches any time-increasing collectibles or pollen-objects, they will automatically be collected.\n\nYou have a time limit, and collecting certain items will increase your limit by a few bars (the larger object will refill it by a great deal). As you progress through the game, you will also unlock a teleport-reset ability (very useful for when you accidentally fall a large distance), however, using this requires you to spend a portion of your time limit gauge.\n\nAs you collect more of the spectra (level completion) items, you will eventually unlock more gardens. Interestingly, whenever you first unlock a new garden, you MUST complete at least one portion of that new garden (get the first spectra item). Also, as you unlock more gardens, the appearance of the main menu area will liven up with beautiful plant-like structures. There are also various random hint nodes all across the menu that you can move to in order to receive fairly-helpful advice.\n\nOverall, if you are into atmospheric platformers with a unique artstyle, you must try out this game.\n\nDefinitely recommend!\n\nCheers,\nDJSF @DJSF's Rogue Reviews","September 29, 2014","true","1.8"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","3"

Might be nicer if it were set laterally 2D rather than up/down 2D, so there were no gravity effects.  (NOTE: when you jump off, your momentum resets to a jump momentum in the direction you jump.  you don't get the momentum of the object you were standing on even if it was moving.)\n* having enemies that interrupt your movements, and having a time limit.  (running out of time just sends you back to the original starting point of the stage, though.)\n* cursor occasionally hard to see against various features and background.\n\nOverall, a generally enjoyable experience for chilling.  Occasionally irritating when you miss a bunch of jumps/landings in a row, but overall decent.\n\nFor reference: I've completed the first three gardens, and unlocked about 6 gardens so far.\n\n(Disclosure: I bought this game on the Steam store when it was deeply discounted.)","June 8, 2015","true","3.3"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","80","4","5","0","0"

I loved it! It is a colorful game, and the techno soundtrack puts you at a decent pace which relaxes and calms you(or maybe techno gives you a headache?). It doesn't really have a story-you're a small creature growing colorful silhouettes of plants by collecting flora-looking objects called... wait, let's not spoil it. But in short this game, even though boiling it down to its structure makes it seem tedious and repetitive, keeps you engaged and interested, even when calmed while playing it. It's unique too! I especially liked how the levels changed colors and became decently harder as you played through them. And despite it being timed, you can replenish the timer so you have plenty of time to do other things while playing. The negatives of the game pretty much fix themselves.\n\nI have only one problem with this game, and it's just on this port-there aren't many video settings, which means if the game runs slow for you you're pretty much doomed. And it runs slow for me. It's an absolute killer. But as long as you have a powerful enough machine, this won't be a problem at all, and you can enjoy it as much as you want. Another con is that it used to be a co-op game where you could play online with strangers or your friend could pick up the other controller and join, but if you never cared for multiplayer, that's not a problem either. I'm also noting here for people who started out playing the PS3 version that the PC controls are a bit awkward to adjust to, but it's definitely not impossible.\n\nIn short? The game has vibrant, well-animated artwork, its physics are sensical and easily adjusted to, the goal is simple and you can start it up whenever without worrying about where you were in the gameplay.

You play this little figure with floppy ears on its nose, hoping from one plant to plant in a giant garden, smashing into these drifting spores to create more plants, gathering amoebas to help stave off the timer while you look for five 'Spectras' in each garden. Its not a profound premise, but at least original.\n\nLet's say it right now, this is a pretty game. When you find a rhythm you'll fall into a zen mode watching your character zip around on a dynamic and pleasing back drop, charmed by the smooth animations of the blossoming plants swaying slowly in an unfelt wind. Its accompanied by a minimalist electronic soundtrack done by graphic designer 'Baiyon'; I never heard of him either nor would I say his music is that memorable. But the rest of the design team must of been proud enough too give him top billing. But I think that is my biggest problem with the game.\n\nIts too self indulgent...\n\nBecause of PixelJunk Eden's engrossing and viberate art style, actually playing the game can be very troublesome, very often, not to mention slow. The controls require careful study to ensure you've executed a jump successful, else you being falling a ways and starting you long climb again. The game will let you recover yourself, but the penalty too do so makes it seldom worthwhile. And if you fall all the way to the bottom of the garden, you come to understand how easy it is to get lost in a garden (but the menu is the worst for this, of all things), The game is also very unforgiving with its timer, too many times I'm desperately seeking out a batch of amoebas to spare my life; and yet the scant enemies in the game are a total pushover, requiring an intention bump to split them up and second strike to finish most of them. All in all it almost feels like the gameplay mechanics were an afterthought.\n\nOddly this game kindly reminds me alot of the Diddy Kong Racing remake for the Nintendo DS back in 2007. That otherwise stirling game was ruined by its ♥♥♥♥ poor impletation of the DS controls as much as PixelJunk Eden was hurt by its ruling design aesthetic. Perhaps if the games had a slightly less intrusive style I could come to grips with its gameplay. But like many other indie Magnum opus' out there, PixelJunk Eden is just too 'Arty' for its own good.","June 18, 2012","false","4.6"," 12 of 22 people (55%) found this review helpful","55","12","22","0","0"

If the others do, I'll probably re-purchase them all well just to support the developers. This game is, at its heart, a platformer, but the experience is enhanced by the abstract stylization and the awesome soundtrack by Japanese artist, Baiyon. The timer on the levels may make the game frustrating for some, as it "forces" a pace that one may otherwise decide to do leisurely. While the controls have been "reimagined" for the PC and mouse usage, I still find the game more comfortable and intuitive to play using a gamepad, especially when navigating the trickier parts of the levels high up (though the new checkpoint system also mitigates the frustration of falling back to the ground).

Instead you collect pollen to grow plants and flowers which allow you to leap and soar upward to new heights. The game offers hallucinogenic visuals and complementary music. It's a soothing game for the most part, that is, until you find yourself plummeting to the floor because you missed that last jump. Climb higher and higher to find Spectra in each garden to unlock more gardens. Each garden gets progressively harder with enemies that stand in your way. Simple, yet challenging, Eden definitely offers a gaming experience like nothing else.","January 29, 2014","true","6.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's beautiful and relaxing at first, just swinging around and exploring the world. You jump and spin around, collecting pollen and growing plants, which allows you to explore more of the garden. The controls remain simplistic, but as you progress to new gardens, the environment has new mechanics which are cool, interesting, and sometimes downright frustrating. That won't stop you from coming back for more though!\n\nNon-linear gameplay allows you to skip forward to any garden you have unlocked or replay any previous garden, and there is no set path for exploring within. Growing new pieces of the garden looks and feels like you're painting new pieces of the environment. It's engaging, both visually and mechanically.\n\nI enjoyed the music at first, but I couldn't listen to it for long. The ever-present pulsing beat made it feel like I'd been in a nightclub too long.

The gameplay is somewhat open, in that although there is a goal in each level (search for and collect the "spectra"), there are a few different ways you can approach it. You can just jump around as much as possible, searching around for the spectra, fleeing from the occasional enemy, and sometimes making a mistake that lands you back at the bottom of the level. Or you can focus on collecting pollen and building the branches - playing it safe - until you just happen across the spectra naturally.\n\nThe game is (intentionally) slow paced. Each level is basically the same as the last except that you meet new enemies and unlock new abilities as you complete each "garden". The soundtrack has a very "indie" feel to it, but it's decent - just a little repetetive.\n\nIt runs decently on my 4 year-old low-end laptop that only runs TF2 at 10 fps. The game is clearly designed to use a mouse (some of the abilities require a scroll-wheel), but I have no problem playing it on my touchpad.\n\nIn the end, I'm not entirely sure why I enjoy the game, but it serves as a good way to take a short break from work/studies and relax. It's carefully designed to be moderately engaging but almost never frustrating.","October 26, 2014","true","5.7"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

The PC version fixes the most annoying aspect of the PS3 release (having to get 1 spectra, then 2, then 3... then 5 per level) drastically cutting down on forced repetition.\n\nWorth it for the grooves and trippy visuals alone, but the gameplay is quite fun here, especially with 2 or 3 people playing co op (though some harder levels make co op a fussy affair).\n\nIf you want something a little different, this is a great game. Each new level feels like a fresh adventure and I felt myself willing to progress if only to see what would happen next. The world evolves each Spectra (collectible "goal" items) you grab, adding more and more vibrancy to the flat and stylistic levels.

You can only jump and guide the flying a little and that's it. You can hit things that start growing more platforms for you to grab or jump at things that give you points. Too bad that the jumping feels terrible and here where the relaxing never happens: you can't be sure which parts of the "flowers" your fetus can grab and which are the ones that you just fly through. You keep on jumping upwards but if you can't get a hold you drop back down and start the climbing again.\n\nThis is not what I find relaxing.\n\nThen there's the art which comes down to your preferences. I disliked the shroomy atmosphere and the soundtrack that puts you into elevator mode for all eternity. If it's club music I start going out to libraries instead. More action, more fun and probably better beats too.\n\nLuckily I got this game from a bundle so I basically didn't pay a dime for it. There's also been some news about indie gamemakers fearing for their income and this game is one of the examples why the market isn't what it used to be. This game is pay2lose.","August 26, 2014","false","7.5"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","18","36","0","1"

Eden is a near-hallucinatory experience with a fantastic soundtrack, established style, and unique gameplay. If Dig Dug stopped digging and decided to roam the trees and coral mountains of distant worlds in pursuit of the mysterious Spectra- using nothing but a grappling hook and mastery of momentum, the result might be similar to Eden. You can't fly in Eden, instead you must master the game's physics and use the environments to your advantage. I think that somewhere hidden in this game is the implication that you are a sort of bee/spider-angel spreading pollen for God in the gardens of Eden. But then... where do all of these music references (encores and oscillators, etc.) fit in to that idea? I don't know...

What the hell was the hype about? I can only assume it's because it was aired on the PS3, and the people playing this are new to this sort of platformer.    One of the first games I played back in 1983 or thereabouts was called "Bugaboo the Flea", and involved a little flea, trying to jump left or right to climb out of a hole, while a pterodactyl stalked him.  If you like this game, go back and see the similarities to that game, and then tell me with a straight face that this is totally original ;)\n\nGood:  The music is oookay.. It's not Circuits or Bastion, but it's okay.  The graphics are minimalist, but nice..  Rotatey-scaley-sprite. The controls are oookay.  Take a bit of getting used to, but it's manageable with a touchpad... The first few levels are designed to be fun and casual.. Enjoyable...\n\nBad:  But Level 8 is the watershed..\n\nAt level 8, the game goes from fun to absolutely dowright, massively, fist-clenchingly shoutily, infuriating.  As you can see, I put quite a few hours into the game.. Most of them trying to get the last "spectra" in Level 8.  I got pretty good in the end.. I could pyoing up, bounce, swing, pyoing, bounce.. etc..  over to the last island...\n\nBut... If you ♥♥♥♥ up and fall off JUST ONCE, you must stop and go find more energy, which takes energy....  If you call, you must start aaaaaall the way from the begining. Using the "jump reset" uses too much energy... If you rush about, get energy, swing over..  you cannot  make a single mistake, cos getting energy, takes energy... What makes it worse.. I think there's a one-way switch at the very end that , once switched, means you cannot proceed!  You MUST exit and start the WHOLE THING over again!!!   I tried to undo the 'flip' but it wouldn't!   Here's a MASSIVE Tip for you.  Before you collect the fourth spectra, make sure you have ALMOST ALL of the plants grown to get down to the fifth one, or else you will be stopped cold at this level.\n\nI can see which way this game is going...\n- Make the islands smaller and smaller.\n- Move the 'seeds' further and further offscreen requiring more blind leaps.\n- Add more enemies that come and snap your silk while trying to line up a perfect jump\n- Make the drop back to the beginning further and further.\n\nGah!\n\nThe energy thing just made this game too effing infuriating for me.  If it was used up slower,  or there was more energy dropped by popping pollen, that would be less aggravating.. But the way it is now... Naw.  I got better games to be playing.   This one just makes my blood boil.  My wife, hearing me shout "F*** YOU!!!" at the game for the umpteenth time, just said "If it's not fun, why are you playing it?".  I just looked up, thought "dammit, she's right!", and uninstalled Eden.  I couldn't be happier right now.\n\nTo all my friends who may read this:  Do not play this game.  It's a time sink, with levels designed to just get harder and harder, and pee you off more and more.  Go play Circuits, Bastion, Kerbal Space Program, VVVVVVV, Terraria,   anything.. just not this.","October 11, 2014","false","22.2"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/recommended/105800/","cyrilpanda","Cyril","http://steamcommunity.com/id/cyrilpanda/","596 products in account","A generally great game brought down by one odd design choice. The time limit, specifically; it goes against the nature of an exploration game like this mostly is. Fortunately the main stresses of the time limit can be avoided by playing the game "incorrectly"; open all the seeds (or just as many as you need to if you don't care about the achievements) before getting any spectra, and you tend to have plenty of time to get everything without having to worry too often. That aside... pretty great game. The art style is fantastic, the gardens all are pretty unique too. There are gimmicks in some of them that vary in quality, but only are really a bit too obstructive in one level. The Eden Encore levels, also, are all quite good, better than the main game even if they're generally more difficult. All-in-all if you can learn how to play the game to get the most enjoyment out of it you will likely get a lot of enjoyment in the end.\nNote: Don't care for the music, personally, but it's not a major issue.","March 18, 2014","true","15.6"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

The atmosphere, art direction, and music was solid, but thats about it. The platforming is ok, but control over the character isn't very good. There is like no direction on where to go. If you have collected a certain number of "whatever theyre called" and you go back to a level there is no indication where the other ones are. Sometimes the screen flashes but thats not every time and only when you're close. This leads to a lot of wondering around. Also they are sometimes in a space that you can't figure out how to get to. The level map has no direction as its just a bunch of random circles in an open area....something much more streamlined and helpful would have been nice. The swinging is really touchy and doesn't work like its supposed to. Sometimes you won't press the button but it will keep making you make ropes on things. Other times you will press the button and it won't make a rope. Controlling the swinging doesn't work as easy as it should. Also the jumping feels a little too floaty and has a lack of control in the air. There is no story as well. The game is jsut very repetitive, you just collect seeds to grown plants and try to wander around and get higher to collect a seed to open a new area. There are like no enemies and they don't really do anything. There are no bosses and every level feels the EXACT same and you do the EXACT same, but with a different background. The other big problem is the progression structure. I don't know why pixeljunk thinks adding in this stupid collectible game to move forward is a good idea, but it's stupid here. You have to replay levels to try and find more seeds to open up more. I got multiple seeds from every level I played and you have to get more from each one as you progress. I had beaten every area I had and still had to get 4 more seeds to progress 1 level further. With the lack of direction of where to get them I just got sick and gave up. It's not as good as shooter. 5.5/10.","February 28, 2015","false","5.9"," 0 of 2 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","2","0","1"

Your goal is essentially to get to the top of your garden, but if you miss a platform or the physics engine is bored, you'll fall to the bottom and have to work your way back up. The physics of this game make me cry. The platforming is sticky, but really, REALLY floaty, to control yourself in midair, you have to hold down the mouse button, but if you want to land on a platform you have to let go of the mouse button before you reach the platform. Trust me when I say this is far more annoying than it sounds. You'll more often than not have the floaty controls send your little dude plummetting to the ground, which should cause you to not be very "zen".\n\nThe physics are slightly broken aswell. If you're on a spring board, and are being pushed upwards by the kinetic force, if you then JUMP as the spring reaches its apex, you should be launched into the air, right? haha, no. In Eden, that is the WORST thing you can possibly do, as this will make you fall through the platform. To get the biggest air you need to press the jump button when the platform has the most POTENTIAL energy, in other words, springboards in this game work the exact opposite of how they work in real life.\n\nIf you can get used to the appauling physics and infuriating gameplay though, Eden is actually pretty fun. Solid idea, pretty graphics, rewarding completionist title and great soundtrack. If you don't have a heart condition or anger issues, please try this "zen" game.","September 2, 2014","true","10.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

In the background is a mellow, bassy melody, some plucky synths, and some whirrs and beeps. I'm reminded immediately of Flower, but that's not going to last long. Click a mouse button, and I am introduced to my player character/avatar/whathaveyou: a little seed-looking Pokemon-like thingy. A quick wikipedia search informs me that the creature is called a "Grimp". Adorable. He jumps and tumbles around from plant to plant, and then enters a wormhole to what I am informed is "Garden 01: volpe". A rhythmic Electro track starts pulsing, and I'm off, bouncing through the environment at warp speed.\n\nThe gameplay is beautifully simple: jump from platform to platform to collect energy, defeat enemies, and gather the main objective of the game: weird glowy things called Spectra. Use physics (mainly gravity and centripetal force) to propel yourself great distances, crash through obscene numbers of little balls of pollen, and collect the five spectra found in each garden. Along the way you collect pollen from defeated enemies and use it to grow new flowers, branches, and tufts of grass to allow you to climb further up and around a variety of floating structures. As you grow more flowers, collect more spectra, and unlock more gardens, the world around you continues to grow and pulsate, and you got lost in the rhythm as you cannonball from branch to glowing branch.\n\nThe challenge is two-fold: your Grimp can run out of energy, which must be collected by either finding them around some of the trickier platforms or by making a combo of multiple enemies or mid-air plant growths without landing from a jump. Then the garden levels start getting a bit hectic (their names also get progressively more snazzy. Garden 02 is "Bord de Iac" , and it gets stranger from there). Some gardens float almost entirely in the air, punishing you for falling off. Teleporters and more powerful enemies are introduced, the wind might pick up, and in one garden gravity is shifted back and forth, up and down, sometimes tossing you across the map without warning.\n\nThere is also an Eden Encore section of the game: 5 additional gardens, but at this time I have not entered them. The first 10 were intense to begin with, and I've 100% completed the first seven but that last spectra in the eighth is proving to be a doozy.\n\nThis sublime combination of fast-paced navigation, breathtaking luminescent environments, dynamic and challenging gameplay, and techno beats combine to make PixelJunk Eden the grooviest platformer since Rayman 3.","November 10, 2015","true","7.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Infact, every move you can do in the game is mapped to your mouse.\n\nI would definitely reccommend it to a casual gamer that just wants to kill some time.","December 30, 2013","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The Steam version includes the Encore DLC pack which is nice. Controls we're a bit weird for me at the beginning because I used to play the console version, but now I think it's actually easier with the mouse.\n\nI saw a lot of reviews / posts about this PC port is a fail, but I think they resolved these issues by now because I haven't experienced any issues so far.\n\nThe only thing I cannot say for sure about this game is wether or not multiplayer got ported too;\nOn the PS3 version you could hook up an extra controller and play with up to 3 friends, this was awesome, but is there anyone who can confirm it works on PC too? The "amount of players" indicator is showing in my garden, so I would assume so, but I can't test this at this point because Windows 10 preview doesn't play well with DualShock Controllers yet :P\n\n\nAnyway, if you love atmospheric no brainers with an awesome soundtrack, be sure to get this game!\n","May 31, 2015","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The visuals in this game are amazing and the level designs are creative and each unique in their own way, each level has a different feel to it. There are a few draw back unfortunately, first and foremost is the music, it's a repetivive dance track that varies in each stage but to me after hearing the same loop for the time i spent on the level i found myself turning the music off. My only other gripe with the game are the controls, it's very hard to get your player to go where you want it to go, enemies are hard to take down in odd situations, and you may find yourself doing the same jump several times over (i did, i believe it was level 6 or 7...very odd jump to get one of the required 'Spectras'), granted it's an odd game where (i think) your a little...something, collecting pollen to sprout seeds to find these little fairy looking things (Spectras). All in all it is an enjoyable game, something you can sit back and relax before the controls drive you mad.

The music for the game was composed by a man who is referred to in game as Baiyon. Indie games are projects involving smaller teams with stricter budgets and often showcase a much needed level of creativity in the gaming industry today.\n\nThe game involves a tadpole like creature soaring seamlessly through lush environments and vibrant flora in order to collect a special type of object called Spectra.\n\nThe levels are referred to as gardens and the player takes an active role in their creation. Various floating pollen clouds are scattered through the gardens and touching them causes the closest un-blossomed flower to begin to bloom.\n\nAs the plants grow the garden bursts into life and new visual imagery and heights can be reached. As the player continues through the gardens the flowers blooming become increasingly larger and more detailed.\n\nThe music in the game is what sets it apart from a lot of other games in the gaming industry. Entirely composed by Baiyon, the soundtrack showcases amazing techno and sublime trance that adds to the immersive experience of the game.\n\nPixeljunk Eden is a captivating and innovative game idea that offers players of all ages a visually spectacular and musically rich experience.","December 17, 2013","true","31.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It is a unique take on a platformer but with several twists.  The basic premise is you are looking for "Spectra" of which each garden contains a total of five.  You are a "Grimp" which has the ability to jump and cling to plants as well as collect pollen which is used to boost your score and to pollenate plant seeds.  When you jump into the pollenated seeds they sprout plants which give you access to more of the level or perhaps a handy platform/cannon in case you make a mistake jumping.\n\nThroughout the course of the first several gardens you will gain a few upgrades and you unlock more gardens by collecting more "Spectra".  The art style and music are outstanding and make this game worth a try just to experience that.  The controls are pretty solid especially if played with a mouse as you get precision aiming for your jumps.\n\nThere's something very calming about flying around the levels collecting pollen and taking out enemies.  It's as casual or hardcore as you want it to be as when a garden is beaten (all five "Spectra" collected) you can revisit the garden to try and get all five at once (can be challenging and some "Spectra" are quite challenging to collect in their own right).  Note that you cannot fly around forever as you must collect "Crystals" to keep your oscillator in tune or you will fail the level and take a decent hit on your score.  Thankfully "Crystals" are liberally spread out throughout the garden and some can be spawned by jumping into pollentated seeds or by getting combos.\n\nOverall I recommend this game and I bought it purely on impulse not really knowing what to expect.  I hope you enjoy it!","January 1, 2014","true","17.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I really like the atmosphere created by the game - the music, the colors, the concept. I also really like this type of ambient puzzle game. I bought this game really hoping for a good, relaxing puzzle game that I can play when I don't really want to think about much, and the game definitely delivers in this regard.\n\nBut two things really break it for me. Entering and exiting levels sucks. You can't just pick a level to play in. You have to search all over for the entrance to the level. And if that particular level happens to net you one of those things that you're collecting, it will shoot you out of the level and on to the next, wether you're done or not.\n\nThe second thing is the energy. Sometimes, I just want to be able to float around and explore, but I am always having to worry about how much energy I have and finding those energy capsules so I don't die. This game would be so much better if you have the option to play with or without energy. As it is, it adds a level of stress to the game that I really just don't want when I'm playing a game that I want to be able to relax in and turn my mind off while playing.","July 7, 2014","true","6.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I suppose technically it'd be a puzzle platformer in some sort of loose sense, but the puzzles are mostly about exploration, and the platforming is very floaty and mostly involves swinging around on a tether, not precision jumping on platforms. It's really about how you get from here to there, and you're not usually particularly in a hurry to do it (there is a time limit, but you can collect things to restore how much time you have left), and you don't even necessarily know where "there" is other than a general direction until you find it. The controls are very simple, and there are only a handful each of enemies and basic elements the levels are constructed from, which are introduced one at a time throughout the game, but despite that each level has a distinct theme and personality and feels entirely unique. There generally isn't much especially difficult in the game, but it feels satisfying to fully explore a level and complete everything in it after you've discovered everything about it.","August 20, 2013","true","14.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The best description of this game that I can think of is "zen arcade". You control a little character which can jump and swing about, collecting things and generally exploring.\n\nI found that exploring each garden (ie. level) with its different "ecosystem" and striving to make every seed grow to be a great deal of fun. There is a lot of replayability if you enjoy beating your own, or other people's high scores.\n\nAll in all, I would say that this game is interestingly quirky, and I love it for that.\n\nGameplayThere are five fancy looking icons (called spectra) on each level and you need to collect them. That's about the entire goal of the game. In order to reach the five icons you need to collect pollen to make seeds grow so that you have more plants to climb up and swing off of. Although this sounds quite simple, if you're like me, don't underestimate the joy of exploration.\n\nThe gameplay itself is rather relaxing and is (usually) enhanced by the colours and art style. I say usually because there were some levels where I found the moving background to be very unpleasant and disorientating (although I do realise this is meant to make the levels more challenging, I don't like feeling ill).\n\nControlsI found the movement controls to be engaging, easy to grasp and a little harder to master. It can become frustrating when you're trying to release from your swing at the right time in order to get the perfect trajectory to hit quite a small landing pad which isn't even on the screen when you launch! This makes some levels quite challenging, but I never felt like it was completely beyond me to get through them.\n\nStorylineThere isn't a storyline per se because there isn't anything much to read. It does feel like you go through a journey with your strange little character, and you get a sense that you're restoring order to the gardens in some way.\n\nI'd say that this game's story is more about your own experience of playing it rather than anything else. It was interesting.\n\nSoundThe music is very upbeat, modern and abstract to my ear. You may infer from that statement that I'm not a fan of modern, abstract music, however I didn't find the music in this game to be obnoxious. It creates an interesting atmosphere and certainly supports the stylized concept the creators envisioned.\n\nGraphicsGenerally I'd say that the graphics aren't astonishing, it's more about the design of the game. It has clearly been designed and has some interesting layered effects to give depth to each garden. I fully appreciate the careful balance between texture and flat colour to create a bold contrast and powerful visual environment for this game.\n\nEach level, or garden, is randomly coloured each time you enter it. This gives the game an interesting design aspect because it's essentially experimenting with variation of colour and repetition of shape (garden layout).\n\nFor most readers though, the important thing is that the graphics make the game what it is, and they are functionally relevant.\n\nPros+ easy to learn, hard to master\n+ replayability of gardens\n+ bold graphic style creates a unique world\n+ real sense of free exploration despite finite garden sizes\nCons- purposefully disorientating levels can cause motion sickness\n- the bold style gets old after a while\n\nHelp Me Help YouIf you did not find this review helpful, I would really appreciate your constructive criticism - tell me why it wasn’t helpful for you. It’s my hope to make the reviews that I do take the time to write up, as helpful as they possibly can be.\n\nRothana's Steam Review ArchiveFor those that are interested in seeing more of my reviews, I have set up an archive of them at an external website. I don't earn anything off of this at all, it's just a little side project that I add to when I can. Steam won't let me create a direct link though, so you'll need to make your own way to the URL I describe now: rothana dot weebly dot com\n\nFootnotes\n*Any prices that I mention are in CDN because that is what I see. The primary price I list at the top is the price that I bought the game at.\n**I will not be keeping an eye on whether the links are up to date, so if they are broken I apologise. Remember that these are external websites and I'm just trying to be helpful - I'm not responsible for the content on the other end.\n\nEdit Log\n18/02/2015 formatting","February 27, 2014","true","31.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

However as you progress through the game it becomes increasingly clear it has failed on its execution. Here are the reasons why:\n- The controls are unintuitive, they give you hints early on to teach you about your various abilities, but as this is not the type of game you want to rush towards completion you could end up forgetting what you learned by the next time you play\n- The level design starting with level 4 is very bad, some spectra are super easy to reach, others are almost impossible to reach and rely on luck\n- The score and menu screen is a cluttered mess, I am sure no one ever looks at the score screen....\n- Whenever you unlock a new level, you are forced to play it and get a spectra before you can go back to the previous level and continue collecting spectra there\n- Whenever you get a spectra, you are forced to leave, view the score, and then go back in, this kills all immersion\n- It can be very tedious to navigate from one level to another. This wouldn't be too much of a problem if it weren't for the last two problems mentioned above\n- The music ranges between being really good and really bad.\n- This has the worst trailer out of all the games on steam, a title that used to belong to Escape goat 2's inane excuse for a trailer before they uploaded a normal one.","December 4, 2014","false","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

As it introduces you to something called "You-play-sloppy-and-you're-♥♥♥♥ed". It's a game that's easy to pick up and play, but extremely hard to master.\n\nThere's so much depth in Eden. To master the controls and rhythm of the controls is INSANELY tough. But once you figure it out (the gravity of the air, the pollen-physics and start listening to the rhythm of the music to become a better Eden-player), then YOU KNOW this is a top tier game.\n\nOne day you'll realize something and tell yourself "Holy ♥♥♥♥, I'm really good at this game - and I love the fact that this game punishes the ♥♥♥♥ out of me if I make a mistake. It's MY FAULT that I have to backtrack 15-20 minutes of perfection-gameplay" The previous statement might turn a lot of people off - and I completely understand that. Eden isn't a game for everyone, that's a fact. But if you really take your time with this game, then you're up for a masterpiece.","August 6, 2012","true","0.5"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Never actually finished it or anything, but loved the ♥♥♥♥ out of it. The music is awesome and in perfect synergy with the rest of the game.\n\nRecently picked this up for a very good price on Steam and been enjoying it again on PC. The Steam version includes the Encore DLC pack which is nice. Controls we're a bit weird for me at the beginning because I used to play the console version, but now I think it's actually easier with the mouse.\n\nI saw a lot of reviews / posts about this PC port is a fail, but I think they resolved these issues by now because I haven't experienced any issues so far.\n\nThe only thing I cannot say for sure about this game is wether or not multiplayer got ported too;\nOn the PS3 version you could hook up an extra controller and play with up to 3 friends, this was awesome, but is there anyone who can confirm it works on PC too? The "amount of players" indicator is showing in my garden, so I would assume so, but I can't test this at this point because Windows 10 preview doesn't play well with DualShock Controllers yet :P\n\n\nAnyway, if you love atmospheric no brainers with an awesome soundtrack, be sure to get this game!\n","May 31, 2015","true","13.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The more life you spread through the area, the more intense the music becomes, the higher your score gets. The interplay between light and sound in this game is simple, pure and effective, making what might otherwise be a monotonous game into a true gaming gem. The artful style of this game shines high above pixeljunk shooter's comparably infantile gameplay and the overly simple faced pixeljunk monsters. But the style alone does not make it great, the gameplay too is razor sharp. Simple controls allow for intuitive movement through the levels, using momentum and quick reflexes to reach speeds and heights neccesary to awaken the furthest reaches of each garden. The control of the game allows anyone to get into the game proper, and ride the difficulty curve as they please. This is a fairly low-stress game, as long as you keep an eye out for nasties and try not to fall all the way back down, you'll find very little pressure from the game to be fast, or efficient. There is a draining health bar, but suppliments are so common in-game it serves most purpose during combat. It does also create that special spark of drama, leaving a combat on low health and half-way up a garden, and urging you to find more dust quickly. The soundtrack is also one of the best I've heard in a good long while, featuring cool and relaxed electronic music, that provides enough rhythmic backbone without being overly intense or dramatic. The game as a whole is fairly clean from modern gaming cliche and is a welcome change from pretty much everything.\n\nSo, if you are looking to relax into a hypnotic electronic music arcade game art world from an arena of high-maintenence, major league, time-limited, bland and corporate gaming, Pixeljunk Eden is the game you need to buy.\n\n\n\n\nPS, it has world and friend ranked leaderboards if you didn't want to relax ;>","August 4, 2015","true","3.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/recommended/105800/","notsue","I'm Not Sue","http://steamcommunity.com/id/notsue/","465 products in account","A pretty good port of the PS3 game.  Some mechanics have been tweaked a little and if you've played the original that will be offputting.\n\nThis is an indie platformer with quite a bit more than average aesthetic theme added to it.  Maps are very large and there are numberous goals that must be reached within each map, each with their own special trait.  Some are mundane (boosting pads to leapfrog you over barricades) to the mindboggling (counter-clockwise rotational gravity), and the game does increase in difficulty a fair measure as stages progress.  The aesthetic is again, very strong here.  The gameplay may not be very innovative but the style is far from generic.\n\nThis comes with the DLC stages from the PS3 version already included, but not immediately accessible as the stage progressions have been altered slightly.  There are no online modes and offline coop has been removed, but it was an unuseful mode in my opinion as it was detractive rather than additive coop (more likely to hinder progression than assist).","January 27, 2013","true","4.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
