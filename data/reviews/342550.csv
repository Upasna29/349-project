I've been playing it on and off for a few months now. I would like to review the pros and cons . Keep in mind that this is still in early access , full release planned on April.\n\nPROS\n- The atmosphere is spot on and does not rely on cheap jumpscares\n- You'll get a weapon to defend yourself. It does not make the game any easier though :)\n- Combining elements of survival , stealth and quick thinking for success\n- Random generated levels , so it has replayability.\n\nCONS\n- The textures are kind of generic\n- Some animations are still buggy/jerky (should be fixed)\n- A few bugs with items (should be fixed upon release)\n\nOverall i can recommend this game for the price. The devs are responsive and listen to the community. Good job","March 7","true","24.9"," 60 of 83 people (72%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","72","60","83","3","1"

Solid foundation to build on, set on becoming great by the end of the journey.\n\nThe setting is the star of the show. Kowloon City is an excellent location to base a horror game around. If you watch documentaries on it, you'll know how crazy the construction was in the Walled City. A fact which surprisingly fits the procedurally generated maps element quite well. Justice is done to the setting, fits the atmosphere quite right in my opinion. With more variety potentially added down the development road, it can be one of the most interesting places to visit in a video game.\n\nThe presentation itself takes a little getting used to. The sound design is excellent but visually, the motion blur and flare effects can prove to be irksome initially. However, once past the barrier, you do start to appreciate it. It ties quite well with the gameplay elements and provides for a more immersive experience.\n\nThe gameplay is good, with a decent amount of variety already in the game. Primarily, the focus is on stealth; the objective of each level being to find the exit of the map. Though, you do have some leeway and can kill some of the monsters if you chose to. Be warned though, make too much noise and you'll awaken the Sleeper. You cannot hide or fight him once he's awakened. Your only chance is finding the exit, fast! A prospect which from my experience, was seldom met with success xD.\n\nA neat feature which I'm a huge fan of is the possibility of you losing your sanity. Light can be your best ally or your worst enemy. You have to use vision smartly. Flash your torch at the wrong creature and you will go crazy, leaving you disorientated, fast. Doom is almost certain in these moments. There are light switches to turn on and flares to throw (Can distract certain monsters), so you have a lot to think about each time you turn a corner!\n\nExploration is encouraged as you may find written notes that help build the picture of the tale that explains what caused the Walled City's doom. Plus, you'll have a chance of finding items or weapons that'll aid you in your ways. Though, with you being constanly being on edge due to fear, I rarely found myself taking the adventrous route xD. With the generated maps, each area of each run you play will hold something different! Things may turn out in your favour one time but completely screw you over in the next moment xD. Keeps the experience fresh every time.\n\nI will reiterate that I am playing this at early access launch. I did encounter a game bug or two, but generally nothing major which is worth mentioning. I'm confident the little nitpicks will be fixed as development goes on. Though, I would like to see a better options menu in the near future.\n\nTo sum it up, I can safely recommend this game to people interested by the premise. As of right now, it has good value attached to it. With more tweaks and additions coming in future updates, it has the potential to become a great product in the horror genre.","May 11, 2015","true","1.9"," 22 of 24 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","22","24","0","0"

It's horror, but you can play it inifinitely and it's gonna be different every time.  The procedural level generation you won't know what's around the corners - it could be monsters, helpful items or anything!  The levels always seem to look really differnt - they have some pre-made rooms but the randomized ones are really varied.\n\nOk so for a bit of a summary:\nPROS\n- Really different levels get generated\n- The game is really scary and atmospheric\n- It's so unique - I've never seen a combination of gameplay like this before\n- Lots of different ways to get through the game - you can choose\n- Awesome graphics and sounds for an indie game - sometimes it looks AAA!\n- Really stable for a Early Access game - it hardly crashes\n\nCONS\n- Some animations and things are a bit wonky\n- Small details need fixing like a few odd textures\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIt has some small things to improve but the dev said that they want feedback from us so it sounds really promising.  The whole game idea is awesome - I don't know why no one has done this before.\nSo overall 8/8!

The game will have AI improvements, procedural generated story, NPC interaction and more notes, endings and polish, so keep this in mind while reading/watching this review.\n\nSTORYThe game is heavily influenced by the Cthulhu Mythos by H.P. Lovecraft (which I love), and the monster design and notes scattered throughout remind you of them. However, there isn't much story to judge in the current state of the game: the developers said that they will tie the game more to Cthulhu and all that good stuff. So far, all we know is that you are in Kowloon Walled City before its destruction in the early 90s.\n\nGRAPHICSAs Unity games go, this looks good. The Motion Blur is quite aggressive, so I highly recommend turning it off after you start the game. The monster design is interesting, and the deeper you explore, the more varied they get. The environment has been crafted by Brian Bell, lightning director of movies like The Ring 2 and Life of Pi, and they look dark and eerie. There is currently little variety to some rooms, but it can be easily improved.\n\nGAMEPLAYThe goal of the game is to go from one point of the map to an elevator, to further descend into madness (see what I did there?). The game map is randomly-generated, and the best approach against the monsters is to stealth your way through by crouching and staying out of lit areas. As far as weapons go, so far I only found a handgun (M1911 to be precise), a shotgun, a wooden board and a metal pipe. The guns can be found in locked cases scattered around the map, and they can be opened by finding keys that are usually hidden inside a box or a cabinet.\nIf you cause a lot of noise, you will startle a Cthulhu-like monster: more noise you make, more angry he'll be, until he starts chasing you, and there is no way to kill him and hide from him because he is using a noclip cheat code.\nWhile the game is not scary, it does get really intense when you are carefully strafing near a monster, hoping that he doesn't feel you. You will also die really easily, making stealth and sprinting skills that you will develop really fast.\n\nCHALLENGEUnlike most modern horror games, the game brings back the survival horror that I like: you should avoid the monsters, but if you get seen you have at least some resources to fend them off for a while. You are also not overpowered: melee weapons break after ten hits, ammos are scarce and monsters are aplenty.\nUnfortunately, it got a little frustrating a couple of times: sometimes enemies would just spawn right in my face, or some times there were just too many of them in the way. Also, every time you die you will spawn back at the first level. These are just some annoyances that might turn off some gamers, but if you can look past them you will have a good time.\n\nSOUNDNothing to write home about: the sound of the monsters are generic, and the music is pretty weak. However, hearing your footsteps and the monsters' immerse you further into the game's dark corridors.\n\nREPLAYABILITYLots of good stuff here: there are currently five levels (more will be added) and 10 achievements, as well as the constantly different environments. You also have to take into account that it will be updated in the next few months.\n\nOverall, Phantasmal has a great start as far as Early Access games go, and the developers always answer even the most little of problems or questions. The atmosphere is good, the gameplay is solid. If you like this type of games, you should buy it.\n\nStory: n/a\nGraphics: 7.5\nGameplay: 8.5\nChallenge: 8.5\nSound: 6.5\nReplayability: 9\n\nENJOYMENT: 8\nFRUSTRATION: 7.5\nFollow me on Twitter: @nickygra97\nSubscribe to my channel\nLike on Facebook\n{LINK REMOVED}Check my official website\nJoin my Steam group","May 13, 2015","true","4.7"," 28 of 38 people (74%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","74","28","38","5","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeapotKing/recommended/342550/","TeapotKing","Teapot","http://steamcommunity.com/id/TeapotKing/","556 products in account","Early Access Review\n\nPlease note before reading that while I think this game has the potential to be enjoyable, it is currently flawed and I would not reccomend it in this state. This is supposed to be a horror game, and it is just not scary, at all. I'm not even a horror buff, but I can safely say that the Penumbra series is infinitely scarier than this.\n\nI absolutely love randomly generated exploration games, Reciever is one of my favourite games on steam, and I would love for this game to reach its full potential, but it's just not nearly there yet. I understand that it is an early access title, and that it is therefore unfinished, these are just my opinions on what needs to be improved.\n\n- While the environments and lighting look very nice on higher graphical settings, the animation, specifically that of the zombies, is VERY janky right now. Hopefully that can be improved upon\n\n- Spiders are (if you will forgive the pun) very buggy, on multiple occasions I saw spiders walk around a wall, that is to say, rotate on the spot through a wall, as if it were climbing to the other side, before dissapearing completely. Spiders also often span erratically and took a while to right themselves after spawning\n\n- Enemies just run straight at you the second they spot you, which often occurs through walls and doors. Their AI is just programmed to chase and attack, so every encounter ends up being a slugfest of you bashing them with a wooden plank until it breaks, running to find another wooden plank, and kiting them to the best of your ability (which is largely impossible because when you have to stop to hit enemies, they can easily outrun you). This means damage is inevitable and while they don't do very much of it, a group of them can kill you easily with no way of getting out of it besides still having pistol ammo to hand.\n\n- Health pills pickups refill very little health, getting them from a crate has absolutely no impact on your survivability because if too many enemies spawn at once you just die no matter how much health you have. Implementing something like the health pill system from left 4 dead whereby they give you a significant amount of health that ticks back down to where you were over time would be more useful than this.\n\n-There is a door near the very start of the game through which there is nothing, you can walk into it and fall into a bottomless abyss and die.\n\n- Enemies often spawned, appearing out of nowhere, while I was looking at them. They also had a tendency to crawl through doors, environmental objects, the walls, and eachother.\n\n- There's no feedback to tell you that you've hit something - it's just a case of swing away until the enemy (usually) falls through the floor and disappears.\n\nWhile this game is by no means terrible, the good amount of atmosphere created by the spooky sounds and the (actually quite nice!) environments is ruined by the zombies, whose animations and models look just plain silly, and the overly agressive AI turning every encounter into a 5v1 cage match.","November 2, 2015","false","1.0"," 43 of 65 people (66%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","66","43","65","2","5"

The game is set in the dark and foreboding Walled City of Kowloon, which was a twisted maze of buildings that was built without any planning, and came to have one of the densest populations on earth. It was eventually demolished by the government, no doubt to stop the dark cults of Cthulhu from corrupting the rest of Hong Kong :)\n\nThe game generates as you play, so no two maps are alike. This means you have to trust your senses to make your way around a map, and locate the enemy. Once you find them you can either run or try to kill them. The problem is that if you engage,  your sanity quickly slip away, and you're left a gibbering mess, who can't see straight, let alone aim your weapon.\n\nThis game is hard! I've made it past a few creatures so far, but no further. I'm not even sure what the goal of the game is yet. You get two clips of ammo to start and can scavenge for planks to use as weapons. You can take a few hits before you die, but if you're getting hit you're pretty much going to die badly. It's much better to be quite, turn your torch off, and hope they can't hear your heart hammering out of your chest.\n\nThe sound is atmospheric and the graphics are great. The game needs polish, but it's early days yet and I expect the developers are working hard to do just that. BTW, this game is made by Kiwi developers so if you can support them!\n\n“That is not dead which can eternal lie,\nAnd with strange aeons even death may die.”\n\n(“The Nameless City”, January 1921)","May 4, 2015","true","0.8"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","1"

Even though it has a lot of bugs, it is now my one of 10 favorite horror games of all time. Coming from me as a huge horror junkie, that is a HUGE praise.\n\nThe mixture of ultra creepy atmosphere, stealthy roguelike, unpredictable procedurally generated environment, and extremely scary creatures delivered a true and awesome survival horror experience.\n\nAfter each time I die, the floors are not same as the last one at all. Well, the rooms are similar but the pathways are always different which give a lot of repayability and unpredictable results. Amazing.\n\nThe creatures are extremely creepy, smart, and not to be messed with. At first, I was thinking, "I can plow through the game killing all the monsters and running. Yeah no problem." He he... Well no. Never happened. Each time I do that, I die immediately after 20 seconds. The monsters are very mean. The game requires a lot of stealth, careful planning with the guns (with very low ammo, use it wisely!), flares, keys, and a very small amount of health packs, and confidence. You will NOT want to see the huge monster right before you die ever again.\n\nMy most favorite part about the game is the atmosphere. It is really well done. It is so creepy and gives a lot of goosebumps. I can't spoil it any more. Buy it and find out!\n\nThe only problem I have with this game is the bugs. That's it. I highly expect the devs to iron out those bugs right before releasing this game officially. If they do that, this game is going to be one of the best survival horror games within the same tier as Outlast, Amnesia, Silent Hill, and System Shock 2.\n\n8.5 out of 10","June 29, 2015","true","15.2"," 16 of 18 people (89%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","89","16","18","0","1"

The atmosphere in the game is dark and foreboding. I enjoyed the dilapidation of the building with the leaking roofs, broken signs that are shorting out, and a very wide variety of other items. Stepping on one of the many bottles and garbage the litter the floor and having it break was very startling considering that to much noise will start to draw the attention of the unsavory types that lurk around.\n\nThe music was not over bearing but kicked up just when it needed to and the sound effects really added to the over all experience of the game. I also really enjoy that fact that its procedurally generated. Your experience will never be the same twice! Add in the variety of monstrous beings lurking around and your in for a great scare and a great time all around. If you are a fan of horror games or playing games that will leave an impression on you I highly recommend this game.\n\nThe game is still in early access so do expect to see some bugs, but they are not game breaking and in fact are very minor from what I've seen. After playing the game for a bit I found out something that I thought was very cool and spooky actually is a bug. Quite frankly I hope that one stays, as it adds to the mounting paranoia you feel as you play.","May 7, 2015","true","7.6"," 14 of 18 people (78%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","78","14","18","0","0"

It borrows liberally from other successful horror franchises (Outlast, Amnesia, and Silent Hill 2 come to mind) with the added twist of random level design. On one hand the game is, in theory, infinitely replayable. On the other hand, it lacks some of the tension and methodical pacing of more traditional horror games. It's tough to really call Phantasmal "horror" at all. Its more of a dark stealth experience with some unpredictable jump scares. Overall, there's a lot to like here--optional combat while stressing stealth, a cool risk/reward mechanic with light sources, and of course the unkillable tentacle monster. Unfortuantley, like many Early Access games, it's impossible for me to recommend Phantasmal in its current unfinished state. The lighting effects and motion blur are nauseating and the enemey AI and frequent glitches turn what should be a horror experience into something unintentionally comical at times.\n\nPhantasmal has a ton of potential and it's worth keeping an eye on to see how the game continues to evolve.\n\nFor gameplay footage and my first impressions, check out the video below:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/dCfDAukKjsI\n\n\n\n","May 4, 2015","false","2.5"," 22 of 33 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","22","33","0","3"

Also, I think we need a way to escape from multiple monsters, e.g. if they got fully distracted by the flares, so you could throw a flare to escape, even when they are attacking you. It's a great game overall, and I would rate it 8/10. -2 points because of lacking some features, but I hope more will be added soon.

It's fun throughout and hit the right part of the imagination so many games miss these days. It has a dingy street vibe accompanied by the neo-cyberpunk fit. Inspirations like Johnny The Homicidal Maniac and The Maxx come to mind. It's right down my alley and I give it a 9/10.\n\nTechnical Impressions: First playthrough I had a lot of tearing I couldn't figure out even with vsync on, so I was quite distracted by it and this game deserves to be played without any hindrances to quality. After digging around on the internet I found a fix for the tearing (Aero desktop settings have to be on in Windows7, weird but it got rid of all the tearing). There's not a lot of advanced settings for the graphics, but if you have a newer rig you shouldn't run into any slowing due to hardware.\n\nGameplay is fluid and easy to follow, level layouts are randomly generated to give it a good amount of replay value. Graphics and sound aren't the best, but this game unloads with a resounding style and the retro-fit of the quaility gives it a certain charm many developers don't understand. I don't know what to say, I'm going to cut it short but this game is an instant classic tickling many sub-genres in my mind and deserves to be on par with some of the most style-defining classics like Clive Barker's Undying.","May 24, 2015","true","5.3"," 9 of 11 people (82%) found this review helpful","82","9","11","0","2"

Phantasmal has a real Call of Cthulhu / Penumbra / Amnesia vibe to it, it's dark and mysterious, and generally better to opt for stealth over bravado. As the game is a brand-new early access release, there are still a few bugs to iron out. Sometimes the AI is either a bit too dumb or a bit too smart, doors randomly open and close, and the level of environmental interaction can leave a bit to be desired, however the atmosphere is spooky, the sound vs danger mechanic is nice, and the levels change on every playthrough, so you're never gaming a predefined path.\n\nProbably my only real disappointment so far is the lack of an options menu. I've been gaming for a very long time, and as such still use inverse-Y mouse. It's a throwback from 80's flight sims. Trying to play through with my vertical axis backwards is ... challenging ... but these are early access issues, and should by no means diminish the achievement of this small Kickstarter driven indie team. Inverse mouse players may wish to consider a controller.\n\nSpeaking of achievements, there are a bunch of them already available, with more to come.\n\nI believe that as Phantasmal approaches its official release, any concerns will melt away, along with your ability to maintain bowel control. It's a diamond in the rough, worth checking out, and if you're not into the whole early access thing, there are already a bunch of (highly entertaining) videos up on Youtube.\n\nSo, sneak away ye frightened gamers, and slay thee many roamers!

It doesn't use the overplayed "You have nothing to defend yourself" mechanic. It gives you some power through weapons, but they generally hinder you. The atmosphere is very spooky, the visual effects can be overbearing at times, but luckily they can be togged on and off if you tend to get motion sick. There is a bit of a learning curve to this game, which is good, it means you can get more bang for your buck.\n\nBugs\nthere are a few bugs, some of which were in my playthrough. I was pushed through a wall by a cupboard door, and the baddies could see the flair through the wall would walk directly towards it. The AI was hard to predict, but that may be because I am a newbie.\n\nOverall the game is very promising.

The levels are randomly generated each time you start over (which will be a LOT at first ... it's hard!), but it's executed with such care that each new layout feels like it's been lovingly hand crafted by a team of artists just to scare the pants off of you.\n\nThe game still has some rough corners that you'd expect from a pre-release. Once or twice I saw a monster walking into a wall. And sometimes it can be a bit difficult to gauge when you are hitting a monster in melee.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the game is punishing, so I wasn't able to see much of the story, though that looks promising (I like the Lovecraftian theme in a Kowloon City setting).\n\nThis certainly doesn't play like your typical FPS, and not your typical Survival Horror either. The pacing and tension in the game feel different from anything else I've played. Because of permadeath you have to be ALWAYS alert. But because of the randomly generated levels, you don't mind starting over when you do inevitably fail.\n\nSo, if being scared silly is your thing ... then this game is definitely worth checking out.","May 23, 2015","true","2.0"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Allahweh/recommended/342550/","Allahweh","Allahweh","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Allahweh/","299 products in account","Product received for free\n\nPhantasmal offers a pretty hooking premise: a procedural, roguelike horror game set in the famous Kowloon Walled City, just before its destruction in 1993. Grimey corridors, dark lighting, disgusting environments, and drug addicts galore, the setting alone sounds scary, even without any supernatural entities lurking about.\n\nThe game certainly delivers on the setting and the vibe of creepiness, thanks to good texture and lighting use as well as a great ambient soundtrack, but things start to unravel after you've experienced a couple runs and realize that the random generation can become predictable and your journey becomes more marred by bugs than by dangerous creatures.\n\nThe story pits you as a private investigator heading into the walled city to find your missing aunt Jackie, who ran a heroin clinic there but has not been seen in two weeks, and once you leave the starting area, each subsequent "floor" is randomly generated. Death leads to you starting all over again, with the catch being you can keep whatever money you found to use at the merchant (named Egg Chin) who sells various equipment/ammo and stat upgrades. None of the purchases are cheap, by the way, with an initial price of $50 for a 10% boost to a given stat, and $50 took me two runs to build up. Subsequent upgrades range from $150 to as high as $400, and it's hard for me to imagine someone pressing on long enough to build up that money.\n\nEnemies clip the environments and some have low-tier animation, the menus are very bugged (settings often reset for me, which was a big annoyance), and the controls often feel very sluggish. Despite the game being about stealth, I had to fight my way out of several bad situations, and that felt a bit counterintuitive. Additionally, the game had some performance problems too, and whether running as high as 4K or down at 720p, I had the same framerate (yikes!).\n\nTo me, the game feels unfinished. I feel like if more work went into it, there's something more here for the game, but in its current form, I just don't think it's worth the asking price. If you catch it at a deep discount or as part of a bundle though, give it a try!\n\nSo, despite its creepy environment and some good jump scares, overall this game just didn't deliver fully. On a scale from 0 to 10, where 5 is "average," this game rates as:\n\n=====================================\nMEH...... 4 / 10\n=====================================\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_-KB1BMy9k\n(Gameplay sample at 1080p)","May 31","false","1.8"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Well, look elsewhere cuz that isn't what this game is about.\n\nI came into this game with little to no understanding of what it was or how to play it (or any roguelike game for that matter). For the first couple hours, I heartfully denied any stealth element of the game, running about willy-nilly, smashing junkies with boards and popping Amnesia monsters with my faithful sidearm. And I died. A. Lot. Doesn't help that I believe that games should be enjoyed with a cold beer (or 5), and I played and I died and I played and I died. And I hated it.\n\nI went through to double-check this, almost every negative review has less than 2 hours of gameplay and had I written this review in the same amount of time, I would have added my voice to theirs, decrying the buggy gameplay and the long meandering levels. When you get further than you ever have and a tidal wave of spiders have you swinging futilely like a child at a piñata party until you collapse, defeated, there is an instant of rage where you want to cast the game down the darkest hole... Then you reload and try again.\n\nEven while this game drove me crazy, I came to realize that the real problem I was having was a lack of understanding. Fellow Youtubers will find that this is not an easy game to film, as the random generation means you do not know when the action is coming and if you play this without patience, you will only get so far. So I improved. I evolved. On Day One, I was a stumbling fool, with all the stealth of a water buffalo wearing tap shoes. By Day 8, I was a ninja, creeping through every room and quietly collecting goods, distracting monsters with a well-timed flare, smacking flaming, floating heads out of the air with ease, and those spiders? I went John Goodman on them ("Arachnophobia" reference, for those under 30).\n\nI dodged monsters and grabbed coins, buying (very expensive) upgrades, and as I slowed my own pace, I allowed the atmosphere to finally get to me. Though you see the same rooms often, this also helps you learn them and know just where to go to get collectibles in a hurry, and the dark setting and ambient sounds through my headphones began to unnerve me, until I would hear the distant beep-beep-beep that signified the end of the level was just a little further. Though I have many, many games to play, I was finding myself coming back to Phantasmal to push myself harder, to get a little further, and I was rewarded for it. Everything is random, so after playing the game for a week, when a new scare occurred, it took me completely by surprise because I thought I had already seen everything, and I soon realized how wrong I was.\n\nWhen I finally completed the first chapter, I was elated, then confused, as I thought I was going to have to start back at the beginning and again, I had an urge to say "That's it, no more, I've paid my dues, dammit!" And then I began again. With all the practice during my early days of hardcore failing, the second chapter turned out to have its own differences, and I have a feeling there are some new enemies I have yet to face, new strategies to formulate, and more detail to a story that I at first scoffed at, but over time, realized might be more intriguing than I first thought. I wasn’t even filming as I breezed through the second chapter, and when things took a new turn, I was scrambling to set up equipment and I learned again not to underestimate this game.\n\nAs a closing thought, this game is a challenge. While some bugs drive me crazy, there is an active community discussion board that includes personable developers LISTENING to their players, giving guidance and seeking to improve where they can. This is a game that charms over time; don't be one of those gamers that tries to play just enough to get in a flippant review. The game's unforgiving perma-death adds tension and makes survival meaningful, and reminded me of the old times in videogames where there was no Quick Save, no easy mode; you didn't buy games for a quick experience, they were meant to challenge you for weeks, as this one did. If you're willing to put some time into a game, take failures as learning experiences, and tolerate some (occasionally exceedingly comical) bugs, all surrounded by a dark, brooding atmosphere, give Phantasmal a try.\n\nYou can watch my own personal journey from "game hater" to "gaming harder," monster-bait oaf to flare-slingin', sneakity-sneak ninja yourself at Beard+Beer Gaming. Laugh at my idiocy in the first few episodes, and witness my learning curve get its swerve by Ep 4 or 5, then test yourself.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gzDY2_cP9E8","May 29","true","17.6"," 1 person found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","0","1","1","0","0"

Out of everyone at the convention, I was the only person able to beat all the levels available at the time. despite this, it took be the better portions of both days for me to achieve that. With this latest version, i have yet to even get past the second level. Eyemobi have made a really great horror game, that plays on your Fight or Flight response, every second you spend in the game. Additionally, This game has become the highest rated Horror Game to come from a New Zealand based developer, which, as a New Zealander, is something that just makes you want to love the game anyway.\n\nAlso. Spiders. Its always the Spiders.\n\nOFFICIAL RELEASE UPDATE:\n\nA whole lot harder, a whole lot scarier. The developers have made great strides in the quality of their game over the past year. Game has more options, animation is much smoother, and the random level generation algorithms are no longer occasionally sticking me in the walls. There are so many poor quality survivial horror games that have come out the past few years, but i can say with all honesty that this is one of the best the genre has to offer.","August 23, 2015","true","0.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

When i play any other horror game i can spot the enemy just with the soundthey make  which gives you time to react well not this game.

I was bored, and itching for something different. I was scrolling down the list of games reading the descriptions and i read this one. The words Lovecraft really caught my eye so I said....screw it, why not. So I watched the first trailer in the showcase menu. My first thought was....."Silent Hill based?" I may be wrong but definitley seemed closely related which also got my attention.\n\nWhen entering the game after you adjust your visuals etc etc youll notice many effects, dust effects and lighting effects. I liked this especially in horror games. It gives off a dirty feel when you are wandering and dust is everywhere. I never played Rougue Like before so you can imagine my horror and distarught when i loaded a second go at it only to NOT be in the same area!!! That was incredibly shocking and an entire 180 for me but i liked it.\n\nThe Devs typically respond to posts in 2-3 hours, maybe less. Currently playing at 1920x1080 at more than 60 fps, IMO the game is quite stable! Once support for 4k gamers like me come out for 3840x2160, I can only imagine the craziness thatll come with it.

It ran easily. I liked the horror theme real City of Riyat from HP Lovecraft vibe going for it.\n\nI liked the Stalkers with their hands over their eyes and massive tongues reaching out to you. The spiders didnt run briliantly and could run in vertical square runb around a room making it nearly impossible tohit them with a plank or gun fire.\n\nI played it 13th January 2016 and man have they changed it.\n\nThe positives.\n-More enmeys now has the addicts and the fat addicts.\n-A short story at the beginning to explain why are player is in this situation.\nAn enemy that seems to be a pair of red eyes then spawns in as an immatiated dark brown skeletal figure with long claws. Lets call him Skeletor\n-An NPC trader. Oddly he is at the top of the map and once you go down an eeveator you cant go back....not sure how you are meant to get coin and go back to him but hey...\n\nThe negatives\n-Enemys randomly dissapear making me wonder is that enemy supposed to be an illusion or is that just glitchy death animations.\n-The lighting was poor before but now it seems you either have dark hallways and rooms or a fleurescent bulb constantly shining from above with this annoying background hum.\n- I shot one enemy and he turned invisibe and was still able to attack me.\n- I think the devloper needs to work on maybe giving the player a knife or something to fend off enemys because once your ammo is goine and plank falls apart you cant do alot except run then die or stay put and die.\n-I shot Skerletor (see the positives) and when I shot him he got crushed from a 6 ft 6 inch monster into a 6 inch by 13 inch accross rag doll spinning around the room.... then when he touched me he pushed me...NO Blew me through the walls of the map into.... a void I suppose it is? And I promptly die.\n\nThe idea for this game is still good but............little bit more explanation maybe even a youtube video on different enemy types and explanation as what the hell is going on.\n\nI'm still giving it a thumbs up because this is an Indie devloper thats still clearly interested in adding to the game. More than I can say for AAA games and the idea is fairly unique. I love the sleeper Idea but I havent survived long enough to see it in action. So what I am saying is if you are about to buy this game dont be surprised if your charchter startes getting atatcked by invisible enemys.

I can hide in pitch black with my flashlight off and they still see and attack me. The radius they walk around is to short to outmanuver them as they only move a few meters back and forth forcing you to attack them and get attention from enemys around. The firecrackers seems not to work at all. I tried many times to distract the enemy and they just ignore them.\nFor a roguelike game this is just not optimized and fun to play.

Those were some really good screenshots and reviews.\n\nBut then came things that weren't really covered a whole lot in my sources. There's alot of lag even at the lowest setting, and the brightness/gamma settings seem to be a little off. I set it at the recommended levels, but it became pitch dark when I did such that I turned them halfway to the top. Only then can I play the game.\n\nOtherwise, killing poor chem addicts and impoverished women don't really scare me a whole lot.\n\nBut good effort here, it just needs a lot of polish. I'm hesitant to recommend it, but I will, on the basis that a customer's investment in this game will likely pay off.","April 16","true","1.1"," 2 of 7 people (29%) found this review helpful","29","2","7","0","0"

Sure, everything is randomly generated, but if the game is unpolished and not fun to play then what is the point.  Using weapons has no weight behind them.  Also, the framerate is very inconsistent.  You can usually tell where all the monsters are even in the dark simply by looking in one direction and watching the framerate drop to 25.\n\nGive this title some time.

Finally, I decided to give the game a shot anyway. Also has some major optimization issues and this is the FULL RELEASE of the game. This game should obviously still be in Early Access because it feels entirely unfinished. This game doesn't even come close to matching the quality or gameplay promised by the store page.

Even on the lowest setting the game scrapes along  at the pace of a glacier, and your charecter itself can stuck on just about any piece of the thosands of pieces of garbage lying everywhere meaning that movement is a crapshoot. There are weapons scattered everywhere so you never have any sense of terror or dread at the scarcity of your resources. Stealth is a bloody joke as some enemies can't see five feet in front of their face and others can detect you a mile away.\n\nDo not let the trailer fool you either. There is no sense of tensity or suspense at all as enemies are swarming throughout the level, making an ecounter an inevitablity not a shock. Furthermore it seems that the game pretty much copy and pasted Amnesia's sanity system, meaning the only thing sanity does it whether or not you can see straight or not. Messing with the focus is not scary Phantasmal, just annoying! No glitch effects are not scary either.\n\nThe graphics are none to impressive either and the animations do not feel smooth at all, regardless of the frame rate. The menu literally looks like somebody plastered a school notebook to a chinese take-out menu.\n\nI wanted to like this game, I  really did but I cannot overlook this piece of 廢物","April 19","false","0.9"," 1 of 8 people (13%) found this review helpful","13","1","8","0","1"

For the sake of the developers, here's why:\nWhat am I looking for? My aunt? I think it's safe to assume she's dead pretty soon after meeting the first nonhumans.\nWhy am I in the starting room? How did I get there? Why are the elevators glowing green inside? With a magical symbol? This is supposed to be Kowloon? I'd take another look at my reference pictures.\n\nBack to the nonhumans. If your gun is out of bullets and your melee weapon broken, then what?\nYou remove all combat interaction? Strange choice, to remove half of the players ability to interact with the game.\n\nAnd where do the enemies come from? Some seemed to appear from the ground and some were stuck in environment details. How do they attack? By touching you lightly with their forehead? All the first enemies look the same and are dull, dull, dull. They are not intimidating at all, and the second type of enemy is also boring, and there should be more stages of mutation if that's what the junkies are mutating into.\n\nI like that the GUI is fairly clean, but it doesn't convey much besides how much ammo is left. I know it's supposed to, but it doesn't work very well.\n\nThe game is not scary at all, only annoying.\nThis game is a linear labyrinth where the only interesting thing about it is the shader.

I'm going to review this thing as if it was a full release, because Early Access is no excuse to rate a game better, than you would if it were fully released. This is only the mature thing to do as EA titles are getting abandoned everyday, I will update my review as the game progresses through development.\n\nPros:\n- Stealth is a great tactic to use\n- You can kill the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s\n- It's procedurally generated, so each playthrough is different\n- It's a creepy atmosphere\n- A few jumpscares got me good\n\nCons:\n- The AI is buggy\n- The graphics aren't the greatest\n- The game likes to crash, alt-tabbing will almost surely crash the game.\n\nShould you get this game? If you really like horror games, then yes this game may suit you; however, at this current state the game is in I CANNOT recommend it to the average consumer.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVJmPk-gSrs","April 30, 2015","false","0.2"," 15 of 41 people (37%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","37","15","41","0","5"

For example, there is no options menu on the menu screen...you'll have to go in-game to lower or mute the volume, then quit back to the menu.  When I did that, the "How to Play" menu glitched and showed the wrong information (as seen in my video below).  The animations (weapons and enemy movement) are not very smooth...Killing Floor 2 is a fine example of a game that does this right.  The atmosphere is indeed creepy at times, but I just didn't enjoy my experience enough to warrant a recommendation...for now.  I'm not saying YOU won't, I'm simply saying that I didn't.  "Phantasmal", in my opinion, needs more time to cook in order for it to be enjoyable.
