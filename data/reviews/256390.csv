Graphics for PC suck, jagged edges everywhere. Audio is terrible. You can't slide the rear into corners anymore (backing it in), Random highsides with TCS on full. AI still seem to always go faster than you mid corner and will ram you from behind at any chance. Regret purchasing this and that makes me seriously sad. Thumbs down on this one.","June 20, 2014","false","3.9"," 187 of 240 people (78%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","78","187","240","3","1"

If you can get past that then please feel free to read further.\n\n\nThe game is 'good' and probably the best bike racing simulator I've played, and as a biker I buy them all. The physics engine is generally pretty decent, the bikes themselves are faithfully modelled and of course its nice to have the Dorna permissions to include the full roster of teams and rides. But that's it.\n\n\nThe game is built on a clearly dated engine that has reached, if not passed its end of life cycle. I'm playing on a fairly competent machine, i7, 16Gb, GTX670, SSD and the game performs poorly with frequent stuttering. Garage scenes are particularly ugly with massive screen tearing and corruption when selecting the bike to confirm which developments to complete. Very poor.\n\n\nRacing is generally good. There's a decent sense of speed and simulation going on though the sound of the bikes is pretty off. AI is generally perfunctory at best. They ride and do what they're supposed to do though have no real character; you can certainly tell that it is algorithm riding the bikes.\n\n\nHowever the biggest negative is the startling fact that this is a poorly optimised console port and Milestone hasn't done anything to even attempt to hide this fact: No graphics options, poorly optimised UX (for PC), No way to Quit to desktop(!), no way to save custom controller configurations...\n\n\nMilestone don't tend to patch their games. I don't expect any of these issues to be addressed.\n\n\nEnd of the day I waited until the game was on sale before buying as I'm fully aware of Milestone's track record and history with respect to their games and support there on in. I paid GBP 14.99 and feel that I have a fair value for money at that price proposition.\n\n\nSummary; it is a 'good game' for an unambitious console port with the usual trappings of what that entails. Don't buy at full price!\n","October 23, 2014","false","11.0"," 57 of 65 people (88%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","88","57","65","0","0"

The sound is horrible. The backfire on the bikes sound like someone beating on a drum. Really guys, a drum beat for the backfire sound. lol. Crashes also sounds like someone beating on some metal object. Just horrible sounds. Now, for some reason, everytime i start the game up, i have to redo my controller settings. I don't understand why this happens but its not saving my controller settings. Pitiful!!! One other note, two people so far have told me that the game won't even start up. Go figure. Im not surprised at all with this games bugs. I anticapated the bugs in this game as a result of the '13 bugs but to make this game worse, im not getting this. I think the rights to this game should be given to some other gaming company to produce and that could do a better job at this, maybe EA Sports just to name one. This is really pathetic. Also, the only way i can exit the game is to force close with the Task manager and because of that, i lost my progress. Nice. All that work i did lost.  lol. Oh, and  i almost forgot, im missing some of the Moto2/3 bikes due to DLC. I just bought the season pass DLC thinking i would get the bikes i was missing. Nope, don't have them.

I decided to pick up the PC version so that I could let the game stretch its legs a bit with the extra power of my computer.\n\nUnfortunately the PC version is very obviously playing second fiddle to the console version.  The graphics options are extremely limited (extra fx and hi res textures) though you do get to change the refresh rate and vsync.  The graphics while in the garage seem a bit strange, as if they are being rendered at a lower resolution than the 1080p which the main game runs at, and the textures in the garage are also very low resolution and blurry.\n\nThere are other oddities, such as cut scenes and replays being locked to 30fps.  Being able to exit the game to the desktop is glitchy, sometimes you get the option to do it and other times you have to kill the game from the task manager.  That's a pretty obvious issue that should never have been allowed through the QA process.\n\nI am able to unlock vsync and run the game approaching 120fps but it's very stuttery, the only way to get the game to run smoothly for me is to run it at 60hz with full vsync and this seems to remove most of the problems.\n\nThankfully, the actual game itself is great, the racing is fast and furious and the handling superb.\n\nIn essence, it's a great game but a poor PC port, there aren't even any options for AA.\n\nDespite the reservations I have about MotoGP 14 on the PC,  I'm still thoroughly enjoying it as the base game itself is excellent and the Career mode is really fun this time around.\n\nWhether the game is for you or not depends on how you feel about slightly shoddy console ports.....","June 24, 2014","true","1.5"," 62 of 90 people (69%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","69","62","90","0","3"

However, the improvements required were obvious and should have been easy for Milestone to fix.  Well, they didn't - in fact, they've made it worse.  Much, much worse.\n\nThere are virtually no graphics quality settings whatsoever and no AA control at all.  In-game graphics are a bizarre mixture of out-of-focus fuzziness for when in the pit, to glossy realism on the podium, to a jagged mess (due to no AA) on the track.  Bike control hasn't improved, still no proper XB360 controller for PC, exiting the game currently requires CTRL+ALT+DEL and Task Manager, tyre grip still isn't modelled, bike setup is still childishly pointless because it does so little.  And now it's riddled with DLC.\n\nI'm a big fan of MotoGP but how on Earth Dorna Sports can let such a potentially fantastic license be ruined by such inept software development is beyond me.  Milestone claim to have fully revamped the game engine but the evidence for this is painfully absent.\n\nDon't waste your money on this game.","June 27, 2014","false","20.6"," 20 of 27 people (74%) found this review helpful","74","20","27","0","4"

There is currently no way to adjust the AA, shadows, fog, etc. There also are very apparent bugs present…for example, once in career mode you cannot exit to the desktop without force quitting with the task manager. There is no way to save controller settings. The frame rate slows down and gets choppy and I even have the 2 settings turned off (AFX and High Res textures) where with MotoGP 13 i have everything set to on and high without the slightest hit to framerate.\n\nThis iteration feels rushed and thus far a single V1.1 patch has not been released since the game came out in June of 2014. If the patch comes out and the improvements are made then I will change my stance. I want to love this game as MotoGP is a passion of mine.

We've been waiting for a patch to fix many bugs, major and minor, since June, and so far we still have a game working at 75%.\n\nThe community support from Milestone has been terrible since the launch of this game. Communication has never been their strong point for titles like MotoGP, WRC, etc, which I suppose is equally as bad as their efforts to release games which are worthy of being retail releases.\n\nPerhaps one of the biggest gripes I have is the limited video options you get with this title. As per usual in a Milestone game, you cannot change the video settings in-game; the launcher is where you have to make your changes, and once you're in-game, that's it. Not only that, but the options you actually get to choose from are dire, and the game, even when bumped up to the highest settings, looks tacky for a PC game. I wouldn't consider myself that much of a graphics snob, but there's a line you cannot go back over once we're into a new generation.\n\nThere's a good game in here somewhere, but it's surrounded by problems, from stupid to complex. Therefore, I won't be recommending this game, neither will I be recommending any Milestone product until they pull their finger out to improve 1) the quality of their games for release, and 2) their general customer support.","October 23, 2014","false","19.6"," 12 of 18 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","12","18","0","0"

It's a shame it's really the only game in town.  Let me say up front that I really do like this game.  That said I do have my fair share of gripes with it.  It seems to perform better than 2013, but for a "last gen" game, there really is no excuse for the occasional frame drops I get.\n\nAlso, the AI is very weak, seems like a step back from last year, which wasn't great.  The AI is so linear with no personality whatsoever and are basically on rails.  Come to think of it, I am almost a season in and have not seen a single crash (that didn't involve me).\n\nAlso the difficulty is basically useless.  I want to win, but I like a challenge so, like last year, I turn it down a little until I get in the groove and then crank it back up.  However, even on medium difficulty I have issues, but it's more the inconsistency of the AI.  I can go out blind folded on Free Practice, Qualifying, and Warm Up and set the pole by 2 seconds, but on race day, certain tracks, the AI will then go out and out lap you by 3-4 seconds!  Also, I have noticed if the AI is in front of you, they are very difficult, but if and when you manage to get past them, magically they suck horribly and will fall far behind you, whereas if you do not get the position back quickly, they will continue to pull from you and there is little to be done about it.\n\nThe AI also appears to be bound by a different, more lenient set of physics laws as well, as they are able to hold corner speed that you cannot dream of in general.  Hold tight lines and accelerating faster at full lean, while you're picking the bike up and cannot keep up.  On that same note though some tracks with open fast corners, they always are extremely slow which allows you to blow by them.\n\nAnyways, even though this review must sound highly negative, I do enjoy the game, and it offers plenty of fun to be had, and I will continue to keep playing and getting better.\n\nSide note: does anyone play this online as I can never seem to find any active lobbies?","August 21, 2014","true","40.3"," 5 of 8 people (63%) found this review helpful","63","5","8","0","0"

All are Milestone titles. The SBK series was extremely well polished, great sims, included lots of features, and I enjoyed them thoroughly. The Motogp series, OTOH, has been a bit of a disappointment.\n\nMotogp 13 doesn't include SBK standard features such as telemetry data and ghost in time attack mode. Motogp 14 is more of the same. Also, in the SBK series, you had to be extremely careful not to go off track because you'd lose traction if you were on the throttle or brake in anything but an upright position. In Motogp 13, you can pin the throttle while fully leaned over off-track and you'd never have to worry about losing traction. Motogp 14 is more of the same.\n\nMotogp 13 had a few bugs but the main one that affected me was the online play. Connectivity through Raknet was horrible. Motogp 14 chose to go with Raknet again so I'm not holding my breath when it comes to multiplayer. Another bug in Motogp 13 was that enabling vsync in-game would cause choppy frame rates. Motogp 14 again has issues with choppy frame rates, remedied somewhat through config.ini modifications, but looks like a step backward compared to Motogp 13. While the replay mode in Motogp 14 looks stunning, in game is a different matter as the lack of anti-aliasing makes for blocky imagery that looks like low-res textures have been upscaled.\n\nAnother disappointment is the inclusion of more bugs. The controller settings are not saved, forcing you to reinput your settings each time you restart the game. Also, if you play the career mode, the quit option is not accessible, forcing you to use CTRL ALT DEL to quit the game.\n\nThat being said, I really enjoyed the helmet cam view in Motogp 13, and thankfully Motogp 14's helmet cam retains the same enjoyment. Motogp 14 has also tweaked the physics, limiting your ability to the slide and brake during cornering bringing about a less arcadish experience.\n\nMotogp 13 felt like a beta version that was sold to consumers. Motogp 14 feels like more of the same but with even more bugs and graphical issues. A recurring theme of recent Milestone titles appears to be to release untested console ports that force consumers to wait for patches that may never come. While I can find enjoyment in the game, after consecutive releases that have been full of bugs, I've lost faith that future releases from Milestone would be any different. I'd love to see another developer take a shot at Motogp.\n\nPurchase at your own risk.","July 3, 2014","false","140.2"," 8 of 15 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","8","15","0","0"

You know how useful those reviews are, you know, the ones from kiddies that don't know how to ride a motorcycle in the first place, or don't have the funds to buy 14 so thats why they like MotoGP2013 better? Don't listen to Steam Reviews, Youtube gameplay or check out twitch to see how good a game is before you write it off. You are missing out if you don't and are into motorcycle racing, this is a great game with aggressive challenges. It's too real for everyone else. You need a gaming computer to play it, otherwise stop complaining about choppy graphics and stuttering gameplay. It runs perfectly smooth on my machine, if you have video card issues, fix it and stop leaving bad reviews because you'd rather buy another game for your computer rather than upgrading it so you can actually play the new game how it's supposed to be played.

Truly awful.\n\nIf you already have MotoGP 13, DO NOT BUY 14. It's the same game, it's just been given some new menu's, a few crappy new modes, and updated bike liveries. Everything else is practically identical to MotoGP 13. How it took Milestone a year just to do a few crappy updates is beyond me. Lets do a little breakdown...\n\nThe graphics: Awful, worse than '13 and there's even less options.\nThe UI: Where the hell is the quit button? Non existant. To quit it's CTRL+ALT+DEL.\nThe handling: No different from '13.\nThe AI: Still riding as if you aren't on circuit with them.\nThe biggest problem: The game stutters like crazy. I'm running it on an i7 4770K + GTX 770 OC, yet it's as if every 3 seconds or so it drops to about 15FPS for a few moments, then gets back to normal for 3 seconds, then repeats. This makes it just horrible on the eyes. It's even more obvious in the menu's.\n\nMy score: 2/10\n\nIf you really want a MotoGP game, buy '13 instead, '14 will make you feel desperately ripped off.

Very demanding controls but once you learn how to handle the powerful bikes you can go much faster without TCS. The graphics are decent, no clipping, jagged edges, etc on my machine running it at full settings. However the game is plauged by several technical bugs that have no business being in a finished game. The control schemes do not save after exiting the game so if you change the controls you have to do so again every time you start the game up or they revert back to default. Also the game has no exit button. Sometimes alt + F4 works but sometimes you get stuck with having to force close the game with the task manager. I personally have never been able to connect to the online portion of the game even for uploading race times. The game has a lot of potential but really falls short and it feels like the developer just rushed it out with little to no testing. Very dissapointing after spening $40 on the game. With that said, avid moto gp fans will enjoy the authenticity and the actual racing mechanics but the game has very little depth to keep you interested after a season or two. I can't honestly recommend this game to anyone other than die hard racing fans who might at least get some enjoyment out of it.","October 10, 2014","false","26.7"," 3 of 7 people (43%) found this review helpful","43","3","7","0","0"

Career mode will take you a good while so you have some plenty of hours of entertainment.","June 24, 2015","true","25.3"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Even if at the full price its decent content for the money.\n\nI don't see a way to properly replicate the motorcycle environment in your game room like I can a car sim. So as far as physics I cant rate this game because I am using a controller, and I don't have a sim bike.\n\nIts pretty easy to play with a controller considering I don't play moto style games much. I got 1st every race so far at pro difficulty. I guess that means the AI sucks. But a nice easy game is fun to have every once in a while.\nI am not a motorcycle guy. I just wanted a motorcycle game, and it was on sale.\n\n\nAfter all the negative feedback I was expecting a lot worse, but at least I did not expect much. Its a milestone game, enough said there.\n\nOne con is the control mapping page say button number rather than whether it is a-b-y-x Lb-Rb-Lt-Rt. In the game its tells you, but in the mappings it dont. I wanted to know what button was back brake so I can slide the turns. I figured it out, after a bit of work.\n\nMoto15 is coming out so this will probably go on sale again.\n\nIts runs perfect at max settings on my old out dated PC at 1920x1080 at about 120 to 260 fps mostly at 180.\nGigabyte EP45T-UD3P\nIntel QX9650\n16GB DDR3 PC3-12800 Ram\nGigabyte Windforce HD7970 3GB 384bit AMD Graphics card\nIntel 240GB SSD drive\n","May 14, 2015","true","5.0"," 3 of 8 people (38%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","38","3","8","2","0"

This Game is now playable online with some problems.\n\n1. AI glitch too much so for people playing career mode you might have some issues and for online racings just dont use them hands down. NO AI online.\n\n2.Chat status button is still fixed to right joystick click. why...modded my controller and removed the pins for the L3 button. SAme thing i did to my ps3 controller.\n\nother then that its reallly fun!!! I played quite a few online races today. Each race was competitive AND NO LAG YAY!!! [took six months though]\n\nGo buy it!! its fun\n\n\nTHIS GAME WAS RELEASED UNFINISHED. SERIOUSLY PS3 VERSION SUCKS AND THE PC? EVEN WORSE! IT JUST GLITCHES TWITCHS AND FREAKS OUT A LOT FASTER THEN THE CONSOLE VERSIONS. SERIOUSLY IVE HAD IT WITH THIS GAME. IT DOESNT MATTTER WHO YOU ARE YOU CANT DENY THIS GAME WAS NOT FINISHED AND IS NOT PLAYABLE ONLINE...PERIOD i WANT MY MONEY BACK..\n\namd FX3820 EIGHT CORE 3.5 8GBDDR3  R9 2702GB\n\nHERES MY LIST OF EVERY SINGLE THING THAT IS WRONG WITH THIS GAME...\n\n1.NO RIDER CUSTOMIZING. NOTHING\n2.NO REAL TRAINING COURSE\n3.TO MANY LOADING SCREENS/MAINLY A PS3 ISSUE LOADING TIMES ARE FAST FOR PC\n4.NO HOST MIGIRATION OR ABILITY TO CHANGE LOBBY SETTINGS. HOST HAS TO LEAVE TO CHANGE SETTING AND LOBBY WILL DROP.\n5.PC LOBBIES ALWAYS START YOU IN STANDARD PHYSICS.....\n6.PC/PS3 CANT CHANGE CHAT STATUS BUTTON. THIS IS BY FAR THE BIGGEST PLAW IN MOTOGP FOR THE PS3 AND SOMEHOW XBOX 360 CONTROLLERS ON THE PC. PS3 CONTROLLERS ACT FUNNY, BUT WORK SOMETIMES THEN NOT. I WANT TO MEET THE GUY WHO SAID THAT WAS A GREAT IDEA. LOCK THE CHAT STATUS BUTTON ON THE PS3 AND SOMEHOW I CANT CHANGE IT WITH THE 360 CONTROLLER ON THE PC?\n7.AI SLOW EXCEPT IN CAREER MODE UNTIL LATELY....\n8.GAME DROPS PLAYERS FROM LOBBY. EITHER YOU, SOMEONE ELSE OR THE WHOLE LOBBY. SO FAR PC ITS HAPPEN A FEW TIMES AND THE PS3 50% I SAY 50% OF GAMES WE START DROP PLAYER/PLAYERS FROM LOBBY. OVER HALF THE GAMES DROP MAKING THIS GAME UNPLAYABLE ON THE PS3 AND NOW THE PC...\n9.PEOPLE LAG, GLITCH, JUMP, FLY YOU NAME IT, ITS PATHETIC ON EVERY CONSOLE AND PC. ITS JUST HORRRIBLE. IT JUST GLITCHES A LOT FASTER ON THE PC. LIKE ITS ABLE TO PROCESS THE CODE THATS BROKEN FASTER THUS DISPLAYING THE HORRIBLE ENGINE PHYSICS FASTER. FOLLOW ME? CANT PLAY ONLINE SO SAD\n10.NOTHING TO DO OFFLINE LIKE TAKE A TRAINING COURSE OR TO SOME CHALLAENGES. THE MAKE YOU DO THIS "REAL TIME EVENT" THATS JUST YOU RACING CRAPPY AI FOR LIKE 5 LAPS LOL. BUT I WILL SAY GRAND PRIX MODE HAS A 30 LAP SETTING AND YOU CAN SAVE IN BETWEEN WEEKENDS JUST INCASE YOU GOTTA GO.\n11.AUDIO CRAP. THATS A NICE BAND NAME\n12. DID I MENTION YOU CANT PLAY THIS GAME ONLINE WHICH IS WHY A LOT OF PEOPLE BUY IT. IT DESERVES A SECOND MENTION\n13.SPEAKING OF 13, THAT WAS A GREAT GAME. BUT I BOUGHT IT 6 MONTHS AFTER IT WAS RELEASED MAYBE AN UPDATE CAME THREW FOR IT.\n14. EMAILS PROMISING AN UPDATE AND FACEBOOK POST OF AN UPDATE THAT DIDNT FIX ANY ONLINE ISSUES....\n\nI WANT MY MONEY BACK. I LOVE MOTOGP GAMES BUT IM SORRY DONT BUY THIS. UNLESS YOURE A DIE HARD MOTOGP AND WANT TO THREW MONEY INTO SOMEONES POCKET FOR A UNFINISHED GAME GO AHEAD.\n\nNOV 4TH THE SO CALLED USA RELEASE DATE IS THE ONLY HOPE LEFT FOR THIS GAME....I DONT SEE A BRIGHT FUTURE MILESTONE IS ALREADY PRODUCING A NEW IP RIDE....I DONT CARE ABOUT MY GRAMMER IM SO DONE WITH THIS GAME.

The graphics are certainly outdated already, but its okay. With limited options (they also made "Ride") in this genre, i won't be too critical. MotoGP 15 looks much better, probably better off picking up the basic "compact" version of it for cheap.\n\nSome others mentioned bugs, but not enough to think it would be a issue. Well despite being modest graphics (my pc is fine for most of the latest and greatest games and meets the requirements) in the 5 minutes I was able to play it had frame-rate issues and then just froze up and after a few minutes of CTRL-ALT-DEL, ESC and no responses I had to just turn off the PC without a proper shutdown!  So I restarted, lowered the graphics settings and tried again. It froze up in the menus before even starting this time.  I had very few issues with any of my games or my pc - this game must be full of bugs and don't want to crash my computer over it now so can't play!  Should give refunds for this bs!

Didn't really want to buy it at first since i already got 13 but the heavy discount made me want to try it for myself and see what all the fuss is about.\n\nFirst, lets talk about the one race (Termas de Rio Hondo) which was exceedingly hard; i got 8th place. Incidentally, that is acceptable for career mode since the team's objective for this round is only 15th place.\n\nhttp://dai.ly/x4anen3\n\nFunny that this video haz got more views than my other MotoGP14 videos in which i did well, go figure :D\n\nOk, on hindsight, this poor position may be due to the default setup for the bike which usually seems to be set to fail / lose for every track. It's not really bad per se but it's a safe setting that doesn't allow you to push the performance to it's limit. Furthermore, i did not experiment enough with all the setups nor retried the race too many times so maybe i could've done better.  This explains the frequent difficulty in handling the bike around the corners or poor top speed or poor acceleration when you go by the default setups but the above example is an extreme exception. Most of the tracks so far has been quite easy to master. As of this writing i've just completed the 8th round of the Career mode (TT Assen in The Netherlands) but it's not uploaded yet due to having exceeded my daily upload limit.\n\nIMO the developers want the players to fiddle with the setups to get the best results and learn in the process rather than hand-hold them all the way to the last race of the season with optimal setups for every track and every bike. Furthermore, as the bike gets upgrades, the optimal setup will need adjustments.\n\nThe only problem as far as i can see, a minor one at that, is the inability to save custom key bindings. As for the much gripe about difficulty in winning, there's one other oft overlook aspect; bike upgrades. Initially career mode is tough to win even against easy AI. I thought the AI somehow cheated but really, as a newcomer to the sport, no one expects you to win a podium finish. Besides, a new team is likely to have sub-par bike components and inexperience in bike setups so it's a realistic scenario you're put through. You're afterall an unproven rookie rider so don't expect the top teams to take you in.\n\nSo what about the exit bugs? Well in the beginning i didn't encounter it until i went into the Career mode. So the claims that it occurs in the Career mode is true but only half true. You see it only exists in full-screen (fs) mode. Not sure if it occurs in all fs resolutions but since i started using windowed mode, i've never looked back. You can see for yourself in this video and also in some other videos of mine that exit is possible in Career mode; just need to press Alt-F4. ( ok shameless self-promotion here :p )\n\nhttp://dai.ly/x4bz25i\n\nAs for the complaints about the lack of in-game graphic options, well there's some options you can set in the launcher. And if you need more tweaking, you can use manual override in the graphics driver app. For sure the options are not as extensive as in some games but it's enough to allow balance between performance and image quality. A note about graphics quality; many people say it's dated. Maybe so but if you compare the in-game graphics of Losail night race in the rain and the real-life video of the same which you can find in the unlocked video in the Multimedia feature of the game, you'll find that it's a surprisingly accurate rendition of the actual scene; surface reflections and all.\n\nIn summation, this game is thoroughly enjoyable - just give it a fair chance. As of this writing, i've already put 34 hours into it. Nothing to complain about really and no game breaking bugs. If you're afraid of savegame corruption just make a backup of the savegame directory which can be found in C:\Users\"your username"\AppData\Roaming\Milestone .\n\nFinal note: The replay highlights which was present in perhaps all previous MotoGP and SBK series has been removed from this version so you'll have to find your own interesting portion of the replays yourself.\n\nVerdict: 7.5/10 Would be 8.5 if the developers didn't skimp on graphics options or game features present in previous iterations. Highly recommended if you don't already own 13, recommended if you're a fan of the series or if you're like me and just want to find out for yourself what's all the hoopla surrounding this release.\n\nUnrelated side note: Of all the motorcycle games from Milestone, the one i like best is really Ride just 'coz the scenery is varied instead of just typical track layout. If only Ride has a massive open-world map like Test Drive Unlimited 2 then it would be perfect !!! Either TDU3 needs more motorcycles or Ride needs more open-world. :D","May 21","true","59.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
