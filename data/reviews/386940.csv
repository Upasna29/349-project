After months of impatiently waiting for the release, my friends and I had to wait a bit more before the online functionality was available. Today it came, and even though there were bugs, the gameplay shone through and proved to be just as fun as I expected.\n\nThis is a great game to play with your friends. 2 players is fun but it gets exponentially better with more. The best part? Your movement is client-side, meaning you can comfortably play this with people across the world.\n\nThe gameplay is the real selling point, but the presentation deserves special mention as well. The art style fits the hilarious quirky gameplay very well, and is well animated. The sound effects are a perfect compliment to the visuals, from the UI to the sound of your character's head bumping a ceiling. And the sheep makes adorable noises!\n\nAside from the bugs which the developers are working hard to eradicate, this is a great example of how to make a fun online party game. Don't give this a second thought if you're looking for a good time full of laughs with friends.","March 12","true","4.7"," 26 of 26 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","26","26","0","1"

The objective is simple, get to the goal. But you don't want the other playes to as well. Make platforms to help you get accross, and set traps to slow others down. If you love having friends over for playing party games this is a must have! It is an easy game to learn, but very hard to master. This is because you may have the game down, but your friends may be seeing something you do, and put an end to your happy-go-lucky attatude!

I've never seen anything quite like this, it's almost like its own genre. They describe it very well in their first trailer with the comparison of it being a combination of a game of chicken and a round of horse.\n\nRounds often get pretty chaotic if your friends really embrace the true nature of this game, and that is to sabotage eachother.\n\nClever Endeavour really nailed it with this one.\n\nGorgeous animation with a very unique and adorable style. I absolutely love the voice acting as well.\n\nI met two of the gentlemen from Clever Endeavour at PAX prime last year and it was a great way to really understand all the work that went into this game.","March 4","true","4.7"," 22 of 27 people (81%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","81","22","27","0","0"

For the purposes of this review, please know that I have not used the local play options (due to a lack of people to play with near me) and have only been using the online beta.\n\nThis title is one that I was interested in from the moment I came across it prior to its actual release. As an avid fan of platformers and games where you have a certain degree of creative control (level editors), this game fit me like a glove. And once I saw that the game was going to recieve the online treatment, I knew I needed it ASAP.\n\nI have no regrets.\n\nOn its surface, the gameplay is your average platformer. You can move with WASD, jump with the spacebar, and interact with certain elements of the world with your mouse. There is a wall jump mechanic, and you can even single wall jump. The best part: it all feels very fluid and responsive. But once you add in the multiplayer race aspect and the level customization, the game becomes much, much more complicated. You want to make it possible, but you also want to make it very difficult so that you and only you can finish. You also want to figure out the fastest way to complete the level (which is set up differently every time you play) so that you have higher chances of winning.\n\nThere is a very good variety of level gimmicks available to you, but most of them need to be unlocked. That's not necessarily a bad thing though: the two stages that are available to you from the get-go, while fairly basic, are good for honing your skills in the game in a relatively safe environment. My personal favorite stage is unfortunately the one that you unlock last, but I can't really fault the developers for putting it there because the gimmick is fairly eye-straining.\n\nFor all you fans of hats out there (and I know you are out there), the game offers a decent selection of characters and character specific cosmetic items for use in game. All characters are balanced equally, so no one will get an advantage if they choose to use one character over another. The current build of the online beta as of the time of me writing this review has some issues with cosmetics, so I would recommend local play if you can swing it if you want to use them.\n\nFinally, the current online beta runs exceptionally well for being a beta. There are public games available for anyone at most times of the day, and hosting a public game is as simple as specifying a region and pressing a button. If you don't have people to play with locally, you can probably find someone online to play with. Be warned: there is no chat right now, but one might be planned for the future. If you feel the need for a chat, I would recommend waiting for a bit before purchasing. Last I checked there is an emote system coming soon, but even then I'm aware that doesn't work for everyone.\n\nIf you are a fan of platformers and level editors, I highly recommend that you get this game. I don't think you'll be disappointed.","April 24","true","73.2"," 19 of 23 people (83%) found this review helpful","83","19","23","0","0"

I can't wait for online mode so I can play when I don't have people over. I've been playing this for a few months now and I've found that the game has continued to developer over time into a great platform that can continue to expand with more levels, props, tools, etc to change the pace of the game.\n\nDisclaimer: I was provided a key a month or so before release for free for review purposes, I was in no way told to give a positive review, paid for the review, or given any other favor for the review.

This feels like something that should have been included in Mario Maker, a level editor with creations challenged on the spot by everyone in the room at once then mishapen and malformed into a series of death machines and seemingly impossible jumps. The makeshift look to the whole experience and the cuddly animals building and falling prey to their own WMDs adds an amazing comical effect to each session; I couldn't remember a game I'd laughed so consistently with, and the goofs were built by my friends and I!

If everyone reaches the goal, no one gets points.  If no one reaches the goal, no one gets points.  If everyone reaches the goal but someone gets a coin, then only that person gets points.  If 3 out of 4 people or less reach the goal, then those people get points.  Get enough points and you win the game (and everyone returns to level selection tree).\n\nThere is one major problem with the game though: to be able to play well you need to use a gamepad.  It's too difficult without it.  if you can't get a gamepad, then i suggest instead of using WASD to control movement, use the arrow keys (left hand on sprint/run and right hand on movement)\n\nIf you like TF2, Gmod: TTT or Gmod: Prop Hunt.

You need to place objects in the world to make it possible for you to reach the end, but harder for others to follow you.\n\nThe gameThe strength of this game lies in the ever-evolving levels. What once was as simple as jumping across five platforms, soon turns into a death race with black holes and death traps everywhere. The game is arguably going to be at its best when played locally because of how easy it is to communicate, plot and yell at your friends. It might still be fun using skype or similar, but it remains to be seen how well this game holds up when playing with complete strangers whom you can’t talk to.\n\nThis game features a fair amount of unlockable stages and costume pieces, so the game will remain fun as you keep playing it. The process of unlocking could easily have been a grind, but they managed to avoid that by adding something new after every game. The process of gaining the levels or costume is very interesting and unique: you have to, while competing, build something to get to the box that contains the unlockable. This leads to a team effort to mess everybody’s chances of winning up, and more often than not makes the rest of that match a lot more interesting.\n\nThere are a lot of parts, all of which can be used together in amazing ways. For example, you can use the rather ordinary platform with a saw, put some honey on it, and have an instant death trap for anyone who lands on it. And it only gets crazier as the game goes on, as more and more parts get placed. And if the level gets too hard, you always can still destroy some particularly troublesome parts. No parts will ever be used in the exact same way twice, and no game will be the same. It’s the perfect system to give infinite replayability.\n\nEach game will take about 5 minutes to complete, which is the perfect length for this game. Play sessions will generally be longer than that though, when everyone keeps wanting to play one more time. All of the game rules can be changed – if there’s something that’s not quite right for what you currently want, you can most likely change that.\n\nSummary+ Ever changing levels\n+ Lots of parts\n+ Interesting possibilities for interactions between parts\n+ Short games and simple to set up\n\n(-) Online may not be as good as local play\n\nConclusionI can find nothing bad to say about this game. The only thing that could possibly keep me from playing this, is its local play requirement and limited fun otherwise. But if you’re looking for local play game, then look no further than this.","March 26","true","2.1"," 5 of 9 people (56%) found this review helpful","56","5","9","0","0"

Its "single player" portion - basically a hotseat mode - works fine, but is kinda boring and gets repetitive even if you somehow manage to get 3 or 4 people huddled together around the monitor in this day and age. The online multiplayer is where the meat of the game is supposed to be, but as of now it's not even enabled in the latest stable build and you have to switch the beta mode on just to try it. Not that you'd want to because synchronization is god-awful: sometimes characters start flying all around the screen, passing through walls and solid objects. Connecting to servers also only works whenever it feels like and the cosmetics you've collected often won't appear in the wardrobe in a network session... Even the GUI and the camera are glitchy - random hints appear during online matches and the screen doesn't always follow the surviving players correctly, leading to a lot of frustration. If you ask me, the problems listed above are more than enough reason to request a refund.\nStay away unless you plan to play it during a rare house party or until the devs actually finish working on the second and bigger half of the game... And add a ton more levels and items for Ultimate Chicken Horse to reach the level of variety that similar games such as Transformice offer.","May 7","false","1.5"," 7 of 18 people (39%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","39","7","18","0","3"

But it doesn't work 90% of the time. If you're looking to play online (which the general public always is), stay away. The online connectivity is so unstable that it's almost as funny as the actual game. You'll often be faced with black screens trying to connect, or other players flying and floating around randomly when connected, and always, ALWAYS having the game randomly ended just because one person disconnects either intentionally or not. Or maybe your character just can't be moved at all after starting, or the camera will stay off your character completely after someone else finishes the level. The bugs are large in number, and far too many and severe for online connectivity which should be a fairly trivial thing to set up and make work correctly in this day and age.\n\nI'll change this review when the online functionality becomes reasonably usable, because the game otherwise is quite entertaining.","May 10","false","7.8"," 6 of 16 people (38%) found this review helpful","38","6","16","0","4"

Sadly I cannot say the same and have requested a refund. The games audio does not work, it simply cuts in and out frequently to where it is horrible with no fixes. I have checked everywhere for a fix but can't find one. I can't use key mechanics to the game EVEN after rebinding the keys. It will NOT allow me to sprint. The game itself is incredibly laggy, to the point where it is unplayable at the moment, however, this could be due to my current internet as I am in a different location than I usually would be and the internet is much slower, so I will say that the internet would be my fault. If a game DEV is to see this please do contact me on the matter as I would LOVE to play your game but at the moment it's a lump of ♥♥♥♥ to play for myself.

This game should have at the very least been an early access game or held off until ready.\n\nThe characters change intermittently off to the side, the layout of the tools for some reason changed from a great format in the demo to a mess, the couch coop is often disappearing and the online play is an absolute mess.\n\nI loved the demo, still do, but this game was not ready for release. They don't even have a tutorial function ready that deals with the new way to unlock things. Any information I have found has been out of game which is unacceptable. People are blindly defending these devs for reasons unknown, I have seen other titles thrown off cliffs for less.\n\nI cannot understand how you are charging to have us, beta testers, test and report bugs for you.

The other is the players as in most game, some back out if you get a few points ahead and since i'm pretty good at the game i'm lucky if I ever get to finish a game.

For $15 dollars, Ultimate Chicken Horse certainly offers enough longevity and fun.\n\nCheck out our first impressions in our new video.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HnvVWSnCtTg&feature=youtu.be","March 15","true","0.1"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

This game is incredibly fun and easy to use. It's a blast to play a map for a long time and eventually find new ways around obstacles someone placed to troll.\n\nI've played games such as Gang Beasts, Duck Game, Speedrunners, and HIPS with them but this is by far one of  the best. It's mechanics and silliness will keep us entertained for a long time to come. The level progression is very simple and easy to get used to, you play a number of games and inside one of them a box will pop up. If you open the box by hitting it, you unlock skins, characters, or levels. Great game. I expect to play this much more","March 17","true","13.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

It's as difficult as you or your so-called friends make it, and even people who aren't particularly good at platformers compared to their friends can still enjoy creating elaborate death-traps and ridiculous timing puzzles. The simple, cute graphics (though there's some really nice touches still; the way the animals hold the cursors makes me smile), the calming music and the slightly silly sound effects for the animals might make you briefly forget how much hate you harbour towards whoever put a hockey puck launcher there. You know who you are. You know what you did.\n\nOh, and the "shared controller" option is a nice touch, so that you can pass a controller around if you've got more players than controllers, which alleviates the need for having multiple controllers normally often required for party games.","March 8","true","1.8"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Along with that: it is also one of the more imaginative games I’ve played in a long time. Mixing up platforming with player-created-on-the-spot levels is genius.\n\nWhile this game can be played with two people, or yourself and three other controllers, The Ultimate Chicken Horse is a dish best served with three other people (always better with friends)! As the level changes after every round as dictated by each player, the levels only get crazier and crazier. Unless someone uses the bomb and cleans it up a little. However, sometimes some spring cleaning is in order unless you don’t really want to progress.\n\nAllowing on-line play was one of the smartest moves for Clever Endeavour Games. It’s not something that I can remember many small party games like this having missed lately, but it is something I could see someone taking a stance on. “Get your friends over like we did back in the day.” That’s weird to some people, but that was the norm back when I was a kid. It’s buggy currently, but they are diligently working on it. All this to say: it will still be more fun with your buds right there to punch.\n\nI can understand the way multplayer is done currently, but it’s not my favorite. Given the flavor of the game, a more open multiplayer would have been more appreciated. However, since trying to make my own game and getting caught up with tiny details not working, if it was this “port-forwarding-friend-menu”method or nothing, then this trumps any complaint. I simply got used to this method of connecting with Magicite, but didn’t really appreciate it because of the lack of friends playing the same game. I like these type of games while not many of my buds would be willing to drop as little change down as Ultimate Chicken Horse costs. A more fluid, server-based multiplayer would have opened the floodgates to a more populated online experience in an ideal world. It could very well have been a lot of time spent coding and then been underused and that time could have been better spent. There are to many variables and let’s just say that I’m happy to at least have the option.\n\nScore: Tasty!\n\nUltimate Chicken Horse is pretty darn unique. It still surprises me that some devs can come up with something like this out of nowhere when it feels like it should have been a part of our gaming library for a long time now. There are a lot of tools to hinder you and your friends with and enough levels to add some variety to the gameplay. Ultimate Chicken Horse is definitely worth picking up if you’ve got some buds that enjoy good platforming fun-time.","April 10","true","2.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

I was really shocked, how can it be possible? But yeah lesson learned, there is actually "other kind" people than you. Now I know, who I like more to play with.\n\nI think this game is far better and funnier than Gang beats.

So this is a platforming game up to 4 players with an empty map, you build a map either with the party box, where everything gets shuffled and you have to take one out of four pieces (the faster gets his desired piece) that's the party mod, in creative mod you choose your blocks from the catalog and build it up.\nAt one point you need to make the map possible to make, but challenging enough, so no other makes it to the red flag (at least one has to fail or no points will be scored). you also have traps that you can build in that give you also points for kills.\n\nI've played it alot and it's always a good laugh, no matter what age you are, if you like editing maps with always new challanges, you will love it.\n\n(NOTE: for online multiplayer you have to download the beta update)\n\nonly downside, it is still quite buggy and in an early stage, so bugs can and will happen.","April 19","true","35.6"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

They're constantly updating the game so if you run into a problem make a bug report and it might not even be there in a week which I must congradulate the makes of this game for. I only have two issues with this game both not being the developers problems. First one is that the game isn't super popular yet which in my experiance I don't find many lobbies and when I host one no one joins. The other is the players as in most game, some back out if you get a few points ahead and since i'm pretty good at the game i'm lucky if I ever get to finish a game. They also want to play on creative so they block of the goal, if this happens try and be the last one to place an object and just pick the bomb and make the game winnable.

It's great for group play... amongst responsible and polite friends. In the hands of irresponsible children, though, it becomes a torture chamber. The problem starts when someone struggles to succeed and decides to get their joy from building deadly traps for others to suffer through, all out of spite. For this reason, the game's online mode would probably be equally torturous. As long as the players are all polite and responsible, this game is fanstastic fun for all to enjoy.

The controls and goal of the game are incredibly simple, making it very easy to pick up and play.  I am eagerly anticipiating the future of this game (online multiplayer and hopefully someday a single-player puzzle mode)!\n\nThe only "drawback" I can think of for the game is the information available about it.  I tried finding how many levels and characters were unlockable, but couldn't find any information on the internet (or in-game).  Even this, though, has lead to some surprising fun when my friends and I get together and find a "question mark" on one of the levels.

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/84Lizzer/recommended/386940/","84Lizzer","Lizzer","http://steamcommunity.com/id/84Lizzer/","39 products in account","This game is stupidly addicting. It is a great game for laughs and simply farting around. It's great regardless of whether or not you're playing with friends. It really amazes me how great the levels turn out  (in most cases) despite us being able to place whatever and wherever (also for the most part). I really enjoy seeing how clever people are. You can even turn on creative and make a stupid big moving contraption if you're bored.\n\nThere are issues as with all games, and from my experiences in multiplayer there are a few bugs. The servers occasionally drop and everyone has to restart their servers, and people can't move sometimes and then have to restart their game. These are the two biggest issues imo, which briefly interrupt gameplay, but due to how fast the game loads I can forgive it. And it must be kept in mind that online multiplayer is in beta.\n\nOn another note I do really love all the characters, maps, items and current customization there. I do hope in the future after most bugs have been ironed out of online multiplayer that more characters, maps, items, and outfits are added. Even if nothing more is added, I honestly feel like I've gotten my money's worth out of this game already. I've had such a blast.","June 5","true","42.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Although lag may sometimes looks like your opponents were hit and didn't die, that's just purely graphic problem.","June 6","true","5.2"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
