Even worst, if you guess wrongly, you lose the game.\n\nI guess it is really like a reality game where you have to guess the preference of the judges, but it does not feel super hero worthy at all.\n\nUnlike the first game where I get the feeling of actually giving my super hero a personality, this one seems to be about making random choice with unknown consequence again and again.","June 19, 2014","false","2.5"," 200 of 266 people (75%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","75","200","266","0","5"

A family member assured me I was wrong and that the series got better in The Hero Project - to their credit, they were right.\n\nHowever, even in that case, THP barely struggles to make *average*. The writing style continues to be quite sophomoric and not in the entertaining sense of being young. It's sophomoric in the sense of awkward phrasing, juvenile handling of sex and bizarre, immersion-shattering rants about correct gender pronouns. It's immature and banal. Look, I get that more games should deal with sex and gender, and I get that interactive fiction is one of the best genres for it, but Zachary Sergi needs to handle it with a bit more deftness. Credit for attempting it.\n\nTo Sergi's additional credit, there are some interesting choices in this game. I thought many of the ones relating to Null and Lucky were quite good and hard to choose from. Unfortunately, much like the previous entry in the series, THP suffers from the stark feeling of being stuck on rails with an author that's waiting to jump out and go 'aha!' at you for not picking the right choice (while giving you no indication of what might be the right choice unless you *pay for it as an in-game app store-esque purchase*. THP, however, seems to have less of those ridiculous options like The Prodigy had (infilrating and forgetting to take off your hero costume, anyone?) - so, that's some improvement. But it's still not embracing the strength of an interactive medium because good IF rewards choices and does its best to disguise the rails (eg; Choice of Robots).\n\nMuch of the worldbuilding and setting continues to be a bit on the nose - again, it's very sophomorric. The fact that Sergi continues to interject 'slugger' into so many sentences as a catch all term that seems to be a general epithet, noun, verb, adjective and so on is lazy. Honestly, if there is one thing I could remove from this whole trilogy, it's this word. As a whole, the world feels very derivative of superhero comics and doesn't offer much in the way of originality.\n\nFor a simple premise (superhero reality TV) the plot has too many characters (of course, expecting you to remember/care about all of them) and a slow development where things just seem to happen. I'm not sure how much control over my story I actually had, thanks to the aforementioned of feeling like I'm on rails. What's worse, is that the characters aren't particularly likeable - again, due to the writing style.\n\nSo, what's good about it? Well, there's a fair bit of customisation. If you're looking to feel like you're in a superhero story and you want a bit of a self-insert fantasy where you can craft your dreamworld to exacting specifications then this is for you. If you want something that advances the medium of IF, offers interesting, branching choices with clever writing and wit - avoid. As someone who looks for the latter, I cannot recommend THP.\n\nAdditionally, I ran into a bug near the end that caused me to need to restart my entire story. I won't mark the game down for that but it was quite unfortunate.","April 12, 2015","false","4.6"," 15 of 21 people (71%) found this review helpful","71","15","21","0","0"

Some people may point to the fact that the game is linear and that occasionally your choices may make you feel "Boxed In", however, the choices presented to you are great enough and of a large enough depth that you may deviate from the main story arc and play the kind of hero you may want to play, however you will soak the fallout for whatever decisions you might choose.\n\nIn short; the game is good, and gives you more entertainment than expected of a game with such a small pricetag.\nOh, and if you have the few extra units of whatever currency you possess, buy the bundle or the perfect legend guide + warning system.

After the fame generated from Prodigal and her Deathwave, you are trying to find a way to keep your legend level high. Your best idea to do this is to join a reality TV show called the Hero Project, which the top six winners will join a team of superheroes supported by the government. Black Magic, Jury, Mayor Victon, Jenny, and your Grandmother all make appearances. You can continue your relationship with Black Magic, if your were in one, or you can start a relationship with Jenny or another Hero named Lucky. Black Magic is pretty jerky in this one, so I went with Lucky, who is sweet. At the end you can import your save file into the third game, which some of the romances in the third one require the romance to have been completed in this game. Also you do not have to import a save file from the previous game and you can start fresh.\nSome of the bad things were: you cannot save and load in the game, so if you do not like a choice you made, you are stuck with it, the legend guide that you unlock isn't that helpful, they could have added more achievements, and sometimes it was hard to tell how a choice would affect your stats. Overall it is a good game that is well written. Some complain about ending up at the same place regardless of the choice you make, but that is sort of the point to keep the story moving, and it being written out. Sometimes you'll unlock scenes you didn't see on a previous playthough.","July 19, 2014","true","3.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

(Spoilers ahoy)\n\nThe Good\nThe story is even better than the last one, with twists and turns that will keep you guessing on your first time playthrough. It has a feeling to it that really gets you tense and pumped up for what happens in the story.\n\nThe characters have varying types of personalities and most have semi-realistic personalities.\n\nThe Bad\nEven though the story is better this time round it has even more problems than the last one. While the first one felt linear it wasn't glaringly obvious, unlike in this one. Never before have I felt that the choices I made had no impact to the game. Everything I did just felt like poking a wall, it changed nothing. No matter what you do you will ALWAYS get as far as the final eliminations and all that changes is how the ending starts off.\n\nAlthough I said most characters feel semi-realistic it is not the MAIN characters that feel that way, tis the side characters. Jenny has a "My way or the high way" attitude and she will force you to leave the competion just so she can do her investigation, even though she clearly states that you are also apart of it and can continue it without her. However you never can and don't even get the option to look into it YOURSELF!\n\nBlack Magic has a complete personaltiy reversal! In the first game he/she is kind, caring and can be a bit forceful in her methods. But overall she/he is a good person. In this story she becomes narcisitic, confrontational, manipulative and even cruel. She/he goes out of her way to stay in the competition and will pit you against another potential love interest, even if you say that you aren't interested in her/him.\n\nRexford is played like an ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• like ALL the obvious bad guys are, its like the writer didn't even try to hide the fact he's the bad guy. His stat is useless and changes nothing so don't even try to pander to him.\n\nThe Ugly\nIn the last review I said that the choices were biast to one specific style of play, going for the "Correct" options. For example saving a reporter or your Sidekick, saving the reporter was seen as only wanting fame and saving your Sidekick was the "Hero" way. In this story its even worse, as the types of play actually have catergories now! Which makes them even more narrow minded than before! It makes it feel like you are meant to play the game ONE way and if you try to do it another way prepare for so many penalties you'll feal like Oliver Twist asking for more food. "CHOICES?! How dare you ask to be different and do things your way! GET BACK TO MY WAY OR GET OUT!". Why can't you get the teams to work together to get Culic or save the people in the Tunnel? Why is stoping Culic, a Leader of super-Terrorists, consider pandering to fame when stoping him there might stop the current attack AND save lives!? Why do you always get low scores when you actually perform the best you can actually do at a trial?! The max points you can get is 90 when doing a team training trial and even if you get perfect scores for each you will always be at the bottom! So you are forced into the situation of either leaving the finals or outing your friend to get further in the competition. Why can't I actually get past this with good points?! Even though I got my Gold key at the near the start I still come at the bottom, exactly the same outcome if you take the longer "Correct" way! What the hell is this?!\n\nThere's also the fact that most of the statistics for stats and relationships don't matter for most of the characters it shows! Rebellion's stat does nothing, Rexford's Stat does nothing, and Grandma's stat does NOTHING! Why are they even there if it changes nothing story wise, gameplay wise, or even freaking conversation wise?! What's the point of the Control and Unleash guage when going either way does NOTHING! Being in complete control of your powers does nothing, so if you think it means that when you use you Infini powers it isn't as bad as if you didn't. You will ALWAYS fail at evacuating everyone at the Castle with infini powers.\n\nConclusions\nThis is meant to be a Text adventure GAME, but it really just feels like a story with slight variations in what happen. If you have played text games you should now that it has much more freedom in what you can do and actually feel like you choices matter. Here its just a story with fake options that do nearly nothing.\n\nOverall even though this game is better than the last it has even more problems that nearly negate every gain it has made. Even though I reccommend this game I still caution you on buying it. If you like it when most of the control you get does nothing and only want to see a story play out then by all means buy this. But if you want a Text adventure GAME than I'm afraid this isn't up to snuff yet.\n\nPersonal score: 6/10","June 30, 2014","true","21.9"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","67","2","3","0","0"

I swear, they check every dumb sexuality box. There's a dude who is of a race that has no specific gender and insists on different pronouns. Maybe that's a cool sci-fi concept.

The game follows a reality TV concept that is really interesting, as it constantly puts you in situations where its impossible to please everyone, the story, like the first game is still quite linear, but it makes you feel like you've made a difference anyway, quite similar to Telltales The Walking Dead game. This game is almost twice as long as the previous game, and its writing quality has only improved, as well as being more in depth too, there are a bunch of relationships in this game, and favouring one will displease the other, trying to please everyone is an incredibly hard path to take and may earn you more enemies than anything else\n\nFantastic game at a really good price, if you're a fan of the first, definitely check it out, if you thought the first game was lacking somewhat, then this one might change your mind on the series since its better in practically everyway. As should be obvious, if you dislike reading, then this isnt a game for you, and if you're looking for big epic storytelling or Game of Thrones level intruige, then once again this probably isnt the game for you. But if you want to sit down for a few hours, and just have fun with a story, then I wholeheartedly reccomend it.","June 24, 2014","true","10.8"," 4 of 7 people (57%) found this review helpful","57","4","7","0","0"

It has all the things that made the first installment great - however it ends on a cliffhanger.\n\nThis all by itself would not be that bad but I went through the in-game store to buy the third and last chapter. This is where my nightmare started.\n\nAlthough I don't own it on steam, I do own herofall on the website. When I bought it, herofall wasn't on steam yet, so I didn't think it would be a big deal if I purchased ahead of time - many other games support you if you go through their website, in fact most games I know actually prefer that you do it that way since they get more from you directly and don't have to pay anything to steam. However because the game is not on steam I cannot continue my character from the first and second game - this defeats all the effort I put into my character from both games. I contacted them figuring it would be an easy enough fix to move a save file or something, but after weeks of back and forth emails it breaks down to me needing to start all over if I want to play herofall.\n\nI chose all my decisions carefully from the first and second game and to hell if I can remember all of them, nor do I want to sit through both games clicking forever to get to the same spot again. The only other option I have is to buy the game again through steam but I am really against buying a game I already own. It's not like a PS game that I own that I want on the PC, it's a computer game I own that I want on my computer... and I can't have it.\n\nNow that Herofall is on steam I DO recommend buying the entire pack or just the first game if your hesitant. Definitely avoid the in-game option of buying it though.","August 3, 2014","false","7.0"," 10 of 19 people (53%) found this review helpful","53","10","19","0","0"

It is extremely well written, with complex characters (some aspects chosen by you the player, in how NPC's are described) and motivations which affect how the story goes into the sequel as well. I actually became quite attached to my character, and replayed the game if I ever made a gaffe I didn't like. (Sometimes I was cursing myself for making silly mistakes, other times I wanted to explore various choices and see there effects).\n\nTwo issues I have to disagree with in a small critique. Choices concerning saving lives or taking them ought to trump any ideology your character pursues.  There are instances in the game where your choices are locked into one decision or another based on previous choices your character has made. I disagree with this aspect, and hope the author will fix such issues to open the life/death choices in the novel to either choice regardless of chosen path.\n\nThe 2nd issue involves the first, and I'm not quite sure if this is a bug, since I was unable to save game at midpoints. I suppose saving games midstory would detract from the choices one, but it really would be nice if that feature were available, so that I wouldn't have to restart each game from scratch to explore various choices.\n\nOtherwise, I really enjoyed the series, and again, for $4.00 got a lot of hours of gameplay in. Seeing as I usually rate games based upon how much the cost per hour I play, I'd say this interactive novel is easily a 10/10.","June 19, 2014","true","12.8"," 18 of 36 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","18","36","0","0"

This adventure takes you into a reality TV show for superheroes, though I'm not sure I would want any of these heroes saving me.\n\nOne of the biggest issues I have with "my" adventures up to now are the romantic options.

I think the writing overall was better then the first story, I wasn't pulled out of my adventures as much as I was in Prodigy.

I'll be honest, I was a little disappointed with a reality show setting, but after finishing the adventure I can at least see why it was chosen.\n\nSome of the most important choices during my adventure though felt emotionally powerful, but it wasn't always my emtions that were moved. As I had mentioned, sometimes I'm watching this lead hero react not in a way I would have in the same position. Also, with the given choices, more then a few times during combat I feel like there is no gray area between "nuclear bomb" and "don't move". When this occurs, I tend to take into account how angry I am at the target, or how serious they have attacked me.\n\nOverall, I would say I enjoyed this adventure and where it might lead too, even if it was a little obvious from the begining.

The game finally drops all pretense to being about superheroes and crimefighting and reaches its ultimate nadir when you're shoved into a room where your supporting cast (an effeminate gay, a masculine gay, a lesbian and two transexuals) argue over who is most oppressed.

Not as great as the original so far, but still pretty good. So I'm figuring you've already played 1 if you're reading the review for 2. Have you? No? Too bad I'm telling spoilers for the first game anyways. So as the competition started in this weird reality tv show thing. My character imported from the last game and named Metal Man a comic I made on this comic website before I took writing classes. I was with my lover Black Magic and we were gonna do this together. The first challenges were easy, I recklessly went through them in a flash. As it went on though they got harder and I met new heroes along the way, and I met a long lost girlfriend from hero camp, which her name will be disclosed do to the evil called spoliers. So basically I was still heads over heels with Black Magic, so I said "Get out da' way b*tch" at the time. Than I actually started to have feelings for her and Black Magic at the same time I was torn and not knowing what to do, I had also just made an alliance with two beginner heroes. Not knowing how the f*ck the voting system worked i thought giving them votes would help them stay on the show and helping these young aspiring heroes become stars or a vigilante like me. I accidentally voted one off and the other had a vendetta for me basically, I really felt bad and did the other challenges which were getting harder from me not focusing and the guilt overwhelming me as the next elimination sequence was coming. What the f*ck do I do? Black Magic my love says I have to vote childhood girlfriend off, or she'll break up with me. Then childhood girlfriend is like "Don't abandon me a**hole remember me? I was your first kiss." Of course I remember your a** you were my first kiss. I was given an option to vote off both, childhood girlfirend, or Black Magic. I was litterally sweating what was I going to do, I knew Black Magic so well and my character loved her, but childhood girlfriend was also very dear to his heart with him knowing her since childhood. So I came to the decision to boot off childhood girlfriend. After that I was strucken withe more guilt. Taking off beginners left and right, like they were babies it didn't feel right. I spent the rest of the night with Black Magic with something ringing in my mind. "Did I make the right choice?" I was also put in chrage of multiple heroes in the group I chose when I eliminated my first beginner. I took down multple heroes on tema two using tactics including Black Magic and another guy with metal bending or whatever the f*ck power it was. I was then pressured to use steroids so I said f*ck no. Apparently that b*tch Jessica from the last game dressed up in a costume and litterally turned full bada** for no literal reason. No training, it was only a year or two after the first game... so yeah, the game kinda pulled "She's a bada** now, so just deal with it." So I was like okay and jacked off for a lot of the other sections of the game until a decision came. Do I rat out Jenny because she's undercover (It's okay because none of you know her name so it's no spoiler, well it kinda is. Bah, f*ck it.) or do I stick up for her and be a "good friend." By giving up all my hopes and dreams. So I make the obvious choice of not being a tattletale because we're totally in first f*cking grade and I've been eliminated from the competition. So uh yeah. Kinda f*cked up there. Did it ever occur to you that I'm a swearaholic? So I still lve wth my grandma for now with my me thingy named Winston. Than dun-dun-dun somebodies elected president that is bad, seriously just guess, I won't say his name but if your not ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• or have short term memory loss you'll know. Also have I mentioned my character has been going insane lately, it should be obvious. But I'm disgusted by his new found victory, so like a 2 year old who still doesn't have his apple juice I whine about it. I also whine about how Black Magic is in a coma because this one a**hole as pissy fit on the battlefield. But as my character slowly turns evil and down this dark unsettling tunnel I decide I'm ready to move on from Black Magic for, she may never wake up from this coma. I then see Jenny and along with the five other winners win leaving a pit of regret in my stomach, wishing I could be the one in first place not her, but sadly I sacrificed everything to help the b*tch who had no powers. So I'm forced away to a concentration camp for infi-powered people by Mr. President, it's also mandatory. They might as well start calling us Jews. So I have a pissy fit myself and destroy the machine myself starting to realize how different I've become since this all began, how I used to pretend to be some sort of Batman, but now I'm starting to look more like this moral sponge which soaks up his own morals and others and spits them out as he abides to no laws modern men will give him. For I am a sponge, designed to soak up oragnge juice and be rubbed against someone's a** cheeks. Jenny was right the beautiful b*stard The Hero Project was in cahoots with infi haters, with it's crosshairs on me. For now, I must stand and fight. For now I must rebel. I must take off this villain mask I think I've been becoming, and show my real face, a bigger and better vigilante. Wintry, Summit, Stage Show, Rebellion, Judy, and Inherit are all coming to take me down, luckily I have Jenny on my side. 2v7, bring it on. I take out the guards and suddenly fumble and childhood girlfriend appear to help me? They say they're on my side so I'm like, maybe I can hook up with Lucky after all and now it's a 4v7 fight, again bring it on. After taking down all but 1 and that is Rexford, which appeared from nowhere he shoots an enegery blast the dampens powers, afraid that Jenny could die from the blast I must be a hero, I jump in front of the blast dampening my infini powers in the process. Everything goes white and I resume the story a while later, my powers weakened but not taken away, and it could be permanent, but I'm guessing it won't. I'm seen as a vigilante icon around the world just how I like it. But that doesn't mean my journey's over. Oh no, I still have the Victon's to worry about. For we're at war.","October 24, 2015","true","6.8"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"

Like the first one (The Prodigy), the events are mostly scripted and the story is linear. However, the Hero Project allows for more choices, and they are tougher to make this time. The writing has improved somewhat and I thought that the Hero Project's story is more well thought-out and better than The Prodigy's. The Hero Project is also lengthier and has higher replayability. Although it is highly recommended that you start with The Prodigy first, it is not necessary. You can just jump right in if you choose to without losing too much of the backstory.\n\nComparisons aside, the elements that make up the Hero Project are dynamic and feature several themes. Politics, betrayal, friendship, romance, conspiracy and so on. The battles are interesting, and the events are emotional, if not dramatic.\n\nTwo tips to maximize your experience:\n1. Get the MeChip Warning System. It's really helpful.\n2.

The choices feel constrained as you need to choose a role and stick to it, this is bad.  The hero feels like a buttmonkey, getting the short end of every stick regardless of your choices.  This producer has better text based games, so don't get this one.  Why they chose the Heroes Rise, one of their earliest works, to put on steam over their better products, I don't know.  Check out their site, choose a different game.\n\nThe Hero Project has a nice world, if not a tad overused (superhero metropolis city). The story however, is lacklustre, in my opinion worse than that of The Prodigy, this game's predecessor.  I won't go into more detail than that.\n\nLike it's predecessor, the decisions do not feel impactual or rewarding beyond juggling you're alignment "meters" of loyal/soloist, popular/underdog and the like.  Unlike the previous game however, this game makes your choices seem constrained, telling you what kind of decisions you SHOULD make, and even MUST make in situations where it may not make sense.  Having your options limited to "insult him", or "insult him in different words", when I felt no desire to do so, or having the game tell me, next time be more "Justice" hit my enjoyment of the game pretty hard.\n\nIn addition, the low level of detail in descriptions, and the lack of impactual additional reading meant that I was not invested in finding out more about the world.  The way the game played out saw me caring less and less about what happened, a deadly feeling to any story based game.\n\nOn the positive side, depending on the roles you choose, there are a ton of different endings.  This game is pretty long for a text based game, and there are some wacky decisions you can make that work in the game's framework.\n\nEven so,\nI recommend getting a different, better text based game.","July 20, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The tale continues with our protagonist (you) who has managed to succeed some degree of going away from being a Zero and becoming a potential Hero. You end up participating in a reality TV show that grants its winners the positions of forming an USA-backed national superhero group. This Choose Your Adventure game adds more elements that can be affected by the way you treat your powers, how you treat others and so on.\nIt's definitely a step up in comparison to the first installment in terms of length and all the stuff you need to keep up with, and despite its departure from your average superhero tail, the game offers tons and tons of plot twists and dramatic turns that keep you engaged and intrigued to the very end.","May 12, 2015","true","17.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

Like the first one (The Prodigy), the events are mostly scripted and the story is linear. However, the Hero Project allows for more choices, and they are tougher to make this time. The writing has improved somewhat and I thought that the Hero Project's story is more well thought-out and better than The Prodigy's. The Hero Project is also lengthier and has higher replayability. Although it is highly recommended that you start with The Prodigy first, it is not necessary. You can just jump right in if you choose to without losing too much of the backstory.\n\nComparisons aside, the elements that make up the Hero Project are dynamic and feature several themes. Politics, betrayal, friendship, romance, conspiracy and so on. The battles are interesting, and the events are emotional, if not dramatic.\n\nTwo tips to maximize your experience:\n1. Get the MeChip Warning System. It's really helpful.\n2. Be consistent in your choices (ex. don't swing from being lawful to lawless, choose one and stick with it and make choices accordingly).","December 30, 2014","true","16.3"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"

The choices feel constrained as you need to choose a role and stick to it, this is bad.  The hero feels like a buttmonkey, getting the short end of every stick regardless of your choices.  This producer has better text based games, so don't get this one.  Why they chose the Heroes Rise, one of their earliest works, to put on steam over their better products, I don't know.  Check out their site, choose a different game.\n\nThe Hero Project has a nice world, if not a tad overused (superhero metropolis city). The story however, is lacklustre, in my opinion worse than that of The Prodigy, this game's predecessor.  I won't go into more detail than that.\n\nLike it's predecessor, the decisions do not feel impactual or rewarding beyond juggling you're alignment "meters" of loyal/soloist, popular/underdog and the like.  Unlike the previous game however, this game makes your choices seem constrained, telling you what kind of decisions you SHOULD make, and even MUST make in situations where it may not make sense.  Having your options limited to "insult him", or "insult him in different words", when I felt no desire to do so, or having the game tell me, next time be more "Justice" hit my enjoyment of the game pretty hard.\n\nIn addition, the low level of detail in descriptions, and the lack of impactual additional reading meant that I was not invested in finding out more about the world.  The way the game played out saw me caring less and less about what happened, a deadly feeling to any story based game.\n\nOn the positive side, depending on the roles you choose, there are a ton of different endings.  This game is pretty long for a text based game, and there are some wacky decisions you can make that work in the game's framework.\n\nEven so,\nI recommend getting a different, better text based game.","July 20, 2014","true","3.0"," No ratings yet","0","0","0","0","0"
