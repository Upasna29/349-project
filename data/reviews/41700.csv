I was alone. There was no tutorial, no introductory cutscene, no explanation, not even a basic explanation of how the game worked. I walked forward, and looked around. I was instantly shocked at the low FOV and uncomfortably "floaty" mouse control. This was not what I was used to - my most played FPS is Team Fortress 2, closely followed by Fallout 3. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. was something else - something new. I was excited. I continued walking and came across three people with guns walking in the other direction. "STOP WAVING THAT THING ABOUT" one of them bellowed, while sticking his assault rifle up my nose. I pressed "e" (because by now I'd explored the options menu and rebound some keys) to speak to him.\n\nWhat was going on? That was a question that I'd ask myself a lot while playing this game. This guy told me absolutely nothing of interest, except that there was a base of some description a little further down the hill. By now I'd figured out what some of the HUD was for, and how to open my inventory. I then went to Skadovsk (although I didn't know what it was called then) and got yelled at to put my gun away again. So I opened my inventory and moved my rifle from its slot into my backpack. I would be doing this for a while until I discovered that I could just "3" to holster my weapon. I then walked into the ship.\n\nI didn't know what the hell I was doing. Where was I? What am I doing here? What do I do now? So I spoke to someone who told me there was a strange glow in the distance that he wanted me to check out. Fair enough, I thought. So I went where the map pointed me and found a ship. I walked onto the ship - and died instantly for (seemingly) no reason. (In actual fact I'd hit an anomaly, I just had no idea what anomalies were or what I was doing.)  Having not saved at any point, I started the game again.\n\nWhen I got to Skadovsk for the second time, I couldn't find the guy I'd previously talked to, so I talked to Sultan instead. He wanted me to help kill some people. Once again, I thought "fair enough" and went with him. At midnight I boarded a boat and once again struggled to see what the ♥♥♥♥ was happening in the darkness. I think I killed someone. And I got some money. So then, being a Fallout veteran and this being an open world game, I decided to go exploring. I went about 100 metres and the game crashed. One thought ran through my mind: "♥♥♥♥ this". I quit the game and didn't come back for at least a month. I ♥♥♥♥ing hated this game. What I piece of ♥♥♥♥, I thought. I couldn't understand the 95% positive review score. This was after about 1 hour's play time. Eventually I was bored and I decided to boot the game again. After switching my lighting renderer from DX10 to DX11 (as the internet told me to) the game didn't crash (although it does crash a lot when trying to enter the "load game" screen). I then tried again. I got to Skadovsk. I talked to Sultan. I did the mission. I learned how to quicksave. From there, I continued (on the easiest difficulty because I'm a casual scrublord).\n\nI then discovered why this game has so many positive reviews. Although the graphics are somewhat dated, the gameplay and atmosphere are second to none. I warmed to the game within another hour. Did some side missions, figured out where I was and what I was doing. I learned what anomalies are. I learned how to collect artifacts. And, ultimately, I learned that Google is my best friend. From this I can see that at least 90% of the negative reviews are either performance issues (there is admittedly a good deal of stuttering in this game) or they are people who, like me, just haven't given the game a chance. I see people in the negative reviews saying how awful the game is with 1.6 hours on record. And I know why. This game tells you absolutely nothing. You know a sum total of jack ♥♥♥♥.\n\nWhy am I dying instantly for no reason? "♥♥♥♥ you, figure it out!" Why do my bullets not work? "♥♥♥♥ you, git gud." What do these numbers and icons mean? "♥♥♥♥ you, use google!" This is a good thing when you've got into the game because it enhances the atmosphere and is more immersive. The downside is it scares away new players who are frustrated by how bad they are at the game. To people who are looking at buying this game: I say buy it and don't give up on it in the first hour. Google things you don't know and teach yourself about the game - this is hardcore FPS survival horror and it does not hold your hand. In actual fact, it amputates your hand, kicks you into the ground and spits on your face. And that's without the Misery mod! If you are strong enough to get past that, it is one of the most atmospheric and immersive games I've ever played. The gunplay is amazing, it feels realistic, and you truly feel like this could be happening and you could be there experiencing it. If you like FPS survival horror, look no further than the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series.\n\nI love this game.\n\nN.B. After going into Pripyat, I went to the Kindergarten to do that mission where you destroy the interference transmitter. It was 1 A.M. and I had my flashlight on as I entered the psy-field. Blew up the door, went inside and the first thing I saw illuminated by my flashlight was the creepiest ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lion I've ever seen. It scared the absolute living ♥♥♥♥ out of me - more than any horror game has ever done.\n\nАНУ ЧИКЙ БРИКЙ В ДАМКЕ","July 22, 2015","true","38.0"," 575 of 602 people (96%) found this review helpful 176 people found this review funny","96","575","602","176","38"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/jmcosta/recommended/41700/","jmcosta","JM@PT","http://steamcommunity.com/id/jmcosta/","332 products in account","Gameplay\nStalker CoP is an open-world RPG survival shooter with 3 large areas Zaton, Yanov and Pripyat, very atmospheric with plenty of side quests that reward exploration.\nThe beginning of the game is tricky with hardly any equipment or money, there's no tutorials or any kind of help so you need to find your own way to survive, isn't an easy game\nThe A-life will not give up until you ran out of ammo or eventually die, some will trow objects at you     Screenshot  and even telekinetically steal your weapon, things appear randomly in the sky or mutants with camouflage   Screenshot   etc. Human opponents put up a tough fight, they kinda cheat in fog weather or at night even without nightvision scopes equipped, (but mods like Misery fixes that) so playind like CoD will get you killed.\nStill includes the emissions and anomalies (detectors needed for finding artifacts  Screenshot  ) and more customization of armor/weapons.\n\n\n\nGraphics\nit features the X-Ray 1.6 engine supports dx11 elements like real time tessellation, shadows, wet surfaces, volumetric smoke and others like SSAO DOF... so in other words it looks good, models and textures are a little outdated but shadows and sun rays are amazing (i recommend to use mods like AtmosFear3 specially designed for sky textures and weather behavior ).\nScreenshot\n\n\nSound\nThe background noise of the zone is enchanting. In the distance, the reactor is booming as before, animals roaring in the west, shootout in the East, everything draws exactly the image of the restricted area as you are used to it.\n\n\n\nMultiplayer\nhas Deathmatch and CTF style competitive matches with its multiplayer mode. Mind you, this doesn't exactly represent the highlight of the experience. If you want to get the best out of this game, stick with the main campaign, for what it's worth.\n\n\nStory\nCall of Pripyat - takes place shortly after the events in Shadow of Chernobyl.\nHaving discovered the open path to the center of The Zone, the government decides to take control of it via "Operation Fairway", in which they plan to thoroughly investigate the territory before dispatching the main military force.\nDespite these preparations, the military operation fails, with all five helicopters crashing. In order to determine the cause of the crashes, the Ukraine Security Service sends an ex STALKER agent, Major Degtyarev, into The Zone\nAfter discovering that the crashes were caused by strong electrical currents, Degtyarev makes his way to an evacuation point located in Pripyat. Along the way, depending on the choices the player makes, he may meet a number of different characters that can become his allies.\nEventually, after arriving in Pripyat, Degtyarev's party finds themselves surrounded by the military survivors, who take them to their base. Once there, they work together with the military commander of the helicopter group in surviving and escaping The Zone.\nThey are met by Strelok, the protagonist of the first game, who offers his full cooperation including the reasons why the operation failed in the first place.\nDegtyarev then helps to re-establish contact with headquarters and, together with Strelok, organize a desperate evacuation out of The Zone. There are multiple different endings available depending on the player's success, whether or not some of the characters survive the evacuation and how the lives of other stalkers Degtyarev met throughout the game turn out.\nIn the ideal scenario, Degtyarev becomes head of the Security Service in The Zone, and Strelok gives all the materials he found in The Zone to the government, prompting the creation of the "Scientific Institute for the Research of the Chernobyl Anomalous Area", with Strelok taking up the position of chief scientific consultant.\n\n\nBugs/Glitches\nIt has soooo many and it will crash or make one or two missions almost unplayable. i recomend to mod the game (some will make it worse lol).\n\n\n\nMODs\n\nMISERY: (for hardcore difficulty) its full concept modification that touches every game aspect including textures, sfx, music, weapons, AI, items, weather, economy and 3 playable USS characters classes to choose from: Assaulter, Recon and Sniper.Each comes with unique attributes like endurance, speed, health, stamina, weapon specializations, starting gear...\n\nAtmosFear: like i said before it tweaks and expands the vanilla weather system to be more realistic and various.\n\nCall of Pripyat Reloaded: it's like misery but for better and easier gameplay.\n\nhttp://www.moddb.com/games/stalker-call-of-pripyat/mods?sort=rating-desc\n\n\n\nOverall 8.5/10\nIt's easily in my top 5\nExploring the hazardous lands and scavenging through abandoned buildings with aggressive wildlife never gets old.\nThis is a true PC game ( not ported, bad optimized or locked at 30fps and weird controls. not that junk we see today)\nIf you liked the others stalkers this is a must\nor this type of game i recommend Metro series.\n\n\n\n\n\nsorry about errors/bad spelling, english isn't my main language","November 26, 2013","true","300.2"," 454 of 477 people (95%) found this review helpful","95","454","477","0","12"

A wave of hope passed over me. The Zone was cruel, unforgiving, and merciless. With the sky growing darker every second, the tension and anxiety building up, I made the final sprint to the Skadovsk. It was difficult to see at this point, with only the silhouettes of dead trees and abandoned machinery to guide my way. My flashlight had ran out of battery, along with my PDA. Navigation was close to impossible. I could feel the Zone closing in, with the sounds of the unnatural creatures this unholy place has birthed echoing in the darkness. I may have a weapon - however, it was badly damaged, and my single magazine of ammunition wouldn't do me much good, as my gun was unreliable and often jammed or malfunctioned. No prayer could change the fact that I was a walking meal for these creatures. Creatures, whose shimmering eyes you could see in the distance with no visible body, speeding across your vision. Whatever unnatural cloaking the Zone has given them, they could attack from any direction. I wasn't going to let them get that chance. The Skadvosk was near, now. I'm getting exhausted. I'm hungry. I'm thirsty. I had used my last bandage after getting shot by a bandit, if I wanted to survive, I had to get inside. Just as I approached the gaping hole in the hull of the ship, those piercing yellow eyes appeared in a cluster of dead grass. The eyes that followed me, watching me, waiting for me to slip up before it attacks. It was all I could see, the rest of the world was encompassed in a miserable darkness that could strike fear into a fearless man. Just as I had stepped inside the broken hull, sprinting with my last burst of stamina to the sealed door, ear-piercing shots were heard above me, along with the heart warming Russian insults being directed at the creature that was just hunting me. Stepping in the ship, closing the door behind me, I quickly unloaded my haul to Beard, the bartender and trader. The weight lifted from my shoulders, I purchased some Bread and Vodka with my newly acquired Rubles, and sat around the table, listening to my fellow STALKER's tell the tales of their own Misery.","January 24, 2015","true","22.5"," 205 of 220 people (93%) found this review helpful 27 people found this review funny","93","205","220","27","2"

It takes the core concepts of the original game and pushes them in a direction that allows you to have a little more fun while exploring the brutal representation of a real-life scarred patch of earth.\n\nThe first game had a lot of elements of wanting to go somewhere, but the high radiation levels or heavy enemy resistance prevented it.  CoP opens up the world around you a little more and gives you some more room to do your own thing.\n\nThere are little touches that help crank up the entertainment level as well.  One of my favorites is the randomly occuring "blowouts" that will almost always (without the appropriate inventory items) kill you if you can't find cover in time.  Some of the greatest moments in this game exist when in the middle of a vicious firefight, or at the final moments of a task that has you hurt and running low on supplies, and then a blowout starts rolling in.\n\nGet ready to feel like a badass.

You need to realize this right here, right now.\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R. will ♥♥♥♥ you up. If you think playing Dark Souls or ArmA  prepares you for this game then I'm sorry for you.\n\n\nIn S.T.A.L.K.E.R. you will be thrown into The Zone (some people call it Hell and they have their reasons)  and you will be given an objective. Simple as that.  No tutorial, not any big baby hand-holding cutscene and no magic armor that defends you from everything.\n\nYou are literally one of the most useless things walking around in The Zone and of course the NPCs will treat you like one.  They will try to steal from you, kill you and even ask you if you want to die fast or slowly.  'Make your choice'.\n\nWhat can you do to avoid that? Nothing. It will happen sooner or later because as I said you are the most useless thing in the game.  You will die at least 5 times within the first hour and if you are a dirty casual, you will abandon the game.\n\nIf you want to master this game though, you will continue playing and every time the game beats you up like you were a bag of trash.\n\nSo here are two tips from  an experienced player such as myself:\n\nTip #1 Take your ♥♥♥♥ing time, idiot.\n\nYou do not kill everything you see, because you can't.  You have a better chance waiting for your "friendly" NPCs to kill each other and then go loot their bodies because that's all you can do at the start of the game.   You are pathetic.\n\nSo after you get some nice loot, go sell it in Skadovsk. You do not know what Skadovsk is? Then open the ♥♥♥♥ing wiki and see for yourself. That's how you will play this game from now on. You will learn things from the damn wiki because it's the only place that explains things.\n\nTip #2\n\nDo not go outside during night. I did once, and to this date I still wake up in the middle of the night from the nightmares.\n\nDon't go outside during night, ♥♥♥♥nut.\n\nOverall score:\n\n10/10. And if someone gives it lower than 10,  he is a rookie and Vodka is too strong for him.","June 13, 2015","true","82.4"," 197 of 226 people (87%) found this review helpful 129 people found this review funny","87","197","226","129","16"

Call of Pripyat. A Polished Yet Stark Post Apocalyptic World.Genre: FPS RPG Post-Apocalyptic Horror Open World.\nDeveloped and Published by: GSC Game World\nPlatform: Windows Only.\nBusiness Model: Base Game.\nCopy Purchased by Myself Read the full & unabridged review on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\n\nOverall Gameplay Thoughts\nIf Shadow of Chernobyl was the wild west of the STALKER universe, Call of Pripyat is the "civilized" entry into the series. My immediate impression of the game is that it's much more polished, with refined mechanics and a much more stable world to explore. Its clear that the developers didn't want another buggy Shadow of Chernobyl again. However, there were trade-offs with this approach. Unlike the creepy and danger-around-every-corner feeling that SoC gives you, CoP comes off as a more stark and alien. As if this wasn't Earth anymore. The "living world" that was present in SoC is much more subdued and scaled back in CoP and some mechanics were removed to my disappointment. Despite my disappointments, they didn't overshadow the sheer fun surviving in the Zone. After all, what could possibly be more enjoyable than listening to glorious Russian accents, finding strange anomalies and surviving the mutants of the Exclusion Zone.\n\nCombat Thoughts\nThe game is more complete, better balanced and more variety of weapons no doubt thanks to its focused development cycle. You can also modify your suits and weapons this time around was also a nice change, allowing for a much more RPG-like experience. My favorite gun had to be the railgun you picked up in the later part of the game, the sound from firing it was just too cool. Overall, weapons feel very well balanced and have their own pros, cons and punch to each weapon. Ammo is still pretty limited but there are more merchants to buy from so it's not terribly difficult to keep a good supply on hand. Everything is suitably deadly, requiring you to keep on your toes the entire time.\n\nExploration Thoughts\nExploration in this game is better and more rewarding. There are plenty of interesting areas to look around, people to meet and creepy as heck underground structures to freak out in. I noticed more of the exploration took place out in the zone more than in underground facilities unlike SoC which had several notable X Labs to explore. That being said, there's still a creepy lab or two to get creeped out in.\n\nAtmosphere and the World\nIf there is something to be disappointed about, its the reduction of mechanics from the previous entry. Gone is how epic the A-Life engine felt when creatures roamed the lands and danger was around every possible corner. That sense of risk evaporated. In SoC, you could come across battles going on or the aftermath. Also gone are the risks to the NPCs, the zone changing around you on a regular basis with every emission. Any important quest giver won't be killed this time around which I felt was a damn shame. Gone is that sense of continual change that SoC had. In SoC, factions fought each other over land and constant conflicts. When certain events, those factions took advantage of the craze to get into all-out warfare. The Zone feels static now, not as unpredictable as it used to be. It stays put for the majority of the main story. Instead, it goes for more mechanical purity and straightforward experience. I can't blame them for going that route and I'm certainly not going to complain about it being a lot less buggy than CoP. However, I do wish they had taken the A-Life engine to a whole new level rather than step back.\n\nPC Settings & Modding\nCoP is largely clean of bugs in its vanilla state so modding isn't as required as it was in SoC though there is some. The expected PC settings are mostly here though you have to do some modding to open up Field of View options, V-sync and borderless windowed mode. You can find more about that on PCGamingWiki[pcgamingwiki.com]. In game you have a selection of resolution options, quality options, full screen on/off and sliders for gamma, contrast and brightness. Advanced options include vision distance, object detail, texture detail, anisotropic filtering, antialiasing, grass detail density, lighting distance, and shadow quality sliders. In fact, there's almost nothing you can't tweak and change in the advanced graphics options. Everything from SSAO modes to volumetric light to NPC flashlights, there's a crazy amount of choices to optimize your experience. CoP is the best optimized game of the lot too so your computer shouldn't have too much trouble running it. There's only two audio sliders this time around for SFX and music which is a bit limited. Key rebinding and secondary keys are also supported.\n\nFinal Thoughts\nThe S.T.A.L.K.E.R. remains one of the most memorable series I've had the chance to play. The journey has been exciting, terrifying and challenging all at the same time. Call of Pripyat is the least buggy and better overall game of the series. But, I feel it loses that sense of risk that Shadow of Chernobyl took, instead going for a more standard open world experience. It's still incredibly compelling compared to most open worlds though. I still want to return to the Zone again and tackle it again. Which is pretty rare for me to want to do with most open world games. What can I say, it's a unique series. Its tragic that the development studio closed its doors. While GSC has been rumored to return, I'm doubtful that we will see another STALKER game again. I definitely recommend this game if you're into the FPS, RPG and post-Apocalyptic type titles such as these. Despite all of its flaws and quirks, the experience is well worth taking head-on.\n\nRead this review and more on A Paladin Without A Crusade[kingisaaclinksr.com]\nA Paladin's Review: S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Shadow of Chernobyl","November 25, 2013","true","40.4"," 105 of 114 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","105","114","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mutant1988/recommended/41700/","Mutant1988","Mutant1988","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Mutant1988/","271 products in account","An absolutely amazing game with an incredibly oppressive and bleak atmosphere. Following the Chernobyl catastrophe, there was another explosion in the Chernobyl exclusion zone, an explosion that left the surrounding environment altered in ways that defy scienfitic explanation. The area is now filled to the brim with deadly physics defying anomalies, countless pockets of radiation and incredibly lethal mutants. The area is simply referred to as "The Zone".\n\nThose that explore the zone, in search of valuable artifacts spawned from the mysterious anomalies, are called Stalkers. You are one of them. Or rather, you pose as one.\n\nYou are in fact a Ukranian army major, covertly entering the zone to investigate a lost helicopter squadron sent in to conduct reconnaissance in the zone. To accomplish your mission, you need to make allies with other stalkers and with their aid make your way towards the city of Pripyat and find out what exactly happened to the helicopters and their crews.\n\nOf course, there's also hostile humans to contend with, ranging from bandits, brain fried zombies (Still capable of using their guns) and foreign mercenaries. You also have some degree of choice in which faction to align yourself with and every side mission you complete (Or don't) have an impact on the epilogue endings of the game. It is very much worth it to complete every side mission, for that reason but also because a lot of the best moments in the game happen during them.\n\nThe game is very survival focused, with a large emphasis on resource and inventory management. It also has a hunger mechanic, which adds flavor without in any way becoming overbearing. There's a real time passage of time (At a factor of 1 minute per 3 seconds or so), various weather conditions and there's also recurring "Emissions", which are essentially storms that turn the entire world red and fry your brain unless you take cover inside a solid structure.\n\nThere's quite a lot of weapons and armors to acquire and many ways to upgrade them to improve your survivability. You can also equip artifacts to boost various attributes, like improved healing rate, increased endurance or resistance against radiation.\n\nI personally find that the equipment progression curve is a bit uneven, with the player finding equipment early on that's good to stick with nearly all the way to the end game. The feeling of being outmatched and outgunned, which was prevalent for a large part of the first two games, is much rarer in this installment. That's not to say that the game is easy, because it certainly isn't. Later in the game, you very much want to stick to the biggest guns you've got and bring as much armor piercing ammunition as you can.\n\nBut it lacks the initial desperation, trying to scrounge for decent gear, which made the beginning of the first two games so frustrating, but also exciting. This also has the effect of making pistols somewhat useless, which is a shame, because there is quite a few of them. But, as far as the story is concerned, it makes sense to not have terrible equipment from the outset.\n\nThis is still the best installment in the series, due to it's gameplay refinements and focus on a handful of large open areas rather than multiple smaller maps. I do however think the environment design of the first game is superior, but it's entirely possible that that is simply nostalgia speaking. I just felt that each area in the first game introduced something new, while the 3 large areas of Call of Prypyat feel a bit more sparse and predictable. I do miss the beginners area of the Cordon (Rookie Village, Railway Bridge), the claustrophobic streets. alleys and railways of the Wild Territory (Exploring this in a thunderstorm is amazing), the absolutely terrifying Bloodsucker village and the city of Pripyat itself (And the locations you find there).\n\nReally, what I'm saying is play all of them.","March 22, 2015","true","81.4"," 55 of 55 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","55","55","0","0"
"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Syntax-Error/recommended/41700/","Syntax-Error","Syntax Error","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Syntax-Error/","1198 products in account","The sequel to Shadow of Chernobyl, Call of Pripyat does an excellent job of adding to the previous game's mechanics and making it a smoother experience.  Issues from Shadow of Chernobyl such as item repair are now included without needing mods and other aspects are changed such as artifact hunting and a degree of neutrality with other factions (such as mercenaries and bandits).  The game is perhaps more open world than SoC and the side quests are much more intuitive.   Most importantly, the game retains much of its original atmosphere and you'll continue to explore the decaying wastelands of the Exclusion Zone.\n\nWith that said, the game does have some weaknesses.  While it retains that atmosphere that made SoC great, it also (disappointingly) leaves you cut off from much of its namesake town of Pripyat.  Regions you once explored in SoC such as the hotel, government building and the park with its iconic Ferris wheel are now only seen in the distance behind fences.  The buildings you explore instead seem sparser and more linear.  Likewise, human opponents are pretty thin in the game and most of your fighting will be against mutants.  Sure, you CAN just start shooting people on sight but the different factions and uncertain nature of SoC felt much more exhilarating to me and winning against 'human' opponents just felt more gratifying than shooting umpteen mutant dogs and pigs.  Finally, the ending felt rushed to me and less epic than the original breech into the forbidden CNPP.\n\nEven with all that, Call of Pripyat still felt like a worthy successor to Shadow of Chernobyl.  I would definitely recommend that someone new to the series play SoC first but Call of Pripyat will be a satisfying way to remain in the mysterious world of the Exclusion Zone a while longer.  Call of Pripyat played well 'vanilla' without requiring mods (which is more than you can say for the buggy SoC) but there are multiple well crafted mods to dramatically change the world and keep things interesting for a long time to come.  Shadow of Chernobyl was a tough act to follow and Call of Pripyat made it most of the way there; a recommended purchase in my book.","September 29, 2014","true","49.9"," 57 of 58 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","57","58","0","0"

I've always liked the weapon physics in the Stalker series.  Its a bit tougher to be accurate whether ADS or from the hip.  And some of the creature noises just make my hair follicles bristle.  Some creepy stuff, but not so intensely as to be truly horrific (imo).  Stupid snorks!  I felt engaged in the story, driven to "save" (for instance) all my squad when going through the tunnels to Pripyat.  Losing one of them was unacceptable.  Trading with the good guy, "Beard" instead of "Owl" whenever possible ... and always dissing "Sultan's" team of bandits.\n\nI'd really recommend playing the game a second time 'round with a different weapon setup.  Get clever with saves so as to purchase the special weaps and armour from "Nimble" that you'd favour.\n\nThen play again on the "Misery" mod.  Despite having played CoP at least 4 times through --yes I've lost count-- trying "Misery" mod was enjoyable because of the difficulty.\n\nI wonder where the dev team is now ... ?  I thought they were working on another post-apocalyptic adventure for me! ... a loyal supporter of the franchise.  :D","October 7, 2014","true","746.3"," 57 of 62 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","57","62","0","23"

That is, a living world that can, and will, probably kill you. Alot. But more importantly, especially with the MISERY mod, the Zone feels like the type of place that will go on with or without you.

Extremely compelling, fun to explore, and just plain awesome. Also, many of the game's locations are very close to real-life locations in the zone, and they look impressively authentic when you compare photos to screenshots (which I absolutely love).\n\nThere are less side quests, but they are individually larger, more interesting, and better thought out than all the mini-side-quests in STALKER: SoC. The interface is also much improved from previous STALKERs, highlighting matching ammo when you mouse over a gun, for example. There aren't as many stashes, but the stashes in CoP can be found without knowing where they are beforehand. Artifact rarity is handled the best in CoP, compared to SoC (too plentiful and easy to get) and Clear Sky (nearly impossible to get). Emissions and equipment upgrades are the best in the series here, as well.\n\nThe story of CoP is very loose, to let you do whatever you want in whatever order you want, though it's not nearly as good as the story of the original SoC. The game's ending is similar in style to that of Fallout, where it shows you short clips about people and places in the game, telling you what happens to them afterwards. I felt like it was an epic and satisfying end to the trilogy. Ironically, though, the Pripyat area of the game was the worst in terms of well-thought-out-edness in story, dialogue, and missions/quests. Pripyat is, on the other hand, really awesome because the entire area is closely moddled after the Eastern section of real-life Pripyat, with the only major difference being that a service center building is in the game where a kindergarten building is in real life (that, and all the impassible "video game fences" around the edges of the in-game area).\n\nThere is a very active modding community for the game, as well. My favorite mod for Call of Pripyat is 'SGM', which adds a ton of content and improves the graphics.\n\nAwesome game. highly recommended if you like survival FPS games.","December 9, 2014","true","81.1"," 40 of 41 people (98%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","98","40","41","0","2"

The first two were on normal and the hardest difficulty but that just wasnt enough for me so i went and installed the MISERY mod to get the real ball busting experience.\n\nHow does one describe the greatest game ever made? is it the story? the world building? the game mechanics? the difficulty and responsibilities the game gives you to manage? the innumerable ways to play the game?  For all of those questions i would tell you to look no further than the Stalker franchise.  If ever a game was to be the flag ship of PC gaming THIS is the game that people should look at in reverence and awe.\n\nGames of today hold your hand, coddle you and all but tube feed you because they dont trust you to anything intelligent  with their property....no mods, tutorials for everything and a streamlined experience so that nobody strays too far from the course like some sort of amusement park ride.  The Stalker games fly in the face of all of that and rewards you for being different and when everything that can go wrong does...finding your own way to survive in the Zone.\n\nFinding secret stashes, managing your limited resources,  risking your life in Anomolies (elemental effects like acid, fire, wind and the like) and doing perilous quests that arent for the foolhardy.  You arent John Rambo and you dont run around with a fully automatic LMG shooting wildly like in most modern games. This game cements my love and facination with the true Survival Horror games like the original Resident Evil series before they started taking steroids.\n\nYou are just one man with fear in his heart, a deathgrip on your ♥♥♥♥♥♥ beaten up shotgun, a dream of seeing a rusted ship you call home and only a fistfull of shotgun shells to guide your way back in pitch black darkness.\n\nThis game is the most liberating feeling knowing that your life is in your hands and at any moment a mutant could two shot you from behind.....you live by the ability to stay level headed and just how many rounds you have left in your gun(s).   This game is my pride and joy please at least try playing it its well worth $20.\n\nSee you in the Zone, Stalker...","January 12","true","607.5"," 33 of 33 people (100%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","100","33","33","5","0"

I sold my aritfacts, because apparently I could find millions of them and 97% of them were basically Ruble magnets rather than useful, but I didn't complain, then we set out and it happened....\n\nBloodsuckers, this horrible beasts that looked like Liza Manelli except the face looked like it was put through a meat grinder, ugly they were, uglier than Donald Trump's hair!

Then they disappeared out of thin air, leaving a horrendous odor that would've made a burning tire dump smell like a rose garden.\n\nTo this day, I never leave safety without my anti-bloodsucker underwear.\n\nAlright seriously this is a good game, as many people before stated it's got a great atmosphere and sound along with original music. My most loved gem about Call of Pripyat is that it captured my imagination of how Pripyat is now.

In an age when developers are churning out massed produced rubbish designed to grab your money and run after 6 hours worth of banal gameplay ..... Stalker despite its flaws ( including constant stutter that you wont get rid of no matter how hard you try ) remains a classic, atmospheric, masterwork shooter .... add the Misery mod and experience some of the most intense gunfights you will ever see in a game.

And so, GSC — it just that young man who was successful in a feat only from the third attempt. Having restrained an ardor and having managed to find internal harmony, developers at last achieved the desirable. You shouldn't wait for any scenario revelations: in "Call of Pripyat" the plot, as well as in all other games of a series, is interesting only to the convinced admirers of a setting. The main reason for which people play "Stalker" — opportunity to plunge in dangerous, thrown, the world impregnated with melancholy and despondency in which, it seems, still life quite recently boiled.

The developer was inspired by FEAR in terms of AI in battles: the enemies flank you, sneak up on you, take cover, give commands.\n\nBut this is not just an FPS, it is also an RPG, and HOLY CRAP! if this aint the best RPG out there, then please let me know! Thus, the AI extends outside of combat. Monsters travel in packs and engage in fights with other monsters and humans for survival's sake. If the fight seems to be in their favor, they will engage, otherwise they will fall back and move along. Squads of stalkers patrol the Zone: sometimes to defend their base, sometimes to recapture a point. Sometimes it's just one greedy stalker trying to retrieve an artifact from an anomaly so that he can sell it later.\n\nAnd that's another thing about this game: artifacts and their anomaly counterparts. You see, this is the Zone. Radiation has chnaged many things, not just animals and humans. You will find these mini puzzles with an expensive artifact as a reward. Sometimes it's a timed electricity trap. Sometimes it's a gravitational anomaly that holds the ground and water up in the air in an unnatural fashion.\n\nMarketing is killing the gaming industry nowadays. Sales people push developers to improve on graphics and numbers: more DLC, more weapons, more maps, more more more. And it seems like everyone has forgotten the other ingredients that make a game good. Such as AI.\n\nIf you haven't played this game yet, buy it now! I have spent most of my time playing STALKER: Clear Sky (cheaper), which puts more emphasis on factional warfare. But as far as I can tell, this one is just as good, if not better.","May 2","true","19.1"," 19 of 20 people (95%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","95","19","20","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/PutridMeat/recommended/41700/","PutridMeat","PutridMeat","http://steamcommunity.com/id/PutridMeat/","215 products in account","Here's to a Good Day's Work.\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat = Fallout + Deus Ex + Ukrainians\n\nI know I'm rather late to this radioactive party, but I've finally revisted the Zone.\n\nFor those not in the know, Stalker is an FPS dystopic horror that is known for its open world exploration, scary mutants, and almost-RPG aspects.  This is the logical sequel to the first game, Shadow of Chernobyl, but you don't really need to have played the first to enjoy this one.\n\nCall of Pripyat is set in a post-Chernobyl disaster area, the Exclusion Zone or just "The Zone".  Although it's forbidden for anyone to enter, fortune-seeking scavengers known as "Stalkers" regularly find their way in to this cess pool of rust, mutants, and otherwordly death-traps known as "Anomolies".  They do this mostly to dig up "Artifacts", strange new types of matter that display all manner of bizarre and potentially useful phenomenon, which fetch a high price in the scientific, black, and black scientific markets.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics are a good blend of open-world scavenger hunts and solid shooter mechanics.  There are a wide variety of traditional weapons to use that often feature multiple ammo types, fire modes, and optional attachments.  One would think that with new Artifact-based tech, you might find more exotic weapons as well, but other than a slight exception toward the end-game, you won't find any gravity guns or psy-grenades here.\n\nI say that this game is an almost-RPG simply due to the fact that, despite not having attributes or XP points, there is still a "grind" flow to the gameplay and a sort of character progression through acquiring gear, artifacts, and equipment upgrades.\n\nThere is a main mission to follow, which I found mostly uninspired, and a few side missions, which I found much more intriguing.  However, most of your time will be spent simply heading out to points of interests to dig up artifacts and scavenge useful or valuable items from the dead.  Then you will head back to safety when you need to take shelter from the intermittent deadly storms called "Emissions" and/or to sell your loot.  Rinse, repeat.  Fortunately, the game is full of interesting environments, fun shooting mechanics, and a variety of enemies that use a lot of different tactics and abilities to kill you.\n\nEnter the Zone if you...\n\nPlayed and enjoyed the first game.  Although I feel CoP lacks the scope, mystery, and even some of the scariness of the original, this is offset by better mechanics and overall polish.  Both are great and if you enjoy one you will likely want to play the other.\n\nLove post-apocalyptic themes and environments.  CoP is full of bizarre mutants, rusted out ruins, and unearthly anomaly areas.\n\nLike yourself a good open-world shooter.  This is one of the shining stars of the genre.\nHead back to the Cordon if you...\n\nPrefer on-rails, level-based shooter gameplay.  Stalker requires a far more methodical approach if you want to avoid getting killed over and over.\n\nHate "gritty" settings.  For all the sci-fi of the Anomalies, mutants, and artifacts, the Zone is otherwise a bleak landscape of swamps, crumbled concrete, and rust.  I think it is beautiful in it's own way, but I know it's not everyone's cup of Dogolov.\n\nWant more RPG mechanics.  Stalker is definitely a shooter first before anything else.  It is no Borderlands, for example.\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAs a fan of the original, I loved this game and in my first run through I racked up about 60 hours.  I found that most of this time was spent hoarding gear and supplies I'd never really use, however.  Where some missions were rather difficult (such as getting through the tunnel to Pripyat without losing anyone), I found that the endgame seemed almost an afterthought.  There was little reason to explore most of the areas in Pripyat, with only a handful of missions actually requring that you do so.  With a complete arsenal of fully upgraded armor, kitted out weapons, and thousands upon thousands of rounds of the best ammo, I found finishing the last few missions an absolute breeze.  Although this was a bit of a let down, I still enjoyed the experience overall and enjoyed how the ending elaborated on the outcome of many of my choices througout the side-missions.\n\n:::!!!PROTIP PROTIP PROTIP!!!:::\n\nThere are a couple of important mods for this game now-a-days.  At a minimum I'd suggest getting Call of Pripyat: Complete, which overhauls the graphics and makes other great changes to the base game while still keeping it mostly similar to the original experience.\n\nIf you really want to ramp of the difficulty and immersion, there is also the Misery Mod, which puts an emphasis on harsh survival and is probably the most popular mod for the game.","January 22","true","63.2"," 17 of 17 people (100%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","100","17","17","2","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/MonikaWeiss/recommended/41700/","MonikaWeiss","Monika "I.Q." Weiss","http://steamcommunity.com/id/MonikaWeiss/","149 products in account","Crawling through a filthy, mutant-infested basement 20 metres below the surface of an irradiated Ukrainian wasteland, clutching a seen-better-days Kalashnikov while my Geiger counter rattles ominously, I stop to wonder why I actually enjoy S.T.A.L.K.E.R. so much.\nBecause, for one thing, it's hideously bleak. Playing more than an hour or so of any of the games in the series is like spending a month in Somerfield. Before long, murdering a total stranger with a hand grenade seems pragmatic rather than craven. He might have a bottle of vodka. Even the most picturesque of sunsets comes tainted with the knowledge that, shiveringly, they mostly come out at night. Mostly.\nAnd that's where something else I don't usually really enjoy comes in: the unremitting terror. It's the noises. The skittering. The lowing. The moans. The snuffling growls which sound like an angry, adenoidal walrus mating at the bottom of a well (another familiar Somerfield experience). They're terrifying.\nIt's never silent in the world of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.. Even during the lulls in action, which are actually much more common than the desperately-fighting-for-your-life bits, there's always the ragged wind and the caws of the wheeling crows providing a unsettling auditory rug, ready to be whisked from underneath your sense of safety by the slightest hint of a grizzle, groan or gunshot.\nThe sudden snarling of a pseudo-dog, barrelling from cover as I sneak across a pitch-black, anomaly-strewn bluff, is a typically pulse-thrashing moment. 20 seconds later, when the roar of my drum-fed shotgun has abated and the beast lies dead in the clinical glare of my night-vision, I've collected myself enough to rationalise the fact that it's just a dog.\nA mutated, highly aggressive dog with the ability to psychically project a pack of terrifying ghost buddies, yes, but a dog nonetheless. In the Zone, this sort of thing is a minor inconvenience, but that doesn't stop me jumping out of my seat.\nThis tension, crafted so beautifully from the gloomy materials of the game's fractured landscape - its bestial, hypnagogic foes and the tenderly coddled supply of medicine, ammunition and equipment in your backpack - is a part of S.T.A.L.K.E.R. so intrinsic that it's become something of a one-word strapline for the series. Atmosphere.\nEvery dark and foreboding basement, every foetid and festering tunnel, each chattering, Learian, wind-blasted moor is pregnant with the potential for sudden and terrifying action. S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s environments seethe with sinister malevolence, despite being largely uninhabited.\nThe scarcity of foes - when traversing the topside environments, you'll only need your weapon once every few minutes - is completely necessary to this balance. Familiarity breeds contempt, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R.'s enemies are scattered enough to maintain their mysterious malice, just sneaky and sly enough to make your imagination teem with invisible Bloodsuckers and grim-faced Burer.\nCuriously, human on human violence has been toned down considerably for the latest game, Call of Pripyat. The much-vaunted but never perfected system of factions has all but disappeared, reduced to a token discord between the hippy-go-lucky Freedom and their young Republican Duty counterparts.\nEven the Bandits have calmed down enormously, chatting away to you and each other for the most part (and dependent upon your actions, of course). It's a strange choice, because often in both Clear Sky and the original Shadow of Chernobyl humans were some of the deadliest foes you would encounter.\nThere are still plenty of folks with radioactive chips on their shoulders, mind you, and there a few, like the fanatical space-cadet Monolith, who will attack you on sight, but generally the Zone has become an altogether more humanitarian place. If you approach a group of human enemies, even with the telltale red crosshairs and everything, they'll probably just tell you to get lost, warning you to holster your weapon well before they start shooting. Ignore their clemency and you'll soon be choking on a hot lead butty, but it's a definite change of pace.\nIt works, though. Clear Sky's constant re-zoning and pitched open warfare was too much too deal with and needed reining in, and Call of Pripyat has it pretty much nailed. The A-life system does all it is expected to do, and indeed all it promised as well. Mutants scuffle among themselves and with the regular patrols of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s and bandits who wander around, and dogs or Flesh can often be seen dragging bodies away. Human parties are plentiful, looting corpses and searching for artefacts in the game's large-scale anomalies.\nThese giant anomalies are pretty much the only place you'll find the valuable, stat-boosting artefacts, which retain their invisibility from Clear Sky and so require detectors to be found. They've evolved from the collections of smaller hazards that they were, too - becoming huge rents in the earth or giant, twisted organic structures glittering with acid or flame. Exploring them with a detector in one hand and a pistol in the other is a tense experience, simultaneously made vulnerable by lack of firepower and proximity to danger.","October 11, 2015","true","0.5"," 16 of 17 people (94%) found this review helpful 5 people found this review funny","94","16","17","5","0"

I am returning to this series every year. Already finished series 13x except Clear Sky... maybe 4 times, because that prologue is just boring and do not compare to Shadow of Chernobyl and Call of Pripyat.\n\nVery solid survival horror with its own special feeling to it. Exploring the Zone around Chernobyl with all its mutants, bandits, Stalkers, anomalies and really dangerous types of mutant creatures is a real pleasure. I heavily enjoyed the difficult and realism of the Misery mod. (Stalker difficulty level recommended people that play the series for the first time)\n\nEvery year I am playing series with a diffrent mix of mods. If You are going to play it for the first time, play vanilla game, once You finish YOU HAVE TO APPLY ONE OF THE BEST MODS: Enchanced Environment Mod, Complete Mod, Misery Mod! And this is just for Call of Pripyat! Every mod has something unique to offer! You will experience game like never before, even though You finished the game. These mods just make the game fresh all over again!\n\nThanks to the Modders we are going to experience COOP CAMPAIGN SOON. Isn't that crazy?! The coop mod is called "Ray Of Hope" and this mod does not introduce just a coop campaign. ♥♥♥♥♥, please. THEY ADD BRAND NEW OPEN WORLD MAP, REBALANCED AI AND MORE! So if You are a hardcore fan of such challenging survival games like me, YOU HAVE TO BUY THE GAME. This series is just the pure perfection in survival genre. THIS IS HOW ALL OTHER GAMES SHOULD BE.\n\nDayZ? H1Z1? Miscreated? They all are a bullsh*t. Developers are laughing ♥♥♥ of You paying them for these games, especially for "FREE 2 PLAY SOON" H1Z1.

While the main storyline is noticeably more bland than in SoC, the side stories in all three of the main locations and the related quests more than make up for it. Increasing the size and decreasing the number of the main locations has been a wise decision, and while maybe a bit less varied in features, they are still rich enough. The re-worked survival, combat, anomaly, artifact and weapon customization systems all contribute to a much smoother and rewarding gameplay while the quests that involve going "off the grid" and often underground still ensure the teeth-rattling, creepy experience you all loved in SoC.","December 27, 2013","true","87.8"," 11 of 12 people (92%) found this review helpful","92","11","12","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/Crack_Rock_Steady/recommended/41700/","Crack_Rock_Steady","Pre-School Prostitute","http://steamcommunity.com/id/Crack_Rock_Steady/","250 products in account","Decided to re-write this review since I don't have a limit on characters now, I don't think.\n\nAnyway, STALKER Call of Pripyat is the 3rd game of the STALKER series and in the order of chronology, it falls in last (the first being Clear Sky, the second being Shadow of Chernobyl). STALKER is a survival semi-RPG FPS game that requires you to focus on multiple areas at once. Eating, weapon and armor management, inventory management, etc. The series is loosely based on the book Roadside Picnic by Boris and Arkady Strugatsky, although there are many differences. The act of searching for artifacts in an exclusion Zone is there, but the rest of the story is vastly different. Call of Pripyat's story, in particular, has almost nothing to do with the book. You play as USS Major Alexander Degtyarev, who is sent into the Zone following a failed mission conducted by the military to essentially map out the Zone for a full-scale military assault on the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (CNPP). The game starts out with a cutscene that lasts maybe 5 or so minutes to give you backstory and such, and then thrusts you into the zone with bare essentials: food, bandages, first aid, and a couple guns with ammo. From there on, you're on your own. The game expects you to figure things out yourself and doesn't really outright tell you what to do. This is either exciting to you or a put off, depending on who you are. For me, it was refreshing. The first thing I did was walk up to a couple stalkers after I spawned and asked them where the nearest settlement was. They point to Skavodsk and you head there for more work. STALKER does a good job inducing a feeling of Isolation by putting you in wide open areas with very few people to be seen, except around settlements. Even then, the stalkers in these settlements will occasionally head out to gather supplies, hunt, artifact search, or just duke it out amongst themselves, so you'll find Skavodsk empty at times, aside from the merchants.\nSTALKER is also one of the most immersive games for me. The combination of music, ambience, and the general loneliness is so well done that it's hard to turn the game off. In Pripyat especially, there's a feeling of paranoia, as the background ambience includes whispering and quiet, soft chattering in Russian, so it always feels as if someone is nearby, and you don't know if they're friend or foe. One complaint that I have for the game is the English voice actors being really bad and making the game seem sillier than it really is. However, this can be fixed by downloading a Russian voice pack mod and english subtitle mod (I don't understand why these features weren't included to begin with but I'm glad the mods exist).\nSpeaking of mods, there are several mods that make the game even better. Complete, MISERY, Atmosfear and many other mods all manage to make the game more immersive, difficult, fun, beautiful and overall great. Some problems with the base game are the glitches and crashes that occur, but with some mods, some of these glitches are nonexistent, although some still remain. I highly recommend playing CoP with mods.\nSTALKERs mutants are also something to be addressed in themselves. There are mutants galore in the STALKER games. From the mostly docile Flesh, to the hulking Pseudo-Giant, to the mind bending Controller, every mutant is unique, and requires their own set of tactics in order to make it out in one piece.\n\nThere's so many things I'd love to talk about in STALKER. I can't possibly put them all in one review. All I can say is buy the game and find out for yourself just how well made this game was, and how much love was put into it. Here's hoping bitComposer can help get STALKER 2 off the ground, and Survarium is just as good.","February 7, 2014","true","72.9"," 10 of 11 people (91%) found this review helpful","91","10","11","0","0"

This is the best of all three games technically, but it's not better than the first in terms of mood. Maybe that's just because Shadow of Shernobyl was the first one I played, I don't know. If you like FPS and RPGs, and think that the odd relationship between Call of Duty, Fallout and Penumbra should result in a cool ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, genetically threesomely impossible, ucranian child, you will fall in love with this gem of a series. They are cheap even in full price, I asure you.\n\nAnd one more thing: I am a HUGE fan of Fallout series (but yeah I prefer the original. More Mad Max and less America ♥♥♥♥ Yeah than the PFS ones, but still) but S.T.A.L.K.E.R is better. You shoot, your bullet has a parabolic trajectory, it hits the head, the enemy dies. No "5 hits in the head because ♥♥♥♥ realism and fun, ATRIBUTES AND MATH!!!" If there is an enemy around, you see it. No "I can't see because of a calculation between atributes and random enconter generator" or anything. Of course, this is a matter of taste.\n\nAlso, this game is almost bug free (it was 100% vanilla bug free in my playthough, at least).

A Post-Apocoliptic hell-on-earth. Radioactive anomalies and crazed mutant creatures. Oh yeah, and the odd bandit raid and zombie attack. Your travel agent is a ♥♥♥♥♥, unless you are Major Degretev ( I just mispelled that), a USS oprative sent in to investiagate a failed operation to the Zone. In which you discover the nature and the sheer disructive power that is the excusion zone around Chyernobl.\n\nGameplay 9/10. A solid method to a well filled nitch, some will find it similar to Fallout exept it is not 100% rediculus, also the artifact hunting is a cornestone of the game in its story and its economy.\n\nGraphics 8/10. Good for a game of this type, however I don't recommend cranking the graphics to 10 unless you have a good rig.\n\nStory 9/10. It is hard to mix story and  non-linear gameplay, but they did a good job encorpeating it.\n\nRealism 2/10. Yes I actually made this a catagory on which I grade. This, like many other FPS games are the same. You can somehow walk out into a hail of bullets in an overcoat and somehow come out on the other side and laugh. Also if any of you have burn yourself on the oven taking something out, that is about 500 degrees F, a fire anomaly here is 1000 degrees C, and you can pitch a tent there for how long you can make it before taking  a decent amount of damage.\nAnother thing to know, none of the weapons in this game have their real names, ex Martha is the name for an M9.\n\nOverall a good game which is short on realism and difficulty, which is fine. For anybody that thinks the Zone is too warm and cuddly for you, I deeply recommend the Misery mod. It is a full concept modification that changes and enhances, well every aspect of the game. As far as graphics are concerndmore contrast and darker colors, while taking the definetion up a notch or three. ( Do not attempt a high or even mid graphics if you have a low end rig). And for gameplay and realism. Well I'm not sure if you noticed, but it is called Misery for a reason. Most will spend a few hours on it and rage quit if they do it for their first playthrough, so don't. Get some COP playing on master under your belt before playing.

There is so much openness and discovery to this game. It's a rediculously good game. The first person perspective adds a lot to the game. There are things you always have to worry about such as radiation and my biggest enemy and fear.... the emission. You will learn more about them when you play. This game tries to be a rpg,fps, openworld game and has a great deal of horror to it as well. When this game goes nighttime, it REALLY goes nighttime so a flashlight is very necessary.

CoP is great and if you use some graphics style mods for it, the looks are quite nice for a game this age.  Least is Clear Skys though SoC (Shadow of Chernobyl) has the most diverse endings possible, it's rather cryptic to play.\n\nGame play wise, it's wicked - you can and will get munched by things if you don't pay close attention to details.  I do like how when you hear things, like barking dogs or growls, you'll jump (almost nothing you hear is "friendly").  The story is decent and the play moves at your pace with plenty of open world feel to it.\n\nDownside:  No wait function and sleeping is only at certain times/places.  That gets annoying when you sure as hell aren't interested in going out in the dark/foggy weather in nasty areas or when you need to wait a couple game-hours for a mission.\n\nSome modes (and there are a few) help out a bit - especially graphics style mods for visuals but I'd avoid them until you've done a playthrough first. My personal favorites are Atmosfear and Absolute Nature for looks.","December 7, 2013","true","232.1"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

I have to find a notebook containing their plans and then return to Owl with the intel.\n\nI am heavily outnumbered and outgunned. If I pick a fight with anyone, I'm dead. If I get spotted, I'm dead before I can get out the door, let alone the compound. Where is the notebook? Somewhere upstairs, I'm sure.\n\nIt's so dark I can't see anything immediately around me but the handrail of the staircase silhouetted against the fading daylight from outside. I can't risk using my flashlight. Hugging the deep shadow against the wall, I crouch and move silently. There's the notebook! Got it! Now to get out.\n\nCan I sneak out the same way I sneaked in? I can. I pick up a jerry can of fuel as a bonus on the way out. Not a shot fired (and just as well because ammo is expensive). Who says stealth is dead? Not me! I stop to eat before starting back, just in case I need some energy to sprint for safety.\n\nI almost make it back to the Shadovsk when I'm ambushed by a pack of mutants charging from behind. Just Flesh, so easy to handle. Mission accomplished. I'll head back to  the WPS later when I'm better armed and can hold my own against the mercs: right now I need the money that intel will get me.\n\nNo hand holding. No follow the NPC leader. No warnings of any kind of impending death. Just me and the Zone.\n\nI had heard the S.TA.L.K.E.R. series was solid (and was already a Metro 2033 fan) so I bought Call of Pripyat on sale but then it sat there in my Steam library, neglected while I played other newer games. And then I heard about the Misery Mod. It sounded hard. It sounded scary. It looked fantastic. Misery 2.1 is cruelty ratcheted up several notches to the level of sadomasochism.\n\nRun out of medkits? You die. Miss your headshot and don't duck back into cover fast enough? You die. Forget to pop an antiradiation pill? You watch your health slowly bleed out (and then you get into a firefight). It is just the most awesome, scary, thrilling and realistic gaming experience I've ever had.\n\nIf you want to experience a game that is as brutal as if you were in the irradiated zone around Chernobyl in real life, Misery Mod 2.1.1 is it.\n\nUPDATE: Heading out from base, whether in Zaton, Jupiter or Pripyat, equipped and loaded for a day in the Zone of Alienation (I have now been freeplaying Misery as a Recon for hundreds of hours) not knowing whether I'm going to encounter mercs or bandits, bloodsuckers or chimeras, wondering if I'm going to locate a new stash (136+ looted so far) or just find a new ledge I can climb onto, or even acquire an unknown 23rd artifact type to add to my collection: every day in the Zone is a joy, an adrenaline rush, and a meditation on the beauty of the maps and excellent gameplay that the developers and modders created.\n\nIf I were shipwrecked on a desert island (with my PC and a power source) this would be the game I would want with me.","May 11, 2014","true","949.8"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","1"

The Call of Pripyat Complete mod does volumes to improve upon the look and feel of this game, although without the mod I'd still say the game is damn near perfect like any of the other S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games. However, compared to the other games I felt like this game was... smaller... mostly because there didn't seem to be as much territory to explore. The story also seemed to be lacking a bit after playing SoC, which had an incredible story to it. They made it work though with plenty to do! I'm a huge fan of both the Fallout series and the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, and although I spend way more time on Fallout, I have to admit S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a way better RPG (if one can even consider Fallout to be an RPG).","May 3","true","19.9"," 7 of 8 people (88%) found this review helpful","88","7","8","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/woundedkneecap3/recommended/41700/","woundedkneecap3","Jazzy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/woundedkneecap3/","204 products in account","Most people love this game for the extreme atmosphere. It's probably the best example "post-apocalyptic" without actually being post-apocalyptic. The STALKER series takes place near and in Pripyat, Ukraine. In this world, the 1986 Chernobyl disaster released a magical and anomalous effect in the surrounding area named "The Zone". Outside of The Zone, the world continues as normal, however adventure and fortune seeking individuals smuggle themselves into the Zone to acquire artifacts, anomalous objects that are often used in and outside the zone for their beneficial properties, such as absorbing radiation or regenerating health.\n\nI'm sure you can read more about the world of STALKER in another review or on the wiki page. For this game, you're playing as guy sent into the Zone to investigate crashed helicopters. Your can also go on side-quests given to you by various fractions. Some of these quests are time limited once you accept them, so don't pile on a ton like you would in Skyrim.\n\nThe combat in this game is pretty fun. You're far from a bullet sponge, specially in your basic armor. Firefights with bandits and other humans requires hit-and-run tactics, and taking hits causes blood loss which can be stopped with medkits and bandages. The Zone's monsters range from four-legged beasts that charge at you, zombies that are surprisingly accurate with their firearms, various humanoid creatures that leap long distances or attempt to control the minds of you and people around you.\n\nThe graphics are dated and the firearm animations are janky; however, this game series has rather productive modding community. Check out hubs like /r/stalker on reddit for lists of popular mods (including the popular MISERY mod that dramatically increases difficulty).\n\nOne thing to note, this game has more text than dialog. Most of it is optional, but on my first playthrough, I was blindly following map markers, not really knowing why I was doing the things tasked to me. It greatly detracts from the wonderful atmosphere of this game, so make sure to pay attention and read the text.","June 27, 2015","true","13.2"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","5","5","0","0"

For first time players of this game i heavily reccomend playing on Master off the bat, seriously Easy is just a poorly balanced FPS where you swim in guns and money.\n\nWhile for intermediate users who prefer a challenge, you should try the MISERY mod for S.T.A.L.K.E.R.

Overall the game was brilliant, despite being a tad bit dated I still enjoyed it nonetheless. It was exciting to start without knowing anything about it and then scavenging for artifacts through anomalies. You do quests for the people and in turn they offer you better deals or money. There's quite a bit of medicines to be used(but I never used them) and there's quite a bit of customization with the weapon and armor mods which allow you to adapt your playstyle. I was however disappointed when I reached Pripyat. The zone is very barren, not much to be done and seen. The whole thing is bugged for me, not letting me finish my game and despite having found loopholes around it, I still can't quite finish it. This one part completely ruined the game for me. The Complete Mod for it also seems to be bugged and has negative reviews. I also noticed no more artifacts spawned in anomalous areas after having left Pripyat and went to Zaton/Yanov. Overall I don't think it's worth 20€ in it's state. It's a good game, but requires fixing.\n\n>I'd give it a 7/10(the ending completely ruined it, I'll try to fix it and update the review if possible)\n>Pros: Customization, plenty of quests that affect the ending, perks/achievements, very good atmosphere, fun to discover how the game works and all it's tricks, spooky ambiance with challenging enemies.\n>Cons: Graphical bugs, many other bugs which might make you unable to finish the game or quest, lack of content in the end-game, my artifacts didn't respawn after emissions nor did I have any use for most medicines in the game as all of it was trivial(running through anomalies and healing up afterwards proved to be easier)","June 26, 2015","true","32.0"," 5 of 5 people (100%) found this review helpful 3 people found this review funny","100","5","5","3","0"

I am in love with the STALKER series! I have not finished the two first games, Shadow of Chernobyl and Clear Sky due to annoying bugs, and of course these bugs had to happend at the end right before you go to Chernobyl NPP.... But I learned what happend there from the wiki.\n\nIn Call of Pripyat, you play as the USS Agent Alexander Degtyarev/Major Degtyarev. You have been sent to The Zone undercover to investigate why Operation Fairway failed and what happened to the crew and helicopters. On the way you will meet Stalkers, Mutants, Anomalies and Radiation. Nothing will stop you because you have the power to quicksave! Seriously... quicksave is very important in this game.\n\nHaven't played much of the Vanilla game since it looks like ♥♥♥♥. Have tried out the Complete and MISERY mod. Never finished the story in the Complete mod but I came to the city, Pripyat. The Complete mod is for those who wants a STALKER game with less bugs and better graphics.  Misery is a very difficult mod that adds more realism and better grapichs to STALKER CoP. It's more about survival, and the start can be very tough if you have not played any STALKER games before.\n\nI HIGHLY recommend you to play STALKER with some kind of graphical mod.\n\nPros and Cons\n\nPros\n\n-Good gameplay\n-Best atmosphere\n-Scary\n-Survival (Misery mod)\n-Good story (play the two first games and you will understand more)\n-Quicksave F5\n\nCons\n\n-Bad grapichs (Vanilla)\n-Annoying bugs (Vanilla and mods)\n\nI will recommend this game for gamers who likes RPG, Survival and Action.","February 22, 2015","true","140.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","1"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrytigerp/recommended/41700/","angrytigerp","Angrytiger [USN IRL]","http://steamcommunity.com/id/angrytigerp/","738 products in account","The S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series is one that scratches an itch that many people weren't aware they had, that of a story-based first-person shooter that doesn't skimp on the aspects of character improvement. To be fair, its narrative lacks the strength of an epic such as Half Life, but it makes up for it by presenting a plausible pseudo-scifi flair that doesn't require too much imagination to comprehend. The long and short of it is that, in the area around the Chernobyl catastrophe (known as the "Zone"), radioactive influence has caused the birth of a number of strange anomalies, both helpful and harmful. The former come from 'artifacts', mysterious objects possessing helpful properties like increasing the body's ability to heal, and the latter is in the form of arcane occurrences such as areas where gravity is magnified to a fatal extent, or even things as run-of-the-mill as your typical postapocalyptic creatures seeking to kill you.\n\nWhat sets the STALKER franchise apart is the emphasis on the balance between the fictional nightmares of the Zone and the interactions with other people just like you -- fortune-seekers trying to locate artifacts for their value in the world at large, while avoiding the pitfalls of anomalies and mutants. While these other Stalkers may not be perfectly represented as flesh-and-blood people, it is entirely possible, within the scope of the games, to make alliances with one faction (say, the Bandits who seek fortune for themselves at the expense of others), which would then make others view you as an enemy.\n\nCall of Pripyat is itself the latest (five years old, mind you) expression of the series, bringing together Shadow of Chernobyl (the first game)'s narrative coherence with Clear Sky (the second, oft-panned game)'s factional warfare and open-ended nature. In CoP, you find yourself in an open world, with 3 main maps available to get your Stalker on. There is a centralized story to follow, involving your character as a special operative for the Russian government attempting to track down the cause of the crashes of an entire squad of other operatives, as if flying over the anomaly-filled Zone wasn't reason enough. But within that overall framework, you are free to either maintain your military nature and focus entirely on the mission, or you can go off and become a Stalker yourself, searching for artifacts and misplaced caches of military gear.\n\nAs far as the story goes, it's a pretty linear progression. Each map has a list of things for you to accomplish in the story's progression, and at the end of those things it opens up the way to the next map. It serves a function of allowing you to explore each area, without losing track of the bigger picture always lurking just beneath the surface (unlike other open-world games where you can never complete the 'main quest' and still explore the entirety of the world). This hampers the game somewhat, though, as you as a player may feel railroaded into performing some things just for the sake of progression, even if you want more time to just float around the world.\n\nThe real appeal of CoP comes from exploration. Sure, each map is, in the end, just a collection of a dozen or so "points of interest", each of which corresponds to a specific scenario -- here is a building that you can explore, there is a field full of Boiler anomalies that superheat the air, and so forth. But in your first playthrough, at least, exploring each of these locations feels deep enough that it feels like you're really blazing new trails into the mysterious and dangerous Zone.\n\nAs far as character progression goes, there aren't any RPG aspects insofar as levels and skills -- no stat distribution screens here. Instead, a fluid progression system emerges from acquiring and upgrading new gear. And while there are certainly high and low ends of the spectrum for both weapons and armor, an interesting upgrade system performed by a mechanic NPC means that even a beginning-of-the-game weapon can perform adequately to let you handle the toughest of mutants and the most heavily-armed NPCs. The real limiting factor is money -- but, as you get more money and/or loot to sell as you do more things in the world, it functions as a sort of experience system, where getting enough money lets you buy a new suit of armor, or perhaps a few upgrades to the suit you already have that increases its survivability in radioactive environments.\n\nMoving on to artifacts: As explained earlier, artifacts are mysterious (there's that word again) objects possessing unique abilities that, more often than not, are helpful to your character. This comes at a cost, though, as many artifacts are still inherently radioactive (represented by a +# representation, based on the radioactivity), and will cause you harm if you use them for too long. Their use is through their placement in an "artifact pouch", wherein their effects -- both positive and negative -- will be able to affect you. Or you can always just carry them in your backpack, where they can't hurt you, but can't help you either. And thus a balance has to be struck between using artifacts that help you in the near future -- mental protection as you're about to fight telepathic mutants, for example -- and either bearing the radioactivity, using your precious anti-rad meds as a stopgap measure, or using one of the slightly-rarer anti-radioactivity artifacts (which have -# in the radioactivity measurement), the lattermost of which can negate the other artifacts, and even give you a baseline radioactivity resistance.\n\nWith that, I come to the final point, which is the plethora of in-game stats that the player has to take into effect. There are eight, each with their own means of being inflicted and being protected against or healed. Roughly speaking, these stats and a brief summary are:\n\n1.) Impact -- The effect (damage and flinching) of gravitational effects (anomalies or stuff being thrown at you telekinetically), or being smacked around by mutants with physical attacks\n2.) Wounding/Bleeding -- Slow health loss through cuts, bullet wounds, etc.\n3.) Explosion -- Self-explanatory\n4.) Firearms -- The effect (damage and flinching) of gunfire\n5.) Burn -- The damage of thermal effects (fires, thermal anomalies, etc.)\n6.) Chemical -- The damage of chemical hazards (typically anomalies)\n7.) Electric -- The damage of electrical anomalies\n8.) Radiation -- The damage and effect (screen blurring, stamina drain, etc.) of radioactive objects and anomalies\n9.) Psy/Mental -- The damage and effect of mental attacks (almost exclusively by psychic mutants)\n\nAs you can see, there are many stats to be concerned with, but they fall into two general categories -- combat and environment. For the most part, environmental resistances are only momentary concerns based on the current situation -- no need to worry about Burn resistance unless you're going into a field of hot anomalies -- wheareas the combat stats are all-round necessities. The trick is to balance finding armor with the stats you need (with upgrades providing some measure of balance for stats they lack), artifacts that will resist what you're about to do in the immediate future, and using on-demand items that temporarily boost resistances.\n\nIn the end, the Zone is worth at least one solid playthrough, even if in doing so you explore every point of interest, locate one of every artifact, and collect every piece of gear possible. An emergent mod community has also put together mods doing everything from merely adding a handful of gear to be found, to some introducing entire new zones imported from the previous games. In the end, I would conclude that S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat is worth playing, if for no other reason than to demonstrate that an FPS can have a non-setpiece story, and some aspect of RPGs, without losing part of itself in the process.","December 24, 2014","true","158.7"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/ibnalhazred/recommended/41700/","ibnalhazred","Alhazred","http://steamcommunity.com/id/ibnalhazred/","323 products in account","As a technical note, I've played this game until its final culminating 10 minutes, because the game just doesn't manage to keep itself running when I reach a certain point in the final evacuation, about halfway through the mission. After seeing videos about the final minutes, I haven't missed too much.\n\nSo, S.T.A.L.K.E.R.. Perhaps my favorite game series of all time. In many ways a review of this final installment of the series is a commentary on them all. Excluding obvious technical remarks about poor optimization, poor stability at times and glitches ranging from hilarious to potentially game-breaking, I have mostly praise to deliver.\n\nStalker-games all center around on adventuring - and at times, merely surviving - in what possibly is the most wonderful theme that has ever blessed mankind, which at the same time is one of the most horrific disasters striking that said mankind. Stalker-games' relation to the accident at Chernobyl is tangential at best (the same could be said about its relation to the Roadside Picnic novel and Stalker movie), it still captures enough of the real to make for compelling fantasy. Reality does not stop at the theme itself, but the fact that much of the speech and non-spoken text is also preserved in its original form of Russian (even though it should probably be Ukrainian, but what do we stupid self-centered westerners know?) makes the game feel so much more genuine than your run-of-the-mill modern shooter, where the most foreign element you encounter is heavily accented English.\n\nEven though Stalkers do not aim to be ARMA-like simulators, they nonetheless take certain pride in their genre. Iron sights are viable, even mandatory, and different weapons and alternative ammunition are plenty, if somewhat dumbed-down in this third installment, compared to the first game. Armor and weapons can be upgraded with numerous convincing-sounding doodads which, while not always presenting itself too clearly what their actual benefit to the player is, serves as an addictive middle-term goal. With some differences I would say all Stalker-games can be discussed as a one entity. Even though balance changes between each game, and the first game being possibly mechanically most poor, if you like one Stalker-game, you probably at least tolerate them all.\n\nTo say something about Call of Pripyat itself, while being immensely recommendable to all shooter game fans, it still falls short compared to what I see as the Ultimate Stalker, Shadow of Chernobyl. While it does quite well exploring its own side of the universe, it still manages to deliver the story as more simple, much less mystical and intriguing as the first two games did. It feels too much like an epilogue, which it irreversably is. Possibly this is partially planned. Without going into too much (spoiler-)detail, to the player the Zone no longer bears any mysticism. You have already learned its secrets, already know what makes it tick. You no longer even play a lone wanderer intent on deciphering its secrets, you are a government man on a mission that only accidentally happens to uncover more of the truth. And even in this it manages to do so in almost sorrowful frontier fiction -fashion: now that mystery is solved, control can be established and the myth has to make room for reality. What was already a world of the past ceases to exist altogether. In a considerably concrete way the game punts you out to the post-Stalker world. The Old can be revisited, but never again experienced in the same way. Or that is how I, with a touch of melodrama, understand it.\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.-games offer a quite unique and compelling setting in an enjoyable, if unpolished way. Their genuine delivery feels exceptionally loving treatment of an IP, at least comparing to many modern shooters, or games in general. If one requires alleviation to Stalker-withdrawal, Metro-series is a worthy runner-up, if not a perfect match. 5/5 x 3.","May 1","true","22.3"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The atmosphere of it is excellent and so is the gameplay. It flaws only at the cheesy cutscene dialogues. Also, after beating this game once I deffinitely reccomend that you get a mod for it called MISERY. It brings an enormous realism to the game and makes the Zone the true nightmare that it was meant to be. Having to fend off 4 bandits (which now attack you on sight) with a corroded Makarov and only a few rounds is not for the weak. Take the Dark Road Beggining if you want to be a true STALKER. MISERY is regarded as one of the most difficult mods of all times.

At times I was too scared to go on, and coming from me, that says something. It should be noted that it is also extremely crash-happy still, so make sure to save often. It really encourages exploration and actually leaves it up to the player to how much time they really want to invest in it, and it rewards that.

Even though the two stories arent strictly linked, the game and atmosphere feels alot more developed once you play through SoC.\n\nIf you decide to jump into Call of Pripyat anyways then once you get past the steep learning curve youll find yourself in a pretty large world without much indication of what to do. Basically all you need to know is that everything is out to kill you and unless youre 10+ hours into the game, everything will kill you without even giving you a chance. Hitting that F5 button is a must every 2 minutes because you can and you will die every 2 minutes in your first playthrough. Getting money to buy better gear is a must and doing the side missions just happen as you go along. Once you find yourself being able to kill bandits and small fry mutants, then you are in a position to actually start the main story and continue the game as intended.\n\nPros of this game is that the atmosphere in this is unmatched by any game ive played since its release up to the time of this review. The gun physics is amazing as the bullets are physical objects and shooting just doesnt get any more satisfying than this, that I can garuantee. The survival elements of this game are really harsh at first but once you get mid range equipment, you should be able to get a reasonable income for items and such to keep you going. End game is mainly about exploring and the survival elements are very minimal as youre probably pretty rich by then and the stores always have enough supply.\n\nCons are that even though the game is open world with alot of varying activities, I have to say that to me the main story felt no different than doing a very long series of side missions. Theres also the fact that once you reach a certain point in the game, the atmosphere changes from survival to just completing missions and loses alot of its immersion (IMO).\n\nOn the plus side again though there is a HUGE amount of mods available for this game and trying them out gives you a new experience every time.\n\n\n","January 1","true","303.4"," 3 of 3 people (100%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","100","3","3","0","0"

The stalker games were a surprise hit right from the start and it's a shame to see the series end, especially with this game where everything seems to turning in the right direction once again.\n\nCall of Pripyat, like the other stalker games, is an open world first person shooter with some minor RPG elements thrown in for good measure. You roam the radioactive wasteland surrounded Chernobyl, searching for "artifacts", valuable and rare commodities created by the various spacial anomalies created by the nuclear meltdown so many years ago. To keep things interesting you will have to contend with other stalkers wanting the artifacts for themselves, shadowy organizations with their own secret agendas, the Ukrainian military and of course, horribly mutated monsters.\n\nOne thing that Call of Pripyat does notably different from it's predecessors is slowing things down quite a bit. Instead of every map being a battlefield of constant and relentless attacks by seemingly unending forces from the various factions populating the zone combat is now much rarer. This has the very welcoming effect of making the game world feel like the radioactive wasteland it's supposed to be, every encounter is more intense because of it and it feels a little special when you encounter a group of stalkers who promptly tell you to holster your weapons or get lost rather than simply open fire on sight.\n\nThe faction system that was present in Clear Sky has all but been removed and this also helps push the pace of the game more towards Survival Horror than Mindless Shooter. While the factions still exists, still do battle with one another and still treat you differently depending on your actions there is no constant defend and attack missions and broken faction relations and this goes a long way towards making you feel like you're playing your own game, rather than just being another soldier in a never ending war.\n\nDespite all the good there is still plenty of bad however. The game is much smaller than both it's predecessors and the great storyline and mysteries from Shadow of Chernobyl is nowhere to be found. Also the difficulty has been toned down considerably which will elate some and irate others.\n\nThe engine is still pretty bad, the animations have been cleaned up a little but are still very clunky and despite the graphical enchantments that the series has been undergoing since Clear Sky this game still has that "raw" feeling of Shadow of Chernobyl. That feel like you're playing something half-done. Something that could have used another year of polishing. While this might normally be enough to make you quit the game Call of Pripyat manages to accomplish the same fear as the original. It makes you enjoy it despite it's many flaws. Sure you will probably grab the first graphical enhancement mod you come across but that's not because you can't play the game without it, it's because you have to play the game regardless and just want to spare your eyes a little.\n\nCall of Pripyat is a good way to end the stalker series I suppose. It's a good game and has many improvements over it's predecessors. But completing I still feel like something is lacking. A true "S.T.A.L.K.E.R 2" might not be something we will ever see but it sure is something we can hope for.","December 18, 2012","true","221.2"," 4 of 5 people (80%) found this review helpful","80","4","5","0","0"

After trying out various mods for this game, I eventually went with Misery Mod 1.0 (2.0 was too much for my wimpy laptop, but I personally think 1.0 was better anyway). I also completed the game on Master difficulty.\n\nModding aside, CoP is a brilliant open-world shooter. While there is a story that the player eventually needs to progress through, the open-world element puts you in control of the pace of the game so you can explore/merc all you want and then perform the essential plotline tasks when you're ready. I loved the idea of three gigantic levels taking the places of seven or eight smaller ones. The gunfights are technical and challenging. The finale of this game is terrific - probably the most intense gunfight I've experienced in a game.\n\nBy the time I was done with CoP's prequels, I was craving more difficulty, so I installed Misery, which was pretty unforgiving in the early game. It also creates a bleak atmosphere, adds new weapons, and changes the sound a bit. The mod also tweaked the random events, keeping the player on edge.

If you like Fallout 3, then consider the STALKER series Fallout on steroids. Combat is intense, against both humans and mutants alike, and a single headshot from an enemy is enough to take you out. You have an absurd amount of freedom in this game. If you want to shoot the guy giving you a mission, you can. If you want to shoot the guy who just rewarded you for completing a mission, you can. I've already been playing this game, CoP for about 15 hours and haven't even started with the mainline story missions, there's so much else you can do.\n\nNot to mention this game is so DYNAMIC. Enemies get into firefights if they're in opposing groups, or mutants against humans. Bandits and other stalkers will loot dead bodies after killing them. Wounded enemies can either be healed with one of your medkits or executed. Wild packs of mutants will kill human AI and drag their bodies off to be eaten. And anomolies don't discriminate against who they destroy. These are things that were in all of the STALKER games, mind you.\n\nIf you do decide to get this game, be sure to download either the complete (better graphics, improved gameplay, bug fixes) or the Misery (same as Complete only a LOT harder) mods. They're a good pick for even a first time run through, though I would only do Misery if you are really patient and don't mind dying a lot.","June 14, 2014","true","25.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Here, the game finally offers a completely new map with new places to visit and NPCs to interact with. Also, it continues the story of the first Stalker game. You, as a stalker and agent, investigate why several helicopters crashed during their mission which aimed to scout the area so that the military could find out how exactly the Zone had changed after the events of the first game.\n\nThis seems to be the most stable of all the Stalker games and it should also be noted that the only one offering you to stay once the main story is completed. It was annoying in the previous two games that I was not exactly notified that once the journey to the centre of the Zone started all my side missions would remain incomplete. Here, at the end of the game, you can make a decision to stay and complete any unfinished quests you had or explore any undiscovered areas.\n\nAlso, this Stalker game seems to be the only one that rarely had any crashes when I was playing it - it is a stable version where you encounter few glitches or bugs. This is of course all the feedback on the vanilla game as the COMPLETE mod was also released for this version further enhancing the Stalker experience. Still, it is commendable that GSC Game World put enough time and effort to release a functional game that was enjoyable without having to wait for further patches on the date of release.\n\nCall of Pripyat should be picked up by those who liked Shadow of Chernobyl. Do skip Clear Sky and pick this one in its stead. After installing the game install the COMPLETE mod to have the best Stalker experience to date.","March 15, 2014","true","28.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sometimes things fill a gap we never knew we had. Like Pascal's "God-shaped vacuum in the heart of every person", there was a S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-shaped hole in my Steam catalogue.\n\nShadow of Chernobyl, the first game in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, is often (and rightly) touted as a flawed but ground-breaking masterpiece. The second, Clear Skies, is all too often disregarded. Call of Pripyat, IMHO, is one of those rare instances when the third in a trilogy improves on what has come before. Some have pointed to a superior story in Shadow of Chernobyl, and this is a natural impression given by the novelty of the first in a series. The burdens heaped on the difficult third of the trilogy's shoulders (following an already classic first and an almost universally panned second) were daunting. That it can stand alone as a masterpiece, and take pride of place in the trilogy that birthed it, is truly impressive.\n\nThe sandbox, free-roaming FPS skeleton of the game is all but flawless. Gone are the irritating and frequent zone-transitions of the first two games - the map is divided into three instanced zones, but within those zones the travel is seamless. It is a rich and believable world, but you will require a fast CPU and/or installing game on an SSD to avoid micro-pauses every so often as you move through the map. Mob AI is vastly improved upon, and, despite all three games in the series using the same "X-Ray" engine, CoP's graphics are an improvement beyond what could be expected.\n\nCall of Pripyat's cast of weapons and armors are as loveable, believable, and as almost-touchable as the characters. Weapons are almost all faithful renditions of the NATO and Warsaw Pact arsenals, with nods and developments to the alternate history STALKER narrates. No min/max table lurks behind the equipment; no backwards-engineered dps spreadsheet. Instead, a well-balanced cast of items, with pros and cons emerging naturally from the real-world items they reproduce.\n\nLike the two S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games that preced it, Call of Pripyat mods extremely well. The modding community has developed a catalogue of astounding size, quality and diversity. As is usual for a well-modded game, some mods almost inarguably improve on the game, some add extra content, while a few simply break the experience. I recommend playing through without mods first.\n\nAfter gauging the experience, I recommend either MISERY, a massive and thorough reworking of the game; or if you prefer to retain the gameplay and difficulty of the vanilla game while improving on the graphics, a combination of mods such as Atmosfear, Absolute Nature and Absolute structures, and Particle Paradise will yield excellent returns. Although the "Complete" mods are sound for the first two S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, I cannot recommend the CoP Complete Mod. It significantly dumbs-down the combat, while implementing graphical tweaks either similar or inferior to those previously mentioned.","June 17, 2014","true","89.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Sometimes things fill a gap we never knew we had. Like Pascal's "God-shaped vacuum in the heart of every person", there was a S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-shaped hole in my Steam catalogue.\n\nShadow of Chernobyl, the first game in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series, is often (and rightly) touted as a flawed but ground-breaking masterpiece. The second, Clear Skies, is all too often disregarded. Call of Pripyat, IMHO, is one of those rare instances when the third in a trilogy improves on what has come before. Some have pointed to a superior story in Shadow of Chernobyl, and this is a natural impression given by the novelty of the first in a series. The burdens heaped on the difficult third of the trilogy's shoulders (following an already classic first and an almost universally panned second) were daunting. That it can stand alone as a masterpiece, and take pride of place in the trilogy that birthed it, is truly impressive.\n\nThe sandbox, free-roaming FPS skeleton of the game is all but flawless. Gone are the irritating and frequent zone-transitions of the first two games - the map is divided into three instanced zones, but within those zones the travel is seamless. It is a rich and believable world, but you will require a fast CPU and/or installing game on an SSD to avoid micro-pauses every so often as you move through the map. Mob AI is vastly improved upon, and, despite all three games in the series using the same "X-Ray" engine, CoP's graphics are an improvement beyond what could be expected.\n\nCall of Pripyat's cast of weapons and armors are as loveable, believable, and as almost-touchable as the characters. Weapons are almost all faithful renditions of the NATO and Warsaw Pact arsenals, with nods and developments to the alternate history STALKER narrates. No min/max table lurks behind the equipment; no backwards-engineered dps spreadsheet. Instead, a well-balanced cast of items, with pros and cons emerging naturally from the real-world items they reproduce.\n\nLike the two S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games that preced it, Call of Pripyat mods extremely well. The modding community has developed a catalogue of astounding size, quality and diversity. As is usual for a well-modded game, some mods almost inarguably improve on the game, some add extra content, while a few simply break the experience. I recommend playing through without mods first.\n\nAfter gauging the experience, I recommend either MISERY, a massive and thorough reworking of the game; or if you prefer to retain the gameplay and difficulty of the vanilla game while improving on the graphics, a combination of mods such as Atmosfear, Absolute Nature and Absolute structures, and Particle Paradise will yield excellent returns. Although the "Complete" mods are sound for the first two S.T.A.L.K.E.R. games, I cannot recommend the CoP Complete Mod. It significantly dumbs-down the combat, while implementing graphical tweaks either similar or inferior to those previously mentioned.","June 17, 2014","true","89.0"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

Good mechanics, a nice range of weapons easily modifiable, and good difficulty that isn't too excessive. That's the short. Now for the long.\n\nThe long is that S.T.AL.K.E.R. is a great survival FPS renown for it's excellent portrayal of The Zone, a post-Chernobyl irradiated anomaly in Ukraine that is growing day by day expanding it's influence and luring treasure hunters guns-for-hire and thieves all to it's landscape for either massive wealth or their inevitable doom. Some of you might think, "but Wille, this has been done before. Why is this any different?" It isn't but it's done right and that's the key difference. A lot of survival games might thrust you into an area you know all of nothing about. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. doesn't do this. Your character is given plenty of dialogue with other characters as they slowly establish this large world around you from the starting area outwards. It's done like this in all of the series' titles and that is easily their best feature. Where they don't excel in graphics they do excel in amazing story and worldbuilding among other things, and the graphics are more than passable.\n\nOn to gunplay and mechanics. It's a survival game so you have your standard fare here. Heavy-hitting high recoil weapons that shred mooks and shred you if you're naked along with the typical things like hunger, radiation and the ability to bleed. Bleeding is easily stopped with twenty plasters applied on the wound whether it's a shot from a 9 mil or a crater-making blast from an anti-materiel rifle. This works to the game's benefit as it is a survival game but it also doesn't have to be overly difficult to be one. Many survival games think survival is ball-busting fun-stifling monsters teabagging your corpse death after death before you can even reach the level one safe zone. S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has always given you time to prepare where other games wouldn't. For this reason alone it could get my reccomendation it could look Minecraft bad and with mechanics like this I'd still love it over anything any day of the week.\n\nNot much more can be said.

I don't think some things were 100% finnished, and it seems to really need mods to help the game play, which isn't good or bad but for me, personally, but I had a hard time getting the right mods together.\n\nIn vinilla gameplay, the first things I realized were wrong were the ak-74u and the gun sounds. They were waaay to quite, kinda unsatisfyng, Thankfully theres a mod for that that isn't so hard to find. The ak-74u on the other hand just looked wierd, the ejection port was on the left side; I had to watch poorly renderd casings come out the wrong side of the gun. A.I., of course, is also bad. It needed mods.\n\nOnce I got to modding I saw a lot of great mods, or from the cover they look good. A lot of recent bad reviews kept me from the bigger mods (misery, complete, ect.) so I looked for mods with good reviews. the SGM mods (both 2.2 and geo) were o.k. but still not the expirince I was looking for, So then I tried the a couple of mod packs. Some had this others had that, none were good enough. Now, I finnialy tried misery 2.0 and it was actully really good.\n\nOver all, I give it a 8.5/10 after getting misery, amazing realistic, horrer survival game play.\nThen I got the "killer mod pack" now it's like a 9.5/10, at least.","January 4, 2014","true","125.5"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

I am a really huge fan of horror games, first person shooters, and open world, and this game puts all of those together beautifully and in such a unique way. Also if you like to push yourself in video games this game is definitely the Dark Souls of FPS and I feel the best way to immerse yourself in this game is to play it on master and if you find it too difficult then that's too bad because that is the life of a S.T.A.L.K.E.R.(plus there's the Misery Mod). Plus I can't count how many times I've been killed by one shot on master difficulty, or how many times I have to repair armor/guns. Also its also the little things in the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. world that can be the most meomorable. I would wonder through the world and stumble upon four other S.T.A.L.K.E.R's playing music and drinking vodka with dead animal carcasses everywhere, and I would be talking to a bandit and a dog mauled him during conversation and his bandit buddies would walk away (because freinds stick up for one another right?). I haven't come close to finishing it as I just got to Pripyat in the game, but I can also tell you that the sidequests aren't too repetitive, unoriginal, and boring. The only problems I have so far are the stiff characters and the english voice acting of the AI, but again, there's a mod that has the AI speak russian if you want it to be realistic. The graphics aren't mind blowing (but they are really good none the less and it's always worth killing yourself to watch an emission take place), but if you play for the graphics than you are not welcome here. Once I'm able to finish the game I can talk about the story.","November 19, 2015","true","50.3"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

While the main plot is good itself, a lot of the best moments come from the side quests.\n\n-Enemies are well done. There is a decent range of different mutants with different focuses.\n\n-Alive world. Unlike something like skyrim where 99% of the encounters are scripted, the game's entire world has different squads and mutants shifting about. Since practically no NPCs are unkillable, this can lead to some people you have invested a bit of time into being killed while on patrol.\n\n-Better ending(s) than Mass Effect 3. While this game doesn't have a lot of traditional RPG elements, the branching endings make a lot of the questlines more meaningful.\n\nCons:\n-The world isn't that big. Okay, this is probably a more extreme version of what I experienced with skyrim. After the 500th hour or whatever, you know the landscape to an extent to where the game world can't offer anything new. But yeah, the way the world is split up into three areas really limits the spaces you can visit without a guide. The earlier games handled this much better with smaller maps, but a seemingly larger space in total. Now, of course, this game does pretty much everything else better.\n\n-Bugs. It really doesn't seem that bad, but they do occur and I pretty much unconciously ignore them since I'm used to that type of thing. I would still consider it less buggy than Skyrim. I haven't ever had any quests break entirely, but I have had to reload my last save a few times.\n\n-AI. On any mission where you have to follow/lead around any AI, its failures become readily apparent. Due to some of the unreasonably strict casualty limitations to get some of the better ending slides, this can either require some save-scumming or just dealing with the worse ending. But seriously, the AI is extremely sucky against mutants and grenades. They feel like CoD level NPCs where they aren't even trying to fight properly against the enemy.\n\n-Graphics. I really don't give half a crap about graphics, but it is definately worth mentioning. Anyway, the "Complete" mod would be worthwhile for a second playthrough (or a first if you are particularily pedantic). It nice-inates the graphics while staying mostly true to the game. For better graphics you can try the Misery mod, but of course that changes a ton of stuff. While I have done 1-2 playthroughs with it installed, it adds instability to an already somewhat instable game.\n\n\nAnyway, its a great game that I would totally recommend!\n\n(Note: I got this game for free, but simply with my computer a few years back and not for any promotional thing or whatever by the devs. With hindsight, I would buy it at double price in a second)","June 2","true","149.6"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","0"

It really captured the sense of Russia in an apocalyptic stage. It has some open world elements to is with a very good story. It might seem a little old for the new gamers but once you get in to it than I’ll think they will share my vision.\n\nThe coolest part of the staler series I think is the psy damage you can take. That moment there is some kind of anomaly that makes you insane, making you hear voices and makes you see things there aren’t there. And the emisions  make you feel like you have to outrun a nuclear explosion. next to that there are more kids of damages you could receive like burns, poison damage, bleeding damage, radiation, starvation, shock damage, Rupture (from mutants animals), and explosion damage.\n\nThe mutants are quite scary and you can always hear them from a far adding to the horror element of the game. Some mutants turn invisible and become visible again once close to you trying to suck you blood. Other mutants try to control you brain. And that really makes me ♥♥♥♥ bricks.\n\nCall of Pripyat is one is one of the few series that S.T.A.L.K.E.R. has to offer.

I thought that was the epitome of survival wasteland fps/rpg gaming. Then I find this stalker shadow of Chernobyl game and think generic knockoff. After going through stalker 1.0 with all the weird bugs however, I soon realized this was fallout on steroids.\n\nThe mood of the game, the difficulty (initially), even the lighting was exceptional. Also, what I'd call the rpg elements of getting better gear felt more natural as opposed to leveling stats on my guy in fallout. Walking around the metro shooting ghouls with the terrible shotgun whilst paused in v.a.t.s. pales in comparison to going into the labs around Chernobyl. Chernobyl had zombies but also included cloaking bloodsuckers lurking behind you, snorks ready to pounce, a behemoth flesh creature, along with mutated dogs, poltergeists, and various other startling abominations.\n\nClear sky brought in the interesting concept of modifying weapons and factions. That was about all Clear Sky offered save for an upgrade to the Xray engine. Oddly enough, the factions were lost with the next installment\n\nNow with the most refined version of Call of Pripyat what was interesting before is even better.  Hunting in anomalies for artifacts using a detection device and throwing bolts is a very interesting way of essentially mining the environment. Secret stashes that can be found at any time without prerequisite was a good addition.\n\nCall of Pripyat also saw a better structured campaign. SoC was too loose, CS was to linear, CoP to me is just right. Though don't get me wrong the game in all iterations is open roaming, but CS felt like walking through levels and SoC had areas of no interest.\n\nI've just been playing a heavily modified Call of Pripyat and it's almost like a new game again. the mods give it a high replay ability factor.\n\nSneaking into a mercenary base and taking out heavy geared mercs then looting everything is oddly satisfying. Then, trying to walk back in complete darkness to sell loot with all manner of hostile creatures about is icing on the cake.\n\nI recommend anyone interested in good games to play this.\n","May 31, 2014","true","53.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Many good features from the previous games have been polished such as trading, upgrading items, combat, artifact detection and collection, and even questing. The plot and ending really got to me.\n\nThe open world is an issue. The pacing of progression between questing areas is a bit of a different flavor from previous games. In Call of Pripyat, your progress between zones is limited by story progression. This is in contrast to SoC where your exploration was (mostly) only limited by progressively more difficult opponents and anomalies. On the other hand, while CoP locks you into a zone, it's not exactly a small space. Later in the game, you'll even find yourself with reasons to go back to previous areas for bonuses and min/maxing.\n\nThe RPG element has been well polished as well. The importance of your equipment choices cannot be understated. With a wide variety of weapons, armor, attachments and modification trees (like talent trees!), consumables, and artifacts(stat altering) your options are quite vast. There are many situations in the game where the proper equipment can turn a fevered fight for survival into a even back and fourth or perhaps little challange at all.\n\nAs a STALKER game it would be poor form for me not to comment on the atmosphere. This is something I feel Call of Pripyat, like it's predecessors, did very well. At a glace, some may see only a melancholy dystopia sprinkled with shock and a little horror, but there's so much more to it. While the darkness and gloom are very evident, beneath the surface lies the subtle thrill of being on the edge of an unexplored frontier with somthing to discover around every corner. You never know who or what you'll run into next.\n\nThe themes behind the game and STALKER in general are fairly mature. For all the good in the game, it's still (IMO) dark, gritty, and brutally honest about "might" and it's connection to what is "right". There is good in this world, but it's few and far between. As for the plot, it certainly helps to have experience in the previous games. From the get-go you're aware your character's motivation is ethically dubious at best. To his credit, the MC grows and confronts these issues making him seem more relatable.\n\nIf you want a full experience I recommend you play the previous STALKER games first. There are plenty of references and even an important character or two. Problem is, I don't believe any of these games have aged particularly well graphically or mechanically. But if you can suffer though some imperfections, the experience is worth it.\n\nOne final and important note, there are some good mods for Call of Pripyat as well as previous games. If you manage to get though the game, modding is definitely a way to expand re-playability.","July 4, 2014","true","144.3"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/7grain/recommended/41700/","7grain","7grain","http://steamcommunity.com/id/7grain/","291 products in account","STALKER: Call of Pripyat (CoP)\n\nAnother excellent installment in the STALKER series. I love these games - they succeed in combining FPS and RPG gameplay like no other. When pressed to describe the STALKER games, I find it easiest to explain them as "RPGs without all the fiddly bits." You have quests and inventory, but no stats and levels. There's no inflating abilities with experience points - everything you do, you do to move the game along, not to build a gold stash or level up for a boss fight.\n\nCoP is the most polished of the three STALKER games. Not easier, though - combat is still challenging, and ammo scarce. But the quests are more linear, with fewer distractions as you move through the story. I approve of that streamlining, as CoP has more story to tell than the other two games. Total game time here is the same as the others... roughly 30 hours, give or take, depending on how much you choose to accomplish.\n\nWhy I enjoy the STALKER series so much is that they delver a plausible game world. When you explore, you will find distant locations that have no bearing on the game's story, yet are meticulously crafted. Unlike most RPGs, you don't feel like the center of the universe. Instead, you feel like a visitor to a world that has been there before you arrived, and will continue after you leave. And dangerous! Here is a game where you stay on the roads, and seek shelter at night. A game where a pack of wild dogs is actually as dangerous as it should be.\n\nEach NPC has a name, and goes about his own life in the Zone. CoP plays this to the extreme - when the game ends, you are treated to a slideshow that describes what becomes of roughly 20 NPCs that you will encounter through the game. For each character, his denoument is affected by your interaction with him. I found this very rewarding.\n\nMy one gripe is that CoP plays down the faction wars that were such a big part of STALKER: Clear Sky. I missed picking sides between Freedom and Duty. But all of the familiar factions are present in this game. Freedom and Duty have reached an easy peace. Stalkers and Bandits are still two sides of the same coin. And Monolith is still a pain in the ♥♥♥♥.\n\nYes, I do recommend this game. And as always, STALKER games are best with their accompanying "Complete" mod. These mods bring higher-quality graphics and sound, and excellent weather effects to the STALKER series, without changing the core game. They also minimize some of the repetitive NPC quotes you hear in the game. They are a must, even for first playthrough.

This game has three very large open areas to explore and a great deal of handcrafted, well-scripted quests as opposed to the endlessly generated "go here, fetch that" quests that were the daily fare of the previous two games.\n\nThe overall plot arc isn't as interesting as its predecessors, but it does reference them well. It also has several endings, Fallout slideshow style, based upon your involvement throughout the game, which lends towards a satisfying conclusion and encourages replayability. Call of Pripyat is the culmination of the systems introduced in the previous two games - setting, gameplay mechanics, and introduces an extra layer of attention to detail and care that pushes it above its predecessors.\\n\nI'd call it the most complete S.T.A.L.K.E.R. experience.

I can't love this game and yet I want to, I can't hate it and yet I want to. I suppose I was just so excited at the premise of an open world shooter set in Pripyat, the idea alone is worth so much and yet I find myself ambivalent. It's really fun to explore the dark, depressing but not tense world of post-Chernobyl Pripyat (and the outlying areas, you don't actually REACH Pripyat until much later) but it feels so sparse. I know you'd expect that sort of thing from an irradiated area but it feels like a few meagre locations interspersed with mostly identical grassland with the occasional swamp or trees or anomaly, it works from a canonical standpoint but I feel it cheapens the whole "open world" aspect. The almost utter lack of voice acting prbably wouldn't have bothered me so much except it makes it impossible to distinguish people. They have no personality of which to speak and whatever voice acting you DO get is at best okay (sometimes you can CLEARLY hear the same person switch between two different voice actors, one in English and one in Russian), I really feel as if the NPC's in this game are a serious impediment to the enjoyment of what is otherwise quite a fine game. Gunplay is a bit turgid, the guns don't really have much feeling to them and there's no real discernible differences in firepower within the same class of firearm. All the pistols are like peashooters to most enemies, shotguns are okay and so on, although I kind of liked the Gauss Rifle which brings me to another issue in the area of sound. Most of it is actually quite good, especially at night when it gets actually really atmospheric with rather haunting animal noises, crickets and a bit of fairly repetitive but good background music. But a lot of the audio sounds so uninspired and boring, especially gunfire (with particular note to the Gauss Rifle, it sounds terrible), item noises sometimes don't make sense and can get repetitive (although that is understandable). The ending was also really abrupt and very unsatisfactory. Yet despite its many failings this game has quite a bit to offer the discerning gamer, even if I can't quite elucidate my reasons for liking it. All I can say it's atmospheric, the world is pretty good looking if sparse and the concept of anomalies and stuff in Pripyat is interesting and quite engaging. This game might not live up to its potential but it is worth your time. I sincerely hope they get some experienced devs to make the sequel this IP deserves.\n\nEDIT: I suppose in retrospect this review looked quite negative, but this is a really engrossing game at times and the fact that there's no hand holding or explanation of which to speak means that it's on you to figure everything out and that's always a plus for immersion. If it's ever on sale do buy this game, for all its flaws it is still a good game.","July 18, 2014","true","22.0"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

Series as always been my favourite series of games for a number of reasons, whether it is the crazy amount of weird and wonderful guns, suits and items, or the weird and whacky storyline, i love almost everything about this game , and i will say why now.\n\nStory:\none of my favourite parts about the stalker games is the story lines that always seem to have a big twist at the end or something like that. Anyway, the story in CoP is really quite cool how they made it all play out, one of the best bits is being able to see how you affected every other stalkers life while you were in the zone at the end of the game with about 20 or so slides telling you about what happend after you left the zone.\n\nWeaponry:\nWith a decent selection of weaponry for all play styles, this game can make you play through it many times just so you can play around with the guns and ammo types ( two for each gun except the PKM, Sniper rifles and the RPG ). from shotguns to expermental gaus rifles, this game unmodded provided me with atleast 70 hours before i even thought about modding it.\n\nSuits / Armour:\nStalker has system whereby you can wear suits that affect your carry weight, protection for various envriomental hazards, gunfire and can effect your mobility. CoP by far offers the most diverse Suit system by allowing the player to (with most suits) mix and match head gear and main body suits depending on your play style, (gas masks for artifact hunters, military helmets for combat, and high-end mixes of both). There is a massive variety of upgrades that can completley changes the suits performance (Servos on an exoskeleton, alloying you to sprint).\n\nUpgrading your equipment:\nCoP allows you to collect tool kits and gie them to technicians, who will reward you with the ability to upgrade your guns and suits more (and a small cash reward). You can turn a AK-74 into a laser fast firing assault cannon, or make it a more accurate mid range sniper.\n\nstill wip","February 21, 2014","true","179.2"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

This appears to be one of those games that you learn about the hard way, for example every now and then something called an Emission explodes across the whole map and wipes out everyone, I found myself getting killed over and over again by the first Emission until I eventually gave up and Googled it, I discovered that you have to hide underground in order to escape it...I guess this is just the cruel nature of this game because it gives you little to no information on anything, not even the basic mechanics are revealed to you and you have to study up everything just like Dark Souls.\n\nThe atmosphere in this game is astonishing and I have never seen a game come even close to the dark, creepy and radioactive atmosphere that this game has, I spent most of my time too afriad to enter buildings because of the various sanity destroying sounds coming out of them.\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R: Call of Pripyat is a game I really want to get into but the difficulty and various mechanics that I know nothing about keeps scaring me away from it. Some people say that this game is a Fallout 3 ripoff and I find that really offensive because the developers must of worked really hard on this game and I feel like they didn't get the respect/money that they deserved because this game is different and somewhat ahead of its time.\n\nNow get out of here Stalker!","April 8, 2015","true","10.8"," 3 of 4 people (75%) found this review helpful","75","3","4","0","0"

To remind my readers, this is now based on the vanilla experience, as this will conclude the 3 stalker games' revisions.\n\nWhat can i say about this game? Was it fun? Yes. Was it more sandbox-y than Clear Sky? Yes. Did it feel empty and hollow? You bet. For all the mechanics that the developers improved upon they possibly refined a little too much, to the point that the streamlined gameplay somehow made the game easier. This is Stalker we are talking about here. It's not supposed to be easy.....is it? Even on Master skill this game was easier than Clear Sky or Shadow of Chernobyl on Stalker (Medium) skill. The developers improved the upgrade mechanic, to where you no longer need to fetch flash drives and bring them to the respective mechanics. Instead, you're left with finding tools in each of the first 2 maps to bring to the mechanics, and then have to travel to Pripyat to find the last of the tools. Not quite as tedious to some, but still requires you to do some work.\n\nThe graphics in my opinion took a step in the wrong direction. While the lighting may have improved a little with the DirectX 11 renderer, most of everything else seemed like it was ripped from SoC in terms of quality. Maybe this had to do with the larger, albeit fewer, maps. Honestly, i really couldn't tell much of a difference at all between DX 9 and 11, aside from a little improved lighting. The characters still have the same facial animations, reload animations, etc....\n\nThe sound was vastly improved,and while the sound effects still aren't of a caliber as say Battlefield, they do the job. Now, when the emissions hit, however, the sound design improves because it brings back the creepy vibe of SoC. When i first loaded the game up and experienced my first emission, just the sound of the storm brewing and approaching was haunting. I was running for cover as if I PERSONALLY was going to die.\n\nThe gameplay mechanics stay intact from the other 2 games, except your character feels too much like a bullet sponge. Enemies go down rather quickly, yet, you can take several shots without too much worry, as long as you have a relatively good armor suit. The emissions respawn artifacts, allowing you to continue artifact hunting in anomalies you already cleared. However, this brings more money to you. Sell the artifacts, make a bunch of money, buy an exoskeleton suit in the first map......wait...what? That's right, you can buy an exo suit from Nimble very quickly in this game if you have the funds for it. Not really that difficult to have the funds for it with the abundance of artifacts and the side objectives having a wealthy payout. Now, i know that some gamers would say, "then don't buy the exo suit." Not the point. The point is, as i stated in my review for Clear Sky, what made that game so well constructed was the pacing and balance. By Nimble giving you access to an exo suit and top notch weaponry from the get-go, it ruins the pacing of the game. Some gamers may enjoy this, sure, but in a franchise that prides itself on being difficult, is this the stalker way? Is it right to have access to this equipment so soon? Ask yourself that question when you approach Nimble when you first reach the ship in Zaton....\n\nHunger has returned, giving one of the immersive factors of SoC back. Not only that, if you find yourself hungry, it affects how quickly your stamina drains while running. Keep the food flowing to keep that stamina up. Weapons also seem to degrade very rapidly here, even when upgraded for reliability. This rubbed me the wrong way here only because it's like a false difficulty.\n\nNow, the first 2 stalkers games felt like sandbox games, but were still somewhat restricted. This game is more sandbox then the first 2 combined, yet was substantially shorter. A completionist run on Master can be completed in around 15 hours, really depending on how much artifact hunting you do. While Zaton and Jupiter (first 2 maps) had interesting designs, the new Pripyat map was where the game had the potential to REALLY shine. This sprawling city with numerous buildings that you had access to, and underground tunnels, unfortunately felt amazingly empty. You had a selection of primary objectives to do, and very few side objectives, but unfortunately, that's about it. There were only a handful of anomalies to find artifacts, and just no real reason to venture around the city. The best part of Pripyat if you ask me was the underground lab. Very creepy, claustrophobic, and dangerous....reminds me of the labs in SoC. Then, the game just kind of ends on a very unfulfilling final mission.....(NOT SPOILING).\n\nLast bit of the gameplay that many people enjoyed, but not me because of the ruining of the pace.....STASHES. Many gamers were not satisfied with the stash mechanic in the first 2 games, where you couldn't access the contents of a stash until you received the coordinates for it from a dead body. In CoP, you have access to the contents of EVERY stash in the game by default. You get some coordinates for the available stashes by completing some side objectives, but some of the stashes include very powerful weapons, food, medkits, etc. Again, while you don't actually HAVE TO access the stashes, it's just another con with the pacing and balance of the game. In SoC and CS you had to get your hands dirty to find the coordinates for the stashes, and even if you did get coordinates, they were totally randomized. If you've played the game enough to know what each stash contained in SoC, you would fight enemies until you got the coordinates for that ONE STASH you really needed. Nothing good comes easy. Gotta work for it, unlike CoP which just hands it to you.\n\nI still would recommend this game because, as i stated in my CS review, the Stalker lore grabs ahold of you. The modding community also made quite possibly the most popular Stalker mod of all 3 games for CoP...Misery. Even if this game is easier than the others, i would still highly recommend you play this vanilla first...on Master skill only. If it's too easy, try Misery.

Объединяет все лучшее из двух предыдущих.\n\nЯ три раза начинал игру заново, чтобы попробовать другой путь прохождения. А когда начал играть, спустя 3-4 часа, понял, что я совсем не продвинулся по главному заданию, а все время изучал мир и выполнял второстепенные. :)\n\nМы играем за майора Дегтерева, которому поручают расследовать мистическое крушение военных вертолетов. В итоге, нам, по ходу игры, доступны три большие локации с открытым миром, это Затон, Окрестности завода "Юпитер" и Припять. И еще куча квестовых линий за разные группировки. В игре очень классно сделали разделение мира на группировки, но, при этом, есть нейтральные зоны, где уживаются все и можно со всеми поговорить.\n\nЯ не хардкорный сталкер :)) А просто люблю изучать мир, исследовать все, поэтому в последнее свое прохождение немного отредактировал конфиг actor.ltx, чтобы дать ГГ двойное время бега (в игре огромный мир и большую часть времени приходится бегать, поэтому не люблю то, что персонаж быстро устает) и двойную переносимость (очень часто случайно подбираешь ружья с трупов и инвентарь захламляется, и бывает, что перевес случается совсем не вовремя...)\n\nВ итоге, я получил лучшее удовольствие от этой части и может пройду ее еще раз на большей сложности. :)\n\nМоя оценка: ОТЛИЧНО.

So Stalker Call of Pripyat is a fantastic Post-apocalyptic first person shooter taken place in the Zone of Alienation AKA "The Zone". Stalker Call of Pripyat is the third stalker game and features items and weapons not featured in the other Stalker games. Stalker Call of Pripyat is about a Ex-Stalker and now Military "Major Alexander Degtyarev". The major's mission is to follow the investigation of "Operation Fairway" and why it failed. Stalker Call of Pripyat is very well optimized and well made for all types of machines! The game does not feature many bugs as for maybe some crashes due to loading issues and graphical issue with mods. Mods! Oh yes, oh yes. The mods currently out for Stalker Call of Pripyat are fantastic to completely overhauling the game's graphics to makeing the game extremely hard! In conclusion: Stalker Call of Pripyat is one of the best games I've personally played, it never ceases to amaze and keep me from being bored. It has an amazing modding community! Stalker CoP may have a crash here and there, but it never disappoints me! Stalker Call of Pripyat deserves it's price.","September 12, 2013","true","288.1"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The ambiance in it is unparalelled if you removed all the enemies in it you'd still be on edge no matter where you were in it. Expecially if you add the Misery mod.

I give this a 10/10 for being a challange and keeping you on edge no matter what.\n\nBut it does have bad things about it such as the lag. As you play it seems like theres less and less lag expecially if you hang around relatively the same areas. I read up on what causes the lag and it's supposidly the AI activating and deactivating as you move accross the map.\n\nBut even with the momentary freezing and lag its still and epic game alway keeps you on edge and aways a fun challenge trying to survive the horrors of chernobol.","November 30, 2014","true","80.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/otohikoamv/recommended/41700/","otohikoamv","Dr. Just Some Homeless Guy","http://steamcommunity.com/id/otohikoamv/","223 products in account","By itself, Call of Pripyat is alright and mostly recommendable - way better than Clear Sky, but still far from delivering on the original promise of the STALKER concept. As all of them, CoP is genuinely at its best when you're left to roam freely, explore, scavenge, pick your own battles and soak in the atmosphere. The linear parts of the game are forgettable and the graphics, well, I guess there the engine is starting to show it's age. But it's pretty alright.\n\nHowever, the Misery mod for Call of Pripyat makes it an absolute hardcore survival masterpiece. It is by far the toughest, most fully-featured, and mercilessly dreary single-player survivor shooter out there - nothing comes even close. It always walks that fine line between jaw-droppingly challenging, frightening and just kind of stupidly insane, and that definitely makes it not everyone's cup of tea. The name doesn't lie - you can say a lot of things about Misery, but it's hard to call it "fun". It is a game out to murder you, both with bullets and monster claws, AND with its complex inventory/item/health/trade system which forces you to think about a lot more than just armor and bullets. Maintaining your health, stamina and the state of your gear isn't simply a matter of walking up to a couple of stations and spending some currency - oh no, this game throws one of the most arcane inventory/item/stats management systems out there at you while providing virtually no instructions, charts or stats bars, only vague indicators. For every new nifty acquisition there is a price - cheap food is radioactive, suits with gas masks constrain and muddy your vision, and carrying more than just bare necessities makes you constantly run out of stamina, even from just walking. It gives you few cues on who is friend and foe, and foes will drop you with deathly-accurate fire from long range. You will die. A lot.\n\nBut in the process of making you miserable, Misery inspires not just respect and curiosity for the Zone (like STALKER games are wont to do), but sheer awe and terror of the place. It's a game that, many times, made me basically forget everything I was doing and RUN for my (virtual) life, as far as my realistically-puny stamina would allow - not through scripted setpieces like horror games do, but through sheer incidental immersion in the gameworld, which I knew at that moment just happened to be randomly trying to murder me. Even after many days of play, it repeatedly turned me into a lowly scavenger, hunting mutated pigs for something to eat, racing NPCs to a dead bodies just to get some loot off it before they cleaned it all up, and spending as much as 2 weeks of game-time just to scrounge up enough cash for a brand new gun that - gasp - actually works and doesn't jam all the damn time!\n\nSo yeah, while I think Call of Pripyat by itself is just barely recommendable as an alright game, I give a very hearty recommendation to the Misery mod - with the warning that it takes a certain kind of masochistic player to properly enjoy its hatefully hardcore survival charm.","June 26, 2014","true","94.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Taking all the best features of Clear Sky and Shadow of Chernobyl on a single package, they got all the elements in the series just right with this game\n\nGraphically it looks the same as Clear Sky with some improved effects and texturing, and yeah it plays the same than previous stalker games but adding a lot of great features. Also, its bug free compared to clear sky, the game is definitely polished in all areas and does the one thing a game in any genre should do... and that is the grin factor. How much does it make you want to play again and again.\n\nThey also refined various elements that add value, no more fast money for selling ♥♥♥♥, you can't sell items below 75% damage.

This just scratches the surface of S.T.A.L.K.E.R., but I am certain that if you are a fan of survival horror, you will enjoy this game.","March 6, 2014","true","140.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Neverthless, it's worth playing. At the beginning Player has to build up equipment and relations to NPCs before excursing to the city of Pripyat. First part of the game is well done and offers lot of side quests and adventuring. Upon reaching Pripyat game is quite shortlived, but trip is worth seeing. However, be prepared for disappoitment: famous Pripyat Ferris Wheel is only seen at the distance.\n\nGame environments are very meticulously done and artistic work reflects a lot of CCCP-times mindset. Radioactive Zone seems to be frozen in the time, there is nothing but melancholy and decay.\n\nDownsides are minor interface issues and somewhat short game story.

People are not friendly in this game, nor should you be. In this game you will learn to survive, thinking only for yourself.\n\nI bought it recently because this game has a really good rating on steam. I played S.T.A.L.K.E.R.  Shadow of Chernobil - so I'm not new to this genre.\n\nI downloaded it, installed it (and because its from 2010) I also installed the misery 2.1.1 mod from moddb. It enhances the game with nice updated graphics but also includes a lot of ingame content/changes (very recommended)\n\nWhat did I receive for my money?\n\nA scary, dark game. Ultra high difficulty level. its no more 'learning the game' - 'EZ frags'. Its f****** damn hard to play now. It's a real challenge. Many quests, some you start, and you dont really know, what will happen. Very deep feelings, very atmospheric.  If you took some russian lessions in CS:GO, this one is like the final exam.\n\nI also want to mention, that this game is an offline-RPG game (even-though it has a multiplayer-deathmatch like thing). So its a game you can enjoy for hours, when internet is not availlable.\n\nCheers.\n\n\n","March 19, 2015","true","4.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It took me so long, I think, because I was almost afraid to play the games sometimes.  Not in a scary game sort of way but in a I-never-want-this-to-end sort of way.  I didn't want to proceed until I felt I'd fully absorbed certain elements of the story.  The choices you are forced to make in the games are compelling and have had a lasting effect on me.  I'm am a little sad that the journey is over for now.\n\nCoP seemed to differ from the previous games in that it was a fair amount more approachable to newcomers.  The first two games were unforgiving and had a marginally tough learning curve.  GSC prettied up the HUD a little, which made managing your character less of a chore.  But the gameplay was still the awesome gameplay from the first two games and the story was just as compelling as SoC.\n\nI can't recommend these games enough.

S.T.A.L.K.E.R is a Horror/Survival FP Shooter game developed by GSC Game World.\n\nGeneral Information and story:\n\nYou start as an USS Major Degtyarev and you are sent in to ''The Zone'' to investigate a failed operation called ''Operation Fairway''. This operation was planned to take the the Chernobyl NPP by force from the current forces holding it known only by the name ''Monolith''. The operation was a failure and all the stingray helicopters crashed in a suspicious way. So there you  are and you're mission is clear, but as you advance in the story it gets everything but clear, the pilots that are dead or killed all died in an extraordinary way except for those who died by the impact of the crashing helicopter, and some of the helicopters appear to be disfuctional even before they hit the ground.\nYou're mission is a solo effort to find out why Operation Fairway was a failure, but as you progress through The Zone you have to work among the local stalkers which are the people wondering around and exploring The Zone brought there by various reasons. You may choose to work alongside the stalkers or rob them as a bandit either way you will have buddies. Stalkers make the most money, which is a luxury in The Zone, by hunting Artifacts which are items formed in an anomalous area, after getting artifacts they sell them to traders who trade them to the outside world. Artifacts have strange abilities like healing abilities. The Zone is a strange and dangerous place which makes the majors mission anything but easy. The Zone is full of dangerous anomalies, radiation, bandits, madmen, criminals and even mutated animals and people!\nYou're mission leads you to the center of The Zone to city of Pripyat where you meet up with the remaining soldiers from Operation Fairway, There you can choose to do something about the Monolith and soon find out more about how the helicopters crashed. As it turns out the monolith have a secret weapon which works with electric energy from artifacts and uses batteries for ''magazines'' the weapon is called Gauss Rifle and the helicopters were shot down. in the end you are given a option to leave The Zone or to find out more about the Gauss Rifle and the Monolith or about The Zone, so the story is only so good how mutch time you put in to it. Like any other game you can just rush it out or take time with it and S.T.A.L.K.E.R is one where you should totally invest some time otherwise it's easily looked over because of it's graphical issues and it's cheap look, but the truth is S.T.A.L.K.E.R is anything but cheap! It may lack a perfect story but the atmosphere and feel is like any other, S.T.A.L.K.E.R has many intersting side missions and stories and the fact that it loosely is related to reality and has a realistic feel to it makes it an unmatched expirience in this kind of genre.\n\nGameplay:\n\nGameplay of S.T.A.L.K.E.R is very unique in my oppinion, it combines FPS gameplay with survival elements such as hunger and radiation sickness and the need to sleep with horror and even RPG elements such as simple stats, different weapons and armor, economy, side missions and exploring. Combined with the enviroment the gameplay fits like a glove even if it has a few downsides. The downsides are mostly minor things such as repeated lines from NPC's and buggy animations, other than that it's O.K. All in all the gameplay is something quite different from other compareable games and in a good way! S.T.A.L.K.E.R Call Of Pripyat can attract fans of many genres. Multiplayer is nothing special, you're typical DM, TDM witch areas from the singleplayer.\n\nGraphics:\n\nThe game was first released in 2009 so the graphics are a bit old but i wouldn't say that they look terrible, they aren't the diamond either there is a lot of room for improvement in here but especially in the animations. The game uses the X-Ray engine and has been updated to version 1.6 with DirectX 11. The games graphics can be enhanced with several mods that are avaliable through the web. I haven't found any major problems that mods have not been able to fix.\n\nOther:\n\nOne thing that must be said about Call Of Pripyat is the large quantity of different mods that are avaliable, apparently S.T.A.L.K.E.R fans are loyal to game and have made a lot of great mods for people to play. Allmost every problem and aspect of the game can be fixed/enhanced with large or small mods. I recommend playing the game with one major mod before declaring it a piece of trash.\n\nVerdict:\n\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R Call Of Pripyat is  allmost a ground breaking title. Call Of Pripyat lacks the appearence to catch peoples eyes but is a beautyful game in many aspects. S.T.A.L.K.E.R in my oppinion has no problems the mods can't fix. All in all it is a refreshing title and a great expirience for a fan of any genre and has a feel and atmosphere like any other. Story is nothing special but keeps you interested to the end plus S.T.A.L.K.E.R has many great side missions. You can easily put 40 to 50 hours to this game and still not have played every little bit, depending on your difficulty and playstyle of course.\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R Call of Pripyat is excellent singleplayer expirience!\n\n9/10","June 5, 2014","true","66.5"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

While the engine is beginning to show its age outdoors at long distances, the lighting effects, foliage, clouds, and especially the decaying urban environments all look fantastic. I have only played the game maxed with DX10, so I can't attest to how great the DX11 features look. However, even so, the game looks and plays phenomenally.\n\nSound-\nThe music and atmospheric noises are as good as ever, and the voice acting is decent, which is good for a game from Ukraine.\n\nGameplay-\nThey've really integrated features that worked from Clear Sky with features from Shadow of Chernobyl. You can upgrade weapons and repair them, using special calibration tools (which are a bit too difficult to find), but ballistics feels much more like it did in the first, and the focus is much less on combat with humans and much more on exploring and finding mutants.

You start undercover in a new area of The Zone and you're immediately sent into surviving since there is a long way until your first objective and safe area.\nThe game picks up from where STALKER SoC left it and has improved graphics,map size and keeps all the changes Clear Sky had.\nIn CoP the devs removed the quests for data required for upgrading your gear and they added tools that the mechanics can use(read the quests for instructions where to find them or Google it ). The user can easily explore and he can find hidden stashes no matter if they have or don't have the coords on his PDA.The game has only 3 huge areas with good quests, achievements, underground laboratories, new weapons and new information the military has left behind.It's your decision what to do with the information found and who do you want to help.\nAt the end of the game the user encounters a familiar face that brings the knowlege of The Zone.\n\nPros\n-Exoskeleton can now be upgraded and the user can run.

It took me so long, I think, because I was almost afraid to play the games sometimes.  Not in a scary game sort of way but in a I-never-want-this-to-end sort of way.  I didn't want to proceed until I felt I'd fully absorbed certain elements of the story.  The choices you are forced to make in the games are compelling and have had a lasting effect on me.  I'm am a little sad that the journey is over for now.\n\nCoP seemed to differ from the previous games in that it was a fair amount more approachable to newcomers.  The first two games were unforgiving and had a marginally tough learning curve.  GSC prettied up the HUD a little, which made managing your character less of a chore.  But the gameplay was still the awesome gameplay from the first two games and the story was just as compelling as SoC.\n\nI can't recommend these games enough.

It has this attraction though. Perhaps the sci-fi lore, or the freedom to do as I please in a world that feels the same freedom.

While the engine is beginning to show its age outdoors at long distances, the lighting effects, foliage, clouds, and especially the decaying urban environments all look fantastic. I have only played the game maxed with DX10, so I can't attest to how great the DX11 features look. However, even so, the game looks and plays phenomenally.\n\nSound-\nThe music and atmospheric noises are as good as ever, and the voice acting is decent, which is good for a game from Ukraine.\n\nGameplay-\nThey've really integrated features that worked from Clear Sky with features from Shadow of Chernobyl. You can upgrade weapons and repair them, using special calibration tools (which are a bit too difficult to find), but ballistics feels much more like it did in the first, and the focus is much less on combat with humans and much more on exploring and finding mutants. Factions are in place, but no one will attack you on sight unless you've made an enemy of them. Even bandits. This makes for some interesting interactions out in the wild.

With mods it is waaaay more enjoyable. Arsenal with 60 new armos and 200 new weapons is great. Atmosphere 3 is usually included with all of the larger mods. But, Misery. Dear God, Misery. It scares people off because its incredibly difficult. It shouldn't though, it's extremely immersive, letting you live an actual life in the zone, doing what you want to do as a Loner Stalker. Misery is if anything, playable forever, there is so much micromanaging, as far as waking up in the morning, planning on observing a certain area, deciding to go in for the kill, and planning your raid, to cleaning your weapon, to setting up camp for the night and just putting food on the table, to watching your radiation and other needs, to planning a hunting trip to make reap a god kill and harvest the goods. I've been playing this game for a long time, I live for immesive realism games, ArmA, DayZ, Ranger Hardcore on Metro, Master difficulty on the vanilla S.T.A.L.K.E.R., never have I actually woken up in real life, got showered, breakfast, etc. And decided to plan out my ingame day over a real life cup of coffee on a Saturday morning. If you want something real, something that makes you feel like you have to earn it, all of these games, you play ♥♥♥ the main character, gunslinging, medkit addicted, bullet eating protagonist with a misson and everyone stepping out of your way for your story the world revolving around you. But not Misery, in Misery your just some everyday stalker, walking in eating your flesh (the ingame monster) bacon wrapped in brown papar to keep the grease from dripping (actual description, immersion is life) planning on going for that artifact today, or that camp, the rounds your taking for your gun, the equipment you'll need for that area, maybe a sleeping bag and a safe place, incase youre out ill nightfall or an emission happens all of the sudden. In order to be a badass gunslinging veteran stalker, you had to train yourself and learn to be a badass stalker, absolutely no handholding in the mod. Misery will make you feel like you're there, but its not for everybody, the mod is infamously difficult, harder than Dark Souls, harder than the original Ninja Gaiden (well maybe not THAT hard *cringes at Ninja Gaiden*), at any moment something could leap from the marshes or shadows, whether it be a enemy stalker bullet, or the claws of a bloodsucker, if you're not on your toes with some real friggin' reflexes, you will die. A lot of times, no matter how good you are, sometimes you just get unlucky and a stary bullet will nail your head ending your journey in the zone. If your a serious immersion freak, wondering how you would really do in the zone (with basic knowledge of weaponry and cooking and medicenes) Misery is for you. If you like things tough, but still want to be a bit on top of everything else, try Master difficulty with Arenal Overload. However, the game is enjoyable and incredible regardless, 10/10!","April 19, 2015","true","134.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

Although it has fewer areas to explore, the amount of detail in each is staggering and the design is much more open, leading to less running into fences and what not. The addition of Blowouts is a great touch, and the roleplaying takes a queue from Fallout this time around, lending itself to more decisions on how to side with, and the benefits for doing so.\n\nYou can also repair weapons and the mods you can acquire are much, much more numerous and functional, beyond simple silencer + scope + gl. A lot of dummied out features make a return, from unused weapons, armor, enemise, and lore-elements. The anomalies are also much more dangerous.\n\nAgain, the AI is a complaint. It is equal parts smart (dogs will form packs against you and hunt you down, human ai will flank you) and dumb (human ai in an emission has weird priorities, choosing to casually walk to safe cover rather than running like mad).\n\nWell worth the purchase.","December 27, 2011","true","83.6"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","2"

Misery is if anything, playable forever, there is so much micromanaging, as far as waking up in the morning, planning on observing a certain area, deciding to go in for the kill, and planning your raid, to cleaning your weapon, to setting up camp for the night and just putting food on the table, to watching your radiation and other needs, to planning a hunting trip to make reap a god kill and harvest the goods. I've been playing this game for a long time, I live for immesive realism games, ArmA, DayZ, Ranger Hardcore on Metro, Master difficulty on the vanilla S.T.A.L.K.E.R., never have I actually woken up in real life, got showered, breakfast, etc. And decided to plan out my ingame day over a real life cup of coffee on a Saturday morning. If you want something real, something that makes you feel like you have to earn it, all of these games, you play ♥♥♥ the main character, gunslinging, medkit addicted, bullet eating protagonist with a misson and everyone stepping out of your way for your story the world revolving around you. But not Misery, in Misery your just some everyday stalker, walking in eating your flesh (the ingame monster) bacon wrapped in brown papar to keep the grease from dripping (actual description, immersion is life) planning on going for that artifact today, or that camp, the rounds your taking for your gun, the equipment you'll need for that area, maybe a sleeping bag and a safe place, incase youre out ill nightfall or an emission happens all of the sudden. In order to be a badass gunslinging veteran stalker, you had to train yourself and learn to be a badass stalker, absolutely no handholding in the mod. Misery will make you feel like you're there, but its not for everybody, the mod is infamously difficult, harder than Dark Souls, harder than the original Ninja Gaiden (well maybe not THAT hard *cringes at Ninja Gaiden*), at any moment something could leap from the marshes or shadows, whether it be a enemy stalker bullet, or the claws of a bloodsucker, if you're not on your toes with some real friggin' reflexes, you will die. A lot of times, no matter how good you are, sometimes you just get unlucky and a stary bullet will nail your head ending your journey in the zone. If your a serious immersion freak, wondering how you would really do in the zone (with basic knowledge of weaponry and cooking and medicenes) Misery is for you. If you like things tough, but still want to be a bit on top of everything else, try Master difficulty with Arenal Overload. However, the game is enjoyable and incredible regardless, 10/10!","April 19, 2015","true","134.2"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","1"

This game is not a "go out there, bang bang, thousand hostiles down in section one alpha" kinda game, you have an inventory system, where you can only carry 50 kg of room, you have to decide which is more important, weapons, ammo, food or med-kits. You WILL run out of bullets quickly unless you can aim for the head, I'm a bad aim so I carry 100-200+ ammo for my assault rifles, the mutants don't seem to deal as much damage as they would in say.. Shadow of Chernobyl, but still stay clear of them, your armor and weapons deteriorate too.\n\nArtifact hunting! This should be rather easy (in the starting map) artifacts are found in anomalies, spots where the laws of nature and physics had been corrupted, these anomalies are very dangerous to human health, in these anomalies are artifacts, which are used to be either sold or used to help you get past an anomaly or increase your base health, or remove radiation, be wary, most artifacts harm you but at the same time can help you.\n\nThis is all I can say, Duty is standing behind me trying to get me from typing this, so I must go!

Call of Pripyat fixes all these problems admirably and delivers a far more focused and streamlined version of what is already my favorite PC game. While it's not quite as "Special" as the original, CoP is a superior game in almost every way when compared to its predecessor. The game is as stable as a brick house, the upgrade system is simple yet satisfying and worthwhile, the story is more involving and fleshed out, and while several quests do repeat, their only purpose is to fatten up your wallet which, thanks to the rebalanced economy, is entirely optional (no more 200000 RU Exoskeleton!).

Clear sky is longer, but more flawed.  This game is shorter, and is only 3 areas (really, REALLY big areas), but the game feels more alive.  The quests are better overall, and for once you get to form a group of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.s, although only for one mission (nothing like the zombie mission from Clear Sky).  The mutants are scarier than ever, and the new chimera is a fearsome beast.  The origins of the monolith faction are finally clearly explained (although clever players knew what was up already).  If you haven't beaten clear sky then the true origins of the zone will remain a mystery to you in this game, with a cursory intro and a couple of dialogue options here and there being your only explanation (although it is not at all central to the plot).  The plot is fairly weak, but fun so it doesn't really matter.  what is really good is the world crafting, it is really fun just running around collecting artifacts, hunting mutants, and completing misssions.  Collecting and upgrading different guns can also be really fun, but experienced players will quickly find some guns are Much better than others.  The atmosphere and sound is top notch, I highly recommend if you like environmental horror games and fps games.","July 19, 2015","true","14.4"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

The Zone is ever so dangerous, and emissions happen every now and then. In this final chapter the game isnt so different. Although the gameplay area is totally new consisting of three big maps (it is smaller than its predecessors, so the storyline is shorter), there are few other changes since the last game. Call of Pripyat is propably the most stable one of the three, which is a good thing.\nThe Protagonist is part of a military investigation, but he is not considered enemy among other stalkers. The main storyline mission is about finding the remains of crashed military helicopters, and determing what happened to them. Of course there are lots of side missions, and places to visit just for laughs. The CNPP is not involved in the game, instead the final destination is the city of Pripyat.\nThere are less mods made to this game, probably because it is the newest in the gameseries, but most of the mods are compatible with the steam version, and they will enhance the gameplay experience quite a bit.\nDefinitely better than Clear Sky but cant compete with Shadow of Chernobyl.","July 14, 2015","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

You have some task to do (that's why you arrived here), and you do it. But same as Skyrim, you can just forget about it, and do whatever you want. You can pick up some detector tool, take some medkits and go look for artifacts in anomalies, while finding your path between bone-crushing/acid-melting/electricity-striking/etc anomalies by throwing metallic bolts. All this to find artefacts - some usual objects which got abnormal effects due to being in proximity of anomaly. And then you sell them, get better gear, get better at finding artefacts, help local factions in their wars, get some bandit ♥♥♥ kicked, drink vodka while planning very dangerous expedition, find crashed UAV, headshot zombies and run from pseudogiants....\n\nSo, basically like Skyrim with guns and stalkers. And as mentioned in other reviews, nobody tells you what to do. You will have to figure out everything - how to find artefacts, where and how to fix and upgrade guns (sometimes they can't upgrade your gun because of being sober) and etc...\n\nGood luck, stalker.","January 18","true","60.8"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Call of Pripyat is by far the best in the series when it comes to guns and ccombat. Finding a gun you really like and being able to upgrade your weapon to how you want and putting your life and trust into one gun to help survive out in the harsh world of STALKER makes the atmosphere and immersion far beyond any FPS game has ever even came close to. The world of Pripyat makes for a great RPG and creepy atmoshere. Creeping around at night in the dark with all the horrible sounds going on around you makes you really appreciate a good atmosphere in a game and also that your gun is fully loaded and your reflexes are fast enough to be ready for what could be coming at your through the darkness at any moment. Open world and plenty of side quests and NPC to make for a great RPG and enough guns to keep you playing for hours. Although the story starts off pretty good, it ends pretty weak compared to Shadow of Chernobyl, which has an amazing story with 13 endings! DDo yourself a favor and buy the whole series and then download STALKER Complete for each game. These are bug fix mods and tweaks. They fix most if the major glitches and problems the vanilla games have. Also, check out LURK ffor Shadow Chernobyl and Misery for Call of Pripyat for the best possible way to play STALKER - Shadow of Chernoyble and STALKER Call of Pripyat.","April 9, 2014","true","94.7"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Call of Pripyat fixes all these problems admirably and delivers a far more focused and streamlined version of what is already my favorite PC game. While it's not quite as "Special" as the original, CoP is a superior game in almost every way when compared to its predecessor. The game is as stable as a brick house, the upgrade system is simple yet satisfying and worthwhile, the story is more involving and fleshed out, and while several quests do repeat, their only purpose is to fatten up your wallet which, thanks to the rebalanced economy, is entirely optional (no more 200000 RU Exoskeleton!).

Call of Pripyat fixes all these problems admirably and delivers a far more focused and streamlined version of what is already my favorite PC game. While it's not quite as "Special" as the original, CoP is a superior game in almost every way when compared to its predecessor. The game is as stable as a brick house, the upgrade system is simple yet satisfying and worthwhile, the story is more involving and fleshed out, and while several quests do repeat, their only purpose is to fatten up your wallet which, thanks to the rebalanced economy, is entirely optional (no more 200000 RU Exoskeleton!).

The main storyline mission is about finding the remains of crashed military helicopters, and determing what happened to them. Of course there are lots of side missions, and places to visit just for laughs. The CNPP is not involved in the game, instead the final destination is the city of Pripyat.\nThere are less mods made to this game, probably because it is the newest in the gameseries, but most of the mods are compatible with the steam version, and they will enhance the gameplay experience quite a bit.\nDefinitely better than Clear Sky but cant compete with Shadow of Chernobyl.","July 14, 2015","true","13.0"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Compared to the previous entries in GSC's fabulous series, it is the most stable by far, most graphically appealing, and perhaps the scariest.  The AI is superb.  Beyond superb.  I remember reading somewhere that in Shadow of Chernobyl, they had to tone the AI down to make the game playable.  In its original state, an npc could have easily beaten the game itself without player influence.  It was that good.  And it still is amazing.  GSC managed to take probably the best AI model I've seen and place it in the scariest, darkest, and outlandish things imaginable(and unimaginable for that matter).  When placed into monsters that make villains like Chris Walker and SPC-106 seem like drinking buddies, it puts you into ITS ballpark.  In S.T.A.L.K.E.R., you don't get to smirk at stupid decisions by bandits or monsters.  In fact, I've been outsmarted by the AI.  And that doesn't happen often.  The AI isn't supposed to outsmart the player in video games.  YOU'RE supposed to outsmart IT.  GSC essentially threw that to the wind.  I'll give an example.  In one of the quests, you have to hunt down a creature called a Bloodsucker.  Which is already a name to run away from really fast.  So I packed up my AK, a few bottles of Vodka, a few first aid kits, some bandages, and headed out.  Aside from distant gunshots and screams that you just can't mistake for anything besides a human being torn apart, it was a pleasant enough day.  I reach the hunting spot.  Now, Bloodsuckers can turn invisible.  The standard way to deal with them is to get them to chase you in a straight line, then flip around and unload assault rifle fire in their faces.  The bloodsucker however decided to run away from ME.  So I chased after it and it led me on a wild goose chase around the map until we reached the swamps again.  Guess what had happened while we were gone.  Its friends had formed an ambush, while the first creature tired me out and lured me back to give them all an easy kill.  And that was the AI's doing.  No scripting, no cutscene, no quicktime event.  It did that all on its own.  And that's only one of the nightmares you will encounter in this game.  Most horror games scare you by giving you no defenses or weapons.  You're only choice is to hide or run.  In this, you have plenty of weapons.  And I still get scared out of my wits while I play this.  Because in GSC's rendering of Chernobyl, all the weapons in the world aren't going to give you an advantage.  Overall it has a solid storyline, believable characters, and fun sidequests.  So in short, it's probably one of the best games I've ever played.  And if you ever start to get bored of the bounty of content in Call of Pripyat, the amount of player made mods will take care of that.  To make a long story short, this game is worth EVERY. SINGLE. PENNY.  Of course, if you don't like games where you're not a god, where the world isn't at your mercy, don't buy this.  Because in S.T.A.L.K.E.R, you aren't god.  You're mortal just like everyone else.","March 13","true","108.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

It's an unstable, bug-laden, often-mistranslated with cheating AI piece of game, but god does it do something good.\n\nThe ambience, the stress, the setting, the mechanics... Everything that makes an open-world survival game great, way before the recent survival craze on steam. The game is hard as balls by concept, and would have it no other way.\n\nIf it reminds you of the Metro series, well, there's a good reason: much of the same people who worked for GSC Game World fo the Stalker series went to do Metro for 4A games. In a sad turn of events, GSC Game World screwed over its employees, and has basically died since this game has come out, so we might never see a S.T.A.L.K.E.R. game again.\n\nCall of Pripyat is arguably the best game in the series due to it relative stability and more mature gameplay mechanics, where Shadow of Chernobyl feels rough around the edges and Clear Sky is just instable and buggy as balls. The main character story was more interesting in Shadow, was utterly uninteresting in Clear Sky, and is mildly interesting this time around in CoP due to a few other characters,,,\n\nYou like FPSes, survival games, getting out of here stalker, open-world games, russians swearing, looking at X-Ray engine crash dumps, and crouching in radioactive mud because you're being sniped at midnight by bandits?

While the story isn't ground breaking, unlike Clear Sky, or Shadow of Chernobyl at times, it isn't pretencious. The story's very simple: You are a covert military agent infiltrated in the zone as a lone Stalker, who is sent to find out the cause of mysterious crashes of multiple military Mi-24 choppers, and save the eventual survivors, if any. The ending has a loose end, because then-cancelled Stalker 2 project, should have a story that continues from the CoP ending.\n\nIf you're a fan of STALKER franchise, you need to finish CoP before Stalker 2 releases, hopefully.","May 6","true","16.3"," 1 person found this review helpful","0","1","1","0","0"

Yes there is heaps of stuff to do, I agree but I've played this game say 3-4 times over? 3 times being unmodded and the fourth with the Misery mod and honestly it does get boring, after doing all the side quests and the main missions, it really gets repetative after doing them so many times and some scenes or areas that were fun, misleading and scary in some cases are not so anymore.\n\nBut yes I reccommend this game for sure, I'd give it a 9/10 because of its settings the mutants and the factions have always been something great in my opinion. I really enjoy the "theme" of the game I guess? There were countless guns, not literally... I did find every gun there was to find, either way there were a LOT of different guns to buy and use. If you do all the side quests as well as the main mission and if you were to take your time you'd probably be looking at say a good 20 hours + of gameplay.\n\nThis isn't the game, unfortunately I'd be playing more than 2-3 times at the most.

The story is weaker, (I usually never explain the plot because I don't want to spoil plots) the Gamplay however is much stronger and more better. The maps are much bigger but 3 total Areas? Seriously? The graphics are dusty on the medium settings. The Upgrades actually assist in gameplay, the Characters are unique and likable, however the AI is a mixed bag, Dialogue is well written but having only like, 5 Voice actors over at GSC annoys me. Very glitchy but you can mod it to what ever degree you want. Stashes no longer require pressing the e key over everything that resembles a corpse. But the Main problem of this game is that it is way too easy. Stick the difficulty up to Veteran or Master if you want a challenge. Your health regenerates very quickly, Money, ammo, and items are easier to obtain, and bullets are so ♥♥♥♥-weak to you but your bullets are rockets to the enemy.\n\nMod this game to whatever complaint you have, and you will have a more solid game.\n\n7.1/10","December 27, 2013","true","549.5"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

"http://steamcommunity.com/id/nameloCc/recommended/41700/","nameloCc","nameloC","http://steamcommunity.com/id/nameloCc/","317 products in account","As a franchise, GSC Game World's Stalker has come a long way. That the original Shadow of Chernobyl was actually completed and released to the public at all after a seemingly endless string of delays was a bit of a surprise. Sure, it was rough around the edges, but no other game out there offered such an intoxicating mix of horror and bleak beauty like Stalker and the irradiated wastes of its setting. While the follow-up prequel, Clear Sky, was a bit of a disappointment in how it trimmed out a bunch of elements that helped Stalker stand out, Call of Pripyat ditches a lot of the changes made and returns to the series' roots. It's not quite the revelatory experience Shadow of Chernobyl was, but it hits all the right notes for fans of the original and anyone else who values mood in their games and finds entertainment in being scared out of their socks. It also, thankfully, isn't nearly as buggy.\n\nTo get the timeline all straightened out, Call of Pripyat is the second title to follow Shadow of Chernobyl and takes place after the events of the first. The game is set in the Zone, a tract of land surrounding the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in which all life has been corrupted and twisted into hideous and deadly forms. Frightening and powerful creatures dwell in isolated underground testing labs and caverns, the landscape is full of dangerous traps that spout fire from the ground and trigger damaging windstorms, and every once in a while an emission blasts across the land wiping out anything silly enough to neglect shelter. Despite the fact that this land sounds entirely inhospitable, it draws fortune seekers in search of curios called artifacts that tend to spawn right in the middle of the anomalous traps. As a result, groups of these stalkers bunch together in whatever safe areas they can find, such as in rusted husks of beached ships, abandoned train stations, and the crumbling remains of Pripyat. The mysterious circumstances surrounding the propagation and sustainment of the Zone have also created several subgroups within the area, including factions that want to wipe it off the planet entirely and those that think its uniqueness alone justifies a need to preserve it.\n\nIn this game you play as Alex Degtyarev, a new character and part of a military mission to discover what happened to a number of helicopters sent into The Zone following the climactic events of the first title. Everyone was curious as to what kind of power beat at the setting's center, and after watching Call of Pripyat's opening cutscene it's clear the military didn't have a lot of success finding an answer. As you comb the grounds in search of the damaged military vehicles and their crew members, you'll pass through three large areas comprised of toxic marshes, desiccated fields, decaying industrial facilities and urban wastes, all of which have their own set of side quests and feature plenty of scares and entertaining challenges.\n\nThe game is structured like a role-playing title, with primary missions and quest rewards and a trading system where you'll repair guns, buy ammunition and medical supplies, wrap cuts with bandages, and upgrade your gear the further you go. There's no leveling or experience point systems, however, so the power of your character is more directly determined by the kinds of equipment you're carrying around. Like Shadow of Chernobyl, when you start out, you're going to be incredibly vulnerable to the dangers present in the Zone. You'll also be poor. Talking to NPCs, taking on quests, and hunting down and trading artifacts for cash are your best options for upgrades, which in Call of Pripyat is a more interesting process than in the original.\n\nThat's because the modification system built into Clear Sky has been imported here, meaning if you talk to specific NPCs and give them what they want, they'll offer services that can do things like upgrade the reliability of your weapon, improve its accuracy, or boost the defensive parameters of your armor. Even by implementing these upgrades, you'll still need to keep an eye on your gear's condition. Call of Pripyat is a game where a sense of realism is crucial to the overall tone of the world, and as such that means your armor can break down and weapons degrade with use. Eventually, guns you've ignored will deteriorate and start to jam with such frequency that there's no point in using them anymore. You'll also need to monitor radiation levels and bring scraps of food on your journey to keep Alex in fighting shape, since it really doesn't take very long for a skittering mutant to claw the life from you.\n\nThough you do still interact with Duty and Freedom factions in the game, the flimsy faction balance system from Clear Sky has been tossed out for Call of Pripyat. The result is a more natural feel to the interplay of AI systems across the Zone. You'll see wandering bands of humans get into some large-scale fights against ravenous packs of mutated dogs and hulking boar creatures. You'll hear this combat in the distance and get the sense that this world is alive and chaotic and exists independently of your actions, which reinforces the elements of realism built into the game's weapon and armor systems and the general vulnerability of your character as you scamper from firefight to firefight.\n\nGuns in Stalker are not incredibly accurate, something that holds true of your weapons and those of your humanoid opponents. Bullets spray everywhere during a fight, encouraging you to crouch down behind cover and fire in quick bursts. It means you'll need to pay attention every time you go to shoot. If you panic and try to fire from the hip while on the move, you're going to get punctured and shredded in seconds. You need to be surgically precise, even after you've purchased upgrades, if you want to stay alive while out on your own. It adds to the authentic feel of the world that by using each weapon, you'll notice a difference in feel almost immediately. The variation between each firearm contributes to a greater sense of growing power and progression as you come across better equipment, keeping you motivated on your journey toward the Zone's secrets.\n\nIf you're not questing, you'll find this world interesting enough to make simply wandering around to see the sights and searching for the occasional artifact entertaining. The windswept slopes and unsetting, icy soundtrack never let you relax, building a tension that keeps your attention glued to the events onsceen even if there's nothing happening except for wind swishing through tall grass. It's the threat of action that hooks you and draws you forward, since you never know if something like a cloaked bloodsucker or loping snork is waiting for you behind the next rise as rainstorms wash across the fields and day turns to night. It's an environment built with such clarity of vision, that feels so alien and hostile that simply managing to survive a journey from one location to the next feels like an accomplishment, a feeling amplified greatly when you manage to actually uncover a cool new item or pocket of bizarre activity.\n\nUnfortunately, there are elements that eat away at the atmosphere of the world, and those are the voice acting, quest text and delivery. The English voice acting in the game is from time to time decent, but frequently irritatingly overenthusiastic. I'm not looking to hear "Hey, bro!" screamed with the cadence of someone who just slammed a line of Jager bombs after I nearly lost my head in a snork nest. A lot of text is also copy and pasted between conversation trees with non-essential NPCs, which can be distracting, and the overall delivery of the story is very straightforward. So, if you want to learn all you can about the zone, it means digging through a lot of limp text in chat boxes.\n\n10/10","September 4, 2013","true","13.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

In Shadow of Chernobyl (SoC), the entire game had a sense of mystery about it, a kind of unanswered questions vibe. It was a question of surviving the endless horrors of the Zone, of loud rain and calamitous thunder at night, and of breathtaking sunrises in the morning, as one gazes out at the brooding wilderness. It also encompassed a sense of massive and epic scale, as the player struggles for mere survival while the Monolith elite jealously guard the entrance to the Sarcophagus while the Ukrainian Military pours in all their best fighters, special forces armed to the teeth and guarded from above by a fleet of Mi-24 Hinds, to force their way through. Unsettling screams and distant gunfire at night, beautiful blood-red sunrises in the barren hills near the Army Warehouses, the haunting soundtrack of Cordon filling one's ears as stalkers wander aimlessly through the irradiated meadows, vengeance, melancholy, fear, and grandeur. THAT is the essence of SoC. Call of Pripyat gives off a different atmosphere. From the moment the player spawns, as he gazes out over the beautifully rendered swamps of Zaton, one gets the sense of opportunity. The Zone has been tamed, and there's money to be made here. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, but it does somewhat lessen the more emotional experience of SoC. Soundtrack was good. Weapons were unique and fun each in their own way, with customization available for most (they weakened my dear Ots-14! Waaaaaaaaaaaaaah!). Armor was plentiful, with many choices to pick (although no Merc Suit or Skat 9M). Characters were well-rounded, combat worked like a charm, the missions were sometimes tedious but on the whole more varied than the original game. I also particularly enjoyed the Factional Strife which one could get involved in in Call of Pripyat. I only wish that SoC had it. Playing the Loners and Bandits off on one another, or eschewing both in favor of the shadowy information dealer Owl makes the game much more lively, with some high-stakes plays to heighten the standing of your favoured faction. It is a pity one could not join the Mercenaries under Hatchet (what a swell guy!). I also liked the very idea of working with a fellow whose trade is the bartering of information (a valuable commodity in a place such as this!). I enjoyed the fact that some of these missions helped give one a sense of the scope of the Mercenary activities in the Zone, for they are without a doubt the most secretive faction.  Apparently they have some influential friends/allies. On the downside, I did not enjoy the fact that each weapon needed to be repaired before selling- this made the game much more difficult, especially since one needed to buy certain items in order to progress in the game. On the whole a fantastic game- not quite SoC, but worthy in its' own right.\n9.9/10","September 8, 2015","true","32.8"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

As you comb the grounds in search of the damaged military vehicles and their crew members, you'll pass through three large areas comprised of toxic marshes, desiccated fields, decaying industrial facilities and urban wastes, all of which have their own set of side quests and feature plenty of scares and entertaining challenges.\n\nThe game is structured like a role-playing title, with primary missions and quest rewards and a trading system where you'll repair guns, buy ammunition and medical supplies, wrap cuts with bandages, and upgrade your gear the further you go. There's no leveling or experience point systems, however, so the power of your character is more directly determined by the kinds of equipment you're carrying around. Like Shadow of Chernobyl, when you start out, you're going to be incredibly vulnerable to the dangers present in the Zone. You'll also be poor. Talking to NPCs, taking on quests, and hunting down and trading artifacts for cash are your best options for upgrades, which in Call of Pripyat is a more interesting process than in the original.\n\nThat's because the modification system built into Clear Sky has been imported here, meaning if you talk to specific NPCs and give them what they want, they'll offer services that can do things like upgrade the reliability of your weapon, improve its accuracy, or boost the defensive parameters of your armor. Even by implementing these upgrades, you'll still need to keep an eye on your gear's condition. Call of Pripyat is a game where a sense of realism is crucial to the overall tone of the world, and as such that means your armor can break down and weapons degrade with use. Eventually, guns you've ignored will deteriorate and start to jam with such frequency that there's no point in using them anymore. You'll also need to monitor radiation levels and bring scraps of food on your journey to keep Alex in fighting shape, since it really doesn't take very long for a skittering mutant to claw the life from you.\n\nThough you do still interact with Duty and Freedom factions in the game, the flimsy faction balance system from Clear Sky has been tossed out for Call of Pripyat. The result is a more natural feel to the interplay of AI systems across the Zone. You'll see wandering bands of humans get into some large-scale fights against ravenous packs of mutated dogs and hulking boar creatures. You'll hear this combat in the distance and get the sense that this world is alive and chaotic and exists independently of your actions, which reinforces the elements of realism built into the game's weapon and armor systems and the general vulnerability of your character as you scamper from firefight to firefight.\n\nGuns in Stalker are not incredibly accurate, something that holds true of your weapons and those of your humanoid opponents. Bullets spray everywhere during a fight, encouraging you to crouch down behind cover and fire in quick bursts. It means you'll need to pay attention every time you go to shoot. If you panic and try to fire from the hip while on the move, you're going to get punctured and shredded in seconds. You need to be surgically precise, even after you've purchased upgrades, if you want to stay alive while out on your own. It adds to the authentic feel of the world that by using each weapon, you'll notice a difference in feel almost immediately. The variation between each firearm contributes to a greater sense of growing power and progression as you come across better equipment, keeping you motivated on your journey toward the Zone's secrets.\n\nIf you're not questing, you'll find this world interesting enough to make simply wandering around to see the sights and searching for the occasional artifact entertaining. The windswept slopes and unsetting, icy soundtrack never let you relax, building a tension that keeps your attention glued to the events onsceen even if there's nothing happening except for wind swishing through tall grass. It's the threat of action that hooks you and draws you forward, since you never know if something like a cloaked bloodsucker or loping snork is waiting for you behind the next rise as rainstorms wash across the fields and day turns to night. It's an environment built with such clarity of vision, that feels so alien and hostile that simply managing to survive a journey from one location to the next feels like an accomplishment, a feeling amplified greatly when you manage to actually uncover a cool new item or pocket of bizarre activity.\n\nUnfortunately, there are elements that eat away at the atmosphere of the world, and those are the voice acting, quest text and delivery. The English voice acting in the game is from time to time decent, but frequently irritatingly overenthusiastic. I'm not looking to hear "Hey, bro!" screamed with the cadence of someone who just slammed a line of Jager bombs after I nearly lost my head in a snork nest. A lot of text is also copy and pasted between conversation trees with non-essential NPCs, which can be distracting, and the overall delivery of the story is very straightforward. So, if you want to learn all you can about the zone, it means digging through a lot of limp text in chat boxes.\n\n10/10","September 4, 2013","true","13.2"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful 2 people found this review funny","67","2","3","2","0"

I cant compare it to anything because nothing comes to mind. It feeels like a predecessor to Metro but I think that is only because they are both Russian. So thats not fair. But its precisely because it cant be easily grouped in with other games that you should buy it.\n\nHere are the mistakes I made that you should avoid. Do not immediately mod the game. It will be tempting. The All-In-One mod pack with AtmosFear 3 and Absolute Nature are just great. But without playing it vanilla first then you cant fully appreciate the mods. Dont spend your time making numerous saves because you arent sure what to sell and what to keep. Just go with it. Trust your gut. Move on. The game will be more fun. Also, pay attention to what people ssay. I lost focused during a few conversations fairly early on and I think I sold something that I needed to progress. Maybe I didnt. But I was stuck...somehow. And it was all because I got distracted by my GF yelling about something in the other room. It turned out to be a boy and now we are all very happy. I just wish she wouldnt distract me when Im trying to concentrate wheen its something she is perfectly capable of handling herself.\n\nThe game is a classic. If you dont own it, get it. If you refuse to buy it get medicated and do not send me a friend request, ever.\n\n10/10 - would ignore a living room birth again","January 27","true","14.3"," 2 of 3 people (67%) found this review helpful","67","2","3","0","0"

There are SO MANY problems with it, and yet I still enjoyed playing it. Is it a great game? NO. But is it a good game? MAYBE.\nI have seen other reviews claim CoP is a better, more challening Fallout, but this is simply not true.\n\nVISUALS\nEverything in this game is repetitive and ugly. I have seen multiple reviews, even professional ones, claim that the visuals in this game are great, and I absolutely do not see why! I am not talking about graphics, which are so obviously below standard it's not even worth criticism. No, I mean atmosphere and appearance. First, every area of the game has the same open fields, short hills, boring trees, bushes, and grass. There is nothing in the natural scene that is beautiful or scary (I even installed Atmosfear, which is a beautification mod). Every building is square and industrial, filled with empty, useless rooms. This, far and above, is awful to look at. CoP is FILLED with identical buildings!\n\nSecond, the oft-cited tense and scary atmosphere is present, albeit rarely. Truly scary or tense moments are governed by the RNG and therefore often missing. One of the "strengths" of this game, similar to Skyrim, is how independent the world is. Monsters and NPCs will spawn semi-randomly and often collide with the player and each other. However, this also means that the chances a creature will appear in empty building #127 that you exploring is actually very rare. Often I navigated a creepy abandoned factory (they're all factories, remember?) at night, with only a flashlight to guide me, all the while expecting some monstrosity to come at me, and NOTHING HAPPENED. I would find my loot, and go back to the safe zone, yet again. Boring. The best creepy moments, were the scripted ones at the end of the game! (which were few)\n\nCOMBAT\nThe second thing this game is known for is the FPS combat. One positive element of the game is that almost any enemy can kill you all by itself. Supposedly, this means you have to be very cautious in any combat situation and fight tactically. In reality, combat is the simplest rinse-and-repeat affair I have seen in many other games. Human enemies are a great example. If you are within firing range they WILL hit you (apparently every fool in the zone is an expert marksman) and kill you in a few shots. So, what is the strategy to defeat them? Easy: 1) hide behind cover, 2) pop out and headshot him, 3) consume a medkit to recover any damage. THAT'S IT. These three steps are pretty much the same for every enemy in the game, except for one that can go invisible (which is actually EASIER to kill). Headshots do very high damage (as they should in any serious FPS), but the moronic AI just stands there and shoots like a British Redcoat, so there is nothing stopping you from dropping enemies like flies. I have put hundreds of hours into TF2, so a headshot on a non-human player is like shooting fish in a barrel for me. I have literally stood in an open field, without cover, and killed four human attackers (NOT zombies) all firing at me without dying. Then, I just popped a couple medkits and waltzed away.\n\nWEAPONS/ARMOR/ITEMS\n*SPOILERS: I mention the names of weapon items, so if you want to learn them on your own, skip this section. *SPOILERS*\nThere are many weapons in this game, however, half of them are nearly identical, many of them are completely useless, and the good weapons are both rare, and hardly used. First, all pistols are useless and can be abandoned in the first ten minutes of the game once you kill a single human enemy and take his rifle. Second, the first three assault rifles that you have access to are nearly identical, and the most common one you come across, the AKM-74/2, is a superior weapon for more than half the game. You can attach a scope and a grenade launcher to it. The next best rifle that is encountered in the second area of the game, TRs 301, is the literal successor to the first one. It too can be upgraded with scope and grenade launcher. This or the SGI-5k, will serve you for the rest of the game. Finally, all you need after this is a shotgun and again, the second shotgun you will likely encounter, the SPSA-14, will serve you for more than half the game. I easily beat the entire game with this assault rifle and shotgun combo. I never needed another weapon. There are several stronger special weapons, but the big problem is, you don't have access to them until you reach the final level, which is something like 80% into the game! So you get these cool new weapons, and no time to use them. BOO.\n\nAnother note about weapons/armor. You can upgrade your weapons with technicians in safe areas, however, you have to find tools to give them to get access to the higher tier upgrades. It was an absolutely STUPID choice to put the final-tier tools in the last area of the game! Also, there is absolutely NO HINT where they are located, so you just have to exhaustively search every building in the final area to find them. What does this mean? Well, first, you will encounter every major enemy in the third area and kill it BEFORE you get the tools! Therefore, you will have fully explored the final area of the game BEFORE you can upgrade your weapons to the highest level! What that hell good is that!? What good is the amazing targeting scope on my sniper rifle when I already killed the 12 enemy fighters in the apartment building BEFORE I got it!? This is even worse with the armor. The best armor in the game does not allow you to run while wearing it until you have the final tier upgrade for it. Once again, this armor is completely uselss for 90% of the game.\n\nMAP LEVELS\nThe final frustrating element of this game is the map itself. So many players completely overlook that this game is really just a walking simulator. There is NO transportation or fast travel in this game. YOU. WALK. EVERYWHERE. Or more accurately, you sprint, walk, sprint, walk, eat a sausage, sprint, walk, sprint, walk, everywhere! You spend SO MUCH time walking! It's enfuriating. This game is not like Fallout/Skyrim where interesting events happen to you while you travel. At best you may happen upon some humans fending off a mutant attack. Honestly, the best strategy here is just to watch, because usually the mutants kill the humans, and you can loot their bodies. Otherwise, there is no reason to waste hours walking.

There are SO MANY problems with it, and yet I still enjoyed playing it. Is it a great game? NO. But is it a good game? MAYBE.\nI have seen other reviews claim CoP is a better, more challening Fallout, but this is simply not true.\n\nVISUALS\nEverything in this game is repetitive and ugly. I have seen multiple reviews, even professional ones, claim that the visuals in this game are great, and I absolutely do not see why! I am not talking about graphics, which are so obviously below standard it's not even worth criticism. No, I mean atmosphere and appearance. First, every area of the game has the same open fields, short hills, boring trees, bushes, and grass. There is nothing in the natural scene that is beautiful or scary (I even installed Atmosfear, which is a beautification mod). Every building is square and industrial, filled with empty, useless rooms. This, far and above, is awful to look at. CoP is FILLED with identical buildings!\n\nSecond, the oft-cited tense and scary atmosphere is present, albeit rarely. Truly scary or tense moments are governed by the RNG and therefore often missing. One of the "strengths" of this game, similar to Skyrim, is how independent the world is. Monsters and NPCs will spawn semi-randomly and often collide with the player and each other. However, this also means that the chances a creature will appear in empty building #127 that you exploring is actually very rare. Often I navigated a creepy abandoned factory (they're all factories, remember?) at night, with only a flashlight to guide me, all the while expecting some monstrosity to come at me, and NOTHING HAPPENED. I would find my loot, and go back to the safe zone, yet again. Boring. The best creepy moments, were the scripted ones at the end of the game! (which were few)\n\nCOMBAT\nThe second thing this game is known for is the FPS combat. One positive element of the game is that almost any enemy can kill you all by itself. Supposedly, this means you have to be very cautious in any combat situation and fight tactically. In reality, combat is the simplest rinse-and-repeat affair I have seen in many other games. Human enemies are a great example. If you are within firing range they WILL hit you (apparently every fool in the zone is an expert marksman) and kill you in a few shots. So, what is the strategy to defeat them? Easy: 1) hide behind cover, 2) pop out and headshot him, 3) consume a medkit to recover any damage. THAT'S IT. These three steps are pretty much the same for every enemy in the game, except for one that can go invisible (which is actually EASIER to kill). Headshots do very high damage (as they should in any serious FPS), but the moronic AI just stands there and shoots like a British Redcoat, so there is nothing stopping you from dropping enemies like flies. I have put hundreds of hours into TF2, so a headshot on a non-human player is like shooting fish in a barrel for me. I have literally stood in an open field, without cover, and killed four human attackers (NOT zombies) all firing at me without dying. Then, I just popped a couple medkits and waltzed away.\n\nWEAPONS/ARMOR/ITEMS\n*SPOILERS: I mention the names of weapon items, so if you want to learn them on your own, skip this section. *SPOILERS*\nThere are many weapons in this game, however, half of them are nearly identical, many of them are completely useless, and the good weapons are both rare, and hardly used. First, all pistols are useless and can be abandoned in the first ten minutes of the game once you kill a single human enemy and take his rifle. Second, the first three assault rifles that you have access to are nearly identical, and the most common one you come across, the AKM-74/2, is a superior weapon for more than half the game. You can attach a scope and a grenade launcher to it. The next best rifle that is encountered in the second area of the game, TRs 301, is the literal successor to the first one. It too can be upgraded with scope and grenade launcher. This or the SGI-5k, will serve you for the rest of the game. Finally, all you need after this is a shotgun and again, the second shotgun you will likely encounter, the SPSA-14, will serve you for more than half the game. I easily beat the entire game with this assault rifle and shotgun combo. I never needed another weapon. There are several stronger special weapons, but the big problem is, you don't have access to them until you reach the final level, which is something like 80% into the game! So you get these cool new weapons, and no time to use them. BOO.\n\nAnother note about weapons/armor. You can upgrade your weapons with technicians in safe areas, however, you have to find tools to give them to get access to the higher tier upgrades. It was an absolutely STUPID choice to put the final-tier tools in the last area of the game! Also, there is absolutely NO HINT where they are located, so you just have to exhaustively search every building in the final area to find them. What does this mean? Well, first, you will encounter every major enemy in the third area and kill it BEFORE you get the tools! Therefore, you will have fully explored the final area of the game BEFORE you can upgrade your weapons to the highest level! What that hell good is that!? What good is the amazing targeting scope on my sniper rifle when I already killed the 12 enemy fighters in the apartment building BEFORE I got it!? This is even worse with the armor. The best armor in the game does not allow you to run while wearing it until you have the final tier upgrade for it. Once again, this armor is completely uselss for 90% of the game.\n\nMAP LEVELS\nThe final frustrating element of this game is the map itself. So many players completely overlook that this game is really just a walking simulator. There is NO transportation or fast travel in this game. YOU. WALK. EVERYWHERE. Or more accurately, you sprint, walk, sprint, walk, eat a sausage, sprint, walk, sprint, walk, everywhere! You spend SO MUCH time walking! It's enfuriating. This game is not like Fallout/Skyrim where interesting events happen to you while you travel. At best you may happen upon some humans fending off a mutant attack. Honestly, the best strategy here is just to watch, because usually the mutants kill the humans, and you can loot their bodies. Otherwise, there is no reason to waste hours walking. To make matters worse, because your primary source of money in the game are special items called artifacts that are located in the far corners of each map and that respawn at random every few days, you will do A LOT of backtracking.\n\nFurthermore, the map is divided into three levels that you can only travel between by use of a guide. This "guide" is basically fast travel, since you talk to him, pay him money, and then you are instantly transported to the next area. You CANNOT access the other areas of the game on foot. You must PAY a guide to take you EVERY time you want to change levels (which is a lot). The reason for this is so obvious: the developers needed to separate all of the assets in the game so it wouldn't completely overload our computers. Finally, the third level of the game, which is really your primary goal, is both small and extremely short. What should be a climactic final level, is over in a handful of quests.\n\n\nHonestly, there are so many other things I could complain about, but I still choose to recommend this game because you can pick it up for nearly nothing during a sale. This game barely registers in the positive for me at a 6/10, but if you have a couple extra bucks come the next big sale, you may want to give it a try just to see what all the fuss is about.","May 1","true","43.2"," 3 of 5 people (60%) found this review helpful","60","3","5","0","0"

You only have a few supplies and if you go straight to the objectives you will likely find yourself having your body drained by a bloodsucker. How do you get better equipment? by exploring the world doing jobs for people, hunting mutants, hunting bandits or even becoming a bandit.\n\nYou are free to chase money for better equipment as much as you like, there is no timer or voice on a radio shouting for you to get to checkpoint alpha and shoot your quota of terrorists. Nope, you have all the time in the world to have fun and get absorbed into the world.\n\nA great inventory system means that you will always find yourself wondering which weapons you should take with you and how much ammo. The health system is also great with the depth of protection different armors adding more to it. You have bullet penetration and blunt force protection, first effects how easily you will bleed and the other how much health you lose when hit. There are also plenty of other protections provided from armor like radiation, acid, electrical  and a thermal. All the different damages that can effect your character add more to the medical system as different drugs and medpacks have different buffs and values. So before heading out you may have to decide whether or not to sell that scientic medpack for more ammo or keep it for an emergency.\n\nThe artifact system mixes in well with the gameplay as there is an array of different artifacts with some having very high values but also very usefull buffs. The way to get these artifacts is eithe to get lucky when looting a body or braving one of the many dangerous anomalies. The better and higher value artifacts will rarely turn up and only if you explore the more dangerous anomalies. Then when you do find one will you keep it to gain an additional 13Kg or sell it to able to afford that fancy exo-skeleton armor.\n\nWhen all this is put into practice the system performs very well with both mutants and humans. When fighting humans the AI is good enough that stealth is viable but hard, and that when ♥♥♥♥ hits the fan the combat is tough but enjoyable. Ths is not a run and gun game and if you try to charge head first you will quickly find it laying a few feet away from the bloody stump that is now your neck. The combat requires you to be able to think at least a little tactically as you have no regenerating health and limited medical supplies. The enemies wil even look towards where they last saw you and occasionaly try to flush you out with grenades, this enables you to slip out of sight and try and get a flank on them. At the end of a fight you feel like you deserved the victory because you worked for it, and then you get the satisfaction of rooting through the pockets of your dead enemies.\n\nThe AI also performs well when your fighting mutants. Dogs will swarm you in packs and if one is injured it will pull away to lick its wounds while two more dogs charge you. Bloodsuckers will sneak behind you and try to drain you of your blood, and there is very little more nerve wracking than hearing their cloaking sound and watching for their telltale shimmer. The AI performs well with the player having to change their playstyle to match what type of enemy they are fighting.\n\nAll in all S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat is a great addition to the series with superb gameplay melded into a well crafted world which you can truely be absorbed into. 10/10 brilliant game and totally recommend playing it.\n\n\nBONUS ADDITION- Beyond the original vanilla game there are a multitude of brilliant mods for it, ranging from simple graphics improvements to complete overhauls of the game. The community is brilliant and the modmakers are true fans of the game and this shows in some of the mods made for it. Highly recommend MISERY mod, which is a complete overhaul that adds a whole ♥♥♥♥-ton of depth with more weapons, drugs, armors, ammo, upgrades and even changes the medical system and AI to be even more realistic. If i had to give MISERY a score it would have to 11/10","October 3, 2014","true","92.5"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Clear Sky, the second installment to the franchise and a prequel to the first game, was an overwhelming disappointment. I was skeptical when coming to Call of Pripyat, but I can say without a doubt in my mind, that this is one of the greatest video games of all time.\n\nSTORY\nWhere Clear Sky faltered with a dull story, Call of Pripyat brings forth a new, compelling, and interesting story that spans throughout untold countless hours of gameplay. For the first time, optional missions and side quests have their own stories, ranking among my favourites in RPGs. Memorable missions such as sneaking through a lair of sleeping Bloodsuckers, joining a team of hunters to kill a massive Chimera, overseeing a trade of information between enemy factions and then sniping them from a distance, and discovering the secrets hidden throughout the Pripyat area make the side missions a wonder to play through. While the central story isn't as deep and strong as the first game, it can be expanded upon through hundreds of optional missions which alone give the game far more replayability. A cast of new and surprisingly memorable characters filters into the game, all with their own distinctive and unique personality traits. For the first time, we finally get to go deeper into the city of Pripyat, to explore the old ruins of the world's biggest ghost town.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nStrong gunplay against intelligent enemy fighters and nightmarish mutants with a set of their own unique attacks ranks Call of Pripyat among some of the best FPS games I've ever played. Weapons will jam after prolonged use and wear, enemies will relentlessly and savagely attack you, flanking, taking cover, reacting in new and dynamic ways, even traveling around the world and engaging in fights among themselves. Suits and weapons can be seamlessly upgraded through assisting characters. This is undoubtedly the strongest of the series.\n\nGRAPHICS\nMuch like Clear Sky, the visuals just seem to fall flat. They're beautiful, most certainly, but there's simply little to no immersion like the first game. While there are haunting environments and surreal moments when you reach the dead city, I simply didn't get the same feelings that sparked through me as I assaulted the Brain Scorcher, fought waves of charging mutants, and battled my way inside the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Shadow of Chernobyl. Visually, the game does look quite good, though I am sorey disappointed to see that the beautifully detailed and ominous cutscenes present in the first two games are suddenly and without warning absent from Call of Pripyat. The jerky, awkward in-game cutscenes are laughable at best, and the slideshow cutscenes in the beginning and end of the game are groan inducing and all around pitiful attempts to recreate the CGI of the first to games. Nonetheless, graphically the game is stellar, and even running at medium settings the game still looks great.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\nUnfortunately, I have never seen more than one other person playing the multiplayer of this game, and therefore cannot make a full review on that particular portion. However, from what I've tested, the game modes look fun, gameplay is very much intact, and the new maps look interesting and well-detailed. If you have a few friends who want to play, a private lobby for this game looks like it could be unending fun.\n\nVERDICT\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat is a well polished, fun, entertaining, and overall incredible game. It took me nearly 17 hours to complete the main story, and I still haven't even scratched the surface of the overall package with the wealth of optional missions and exploration available to the player. While the story may not stack up to the mystery and horror of Shadow of Chernobyl, and while the survival/horror gameplay present in the first game is still quite lackluster, Call of Pripyat proves itself to be a fantastic experience. Had I not owned a PC of my own at the time of my playthrough of this game, I would have sold all of my consoles soley to play Call of Pripyat. A strong modding community keeps the game fresh and exciting, and I highly suggest that before playing, everyone install the S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat COMPLETE mod, as it enhances the visuals and adds a few new and fun mechanics that blend seamlessly with the central game. I didn't think anything could beat the first game, but this alone proves me wrong. The only true complaints I have are minor and do not derive from the full package. This is a game that I will be playing for years to come and still will find it new and fascinating each and every time I play. This is money well spent and perhaps one of the greatest video games ever made. With that said, the final verdict of S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat, is an astounding 10/10. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'll be trying to figure out how to kill all of these mutants and keep the bandits off my back.","August 18, 2014","true","24.6"," 1 of 2 people (50%) found this review helpful","50","1","2","0","0"

Clear Sky, the second installment to the franchise and a prequel to the first game, was an overwhelming disappointment. I was skeptical when coming to Call of Pripyat, but I can say without a doubt in my mind, that this is one of the greatest video games of all time.\n\nSTORY\nWhere Clear Sky faltered with a dull story, Call of Pripyat brings forth a new, compelling, and interesting story that spans throughout untold countless hours of gameplay. For the first time, optional missions and side quests have their own stories, ranking among my favourites in RPGs. Memorable missions such as sneaking through a lair of sleeping Bloodsuckers, joining a team of hunters to kill a massive Chimera, overseeing a trade of information between enemy factions and then sniping them from a distance, and discovering the secrets hidden throughout the Pripyat area make the side missions a wonder to play through. While the central story isn't as deep and strong as the first game, it can be expanded upon through hundreds of optional missions which alone give the game far more replayability. A cast of new and surprisingly memorable characters filters into the game, all with their own distinctive and unique personality traits. For the first time, we finally get to go deeper into the city of Pripyat, to explore the old ruins of the world's biggest ghost town.\n\nGAMEPLAY\nStrong gunplay against intelligent enemy fighters and nightmarish mutants with a set of their own unique attacks ranks Call of Pripyat among some of the best FPS games I've ever played. Weapons will jam after prolonged use and wear, enemies will relentlessly and savagely attack you, flanking, taking cover, reacting in new and dynamic ways, even traveling around the world and engaging in fights among themselves. Suits and weapons can be seamlessly upgraded through assisting characters. This is undoubtedly the strongest of the series.\n\nGRAPHICS\nMuch like Clear Sky, the visuals just seem to fall flat. They're beautiful, most certainly, but there's simply little to no immersion like the first game. While there are haunting environments and surreal moments when you reach the dead city, I simply didn't get the same feelings that sparked through me as I assaulted the Brain Scorcher, fought waves of charging mutants, and battled my way inside the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant in Shadow of Chernobyl. Visually, the game does look quite good, though I am sorey disappointed to see that the beautifully detailed and ominous cutscenes present in the first two games are suddenly and without warning absent from Call of Pripyat. The jerky, awkward in-game cutscenes are laughable at best, and the slideshow cutscenes in the beginning and end of the game are groan inducing and all around pitiful attempts to recreate the CGI of the first to games. Nonetheless, graphically the game is stellar, and even running at medium settings the game still looks great.\n\nMULTIPLAYER\nUnfortunately, I have never seen more than one other person playing the multiplayer of this game, and therefore cannot make a full review on that particular portion. However, from what I've tested, the game modes look fun, gameplay is very much intact, and the new maps look interesting and well-detailed. If you have a few friends who want to play, a private lobby for this game looks like it could be unending fun.\n\nVERDICT\nS.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat is a well polished, fun, entertaining, and overall incredible game. It took me nearly 17 hours to complete the main story, and I still haven't even scratched the surface of the overall package with the wealth of optional missions and exploration available to the player. While the story may not stack up to the mystery and horror of Shadow of Chernobyl, and while the survival/horror gameplay present in the first game is still quite lackluster, Call of Pripyat proves itself to be a fantastic experience. Had I not owned a PC of my own at the time of my playthrough of this game, I would have sold all of my consoles soley to play Call of Pripyat. A strong modding community keeps the game fresh and exciting, and I highly suggest that before playing, everyone install the S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: Call of Pripyat COMPLETE mod, as it enhances the visuals and adds a few new and fun mechanics that blend seamlessly with the central game.

Far shorter than the original SoC. 3 large areas. Not as challenging as CS/SoC, but still a great experience overall. I put a ton of time just upgrading weapons/armor and finding artifacts. One thing to note: When you finally go to Pripyat, make sure you do not have stuff in your personal stashes. I lost all my weapons/armors that way. It ticked me off so much I just decided to go through to end the game quickly. I did not do faction stuff since in CS that made the game tons harder. I tried to stay as neutral as I could, so I didn't have to deal with bandits/stalkers/freedom/duty. It was enough with the mutants. :P I do intend to repay it only because I know that there is that evil personal stash deletion after arriving in Pripyat.

Simply getting out of the starting area can create levels of frustration far in excess of a large portion of Dark Souls' story mode. The sun also gives you radiation poisoning, meaning you will have to choose between glowing to death, or getting ripped apart by the nocturnal mutants of the Zone.

Far shorter than the original SoC. 3 large areas. Not as challenging as CS/SoC, but still a great experience overall. I put a ton of time just upgrading weapons/armor and finding artifacts. One thing to note: When you finally go to Pripyat, make sure you do not have stuff in your personal stashes. I lost all my weapons/armors that way. It ticked me off so much I just decided to go through to end the game quickly. I did not do faction stuff since in CS that made the game tons harder. I tried to stay as neutral as I could, so I didn't have to deal with bandits/stalkers/freedom/duty. It was enough with the mutants. :P I do intend to repay it only because I know that there is that evil personal stash deletion after arriving in Pripyat.

It's honestly a GOOD game, but gets severely butchered by awful performance. The atmosphere, the lighting, the mods, the horror and survival elements are done well enough to keep me playing for awhile, that's until the stuttering gets worse and worse to the point where it becomes a huge chore to continue, which really sucks because I could play this game forever without the technical flaws. STALKER gives me feelings that I don't get in other games. I'm saddened to leave it behind. I strongly feel that STALKER needs a reboot. I would play the föck out of a new STALKER game running on a beefier engine, like the 4A engine! The extra polish would be well-deserved. I'm deeply sorry to give thumbs down, but CoP goes against what makes a game a game - Stability. Without a stable framerate, how do you apply/develop skills or even stay immersed? Such a shame. Good effort, but better luck next time, future devs. I'm out of here, stalker.\n\nAdditional info (in case you haven't said "F U!!!" already):\nI finished the story once on sheeti pc hardware (dafuq was wrong with me?). I now run a Core i5-4460, GTX 970 SSC, 8GB RAM, 120GB SSD and a G-Sync monitor, and can't finished the damn thing. Yes, I've tried many fixes online, including the 'Complete' mod. Nothing works.

The excellent Atmospheric FPS series that rose from the ashes after the death of GSC and the STALKER series. This series has some of the best atmosphere ever seen in first-person shooters. Metro continued that tradition and arguably has better atmosphere albeit in a smaller space. The only FPS that comes to mind in atmosphere to me at the moment would be The Darkness video game from 2007 by Starbreeze.\n\nLong version with possible spoilers.\n\nSTALKER takes place in a fictional modern times where the Chernobyl power plant accident had lasting and terrifying effects on the earth and wildlife around it. Mutants, deadly fauna, radiation pockets, killer anomalies, clashing factions and bandits all exist and contend with each other in this post-apocolyptic slice of Ukraine. The radioactive fallout from the reactor cores exploding left Chernobyl and its outlying towns abandoned by civilians and open to the exploitation factions and mercenaries. The Atmosphere gives a bleak outlook with people dying constantly in gruesome ways from being mauled to drowning in radioactive water or being torn to pieces by a viscious anomally. Mutants roam the contrysides looking for fresh food from anyone or anything. Bandits harass every faction or person they can find and often shoot on sight just to save themselves some trouble. Scientists have mercenaries working to protect them as they fight to keep their research continuing and out of the wrong hands. The military constantly tries to muscle its way in to take control of everything, and is allied with no one but themselves. There are 2 main factions Duty and Freedom. They constantly fight each other for differing beliefs while the military tries to control the zone entirely. Throughout the game you'll get opportunities to support whatever factions you'd like, even the bandits, and with several more factions that i didn't list being in the game, the possibilities are many and varied.\n\nThe Atmosphere is stunning and is oozing with detail. The gamplay itself is great, not the pinnacle of first-person shooters but solid across the board and excelling in certain aspects. The gunplay is precise but also has a nice level of upredictability that challenges the player. Often a small encounter with as little as 2 or 3 well armed soldiers can quickly lead to your death if not handled well and without precise shooting. There isn't a massive amount of different guns to be found but each gun will carry distict advantages or disadvantages. All weapons are upgradable and customizable with upgrade trees and attachments, leading to more meaningful weapon statistic differences and each weapon type has at least 2 ammunition types for different enemies. There are many different armor suits to find, some of them come with a helmet attached, some you can choose the helmet or gasmask you want. All the armors and helmets are also upgradeable with upgrade trees that give different bonuses. You can kill a soldier off in the distance whose gun you want and claim it for your own, or you can do missions around the local stronghold or your favorite faction and earn new armor, guns and ammo, some of them faction specific.\n\nThe story is pretty good and has many different paths to take. There's many endings and many interesting characters. The game doesn't have much voice acting or at least not in the english version, but the story still holds its own. Its an intersting setting with cool ideas and at the center of it stands The Zone. The big mystery of the entire game. What is The Zone? Is it sentient? Does it control all the creatures that have resulted from the fallout? Does it have psychic abilities? Did it cause all the chaos and damage? Is it afraid of humans? So many questions, so many theories and so many people fighting over ideals and the opportunity to get to the center of the entire incident, The Zone.\n\nEverything about this game is well done and well thought out. The gunplay is solid accross the board. the graphics are great and at the time, were cutting edge. The atmosphere is rivaled only by a select few in the genre. The story is interesting. The setting is unique as is the premise. The RPG elements are great but not overbearing to those who aren't fans of the genre. All in all this game is the best and most refined game of a series of amazing and undervalued games from the 2000-2010 decade. It is a must buy to Metro fans, FPS fans, hardcore gamers and pretty much anyone who enjoys a great atmosphere and an excellent melting pot of awesome mechanics. The game has done its part to earn its loyal fan base and you owe to yourself to at least try it out. Pick up the 1st game, S.T.A.L.K.E.R. Shadow of Chernobyl, and see where it takes you. I'd bet good money you won't be dissapointed.\n\nGraphics 8.5/10 (9.5 in 2007 when SoC 1st released).\nGameplay 9/10\nStory 8.5/10\nAtmosphere 10/10\n\nCall of Pripyat gets a 9.5/10 from me.\n\nThe entire series gets a 9/10.

It was cheap so I figured why not and I purchased the game. I started the game and was immediatly thrown into a giant world without a clear objective and I was a bit confused. Eventually I found the main base of the stalkers. I enjoyed it . BUt it got boring. It was a bit easy even with the added survival aspect. I laid it off and stoped playing.

The game allows for VERY dynamic things to happen and some (maybe most I'm not really sure) have a real life scenario. I missed a target in a mission and failed it, no retries. Although I'm not really sure if it had a real effect on what happened to me it did impress me at the time. Sometimes things just complete themselves when you're not there because the game doesnt really revolve around you. You're just there to enjoy it. I did sure enjoy it too, lots of things to do, dynamic EVERYTHING (varies), very scary and suspensful moments, not being invincible at all, and just having an almost open world (different zones but mostly open). This game and the series is a must play and even if it does get boring or even not that challenging, there are many MANY mods to make it different and even more diverse.

By far the most playable and enjoyable title in the Stalker trilogy. There are a few of pacing issues and the story just isn't exactly gripping but\nthey cut down on the random firefights and all out action so you get to actually enjoy the scenery and really take in the morbid atmosphere of the deserted, nuclear wasteland that is the Zone.\nSneaking through some run down garages or factory halls at night with thunderstorms roaring outside has never felt so intense - most likely the closest thing to actually being there.\n\nGame still has a ton of glitches, bugs and errors all around and even modding doesn't fix it all plus the gunplay is just as broken (some say realistic) as in the previous games (thank the Monolith for mechs and weapon upgrades). Still, it is the most userfriendly and probably least quirky of the trilogy - just lacking a bit of the excitement and mysticism of the original, but it excels at everything else.","August 9, 2012","true","11.9"," 1 of 3 people (33%) found this review helpful","33","1","3","0","0"

There's just so much effort in these games and they're so underrated... These games are honestly for me more fun than Fallout, and I think anyone who calls themselves a PC gamer should try Call Of Pripyat and Shadow Of Chernobyl. 10/10","August 18, 2014","true","29.4"," 0 of 1 people (0%) found this review helpful","0","0","1","0","0"
