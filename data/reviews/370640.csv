And while Drac is indeed a presence to be dealt with, the story is much more involved and complex than I imagined. A very well told story that will catch you by surprise with its many twists and turns, it begins in a very benign and sort of whimsical fashion meeting the main character, Sidni, as she goes about her daily hum-drum chores assisting her mom, Diana.\nSo, stay with it, because after a series of routine tasks, the story takes a very dark and dangerous turn as Sidni goes on a long journey to discover the truth of the past concerning herself and her mother. (Of course the intro before the prologue lets you know that Dracula is behind all that is not well.)\n\nSo much of a good rpg depends on the story, and the story telling is this game's strongest quality. You will need to pay careful attention to the dialogues and by doing so will be drawn in to a highly interesting and carefully laid out tale.\n\nOf course, there are many battles to be fought, and they, too, are more involved than many rpgs. Careful battle planning (which characters to use what, which monsters to fight/avoid, which items/magic to use, etc.) is a must for this game.\n\nSecrets are plentiful, the areas to search and explore are dungeon-like in their layouts, and treasures are uniquely done (get the shovel early!). It never gets boring, and the game (so far, for me) gets more and more interesting the farther you advance.\n\nAnd there is a lot of humor in the game to lighten the dark tone involving Dracula, his minions, and other monsters ---- a good touch.\n\nSo explore thoroughly, read everything, and talk to everyone, and you will be rewarded with a rich, very satisfying rpg that I am glad to recommend.\n","May 29, 2015","true","48.7"," 42 of 47 people (89%) found this review helpful","89","42","47","0","0"

It definitely has some good qualifications and it has some amazing POTENTIAL. But there are some pretty big negatives that make it very hard to recommend it to someone else. Let's starts withe positives....\n\nPros:\n1. The money or "Krona" is pretty easy to come by. Once you get the shovel there are tons of places you can dig and get free money from it. The weapons and armor are all relatively cheap so far so you don't usually have any issues with being able to afford the next level of gear.\n\n2. Almost every monster fight drops small "health potions" or "sassy rolls" as they are called in this game. So you really don't have to ever buy many of those leaving more money for weapons and armor.\n\n3. The storyline is really good. It's interesting with interesting characters. To be honest the story line is one of the only reason I am still playing the game at this point in.\n\n4. I like the controls. It feels much like the Aveyond games which I happen to love very much.\n\n5. Visable monsters....I hate when you can't see them and never know when you are going to get attacked.\n\nNow let's get to those Cons:\n1. There are monsters literally EVERYWHERE! One of the things I hate about the games that don't have visable monsters is that you get attacked every 3 steps....well the monsters might be visable in this game but you still get attacked every 3 freakin steps. You CAN'T avoid them. They all make a very fast beeline straight for you and there is no going around them. Lord help you if you get lost and go to a different board and have to come back because ALL OF THE MONSTERS YOU JUST KILLED ARE NOW BACK!!! I would be ok with the 6,000 monsters (maybe) if they didn't come BACK everytime you leave and reneter the area. It's never ending,\nendless battles, one after another....over and over again. There is just too much endless fighting.\n\n2. Now I would almost be ok with the endless fighting (but not really) IF it was leveling my characters up and making them stronger BUT IT'S NOT! It is absolutely insane how long it takes you to get a single level in this game! I have been playing for 8 hours....and much of that is fighting monsters and my highest character is a level 15! That is UNREAL!\n\n3. The areas are like a MAZE! it's back and forth and back and forth through endless monsters and I haven't found a single map of any of the areas on google or anything. yes, I could pay for the strategy guide but I hate to pay 5 bucks for a guide to a game that I may not even finish. The guide is not available for free anywhere that I could find.\n\n4. There isn't an "easy, medium or hard" mode and the fights are super hard. Especially during the times that you only have 1 or 2 people in your party. The boss fights are unrealistically difficult! The 2nd (I believe) fight is with 7 vampires at one time against 2 of your party and it took me 5 tries to figure out how to beat them.\nSo for now, I will stick with it maybe a couple more hours but if it doesnt get any better then I won't be finishing it. Which is a darn shame because overall the game has a ton of potential and I REALLY want to like it.....","April 6","false","19.1"," 4 of 4 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","4","4","0","0"

The story and dialogue was interesting, as well as entertaining. Every character had their own little and unique persona to them, making them different from one another and all the more loveable. Despite what the negative reviews from other people suggests, I'd recommend those who are interested in playing the game to not take other people's opinions into account, but rather surprise themselves with the results of actually playing the game. Overall, I enjoyed the game and would most definitely like a sequel or a DLC of some sort (not sure how that'll be possible, lol).\n\nALSO!\n\nI ship Sidni and Estradi so much. <3","March 26","true","27.1"," 2 of 2 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","2","2","0","1"

The fact of the matter is that it's not just one minor bug here and there but massive game crippling bugs. and looking past that the game become tedious. Every batle is frout with so many misses it make it mind numbing. the story continues to break the 4th wall for no reason. There are a few funny bits here and there but it donesnt make up for the colasale ammount of bugs. It has potential but given the fact that its not this devlopers first product.

Why her mom was hiding her from vampires? What’s the use of the amulet on Sidni? There’s the mystery of Sidni’s parents identity, also why is she chased by Dracula? You’ll learn more little by little.\n\nPROs:\n- worth the money, did it in 22h\n- Unique story of Sidni’s personal quest of her origins\n- Learn about characters’ backstory, they have bahavious and way of speaking\n-  Find NPCs from the tale and acquaintances from aveyond games,  in a city for the dead\n-  Animated NPC: a gunsmith, a blacksmith, sweep.\n- A “Royal Trap” soundtrack in a city, it’s HQ with piano and guitar.\n- Lots of use of the shovel.\n- A lot of humour: bandits arguing, an upset character, an uneasy situation\n- Witty dialogue, judgment on vampires . The Dialogue goes against prejudices. Characters advises each other, some psychology.\n\nCons:\n- Bugs cos of steam adds in the game, I had to mail talk with the willing developer\n- I was bored killing wolves in the Divide, no shortcut bubble to not cross it again.\n- I got nervous to not be able to evade easily monsters at a square room as I didn’t find the straight order of doing things after the dungeon.\n- A few “unending” time of battle bosses.\n- Infos on monsters weakness is irrelevant. Despite the max level, there’s a lack in skills to better fight.\n- The end falls short, could be filled with an end for each character. But the sequel has been released!\n\nBuy it for a well made story of Sidni discovering her origins, meet a vampire of justice, a pitiless tracker and a victim werewolf, make their acquaintance, read morale and kick the butt of the villain.","November 4, 2015","true","22.4"," 5 of 11 people (45%) found this review helpful 1 person found this review funny","45","5","11","0","0"
