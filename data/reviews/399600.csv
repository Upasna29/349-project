And this game is made by ONE person, nearly one. All design, program, art and music is made by that person. This game is a casual puzzle platformer game. Player contro two black cats at same time, let them been photographed in the frame. The game is simple, relax, a bit challenging. The whole game is not too long, I completely finish the game with about 3 to 4 hours.\n\nThe game made by this only person, is not just a game for him I think. It looks like a self description for him, or the progress of making this game. This game make me feel that lonely is not so bad sometime.\n\nAnd at last, the music of this game sounds very well. And the more exciting thing is: the developer is going to make OST FREE.\n\n+Unique art style\n+Sweet music\n+Suitable level difficulty\n\n-Puzzle part is a bit weak\n\n8/10 for this game.\n\n\n\n先来说说结论，I And Me是国内少有的良心做，一人独自完成的轻松向平台解谜类游戏，注意是一人！准确来说应该是所有的设计、程序、美术和音乐这些核心内容是一人完成的。在这个游戏中，玩家需要同时控制两只黑猫，跑到相框中照相。游戏比较简单，却也十分放松。整个游戏时长不会太久，本人大约花了3、4小时就通关并全成就了。\n\n这个游戏，其实更像是作者对于自我的阐述；也可能更像是作者制作游戏的过程。通篇体现的是唯美的孤独。\n\n最后说说，游戏的音乐是这个游戏的亮点。优美的音乐很好地撑起了整个游戏。另外作者有意向将OST免费放出。冲着这免费OST，也该支持一下作者呀~\n\n+独特的美术风格\n+甜美的音乐\n+适度的关卡难度\n\n-解谜部分稍弱\n\n打分 8/10","May 5","true","7.3"," 44 of 52 people (85%) found this review helpful 6 people found this review funny","85","44","52","6","0"

You play as two cats who both move simutaneously with your inputs, which forces you to think how you can move one without getting the other hurt.\n+ Visually the game looks very nice, with a very pretty looking environment\n+ Nice and relaxing classical soundtrack\n+ 90 Levels\n\n- I felt like the game was a bit too simplistic, and needed more things to do besides just moving left and right and jumping. Perhaps more story elements would have helped as well.","May 31","true","8.6"," 12 of 12 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","12","12","0","0"

After getting the game, though, I was not disappointed in the slightest. The story as well as the idea of a second self mirroring your actions was presented in an orignal way, and composed the story-telling in a way that keeps the player engaged until the end.\n\nIt may because I played it so much, but the game seemed a bit short, and left me wanting to play more (obviously, I still play the game often). My favourite part, though, was the absolutely beautiful colours and music. The colours and music throughout all of the seasons were unbelieveably fantastic.\n\nOverall a great game!","May 29","true","7.6"," 7 of 7 people (100%) found this review helpful","100","7","7","0","0"
